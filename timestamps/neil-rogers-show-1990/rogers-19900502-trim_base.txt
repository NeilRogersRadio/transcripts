[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580]
Okay, 25 after 10. I don't know what that card is. Who's is that says random sounds?

[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.860]
Maybe that's theirs who would let's start playing their material anyway look at those broward lines

[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.560]
524 W. I. O. D. and Broward and the Palm Beach is also open 655. Oh you gave out the numbers. Yes, I will

[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.400]
I learned my lesson yesterday

[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.840]
Anyway, the Cubs because it was a late game last night kicked that they were behind 4 to 1 against the Giants early

[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.200]
And then they came back and Dunston had a home run to put him ahead and they beat the Giants 7 to 4 and

[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.100]
The unlucky one is first game don't only got the win

[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.680]
Dawson had another home and the Sandberg had a home run and

[00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.940]
The Metz by the way are now tied with the Cubs in last place

[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.420]
But the two teams are going in different directions the Metz the Cubs are now hitting and still getting good pitching and the Metz are

[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.080]
Incredible. Hojo threw another one away last night and Derek Lilliquis the Braves pitcher hit two home runs off

[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.980]
Rondarling not one but two and the Metz took the pipe again

[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.020]
Not at that idiot get fine for holding the ball while two runs scored. I don't know

[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.660]
I mean there's a big big things in a paper. I don't know if he's gonna get fined boneheads all the Broward

[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.440]

[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.380]

We had Howard Stern and Maryland and we ran him off to New York. Yeah, he's pretty bad

[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.260]
Well, how it's got a crappy hairdo. You know, yeah, that's all the Broward lines. What was that just all nuts?

[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.200]

[00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.620]
Well, you never know. Yeah, so I wanted to ask you I just arrived here

[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.800]
And I'd like to know some nice places to go some people that were telling me not to go down to Holland

[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.220]
Don't be Toronto's not too bad

[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.700]
What is he now you're gonna be started again that the food I would like to will let call Rick and Puts yesterday about

[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.980]
How I'm so negative about the area and we know things are bad

[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.680]
We don't want to keep hearing it. Oh, it's great. Oh, anti-stand crate. Cranks for calling great. Well screw them. Okay. Oh my god

[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.980]
Screw them right? You can't even get a job down here unless you know Spanish exactly. I know

[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.820]
Come on Staddy. I don't know what over to Besa you get hired there in like 10 seconds. Oh where the bass

[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.740]
I that's like in her harbor. Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right

[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.620]
No English allowed. I love Baltimore. You do. I was gonna ask you what you think about the Orioles

[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.340]
You have to ask you don't know anything about sports. I don't know I start with the sports again

[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.440]
The okay, we don't want to get two sports intensive, but Besa it is like in her harbor

[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.240]
So if you enjoy in her harbor you should enjoy Besa I'd accept that it is predominantly Spanish by

[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.480]
Participating in so many sports. I'm not trying to get my picture on a weedie's box. I love sports good

[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.280]
So my dad was telling me not to go to Holland, no beach because you can't find any well

[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.040]
There's nobody under the age of a hundred over there. Is that right? Yeah, how old are you dear? Are you under a hundred?

[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.200]
Yeah, why did you come here? Did you you like it lost?

[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.680]
No, I went through a bad divorce. I thought I come down here. Oh, and really get depressed

[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.320]
Well, don't listen to the show because I'm depressing and I have a negative crappy attitude and

[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.980]
I'm just not positive, you know like people have worked for a week

[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.860]
Oh, I'm not thinking on them. They're good guys, but the audience man this audience wait till you hear these people

[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.680]
Oh, you're so much better than this one, but you're not as good as that one

[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.180]
And you know all these instant next words. I get one letter here from Dick Purton and Detroit this morning

[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.340]
And it means more than 500

[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.700]
Puts would be program directors out there in the audience who think they know the business who think they know anything

[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.940]
You know, I mean D you don't know what I'm talking about. Oh, yes, I do good. I work for attorneys in Maryland

[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.980]

You know, and there's luxury. So what do you tell your kids about what? What the hell is wrong with that?

[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.880]

Now you're going to talk about there. There's a singular card. Madonna. Come on. Don't start ripping them even though you hate them like poison. Madonna and our sinew. But first on the facts machine. I don't know what paper this is out of, but there's a letter a hysterical hostile letter from a lady from St. Martin in the Netherlands.

[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:40.320]
And until he's about how she came to visit. Boka, how the hell she chose Boka? I have no idea about the people sucked and people with such close minds and mistrusting and psychotic. See, it's just me. I'm just a bad guy. I mean, here's a lady came here for the first time. She's 34 years old. I don't know.

[00:08:49.620 --> 00:09:10.300]

He used to go into the tender box at the Broward Mall occasionally. It disappeared. Now, the tender box at Bocatown Center is going to disappear. Guess what? There both. Both malls are co-managed. Isn't that interesting? It's a big thing. Did you see in the paper the other day about how Bocatown Center might be squeezing out a lot of the money. It's a big thing.

[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.860]
merchants that's right there's something like twenty or twenty five or so that

[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.720]

[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.940]
that little baby boy

[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:32.620]
all

[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.420]

[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.040]
how's the wife and how's the kid

[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.560]

[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.660]
i love wonderful family man but put up that stoke it'll kill you

[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.600]
i wanted to ask you about that what

[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:51.780]
uh...

[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:58.400]
you don't inhale cigars and get into your lungs and cause all that mung

[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.360]
to coagulate and uh... accumulate

[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.800]
it doesn't get in there

[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.320]
exactly

[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.360]
like a lot of other things

[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.200]
well how are you dog

[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.020]
my dogs are wonderful

[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.700]
well good

[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.100]
right

[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.840]
my big dog thinks he's an elephant

[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.680]
he looks like it

[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.080]
no i don't mean that when he squats down he thinks he's an elephant

[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.220]
oh god you've never seen anything like that

[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.160]
does it show in the backyard?

[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:20.740]
yes

[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.080]
my backyard is a minefield

[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:28.600]
you have to put on your hip boots almost like listening to the reneerie show you

[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.760]

[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.980]

[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.300]
how come i've been here a long time we never pick on him

[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.740]
nobody ever picks on it

[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.580]
well it's because he minds his own business and he's smart enough to stay out

[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.180]
everybody's way

[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.440]
he's doing his own thing

[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.060]
exactly

[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.600]

[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.820]
question speaking of sucking the big one like this call let me ask you a

[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.880]
question yeah if you didn't enjoy what you're listening to why did you change

[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.200]
a dial why do you have you well that's great no i don't want to listen but

[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.740]
why do you feel compelled to tell us well i

[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:16.080]
uh... if i if i'm watching or listening to something i don't find it interesting or i don't like it

[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:23.520]
what i do i switch the channel because it's it's annoying that's why you don't have to listen to it

[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.720]
it's just like somebody got to have you would take a hostage if somebody got a gun to your dead head

[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:32.960]
if somebody got a gun to your head somebody forcing you to listen to the other guy you hear what

[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.980]
what they were here what lightest in the other there where somebody doesn't agree with

[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:44.220]

[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.160]

[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:50.760]
hello hi hi this is kathy on the nurse who called us a couple weeks ago hi kathy how are you

[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.920]
how are you doing thank you for the call kathy you picked him in the push you know it's really

[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.540]
funny that everybody keeps saying that i don't want to i don't want to take away any credit because

[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:05.720]
you were very observant but the fact that i went to the hospital had nothing to do with your call

[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.580]
i don't want you to feel bad but i mean i don't feel bad i'm glad i'm glad that you know that but

[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.380]
it's like everybody says boy thank goodness that nurse called you and warned you and you're you

[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:18.120]
know it was a nice call but that had nothing to do with it that's fine now i know that because

[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.800]
i was stupid there was something wrong no yeah and i was stupid and i thought well i'll go

[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.440]
home and lay down for a while i feel better and i didn't and then i said well there is something

[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.360]
wrong and i'm going i'm just i was very concerned and i i felt i had a problem well i'm doing

[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.640]
real well and of course there's some people in the other that's another thing that ticked me off

[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:37.280]
when i was listening yesterday here i had a stroke less than a month ago okay and i'm not looking

[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.600]
for sympathy but the point is a stroke is not like having a migraine headache as you know it's a

[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:47.020]
serious blow to the to your system and your body you you have no energy and it takes a long time

[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.920]
to get back to where you were and these people think like well i sit here and i'm going to go

[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.340]
through hell on a year and in the building and people are going nuts and i'm just going to be

[00:20:55.340 --> 00:21:00.100]
oblivious i can't do it i'm not Superman i'm a human being and a lot of these people all they know

[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:06.220]
is a radio show well life is more than just a radio show right it helps most important man you bet

[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:10.440]
i'm not going to kill myself for a bunch of slime balls out there who think i'm you know i'm

[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.780]
supposed to be here to keep them in a good mood all day like you made a remarkable recovery sound

[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:18.920]
yeah well i'm doing real good today i feel a little flush you know i don't know what that is

[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.420]
that flush feeling in the face maybe the tidie bullman knows but that's because the cubs one last

[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:29.400]
yeah that must be it oh it sounds like you're taking care of yourself and uh change in your

[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.500]
lifestyle a little bit i'm trying i'm not eating anything that is not my diet and i'm sticking

[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:37.800]
out you know the only other thing i'm going to get on my exercise by today i was a real another

[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.440]
stupid thing i did i kept trying to do two three minutes at a time on it and i would be like

[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.640]
ready to pass out and then my friend day was over yesterday and he got he's looked at the thing

[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.800]
he said you got this thing tightened as tight as it'll go i wasn't even thinking about that you

[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.360]
know every exercise bike has got a looser or tighter thing you know and so we loosened it up and

[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.960]
now it's a snap you know so i guess even hercules couldn't have done three minutes on that bike

[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.460]
well i'm glad you doing better Neil yeah i'm doing real good and welcome back thanks a lot Kathy

[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:12.060]
okay you take care bye bye 10 54 at w-i-o-d oh now see we're getting close to the news here's that

[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.560]
syndrome again oh yeah that we have three open lines this is another part of the new routine i

[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.220]
mentioned this about i know four or five months ago they started it and did you do that at night

[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:25.180]
while it just shows you that we're not as important in their lives as we used to be used to be they

[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:29.560]
would hang on forever you remember those days i'm sure you do it wins when we really when we had

[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:35.620]
an audience and we'd come in and like two minutes before my show the news was on so there nobody

[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.900]
in the studio two minutes till 10 all the lines would start flashing you didn't have to even be

[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:45.540]
on the air much less give the numbers out and then you'd come on at two and it would start again

[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:52.060]
like right after the news they all died hang it on huh it died it too no all right it died because

[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:58.240]
you suck ah seriously i'm telling you and that lasted for i don't know two three months something

[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:03.300]
like that but those were the days boy i mean those people would have held on for three hours

[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:08.280]
because they just were into it now it's like you people start taking stuff or granted and one day

[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:15.180]
you wake up and somebody's gone you know i will say this afternoon draw no more studio audience

[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:20.800]
and you know you start taking people for granted afternoon draw no more new draws in here running

[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.060]
around shaking their boobs you know that's what happens when you take things for granted you mean

[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:29.140]
a rick and suds aren't into that i don't know what they're into they just i don't know

[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.580]
there why is that to be suspicious those two spend a lot of time together during the

[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:39.140]
joined at the hip now what were you going to say just that the phone syndrome and after

[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:43.480]
it's starting especially about three thirty four four thirty four i have to drive you to know i

[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.740]
would never do afternoon driving and i wouldn't do it for all of money well from for it would

[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:52.120]
have to be a lot more money i'll tell you that because i don't like it i hate it and when you get

[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.720]
into that period of time your time they're going to have to get used to that four thirty to six

[00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:01.680]
boy people don't have a lot of time to hang on no that was the thing that made me at zeta is that

[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:05.820]
people would hold on in the morning yeah but of course that most of our people were like dead

[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:10.920]
beat but you didn't do you didn't have traffic and news interruptions you didn't have sports stuff

[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.300]
and now that's true you basically did you're a thing without an option you had lots of

[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.700]
interruptions on say the only interrupt on we had is when boulder would come in and get all

but you would feel that you know how just couldn't control it and uh and he got involved in it you

[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:42.280]

[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.880]
the third who can't be a third great hitter but he can't feel but other than him at third which

[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:09.220]
the cubs have nobody at third and and Mcrennell's in left it's not a contest there's no content i think

[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:14.280]
the cubs and i'm not a cubs fan i'm not a cub heyder either but i think the cubs can come pretty close

[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.960]

Stan already gave us the blow-dried and credible interview I've ever seen.

[01:14:46.330 --> 01:14:48.110]
He gave us the lowdown if I can say that.

[01:14:48.130 --> 01:14:49.050]
That was amazing.

[01:14:49.190 --> 01:14:50.710]
Madonna just cut him to shred.

[01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:53.330]
Well, she didn't really cut him to shreds.

[01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:55.390]
They played with each other really.

[01:14:55.670 --> 01:14:56.090]
I don't know.

[01:14:56.370 --> 01:15:01.810]
She said if he was auditioning for her videos and had a haircut like that,

[01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:04.450]
that he'd never make it because his haircut is tired.

[01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:06.730]
That was the cleanest thing that she said on the show.

[01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:07.090]
Yes.

[01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:10.490]
She was effing with everybody and it was amazing.

[01:15:10.570 --> 01:15:10.870]
Really?

[01:15:11.850 --> 01:15:14.130]
Did you see who the next guest was?

[01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:14.570]
No.

[01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:15.990]
Himo Williams?

[01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:17.490]
Oh, God.

[01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:18.890]
No, no.

[01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:24.030]
Now to give you a good idea how good this guy is, we know the person who left we won't mention

[01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:24.690]
Alex's name.

[01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:24.970]
Yeah.

[01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:26.010]
It was one of his favorites.

[01:15:26.490 --> 01:15:26.770]
Yeah.

[01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:29.570]
Another real slime ball.

[01:15:29.770 --> 01:15:29.910]
Yeah.

[01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:33.290]
Well, luckily they only gave him about 10 minutes towards the end of the show.

[01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:36.210]
But that was one of the best interviews I've ever heard.

[01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:37.670]
Even though I don't like Garcia.

[01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.290]
Yeah.

[01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:40.210]
Are you talking about the Madonna?

[01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:40.730]
Madonna.

[01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.870]
Yeah, it was.

[01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:45.010]
I laughed several times.

[01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:45.670]
Yeah, it was filthy and disgusting.

[01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:47.330]
That's what we all want to see, of course.

[01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.790]
No, no, no.

[01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.370]
It wasn't.

[01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:48.710]
Yes.

[01:15:48.930 --> 01:15:50.430]
It wasn't a lot filthy and disgusting.

[01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:52.590]
Well, it was filthy, sir.

[01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:53.530]
Come on.

[01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:54.330]
Okay, it was.

[01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.810]
She.

[01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:55.650]
But it was good.

[01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:56.610]
It was good.

[01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:57.090]
Amen.

[01:15:57.450 --> 01:15:58.030]
See you.

[01:15:58.170 --> 01:15:58.650]
Thank you.

[01:15:58.930 --> 01:16:00.530]
Well, now we're getting to the meat of the man.

[01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:02.010]
Our last hoist's breasts real.

[01:16:02.210 --> 01:16:03.110]
That was their question.

[01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:04.810]
It was a subject last night.

[01:16:05.290 --> 01:16:06.990]
Maybe they'd listen to Howard Stern.

[01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:08.910]
Maybe our senior will be.

[01:16:09.010 --> 01:16:09.890]
Well, Madonna said no.

[01:16:10.170 --> 01:16:13.070]
Lesgie knew for sure that she knew for sure.

[01:16:13.150 --> 01:16:13.270]
Yeah.

[01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:14.990]
Best by test.

[01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:18.670]
But I like the part where Madonna said that she'd love to be spanked.

[01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:21.410]
That was so what's wrong with that?

[01:16:21.670 --> 01:16:23.250]
If you were married to that, well, of course they're both.

[01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:24.050]
That is such a pur...

[01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:24.950]
Is she still married to him?

[01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.370]
No.

[01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:26.990]
She's dating Warren Beatty.

[01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.150]
Oh, man.

[01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:28.270]
They're just talking about Warren.

[01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:31.530]
She was talking about Warren Beatty in bed last night.

[01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:33.070]
Can we talk about the thing?

[01:16:51.930 --> 01:16:56.530]
Hello,

[01:16:58.510 --> 01:17:03.050]
Linda?

[01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.050]

[01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.050]

[01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.050]

[01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.050]

[01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.050]

[01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.050]

[01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.050]

[01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.050]

[01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.050]

[01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.050]

[01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.050]

[01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.050]

[01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.050]

[01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:29.210]
I'm going to be a little bit more

[01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:29.210]

[01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:29.210]

[01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:29.210]

[01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:29.210]

[01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:29.350]
I'm going to be a little bit more

[01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.350]

[01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.390]
I'm going to be a little bit more

[01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:32.450]
I'm going to be a little bit more

[01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:35.490]
I'm going to be a little bit more

[01:17:35.490 --> 01:17:35.950]
I'm going to be a little bit more

[01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:41.690]
Maybe if they do that they'll just throw it away

[01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:45.470]
I'm going to be a little bit more

[01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:48.090]
I'm very strong

[01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:51.270]
So Warren Vady has a big what?

[01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:52.350]
Bank account?

[01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:54.450]
1217 at WIOD

[01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:58.230]
And let's take a call in Miami if we must. Hello!

[01:17:58.530 --> 01:17:59.450]
How you doing?

[01:17:59.610 --> 01:18:00.450]
Where is Diaz?

[01:18:01.090 --> 01:18:04.930]
Did you know that Burton Tommy came out with a new album recently?

[01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:05.470]
No

[01:18:05.970 --> 01:18:08.090]
Yeah, it's a Canadian release

[01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:12.370]
I don't have the address with me but there's a place where you can buy it

[01:18:12.370 --> 01:18:13.190]
So I don't know if you want to buy it

[01:18:13.190 --> 01:18:15.150]
Well probably Ron St. John Jr will be playing it

[01:18:15.150 --> 01:18:18.390]
Because anything to do with the guest who he's got the hundred copies of it

[01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.550]
Yeah

[01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:20.390]
Oh, that's about the record

[01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.870]
Is it good?

[01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:23.290]
I haven't heard it

[01:18:23.290 --> 01:18:25.490]
So, Burton Cummings is tremendous

[01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:26.270]
Yes he is

[01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:27.050]
Outstanding

[01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:28.590]
Okay, now

[01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:29.650]
Even if he is Canadian

[01:18:29.650 --> 01:18:31.610]
Well, you can't have everything with you

[01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:31.950]
That's right

[01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:32.610]
Thank you

[01:18:32.610 --> 01:18:34.370]
Brian Ferries not bad

[01:18:34.370 --> 01:18:36.930]
Oh jeez, here we go

[01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:38.750]
I've got sunshine

[01:18:40.290 --> 01:18:41.250]
Oh W

[01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:45.130]
Oh you can't call me

[01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:45.930]
Yeah, what the hell

[01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:49.190]
I'm sick and tired of giving WIOD's call letters on here

[01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:52.310]
Nobody knows what that is anyway

[01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.890]
That's right

[01:18:53.770 --> 01:18:54.730]
From Tunisix

[01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:57.250]
All right Jane, let's just do that little bits at a time

[01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.350]
Hollywood

[01:18:58.350 --> 01:19:00.810]
Yes, Neil, I'm glad to hear that you're back

[01:19:00.810 --> 01:19:01.410]
Thank you

[01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:03.110]
You sound like you're really mean

[01:19:03.970 --> 01:19:06.210]
It's a nice block, a nice cold attack

[01:19:06.210 --> 01:19:06.590]
Yeah

[01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.870]
Anyway

[01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:12.110]
Yes?

[01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:15.610]
Yeah, I was just tired, you know, telling you to go ahead to see you back here

[01:19:15.610 --> 01:19:16.850]
Okay, well thanks a lot

[01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:19.570]
1219 at WIOD

[01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:22.310]
Nah, come on, get serious

[01:19:22.830 --> 01:19:24.310]
We have an open line in Broward

[01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:28.010]
2524 WIOD

[01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:29.310]
Yeah, I'd like to talk to Neil

[01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:30.810]
Okay, where you're calling from?

[01:19:31.450 --> 01:19:31.710]
Neil?

[01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.390]
Yes

[01:19:33.490 --> 01:19:34.290]
How are you doing?

[01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:36.830]
Pretty good, do I catch you by a surprice?

[01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:39.290]
My God, I'd even finished dialing the number

[01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:41.230]
I know, and we're already speaking, you know that's something?

[01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:43.730]
Let me think of something to say and I'll call you back to you

[01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:45.510]
No, no, don't call back, just hold on

[01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:47.590]
Hold on, don't hang up, God

[01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:49.530]
We'd like to have the light slip, right?

[01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:50.790]
No, let's fill

[01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:52.210]
I'm back

[01:19:53.250 --> 01:19:54.550]
All right, now what's the point?

[01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:57.170]
I said we're light to have the lights lit up, right?

[01:19:57.370 --> 01:19:58.730]
And he says no, it's filled up

[01:19:59.210 --> 01:20:01.390]
That's like saying what day is it? He says three o'clock

[01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:03.270]
What kind of a response is that?

[01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:04.690]
I don't know, I'm still a little stiff

[01:20:04.690 --> 01:20:07.490]
We got every line lit here, it looks like, I mean it's frightening

[01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:10.550]
You think that the audience is actually you are winding their way back here?

[01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:13.650]
I'm still a little stiff after Rick Sanchez's call

[01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:17.370]
Well, I don't want to hear about that, I don't want you to personal

[01:20:17.370 --> 01:20:20.090]
Let me ask you, does he look a little puffy or is it my imagination?

[01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:22.650]
He is a little puffy, he could lose some weight too Rick

[01:20:22.650 --> 01:20:24.570]
Too much of the black beans and rice, you know

[01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:25.090]
Yeah

[01:20:25.090 --> 01:20:29.170]
You know, it's interesting, now this has nothing to do with him because he's a good guy

[01:20:29.170 --> 01:20:29.990]
I even know he's full of crap

[01:20:31.090 --> 01:20:35.750]
But listen to me, more, it's like Mexicans, okay?

[01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:37.030]
Yeah

[01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:40.030]
And there's all that poverty there, but the, now maybe I'm wrong

[01:20:40.030 --> 01:20:43.510]
It's just like in America with poor black ghetto neighborhoods

[01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:46.250]
There are a lot of people who are fat

[01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:48.810]
Not because they got a lot of money and they eat a lot of big meals

[01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:52.130]
But because the food that they start you know what I mean?

[01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:54.350]
Yeah, I mean, I mean, yeah

[01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:58.590]
And the more affluent, well, I think a barber Jordan was fat

[01:20:58.590 --> 01:21:04.270]
But I mean, how many prominent black people can you think of who are, you know, got some bucks?

[01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:05.090]
Who are fat?

[01:21:06.730 --> 01:21:07.710]
Not too many

[01:21:07.710 --> 01:21:08.830]
Oprah Winfrey

[01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:12.090]
Well, all right, well some days

[01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:15.870]
But seriously, and just stop and think about that

[01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:17.910]
I have no idea what I'm talking about, what does that mean?

[01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:18.510]
I don't know, maybe

[01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:23.090]
Oh no, I was thinking of Rick's hat, I was just thinking about the same with the, with Latin's, it's the same thing

[01:21:23.690 --> 01:21:26.650]
Yeah, well don't you tend to retain water when you eat starchy foods?

[01:21:26.690 --> 01:21:27.050]
Yes

[01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:28.670]
So therefore the puffiness

[01:21:28.670 --> 01:21:30.770]
I don't know, what do you have to retain water?

[01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:33.810]
What is this? Some kind of a like, dock this show, don't start

[01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:36.970]
It's a, we're so depressing and so morbid and so negative

[01:21:36.970 --> 01:21:38.950]
Don't be so negative, Phil

[01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:40.930]
Ah, where's hemp Goldberg, Ben?

[01:21:41.410 --> 01:21:44.150]
I have no idea, is he around? Where's Hank? Is he on vacation again?

[01:21:44.170 --> 01:21:46.050]
No, he's put up California at the fat farm

[01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:47.970]
He's back out there again at the airport

[01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:48.870]
No, he was back

[01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:51.050]
He's been gone three weeks

[01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:53.370]
Didn't he just say he's out of account or he was out?

[01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:53.590]
Yeah

[01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:54.450]
And he's back

[01:21:54.450 --> 01:21:56.010]
Yeah, I saw him on channel

[01:21:56.010 --> 01:21:57.570]
And has he lost him weight again?

[01:21:58.090 --> 01:21:59.750]
I don't know, he's sitting at the anchor

[01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:03.810]
The only way he loses in his wallet, he goes out there to go to Hollywood Park in Santa

[01:22:03.810 --> 01:22:05.930]
And he loses about 10,000 probably

[01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:07.710]
So he looks like two pounds lighter

[01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:10.470]
And then a week later he gets all speaking of puffy

[01:22:11.050 --> 01:22:13.290]
And I'm telling you Hank, I hope you're listening

[01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:15.290]
You're laughing but I'm serious

[01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:17.390]
There is another candidate

[01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:20.670]
For all the joke and Hank is a great guy really is for all the joke and back and forth

[01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:23.370]
But he needs to lose some weight

[01:22:23.370 --> 01:22:25.010]
He really does because he's either...

[01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:26.750]
I watch Hank eat lunch next door

[01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:29.150]
And let me tell you he can pack it away, he really can

[01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:32.150]
I don't know anybody fat who can't pack it away

[01:22:32.150 --> 01:22:33.690]
How about a whole fat rich?

[01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:36.170]
What's that fat picture for the meth? Is it Hernandez?

[01:22:36.730 --> 01:22:37.390]
Sid the kid

[01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:37.750]
Oh

[01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:39.510]
Who is really not doing too great

[01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:40.330]
What a slime

[01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:41.870]
I want about my virility

[01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:44.750]
I don't want to hear about this

[01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:45.310]
Okay

[01:22:46.410 --> 01:22:49.110]
It's like hearing about Andy Rooney's sex life

[01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:50.010]
I don't want to hear about

[01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:52.350]
Did you get an invitation to EJ's wedding?

[01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:54.010]
No, it didn't

[01:22:54.010 --> 01:22:55.490]
How about DJ's wedding?

[01:22:55.690 --> 01:22:56.950]
Because I'm beginning to hear some stories

[01:22:56.950 --> 01:23:00.010]
I heard stories about DJ long ago

[01:23:00.010 --> 01:23:01.530]
Oh, geez

[01:23:01.530 --> 01:23:03.890]
He was hanging out at the button south

[01:23:03.890 --> 01:23:07.170]
Oh, come on

[01:23:07.170 --> 01:23:10.150]
Next to be Tommy who's hanging out at Uncle Charlie's or something

[01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:11.630]
Let's cut the crap, can we?

[01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:12.550]
Cowboy Bill

[01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.830]
The Copa

[01:23:15.230 --> 01:23:17.090]
The Copa is not there anymore, okay?

[01:23:17.210 --> 01:23:18.010]
There is a plate

[01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:19.290]
It's not there

[01:23:19.290 --> 01:23:20.630]
No, 21 club

[01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:23.370]
Now wait, you're not in a green or are you talking about it?

[01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:24.970]
The Copa hasn't been there for ages

[01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:26.210]
That's a...

[01:23:26.210 --> 01:23:27.810]
Oh, not the Copa I'm thinking of Backstreet

[01:23:27.810 --> 01:23:29.530]
Well, I don't know about all those fat places

[01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:31.570]
I don't know about that, I'm thinking of Backstreet

[01:23:31.570 --> 01:23:32.370]
I hope he's there

[01:23:32.370 --> 01:23:33.470]
How do you know?

[01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:36.370]
Nick is not yet, it's out of hell to you know

[01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:39.430]
Oh, look at that, he's getting right in the face

[01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:42.030]
And when Nick gets right in the face, that's really quite an accomplishment

[01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:42.770]
Look at that

[01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:45.930]
What the hell does he know about the Copa?

[01:23:46.090 --> 01:23:46.290]
Wow

[01:23:46.290 --> 01:23:47.450]
Oh, pull back

[01:23:47.450 --> 01:23:47.990]
Hold back

[01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.670]
Hold back, hold back

[01:23:48.670 --> 01:23:51.370]
There reminisce about some of the good old days in WSNews

[01:23:51.370 --> 01:23:51.990]
Wow

[01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:55.190]
By the way, Hank and Jo will be on sports talk, it's just 05 tonight

[01:23:55.730 --> 01:23:57.230]
So we'll spice it up a little bit

[01:23:57.230 --> 01:23:59.150]
I don't want to say Jo is boring, but...

[01:23:59.150 --> 01:23:59.710]
No, he's not

[01:23:59.710 --> 01:24:01.270]
Jo's okay, he's just...

[01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:02.210]
Why do we pick on Jo?

[01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:06.230]
He's one of those people who's convenient, he's in easy target, okay?

[01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.310]
And it's terrible that we keep doing it

[01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:10.390]
I miss him and Manage together though

[01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:11.730]
Have a nice day

[01:24:11.730 --> 01:24:12.190]
Got that

[01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:15.310]
23 past noon at WIOD

[01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:17.070]
Did I say Backstreet?

[01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:18.510]
It's all the same, it's all the same

[01:24:18.510 --> 01:24:21.030]
No, Backstreet hasn't been there for a long time

[01:24:21.610 --> 01:24:23.250]
And it's that restaurant

[01:24:23.250 --> 01:24:25.750]
What the hell is that Mexican restaurant?

[01:24:26.810 --> 01:24:28.970]
It's in there now, it used to be one of Steve's sponsors

[01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:32.310]
Oh, come on, the Lanier Pcajian house

[01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:34.950]
It's not Mexican, but the Lanier Pcajian house isn't that there?

[01:24:35.850 --> 01:24:38.450]
Custief took me there with Norm Kent one night because it was free

[01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:43.310]
Okay, 24 past noon, we have an open line in Dade County at 751

[01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:44.970]
You think he's getting any freebies in New York?

[01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:47.050]
Boy, he's giving free autographs, I know that

[01:24:47.050 --> 01:24:48.950]
At the baseball card shows, we'll be right back

[01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:53.430]
Here's what you'll mind of Miss yesterday afternoon with Rick and Suds

[01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:55.710]
Would you at least play one song?

[01:24:56.190 --> 01:24:56.370]
What?

[01:24:56.950 --> 01:25:01.410]
It says for Christ's sake, every time it's just listening to folk art

[01:25:01.410 --> 01:25:07.590]
I'm being Miami-broward, I don't know, at least one song, gee

[01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:13.930]
Nice job

[01:25:13.930 --> 01:25:15.890]
I way got it

[01:25:16.410 --> 01:25:18.430]
She was great

[01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:24.690]
Okay Vanessa, you're crying a little snippling wimp

[01:25:24.690 --> 01:25:26.370]
Take that seatbelt off

[01:25:26.370 --> 01:25:26.930]
Yeah, take it

[01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:29.650]
Join Rick and Suds, this afternoon at two

[01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:32.890]
A News Talk Radio 610 WIOD

[01:25:32.890 --> 01:25:38.390]
Sometimes I feel that life is passing me by

[01:25:41.490 --> 01:25:46.710]
Sometimes I feel that people don't want to smile

[01:25:48.690 --> 01:25:53.570]
Anyways, 1228 at WIOD, one thing, mark in the dark in West Palm Beach

[01:25:53.570 --> 01:26:01.330]
Who sent me baseball analysis and reporting and scouting and all this other for both leagues

[01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:05.070]
American and national league and I guess I can analyze all the players and all the teams now

[01:26:05.710 --> 01:26:08.270]
Thank you very much Mark, whatever this stuff is

[01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:11.810]
28 past noon at WIOD, blow fly

[01:26:12.570 --> 01:26:13.670]
Yep, high Neil

[01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:14.750]
The real one?

[01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:15.930]
The real one

[01:26:15.930 --> 01:26:17.250]
I'll be God's friend

[01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:21.130]
I'll be the real one when you was out and they wouldn't tell me what the trouble was

[01:26:21.130 --> 01:26:23.190]
Well, they told everybody I left town

[01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:30.010]
Right in the way glad to hear you voice again, I just got back in town from doing a movie called The Twisted World of Blowfly

[01:26:30.010 --> 01:26:30.710]
Really?

[01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:34.030]
Yeah, I sure wish we could play your records on here like the good old days

[01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:38.250]
But you know, we got all these fancious pigs out there watching our uptight

[01:26:38.250 --> 01:26:40.790]
I just finished an album and I like it in one more song

[01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:47.170]
And I want to do one call Radio vs. TV or whatever, whatever you want to call it

[01:26:47.170 --> 01:26:50.470]
And I want you to put something together for me and I got a track and I put it to music

[01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:51.270]
Okay

[01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:57.950]
Yeah, just don't have to just don't have to land just right to choose or whatever you think from way back up and now

[01:26:59.070 --> 01:27:03.090]
And now just don't know we can use names in another than yours

[01:27:03.090 --> 01:27:04.150]
No, sure we can

[01:27:04.150 --> 01:27:06.690]
Okay, all right, put it in there, we need to look over this anyway

[01:27:06.690 --> 01:27:07.370]
Okay

[01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:12.270]
And we'll do it part, wrap and part vocals and I'll be calling you back when you put something together

[01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:15.570]
Great, and probably you get abandoned for Lauderdale

[01:27:15.570 --> 01:27:15.930]
Right

[01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:19.470]
Okay, blow fly good here from here, take care of yourself

[01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:20.270]
Do it in the face

[01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:21.270]
Okay, all right, bye bye

[01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:22.350]
Bye, what a guy

[01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:24.090]
Those were the days, huh?

[01:27:24.650 --> 01:27:25.690]
When we had an audience

[01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:31.110]
Well, hey listen, I can't help it, I mean now everything has to be oh yes sir, no sir

[01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:34.090]
I mean we live in a fancious country and the people in the country are too stupid

[01:27:34.090 --> 01:27:37.970]
But there he goes, being negative again, he's being negative, we don't want to hear that

[01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:40.510]
We already know the world has screwed up, we want to escape

[01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:44.910]
We want to escape, we want to see Madonna rubber thing against our sinews ahead

[01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:46.950]
That's it, that's what it's all about

[01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:49.890]
God, what a thought, it's that's Pat Sayjac, Miami

[01:27:50.410 --> 01:27:51.350]
Stand your boy

[01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:54.430]
Okay, well I think we got the message the first time pal

[01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:57.430]
But if it's so boring how come you're still there and you keep calling back

[01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:59.710]
Stick your fingers somewhere else beside the phone, okay?

[01:28:00.010 --> 01:28:01.210]
Might be a big improvement

[01:28:02.430 --> 01:28:05.690]
751 putts in Dade County, we have an opening there, also Boken Pambi

[01:28:05.690 --> 01:28:08.210]
To open up again like the Dead Sea, or is it the Red Sea?

[01:28:09.170 --> 01:28:09.590]
The Red Sea?

[01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.210]
Whatever

[01:28:10.630 --> 01:28:11.230]
I see

[01:28:11.850 --> 01:28:12.530]
Water Hill

[01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:15.110]
Is Water Hill gone?

[01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:18.970]
See this was all, these were phony baloney, you know, you gave us a false sense of security

[01:28:18.970 --> 01:28:20.610]
I told you, I have to know where they all go

[01:28:20.610 --> 01:28:24.750]
Yeah, I just told you that, right, and then half of Mark Crank's anyway, a Fort Lauderdale

[01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.470]
Yeah

[01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:26.370]
Yeah

[01:28:26.370 --> 01:28:29.390]
How long was that break a minute ago, it seemed like about seven minutes

[01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:30.890]
How long was it?

[01:28:31.050 --> 01:28:32.470]
Yeah, do we invent the seven minute break?

[01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:36.290]
Three and a half, it says here, I wasn't paying any attention, I was opening this thing

[01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:38.330]
Got it seem longer than the four minute one yesterday

[01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:41.850]
Well, we're working on about a 20 minute break, that's why we've included the program

[01:28:41.850 --> 01:28:44.890]
All grid radio, just all spots

[01:28:44.890 --> 01:28:47.830]
My boss wants to know when the news is, I can go back to work

[01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:50.190]
One o'clock, half hour time

[01:28:50.190 --> 01:28:51.190]
I got to hold on that long?

[01:28:51.330 --> 01:28:51.610]
Yes

[01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:55.610]
Oh well, put me back on hold then

[01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:56.490]
Hold on tight

[01:28:57.250 --> 01:28:59.950]
1231 and WIOD, Broward, Boken Pambi

[01:28:59.950 --> 01:29:03.530]
Three open lines here, it's glaring, we're still not hearing from those embarrassing people

[01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:05.810]
I guess they're gone, they're gone forever

[01:29:05.810 --> 01:29:08.870]
See what I mean, fickle, fickle town, WIOD

[01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:10.090]
Yeah, hi, is this Marvin?

[01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:10.610]
Yes

[01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:12.390]
Kathy Livingston, hi Kathy

[01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:13.830]
How are you? Good

[01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:15.150]
Can I just talk to Neil Briefly?

[01:29:15.290 --> 01:29:16.330]
Sure, hold on a second, Kathy

[01:29:17.190 --> 01:29:20.690]
Okay, we have a Boken, now we got Broward filled up, there are 278 knots

[01:29:20.690 --> 01:29:22.310]
Oh, we got the knots landing for you

[01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:25.870]
Okay, now get that other one out of my life, I got no one here there

[01:29:26.210 --> 01:29:28.370]
Here's that crap, let's talk about Paige

[01:29:28.890 --> 01:29:29.210]
Yeah

[01:29:33.010 --> 01:29:36.670]
The knots landing, ladies, better get a very high for a few, here's this

[01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.690]
So, well Lord

[01:29:41.370 --> 01:29:42.830]
Look at that, we just lost the call

[01:29:43.690 --> 01:29:47.630]
I don't want LA law, put that away, Rob, you're I don't want to even see the cards

[01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:51.590]
Thank you, Roger, get that thing out of here

[01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:56.910]
Okay, there's William and Devane playing Jack Nicholson playing the Joker, did you see Batman?

[01:29:57.250 --> 01:29:58.990]
It's a good show last, horrible movie

[01:29:58.990 --> 01:30:01.410]
It was a good show last week, horrible movie

[01:30:01.410 --> 01:30:02.770]
But there I go being negative again

[01:30:03.330 --> 01:30:07.250]
It's a, by the way, I have a theory about one aspect of them

[01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.390]
WIOD

[01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:09.570]
Hello

[01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.410]
Hi

[01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:12.350]
Hello

[01:30:13.110 --> 01:30:13.630]
Hello

[01:30:13.630 --> 01:30:14.370]
Hi

[01:30:14.370 --> 01:30:15.570]
Hi, I can barely hear you

[01:30:15.570 --> 01:30:16.750]
Well, I can hear you

[01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:16.910]
Yes

[01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:20.610]
It's good, I just want to tell you to stand high

[01:30:20.610 --> 01:30:24.510]
And I hope there's a chance that he'll come back in afternoon

[01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:27.670]
Oh, don't start this up again, please, please

[01:30:27.670 --> 01:30:30.450]
No, I don't want to eat it, let's stop all of that

[01:30:30.450 --> 01:30:32.010]
I'm not a field if in morning

[01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:33.510]
He won't take it again

[01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:36.390]
Oh God, stop, stop, stop

[01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:38.590]
Stop, stop, stop

[01:30:38.590 --> 01:30:43.310]
Got the crap, this station is like drowning from all this bickering and infighting

[01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:48.630]
And you know, it used to be fun, it's not fun anymore, it's like a disease here, it's got to stop

[01:30:48.630 --> 01:30:49.350]
Well, that's the point we want

[01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:53.290]
We can't change our lineup like you change your underwear, we just can't do it

[01:30:53.290 --> 01:30:54.790]
Let's bash the Yankees, though

[01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:56.310]
Exactly, rip the Yankees

[01:30:56.810 --> 01:31:01.650]
Anyway, well, we can't get stand back or so and else I guess we just have to look forward to you

[01:31:01.650 --> 01:31:03.970]
And not landing, that's about all there is in this town

[01:31:03.970 --> 01:31:05.390]
Oh, you like not landing?

[01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:06.270]
I love it

[01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:12.290]
Hey, I have a theory, you know, the security guy that's stalking Michelle

[01:31:12.290 --> 01:31:13.050]
Uh-huh

[01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:19.270]
He is not the one, it's the TV producer that's doing all the naughty stuff

[01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:20.070]
Oh, you're kidding

[01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:21.290]
No, I'm not kidding you

[01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:21.750]
Why?

[01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:24.550]
The security guy is going to be, he's going to turn out to save her life

[01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:27.970]
How do you like that? Well, we'll just have to all wait and see

[01:31:27.970 --> 01:31:28.490]
Okay

[01:31:28.490 --> 01:31:30.330]
That'll be our cliffhanger for the season

[01:31:30.330 --> 01:31:30.950]
That's it

[01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:33.390]
You sure it's not the producer, the woman, the big one

[01:31:33.390 --> 01:31:35.270]
It is, she's behind it all

[01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:36.330]
I thought you meant the guy

[01:31:36.330 --> 01:31:37.810]
No, she's behind it all

[01:31:37.810 --> 01:31:40.870]
Well, that would be too obvious because that's what they're trying to make it look like

[01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:41.610]
I don't know

[01:31:41.610 --> 01:31:44.050]
Well, anyway, I got to go, there's my exit

[01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:46.610]
Okay, have a happy day

[01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:47.470]
Thank you

[01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:52.650]
1234, you're happiness station, WIOD, where everybody is so damn happy, it's almost sickening

[01:31:52.650 --> 01:31:54.030]
Look at that, they're chowning the fan

[01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:56.970]
Or are these people running there for like 10 seconds and they go off?

[01:31:57.610 --> 01:31:57.850]
Chowning the fan

[01:31:57.850 --> 01:32:02.730]
Is there something new that's happening between noon and one like a life that's going on in this town?

[01:32:02.730 --> 01:32:05.250]
Because I don't know if it would never had like this in the noon hour

[01:32:05.250 --> 01:32:06.850]
We used to have it for all four hours

[01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:07.950]
It's that guy on Zeta

[01:32:07.950 --> 01:32:09.070]
Oh, WIOD

[01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:11.490]
Hi, could I speak with Neil?

[01:32:11.570 --> 01:32:14.730]
Sure, hold on a second, WIOD, hello, goodbye

[01:32:16.450 --> 01:32:20.230]
That must have been a big start picking up WPB arm, making those calls again

[01:32:20.230 --> 01:32:25.110]
A 524 WIOD in the Broward and 278 Puts in Boca

[01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:27.990]
Rick and Puts will be along at two, they got open phones today tomorrow

[01:32:28.770 --> 01:32:32.890]
They have the World Federation wrestling douche bags or whatever the hell that is

[01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:35.470]
And they've got, what is it?

[01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:39.490]
You already took it off, if you're a macho king, Randy Savage will be on

[01:32:39.490 --> 01:32:44.470]
For some of those real macho guys that we heard from earlier and also for some of you silly savages in the audience

[01:32:45.010 --> 01:32:45.410]
WIOD

[01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:49.930]
Hold on, and we have two open lines in Broward

[01:32:49.930 --> 01:32:52.170]
I'm really pumping these numbers today just to make a point

[01:32:52.170 --> 01:32:53.610]
I don't know what the point is but it's fun

[01:32:54.710 --> 01:32:56.190]
524 WIOD, Palm Beach

[01:32:56.190 --> 01:32:58.450]
Hey Neil, it's a nice landing lady

[01:32:58.450 --> 01:32:59.710]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:32:59.730 --> 01:33:01.790]
I told you we didn't inspire you with that music, right?

[01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:02.290]
I know it

[01:33:02.730 --> 01:33:05.230]
What the hell is going on there? Are you in Rosa's house?

[01:33:05.370 --> 01:33:06.030]
I'll tell you

[01:33:07.190 --> 01:33:09.630]
You know what I think you're right, I agree with you

[01:33:09.630 --> 01:33:11.690]
That it's the guy producer, it's not the guy

[01:33:11.690 --> 01:33:14.390]
No, I didn't say it was, I thought that's what Stan was talking about

[01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:15.450]
No, that's what I think it is

[01:33:15.450 --> 01:33:15.670]
Do you?

[01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:16.210]
Yeah

[01:33:17.010 --> 01:33:20.270]
Because he's coming on like he's Karen's good buddy and best friend

[01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:22.110]
And I think he's like trying to get her into the second

[01:33:24.110 --> 01:33:25.070]
He's trying to what?

[01:33:26.670 --> 01:33:29.470]
He's trying to be your good buddy but he's going to end up being not tonight

[01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:32.630]
Yeah, well he's a little bizarre anyway so it's possible

[01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:35.910]
He's not normal like most of the people on that show

[01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:36.630]
Like Val

[01:33:36.630 --> 01:33:37.990]
Like Val, normal like Val

[01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.970]
I love Val

[01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:40.010]
Please

[01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:42.290]
Do you hear the bad news about Valvo?

[01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.630]
What?

[01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:45.230]
Do you like that rated the worst character ever?

[01:33:45.610 --> 01:33:47.550]
I don't care, she's beautiful

[01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:50.170]
Now now there is depressing and negative

[01:33:50.170 --> 01:33:51.690]
I mean there is really a difference

[01:33:51.690 --> 01:33:53.090]
She's getting back with Gary and everything

[01:33:53.090 --> 01:33:54.670]
Oh please, really?

[01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:57.550]
Nothing is ever fine with her, okay?

[01:33:58.570 --> 01:34:04.070]
And then did you hear that the her ex-husband that disappeared was now a auto-race driver

[01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:08.610]
Or some damn thing was in that list of in people magazine of the 50 most beautiful people in the world?

[01:34:08.610 --> 01:34:08.930]
No

[01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:10.370]
You're kidding

[01:34:10.370 --> 01:34:11.570]
What was his name?

[01:34:12.570 --> 01:34:13.230]
Um, Ben

[01:34:13.230 --> 01:34:14.110]
Ben

[01:34:14.110 --> 01:34:14.650]
What was it? Ben?

[01:34:15.190 --> 01:34:16.190]
Yeah, how's he Ben?

[01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:19.930]
He's been better than Danny

[01:34:19.930 --> 01:34:23.010]
I'll tell you one thing if he's one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world

[01:34:23.010 --> 01:34:24.290]
There is hope for anybody

[01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:25.970]
Even Howard Stern

[01:34:25.970 --> 01:34:27.610]
Even Howard Stern, yeah, Paige was in there

[01:34:27.610 --> 01:34:29.450]
Paige was in Nicolai Sheridan was in there, yeah

[01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:31.310]
Pat Peterson didn't make it though

[01:34:31.930 --> 01:34:33.370]
Does that tell you everything you need to know?

[01:34:33.450 --> 01:34:34.750]
Yeah, but Sandberg was there

[01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:36.690]
Yeah, which also he didn't belong there

[01:34:36.690 --> 01:34:38.550]
He had a real good, that was a real good thing

[01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:40.770]
That was a very flattering picture of him too by the way

[01:34:40.770 --> 01:34:43.170]
By the way yesterday somebody asked it's not 90 something

[01:34:43.170 --> 01:34:46.170]
Yesterday was I think 109 games in a row without an error

[01:34:46.690 --> 01:34:50.390]
And he's also consecutive chances broken that record by you at Peterson

[01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:53.710]
Pat Peterson, Sandberg is not doing too bad either

[01:34:53.710 --> 01:34:55.370]
Sandberg is right on his tail

[01:34:55.770 --> 01:34:56.550]
So does Steve

[01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:57.590]
He never had it there, has he?

[01:34:58.730 --> 01:35:00.290]
Boy, I'm not getting it

[01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:03.770]
Well anyway, looks like this week Michael and Linda are going to do something

[01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:05.010]
Yeah, I think this week tomorrow will be really good

[01:35:05.010 --> 01:35:06.690]
Maybe a kiss on the cheek

[01:35:06.690 --> 01:35:07.890]
You know, he starts very slow

[01:35:07.890 --> 01:35:09.870]
He don't want to just jump right into anything

[01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:12.310]
I'm like last year when he and Paige were really getting into it

[01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:13.670]
That's when it was good

[01:35:13.670 --> 01:35:15.270]
It was good, it was good

[01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:16.530]
It was good, two beautiful people

[01:35:16.530 --> 01:35:17.030]
Man

[01:35:18.970 --> 01:35:20.870]
So Stan, you got a satellite dish?

[01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.970]
How are you going to watch it tomorrow?

[01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:24.250]
What do you mean? I have cable

[01:35:24.250 --> 01:35:25.670]
I thought you were working

[01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:28.110]
No, Laurie tapes the cheek

[01:35:28.110 --> 01:35:30.230]
She doesn't watch it, we watch it when I get home

[01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:31.110]
Oh, okay

[01:35:31.670 --> 01:35:34.490]
She doesn't watch it, she tapes it, that's a real dedicated wife for you

[01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:35.070]
Absolutely

[01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:37.150]
Or she's life to you and watches it anyway

[01:35:37.150 --> 01:35:39.030]
And I think there comes have the day off tomorrow

[01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:43.030]
So I have to worry about any game because they're coming home to play the podraise and the braves

[01:35:43.670 --> 01:35:45.690]
Wow, am I looking forward to those braves

[01:35:45.690 --> 01:35:47.590]
Well, I'm looking forward to my satellite dish

[01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:49.370]
Good, are you really getting one?

[01:35:49.450 --> 01:35:50.350]
Yeah, I'm really getting one

[01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:53.130]
Great, well listen, I finally tracked down

[01:35:53.130 --> 01:35:56.770]
Remember all those calls we had a few months ago about the alleged feed?

[01:35:57.130 --> 01:35:57.310]
Yes

[01:35:57.310 --> 01:36:06.570]
Well, it comes over on Tuesday night, Wednesday morning at 3.50 am on the Canadian satellite, Anik 1 on Channel 4

[01:36:06.570 --> 01:36:07.730]
Have you ever taped it?

[01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:10.910]
No, because I just discovered that while I was sitting at home with nothing to do

[01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:14.690]
There's a couple of weeks I was scouring through the satellite guide

[01:36:14.690 --> 01:36:14.990]
Right

[01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:18.070]
And it comes through, I know nothing about it coming through at 9 o'clock at the night

[01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:20.370]
It does, it's not listed anywhere and I can't find it

[01:36:20.370 --> 01:36:22.170]
But a three, so if you just set your machine

[01:36:22.170 --> 01:36:22.630]
Right

[01:36:23.070 --> 01:36:25.870]
You can get the new episode of the day before anybody else does

[01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:26.850]
That sounds different

[01:36:26.850 --> 01:36:27.750]
And then call Neil

[01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:28.590]
That's right

[01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:29.510]
Say whether it's worth watching

[01:36:29.890 --> 01:36:31.930]
Call Neil and tell him all about it

[01:36:31.930 --> 01:36:32.330]
That's right

[01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:33.090]
For him

[01:36:33.090 --> 01:36:33.850]
For everybody

[01:36:35.810 --> 01:36:36.790]
That sounds good

[01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:37.370]
Okay

[01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:39.210]
So maybe next week I'll be able to do that

[01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:39.830]
Please

[01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:40.470]
Okay

[01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:42.030]
All right, we'll talk to you later

[01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:45.550]
1243 at WIOD, the Nots Landing Boy

[01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:46.550]
Yes, Neil

[01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:47.270]
Yes, sir

[01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.710]
How you doing?

[01:36:47.890 --> 01:36:48.190]
Okay

[01:36:48.190 --> 01:36:53.190]
I agree, I think it's the female producer that's trying to put it over on Karen

[01:36:53.190 --> 01:36:54.810]
Oh, but that would be too obvious

[01:36:54.810 --> 01:36:56.110]
Well, what do you expect?

[01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:56.870]
Yeah

[01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:58.390]
I was just at Hollywood

[01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.950]
Yeah

[01:36:59.530 --> 01:37:02.810]
I was watching that, I was up the last one, I guess it was about two in the morning

[01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:04.650]
And at Channel 39 here

[01:37:04.650 --> 01:37:07.750]
They were showing really old episodes of Matt's Landing

[01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:11.730]
Where they're like Karen's wearing like Dull Bottom jeans

[01:37:12.230 --> 01:37:13.690]
And Gary was an alcoholic

[01:37:13.690 --> 01:37:14.890]
Are you cereal?

[01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:15.450]
Yeah, that's right

[01:37:15.450 --> 01:37:16.430]
What time was this?

[01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:17.870]
I think it was about two in the morning

[01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:19.170]
Two were two thirty

[01:37:19.170 --> 01:37:22.950]
I remember when they were showing in the daytime about 11 in the morning

[01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:24.510]
I don't remember what the channel was

[01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:26.810]
And they were showing all those episodes from about five years ago

[01:37:26.810 --> 01:37:29.150]
Boy, that was some interesting stuff

[01:37:29.150 --> 01:37:32.130]
It is interesting, it's interesting to see how all these things are developed

[01:37:32.130 --> 01:37:33.030]
And what happened?

[01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:34.050]
There were a lot of things developing

[01:37:34.050 --> 01:37:35.810]
Belize on Sad Feeterson was 11

[01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:38.770]
He was not 11, he was about 18

[01:37:39.870 --> 01:37:41.730]
Barely legal, but that's okay

[01:37:41.730 --> 01:37:44.450]
And this one, Gary was an alcoholic

[01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:46.210]
He was just drinking...

[01:37:46.210 --> 01:37:48.210]
Hey, listen, if Mr. Watts' name they used to be here

[01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:50.350]
And watch 12-year-old Twinkies on Dance Party

[01:37:50.350 --> 01:37:51.810]
I can...

[01:37:53.010 --> 01:37:54.610]
God, talk about desperate

[01:37:54.610 --> 01:37:56.110]
So it was pretty interesting

[01:37:56.110 --> 01:38:00.550]
And Gary was with Abby, Donna Mills

[01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:02.050]
She was just...

[01:38:02.050 --> 01:38:03.910]
Well, they ran out of Vaseline for the lens

[01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:06.750]
They couldn't use that filter anymore, it was just custom-today much

[01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:07.790]
They had to get her off the show

[01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:08.750]
And so they did

[01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:10.070]
I always stayed bring her back, you know

[01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.670]
She was...

[01:38:10.670 --> 01:38:13.150]
She had a certain element, you know, like hostility

[01:38:13.150 --> 01:38:14.750]
I thought they were going to portray Olivia

[01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:18.130]
To be in her mold, but...

[01:38:18.130 --> 01:38:20.570]
By the way, now whatever happened, she came to Miami

[01:38:20.570 --> 01:38:22.630]
I bet if we conducted a search we could find Olivia

[01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:23.890]
And what's his name?

[01:38:24.290 --> 01:38:24.450]
Harold...

[01:38:24.450 --> 01:38:25.110]
Harold was...

[01:38:25.950 --> 01:38:27.450]
I bet you we could find them

[01:38:27.450 --> 01:38:29.250]
I think I saw him on the turnplay class, right, too

[01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:32.430]
Yeah, they could like double date with Sean and Madonna

[01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:34.370]
They're both a couple of slime bags

[01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:37.390]
Who look like they haven't bade in about ten years, especially Harold

[01:38:37.930 --> 01:38:39.550]
And maybe they'll run into Nadia

[01:38:39.550 --> 01:38:40.330]
Her boyfriend

[01:38:40.330 --> 01:38:41.190]
Nadia

[01:38:41.190 --> 01:38:41.630]
Yeah

[01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:44.310]
Okay, Neil Stanley, talk to me both

[01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:45.110]
Thanks for the bambry

[01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:45.870]
Okay, take care

[01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:48.390]
1245 at W-I-O-D

[01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:50.370]
I didn't know that was the case

[01:38:50.370 --> 01:38:52.290]
Aren't you, I feel very negative in depressing

[01:38:52.290 --> 01:38:54.330]
Oh, after the not-slanding thing?

[01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:55.430]
No, just in general

[01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.710]
Oh

[01:38:55.710 --> 01:38:59.470]
A 524 downer in Dade County in the Broward

[01:38:59.470 --> 01:39:01.690]
And 655 W-I-O-D in Palm Beach

[01:39:01.690 --> 01:39:05.010]
Now, come on, we know you people on Palm Beach are mostly listening to lead followers show

[01:39:05.010 --> 01:39:06.270]
What's he doing today?

[01:39:06.630 --> 01:39:08.230]
Coca-Cola, are you drinking it?

[01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:08.890]
I haven't any idea

[01:39:08.890 --> 01:39:10.530]
Is Mike Miller still on that station?

[01:39:10.690 --> 01:39:11.550]
Has anybody known?

[01:39:11.710 --> 01:39:12.330]
Gilbert would know

[01:39:12.330 --> 01:39:14.570]
Come on, Gilbert, call up Nick and let him know

[01:39:14.570 --> 01:39:17.590]
He's a Mike Miller call Gary Bruce and try to get me fired by the way

[01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:18.110]
For what?

[01:39:18.650 --> 01:39:19.790]
Because he wants to put him on the air?

[01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:20.670]
Yeah, because he wants to put him on the air

[01:39:20.670 --> 01:39:21.890]
I'll screw you, Gilbert, okay?

[01:39:22.170 --> 01:39:25.030]
You're getting chronic and you're a pain in the ass, but we love you, Gilbert

[01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:27.070]
Well, speaking of that, what happened to that card?

[01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:31.350]
Man, oh man, if I go through the whole day today and I don't play that now

[01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:33.130]
Don't tell me that that card's gone

[01:39:34.090 --> 01:39:35.630]
That would frost my picture

[01:39:35.630 --> 01:39:36.590]
You're looking to it

[01:39:37.130 --> 01:39:38.930]
Oh, yeah, Gilbert's stuff is down there

[01:39:38.930 --> 01:39:43.930]
The Q-A-M Gilbert thing that they were kind enough to send me a virgin copy of

[01:39:43.930 --> 01:39:47.130]
That I played yesterday for the first time the real clear good copy

[01:39:47.130 --> 01:39:52.070]
By the way, the Stan Major nighttime extravaganza will be on the air tomorrow

[01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:53.090]
They don't care

[01:39:53.090 --> 01:39:54.750]
Yeah, they want to know when we're going to be

[01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:57.170]
Um, or one time shot this week

[01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:59.030]
What did they tell us that card?

[01:39:59.030 --> 01:40:04.590]
Now I'm going to look around forward and if it's not here, boy, Rick and Puts are going to have some real explaining to do, okay?

[01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:07.030]
Because they got their fingers into everything

[01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:11.410]
I told him play anything you want, but I think when they start, if they're going to start playing neo-rodules disease

[01:40:11.410 --> 01:40:12.970]
It'll be a little bit too much, you know?

[01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:17.870]
I don't want them to start getting like you and playing all of my material

[01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:19.890]
I don't want them to start getting like you and playing all of your material

[01:40:19.890 --> 01:40:21.170]
I have never played a regular thing

[01:40:21.170 --> 01:40:24.170]
Collar reports Mike Miller is still on WJ at ONE

[01:40:24.170 --> 01:40:25.830]
And he's always boring as when he said in his chair

[01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:27.690]
No wonder it feels a little squeaky, Miami

[01:40:27.690 --> 01:40:30.010]
Driving home to music

[01:40:30.010 --> 01:40:32.290]
Driving home to music

[01:40:32.290 --> 01:40:34.470]
Driving home to sports

[01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:37.530]
And weather all the different views

[01:40:37.530 --> 01:40:39.410]
Driving home to music

[01:40:40.170 --> 01:40:42.210]
Driving home to news

[01:40:42.210 --> 01:40:44.730]
Driving home to sports

[01:40:44.730 --> 01:40:47.490]
And weather all the different views

[01:40:47.490 --> 01:40:54.150]
Shot, shot, shot

[01:40:55.670 --> 01:40:57.110]
Driving home to music

[01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.830]
Driving home to music

[01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:03.210]
Driving home to music

[01:41:03.670 --> 01:41:04.070]
Driving home to music

[01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:05.150]
Driving home to music

[01:41:07.630 --> 01:41:08.030]
WIOD

[01:41:09.130 --> 01:41:10.970]
Thank you Mike, okay that was Mike Disney

[01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:12.270]
1248

[01:41:12.710 --> 01:41:15.010]
What are you laughing about? He's very big into that card

[01:41:15.490 --> 01:41:17.130]
Okay, let's do a little spot here

[01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:19.230]
And then during the rest of the break I'll scour

[01:41:19.230 --> 01:41:21.190]
Or I'll do my damnedest to find a Gilbert thing

[01:41:21.190 --> 01:41:23.730]
Or if that disappeared we are all I still have the cassette

[01:41:23.730 --> 01:41:25.430]
But I'd hate to have to dub it all over again

[01:41:26.130 --> 01:41:29.730]
I don't like dubbing off cassette because it's not precise

[01:41:29.730 --> 01:41:31.430]
You know, so you're absolutely right

[01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:32.830]
Anyway, I always do it

[01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:35.490]
As I started to say, okay I'm torn between

[01:41:35.490 --> 01:41:37.270]
I don't know because we're almost at the end of the hour

[01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:39.830]
And if I played the Gilbert thing that's got to run about two minutes right?

[01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:45.370]
Kathy is gone. How do you like that?

[01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:46.350]
WIOD

[01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:47.690]
Home for Neil

[01:41:48.230 --> 01:41:49.210]
You're holding for me?

[01:41:49.650 --> 01:41:49.970]
For you?

[01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:51.670]
Okay, hold on a second WIOD

[01:41:52.050 --> 01:41:52.770]
How you doing?

[01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:53.970]
Hold on a second, okay?

[01:41:54.330 --> 01:41:55.030]
Don't go away

[01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:56.550]
Now you were doing what?

[01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:58.270]
Sir?

[01:41:58.990 --> 01:41:59.230]
Neil?

[01:41:59.450 --> 01:41:59.630]
Yes

[01:41:59.630 --> 01:42:01.210]
I'm sorry, I'm getting a little mixed up here

[01:42:01.210 --> 01:42:02.170]
I know that's your idea man

[01:42:02.170 --> 01:42:03.930]
I look to keep everybody on their toes

[01:42:03.930 --> 01:42:06.530]
I'm in my office, I don't have a radio I just wanted to give you a call

[01:42:06.530 --> 01:42:07.910]
Great, how you doing?

[01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:09.150]
Good! What you doing?

[01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.810]
You feeling better?

[01:42:09.930 --> 01:42:10.410]
Who you doing?

[01:42:10.810 --> 01:42:11.990]
I'm feeling pretty good today

[01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:15.510]
Slowly but surely every I'd say that about 83% the healed

[01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:16.790]
83% huh?

[01:42:16.890 --> 01:42:19.030]
I'm gonna go see Ernest Angel and see if he can heal the rest

[01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:21.690]
Hey you're in the hospital with a friend of mine's father

[01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:22.830]
Herb

[01:42:22.830 --> 01:42:23.710]
Herb jock

[01:42:23.710 --> 01:42:25.830]
Great guy, I got his number I got to give him a call

[01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:26.750]
I got his number at home

[01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:29.230]
He had more laughs in those three days

[01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:30.910]
It was just a constant laughter

[01:42:31.690 --> 01:42:32.570]
He's a great guy

[01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:33.970]
I want this school with his son Michael

[01:42:33.970 --> 01:42:34.510]
Did you get a chance?

[01:42:34.590 --> 01:42:35.630]
Yeah, I met the whole family

[01:42:35.630 --> 01:42:37.550]
He's got a great family, they're all super people

[01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:39.770]
I'm serious, we had more fun laughing

[01:42:39.770 --> 01:42:40.890]
I don't know about what though

[01:42:40.890 --> 01:42:42.370]
Just you got a laugh when you're in the hospital

[01:42:42.370 --> 01:42:43.370]
You're gonna cry, you know?

[01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:45.750]
And he's just a fun guy, he's a super guy

[01:42:46.170 --> 01:42:46.490]
Yeah

[01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:48.210]
All right, can you just put me on a whole family?

[01:42:48.330 --> 01:42:49.290]
Sure, no problem

[01:42:49.290 --> 01:42:50.730]
All right, take it easy now

[01:42:50.730 --> 01:42:51.910]
Okay, say hi to a mic

[01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:52.390]
Who do?

[01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:53.530]
Okay, 1253

[01:42:53.530 --> 01:42:54.630]
Yeah, you heard me talk about it

[01:42:54.630 --> 01:42:55.250]
I told you about her

[01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:55.710]
Did you?

[01:42:56.170 --> 01:42:56.890]
Yeah, I saw him

[01:42:56.890 --> 01:42:57.510]
You met him? Yeah

[01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:59.430]
Oh, he's a funny guy, he really is

[01:42:59.430 --> 01:43:00.810]
He's hysterical

[01:43:00.810 --> 01:43:01.250]
Now, he said

[01:43:01.890 --> 01:43:03.450]
Three or four strokes

[01:43:03.450 --> 01:43:05.790]
And he was in this time he had chest pain

[01:43:05.790 --> 01:43:07.030]
He had not a stroke or heart attack

[01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:08.970]
But he had chest pain and some other problems

[01:43:08.970 --> 01:43:10.950]
And he's like 68 I think he said

[01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:11.670]
Something like that

[01:43:12.170 --> 01:43:13.410]
And strong as a horse

[01:43:13.410 --> 01:43:14.490]
I mean just incredible

[01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:16.670]
I know you're getting bored

[01:43:16.670 --> 01:43:17.910]
Okay, Miami, hello

[01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:18.650]
Hi, Neil

[01:43:19.190 --> 01:43:19.630]
Hi

[01:43:19.630 --> 01:43:20.450]
I'm in a real jam

[01:43:20.450 --> 01:43:21.930]
Maybe you can help

[01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:23.750]
Yes

[01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:25.850]
I moved to Southern California

[01:43:25.850 --> 01:43:28.390]
And I can't find a good talk show host

[01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:30.070]
Well, you'll have to move again

[01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:31.970]
What are you doing here?

[01:43:32.230 --> 01:43:34.530]
My mother lives here and I came to help her move

[01:43:34.530 --> 01:43:35.910]
And I've worked I have to move

[01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:36.930]
Why, is she leaving too?

[01:43:37.290 --> 01:43:38.030]
No, she moved out

[01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:39.230]
Maybe that's what happened to the audience

[01:43:39.230 --> 01:43:40.510]
Maybe they all moved out of town

[01:43:40.510 --> 01:43:42.570]
No, she just moved down the street

[01:43:42.570 --> 01:43:45.470]
Two other condos so I came into help her but I can't

[01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:46.310]
To the condo?

[01:43:46.710 --> 01:43:47.550]
From one to another

[01:43:49.370 --> 01:43:52.190]
But I can't find a good talk show host

[01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:54.310]
Well, I'll get out of here

[01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:56.430]
Your buddy don't like us, forget it

[01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:57.290]
Oh, he's terrible

[01:43:57.290 --> 01:43:58.070]
He sucks

[01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:59.670]
He sucks

[01:44:00.250 --> 01:44:02.930]
He's like a poor little brat Tom Leicas

[01:44:02.930 --> 01:44:03.890]
He stinks

[01:44:03.890 --> 01:44:04.630]
Big

[01:44:04.630 --> 01:44:06.630]
It's like most restaurants down here

[01:44:06.630 --> 01:44:08.310]
You say can't complain about the service here

[01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:09.090]
Because they don't have any

[01:44:09.090 --> 01:44:10.010]
Same thing

[01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:11.670]
Well, at least they have decent food here

[01:44:11.670 --> 01:44:14.290]
I can't find a good restaurant in Orange County

[01:44:14.290 --> 01:44:15.310]
Oh, come on

[01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:17.630]
They do have a bad food in California

[01:44:17.630 --> 01:44:19.730]
I don't think I ever had a bad meal in California

[01:44:19.730 --> 01:44:21.630]
They're all health food, freaks

[01:44:21.630 --> 01:44:21.950]
Well

[01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:23.090]
Nothing is...

[01:44:23.730 --> 01:44:24.790]
Don't you like Mexican?

[01:44:25.190 --> 01:44:26.490]
They got great Mexican restaurants

[01:44:26.490 --> 01:44:28.590]
Sure, but you can't have Mexican every day

[01:44:28.590 --> 01:44:32.030]
I always got jack into box if you want to stick your finger down your throat

[01:44:32.770 --> 01:44:33.910]
Or Carl's Jr

[01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:35.110]
Oh, please

[01:44:35.110 --> 01:44:35.730]
I know

[01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:37.390]
But no idea

[01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:38.590]
Well, where are you? Are you Nellie?

[01:44:38.590 --> 01:44:41.530]
Well, I'm in a little town called Sunset Beach

[01:44:41.530 --> 01:44:42.950]
It's just south of LA

[01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:44.950]
It's actually Orange County

[01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:45.250]
Ooh

[01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:48.110]
Well, there are a lot of people like wear sheets

[01:44:49.110 --> 01:44:50.530]
No, it's nice there

[01:44:50.530 --> 01:44:51.190]
Okay

[01:44:51.850 --> 01:44:54.190]
Well, go over to Santa Monica, you'll have a good time there

[01:44:54.190 --> 01:44:56.230]
Hang out with Jane Fonda and the whole gang

[01:44:56.230 --> 01:44:58.490]
But no talk shows you can recommend

[01:44:58.490 --> 01:44:59.830]
There are no talk shows in LA

[01:44:59.830 --> 01:45:02.190]
It's a very...I mean, you got K-A-B-C

[01:45:02.190 --> 01:45:05.050]
With all those plastic Michael Jackson, all those really boring people

[01:45:05.050 --> 01:45:05.950]
Oh, God, is he boring

[01:45:05.950 --> 01:45:08.170]
And then you got K-F-I, which is our sister station

[01:45:08.170 --> 01:45:10.370]
With speaker itself, you got Likus and...

[01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:11.230]
What's his name?

[01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:13.910]
The right winger, what's his name?

[01:45:14.110 --> 01:45:14.990]
Oh, the network guy

[01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.330]
Yeah

[01:45:15.330 --> 01:45:16.950]
Rush, Bimbo

[01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:17.310]
Rush

[01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.870]
Bush Bimbo

[01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:20.730]
And, you know, not too much

[01:45:20.730 --> 01:45:26.610]
There's a Valley station KGIO has a talk lineup, has some good people on it if you can get them

[01:45:27.410 --> 01:45:27.810]
KGIO

[01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:29.250]
I'll try that

[01:45:29.250 --> 01:45:30.990]
But you have to be a Valley girl to listen

[01:45:31.710 --> 01:45:33.470]
Well, not, I'm really, it might be...

[01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:35.650]
Well, give us a call, collect from out there sometime

[01:45:35.650 --> 01:45:37.730]
And we're always lately, we got a lot open call

[01:45:37.730 --> 01:45:41.550]
Since I got sick, man, they just hate me like poison because I'm depressing and negative

[01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:44.210]
And they want everybody to be real upbeat, you know?

[01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:47.010]
Well, I will, I'll give you a call, I'll be back in a few days

[01:45:47.010 --> 01:45:47.390]
Okay

[01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:48.850]
All right, thanks, Neil, feel better

[01:45:48.850 --> 01:45:49.510]
Okay, thanks

[01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.870]
Bye-bye

[01:45:50.890 --> 01:45:54.570]
1256 in WIO, it would be like you're lying on the floor, you know, having a heart attack

[01:45:54.570 --> 01:45:56.170]
You can't you be a little more positive?

[01:45:56.630 --> 01:46:00.970]
You know, maybe you're not feeling good, but can't you give us a little yuck and laugh out here?

[01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:02.210]
We don't want to hear your problems

[01:46:02.210 --> 01:46:03.230]
They're desperate

[01:46:03.230 --> 01:46:06.530]
They are desperate, in more ways than one, have you seen most of them?

[01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:07.130]
Miami

[01:46:07.570 --> 01:46:08.350]
Hi, Neil

[01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:08.890]
Hi

[01:46:08.890 --> 01:46:09.530]
Hi

[01:46:10.350 --> 01:46:11.690]
I'm glad to see that you're back

[01:46:11.690 --> 01:46:14.310]
Thank you, you heard that you're back and you just found wonderful

[01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:15.430]
I'm doing much better

[01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:19.470]
Great, I would like to make a...

[01:46:19.470 --> 01:46:22.290]
Although I just saw Tom Dendinberg walk down the hall, I may have a relapse

[01:46:22.290 --> 01:46:27.170]
I think Mac did it, it's doing it to Val

[01:46:27.170 --> 01:46:30.670]
I mean to, to his wife, Karen

[01:46:30.670 --> 01:46:32.690]
Yeah, Mac, he's too good

[01:46:32.690 --> 01:46:35.570]
Oh, they would Mac could never do that, come on

[01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:39.190]
No, Mac is Mr. Purety, Mr. Norway

[01:46:39.190 --> 01:46:41.850]
I know, but wouldn't you just like to see him change it a little bit?

[01:46:42.330 --> 01:46:48.010]
No, let's see, if I had to pick someone, maybe William DeVain is doing it

[01:46:48.730 --> 01:46:53.290]
That's interesting, because he certainly would like to be doing it with everything that moves, I know the sand

[01:46:53.290 --> 01:47:00.070]
You have such a great, wonderful show, I'm so glad I found you, everything on FM is really crummy

[01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:06.870]
Yeah, maybe Pat Peterson is doing it, maybe he's trying to get even with mom for making it such a panty waste

[01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:09.210]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:47:09.710 --> 01:47:11.130]
Yeah, you catch my drift

[01:47:11.130 --> 01:47:13.830]
What about Mac Secretary? She needs a bigger role

[01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:19.430]
Yeah, well she's got one, it's an onion roll, she just got it at Carl's Jr.'s matter of fact

[01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:21.030]
At a Ralph supermarket

[01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:25.810]
Well listen, oh look at that, Chuck Myers in there, what was that?

[01:47:25.810 --> 01:47:30.850]
I wrote that letter from later or something, you're coming up with some of the most bizarre stuff, Chuck

[01:47:30.850 --> 01:47:36.230]
I think too many pirate losses lately, like last night, and too much of that stuff he been getting into

[01:47:36.690 --> 01:47:39.910]
Well, I look what it did to our friend, anyway listen, it's great hearing from you

[01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:40.530]
Okay

[01:47:40.530 --> 01:47:41.430]
And have a good one

[01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:41.890]
Stay well

[01:47:41.890 --> 01:47:43.250]
Bye-bye

[01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:45.590]
Poor Chuck, boys, he's going to have a newscaster want to clock

[01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:48.550]
Things have been a little bit slow lately, so he's been busy making up the hot stuff

[01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:54.490]
He also has Alex Dowd locked in the news booth there, and boy are they going to have some finger-looking good stories to tell

[01:47:54.490 --> 01:47:59.910]
I hear Chuck on the 7 o'clock news in the morning, he's morning guy now, and then he gets out of here in the afternoon

[01:47:59.910 --> 01:48:04.510]
We have what's his name, Sean Cassidy, Shane Thomas

[01:48:04.510 --> 01:48:05.890]
The Pirates lose?

[01:48:06.170 --> 01:48:11.510]
Yes, 4 to 1 to the Dodgers last night, and the Cubs won by the way, 7 to 4, they had 15 hits, they're breaking out of it

[01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:12.070]
Uh-oh

[01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:16.930]
And the lookout is all I can tell you, lookout because we're on our way from San Jose

[01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:19.070]
I taped that game, I didn't know the fight

[01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:23.990]
And we got Mike Harkey on this afternoon, so if you get a home and you got a satellite dish which you don't have, it'll be a-

[01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:28.850]
But you can call me at home if the Cubs win, I'll give you all the report, and the buck goes R&L again tonight

[01:48:28.850 --> 01:48:30.830]
And they're pitching Harvey Haddicks

[01:48:31.730 --> 01:48:37.390]
Okay, get in there and let's look at our chops for this exciting newscast, it's the big one, two hour coming up after the news

[01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:43.710]
Rick and Puts are in the building now, they're going through my carts, and they'll be along with the two to six open phones today

[01:48:43.710 --> 01:48:50.450]
And the wrestling people in Mamacho, Randy Savage, and all new macho guys, these guys are for you, man, they're so butch, it's disgusting

[01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:58.270]
It's the VAM2TUEWA, hi babe

[01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:10.870]
560 WQAM, and Gilco presents the Singing Sensation of the 90s radio legend and Tachyo groupie, Gilberts, sings for you

[01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:20.350]
Loud loud, get a loud, I get a loud, Fuddy woman, walking down the street, Fuddy woman, the kind I like to meet

[01:49:20.350 --> 01:49:23.250]
Is Gilbert's magic from A to Z?

[01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:30.570]
Wild thing, you make my heart sing, you make everything gloomy, wild thing

You get every record ever recorded from the animals to the zombies, who could forget this timeless classic

These boots are made for walking, and that's just what they'll do, one of these days these boots are gonna lock all over you

[01:49:46.690 --> 01:49:56.290]
And the song that said America's romantic hearts on fire, strangest and the night, exchanging glances, strangest and the night

[01:49:56.290 --> 01:50:03.010]
They're all sung just for you by Gilbert, ever sung, ever written, every song, ever recorded

[01:50:03.010 --> 01:50:07.630]
Interpreted just for you by the golden throat himself, Gilbert

[01:50:07.630 --> 01:50:13.710]

Order yours today, the 40 records setter, true CDs, just 995 plus $26 shipping and handling

[01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:21.690]

Order today for operators are standing by to take your order now, this record collection is not available in stores, they wouldn't have it

[01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:37.690]

Say me out to the ball game, say me out to the crowd, buy me some peanuts and crackers

[01:50:52.190 --> 01:50:56.010]
Remember, if you want it right, it's got to be Gilco

[01:51:01.150 --> 01:51:06.430]
I like that part at the end where it was kind of like the drumroll fades and then it makes it come back

[01:51:08.350 --> 01:51:09.990]
Are you stepping on me already?

[01:51:10.210 --> 01:51:12.830]
He just came in here and already I stood like in the middle of a stage

[01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:13.850]
You guys are so happy and proud

[01:51:13.850 --> 01:51:17.810]
Well no, I want to be real negative again, I don't want to get your audience all hooked up

[01:51:17.810 --> 01:51:20.510]
That one douchebag, you guys, I know it's just what?

[01:51:20.930 --> 01:51:26.490]
No, there were at least three, the one there was the one guy, the, well that's stopped, that's not going to happen

[01:51:26.490 --> 01:51:32.430]
No, what was the one guy, I guess you know him, he calls himself the something in Coral Springs, what did he call him so?

[01:51:33.210 --> 01:51:33.750]
I don't know

[01:51:34.510 --> 01:51:38.230]
Yeah, oh absolutely, Mr. Gina, he's another pus

[01:51:38.850 --> 01:51:44.030]
No, he's not a chronic regular, no, this is somebody, one of your people, one of the four guys you had listening to Waxi

[01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:53.110]
And then later on, there was some young pseudo intellectual yuppie, oh I used to listen to more but I haven't listened because you guys are so positive and he's so negative

[01:51:53.110 --> 01:51:57.290]
And like I said, my second week, I was real positive too, now give it about a month

[01:51:57.290 --> 01:52:02.150]
And when you sit here and you keep giving the number 40 times, you guys have read all the jokes and your jokes

[01:52:02.150 --> 01:52:03.190]
I'm not all that positive

[01:52:04.810 --> 01:52:06.590]
Well what the hell is wrong with you?

[01:52:06.670 --> 01:52:07.590]
Crap going on

[01:52:07.590 --> 01:52:08.290]
What's your problem?

[01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:10.050]
That's not working

[01:52:10.050 --> 01:52:15.510]
Second week on the show, I already is bitching and complaining, okay, don't be a mal content, they don't like that around here

[01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:16.730]
I'm not working that way

[01:52:16.730 --> 01:52:21.690]
They like it like Reneerie, keep your mouth shut, do the show and get the hell out

[01:52:21.690 --> 01:52:22.350]
It's good advice

[01:52:22.350 --> 01:52:24.230]
And don't mess with management, okay?

[01:52:24.230 --> 01:52:25.950]
And stay the hell away

[01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:28.230]
And leave the sports department alone

[01:52:28.230 --> 01:52:28.870]
Alright

[01:52:32.490 --> 01:52:32.930]
Right?

[01:52:33.730 --> 01:52:33.970]
Right

[01:52:33.970 --> 01:52:36.170]
Okay, you're hired

[01:52:36.170 --> 01:52:36.870]
Hello Neil

[01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:37.590]
Yes sir

[01:52:37.590 --> 01:52:38.710]
What do you think of Reneerie?

[01:52:38.710 --> 01:52:39.270]
What do you like to do?

[01:52:40.050 --> 01:52:41.270]
What do I think of Rene'Sotion?

[01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:42.210]
Yes, Nibbukrano

[01:52:42.210 --> 01:52:45.270]
Lapping stock of the history of radio sir

[01:52:45.270 --> 01:52:46.250]
But he's the piece of theft

[01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:48.870]
Yeah, that's why he's got a point three sir

[01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:51.890]
We have an opening and date, one in Broward and one in Palm Beach

[01:52:51.890 --> 01:52:57.510]
We have Stan, we have Rick of Rick and Puts, Puts is in the other room putting on his argyle socks

[01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:58.750]
W-Y-O-D

[01:52:58.750 --> 01:52:59.650]
Hi Neil

[01:52:59.650 --> 01:53:01.170]
Hold on one moment please

[01:53:01.170 --> 01:53:02.570]
Oh no, just go ahead

[01:53:02.570 --> 01:53:04.750]
Nick can't do the call, I can't believe it

[01:53:04.750 --> 01:53:05.130]
I can

[01:53:06.270 --> 01:53:10.250]
He's had a lot of business on that other phone today, he must know wonder he's got the first Marvin

[01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:15.930]
David, Marvin's out yield today, I know that's unusual, but Marvin had, he almost had a string like Ryan Sandberg going there

[01:53:15.930 --> 01:53:19.290]
He had like four consecutive days that he showed up

[01:53:19.290 --> 01:53:19.970]
Oh yeah?

[01:53:21.090 --> 01:53:25.230]
If you got to tell you, you're answering your own phones Saturday, there's no extra in this show

[01:53:25.230 --> 01:53:26.450]
Oh I wonder if you're wondering if you're doing this

[01:53:26.450 --> 01:53:27.650]
This lady's trying to talk

[01:53:27.650 --> 01:53:29.690]
Oh, tell her to put her on hold

[01:53:29.690 --> 01:53:32.090]
Are they depressing?

[01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:34.930]
They got a crappy attitude man, I'm getting really sick of it

[01:53:34.930 --> 01:53:37.990]
I like to be looked at the positive things in life

[01:53:38.530 --> 01:53:41.150]
Like going home at two o'clock and watching the Cubs win

[01:53:41.150 --> 01:53:42.850]
Well I have something else positive now

[01:53:42.850 --> 01:53:45.250]
But if they lose tomorrow, I'll be real negative in depressing again

[01:53:45.250 --> 01:53:46.750]
You guys are a great team

[01:53:47.690 --> 01:53:49.410]
Cut the crap, go ahead

[01:53:49.410 --> 01:53:51.910]
Okay, go ahead, I'm reading this on a magazine

[01:53:52.670 --> 01:54:00.590]
And it says, at press time there's been no further work from CBS on its plans to launch a summer spin-off series starring young Pat Peter Sein

[01:54:00.590 --> 01:54:02.890]
Yeah, we got that at some time back, yeah

[01:54:03.530 --> 01:54:03.970]
Wow

[01:54:03.970 --> 01:54:06.730]
So that's how much I think I'm taking the whole summer off

[01:54:09.150 --> 01:54:11.970]
I'm gonna have a little relapse right about the first of June

[01:54:11.970 --> 01:54:13.150]
We'll have to wait and see

[01:54:13.150 --> 01:54:14.810]
Yeah, won't that be exciting?

[01:54:14.810 --> 01:54:15.230]
Yeah

[01:54:15.810 --> 01:54:21.590]
I don't know if he can get through the whole summer without doing anything but knowing the way they've written that character I think it's possible

[01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:24.670]
Did you didn't hear the end of the unit?

[01:54:24.670 --> 01:54:26.990]
He's a unique character, what is it?

[01:54:27.190 --> 01:54:28.570]
Did you hear my interview with him?

[01:54:29.190 --> 01:54:29.330]
Yes

[01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:31.350]
And then he said he heard an autograph picture

[01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:34.810]
He said, love and kisses and I think there was something on it

[01:54:34.810 --> 01:54:40.010]
He started to get a little surly after the third guy called in to talk about Nicolet Sheridan

[01:54:40.590 --> 01:54:42.930]
Yeah, they did a lot of them talk about her didn't they?

[01:54:42.930 --> 01:54:44.450]
Yeah, I don't think they get along well

[01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:46.710]
I think they schedule him again to call

[01:54:47.710 --> 01:54:48.110]
Hi

[01:54:48.110 --> 01:54:50.210]
I think he should call me a photograph, yeah

[01:54:50.810 --> 01:54:52.150]
Yeah, I think we can have that

[01:54:52.150 --> 01:54:53.990]
It's celebrity, what is it? Celebrity sleuth?

[01:54:54.170 --> 01:54:56.150]
He's not interested in that, he's not interested in the whole box

[01:54:56.150 --> 01:54:57.890]
Peter Sein being photographed in the news

[01:54:57.890 --> 01:55:00.030]
Yeah, where do I get down? Turned out it was a lookalike

[01:55:00.030 --> 01:55:00.890]
Did you hear that?

[01:55:01.170 --> 01:55:01.450]
Yeah

[01:55:01.450 --> 01:55:02.790]
The cards started

[01:55:04.350 --> 01:55:05.550]
And it stopped

[01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:06.470]
It stopped

[01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:09.370]
Rogers got these things rigged, these are LA lawn machines

[01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:13.250]
It started to stop like an automatic arrow

[01:55:13.850 --> 01:55:15.670]
Was that louder one huh?

[01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:16.290]
Wow

[01:55:16.290 --> 01:55:19.090]
Bring it up and piss off the LA lawn fans

[01:55:19.090 --> 01:55:20.750]
And GTR

[01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:21.310]
That's it

[01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:23.690]
Oh, did I hit that little poster? That was good

[01:55:23.690 --> 01:55:24.250]
That was nice

[01:55:24.250 --> 01:55:26.870]
Anyway, almost like Ricky Tiki yesterday

[01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:28.130]
Give you a hat

[01:55:28.130 --> 01:55:28.670]
Yeah

[01:55:28.670 --> 01:55:29.790]
So anyways

[01:55:30.370 --> 01:55:30.830]
Well listen

[01:55:31.330 --> 01:55:33.750]
Okay, it's gonna be a real thriller tomorrow night

[01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:36.250]
And if I pick it up on a satellite I'll spoil it for you tomorrow

[01:55:36.250 --> 01:55:36.810]
Okay

[01:55:36.810 --> 01:55:37.410]
Okay, see

[01:55:38.150 --> 01:55:39.930]
It's 11 after 1 at W.I.O.

[01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:42.070]
What are those phones? They're going pretty good today, aren't they?

[01:55:42.070 --> 01:55:43.450]
We had a couple of adult moments

[01:55:43.450 --> 01:55:46.590]
But considering that Stan is here knowing how he pressing and boring he is

[01:55:46.590 --> 01:55:50.330]
And he actually brought out some of the people who hate him, some of those young up

[01:55:50.330 --> 01:55:50.650]
That's great

[01:55:50.650 --> 01:55:51.590]
I heard

[01:55:51.590 --> 01:55:52.470]
That's too much

[01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:54.690]
That gets the adrenaline going

[01:55:54.690 --> 01:55:55.350]
That gets everything

[01:55:55.850 --> 01:55:57.530]
That gets this blood boiling man

[01:55:57.530 --> 01:55:57.750]
What?

[01:55:57.870 --> 01:55:58.610]
Makes him feel good

[01:55:58.610 --> 01:56:00.650]
Who when people call in and bitch at me

[01:56:00.650 --> 01:56:01.170]
Me?

[01:56:01.490 --> 01:56:02.190]
Makes you feel good

[01:56:02.190 --> 01:56:03.750]
I don't want my blood boiling

[01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:05.810]
And I don't want my, I just want to be nice and calm

[01:56:05.810 --> 01:56:08.450]
Like I have been all day, you know, it's seeming getting hysterical

[01:56:08.450 --> 01:56:08.850]
Right?

[01:56:09.650 --> 01:56:10.350]
Screw you

[01:56:10.850 --> 01:56:12.250]
Alright, we have an opening in date

[01:56:12.250 --> 01:56:15.990]
It's getting real upset about that because the Rick and Puts are surveying the situation

[01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:19.290]
They never have any open lines on their show, man

[01:56:19.290 --> 01:56:22.070]
They must kneel right here and have his seat at 5 o'clock

[01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:24.870]
No, they were full at 5 o'clock, I just said that on the U.S.

[01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:27.930]
Yeah, you were talking to your biggest bunch of pussheads I ever heard in my life

[01:56:27.930 --> 01:56:28.890]
W-I-O-D

[01:56:28.890 --> 01:56:30.590]
Get those guys out of your studio

[01:56:30.590 --> 01:56:32.150]
Exactly, what the hell are they doing?

[01:56:32.290 --> 01:56:32.770]
Get them out

[01:56:32.770 --> 01:56:34.470]
What the hell do you want, sir?

[01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:36.070]
Exactly, this caller was right

[01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:40.330]
Alright, we'll take a break while we try to rectify the situation

[01:56:40.330 --> 01:56:42.270]
It's 112 in W-I-O-D

[01:56:42.270 --> 01:56:44.550]
I prefer Stan Major

[01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:46.530]
I prefer Stan Major

[01:56:46.530 --> 01:56:48.970]
I definitely prefer Stan Major

[01:56:48.970 --> 01:56:50.630]
I prefer Stan Major

[01:56:50.630 --> 01:56:53.730]
I prefer Stan Major

[01:56:53.730 --> 01:56:55.330]
I prefer Stan Major

[01:56:55.330 --> 01:56:57.130]
I prefer Stan Major

[01:56:57.130 --> 01:56:58.310]
I prefer Stan Major

[01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.470]
I personally don't

[01:56:59.050 --> 01:57:02.930]
There you have it, 9 out of 10 doctors prefer Stan Major

[01:57:02.930 --> 01:57:04.730]
Over General anesthesia

[01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:06.730]
116 in W-I-O-D

[01:57:06.730 --> 01:57:07.770]
You're the interesting thing there

[01:57:07.770 --> 01:57:10.570]
But the interesting part about that card I was just thinking that

[01:57:10.570 --> 01:57:13.270]
Is that about half the voices on there are no longer here

[01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:13.950]
That's true

[01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:15.750]
And I think if you wait about another three months

[01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:17.950]
Here's a mobile and brow it got to be gone

[01:57:17.950 --> 01:57:18.750]
Got to be gone

[01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:19.350]
I'm here

[01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:20.590]
I can't believe it

[01:57:21.070 --> 01:57:22.630]
What a loyal caller

[01:57:22.630 --> 01:57:24.490]
Hey, I hung out through the ads and everything

[01:57:24.490 --> 01:57:26.890]
God Almighty, this guy must be ready to rip us

[01:57:26.890 --> 01:57:27.970]
No, not at all

[01:57:27.970 --> 01:57:30.370]
What a nice guy

[01:57:30.370 --> 01:57:31.390]
I'm a good guy

[01:57:31.390 --> 01:57:34.350]
You can't be in South Florida or there will be a negative again

[01:57:34.350 --> 01:57:35.070]
Oh no, yes

[01:57:35.070 --> 01:57:35.750]
Because we all know

[01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:36.810]
How am I native?

[01:57:37.730 --> 01:57:39.130]
Born here in 1960

[01:57:39.130 --> 01:57:41.150]
Well, we apologize to you

[01:57:41.150 --> 01:57:44.670]
Not that I did it but a lot of people owe you an apology

[01:57:44.670 --> 01:57:45.610]
They do

[01:57:46.530 --> 01:57:47.830]
They've done a best town

[01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:49.390]
How anybody can question

[01:57:49.390 --> 01:57:51.170]
I mean I've been here a long time doing this

[01:57:51.170 --> 01:57:53.130]
It's not like this is my second week, okay?

[01:57:53.370 --> 01:57:54.370]
To the young pseudo

[01:57:54.370 --> 01:57:57.530]
The young sueds that's a new soap opera coming soon to Fox

[01:57:57.530 --> 01:57:59.130]
The young sueds

[01:57:59.130 --> 01:58:00.910]
Well, I'm the best native here

[01:58:00.910 --> 01:58:01.570]
Great

[01:58:02.150 --> 01:58:04.010]
Neil, did you move out of where you live?

[01:58:04.650 --> 01:58:05.510]
No comment

[01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:06.210]
No comment

[01:58:06.210 --> 01:58:09.930]
I don't discuss anything about where I live, where I live, where I live, where I live

[01:58:09.930 --> 01:58:10.990]
I noticed that Fred and Brian saw moving, man

[01:58:10.990 --> 01:58:13.430]
Well, that must have been my neighbors across the street

[01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:14.030]
Oh, okay

[01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:18.730]
And number two, someone called it, I think it was Rick said that

[01:58:18.730 --> 01:58:21.090]
As a matter of fact, the people across the street did move in

[01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:23.030]
Just the very day you're talking about it

[01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:23.390]
Okay

[01:58:24.210 --> 01:58:26.450]
Rick said Stan looks like Jerry Lee Lewis

[01:58:26.450 --> 01:58:27.290]
No

[01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:30.530]
I think Stan looks like Max on Heart to Heart

[01:58:31.490 --> 01:58:33.850]
Well, I don't want to show someone who Max is

[01:58:34.810 --> 01:58:37.610]
No, he looks more like Leo the leprechaun

[01:58:37.610 --> 01:58:38.830]
Oh, close, yeah

[01:58:38.830 --> 01:58:40.010]
What's wrong with that?

[01:58:40.650 --> 01:58:41.510]
That is pretty good

[01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:43.970]
Exactly, that ought to give three leprechaun calls

[01:58:47.010 --> 01:58:47.910]
That's my favorite

[01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:49.970]
I can't believe that guy followed me from Williams

[01:58:49.970 --> 01:58:52.710]
Oh, well, what about the guy with Lardas?

[01:58:52.970 --> 01:58:53.770]
He follows you everywhere

[01:58:53.770 --> 01:58:54.910]
Boomer, oh, exactly

[01:58:54.910 --> 01:58:56.410]
Loyalist, yeah, that's what we want

[01:58:56.410 --> 01:58:58.330]
Oh, I don't care if they're good or not, as long as they're loyal

[01:58:59.170 --> 01:59:02.930]
And did you know that Gilbert was that with Rick and Sputts

[01:59:02.930 --> 01:59:04.030]
At the art show on the camera?

[01:59:04.030 --> 01:59:07.570]
They just told me that he showed up as if I was supposed to be surprised

[01:59:07.570 --> 01:59:11.030]
Well, not only that, but right before they went off the air

[01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:13.790]
He had this thing take me out to the vlog and...

[01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:15.330]
Oh, God, are you serious?

[01:59:15.570 --> 01:59:16.030]
No, I'm serious

[01:59:16.030 --> 01:59:17.150]
Oh, no

[01:59:18.070 --> 01:59:21.070]
They're wonderful guys, they're doing great, the whole audience seems to love them

[01:59:21.070 --> 01:59:24.690]
But please get an act, I mean, don't lie, it's embarrassing, you know?

[01:59:25.210 --> 01:59:28.650]
Don't do my show, don't do my show and my...

[01:59:28.650 --> 01:59:32.510]
Oh, I can say that they're a production, I'm cutting a film

[01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:35.570]
I was like tripping over the roadways, I heard it

[01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:36.030]
I know

[01:59:36.690 --> 01:59:40.110]
Well listen, that's one thing they can steal with my blessings, I'll pack a sandwich

[01:59:40.690 --> 01:59:41.410]
I'm sure you would

[01:59:41.410 --> 01:59:42.610]
Okay, have a wonderful life

[01:59:42.610 --> 01:59:42.890]
Hey, wait!

[01:59:43.230 --> 01:59:48.410]
Yeah, oh, I just want to say hello to my friends Tony and Jay, up in that God forsaken place of Lake Worth

[01:59:48.410 --> 01:59:49.090]
Okay

[01:59:49.710 --> 01:59:50.790]
Are they over 100?

[01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:52.910]
No, just under

[01:59:52.910 --> 01:59:55.110]
Must be getting close, have a good one

[01:59:55.110 --> 01:59:55.430]
Bye-bye

[01:59:56.090 --> 02:00:01.030]
119 at WIOD, we have an opening in Broward, if you move very fast like lightning, you're Steve used to say

[02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:02.310]
I wonder where he's going to wind up

[02:00:04.410 --> 02:00:05.290]
You're looking at me?

[02:00:05.570 --> 02:00:07.470]
No, I'm just thinking out loud

[02:00:07.470 --> 02:00:09.250]
You're going to be back working for Dennis, can't we?

[02:00:09.610 --> 02:00:11.410]
Well, oh, geez, what a quinoa they

[02:00:11.410 --> 02:00:13.290]
Hey, that's going to be a thing

[02:00:13.290 --> 02:00:16.110]
They are going to pay him the job now, they're not going to pay him that kind of money

[02:00:16.110 --> 02:00:18.070]
He can't afford to live on what?

[02:00:18.170 --> 02:00:19.570]
What did Al get in the last start up?

[02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:19.910]
Reading

[02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:21.170]
But two won

[02:00:21.170 --> 02:00:22.370]
But two won in the morning

[02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.910]
That's big

[02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:26.170]
Yeah, oh, that whole station is in the toilet

[02:00:26.170 --> 02:00:29.290]
If you think we went down, they were like non-existent

[02:00:29.290 --> 02:00:33.550]
Not only, it's not only what the share is, but then when you analyze the demographic

[02:00:34.710 --> 02:00:36.070]
It's how Debbie do

[02:00:36.070 --> 02:00:38.070]
Death plus, she had a two-four I think

[02:00:38.070 --> 02:00:39.850]
No, we're all in the twos

[02:00:39.850 --> 02:00:44.310]
Yeah, except at night, I don't know, I think Wichner had a three or something, which is like a big number over there now

[02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:45.030]
They're dead

[02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:47.430]
You realize the shift that they have him more?

[02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:47.690]
What?

[02:00:48.010 --> 02:00:51.250]
The shift they have Wichner working eight until one

[02:00:51.250 --> 02:00:53.070]
Yeah, which is not his hours at all

[02:00:53.070 --> 02:00:55.070]
Which is why they're dying, because they don't know

[02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:57.150]
And in that sports thing they put in there

[02:00:57.150 --> 02:00:57.690]
Oh

[02:00:58.430 --> 02:01:00.450]
They had like a .5 in the 7 o'clock hour

[02:01:00.450 --> 02:01:02.550]
Although they did beat QAM who had a .3

[02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:07.230]
Our sports between 6 and 8 was like double those two stations put together

[02:01:07.770 --> 02:01:08.250]
Okay

[02:01:08.250 --> 02:01:11.250]
And would he be even higher except for Yankee baseball

[02:01:12.050 --> 02:01:13.030]
20 and 1

[02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.890]
The one?

[02:01:14.130 --> 02:01:16.190]
All the new stations in the country went up

[02:01:16.190 --> 02:01:17.690]
They all went up

[02:01:17.690 --> 02:01:18.470]
I don't believe it

[02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:19.270]
Across the country

[02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:20.090]
Oh, come on

[02:01:20.090 --> 02:01:20.530]
They did

[02:01:20.530 --> 02:01:21.430]
Get out of here

[02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:22.350]
Get out of town

[02:01:22.350 --> 02:01:23.090]
They did

[02:01:23.090 --> 02:01:24.190]
They did say on green acres

[02:01:24.190 --> 02:01:26.990]
Okay, 24 after one at WIOD

[02:01:26.990 --> 02:01:27.970]
We're having a wonderful day

[02:01:27.970 --> 02:01:30.270]
We're trying to be upbeat, not depressing, not too

[02:01:30.270 --> 02:01:33.350]
Yeah, you're really doesn't sound like the old Neil

[02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:34.750]
Up yours

[02:01:34.750 --> 02:01:36.590]
Let's go to Pompo

[02:01:37.190 --> 02:01:39.470]
Hey, how are you two wonderful guys

[02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:40.790]
We're having a great day pal

[02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:42.410]
It's a beautiful day at the Magic City

[02:01:42.970 --> 02:01:44.710]
By the way, before at the risk

[02:01:44.710 --> 02:01:45.770]
It's a beautiful day to get the bull

[02:01:45.770 --> 02:01:47.570]
Listen, hold it at the risk of being negative

[02:01:47.570 --> 02:01:50.770]
I forgot to mention that the people in Metro traffic need an animal

[02:01:50.770 --> 02:01:53.210]
I mean, they have the last few days

[02:01:53.210 --> 02:01:55.630]
You know, I haven't been back that long but my god

[02:01:55.630 --> 02:01:58.850]
Every time you hear for a traffic, it's either the wrong person or there's nobody there

[02:01:58.850 --> 02:02:01.350]
And when they do give the traffic, it is so wrong

[02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:02.390]
I was coming to work this morning

[02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:04.250]
I get off the turnpike at the Golden Glades

[02:02:04.250 --> 02:02:06.850]
And Joe, what's his name, Brennan is saying

[02:02:06.850 --> 02:02:09.210]
Oh, it's all backed up at the Golden Glades in 95

[02:02:09.210 --> 02:02:10.170]
It's a big delay

[02:02:10.710 --> 02:02:11.670]
We whipped through there

[02:02:11.670 --> 02:02:15.510]
I mean, all of them say we the traffic, including myself about 65 miles an hour

[02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:18.890]
There was no delay, there was no problem anywhere between there and here

[02:02:19.410 --> 02:02:21.750]
And they are just so far out of it, man

[02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:24.190]
They better get off those hallucinogens because they're losing it

[02:02:24.710 --> 02:02:25.390]
They're nuts

[02:02:25.970 --> 02:02:27.150]
Go ahead, sir, I'm sorry

[02:02:27.550 --> 02:02:29.070]
Well, it's trying to be positive

[02:02:29.070 --> 02:02:31.290]
I know, you know me, Mr. Depression

[02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:33.290]
Yeah, it's so damn negative

[02:02:33.290 --> 02:02:34.350]
It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day

[02:02:34.350 --> 02:02:36.130]
It is, it's a great day for doing it

[02:02:36.130 --> 02:02:37.090]
Hello, hello Rick

[02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:38.630]
So anyway

[02:02:39.730 --> 02:02:43.370]
So last night I met the defensive driving school

[02:02:43.370 --> 02:02:45.670]
I had a one of those, huh?

[02:02:46.230 --> 02:02:50.690]
One of those smart ass punks that drives about 100 miles an hour in the school zone?

[02:02:51.150 --> 02:02:54.410]
No, no, no, I just run over old people in Hellendale

[02:02:54.410 --> 02:02:54.670]
Good

[02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:59.510]
So anyway, I'm there at the class and we took a short 10 minute break

[02:02:59.510 --> 02:03:04.870]
So I strolled on down to the little coin drug store to have down there

[02:03:04.870 --> 02:03:08.410]
By the way, if there are any tourists still in town, the Hellendale J-walking kamikaze

[02:03:08.410 --> 02:03:11.910]
will be doing their things straight at 2 o'clock this afternoon on Hellendale Beach Boulevard

[02:03:11.910 --> 02:03:12.610]
You don't want to miss it

[02:03:12.610 --> 02:03:14.310]
Oh, definitely don't miss it

[02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:15.870]
Get over and make the fourth race at Goffin

[02:03:15.870 --> 02:03:18.850]
It's a great day, it's a great wonderful, wonderful day, don't miss it

[02:03:18.850 --> 02:03:21.270]
Although they're not open to their Gulf Stream, but you can't lose a dime

[02:03:22.450 --> 02:03:24.930]
So anyway, you were doing a hundred

[02:03:24.930 --> 02:03:26.890]
Yeah, right, 100, 100

[02:03:26.890 --> 02:03:30.930]
You went through 100 down the stairs for the quick 10 minute break and my defensive driving class

[02:03:30.930 --> 02:03:31.430]
And...

[02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:38.190]
And long behold, in the bottom shelf on the 45 cent candy machine was a Milky Way dark bar

[02:03:38.190 --> 02:03:39.790]
Wow, and did you get it?

[02:03:40.110 --> 02:03:40.590]
Oh, of course

[02:03:40.590 --> 02:03:41.250]
And...

[02:03:41.250 --> 02:03:42.150]
I got out six of them

[02:03:42.150 --> 02:03:44.170]
Now, why are you so happy today?

[02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:48.250]
Yes, well, I was happier this morning whenever they came out okay

[02:03:48.250 --> 02:03:51.290]
And when your blood sugar goes up to 600, you'll really be happy

[02:03:51.290 --> 02:03:52.710]
I'm a young guy, I'm a young guy

[02:03:52.710 --> 02:03:53.930]
Yeah, I know, you can handle it

[02:03:54.570 --> 02:03:57.190]
Well, this is a very, absolutely wonderful day

[02:03:57.190 --> 02:03:57.890]
And...

[02:03:57.890 --> 02:03:59.770]
I'm glad you liked my candy bar

[02:03:59.770 --> 02:04:05.590]
And remember, and never forget that this is a wonderful city and a wonderful town

[02:04:05.590 --> 02:04:06.810]
And it was a wonderful call

[02:04:06.810 --> 02:04:07.730]
Thank you very much

[02:04:07.730 --> 02:04:09.050]
And Bill and Ted say hi

[02:04:09.050 --> 02:04:09.930]
I thought I'd buy it

[02:04:09.930 --> 02:04:11.230]
And forever years live

[02:04:11.770 --> 02:04:15.450]
27 after one, the only reason you're trying to pump candies because you keep buying new sugars futures

[02:04:15.450 --> 02:04:16.870]
You're not fooling anybody, okay?

[02:04:17.170 --> 02:04:17.890]
I just bought another car

[02:04:17.890 --> 02:04:20.890]
Using the airwaves for a personal gain, okay?

[02:04:21.170 --> 02:04:24.770]
Little expose, they better get talian sandwiches over here now

[02:04:24.770 --> 02:04:26.870]
And old penny Daniels

[02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:27.830]
Did my broker call?

[02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:32.590]
We got a little expose here, the man with a sugar futures is peddling candy bar

[02:04:32.590 --> 02:04:37.130]
To rot your teeth and ruin your health ladies and gentlemen, don't pay any attention

[02:04:37.910 --> 02:04:41.110]
Heartless cruel bastard for Lauderdale

[02:04:41.110 --> 02:04:42.470]
Uh, the hour?

[02:04:42.630 --> 02:04:42.870]
Yeah

[02:04:43.550 --> 02:04:45.490]
This is a new wrist, a new wristner

[02:04:45.490 --> 02:04:46.870]
Well, that's wonderful

[02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:47.670]
My name is Nancy

[02:04:48.150 --> 02:04:49.630]
Nancy, where have you been?

[02:04:49.770 --> 02:04:52.390]
Uh, well, I've been missing twenty-one space for a second now

[02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:54.410]
Oh, Nancy, how can you do that?

[02:04:54.890 --> 02:04:55.930]
WFTL, but maybe 10

[02:04:56.690 --> 02:04:58.350]
WFTL, are they still on the air?

[02:04:58.410 --> 02:05:02.350]
Uh-oh, I just was telling her, telling her, you're so chained

[02:05:02.350 --> 02:05:04.930]
Last night, it gave it I was going to call you

[02:05:04.930 --> 02:05:05.450]
Really?

[02:05:05.530 --> 02:05:06.390]
That first contact

[02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:09.130]
Now, you didn't have that little kid there with him last night, did he?

[02:05:09.190 --> 02:05:11.550]
He didn't, but I just heard you

[02:05:11.550 --> 02:05:14.410]
I just heard you talk negatively about him

[02:05:14.410 --> 02:05:17.150]
I thought, isn't this interesting?

[02:05:17.410 --> 02:05:21.190]
Yeah, while we like to do that, you know, we like to have little back and forth, you know

[02:05:21.190 --> 02:05:24.330]
Especially when you have the listening audience at Ernie's God

[02:05:24.330 --> 02:05:27.730]
You could have him in your living room and have room left over for the Russian Army

[02:05:27.730 --> 02:05:28.710]
What about the Iran?

[02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:30.210]
Oh, now there is a winner

[02:05:32.190 --> 02:05:35.650]
Uh, Ernie, well, I'm sorry that you're a video

[02:05:35.650 --> 02:05:37.370]
Well, I'm doing real good now

[02:05:37.370 --> 02:05:40.370]
I don't know you, I'm sorry, hope that you're a continuation

[02:05:41.170 --> 02:05:42.050]
Good recovery

[02:05:42.050 --> 02:05:44.510]
Okay, well, you sound real chipper today

[02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:47.370]
Thank you, Anne, I'm looking forward to a big day Saturday

[02:05:47.370 --> 02:05:48.930]
I'm from Broadway

[02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:50.790]
Oh, great!

[02:05:51.290 --> 02:05:52.510]
Are you going up there?

[02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:54.210]
No, are you here though?

[02:05:54.430 --> 02:05:55.730]
But you'll watch it on the TV

[02:05:55.730 --> 02:05:59.510]
So my father had two of the best boxes to chill down?

[02:05:59.790 --> 02:06:01.710]
Well, who do you like in the Derby?

[02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:03.490]
Uh, I know who he is

[02:06:03.490 --> 02:06:04.750]
Mr. Frisky

[02:06:04.750 --> 02:06:05.890]
That's why I heard that

[02:06:05.890 --> 02:06:10.110]
Right, not going to pay very much, but I think he'll do it

[02:06:10.110 --> 02:06:10.570]
Uh-huh

[02:06:10.570 --> 02:06:12.190]
Well, maybe

[02:06:12.850 --> 02:06:15.110]
I don't know, is he talking about the security?

[02:06:15.310 --> 02:06:16.350]
Yeah, sure is

[02:06:17.890 --> 02:06:19.490]
Okay, Nancy, nice talking to you

[02:06:19.490 --> 02:06:20.010]
How about that?

[02:06:20.010 --> 02:06:20.770]
How about that?

[02:06:20.770 --> 02:06:21.870]
Was that her name, Nancy?

[02:06:22.050 --> 02:06:23.170]
I hope, well, my mind is going

[02:06:23.170 --> 02:06:26.650]
Anyway, Nick, how come Dave Johnson hasn't called us this year

[02:06:26.650 --> 02:06:28.250]
Like he did last year before the Derby

[02:06:28.250 --> 02:06:31.870]
I got a nice Christmas card from Dave from New York, from wherever

[02:06:32.850 --> 02:06:34.450]
And we're carrying the Derby

[02:06:34.450 --> 02:06:38.150]
Although Nick thought it was last week, it is this Saturday at 506 with

[02:06:38.150 --> 02:06:43.450]
Dave Johnson is the track announcer who will be calling the Derby as he does every year for ABC

[02:06:44.650 --> 02:06:46.970]
And, um, I think, don't they Simon Cass?

[02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:51.010]
Yeah, they Simon Cass, the thing I'm radioing TV, so we'll help you on here

[02:06:51.010 --> 02:06:54.890]
Yeah, and he called us last year for like the two, three days before the Derby and Chatted

[02:06:54.890 --> 02:06:58.770]
And Tom Durkin also, so maybe you can get a hold of him, okay?

[02:06:58.990 --> 02:06:59.510]
So to speak

[02:07:00.070 --> 02:07:02.010]
130, let's go look at those phones

[02:07:02.010 --> 02:07:05.870]
Yeah, they are, they're all in up and then take a picture of that right now

[02:07:05.870 --> 02:07:09.770]
Get, so wait a minute, yesterday I was asking about the Donny Osman pictures

[02:07:09.770 --> 02:07:12.510]
And all of a sudden everybody's mowed, oh, the George is a photographer

[02:07:12.970 --> 02:07:17.210]
And they're all like puking and everybody, what happened? Did he get deported or something? Where did he go?

[02:07:18.450 --> 02:07:23.170]
I guess it was Melvin was telling me, but you were in there and everybody was saying, God, what, how do you know he's gone?

[02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:30.810]
It says, Jorge is long gone, but how do you know that?

[02:07:31.170 --> 02:07:33.210]
I understand that, but how do we know for sure?

[02:07:33.330 --> 02:07:37.190]
But he's such a group if he was still around, he would have been, you know, he told you what?

[02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:41.030]
He told you what? Does that make sense to you? He told me

[02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:43.750]
He was leaving

[02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:50.770]
So he left town with my god damn Donny Osman pictures, huh? He's probably in Salt Lake City selling news douchebag

[02:07:51.290 --> 02:07:55.750]
Never trust a guy who just got off a rubber boat, okay? Especially on South Beach

[02:07:56.530 --> 02:07:58.250]
Okay, Wilton Manners, hello

[02:07:58.830 --> 02:08:01.410]
Yeah, howdy, I just have to drop those photos all the way up

[02:08:01.410 --> 02:08:06.730]
And I thank you profusely, they, I don't know about the orange, but the Red Raspberry Diet right is sensational

[02:08:06.730 --> 02:08:07.770]
I thought that's Tangerine

[02:08:07.770 --> 02:08:09.210]
Oh, that's Tangerine?

[02:08:09.210 --> 02:08:09.510]
Yeah

[02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:12.450]
Well, we're going to start singing that, we're going to have Alex come back to sing it

[02:08:12.450 --> 02:08:13.610]
That came down to the Red Raspberry

[02:08:14.210 --> 02:08:16.610]
Banana River area, it's about the only decent stuff there

[02:08:16.610 --> 02:08:18.010]
Delicious, and I thank you

[02:08:18.010 --> 02:08:22.790]
And if we get on the stick with publics and Windixie and force them to carry this stuff, it's good stuff

[02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:27.830]
Hey, the question was, I go up there about every other week, she's my mother, she's not old enough to live down here

[02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:28.230]
Right

[02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:32.190]
Okay

[02:08:32.190 --> 02:08:35.430]
If you figure out which flavor you want to drag you some down

[02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:42.310]
Hey, listen, these would be great, I mean these, I don't know what other ones they got, I guess I'll have to watch ESPN every day and see what flavors they're advertising

[02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:44.790]
Strawberry, lemon, these sort of thing

[02:08:44.790 --> 02:08:47.510]
Yeah, anything, I like them all, you know me, I'm easy

[02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:50.270]
All right, I appreciate it, thank you

[02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:51.590]
And say hi to mom

[02:08:51.590 --> 02:08:52.110]
We'll see

[02:08:52.110 --> 02:08:52.530]
Bye

[02:08:52.530 --> 02:09:02.310]
What a good guy, he brought down four big two-year bottles of the flavored diet right so does Red Raspberry and Tangerine are salt free, sodium free, caffeine free, and sugar free

[02:09:02.310 --> 02:09:06.890]
And I'm like some of those real extreme diets so does they are not paste free, you know

[02:09:06.890 --> 02:09:09.690]
Really, no this is really good, the Red Raspberry is delicious

[02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:13.110]
I used to drink diet right all the time before diet

[02:09:13.110 --> 02:09:17.310]
It's good, and if you're like a diabetic or on a real restricted diet or even like any of the diets

[02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:24.390]
Weight Watchers, Nutri-Assystem, they recommend if you're going to drink a lot of diet soda, use diet right because it doesn't have the caffeine, sodium

[02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:24.950]
Yeah

[02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:28.550]
Because you have a lot of sodium and you retain the water and you don't lose the weight

[02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:31.570]
I'm not doing a plug for them, but I'm sure we can get you

[02:09:31.570 --> 02:09:31.910]
Sure you are

[02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:35.150]
Here's a call for Stan, must be his broker, how's the sugar doing?

[02:09:35.310 --> 02:09:35.910]
That's okay

[02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:40.790]
I just want, it's not really for Stan, I just wanted to say hi and welcome back to the air, I've ever heard you in a while

[02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:41.430]
Yeah, all right

[02:09:41.430 --> 02:09:43.510]
Tomorrow night, sir, and then all next week

[02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:43.890]
Really?

[02:09:44.090 --> 02:09:45.050]
You're back, exciting?

[02:09:45.410 --> 02:09:47.950]
Yeah, that is, that's great, anyway, Neil

[02:09:47.950 --> 02:09:48.590]
Yes, sir

[02:09:49.010 --> 02:09:52.130]
Did you know that there are two Neil Rogers shows on the air every day?

[02:09:52.670 --> 02:09:53.770]
Ten to two and two to six

[02:09:53.770 --> 02:09:55.590]
No, I'm serious now

[02:09:56.530 --> 02:09:57.690]
I'm just a little joke

[02:09:57.690 --> 02:09:58.670]
Ten to two here

[02:09:58.670 --> 02:09:59.150]
Yes

[02:09:59.150 --> 02:10:01.790]
Okay, and then ten to two at night, over on FTL

[02:10:02.550 --> 02:10:03.990]
Who's doing my show over there now?

[02:10:04.050 --> 02:10:04.630]
Call Lyon

[02:10:05.010 --> 02:10:05.770]
I'm dead serious

[02:10:05.770 --> 02:10:07.790]
Call Lyon, he's back on air again

[02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:14.010]
He's got everything, he's got the dying over here callers, he's got every effort that is on the best of Neil Rogers

[02:10:14.010 --> 02:10:15.110]
Well, what are they going to play?

[02:10:15.370 --> 02:10:18.050]
One on FTL, my God, they must be ready to sign off

[02:10:18.050 --> 02:10:20.370]
And get this Gilbert call last night

[02:10:20.370 --> 02:10:21.050]
Well, I'm sure that

[02:10:21.050 --> 02:10:22.010]
And you know what he had to say?

[02:10:22.190 --> 02:10:23.330]
Is that a news bulletin?

[02:10:23.330 --> 02:10:27.230]
Brother, this is an update, this is so smartly, you know what he wanted to know?

[02:10:27.850 --> 02:10:31.490]
He says, I'll bet you got a lot of spy reports about me, how many spy reports?

[02:10:31.970 --> 02:10:33.130]
Oh, no

[02:10:33.130 --> 02:10:34.030]
He wanted to know how to play with me

[02:10:34.030 --> 02:10:41.190]
Oh, Lyon, Chang-Yer, this is the same guy who told Craig Ward, I've never spoken to Paul Lyon, I've never seen him in my life

[02:10:41.190 --> 02:10:47.270]
And he tells Craig Warding, he's a good friend of mine, shortly after I've been to hospital, I had spoken to Craig, and he says, oh no, Neil didn't have a stroke

[02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:49.350]
I know the inside story, I just spoke to him

[02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:56.750]
I've never spoken to the man in my life, he is the greatest BS artist since Steve Kane, since Steve, and maybe he made it to Steve

[02:10:56.750 --> 02:11:02.810]
He's good, he's real good, I don't know if he's playing these things out of the station or somebody's patching it through

[02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:05.370]
Maybe you need to check whoever's on the beach

[02:11:05.370 --> 02:11:08.490]
Oh, in other words, he's recording our stuff off the air and Steve is in the evening

[02:11:08.490 --> 02:11:14.290]
Maybe you need to check and see who's on duty on IOD from 10 to 2, somebody might have a phone patch over there

[02:11:14.290 --> 02:11:15.250]
Yeah, could be

[02:11:15.250 --> 02:11:15.690]
I mean, I don't know

[02:11:15.690 --> 02:11:19.330]
Well, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, maybe you need to check and see who's on duty on IOD from 10 to 2, somebody might have a phone patch over there

[02:11:19.330 --> 02:11:19.330]

[02:11:19.330 --> 02:11:19.930]
I'm just going to play a game tonight, right?

[02:11:20.290 --> 02:11:20.730]
What game?

[02:11:20.910 --> 02:11:23.790]
Are you going to watch a baseball game this afternoon?

[02:11:24.030 --> 02:11:29.370]
You all, if you get time, can you listen to Paul Lyle tonight, just 10 to 11, I thought you were going to be joking

[02:11:29.370 --> 02:11:32.510]
Paul Lyle, can I explain something to you?

[02:11:32.770 --> 02:11:41.970]
Paul Lyle used to be here during these hours briefly, and he was so bad that he was replaced by Bill McQuague who was a board op

[02:11:41.970 --> 02:11:46.410]
who had never done a, I'm not lying to you, who had never done a talk show in his life

[02:11:46.410 --> 02:11:48.830]
Well, that explains why he was replaced by Bill McQuague

[02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:59.210]
Who was also so bad that he was replaced by the Dean, and when you're replaced by the Dean, that's like, you know, that would be like George Bush being replaced by William McKinley, you know

[02:11:59.210 --> 02:12:00.490]
Well, he's doing pretty well over here, right?

[02:12:00.490 --> 02:12:01.290]
Well, he's not being all bad

[02:12:01.290 --> 02:12:07.050]
Considering that he's got five listeners who just call in alternately, you know, they take turns and call in and they disguise their voice

[02:12:07.050 --> 02:12:09.970]
Well, I have one thing to say to Paul Lyle

[02:12:09.970 --> 02:12:11.430]
I'm dying on my hands

[02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:16.910]
Yeah, now see, that's what he's getting, he gets the, not somebody called in the first time and he said, I'm dying over here, right?

[02:12:17.190 --> 02:12:22.090]
And he didn't do it right, so he says, now I'm a, I'm dying over here, Connistor, do it right, and he let him call

[02:12:22.090 --> 02:12:28.230]
Oh, this is the same guy who used to say on here, if it's the last thing I do, I'm getting Neil Rogers off the radio

[02:12:28.230 --> 02:12:34.130]
and he's the most disgusting douchebag that I've ever called, you are such a windbag and so full of crap

[02:12:34.130 --> 02:12:38.590]
and I hope you have a wonderful life over there with your 40 wants at night and your six listeners

[02:12:38.590 --> 02:12:43.430]
I mean, even Norman Kent was a genius in radio compared to that

[02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:44.710]
Oh, he's off the air now

[02:12:44.710 --> 02:12:47.630]
I know that he couldn't handle it anymore, too much pressure with that big audience

[02:12:47.630 --> 02:12:50.690]
You know who's taking his show to my dog, Paul Lyle

[02:12:50.690 --> 02:12:54.190]
No, in all seriousness, you know who's taking his show

[02:12:54.190 --> 02:12:54.870]
Sky

[02:12:54.870 --> 02:12:58.230]
No, me, you know who this is?

[02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.650]
Sky

[02:12:58.650 --> 02:12:59.910]
Yeah, it's tall

[02:13:04.150 --> 02:13:07.070]
Neil, you didn't go all this time and I did not know this was Charles

[02:13:07.070 --> 02:13:09.250]
What do you know if you had some kind of a brain transplant?

[02:13:09.470 --> 02:13:14.370]
No, no, I'm the same person, I just, I know when to be, to give you a fiery pour

[02:13:14.370 --> 02:13:23.850]
I have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to be sleeping late during the daytime

[02:13:23.850 --> 02:13:25.070]
like to least two

[02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:28.510]
But Neil, I promise I won't do anything from your show

[02:13:29.090 --> 02:13:30.850]
Let's see, that's the one thing I can give you that you know

[02:13:30.850 --> 02:13:32.730]
Oh, I think about your relapse Charles

[02:13:32.730 --> 02:13:34.810]
Oh, no, have a great day

[02:13:34.810 --> 02:13:35.450]
Okay, Neil

[02:13:35.450 --> 02:13:36.350]
Good luck to you, all right

[02:13:36.350 --> 02:13:36.870]
You'll need it

[02:13:37.870 --> 02:13:41.390]
137, oh my god, Charles, that's this kid, he's gonna be a talk host

[02:13:41.390 --> 02:13:44.190]
Anybody in the audience like to be a talk show host?

[02:13:44.550 --> 02:13:44.770]
Huh?

[02:13:45.530 --> 02:13:46.710]
Anybody have the 7-11?

[02:13:47.110 --> 02:13:48.750]
God, I don't know, Nick wants to do a show

[02:13:48.750 --> 02:13:50.550]
How much you do Saturday, 10-2?

[02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:53.910]
Could it be any worse than what it was a couple of weeks ago?

[02:13:54.710 --> 02:13:59.230]
Anyway, because I like that television myself, I don't want to start ripping him, we can't talk about him

[02:13:59.230 --> 02:14:01.410]
I would love to, God, but I love to rip him an ass

[02:14:01.410 --> 02:14:05.830]
It's 23-2 and, wouldn't you, wouldn't you like to rip him?

[02:14:05.850 --> 02:14:07.470]
You liked him, you loved the show

[02:14:07.470 --> 02:14:08.730]
You hated the show

[02:14:08.730 --> 02:14:10.050]
Nick liked everybody, but hey

[02:14:10.050 --> 02:14:13.310]
You hated that show, you hated coming in here setting up those chairs, don't kid me

[02:14:13.310 --> 02:14:16.310]
See, like, oh, Mr. Innocent, you know this?

[02:14:16.590 --> 02:14:18.330]
Got that little angelic look on his face

[02:14:18.330 --> 02:14:20.590]
Oh, I know nothing, we already know that

[02:14:21.410 --> 02:14:23.650]
Anyway, 23-2, golf stream

[02:14:23.650 --> 02:14:27.470]
Can't see really, he are bound

[02:14:28.030 --> 02:14:29.910]
Oh, what am I gonna do now?

[02:14:34.930 --> 02:14:35.650]
Playing video

[02:14:40.250 --> 02:14:43.250]
So, where I didn't hear from oh, theuito, I ain't sure who you're not hearing it.

[02:14:43.410 --> 02:14:45.050]
So I will, go after, he's it

[02:15:03.010 --> 02:15:04.030]
Take a letter.

[02:15:04.590 --> 02:15:05.430]
Yes, Mr. Brown.

[02:15:06.230 --> 02:15:07.910]
I need ten copies.

[02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:09.170]
Ten copies.

[02:15:09.850 --> 02:15:10.870]
Right away, Mr. Brown.

[02:15:11.350 --> 02:15:12.430]
Where's that mamma?

[02:15:12.970 --> 02:15:13.750]
Here, here.

[02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.850]
Hello.

[02:15:14.150 --> 02:15:14.150]

[02:15:14.510 --> 02:15:15.030]
Take a letter.

[02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.030]

[02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.030]

[02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.030]

[02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.030]

[02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:16.130]
MMO, MMO!

[02:15:16.970 --> 02:15:18.090]
I'll do this.

[02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:21.010]
Take a letter. Where's my coffee?

[02:15:23.370 --> 02:15:24.550]
Stop it, Mr. Brown.

[02:15:24.990 --> 02:15:25.350]
Hey, man.

[02:15:26.350 --> 02:15:27.490]
141 in WID.

[02:15:27.670 --> 02:15:30.750]
I figure if I can stay a day ahead of Rick and Puts, then I'll be safe.

[02:15:31.010 --> 02:15:33.590]
Just keep carting up new material and I'll never catch up.

[02:15:34.070 --> 02:15:34.410]
Miami.

[02:15:34.990 --> 02:15:36.030]
Miami, Neil.

[02:15:36.230 --> 02:15:36.730]
When is this?

[02:15:37.110 --> 02:15:38.530]
Congratulations to you, Neil.

[02:15:38.970 --> 02:15:39.150]
Four.

[02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:42.990]
For a little strike at zero even with Columbia National Team yesterday,

[02:15:42.990 --> 02:15:44.170]
they naïve the orange roll.

[02:15:44.250 --> 02:15:44.470]
Yes.

[02:15:44.750 --> 02:15:45.350]
Great game.

[02:15:45.750 --> 02:15:46.210]
All right.

[02:15:46.410 --> 02:15:47.530]
Hope we all enjoy it.

[02:15:48.550 --> 02:15:49.670]
And how about those cubs?

[02:15:50.630 --> 02:15:51.090]
What cup?

[02:15:51.590 --> 02:15:51.770]
Yeah.

[02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:53.530]
Mr. Mayor?

[02:15:53.830 --> 02:15:54.150]
Yes.

[02:15:54.590 --> 02:15:58.570]
Mr. Mayor, you are the most entertaining voice on the AM radio ever.

[02:15:58.950 --> 02:15:59.150]
Yes.

[02:15:59.510 --> 02:16:02.090]
Don, listen to this, more on the call you.

[02:16:02.290 --> 02:16:02.570]
Exactly.

[02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:05.130]
Okay. I get a little trivia for you.

[02:16:05.130 --> 02:16:05.790]
You have a little what?

[02:16:06.350 --> 02:16:07.030]
Little trivia.

[02:16:07.130 --> 02:16:08.490]
Oh, I thought you said something personal.

[02:16:08.670 --> 02:16:08.970]
Go ahead.

[02:16:09.250 --> 02:16:10.010]
Why do you sit?

[02:16:10.010 --> 02:16:11.370]
It weighs...

[02:16:11.370 --> 02:16:12.010]
Where do you sit?

[02:16:12.090 --> 02:16:12.870]
On 76.

[02:16:14.090 --> 02:16:15.270]
Well, no way in the corner.

[02:16:15.710 --> 02:16:16.630]
Can you understand what he's saying?

[02:16:16.990 --> 02:16:17.670]
What is it?

[02:16:17.770 --> 02:16:17.890]
What?

[02:16:18.750 --> 02:16:20.010]
It weighs 176.

[02:16:21.090 --> 02:16:22.010]
No, one on 76.

[02:16:23.390 --> 02:16:23.650]
Yeah.

[02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:25.350]
220 calories.

[02:16:26.110 --> 02:16:27.130]
8 grams fat.

[02:16:28.710 --> 02:16:30.210]
150 milligrams sodium.

[02:16:31.150 --> 02:16:36.070]
70 sweet chocolate corn syrup, sugar, milk, soybean oil, butter, salt, egg whites.

[02:16:36.370 --> 02:16:36.750]
What is it?

[02:16:36.970 --> 02:16:37.750]
That's a candy bar.

[02:16:37.750 --> 02:16:39.870]
What kind?

[02:16:40.210 --> 02:16:41.190]
A Milky Way Dark.

[02:16:41.450 --> 02:16:41.830]
Right.

[02:16:42.210 --> 02:16:43.210]
Oh, God.

[02:16:43.530 --> 02:16:46.050]
Find it at the radison by the airport.

[02:16:46.690 --> 02:16:47.030]
Great.

[02:16:47.610 --> 02:16:49.150]
Rip off 83 cents.

[02:16:49.430 --> 02:16:53.090]
Well, I want to thank the staff around here for leaving me an empty box.

[02:16:53.430 --> 02:16:57.290]
Publix sent over a box of Milky Way Darks.

[02:16:57.790 --> 02:17:01.430]
And the empty box was left in my mailbox.

[02:17:01.630 --> 02:17:02.150]
Well, that's good.

[02:17:02.250 --> 02:17:03.030]
It's a band for you.

[02:17:03.150 --> 02:17:03.350]
Okay.

[02:17:03.530 --> 02:17:04.130]
Cut the cramp.

[02:17:04.510 --> 02:17:04.810]
You're right.

[02:17:04.810 --> 02:17:06.370]
Well, listen, have a wonderful life.

[02:17:06.450 --> 02:17:08.530]
We meet you in May or we listen to you.

[02:17:08.630 --> 02:17:10.990]
Beyond tomorrow night and then most of next week.

[02:17:11.130 --> 02:17:11.710]
We hope so.

[02:17:11.770 --> 02:17:12.090]
Okay.

[02:17:12.330 --> 02:17:12.670]
Bye-bye.

[02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:14.610]
The one thing I didn't check those the hurricanes.

[02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:17.110]
Are they starting in the playoffs?

[02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:17.290]
Oh, yeah.

[02:17:17.410 --> 02:17:20.410]
We got the plan as a matter of fact Friday, I think, isn't it?

[02:17:20.470 --> 02:17:20.910]
Let's see.

[02:17:22.390 --> 02:17:22.790]
Sometimes.

[02:17:23.510 --> 02:17:24.750]
I know it's this weekend.

[02:17:24.750 --> 02:17:27.830]
I'm not exactly sure which day it is, but that's coming up very soon.

[02:17:27.970 --> 02:17:28.810]
So they may...

[02:17:29.350 --> 02:17:32.870]
I guess it comes down to either carrying the hurricanes or the Yankees.

[02:17:33.170 --> 02:17:33.850]
There's no choice.

[02:17:33.850 --> 02:17:37.030]
Well, the point is when they're in a tournament, obviously we're going to carry the hurricane.

[02:17:37.070 --> 02:17:37.470]
Yeah.

[02:17:37.550 --> 02:17:38.990]
Because somebody might be interested in that.

[02:17:39.890 --> 02:17:40.290]
144.

[02:17:40.770 --> 02:17:41.210]
Now, what is that?

[02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:42.750]
Would I like to read the Dick Pertin letter?

[02:17:43.490 --> 02:17:45.210]
Nick, what is that about?

[02:17:45.370 --> 02:17:46.810]
Who wants me to read the Dick Pertin letter?

[02:17:47.070 --> 02:17:47.950]
It's just a short note.

[02:17:48.050 --> 02:17:50.190]
It's not like a big somebody from Detroit.

[02:17:50.730 --> 02:17:51.630]
Oh, excuse me.

[02:17:53.310 --> 02:17:54.110]
Kathy asked.

[02:17:54.590 --> 02:17:55.090]
Kathy, who?

[02:17:57.230 --> 02:17:57.930]
Kathy's clown.

[02:17:58.430 --> 02:17:58.790]
Oh, yeah.

[02:17:58.810 --> 02:18:03.330]
Well, it says, Neo, while vacationing in my place on Marco Island last week and part of this week,

[02:18:03.330 --> 02:18:05.930]
I heard your return show and loved it.

[02:18:06.610 --> 02:18:07.170]
Incredible stuff.

[02:18:07.350 --> 02:18:09.410]
The Alex Bennett saga was better than fiction.

[02:18:09.630 --> 02:18:12.870]
Best wishes for a full and speedy recovery, Dick Pertin.

[02:18:13.230 --> 02:18:14.490]
Good morning, Mr. Pertin.

[02:18:14.610 --> 02:18:14.870]
Oh, dear.

[02:18:15.210 --> 02:18:17.930]
This is Mr. Rogers with another word for the day.

[02:18:18.090 --> 02:18:18.810]
Good morning, Mr. Rogers.

[02:18:19.230 --> 02:18:20.750]
And what is your word for today?

[02:18:21.330 --> 02:18:23.530]
My word for the day is linger a.

[02:18:25.730 --> 02:18:30.370]
Mr. Rogers, I think the word you're talking about is linger a.

[02:18:31.630 --> 02:18:31.990]
What?

[02:18:33.410 --> 02:18:33.970]
Get me.

[02:18:36.110 --> 02:18:36.810]
Get me.

[02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:38.410]
Can't you tie your choke up, Mr. Rogers?

[02:18:38.610 --> 02:18:39.330]
I know what it means.

[02:18:39.470 --> 02:18:41.650]
It means nightgowns and sexy underwear.

[02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:43.030]
Yes.

[02:18:43.830 --> 02:18:44.510]
You know what, Roger?

[02:18:44.670 --> 02:18:47.490]
I'm getting pretty sick of you coming up with disgusting words of the day.

[02:18:47.590 --> 02:18:49.870]
I mean, that's nothing wrong with that, but the way you do it.

[02:18:49.970 --> 02:18:51.610]
You know, one day you had fetish.

[02:18:51.950 --> 02:18:53.470]
Today you've got linger a.

[02:18:53.790 --> 02:18:54.730]
Oh, dear neighbor.

[02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:56.230]
I think you've made a mistake.

[02:18:56.570 --> 02:18:56.630]
What?

[02:18:56.730 --> 02:18:58.090]
I said linger a.

[02:18:59.030 --> 02:18:59.950]
You mispronounced it.

[02:18:59.950 --> 02:19:01.330]
I don't think so, neighbor.

[02:19:01.670 --> 02:19:03.490]
Let me use my word in a sentence.

[02:19:03.710 --> 02:19:04.150]
Okay, good.

[02:19:04.730 --> 02:19:08.450]
After we go shopping in Windsor, let's stop for a warm beverage.

[02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:10.230]
We don't have to go right back.

[02:19:10.670 --> 02:19:11.710]
We can linger a.

[02:19:14.350 --> 02:19:15.470]
I see, Mr. Rogers.

[02:19:16.010 --> 02:19:16.630]
I'm sorry.

[02:19:17.130 --> 02:19:18.270]
Sorry, I misunderstood.

[02:19:18.850 --> 02:19:20.250]
You're obvious good intention.

[02:19:20.570 --> 02:19:21.090]
Sure you did.

[02:19:21.670 --> 02:19:26.350]
And while we're lingering over our beverage, maybe we can talk one of the girls and do a table dance.

[02:19:26.430 --> 02:19:28.530]
Mr. Rogers, I think it goes to charity.

[02:19:28.530 --> 02:19:29.710]
Good bye, Mr. Rogers.

[02:19:29.970 --> 02:19:31.730]
Can you say Bonjour Monique?

[02:19:33.770 --> 02:19:34.650]
Okay, 146.

[02:19:34.710 --> 02:19:36.230]
One of the funniest people in the world.

[02:19:36.410 --> 02:19:40.910]
So to get that letter from Dick Pertin, and just made my day and my week, and not so negative,

[02:19:41.090 --> 02:19:41.930]
is I usually am in depressing.

[02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.550]
Sunrise.

[02:19:44.310 --> 02:19:44.670]
Hi.

[02:19:45.010 --> 02:19:45.210]
Hi.

[02:19:45.490 --> 02:19:45.730]
Mail?

[02:19:46.010 --> 02:19:46.210]
Yes.

[02:19:47.310 --> 02:19:49.890]
You should have heard that I'm searching last night.

[02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:51.130]
My first time calling.

[02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.670]
Who?

[02:19:51.770 --> 02:19:51.970]
Who is it?

[02:19:52.390 --> 02:19:52.990]
I'm searching.

[02:19:53.230 --> 02:19:53.650]
Who's that?

[02:19:54.270 --> 02:19:56.170]
Oh, the guy with the socks in the toilet paper.

[02:19:56.170 --> 02:19:56.750]
Yeah.

[02:19:56.950 --> 02:20:05.370]
Well, last night he had a doctor fish came on talking about, you shouldn't go fishing to

[02:20:05.370 --> 02:20:07.450]
hurt the short little fish in water.

[02:20:07.650 --> 02:20:08.970]
Oh, that's a good subject, yeah.

[02:20:09.170 --> 02:20:10.150]
And then when he came.

[02:20:10.290 --> 02:20:12.370]
I bet you got hooked on that show, so to speak.

[02:20:12.610 --> 02:20:19.210]
And then he said, and if you want more information, call this number 1-800-Rupper.

[02:20:20.010 --> 02:20:22.790]
So, what made you call that number?

[02:20:23.370 --> 02:20:27.990]
And he called earning back and he said, hey, you gave me this number to call.

[02:20:28.510 --> 02:20:30.170]
He said, guess who I got on the phone?

[02:20:30.990 --> 02:20:34.650]
He says, that was Neil Rogers.

[02:20:34.830 --> 02:20:35.490]
Oh, yeah, all right.

[02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:40.070]
So everybody's called that number and it's going to be your number.

[02:20:40.170 --> 02:20:40.910]
Oh, I don't think so.

[02:20:41.450 --> 02:20:42.870]
No, as a matter of fact, that must be a follow-up.

[02:20:42.950 --> 02:20:46.670]
Because last week he did a show on fish excrement.

[02:20:46.670 --> 02:20:49.130]
And the toll free number was like 1-800-Bashturn.

[02:20:50.770 --> 02:20:52.590]
And I thought it was a pretty poor taste.

[02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:54.670]
Oh, he's getting awful.

[02:20:54.750 --> 02:20:55.810]
He said that on the radio.

[02:20:56.130 --> 02:20:56.530]
What?

[02:20:57.350 --> 02:20:57.690]
Why not?

[02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:58.890]
You can say bastard on the air.

[02:20:59.510 --> 02:21:01.350]
He's scraping the bottom of the barrel, you know?

[02:21:01.710 --> 02:21:06.070]
And then he's still got that little pre-pubescent squeaky kid on with him, that kid's guy.

[02:21:06.470 --> 02:21:08.510]
He sounds like he's going to fly away any second.

[02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:12.610]
And somebody called him and said, it's turning into like a little kid station over there.

[02:21:12.690 --> 02:21:15.570]
They got all these little, I mean, Charles is working there.

[02:21:15.570 --> 02:21:20.710]
And pretty soon, the kid that just called a little while ago, he was a 17-year-old kid, a groupie.

[02:21:21.170 --> 02:21:22.370]
I never heard no Charles.

[02:21:22.610 --> 02:21:24.390]
Well, I'll tell you pretty soon he'll be the manager.

[02:21:24.490 --> 02:21:26.690]
And they can call a show Charles and Charles over there.

[02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:27.270]
It's going to be...

[02:21:27.270 --> 02:21:28.810]
They better get rid of that program director.

[02:21:29.150 --> 02:21:29.710]
You bet.

[02:21:30.250 --> 02:21:30.910]
Okay, Neil.

[02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:32.170]
Keep well.

[02:21:32.330 --> 02:21:33.930]
I hear a lot of rumors about that place.

[02:21:34.470 --> 02:21:35.010]
Oh, my.

[02:21:35.210 --> 02:21:35.810]
Have a great day.

[02:21:36.190 --> 02:21:37.150]
Say hi to Ernie.

[02:21:37.550 --> 02:21:38.370]
You too, I'm going to tell you.

[02:21:38.670 --> 02:21:40.950]
Give him a little sharman, because he could sure use it on that show.

[02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:43.050]
148 at WIOD.

[02:21:43.170 --> 02:21:44.830]
Felt like a pretty damn uplifting day.

[02:21:44.910 --> 02:21:46.050]
Little Joyce says hello.

[02:21:46.370 --> 02:21:47.070]
Sky was here.

[02:21:47.070 --> 02:21:47.810]
What did a job?

[02:21:47.850 --> 02:21:48.650]
Are you serious?

[02:21:48.870 --> 02:21:49.370]
What is he about?

[02:21:49.410 --> 02:21:50.210]
Like nine years old?

[02:21:50.670 --> 02:21:51.590]
Have you ever heard that?

[02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:53.130]
He makes...

[02:21:53.130 --> 02:21:55.250]
I be babbling sound like...

[02:21:56.490 --> 02:21:57.270]
Connie Chung.

[02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:58.490]
I mean, just ridiculous.

[02:21:59.210 --> 02:21:59.650]
Miami.

[02:22:00.510 --> 02:22:01.130]
I don't know.

[02:22:01.370 --> 02:22:01.790]
Okay.

[02:22:02.130 --> 02:22:03.490]
Hey, why are you saying, John?

[02:22:04.150 --> 02:22:07.370]
A 97-year-old, you're happy, Wayne.

[02:22:07.810 --> 02:22:08.090]
Yeah.

[02:22:08.310 --> 02:22:09.530]
Are you for that now?

[02:22:10.050 --> 02:22:11.330]
Happy, happy music.

[02:22:11.450 --> 02:22:13.710]
That's the Ron Juniors nephew.

[02:22:14.550 --> 02:22:16.050]
We're going to have any...

[02:22:16.050 --> 02:22:17.070]
Ron St. John the Third.

[02:22:17.410 --> 02:22:18.130]
We know what you want.

[02:22:18.250 --> 02:22:19.710]
You want the Ohio X.

[02:22:20.270 --> 02:22:20.570]
Right.

[02:22:22.250 --> 02:22:22.910]
We're listening.

[02:22:23.930 --> 02:22:25.030]
What he's even got it.

[02:22:30.250 --> 02:22:30.590]
Yeah.

[02:22:30.690 --> 02:22:33.010]
Why the hell was Ron St. John today, by the way, Jr.?

[02:22:33.010 --> 02:22:34.650]
I mean, this is the nephew, but where is the real one?

[02:22:34.650 --> 02:22:35.490]
Yeah, I'm really disappointed.

[02:22:35.570 --> 02:22:38.550]
What are you going through those carts in Iraq for, there, Riley?

[02:22:39.230 --> 02:22:39.590]
Riley?

[02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:42.270]
Get your hands off our crap.

[02:22:42.750 --> 02:22:43.110]
Okay.

[02:22:44.130 --> 02:22:45.250]
Get off our stuff.

[02:22:46.310 --> 02:22:47.610]
You can do whatever it had you want.

[02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:48.070]
We don't care.

[02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:51.490]
But cut those damn callers out.

[02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:53.870]
I'll tell you that, or I'll do four hours on you guys tomorrow.

[02:22:54.650 --> 02:22:55.250]
I know you wish.

[02:22:56.110 --> 02:22:57.090]
Which one did I punch?

[02:22:57.610 --> 02:22:58.350]
Let me do that again.

[02:22:58.850 --> 02:22:59.210]
Miami.

[02:22:59.630 --> 02:22:59.910]
You.

[02:23:00.310 --> 02:23:00.610]
You.

[02:23:00.890 --> 02:23:01.510]
Aren't you lucky?

[02:23:01.650 --> 02:23:02.530]
I almost punched you out.

[02:23:02.730 --> 02:23:04.710]
Thirty minutes on hold and still hold.

[02:23:04.850 --> 02:23:05.750]
Isn't that what that guy wanted to do?

[02:23:05.790 --> 02:23:06.470]
Do you punch you out?

[02:23:08.370 --> 02:23:09.010]
No, I don't.

[02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.910]
I don't know.

[02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:18.370]
I don't know.

[02:23:19.850 --> 02:23:20.330]
I don't know.

[02:23:21.110 --> 02:23:21.490]
I don't know.

[02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:22.610]
I don't know.

[02:23:23.070 --> 02:23:23.750]
I don't know.

[02:23:23.770 --> 02:23:25.150]
I don't know.

[02:23:25.150 --> 02:23:25.510]
I don't know.

[02:23:25.690 --> 02:23:26.030]
I don't know.

[02:23:26.030 --> 02:23:26.450]
I don't know.

[02:23:26.450 --> 02:23:26.910]
I don't know.

[02:23:26.910 --> 02:23:26.910]

[02:23:26.910 --> 02:23:26.910]

[02:23:27.010 --> 02:23:27.010]

[02:23:27.010 --> 02:23:27.550]
I don't know.

[02:23:27.730 --> 02:23:27.950]
I don't know.

[02:23:28.970 --> 02:23:28.970]

[02:23:28.970 --> 02:23:28.970]

[02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:30.230]
I don't know.

[02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.310]
I don't know.

[02:23:30.610 --> 02:23:30.850]
I don't know.

[02:23:30.850 --> 02:23:31.410]
I don't know.

[02:23:31.610 --> 02:23:32.610]
I don't know.

[02:23:32.810 --> 02:23:33.070]
I don't know.

[02:23:33.070 --> 02:23:33.650]
I don't know.

[02:23:33.870 --> 02:23:34.570]
I don't know.

[02:23:35.450 --> 02:23:35.610]
I don't know.

[02:23:35.930 --> 02:23:36.430]
I don't know.

[02:23:36.430 --> 02:23:37.990]
Where's all those pinheads, man?

[02:23:38.190 --> 02:23:41.870]
Where are all those people that those loyal listeners that should be calling like Joe with six

[02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:44.490]
ends and Eric and Tim and this one and that?

[02:23:44.750 --> 02:23:45.590]
Where the hell are they?

[02:23:45.890 --> 02:23:47.030]
They're probably all in bed.

[02:23:47.490 --> 02:23:48.090]
With each other.

[02:23:48.170 --> 02:23:48.970]
I think so.

[02:23:48.990 --> 02:23:49.330]
Probably.

[02:23:50.330 --> 02:23:51.670]
Well, I'd pay to watch that.

[02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:52.350]
Yeah, me too.

[02:23:52.690 --> 02:23:53.070]
I'll bet.

[02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:54.210]
So what's stando in there?

[02:23:54.350 --> 02:23:55.770]
Stand is the smoke in the room.

[02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:59.890]
Just the disgusting elephant supository cigars that he smokes, disgusting.

[02:24:00.430 --> 02:24:01.930]
Hey Stan, I got one question for you.

[02:24:02.090 --> 02:24:02.230]
Yeah.

[02:24:02.470 --> 02:24:04.210]
Why are they going to get rid of this lousy baseball?

[02:24:04.530 --> 02:24:04.810]
Exactly.

[02:24:04.810 --> 02:24:05.770]
What can I tell you?

[02:24:06.090 --> 02:24:07.750]
I mean, he doesn't want to answer the question.

[02:24:07.750 --> 02:24:09.150]
He's trying to stay on the good side.

[02:24:09.150 --> 02:24:10.890]
Little does he realize that they lie a lot.

[02:24:10.950 --> 02:24:12.450]
Well, let's just start slapping him around a little.

[02:24:12.550 --> 02:24:12.890]
Exactly.

[02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:15.250]
Slap that those two around.

[02:24:15.450 --> 02:24:16.530]
The evil twins in there.

[02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:17.710]
Yeah, that's Tom Denenberg.

[02:24:17.830 --> 02:24:18.570]
What an asshole.

[02:24:18.670 --> 02:24:19.010]
Exactly.

[02:24:19.710 --> 02:24:20.670]
Number one in our book.

[02:24:20.850 --> 02:24:21.170]
Definitely.

[02:24:21.370 --> 02:24:21.850]
Don't knock him.

[02:24:21.870 --> 02:24:22.590]
He sells my show.

[02:24:22.730 --> 02:24:23.170]
He's great.

[02:24:23.390 --> 02:24:23.730]
He is.

[02:24:23.830 --> 02:24:24.890]
He's the only salesman we got.

[02:24:25.390 --> 02:24:26.290]
Have a great life.

[02:24:26.670 --> 02:24:27.250]
You too, Neil.

[02:24:27.350 --> 02:24:29.130]
See, as they say in the afternoon, have a great life.

[02:24:29.230 --> 02:24:29.850]
Oh, excuse me.

[02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:31.630]
154.

[02:24:32.210 --> 02:24:33.870]
Say don't mess with me with those suit.

[02:24:33.870 --> 02:24:36.750]
You don't remember the caller I'm talking about from Coral Springs.

[02:24:36.750 --> 02:24:42.090]
He said he was your contract man or something like that.

[02:24:42.130 --> 02:24:43.610]
You keep calling them contract man.

[02:24:43.750 --> 02:24:44.770]
You don't remember that call?

[02:24:45.890 --> 02:24:47.110]
They all played in.

[02:24:47.290 --> 02:24:47.770]
Oh, man.

[02:24:48.030 --> 02:24:50.350]
He's got the correct central man.

[02:24:50.350 --> 02:24:53.730]
He leaves it here with a thing though because he leaves it here.

[02:24:53.850 --> 02:24:55.350]
He's been on it for half weeks and he already forgot him all.

[02:24:55.410 --> 02:24:56.230]
That's that's great.

[02:24:56.230 --> 02:24:57.870]
It took me 10 years to do that.

[02:24:57.930 --> 02:24:58.190]
That's it.

[02:24:58.850 --> 02:25:02.410]
And Neil, do you remember the card I sent you four years ago from Delaware?

[02:25:02.790 --> 02:25:02.790]

[02:25:02.790 --> 02:25:03.770]
I mean, get serious.

[02:25:04.010 --> 02:25:07.470]
Okay, I can't remember what that'll happen to you yesterday, which is probably why I feel so good.

[02:25:07.890 --> 02:25:08.630]
W-I-O-D.

[02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:09.270]
Hi, Neil.

[02:25:09.410 --> 02:25:09.770]
How's it going?

[02:25:09.870 --> 02:25:11.150]
Okay, how come I punched you up?

[02:25:11.410 --> 02:25:13.150]
I don't know, but you did a good job.

[02:25:13.390 --> 02:25:16.450]
All these other people are waiting and waiting and I punch you up cold.

[02:25:16.850 --> 02:25:17.790]
Don't you feel guilty?

[02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.790]
No, I don't.

[02:25:19.710 --> 02:25:21.470]
Like I said, I had a feeling with you.

[02:25:21.770 --> 02:25:22.750]
I'll let that go.

[02:25:23.330 --> 02:25:24.610]
I'm not letting that go.

[02:25:25.510 --> 02:25:26.050]
Good bad.

[02:25:26.190 --> 02:25:26.650]
That's a bad call.

[02:25:26.650 --> 02:25:27.930]
I can see if they let it go.

[02:25:28.530 --> 02:25:28.890]
No.

[02:25:29.170 --> 02:25:29.810]
No way.

[02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:29.910]

[02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:31.690]
Are you nuts?

[02:25:33.470 --> 02:25:34.710]
Rick would have left it on the air.

[02:25:34.810 --> 02:25:35.270]
Yeah, I'll bet.

[02:25:35.410 --> 02:25:36.470]
I want to let it on the air.

[02:25:36.470 --> 02:25:37.570]
That's why I'll be lucky to make three weeks.

[02:25:37.590 --> 02:25:39.110]
You wouldn't let him in the show with that hairdo.

[02:25:39.210 --> 02:25:40.310]
Oh, yeah, right.

[02:25:40.310 --> 02:25:43.130]
I don't want to hear any more tacky arsonial nails jokes.

[02:25:43.270 --> 02:25:43.590]
Okay.

[02:25:43.950 --> 02:25:48.070]
Just because he looks like he got off the spaceship from Uranus, don't the bunny.

[02:25:48.330 --> 02:25:49.530]
Okay, what a putz.

[02:25:50.270 --> 02:25:50.590]
Heartland.

[02:25:52.030 --> 02:25:54.490]
Boy, how they old have returned to the roost.

[02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:55.090]
Yes, sir.

[02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.690]
How you doing?

[02:25:55.910 --> 02:25:56.230]
Okay.

[02:25:56.570 --> 02:25:58.270]
That was a great interview last night.

[02:25:58.310 --> 02:25:59.690]
Yeah, well, it's not dwell on him.

[02:25:59.690 --> 02:25:59.970]
Okay.

[02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:01.950]
That's what he said, too.

[02:26:02.050 --> 02:26:03.090]
That was a great call, right?

[02:26:03.530 --> 02:26:04.570]
That's not hop on it.

[02:26:04.630 --> 02:26:05.370]
That's what he said.

[02:26:05.430 --> 02:26:06.190]
He said, well, why not?

[02:26:06.350 --> 02:26:09.550]
Yeah, he's got to be the horniest guy who's ever been on TV.

[02:26:09.810 --> 02:26:11.410]
Listen, Shia did him last night.

[02:26:11.430 --> 02:26:13.970]
Anything that's moving, man, he wants to hop right on it.

[02:26:14.110 --> 02:26:14.910]
I'm telling you.

[02:26:15.290 --> 02:26:16.850]
Hey, I got a lot for the derby.

[02:26:17.070 --> 02:26:18.310]
A lot for the perfect bet.

[02:26:18.350 --> 02:26:19.250]
Okay, Northern Wolf.

[02:26:19.770 --> 02:26:21.010]
Mr. Fiskie.

[02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:22.230]
An unbridled.

[02:26:22.690 --> 02:26:23.370]
Unbridled, you like?

[02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:24.010]
Yeah.

[02:26:24.330 --> 02:26:25.070]
He's got a shot.

[02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:27.050]
At least you didn't pick Pad Day anyway.

[02:26:27.890 --> 02:26:29.150]
Get him out of there.

[02:26:29.430 --> 02:26:29.590]
Yeah.

[02:26:29.830 --> 02:26:31.010]
Get him back to the barn.

[02:26:31.330 --> 02:26:32.270]
So you're going on a car?

[02:26:32.490 --> 02:26:33.610]
I'm feeling real good today.

[02:26:33.810 --> 02:26:37.110]
I shouldn't say this because then I'll come back to haunt me.

[02:26:37.730 --> 02:26:42.350]
But the best today that I have of any day I've been back at the end of the show after the four hours, you know, not too bad.

[02:26:42.670 --> 02:26:43.130]
That's good.

[02:26:43.450 --> 02:26:44.710]
Like I could do another four hours.

[02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:46.050]
Yeah, I just heard about it.

[02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:47.050]
About what?

[02:26:47.570 --> 02:26:48.510]
About your...

[02:26:48.510 --> 02:26:48.830]
Stroke?

[02:26:48.850 --> 02:26:49.090]
Yeah.

[02:26:49.390 --> 02:26:51.110]
Not my thing, about my stroke.

[02:26:51.210 --> 02:26:52.710]
Well, the same thing.

[02:26:52.970 --> 02:26:53.230]
Well,

[02:26:54.110 --> 02:26:54.910]
stroke, right?

[02:26:54.910 --> 02:26:55.970]
Not in this case.

[02:26:56.110 --> 02:26:57.510]
Not that kind of stroke.

[02:26:58.430 --> 02:26:58.790]
Hahahaha.

[02:26:59.810 --> 02:27:01.170]
Pertin was talking about you.

[02:27:01.350 --> 02:27:01.930]
Come on.

[02:27:02.050 --> 02:27:02.730]
Yeah, I'm serious.

[02:27:03.290 --> 02:27:04.830]
Did you hear me read the letter I just got?

[02:27:05.110 --> 02:27:05.290]
No.

[02:27:05.730 --> 02:27:06.030]
What letter?

[02:27:06.110 --> 02:27:06.910]
He sent me a nice letter.

[02:27:06.910 --> 02:27:08.070]
I just read it on the air.

[02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:09.390]
He was over in Marco.

[02:27:09.570 --> 02:27:12.270]
He's got a place in Marco where he goes on vacation and he listens over there.

[02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:14.050]
He was a big fan of him.

[02:27:14.050 --> 02:27:14.690]
What did he say?

[02:27:15.130 --> 02:27:18.910]
He just said, you know, he was talking about the big top of...

[02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:20.270]
Top show host down in Florida.

[02:27:20.530 --> 02:27:21.210]
And I said, well,

[02:27:21.870 --> 02:27:25.790]
you know, he didn't mention a name for a long time and then about five minutes later he did.

[02:27:26.050 --> 02:27:26.270]
Yeah.

[02:27:26.570 --> 02:27:28.330]
And he just said, he holds your phone better.

[02:27:28.770 --> 02:27:30.670]
Yeah, I'm going to send him a note back.

[02:27:30.830 --> 02:27:31.630]
He's a great guy.

[02:27:31.870 --> 02:27:33.150]
And funny, funny as hell.

[02:27:33.270 --> 02:27:34.170]
I mean, he's just tremendous.

[02:27:34.430 --> 02:27:35.530]
Yeah, he killed him up there.

[02:27:35.550 --> 02:27:35.910]
You bet.

[02:27:36.170 --> 02:27:36.550]
All right.

[02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:40.270]
Now, he's going to be funny too before I got so depressing and negative, you know.

[02:27:40.650 --> 02:27:42.050]
What do you think about the dirt we don't really?

[02:27:42.330 --> 02:27:43.590]
I like Mr. Frisky.

[02:27:43.650 --> 02:27:44.130]
I don't...

[02:27:44.130 --> 02:27:45.150]
I'm not going to bet on it.

[02:27:45.350 --> 02:27:46.750]
Although I may go out there Saturday.

[02:27:46.930 --> 02:27:47.710]
I'm feeling pretty good.

[02:27:47.770 --> 02:27:51.190]
I may go out to Calder with the bill who owns a track and just pulling down the track.

[02:27:52.050 --> 02:27:52.770]
I'm serious.

[02:27:53.910 --> 02:27:55.090]
He's coming along real good.

[02:27:55.390 --> 02:27:58.390]
We'll have him on a show in a few days when he gets courage.

[02:27:58.670 --> 02:27:59.350]
Well, I'll call back.

[02:27:59.550 --> 02:28:00.090]
He'll tell me when.

[02:28:00.430 --> 02:28:00.690]
Okay.

[02:28:01.050 --> 02:28:01.410]
All right.

[02:28:01.630 --> 02:28:02.290]
See you anytime.

[02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:04.610]
158 at WIOD.

[02:28:04.710 --> 02:28:05.230]
How do you like that?

[02:28:05.310 --> 02:28:06.410]
He's even talking about me on here.

[02:28:06.430 --> 02:28:07.550]
What if he got a job up there?

[02:28:07.590 --> 02:28:08.730]
Ooh, I hate to hear that.

[02:28:08.730 --> 02:28:10.010]
Well, what was going on around here?

[02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:12.350]
Probably got a week's worth of material.

[02:28:12.830 --> 02:28:13.010]
Yeah.

[02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:18.310]
Yeah, because I came back and all this crazy psychotic stuff had gone on.

[02:28:19.050 --> 02:28:21.670]
And then that article in the paper and it's like Mr.

[02:28:22.170 --> 02:28:24.050]
the guy who disappeared his name we can't match.

[02:28:24.050 --> 02:28:24.590]
You know, I'll explain.

[02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:25.450]
He's blaming me.

[02:28:25.570 --> 02:28:26.310]
I wasn't even here.

[02:28:27.230 --> 02:28:29.110]
And he called me on the phone in the hospital.

[02:28:29.270 --> 02:28:30.010]
He called me at home.

[02:28:30.110 --> 02:28:31.370]
Oh, we can't wait for your back.

[02:28:31.690 --> 02:28:32.950]
We just have to have you back.

[02:28:33.390 --> 02:28:35.270]
All friendly, loving and wonderful.

[02:28:35.490 --> 02:28:36.970]
And then he goes in the paper and rips me.

[02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:40.450]
And like everything's a one man station and Neil can't stand anybody's a threat to him.

[02:28:40.850 --> 02:28:42.170]
Well, that's your wouldn't include him.

[02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:44.610]
Anyway, what is that?

[02:28:44.850 --> 02:28:45.210]
Croc?

[02:28:45.350 --> 02:28:46.030]
What is that?

[02:28:46.110 --> 02:28:46.330]
Hello.

[02:28:46.330 --> 02:28:47.430]
Good day, Neil.

[02:28:47.650 --> 02:28:48.010]
Yes.

[02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:50.070]
I'm glad that you're feeling better.

[02:28:50.650 --> 02:28:52.490]
What is that CROC?

[02:28:52.870 --> 02:28:54.090]
Croc and I all done me.

[02:28:54.170 --> 02:28:56.750]
Oh my God, if I didn't know that, I didn't say no.

[02:28:56.930 --> 02:28:56.930]

[02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.110]

[02:28:57.570 --> 02:28:59.330]
Every time I wanted to call, every time I wanted to call, I didn't see anything.

[02:28:59.330 --> 02:29:02.970]
Well, when we hear these people start calling in, then you know we really have done it.

[02:29:02.970 --> 02:29:03.450]
I haven't cut me off.

[02:29:03.450 --> 02:29:04.450]
We've got a whole audience away.

[02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:08.750]
Anyway, I call up when I just, I know you would never let me through to tell you that I,

[02:29:08.830 --> 02:29:10.890]
I listen and I'm glad that you're all right.

[02:29:11.030 --> 02:29:11.910]
Well, thank you, Croc.

[02:29:11.970 --> 02:29:16.050]
And by the way, when you said bastard before, that's the name of my bastard.

[02:29:16.590 --> 02:29:16.910]
Really?

[02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:17.710]
There's a bastard.

[02:29:17.890 --> 02:29:18.250]
We're in there.

[02:29:18.330 --> 02:29:20.810]
He's got a picture of it around there somewhere, a Senate to him.

[02:29:20.970 --> 02:29:21.290]
Okay.

[02:29:22.210 --> 02:29:23.590]
Well, good day, mate.

[02:29:23.970 --> 02:29:24.490]
Okay, mate.

[02:29:25.050 --> 02:29:25.670]
See ya, eh?

[02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:27.730]
Okay, that's going to do it.

[02:29:27.770 --> 02:29:28.270]
Thank you, Stan.

[02:29:28.390 --> 02:29:29.810]
Stan will be on tomorrow night?

[02:29:30.110 --> 02:29:30.690]
Tomorrow night.

[02:29:30.970 --> 02:29:32.490]
And one of these nights soon on the stage.

[02:29:32.490 --> 02:29:33.390]
And most of the next week.

[02:29:33.390 --> 02:29:34.230]
8 to 11 o'clock.

[02:29:34.330 --> 02:29:38.370]
Right, that's the sports talk that's right before the notorious Larry King.

[02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:40.050]
Stay tuned for Rick and Puts.

[02:29:40.150 --> 02:29:41.190]
They've got a hell of a show lined up.

[02:29:41.230 --> 02:29:42.430]
They've got all my cards out of the racks.

[02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:43.390]
They're going to be fantastic.

[02:29:43.390 --> 02:29:48.930]
And we'll see you tomorrow morning at 10 here on 610 radio modeling at WIOD.

[02:29:59.810 --> 02:30:02.150]
Stan, cheers of adolescent man.

[02:30:02.910 --> 02:30:06.350]
Brought to you by Elephant Woods, the only runner for the condom department.

[02:30:08.690 --> 02:30:10.310]
We've been getting along well.

[02:30:10.810 --> 02:30:11.430]
Don't you think?

[02:30:11.430 --> 02:30:12.370]
Absolutely.

[02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:14.830]
We have a great time together.

[02:30:15.390 --> 02:30:16.570]
We're really compatible.

[02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:17.790]
Don't you think?

[02:30:18.610 --> 02:30:19.170]
Absolutely.

[02:30:20.090 --> 02:30:21.730]
We have a great time together.

[02:30:22.330 --> 02:30:24.330]
I love spending time with you.

[02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:26.590]
Do you like spending time with me?

[02:30:27.150 --> 02:30:29.530]
Let me say it a little slower.

[02:30:30.430 --> 02:30:31.150]
Absolutely.

[02:30:32.290 --> 02:30:34.430]
We have a great time together.

[02:30:35.390 --> 02:30:37.430]
That's why I need a...
