[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]
I gotta go my brain muffin just kicked in.

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.880]
I'm gonna run you back to me, man.

[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.480]
I'm gonna run you back to me, man.

[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.920]
I'm gonna run you back to me, man.

[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.500]
I'm gonna run you back to me, man.

[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:57.260]
I'm gonna run you back to me, man.

[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.300]
Okay, 10 out of 7 at WYOD.

[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.620]
If anybody was at the homeowner's meeting at Mayfair last night,

[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.600]
I'd sure like to find out.

[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.320]
I would have liked to have been a fly on the wall there,

[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.420]
but I didn't go.

[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.300]
I could find out what transpired.

[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.060]
Probably nothing.

[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.740]
And I have some more to pass along about that little later on.

[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.120]
Also, not planning, of course, was on last night.

[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.900]
We'll probably get our not-slanding people.

[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.860]
WYOD.

[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.700]
Hello.

[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.260]
Hello.

[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.200]
Hi.

[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.860]
Hello.

[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.400]
Hello.

[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.040]
Who's this?

[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.300]
This is Joanne.

[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.300]
Joanne?

[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.960]
I have been to be the niece of the people that Leo is living

[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.540]
is staying at their house.

[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.240]
Really?

[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.560]
Well, this is Neil, Joanne.

[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.020]
Hi.

[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.100]
How you doing?

[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.940]
Good.

[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.740]
The not-slanding lady told me that I should call you.

[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.300]
Yeah.

[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.400]
That you've been trying to get in touch with my aunt, Nunkal.

[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.380]
Yeah, hopeless.

[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.020]
Hopeless.

[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.400]
I don't think they exist.

[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.640]
Well, I think.

[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.380]
I'm not sure, but I think that they're in Hong Kong right now.

[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.700]
They're in Hong Kong?

[00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.260]
Great.

[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.240]
Well, that's nice.

[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.780]
They're also really never at home.

[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.900]
They're always at their shop.

[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.220]
Don't you have that phone number?

[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.980]
Yeah, I sure do.

[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.740]
Have you tried reaching them there?

[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.220]
Yeah.

[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.660]
They're not there.

[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.480]
Yeah, I was talking to your neighbor who lives behind you.

[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.460]
Oh, yeah.

[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.820]
If it's some pretty nasty things, it's not here.

[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.620]
You know something?

[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.440]
I haven't done anything to the neighbor who lives behind me.

[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.840]
They act like some kind of psychotic recluses or something.

[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.720]
What is their problem?

[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.860]
What's their problem?

[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.880]
Besides a satellite dish, which was none of their business in the first place, what's their problem?

[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.120]
Well, I was talking to her yesterday and said that it's making the neighborhood look crappy and stuff.

[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.980]
It makes the neighborhood look crappy?

[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.300]
Yeah, that you have your satellite because she couldn't keep her boat there.

[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.740]
No, I don't have a...

[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.020]
Nobody sees the satellite.

[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.420]
It's got a patio on it.

[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.500]
There's nobody sees it.

[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.940]
Right.

[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.860]
I know that's a problem.

[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.900]
And you know something?

[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.840]
And you know something?

[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.760]
They have an awning, then umbrella, just same kind.

[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.380]
It's not open, but they have it over there patio, table two.

[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.480]
Same colors.

[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.280]
Right.

[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.480]
Now, what's the difference?

[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.500]
I don't know.

[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.840]
I told her that it makes the neighborhood look crappy.

[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.520]
How come nobody else in the neighborhood thinks it looks crappy?

[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.260]
I don't know.

[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.040]
Yeah.

[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.080]
I just told her that I think all the neighbors should just leave you alone.

[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.100]
So what are all the other...

[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.600]
I'm sure the audience would love to hear.

[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.740]
What are all the other nasty things they had to say that we can repeat on the air?

[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.700]
Well, just that it looks crappy and she's mad because she can't have her boat there.

[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.400]
Why should she have a boat?

[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.320]
What's the comparison between a boat and a patio umbrella?

[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.120]
Is this woman...

[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.260]
No.

[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.420]
Out of her mind?

[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.280]
I don't know.

[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.620]
They can't have their boat, so I can't have my dish.

[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.800]
See, do you see how childish these people all are?

[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.520]
Well, that's what I thought.

[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.900]
Do you see how juvenile it is?

[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.920]
I'd like you to deal with that with my uncle.

[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.140]
Well, you know what?

[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.500]
Let me just tell you something.

[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.960]
Once I take the dish out, which I have another 11 days before I have to remove it.

[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.520]
Okay.

[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.460]
And then I'll take it out.

[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.420]
Once I take it out, the umbrella is going to stay there just out of spite.

[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.580]
And there's no log against having a patio umbrella.

[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.960]
Okay?

[00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.760]
There just won't be anything underneath it.

[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.160]
So they won't have accomplished anything.

[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.640]
Right.

[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.480]
Well, it's just like the neighborhood food trash on your lawn.

[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.920]
That didn't accomplish anything.

[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.020]
Yeah, it accomplished something.

[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.380]
All right.

[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.440]
It got everybody crazy.

[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.540]
That's what it accomplished.

[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.160]
Yeah.

[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.820]
Yeah.

[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.020]
It's wonderful.

[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.540]
It's a wonderful complex.

[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.680]
It's just a wonderful...

[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.500]
Just tell your aunt and uncle when you talk to them next time,

[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.320]
just for them to kiss the ground that they don't have to live there.

[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.640]
I'm sorry.

[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.640]
I'll tell you what, I'll take the dish out and I'll put a boat in my backyard.

[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.140]
How's that?

[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.980]
Will that make her feel better?

[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.300]
No, that'll piss her off.

[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.620]
Good.

[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.480]
Good.

[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.300]
Only won't be a real boat.

[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.620]
It'll just be a replica, like of the Queen Mary.

[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.220]
How's that?

[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.980]
And we can have two queens.

[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.900]
Okay.

[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.560]
But anyway...

[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.300]
If I talk to them, I'm going to tell them that you're trying to get to them.

[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.640]
Yeah.

[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.320]
I'll call you.

[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.500]
Well, what are they going for?

[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.480]
Like a year or something?

[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.380]
I think they were going for a few weeks.

[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.700]
They're really nice.

[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.640]
Yeah.

[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.060]
Boy.

[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.300]
The neighbor was saying that they're supposed to be moving back, too.

[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.620]
But I didn't hear that.

[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.360]
Well, the neighbor sure knows an awful lot, don't they?

[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.880]
They're not moving back for three years.

[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.080]
That's what I heard.

[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.480]
Yeah.

[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.340]
So the neighbor's got some bad information.

[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.380]
The neighbor's awfully nosy is what I think would be the bottom line, right?

[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.220]
Got a nose like serenote a burger rack.

[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.100]
Like Joey Reynolds.

[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.180]
Well, listen, what's your first name?

[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.700]
Joanne.

[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.740]
Joanne, thanks very much for the information.

[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.400]
Okay.

[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.220]
And next time you talk to my lovely neighbors, give them a message for me.

[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.600]
Okay.

[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.420]
Tell them up there.

[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.700]
See ya.

[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.280]
Okay, bye.

[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.640]
Bye.

[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.260]
What a great first call.

[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.920]
Outstanding.

[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.060]
They don't want me to have the dish because they couldn't keep their boat in their yard.

[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.480]
Now, I think it's pretty obvious.

[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:44.640]
You know, you see the similarity between the patio on it, like maybe an alligator or a boat or a rhinoceros or hippopotamus or

[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.500]
you know, a 40 gallon tank with piranhas.

[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.220]
I think there's a lot of similarity, don't you?

[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.260]
Boy, just incredible.

[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.080]
Shocking.

[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.860]
Shocking.

[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.220]
Anyway, boy, that's some pretty good information.

[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.480]
See how you have to find out through the radio show.

[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.860]
You can't find out anything else, you know, just through regular channels because they're in Hong Kong and this one's on the moon.

[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.920]
And that one's on Uranus or whatever.

[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.420]
It's 10.16.

[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.420]
Well, people are starving.

[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.820]
Okay, just everybody relax.

[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.220]
Boy, that first call, we might as well go home now.

[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.560]
That told me everything I needed.

[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.860]
No.

[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:36.440]
By the way, if you're interested in becoming the Miracle Baseball Team PA announcer for all Miracle Baseball Games at Municipal Stadium in Pomano Beach, call 7-8-3-21-11 for more information.

[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.940]
Now, what does anybody know what that is?

[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.440]
The Miracle?

[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:39.060]
Okay.

[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.900]
In other words, if you call, it'll be a great deal.

[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.740]
Okay, let's go to the Notz Landing Lady on 5.

[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.140]
That's the Notz Landing Boy.

[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.280]
Well, the Notz Landing Boy.

[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.960]
Well, I saw Notz Landing and I assumed.

[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.220]
Are we going to wait a minute?

[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.900]
Hold on a second.

[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:51.660]
She's on 4.

[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.020]
Yeah, I'm on 4 now.

[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.240]
And he's on 5.

[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.100]
Why don't you put him on?

[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.540]
We can put him on together.

[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.200]
Hi, Notz Landing Lady.

[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.240]
Hello, how you doing?

[00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.560]
How's that?

[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.100]
Good.

[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.720]
What do you think?

[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.000]
I thought it was pretty decent.

[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.980]
Yeah, it was okay.

[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.560]
It was okay.

[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.040]
Can you believe some people that honestly that they're showing how many women are there?

[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.900]
Yeah, that's really nice.

[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.100]
Can money really buy that many women at the same time?

[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.580]
Anything that moves, he's into.

[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.400]
He really is.

[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.940]
And what about Danny?

[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.620]
And Paige's mother is pretty much anything too.

[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.340]
Yeah, she's always been like that.

[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.500]
Yeah, all over everything like that.

[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:21.840]
Yeah, blanket.

[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.260]
Exactly.

[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.300]
That was the only really good part of the show.

[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:25.760]
Yeah.

[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:31.340]
Is when he was just about starting to curl Anne's hair and a little locks around his finger and Paige walked in.

[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.900]
That was good.

[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.260]
It was good.

[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.680]
I had a few good yucks over there.

[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.960]
And of course, Michael had a lot on the show.

[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.660]
I figured out something about Michael.

[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.960]
He's like on the outside of everybody's existence.

[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.780]
He's like a little lemon looking from the outside in.

[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:43.520]
It really is.

[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.800]
But he doesn't have any life.

[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:45.840]
He's not into anything.

[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.840]
He doesn't do anything.

[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.680]
He just goes to work.

[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.900]
He comes home and can only imagine after that.

[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.200]
But that's it.

[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.660]
Yeah, he looked good last night.

[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.540]
Yeah, well, yeah, for about six seconds.

[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.080]
What about Danny thinking that he owns the house now after that?

[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.000]
Danny is kind of guy.

[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.800]
You know, something I think Danny used to be in radio management.

[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:06.540]
I really do.

[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.820]
How does he get to own the house after just moving?

[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.300]
Well, he just kind of like moved in.

[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.020]
She moved out.

[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.240]
So he's there and she's not.

[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.120]
You know, they say possession is 90% of the law.

[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.600]
That's it.

[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.540]
Like my neighbor's boat.

[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.980]
Did you hear that about my neighbor's boat?

[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.640]
Is it, you know, really stop and think about the comparison.

[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.020]
See, this is sour grapes.

[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.960]
We can have our boats so you can have your dish.

[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.220]
You should have figured that out.

[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:29.780]
After the prank.

[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.880]
It's ruining the looks of the neighborhood.

[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.960]
What are these people thinking about?

[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.020]
And they are so mysterious.

[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.240]
Now every time you go anywhere outside, they all of a sudden close the blinds

[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.280]
and the lights all go off.

[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.380]
It's like, man, it's the most bizarre scene I have ever seen.

[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.980]
It's almost like you should write a book called Mayfair's Land.

[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.140]
I'm beginning to wonder if Danny ain't hanging out with them.

[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.020]
That might be it.

[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.480]
Maybe he's the relative.

[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.820]
And he could be.

[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.860]
And how about these speaking of broadcasts?

[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.420]
And how about Michellee's groupies?

[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.100]
You know anything about any of that stuff?

[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.340]
That one hairy guy is like Gilbert almost.

[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.580]
See, I thought I was losing my mind because I looked when they caught hairy eyes.

[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.520]
So that's not the guy that they kept showing before.

[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.320]
And it wasn't.

[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.660]
And the other guy is kind of lurking outside.

[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.860]
He had one regular and one not so regular.

[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:17.120]
Yeah.

[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.620]
Well, in this business, there are always some weird psychopaths out there

[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.360]
who get all hopped up, you know, just can't control themselves.

[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.360]
Take it a little too seriously.

[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:24.940]
Yeah.

[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.360]
So I think probably what's going to happen.

[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.520]
This is my prediction.

[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:29.740]
What was that?

[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.820]
Was that one of Val's kids again?

[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.120]
Yeah.

[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:32.820]
Val Valin.

[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.260]
Val Valin.

[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:35.820]
Yeah.

[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.260]
Anyway, my prediction is that the last episode of this season,

[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.300]
somebody's going to shoot.

[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.140]
This guy's going to shoot at Michellee and then it's going to be like,

[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.260]
we'll have to wait till September.

[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.140]
Like, close hangar.

[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.100]
Remember what they did with Val last year in the last show?

[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.100]
Well, same thing.

[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.400]
Every last episode has to hang on a shooting.

[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:51.880]
Yeah.

[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:53.460]
That's true.

[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.120]
I think Val and Gary may be a...

[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.840]
An item, yeah.

[00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.240]
Yeah.

[00:09:59.460 --> 00:09:59.900]
No question.

[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.100]
Well, they're a match made in heaven.

[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.100]
And Olivia's been held by...

[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.100]
I noticed that Val had a Ryan wanted Gary's horses too, so...

[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.060]
Yeah, did you see Olivia come in this morning on the bus?

[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:10.660]
Yeah.

[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.240]
How did you like that shot of Miami International Airport?

[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.880]
Isn't it nice that they've changed the facing on the whole airport?

[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.420]
That was the most phony shot.

[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:22.040]
I guess for six seconds they weren't going to come all the way down here to shoot on location.

[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.400]
Wouldn't that be something if they did come down here and shoot part of the show on location?

[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.520]
Show where on your show.

[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.260]
Yeah, and then maybe Michael will come down to get his money from...

[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.200]
What's his name?

[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.080]
Harold, yeah.

[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:32.700]
That's a good idea.

[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.500]
You went to do a show together.

[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:35.780]
I'll sell him a bus ticket.

[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:37.900]
Well, listen, excellent job.

[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.960]
You've analyzed it perfectly.

[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.700]
And you're becoming quite a match yourselves.

[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.380]
All righty.

[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:43.980]
Okay.

[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.100]
We'll talk to you next Friday, Neil.

[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.120]
Bye-bye.

[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.680]
Okay, there they go.

[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.520]
Mr. and Mrs. Frickin' Frack, ooh, I like that.

[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.500]
Can you do it in there?

[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:51.980]
There we go.

[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.720]
Okay, 21 past 10, W-I-O-D.

[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.580]
And it was okay last night.

[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.880]
I wasn't one of the great barn burners in a history of not slandering, but it was okay.

[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.040]
It wasn't Tom Broke on the Nightly News.

[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.980]
I'm sick of that.

[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.720]
I'm sick of that.

[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.360]
No, this is the day of the year.

[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.740]
Would everyone do me a tie or this?

[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.680]
Say, Colleen, would you be wanting to come over to my place to help me wax my shell?

[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.040]
Ooh, now this I would, my compatriot.

[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.900]
If you be wet in the clean.

[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.700]
I know there's a smart lassie.

[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:35.280]
Please make sure her lad is wearing the Kelly Green prediction of leprecha condoms.

[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.020]
Don't be wishing I'd afford to live clover.

[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.980]
I'll fall in for the gift of gab.

[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.500]
Especially if you plan on kissing some blindy stones.

[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.820]
And what have you?

[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.280]
The doublet in your prediction.

[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.040]
With leprecha condoms they're strong enough for a man.

[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.960]
But I like him too.

[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.860]
So take yourself a leprecha condom.

[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.200]
And you won't be catching anything else.

[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.380]
Okay, we have a very distraught collar online.

[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.020]
What is it?

[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:03.340]
What's 6?

[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:03.920]
Are you there?

[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.640]
No, there's that ticking sound.

[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.720]
Nick's probably going to be happy about that.

[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:09.400]
You know who that was.

[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.220]
That was Nick's buddy, his number one fan.

[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.260]
I had something special.

[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:12.980]
I'll plan for him.

[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.520]
But he'll have to call back before I'll play it.

[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.320]
Okay, we have one open line in Broward and one in Palm Beach on a very mellow Friday.

[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.640]
Don't you feel just like laying back today and just taking a little nap?

[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.080]
Just that ambience.

[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.360]
Thicing warm outside.

[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.660]
And the wind is blowing in the breeze there in the trees and between your knees.

[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.500]
And it's just kind of one of those weekends.

[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.500]
Let's try Haya Lea.

[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:35.800]
Hello.

[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:36.820]
I'm Neil.

[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.540]
Good morning.

[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.180]
How are you?

[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.280]
How are you?

[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.900]
Okay, what's the twinging?

[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.020]
Oh, I just woke up.

[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.500]
Oh, man.

[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.040]
What a beautiful dway.

[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:49.920]
Day.

[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.020]
Dway.

[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.360]
But it's so beautiful.

[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:53.380]
Yeah.

[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.940]
The sun is shining here and the gorgeous Haya Lea.

[00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:58.940]
You're not in Haya Lea.

[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.360]
They wouldn't let you in Haya Lea.

[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.440]
I'm in Haya Lea.

[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:01.820]
I'm party.

[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:02.320]
What do you do?

[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.240]
Shop at Miami Springs at the video store.

[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.840]
Oh, man.

[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.300]
Who's that?

[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.360]
Who's that in the back?

[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.760]
Are you all sleeping together?

[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:09.320]
Yeah.

[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.060]
We all wake up together this morning with a start, I bet.

[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.040]
We are.

[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:13.420]
This is what.

[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.840]
This is what gives new meaning to the phrase jumpstart.

[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.920]
Oh, I knew.

[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.200]
They are.

[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.440]
They're all there together.

[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.160]
They think they're funny.

[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.300]
They what?

[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.700]
They think they're funny.

[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:25.800]
Okay.

[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.340]
But do you have funny?

[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.440]
I told you that's a funny radio.

[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.540]
No, they're getting out of hand now.

[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.320]
They're getting out of hand?

[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.180]
Well, that's about time.

[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.460]
Wait, wait, wait.

[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.560]
Where you guys stop it?

[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.620]
You guys are showing me twer.

[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:41.940]
Neil.

[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.160]
Will you get them out of the sack?

[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:43.600]
No.

[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:44.780]
Do you know what time it is already?

[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.140]
It's out of my sweeping bag.

[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.940]
It's 10.30 already.

[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.800]
Get them out of the sack.

[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.200]
Okay.

[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.100]
None of them work on corn wheels.

[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.260]
And have a great weekend.

[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.480]
Okay, that was Elmer Fudge, Jr.

[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.940]
28 past 10 at WIOD.

[00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.020]
Okay, there's an opening and date.

[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.760]
And we'll answer Broward right here.

[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.100]
Won't we?

[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:01.940]
WIOD.

[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.620]
I'm sorry.

[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.900]
What happened to you?

[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.000]
I just couldn't take it though.

[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.860]
Everybody was happy and I...

[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:09.580]
Listen, listen.

[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.620]
This is going to make you feel better.

[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.040]
Okay, listen.

[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.720]
Just don't say anything yet.

[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.260]
All right.

[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:13.800]
All right.

[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.700]
Don't be a nigg head.

[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.340]
Lock it in.

[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.480]
Have you feel better?

[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:35.400]
Thank you.

[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.280]
I have some bad news though.

[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:38.060]
What?

[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.340]
I'm going to read a memo.

[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.740]
You ready?

[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:43.720]
Go ahead.

[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.540]
You might start hyperventilating when you hear this.

[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:46.220]
Go ahead.

[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.200]
To AM programming at NewsStab from Boy Geary.

[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.940]
Thanks to Nick Lawrence's quick action and eyewitness

[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.120]
to the Miramar plane crash was routed

[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.220]
to the 610 WIOD newsroom, allowing us to get the story

[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.240]
on the year first.

[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.240]
For his quick action, Nick will be enjoying a dinner for two

[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.600]
at Bert and Jack's Nice Going Nick.

[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:09.740]
Come.

[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.480]
Carbon copy.

[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:12.580]
Nick Lawrence.

[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.660]
I hate him.

[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.020]
Good.

[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.940]
I knew I'd get him in the right frame of mind.

[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.300]
One hat, by the way, yesterday on Alex's show in the midst of

[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:29.200]
a 600-other hate calls, he had the guy who did this card.

[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.360]
This guy, boy, his voice is so recognizable.

[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.140]
I haven't heard him other than on this card until yesterday.

[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.200]
If you missed the Neil Rogers show yesterday on 610 WIOD,

[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.880]
you missed this.

[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.420]
Is this the bird?

[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:43.960]
Yeah.

[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:44.980]
Bird, how you doing?

[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:45.380]
Okay.

[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:50.380]
Listen, do me a favor, play anything because I can't stand listening to you.

[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.940]
You start like a douchebag.

[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.460]
Do you just need me a favor, play anything?

[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.400]
Well, can I ask you a question before you go?

[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.420]
Oh, God, you sound so stupid.

[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.560]
I hate to talk to you.

[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.180]
Yeah, go ahead.

[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.340]
Why did you call me?

[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.180]
I didn't call you.

[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.980]
You're not just to tell you not to say anything.

[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.280]
Just play something.

[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.840]
Oh, God can't stand it.

[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.300]
Well, then why are you listening?

[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.000]
I'll play something already.

[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.400]
Why won't you answer me?

[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.740]
Oh, God, stand it.

[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.680]
You won't see he won't talk to me.

[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.920]
Oh, we got a car here.

[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.280]
Hello.

[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.380]
He had turned it down to about 60.

[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.000]
I'm ready to really freeze in here.

[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.460]
I'm serious.

[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.660]
Turn it down, make it as cold as you want, man.

[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.220]
That's a way to do it.

[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.540]
I want to be like Disney.

[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.520]
I want to be on ice.

[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:29.700]
Mike Disney.

[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:31.520]
Mentally that is.

[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.260]
Anyway, it's 10.30 a.w.i.o.d.

[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.240]
It's a wonderful Friday.

[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.880]
The Nuts Landing people have called.

[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.520]
And my land lady's niece is that what it was called.

[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.600]
And it's been pretty productive.

[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.500]
W-I-O-D.

[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.540]
Okay, probably next friend again, getting a little distraught.

[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.220]
W-I-O-D.

[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:49.900]
That's what I said.

[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:50.160]
Yeah.

[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:50.860]
Hello.

[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.080]
Are you on a phone?

[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.160]
Are you like between a rock and a hard place?

[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.540]
Who is this?

[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:57.480]
This is Neil.

[00:16:59.060 --> 00:16:59.560]
Who's this?

[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.720]
You are on the radio, sir.

[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.880]
There's a seven-second delay.

[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.160]
Now, did you call to speak to me or hear yourself on the radio?

[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.360]
I called to speak to you.

[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:07.560]
Okay, now are you in the car?

[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:08.960]
Where are you?

[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.680]
You're on the radio.

[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.880]
You're on the radio.

[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:13.220]
Sir?

[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:16.080]
How can you always talk bad about Florida?

[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.060]
About Florida?

[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:17.580]
Yeah.

[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.620]
Have you ever seen a map?

[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.020]
Yeah, I've seen a map.

[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.200]
Do you see the shape of the state of Florida?

[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.440]
Sir, are you listening to me?

[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.120]
Yes, I'm listening.

[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.300]
Have you seen the shape of the state of Florida?

[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.180]
Yeah, what about it?

[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:29.900]
What does it look like?

[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.680]
It looks like a panhandle.

[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.380]
It looks like a panhandle?

[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:34.740]
Yeah.

[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.860]
How can we not go back up north this Florida?

[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.380]
Sir, let me ask you a question.

[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.880]
Do you know what a panhandle is?

[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:41.680]
Yeah.

[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.640]
Do you know Oklahoma?

[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.220]
Do you know anything?

[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:46.440]
Yeah.

[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:47.520]
I know where I work.

[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.840]
I don't care where you work unless you want to give me a free plug.

[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:51.700]
Excuse me?

[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.720]
You want to give me a free plug?

[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.280]
What do you sound so surly about?

[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.260]
What is your problem?

[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.280]
Why are you so surly?

[00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.600]
You people listen to this show every day over there, don't you?

[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:00.400]
Yeah.

[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.740]
Then what's the problem?

[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.340]
Unfortunately, we listen to it.

[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.000]
Oh, in other words, somebody is forcing you to listen.

[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:06.480]
Yeah.

[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.420]
Who is it?

[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:07.920]
Is it somebody?

[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.260]
This guy named Rick Paglino.

[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.660]
Rick, is Rick over there?

[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.060]
Yeah.

[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.060]
Put Rick on the phone.

[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:12.660]
Hold on.

[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.200]
Slime ball.

[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.560]
Come here.

[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.520]
Come on, Rick.

[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.940]
Rick, come on, Rick.

[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.520]
I want to talk to Rick.

[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.780]
I don't want to talk to this guy.

[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:21.380]
Guys.

[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.020]
Hello, Neil.

[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:22.840]
Is this Rick?

[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:23.420]
Yes.

[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.260]
Who is that guy?

[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.180]
He's one of the workers here that I want to talk to.

[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.020]
I'm out content.

[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.320]
What is his problem?

[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.040]
He, uh, I don't know what his problem is.

[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.420]
I've been listening to you for a long time.

[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.120]
And I come to work over here.

[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.400]
I want to listen to you on the radio.

[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.140]
And they always want to turn it off to another stage.

[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.140]
Yeah, because you're a bunch of do-do bags, Rick.

[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.180]
Well, that's exactly what they are.

[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.740]
And now listen to you right now.

[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.020]
And he said, well, I'm going to call him up.

[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.220]
And I said, you can't even get through.

[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.640]
And he called up and you got right through.

[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.240]
Sure, on a Palm Beach line, no sweat.

[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:49.880]
Yeah.

[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.600]
So I like to listen to you.

[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.480]
And my mother listens to you all right.

[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:52.680]
Yeah.

[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.200]
Well, you know, I asked him what the state of Florida looks like.

[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.260]
He said a panhandle.

[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.140]
I mean, this guy's got the brains of a monkey.

[00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.980]
Well, he's got a fart in his brain.

[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.980]
He's got a brains of a two-inch monkey.

[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.380]
He's got the brains of a three-year-old pig me.

[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:05.900]
Exactly.

[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.460]
I couldn't have said it better, Rick.

[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.300]
Well, listen, don't take any crap from these y'all.

[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.700]
Who's just telling them to bug off?

[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.440]
Tell them the reason they don't like the show is they're too stupid to understand it.

[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.280]
That's their problem.

[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.620]
I know everything that's going on.

[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.060]
Exactly.

[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.900]
You know, when you say something, they don't know what you're talking about.

[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.960]
I know what you're talking about.

[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.140]
Right.

[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.740]
Well, that's why they feel left out.

[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.140]
It's just like my neighbor with their boat.

[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.420]
They can't have their boat, so I can't have my dish, right?

[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:26.940]
Right.

[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:27.660]
Same crap.

[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.320]
All right.

[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.220]
Well, you have a good weekend and don't take any crap from morons, Rick.

[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.020]
Okay, no more crap.

[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:32.660]
Okay.

[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:33.100]
Thanks.

[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:33.560]
See ya.

[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:39.100]
There's a kind of guy we respect in Palm Beach, who stands up for his rights and tell you,

[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.100]
what's the state of Florida look like?

[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.460]
And he says, a panhandle suit.

[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:48.320]
Don't you understand the panhandle is the handle and the upper part of the state and the upper part of the peninsula?

[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.100]
Or is that word too big for you, sir?

[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.880]
All I see, he wouldn't understand what the state looks like because he probably don't have one.

[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.500]
Anyway, it's 1034 at WIOD.

[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.840]
Let's go to Miami.

[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:01.260]
Hello.

[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.460]
Hey, you know, the best part of not planning is pages ass.

[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.020]
Well, there's something for everybody on that show, sir.

[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:10.840]
Yeah, I'm telling you.

[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.620]
You've obviously been watching very closely.

[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.020]
Yeah, and how's your panhandle doing?

[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.420]
Is it hanging there?

[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:16.720]
Yeah.

[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.860]
Well, obviously, there's somebody in Palm Beach who was born without one.

[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.500]
Well, let me tell you something new.

[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.420]
You're so suck.

[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.000]
I know.

[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.140]
But you know what?

[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:25.580]
What?

[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:26.240]
You love it.

[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:26.920]
You're right.

[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:27.360]
Okay.

[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.600]
1035 at WIOD.

[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.240]
You see that stuff for Alex.

[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.980]
Don't waste your time with me because I've been here too long and I know better.

[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.920]
The Palm Beach line's ringing again.

[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.940]
ATT operator, we've picked up from BJ.

[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.820]
BJ in the Bahamas.

[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.040]
Where's BJ?

[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.200]
Where's it call coming from, Oppa?

[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.440]
It's from Delaware, sir.

[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.000]
From where?

[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:46.560]
Delaware.

[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.440]
From Delaware.

[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.380]
Yes, we certainly will operator and have a wonderful weekend.

[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.100]
Thank you.

[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:51.480]
You too.

[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:51.940]
Okay.

[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:52.860]
Hello.

[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:53.500]
Hello.

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.380]
Who is this?

[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.400]
It's BJ.

[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.300]
Great.

[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.620]
How come you sound so quiet?

[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.860]
Well, you hung up on me the first time.

[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:01.580]
Why is that?

[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:02.560]
I don't know.

[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.440]
I probably because I'm calling the Palm Beach line.

[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.980]
I hung up on you when this morning?

[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:12.280]
No, just like when you entered a second ago, you said the Palm Beach line is ringing again.

[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:12.780]
Yeah.

[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.300]
No, no, we had a call from there a minute ago.

[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.180]
I know, it was me.

[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.580]
You answered it and said you called back.

[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:19.140]
No, no.

[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.860]
We just, we just, when you listen to me, dunderhead, we just had a call from there.

[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.180]
Just talk to somebody there.

[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:24.780]
Oh.

[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:25.300]
Rick.

[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.340]
Well, I just called on there too.

[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.700]
It is buzzing buddies up there.

[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.220]
Well, listen, so you're on now.

[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:30.920]
Don't quench.

[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.940]
Don't belly ache.

[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.320]
You've been down here too long.

[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.860]
Just think you're in Delaware.

[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.120]
Think what heaven you're in.

[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.280]
Now you're going to hold on a second, right?

[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.060]
All right.

[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.020]
Because we're paying for it.

[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.060]
We've got to do a little business, but we're paying for it.

[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:41.860]
Sure.

[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.120]
Unless you've got something else exciting going on up there.

[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:44.620]
No.

[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.180]
Like maybe you ran into a peninsula.

[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.180]
And we'll win if there's a car coming down.

[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.240]
Okay, hold on.

[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:49.520]
One car.

[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.840]
Okay, check out, see what kind it is and we'll be back to you.

[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.160]
All right.

[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.960]
Okay, we'll come back to Delaware in a second.

[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.900]
It's 1036 at WIOD.

[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.140]
Come with me to my weekend place.

[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.880]
We're going to be doing new things.

[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.940]
This is the weekend to do things.

[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.700]
We'll hear the big games and all the big names.

[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.340]
It's your game.

[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.180]
It's my place.

[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.240]
It's some place special.

[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:27.640]
WIOD.

[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.200]
Now, doesn't that bring back great memories of home, sir?

[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.120]
Yes.

[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.640]
Boys all choked up about it.

[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.800]
Either that or falling asleep.

[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.200]
What are they?

[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.200]
Would you wake up, sir?

[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.220]
Oh, well, I know you're in Delaware, but that's no excuse.

[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:39.960]
Let me ask you.

[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:40.840]
Delaware, like a...

[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.020]
I don't know where I'm going to car, too.

[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.240]
Is Delaware like a...

[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.080]
An insula or a panhandle?

[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.220]
Say what now?

[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.760]
Just ignore it.

[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.380]
So what's going on?

[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.260]
Not much.

[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.280]
Boy, you are so exciting today.

[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.360]
Now, usually you give us at least a little something.

[00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.260]
Well, you're giving us something today.

[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.500]
It's called constipation.

[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.420]
I'm looking forward to a little bit of that.

[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.560]
I'm just kind of getting over some salmonella poisoning.

[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:06.360]
Oh.

[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.660]
You know how you look forward to the...

[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.720]
I thought Sal played for the Oakland A's, third base.

[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:10.320]
Huh?

[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.500]
I thought he played third base for the Oakland A's.

[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.680]
Yeah, but they're locked out right now, so.

[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:15.600]
It's...

[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:16.860]
It's...

[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:16.860]

[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:17.860]
What?

[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:19.680]
Boy, they're...

[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.200]
We're getting sabotaged by Hispanic provocateurs.

[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.800]
Oh, did the TV Martina or whatever go on today?

[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:27.980]
TV Martina, yeah.

[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.280]
Oh, so that's probably what it is.

[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.200]
Castro has probably increased the power over there.

[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.240]
Trying to knock WI of D off here.

[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.880]
So anyway, boy, this...

[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.320]
I'm telling you, people are just falling under the floor from this call.

[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.500]
I figured out about the guy in Palm Beach, by the way,

[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.700]
the call earlier, he took shop in high school.

[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.040]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.920]
See you don't understand any of it, because wouldn't you be better off on hold for a few minutes?

[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:53.620]
Um...

[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.260]
I mean, it's up to you.

[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:54.720]
It's your call.

[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.280]
What is the reason you called, besides the point of view of a coma?

[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.920]
I'm disappointed to hear the red call on the Palm Beach line,

[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:08.100]
because I really was calling to say that I think you ought to change this line from the Palm Beach line.

[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:08.920]
To the Delaware line.

[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.280]
To the Delaware line, because it's the only line I ever call in on.

[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:11.980]
Yeah, okay.

[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:12.720]
Have a nice weekend.

[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.880]
Okay, you too.

[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:14.220]
Bye.

[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:14.600]
Bye.

[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:15.760]
Oh, God.

[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.100]
Let's rip him and ask now, okay, you can't hear us.

[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.260]
That was pathetic, wasn't it?

[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.640]
That could have been one of the worst calls of all time.

[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.460]
One of the worst in history.

[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.740]
1041 at WI of D, but we got a humor, right?

[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.900]
So if there's anybody who took shop in Palm Beach called 655,

[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.220]
isn't...

[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.360]
Now Jews don't take shop in high school, okay?

[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:36.960]
Trust me.

[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.900]
But there are some people out there who take shop, which means basically...

[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:41.700]
I don't want to get into it.

[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.260]
You know what it means.

[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.360]
Carol City.

[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.440]
We can't call watching quite a lot of tales.

[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.060]
Talking about how bombs are stealing 95 per miles.

[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:56.240]
When Suggles Lee was a bulletin to dish up onto the screen.

[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.260]
He was partner and bishop.

[00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.860]
He said just in.

[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.720]
The eyewitness known.

[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.820]
He's covering the Martinez and the two lies.

[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:09.220]
We'll have more dissails coming up at 5.30.

[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.140]
He pulled them from the stores.

[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.800]
So they sold 13.

[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.840]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.760]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.400]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.040]
They cursed Parvatar.

[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.040]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.920]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.780]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.540]
They cursed Parvatar.

[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.220]
I'll have heard the album.

[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.800]
And he was a Paul.

[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.780]
He said, thank you, Janet Reno.

[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.420]
I'm glad that you're called.

[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.280]
We got to take a stand.

[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.520]
I guess it's 13.

[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.100]
Ron, the side is really close to election.

[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.700]
His brother, Judge, friends that I will not fail y'all.

[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.480]
He'll send for any mention.

[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.300]
Oh, Janet, failed y'all.

[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.880]
They're selling six tickets going through to Turkey.

[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.020]
The two lies.

[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.560]
Yeah, they sold 13.

[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.620]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.500]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.160]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.800]
They cursed Parvatar.

[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.800]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.540]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.520]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.440]
They cursed Parvatar.

[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:12.740]
He kept rap a butt.

[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.740]
So he had guts.

[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.180]
So most of the people said, this guy is a butt.

[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.060]
He ripped on land a fat noise pollution.

[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.720]
Even though it went against the Constitution.

[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.440]
And what did he lose to?

[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.200]
Throw him all of his jobs?

[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.280]
So can thousands more copies?

[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.000]
At 12.95, people are brand new more fadies.

[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.400]
He's really perky-driven into the bank.

[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.340]
Because he sold 13.

[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.460]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.320]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.980]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.660]
They cursed Parvatar.

[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.600]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.460]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.340]
Oh, they sold 13.

[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.560]
They cursed Parvatar.

[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:56.640]
Outstanding.

[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.420]
Thank you.

[00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:58.860]
What is that?

[00:26:59.380 --> 00:26:59.480]
Huh?

[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:00.520]
Who did that?

[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.420]
Me and my brother's here.

[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:04.260]
No.

[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:05.540]
Come on.

[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.160]
Where'd you get that?

[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.220]
Is it a record?

[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.240]
I borrowed it from Tanner.

[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:11.580]
Tanner, did that?

[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:12.020]
Yeah.

[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.320]
Yeah, see, I knew it wasn't from GTR because it's too good to be there stuff.

[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.180]
No GTRs, you know.

[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.260]
Mark Mosley did it, right?

[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.760]
GTR gives us out of the garbage.

[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.860]
Well, how come we don't have a copy of it here so we don't have to have you play it over the phone?

[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.820]
Well, because those scumbag can show there don't send you one.

[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.280]
They will.

[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:26.800]
They will.

[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:26.940]
They will.

[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.180]
In fact, Cox, that's, he owes us that for all these chronic calls that he makes on our show.

[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.520]
John Cox's name applies to what he is, huh?

[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.560]
Well, what can I say?

[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.240]
If the shoe fits were it.

[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:37.700]
Exactly.

[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:38.860]
Have a great day.

[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:39.560]
Thanks.

[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:40.520]
Excellent job.

[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:41.100]
That was great.

[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:41.660]
10.45.

[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.800]
But we'd like to have our own copy, Tanner.

[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:44.500]
Okay?

[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.980]
So we can play it loud and clear.

[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.860]
We'll give all the credit in the world to Mark Mosley and all the great people at Power 96.

[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.080]
I guess.

[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.860]
Anyway, there's an opening in day at 751.

[00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:55.080]
W-I-O-D.

[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.540]
Yeah, I'd like to.

[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:57.440]
Can you?

[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.700]
You'd like to speak to Neil?

[00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.680]
Neil Rogers.

[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.460]
Neil Rogers or Mr. Rogers?

[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.180]
Already Rogers.

[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.180]
Do you have your sneakers on, sir?

[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:06.980]
Hang on.

[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.120]
Let me lower my radio.

[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:08.960]
And your sweater?

[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.160]
Why is it up on the ceiling?

[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.760]
He's lowering his radio.

[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.280]
Oh, there it's on the floor now.

[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.780]
Hold on, I can't seem to catch it now.

[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:16.140]
Really?

[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.060]
How about the radio?

[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.640]
Hey, did you hear Alex show yesterday?

[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.260]
Yes, sir.

[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.500]
What a moron with that.

[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.900]
I'm going to block your call.

[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:22.500]
Yeah.

[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.260]
He's a chip off the old block.

[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:24.560]
I heard a saying.

[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.020]
He's a chip off the old block.

[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.400]
All you have to do is call the operator.

[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.820]
Listen, operator, let me say this to you, sir.

[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:33.120]
Let me say this, okay?

[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.840]
The audience has been brutal to this man.

[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.300]
Now you know that.

[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:38.980]
They're brutal, too?

[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:39.440]
Yeah.

[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.780]
Like, they had two brutus?

[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.340]
Yeah, eight two brutte.

[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.720]
Why is that?

[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:46.720]
Why?

[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.660]
Because he's terrible.

[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.380]
Did you call him 40 times yesterday?

[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.260]
No, I just had the pleasure of hearing people calling him

[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.080]
and telling him he sucks.

[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:53.740]
Oh, okay.

[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.500]
Do you like him?

[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:56.680]
Personally?

[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:57.600]
Yeah.

[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.360]
Personally, is that what you said?

[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.140]
Yeah, he's a good guy.

[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.720]
Yeah, I think he's a good guy.

[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.760]
He's just unfortunate.

[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.020]
Let me ask you something.

[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.660]
Let's change the subject, okay?

[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.080]
Peninsula or Panhandle?

[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.780]
Fry or Handle.

[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:11.460]
Okay.

[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:12.500]
Have a great weekend.

[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.120]
All right.

[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:17.740]
1046 at WIOD, we have an opening in Dade County, 751.

[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.300]
WIOD.

[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.000]
Yes, let me speak to Neil, please.

[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:21.940]
You want to speak to Neil?

[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:22.480]
Oh, Neil.

[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:23.220]
Who's this?

[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.000]
It is Rick.

[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.220]
I knew it.

[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.660]
I knew it.

[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.000]
Can I ask you a question?

[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:28.220]
Yeah.

[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.560]
Because we all love you madly, okay?

[00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:31.640]
Some of us more than others.

[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.320]
But why do you sound so happy?

[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.320]
If I were you, I'd be a little psychotic unless you got some good news.

[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.020]
Oh, yeah.

[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.060]
You got good news?

[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.120]
Pretty good news.

[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.360]
What? It's not your baby?

[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.800]
Yeah, man.

[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.380]
No, it's not my baby.

[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.300]
How do you know?

[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.500]
No, she's not pregnant.

[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.480]
I told you.

[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.080]
You kids get so hysterical, but it should teach you a good lesson.

[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.800]
In fact, Rogers got some bags in the other room right now that would come in handy the next day.

[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.960]
They're a little big, but they're...

[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.560]
I'm sure you could handle it.

[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.320]
Thank God.

[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:01.920]
Next time.

[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.000]
I'm telling you, don't be messing around.

[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.620]
Get out those lepros condoms, man.

[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.380]
I guess so.

[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.240]
And try somebody legal age might be a good idea next time, you know?

[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:10.820]
Yeah, right.

[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.020]
Get through that breakfast this morning with.

[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.000]
How many guesses do I gillbert?

[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:16.600]
Yeah.

[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.040]
Oh, Rick, come on.

[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.380]
You're getting like Tim now.

[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.680]
You notice Tim's too embarrassed to call anymore?

[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.540]
No, we just have breakfast.

[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.460]
He paid for it and everything had a good time.

[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:27.960]
And is Tony listening right now?

[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:28.840]
I think so.

[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.260]
I mean, I like your brother.

[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.400]
Tony is a nice guy, but he invited himself to come in here.

[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.140]
And Tony weighs 490 pounds.

[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.900]
I don't want a big fat guy's in here.

[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:39.880]
We want you to come in.

[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:40.720]
Not Tony.

[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.620]
Don't take it personally.

[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:45.360]
It's a nice guy, but, you know, I can look at big fat ugly guys.

[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:46.620]
Are we going to have fat rich come in?

[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.000]
Or I can get a big mirror on the wall.

[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:52.780]
See, Tony, did you give Tony a little lecture on what this show is all about?

[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:53.340]
Yeah.

[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:54.500]
Has he understand now?

[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.140]
Uh-huh.

[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.800]
Okay, well, he won't be coming in there.

[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.300]
It'll be nervous.

[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.460]
I'm right.

[00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.700]
But nothing to worry about, Tony.

[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.200]
Trust me.

[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:01.020]
Yeah, right.

[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.140]
Tell him, and he just got to put him in your core bit.

[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:04.620]
Yeah, that'll be something.

[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.020]
And you're talking to him.

[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:06.820]
He has an anchor.

[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.340]
He could be the anchor on the Queen Mary.

[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.960]
No, don't take it personally, Tony.

[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:10.420]
Come on.

[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.580]
But he used to be a big fat guy, huh?

[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:13.560]
Yep.

[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.760]
Why are you always so happy?

[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.800]
And I'll be side the fact that you work in a video store

[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.960]
and you just sit there watching all those triple X rated movies all day.

[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.240]
I don't know, because gosh, it's great.

[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.380]
This is a great life.

[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:25.900]
Right, right.

[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.220]
Yeah, I guess so.

[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.640]
I'm a very great life.

[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.740]
Get paid for watching Mimi Does Mimie Springs, I guess that's pretty good deal.

[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.200]
But anyway, what was it going to say before?

[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.780]
Oh, you used to weigh 210 pounds.

[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.020]
Yeah.

[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.220]
Anyway, how much is that about 140?

[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.140]
50?

[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:42.760]
Yeah, 150.

[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.200]
160?

[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:44.660]
Yeah.

[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.440]
And you're how tall?

[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:46.020]

[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.040]
63?

[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.620]
And that's a, so you're like Svelte.

[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:50.380]
Yep.

[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:52.760]
This guy used to weigh 210 pounds.

[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.660]
He used to be a big fat slob like his brother, Tony.

[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:54.940]
Yeah.

[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.300]
Don't take it personally, Tony.

[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.500]
But us fat people, we got to embarrass each other and lose in that weight.

[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.680]
So we can all be thin and beautiful like Rick.

[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:02.740]
Yeah, right.

[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.280]
Now Rose called in yesterday and she said she's ready.

[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.300]
She said she did?

[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.580]
She said she's ready.

[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:08.840]
She said does she admits it?

[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.920]
She's into young guys and she'd like to take you out for a little ice cream.

[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.160]
I'm telling I'm willing and I'm willing.

[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.360]
Ready willing and able.

[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:16.680]
Okay.

[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:17.780]
She said don't worry about it.

[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.840]
She's beyond that point.

[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.280]
Yep.

[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.200]
So what are you doing today?

[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:23.280]
What am I doing?

[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:23.640]
Yeah.

[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.680]
Well, I'm going to do a little show here and then I'm going to go with Tom Dennenberg.

[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.540]
You have a little lunch.

[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:28.220]
Uh-huh.

[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.620]
And then I'm going to go home and I'm going to, what I'm going to do, I'm going to go to Lionel Play World.

[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:37.060]
I'm going to buy a little toy boat and throw it over my fence into my neighbor's yard so they can have a boat in their yard that they always wanted.

[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:37.860]
I'm serious.

[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.060]
I'm going to attach a note to it.

[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.420]
And I'm going to say here's your boat.

[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.780]
Hope you're happy now.

[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.660]
To get poor gasoline all around it.

[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:45.440]
Did you hear that?

[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:49.620]
Did you hear that thing though about, they don't want me to have my satellite dish because they can't have their boats.

[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:50.640]
Like little children.

[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.820]
Oh my gosh.

[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.320]
Well, give them the boat then.

[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.200]
I'm giving them a boat.

[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:54.600]
Free.

[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:54.920]
Free.

[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.420]
I'm giving it to boat of them.

[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:01.700]
Well, Rick, I want to tell you now you coming in one day next week you're going to keep playing hard to get.

[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:02.680]
So to speak.

[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.400]
I'll come one day.

[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:05.440]
Have you ever looked at a map?

[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:06.380]
A map.

[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.460]
Of the state of Florida?

[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.520]
Now what would you say the state of Florida looks like on a map?

[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.460]
Can say.

[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:11.940]
Okay.

[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:13.900]
But you have a pretty good idea.

[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:14.320]
Yeah.

[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.320]
It rings a bell.

[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:17.540]
Yeah, it rings a bell.

[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.460]
Okay, so what is it Monday you're coming in?

[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:20.320]
Monday?

[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:20.840]
Yeah.

[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.560]
All right, I'll go in there for a couple hours.

[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:23.080]
Okay.

[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:27.620]
That's what you said Thursday too and you shine this that second day because your boss is a pinhead.

[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:28.240]
Okay.

[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.620]
Now we'd like to have you around here, Rick.

[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.240]
Just, you know, just to look at and kind of find a little bit.

[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.440]
Yeah, I'll go and I'll surprise you.

[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:35.100]
Okay.

[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.560]
You know, promises, promises.

[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:38.580]
Have a great weekend, Rick.

[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.820]
Yeah, one more thing.

[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:40.160]

[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.460]
You know what Gilbert was?

[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.240]
He was a guest host at the Long Randy Martin.

[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:45.920]
Oh, no.

[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.900]
Oh, Bill's going to have a relapse.

[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:50.840]
A relapse.

[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:51.860]
Oh, man.

[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:52.560]
Have a good one.

[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:53.300]
Yeah.

[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.180]
Give me a call, Rick.

[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:54.860]
Okay, no problem.

[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:55.940]
Breathe heavy on the phone.

[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.440]
Not now, little see ya.

[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.100]
10.51 at WIOD.

[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.100]
He's just...

[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.660]
10.55 at WIOD.

[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:08.660]

[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:09.220]
Look at that boy.

[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.080]
We're getting way behind her.

[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.700]
So, did anybody see the Larry King interview with Louis Ferrican last night?

[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.920]
That was the most embarrassing but looking interview I've ever seen in my life.

[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:19.480]
I got friend Louis Ferrican.

[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:24.120]
And no matter how much Ferrican lied, he just sat there like a statue.

[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.000]
Oh yeah, okay.

[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:25.500]
Okay.

[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.820]
The only interesting thing he said was...

[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:28.520]
Go on me 50 dollars.

[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.060]
Okay, here's a mobile in North Miami.

[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:30.500]
Hello.

[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.260]
Go on.

[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.760]
Oh boy, I love that sound.

[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.600]
Coral Springs.

[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:35.560]
Hey Neil.

[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.660]
On the Bokeh line.

[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.480]
I can't wait to get the bill for this one.

[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.340]
It's going to be a good one.

[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.880]
My not-slanding material is old.

[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:44.560]
It's used.

[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.040]
We might as well forget it.

[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:46.440]
Yeah.

[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.880]
But, uh...

[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.100]
No, I'm not in my opinion of, you know, the shape of the state of Florida.

[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.880]
If you really think about it, it's like the shape of a severely swollen hemorrhoid.

[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:55.740]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.500]
Yeah, it's pretty much the same with the people here too.

[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.720]
And it is, and the state does tend to be a pain in the ass.

[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.700]
Uh, definitely, but, uh...

[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:03.500]
No, I think, uh...

[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.680]
Let's see, as far as, uh...

[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.520]
Let me just throw a not-slanding thing to you.

[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.560]
I'm hoping that the disease that, uh...

[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.500]
Who is it, uh...

[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:12.500]
Ah!

[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.000]
Greg Sumner.

[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:14.520]
Thank you.

[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:15.420]
Thank you.

[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.340]
That he has patches on of a shell Phillips and a boob drop off.

[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:19.720]
Yeah.

[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.020]
Well, I think she's only got a sonon anyway.

[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.400]
Well, I tell you, but I didn't realize that was Michelle Phillips.

[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:25.900]
Yeah.

[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:26.760]
I had no idea.

[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.400]
Sure is.

[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.380]
Well, we like Michelle.

[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.140]
We got Michelle Lee.

[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:29.920]
Yeah.

[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.420]
Michelle Phillips, and, uh...

[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.080]
Maybe we'll have Michelle Gillin on it, and...

[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.040]
Okay, it could be.

[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:34.680]
Yeah, we're happy.

[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.120]
And in the tradition of, uh...

[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.800]
She could pay some on, because she don't have any.

[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.860]
Yeah, and in like Michelle Lee, like, can we write you letters?

[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.800]
And can we get pictures of you and your letters?

[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.160]
Don't need 50 dollars.

[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.400]
Hmm, interesting.

[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:47.380]
Thank you, Neil.

[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.180]
Have a great day.

[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.240]
1057 of Good Old WIOD.

[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.500]
It's a fabulous Friday.

[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:53.920]
God, what a great day to be alive.

[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.100]
If you could all be as happy as Rick in the video store,

[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.260]
life would be worth living, right?

[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.820]
I think there's something going on.

[00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.580]
We don't know about.

[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.500]
Dear Field.

[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:00.840]
Yeah.

[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.520]
Uh, Neil, the big...

[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.480]
On the Broward line.

[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.340]
Isn't that interesting?

[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.060]
The big race tomorrow in Hurnie and Dale.

[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.800]
What's your opinion on, uh, Florida Derby tomorrow?

[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.700]
I don't have any opinion, because I haven't paid any attention to it,

[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.500]
and, uh, that's the name of that tune.

[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.060]
I will get the thing out though here, if it'll make you happy.

[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.600]
I mean, you got nine horses, so it's not like 12.

[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:20.520]
Yeah.

[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.200]
While I like the smaller fields,

[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.200]
would like two or three horses, then you got a chance.

[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:24.940]
Yeah.

[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.400]
Let's take a look here, what we got in the Florida Derby tomorrow, shall we?

[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:29.680]
Where the hell is it?

[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.460]
And I know you don't like Pat Day, and he's riding the favorite.

[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.680]
I hate Pat Day.

[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:34.860]
It makes me nauseous.

[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.180]
It makes me sick to my stomach.

[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.700]
Um, where the hell is it?

[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:41.140]
Where's the field for the Florida Derby?

[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.000]
On the front page.

[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.020]
Of the Sun Sentinel?

[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:43.800]
No, the Harold.

[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:44.520]
Oh, the Harold.

[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.060]
No wonder.

[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.000]
Oh, the sports.

[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:48.880]
Yeah, I would think so.

[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.320]
Uh, here's the business section.

[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.100]
No.

[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.640]
Here's the local section.

[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.560]
Here's the sports section.

[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.520]
Boy, this is quite a project.

[00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:57.980]
Okay.

[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.200]
Um, Liptin, tennis.

[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.380]
Nobody cares about that.

[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.400]
Schulis says marinos going bye-bye, maybe.

[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.340]
Uh, here it is.

[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.200]
Oh, Ed the Pope.

[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:06.820]
The Pope.

[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.120]
It's Ross's warning.

[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:08.780]
No chance.

[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:10.400]
Sonny served.

[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.840]
Top snobbudgeri.

[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.220]
Bailey.

[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:12.720]
Bailey.

[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.680]
Unbridled with Pat Day is the Chalk Country Day with Valiente.

[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.260]
Rowanoke with Craig Perret.

[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:18.600]
Slavic.

[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:19.860]
I don't like that horse at all.

[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.720]
Single dawn with Lafitte Pink Eyes.

[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:22.400]
He's back riding.

[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.360]
He got injured, you know.

[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:23.760]
Yeah.

[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.060]
And run turn with Farraggo with the Rowanoke with the Craig Perret.

[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.320]
Rowanoke.

[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.300]
Yeah, just to be different.

[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.600]
Well, I got my bank book here and I'm going to take all my money out of my flagler federal today.

[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.640]
I'm going to put it on Rowanoke.

[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.140]
Excellent.

[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:35.780]
Okay.

[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.060]
Okay, good luck to you, sir.

[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:37.720]
Thanks a lot, Neil.

[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.480]
Just remember one thing.

[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:38.840]
What?

[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:40.600]
A fool and his money are soon parted.

[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.420]
Well, that's why I called you.

[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.000]
Good luck.

[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:43.540]
Bye-bye.

[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.360]
Okay, you'll need it.

[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.500]
Anyway, that's don't forget Derby Day.

[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.780]
The track opens at 9.30 tomorrow.

[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.700]
The gates in and the first race is early at noon because they've been on the track.

[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.420]
They've got the Florida Derby and all the festivities and the activities.

[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.980]
The big day of the year at Gulf Stream tomorrow is so get the whole family together and get out there.

[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:04.140]
Okay, and just, you know, like this guy, go to the bank today and take out your life savings and leave it all there tomorrow.

[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.360]
But you'll have a real good time.

[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:06.240]
Oh, look at that.

[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.040]
Aunt Rose is going to be on in the next hour.

[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:09.600]
That ought to be really fascinating.

[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:12.960]
We'll have a little time to kind of finish off the tale from yesterday.

[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.280]
So to speak, Henry Barrow's got the 11 o'clock WIOD news.

[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.700]
And then we'll come back.

[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:20.800]
Maybe Henry could be the PA announcer at Miracle Baseball.

[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.180]
They'll let him in that stadium anyway.

[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.600]
We'll come back at 11.05.

[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.500]

The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station.

[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:59.600]
Now, here's Neal Rogers on New Stock Radio 610 WIOD.

[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.020]
I have no life.

[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:13.860]
My name is Barry.

[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.960]
Sing like a fairy.

[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.760]
I write bad songs about romance.

[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.760]
While I'm wearing standard pants, I'm trying to shrink it.

[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.780]
My songs are with me.

[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.460]
I had a series of big hits.

[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.400]
But that was back in 76.

[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.320]
Now no one wants to hear.

[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.720]
They only laugh and steer.

[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:36.260]
They won't admit that they own my albums.

[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.140]
But my songs are queer.

[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.820]
Got a nose game.

[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:41.580]
Like a banana.

[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:46.100]
My two fans both live in my tenor.

[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.320]
Got a nose game.

[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.700]
Like a banana.

[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:57.160]
Of my notes you could fit half on the city of Atlanta.

[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.120]
I write the song.

[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.860]
Like a banana.

[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.540]
I've got a hunker.

[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.260]
The size of younger.

[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:16.480]
When I get a stuffed up nose, I be sad in a hoax.

[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.320]
But now I'm on the cake.

[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.660]
My life is back in place.

[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.160]
And so I'm singing again and sticky.

[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.820]
My snows in your face got a nose shape.

[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.500]
Like a banana.

[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:33.280]
My two fans both live in my tenor.

[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.360]
Got a nose shape.

[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.700]
Like a banana.

[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:44.280]
Of my notes you could fit half on the city of Atlanta.

[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.280]
I write the song.

[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.000]
Like a banana.

[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.280]
Like a banana.

[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.260]
Like a banana.

[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:07.920]
Like a banana.

[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:15.220]
Okay it's 1107 at WYOD and Aunt Rose is on the line.

[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:17.000]
I love that thing.

[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:17.960]
Hi.

[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:18.980]
How you doing?

[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.060]
Okay I know why Rick is so happy.

[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:22.000]
And why is that?

[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:23.660]
Well I can't blow any...

[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.760]
Something we can talk about.

[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.120]
No I can't blow any secrets.

[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.200]
I'm not touching at like this.

[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.280]
Just a joke.

[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.380]
I just like joking.

[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:34.620]
Okay.

[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:36.780]
Now where did we leave off yesterday?

[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:37.920]
You called at the end of the show.

[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:38.680]
We ran out of time.

[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:39.740]
Hold on a second Rose.

[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:40.760]
WYOD.

[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.200]
Yeah I'm on a car phone.

[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.640]
Oh jeez.

[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.900]
Hold on one second okay?

[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:45.560]
Good thing.

[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.240]
One second.

[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.480]
This guy says he's on a car phone Rose.

[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.020]
What do you think?

[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:49.660]
No problem.

[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.280]
Well if he is go right ahead.

[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.160]
Okay you sure?

[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:52.660]
Sure.

[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.780]
You're not going to be...

[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.020]
No I'm not under pressure anymore.

[00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:56.380]
Good.

[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:57.260]
Oh really?

[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.160]
Hold on.

[00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.540]
I guess she's free.

[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:00.780]
How you doing now?

[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:01.200]
Okay.

[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.740]
I'm calling from Bordam Beach.

[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:04.500]
From Bordam Beach?

[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.080]
Yeah.

[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.920]
I guess everyone else called this pointin beach.

[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:08.400]
What?

[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.860]
A horrible place.

[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:10.820]
A horrible place.

[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.580]
A horrible place.

[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.840]
If you want to boat in your yard move to Boynton Beach.

[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:14.900]
Yeah there it is.

[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:21.000]
Then you can have ducks in your yard and pick up trucks and shotguns and black cats.

[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:21.960]
I'm embarrassed.

[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.600]
Bumpin' that lady after that line.

[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.780]
That was a pretty good line.

[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:25.400]
Yeah.

[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:26.060]
Not bad.

[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.820]
Well listen she's been hanging out with that young stuff.

[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:29.600]
You know look out.

[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:30.620]
What can we say?

[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:31.080]

[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:32.360]
Anyhow.

[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:36.100]
I just call to say hello and see how things were going.

[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.480]
But let me get that lady back on.

[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.660]
She's down to real interest and I really have no material.

[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:41.260]
Okay.

[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.520]
Well you're a hell of a guy.

[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.200]
Have a good weekend.

[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:43.620]
Thank you.

[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.120]
Okay.

[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:45.220]
See wasn't that nice?

[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:45.960]
What a guy.

[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:46.440]
Yeah.

[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.280]
And if you're used by your material, it's easy to please.

[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.260]
Oh I'm telling you.

[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.900]
I think the state of Florida looks like a gun.

[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:55.660]
What do you think?

[00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:58.140]
A little bit of a gun with a shorthand?

[00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.180]
Uh-huh.

[00:42:59.460 --> 00:42:59.960]
Okay.

[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:00.260]
Okay.

[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.660]
Well there's always been something phallic about a gun.

[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:07.140]
All those national rifle association people.

[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.640]
You know all those guys that have to have their gun in their hand.

[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:09.860]
Yeah.

[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.280]
That's what I was for.

[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.720]
Something very, very deeply psychological about that.

[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.900]
Freud would be embarrassed.

[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:16.280]
Yes.

[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.000]
Deep citizenship functional feeling.

[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.120]
No.

[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:25.360]
The thing is, Jane Polly had an interview a show called Jane.

[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.920]
Why do you think they call it a sick shooter?

[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:27.520]
Rose.

[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:29.420]
Go ahead.

[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:30.300]
I don't know.

[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:31.600]
Uh-uh.

[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:32.560]
It was called changes.

[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:33.080]
Okay.

[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:35.020]
And they had one lady.

[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:38.120]
You work with the Camille House and I'm sure you appreciate this.

[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:40.360]
They talk about the changes of how people...

[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:41.820]
What changes...

[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.700]
What changes they go through, what they do with their lives.

[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:44.600]
And if...

[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.520]
Couple, they had...

[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.660]
They were very well off.

[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:53.940]
And they had a daughter that she grew up and they were happy but something seemed to be missing in their lives.

[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.940]
And what they did was...

[00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:58.960]
Oh, the lady worked...

[00:43:58.960 --> 00:43:59.280]
I'm sorry.

[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.040]
The lady works at an interior decorating place.

[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:07.300]
And she saw that these people were coming in and they had...

[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:11.240]
These ladies were losing sleep over what wallpaper do you use?

[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.780]
And like a flash, it came to her.

[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.980]
She said, those people out on the street losing sleep because they have nothing over their head.

[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:26.740]
And in other words, they just kind of stopped it all in and opened the shelters and were boyzies or something like that.

[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:33.620]
But what I needed to say was that there was quite a bit of positive and you know there have to be, you know, with the Camille House and stuff like that.

[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.620]
And I just...

[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:39.220]
I can't stand the festival that we're in but you know I have to look for the good.

[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:41.980]
Oh, this...

[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:42.780]
So philosophically...

[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.620]
I just needed to say that it really moved me.

[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:46.680]
It moved you?

[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.680]
It did. I wish you could have seen it. I think you would have appreciated it.

[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:50.180]
I'm sure would have.

[00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.360]
What the two people were doing for these people up in Idaho.

[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.880]
You were just very nice.

[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.800]
Well, you got to understand the whole world's an insane asylum. I mean, you don't understand.

[00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:59.940]
I know. And that's why I need to look for all that truth.

[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:04.620]
I mean, people are sleeping on the streets and I have neighbors who are worried that they can't have a boat in their room.

[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.940]
That's what the world has come to.

[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:11.880]
I know. That's why I wanted to not share this with you but tell you about that.

[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:13.860]
I needed to tell you about that.

[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:20.180]
And that's about it. And I just want to give it a positive note because there's so much negative and I just want to say something happy.

[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.500]
Well, wasn't that great?

[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.620]
Well, I hope so.

[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:23.660]
Well, Rick said...

[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:24.840]
I'll think of something better later.

[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.140]
Rick said, love and kisses.

[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.140]
Oh, and smoochies and smoochies.

[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:28.560]
Exactly.

[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:29.940]
Okay. He said he's ready.

[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.960]
No, you said I was ready.

[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.180]
Well, he said he's ready.

[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.060]
I guess everybody's ready, Rose.

[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:35.920]
We're all ready.

[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:36.680]
Have a great weekend.

[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.440]
You too. Bye.

[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:37.780]
Bye.

[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.860]
Wow. 12 minutes past 11 at WIOD.

[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.160]
We have an opening in Dade County.

[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.240]
Seven...

[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:47.320]
WIOD.

[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:47.980]
Hi.

[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:48.600]
Hi.

[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:49.060]
How you doing?

[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:49.580]
Okay.

[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.100]
Great.

[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:50.700]
Do you want to hold?

[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:51.220]
Sure.

[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.520]
Okay. Why are you so happy?

[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:54.540]
I don't know. I just am.

[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.580]
I'm just the first time that I've ever called and you've picked right up.

[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:58.280]
This is just amazing.

[00:45:58.420 --> 00:45:59.380]
Great. Well, hold on.

[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.100]
I'll make your way to WIOD and you come back to Err...

[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:02.280]
I'll inspect the good old days.

[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:02.620]
Okay.

[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.000]
Let's go.

[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.280]
It's coming across the time my pass is off to the top of the key taken by Julius.

[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.360]
He drives the stop.

[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.180]
Oh, I want to electrify one in it.

[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:16.140]
Windmill's there.

[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:17.320]
Windmill's there.

[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:17.800]
Hi.

[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.220]
This is the doctor.

[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.940]
And when I'm on a fast break from the usual breakfast routine, there's only one place for me.

[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.700]
Slam, dunk it, don't knock.

[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.880]
Check out the All Star lineup.

[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:33.840]
They got Dale Dawkins, Chocolate Thunder, Donuts, Wheels, Chamberlain, Finger Rolls, and even Moses Malone.

[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.000]
What had it jammed, feel, donut?

[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:37.420]
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:39.760]
Hey, Doc. How about a box and one to go?

[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:40.480]
Yeah, baby.

[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:41.680]
And give me a cup of coffee.

[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:42.600]
My one.

[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:43.640]
Medium one.

[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.440]
A Lodge of wine.

[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:46.440]
A Lodge of wine.

[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.920]
But no Korean, please.

[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.440]
Oh, that's bad.

[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.640]
So make your best move to slam, dunking, donut.

[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:55.080]
We stub off food in your face.

[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.540]
Okay, 1117 at WIOD and let's...

[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.480]
Oh, I know what it was, the soda.

[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.140]
Very simple.

[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.740]
Do you think that the Sherols got sodas and her thing?

[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.400]
See if there's anything in Sherols thing up there.

[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.200]
North Miami Beach.

[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:10.540]
Hello.

[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:11.280]
Hey, Neil.

[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:11.900]
Yeah.

[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.760]
Hey, I've been holding over an hour.

[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:14.420]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:16.020]
I wasn't going to do that other guy first.

[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.140]
Oh, you can't leave me holding any more.

[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:18.900]
All right, just a second.

[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:19.380]
Just a second.

[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:20.740]
You don't mind, do you?

[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:21.500]
No, not at all.

[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.740]
And you just called it anyway, right?

[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.040]
This is...

[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.340]
I'm still not over yet, so please.

[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:26.580]
Yeah, so what the hell do you want?

[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.300]
Okay, hold on.

[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:28.540]
Okay, he's the wait.

[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:29.140]
And he just called.

[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.100]
Oh, hey, Neil.

[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:32.500]
I've been holding since at least an hour.

[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:33.300]
Really?

[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:34.040]
Yeah.

[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.480]
Well, I must be getting a kind of black and blue by now, huh?

[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:37.360]
Hey, well...

[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:37.780]
The phone, I mean.

[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:40.300]
I'm your listener from BCC.

[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.480]
Great, you're the only one we got left.

[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.260]
Yeah, my name is Larry, by the way.

[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.100]
Well, that's good, Larry.

[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:48.220]
Everybody wants to be a big celebrity in a superstar and now you're a writ.

[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:48.900]
Oh, thanks.

[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:49.600]
You're writ, Larry.

[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.580]
Well, I just wanted to say, I, you know, I've been holding an hour.

[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:53.600]
I haven't even done what you say.

[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:54.080]
Yeah.

[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:55.580]
Well, that's why we didn't get to you.

[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.380]
We knew you didn't have anything to show here from BCC.

[00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:58.560]
What do you made you're in shop?

[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.440]
I don't know.

[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.580]
Oh, oh, you're just hanging out there.

[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.080]
Yeah.

[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:04.240]
Like most of those kids.

[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:06.280]
What do people take at BCC?

[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.820]
Like wind surfing and basket weaving?

[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:09.840]
Window washing.

[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:10.400]
Shop?

[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:11.240]
Yeah.

[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.460]
Do you know kids who took shop in high school?

[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.260]
Yeah, I was one of them.

[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:15.540]
Did you?

[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.680]
Yeah, and I'm Jewish, can you believe that?

[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:18.540]
Oh, no.

[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:20.400]
Here's a Jewish kid who took shop.

[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.800]
Thank you, Marvin, in high school.

[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:22.860]
Oh, God.

[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.760]
Oh, you are really a reject from the human race.

[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.920]
No, seriously, a lot of kids are not too bright

[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.940]
and they're going to be, but they are mechanically inclined.

[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:30.640]
And they take shop.

[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:31.700]
There's nothing wrong with that.

[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.720]
And then all the rest of us kids used to like line up and laugh at them.

[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:38.220]
Oh, look at that. He's doing wood weaving and woodworking and...

[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:38.920]
And cross building.

[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.360]
Well, somebody's got to do that manual stuff, okay?

[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.900]
But, geez, Jews doing manual labor, Larry.

[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:45.080]
What kind of stuff is that?

[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:45.940]
I don't know.

[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:46.480]
Boy.

[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.700]
Well, you know what the penance looks like?

[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.140]
Well, be careful now.

[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:52.060]
Okay.

[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:52.740]
What is it?

[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.920]
It looks like we're urinating on Cuba.

[00:48:55.780 --> 00:49:00.100]
Well, there are a lot of people who'd be happy to do that as long as they're illiterate.

[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:01.920]
Well, just wanted to pass that along.

[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:02.380]
I'll bet.

[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:04.840]
Well, listen, Larry, you've been quite a caller now.

[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:07.260]
I want you to do a little assignment next week, okay?

[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:10.160]
Because back in the Zaytadays, we were really hot at BCC.

[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:11.120]
But we had everybody.

[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:12.380]
We had... we had them all.

[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.440]
Well, I'm on spring break this week and there's absolutely nothing to do.

[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:16.080]
Oh, really?

[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:17.660]
Oh, is everybody on break this week?

[00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:18.660]
From BCC.

[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.680]
Let's see, it's March 16th.

[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.620]
Yeah, they're all up in Daytona and in Mexico.

[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:23.280]
Right.

[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.640]
And in Texas and all other kind of places, but not here.

[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:27.960]
Nothing to do except to go through shuffleboard.

[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:28.460]
Yeah.

[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.900]
Well, you'd probably be good at that.

[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:30.880]
You're mechanically inclined.

[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.840]
You could get that little thing right whereup along.

[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.420]
So, you know what I mean, Larry?

[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:35.100]
I know.

[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:35.740]
Catch my drift.

[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.400]
Well, listen, have a great weekend and when...

[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.640]
No, when does school go back again?

[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.040]
This Monday, I was off this whole week.

[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.960]
All right, your assignment is to scour up other Nileys at BCC.

[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:46.180]
That just... maybe you can get some of them to call in.

[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.460]
I'll let you know next week.

[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.160]
I don't think you'll have...

[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.860]
I don't think you'll have much success, but give it a shot.

[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:50.360]
Okay.

[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:51.520]
Well, don't lose it, Neil.

[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.880]
Well, and the same to you.

[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:53.320]
Okay.

[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:53.880]
Take care.

[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:54.180]
See you.

[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.520]
Well, look at that.

[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.720]
Somebody who takes shop who closes the call by saying,

[00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:58.980]
Zagazone, how do you like that?

[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:01.500]
What the hell is this world coming to anyway, huh?

[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.820]
And that Yitzhak Shamir?

[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:05.820]
I don't like... he's a little puny guy.

[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:06.500]
I don't like him anyway.

[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:07.940]
He's got a crappy attitude, you know?

[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:13.020]
Sometimes I feel...

[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.800]
Sometimes I feel...

[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:16.260]
I feel...

[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:18.600]
Anyway, let's look at the guest list for the Alex Bennett Show.

[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:22.360]
But I tell you what, I want to see a tremendous studio audience in here.

[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:22.820]
It's Friday.

[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.760]
We got all the college kids who are out on break.

[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:28.440]
Most of them haven't got a damn thing to do because there's nobody in town.

[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:30.720]
You notice the season never happened here this year.

[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:32.660]
The only thing we got was traffic, but no business.

[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.020]
Everybody tells me that.

[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:35.820]
Where's the season?

[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:36.740]
When is it starting?

[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.200]
I hate to break the news to you, but it never showed up.

[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:44.780]
Anyway, film critic Mike Snyder, a Sean O'Connor for St. Patty's Day

[00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:46.560]
and the lookalikes, whatever that is,

[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.260]
and then Comic-Con, Kevin Meeney,

[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:52.220]
the rock band Nuclear Valdez, and many more guestises.

[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:53.500]
How many more guests can there be?

[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:58.720]
So let's have a gigantic tumultuous, overflowing studio audience

[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.420]
for the Alex Bennett Show today.

[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.300]
Come on down and just hang out, okay?

[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:07.600]
Let's get the season, tough to fire your feet.

[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.820]
This is the Neorajer Show.

[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:11.500]
Whoo!

[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:12.400]
It's...

[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.060]
This is the Joy Reynolds Show.

[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.680]
Any questions?

[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:30.160]
Who did that?

[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:36.200]
Oh, good idea, but the execution isn't...

[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.720]
Like they said with Ted Bundy, the execution isn't quite there.

[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:42.040]
Anyway, we have it opening in Broward at 524WID.

[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:44.400]
That's an at line 6 where somebody just got cut off.

[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.060]
Kendall!

[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:45.800]
Nail.

[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:46.220]
Yeah.

[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:47.020]
How you doing?

[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:47.540]
Okay.

[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:48.560]
That's really cool.

[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.500]
I'll just say it for the OV burrito surprise with beans.

[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:52.720]
Great, or with beans?

[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:53.680]
You know what that means?

[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:54.880]
Yeah, I do know what that means.

[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:00.420]
Okay.

[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.840]
27 after 11 at WIOD.

[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.740]
Let's go to beautiful Pompo-no, hello.

[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:05.680]
Nail.

[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:06.240]
Yes.

[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.020]
Little me $50.

[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:07.860]
Come on.

[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:08.500]
Okay.

[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.240]
Here with it.

[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.200]
I'm a little larger from England.

[00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:13.520]
Your mother, I bet she's a hell of a cook, huh?

[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.360]
Oh, she's...

[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:17.840]
Oh yeah, if it has tasted, it means that somebody made a mistake.

[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.060]
Don't be such a loud.

[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:19.820]
You got it.

[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:24.720]
Listen, she says you're rude and you'd be thrown off for any one five minutes.

[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:26.420]
That's not rude.

[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:28.080]
We'll call you a douchebag.

[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:28.460]
Yeah.

[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:29.360]
Her name is Connie.

[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:30.200]
Would you do it for me?

[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:30.980]
She is a douchebag.

[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:31.680]
Connie, the worst.

[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:32.520]
Thank you.

[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.320]
Plus you couldn't cook a bean.

[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:37.280]
You know, pot.

[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.560]
The only thing she makes any good is your chip pudding.

[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:41.440]
Oh yeah.

[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:43.660]
I have no comment on that.

[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:43.880]
Yes.

[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.380]
And listen, I was in the bathroom before taking a shower.

[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:47.840]
Yeah.

[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:49.680]
I looked down and I saw the state of Florida.

[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:50.560]
I believe it.

[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:52.040]
Okay.

[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:53.580]
Just a member of Panhandle.

[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:54.540]
Panhandle, right?

[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:55.100]
See you later.

[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:55.780]
Could you give me a favor?

[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:56.480]
Yes.

[00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.860]
If you get a chance, would you play that Donald Trump song?

[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:01.080]
Oh sure.

[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:01.620]
Okay.

[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:02.500]
Yeah, it takes up two minutes.

[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:03.000]
Okay.

[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:03.520]
See ya.

[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:04.160]
Thanks for that.

[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.340]
Oh yeah, we'll play that.

[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.240]
Anything that's long.

[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:07.420]
Like the state of Florida.

[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:11.280]
It's 28 after 11 at WIOD.

[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.460]
That was Pompano.

[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:14.320]
Let's go to plantation.

[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.420]
11, 28 with Ron Sageon.

[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.600]
Hey, why are you on your music?

[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.420]
Where the fist for if it continues?

[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.980]
This guy with a grassroots man.

[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:42.680]
Let's play the whole thing.

[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:45.840]
What is that?

[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:49.800]
Oh, it's Gary's birthday.

[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:52.280]
It's not great.

[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:14.460]
Okay.

[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:14.700]
Okay.

[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:14.820]
I know.

[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:15.540]
Okay.

[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:18.000]
Let's put Ron Sageon on a hold there for just a second.

[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.500]
He's on your music way.

[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.080]
A1A.

[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.260]
Uh, I know.

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.260]

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.260]

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.260]

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.260]

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.260]

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.260]

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.260]

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.260]

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.260]

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.260]

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.260]

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.260]

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.260]

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.260]

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:25.820]
Hello, I'm a lady on the sixth in Miami on the Broward Line getting very confusing.

[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:26.200]
Hello.

[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:27.620]
Hello, is this Neil?

[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:28.440]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:31.020]
Yeah, listen, I have a story to tell.

[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:35.000]
I was in New York on the eighth last week.

[00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:35.880]
You were in New York?

[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:36.620]
Yeah.

[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.680]
And I was in the audience on the Phil Donahue show.

[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:46.580]
And they had as their guest and as their topic, two live crew.

[00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:48.860]
And they performed their song.

[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:49.520]
Yeah.

[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:56.920]
And I don't think that the songs were edited at least at the time or in any way.

[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:58.840]
And they had a panel discussion.

[00:54:59.320 --> 00:54:59.520]
Okay.

[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:03.440]
And they mentioned Martinez and they mentioned the situation in Broward.

[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:11.240]
And I called Channel 10 when I got back and said, when are you going to, you know, basically, when are you going to air the show?

[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:17.200]
You know, I called him this morning because it hadn't been aired in Miami because I've been watching every day.

[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:17.680]
Yeah.

[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:23.940]
And Channel 10 told me, normally they air the following day, which would have been last Friday.

[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:24.340]

[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.500]
So I'm sitting here saying, what's going on?

[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:31.220]
Why aren't they airing this show in Miami?

[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.660]
And they're not giving you a reason?

[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:40.200]
No, they told me to call back on Monday and see whether, you know, it was going to be scheduled for next week.

[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:43.380]
So it sounds pretty evasive to me.

[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.740]
That was a little fishy, doesn't it?

[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:45.020]
Yeah.

[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:49.640]
So I just thought I'd call and tell my story and see if anybody knows anything about it.

[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:50.380]
I don't get it.

[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:53.900]
You think that they'd want to have that on its local timely?

[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:54.680]
I know.

[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.640]
And I don't know what the problem is.

[00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:03.020]
The only thing that I can think of is, I mean, the lyrics to the song were rather, let's say, we're going to...

[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:04.820]
Well, there's no way that they would let it go.

[00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:08.480]
Anything that was risque would be dumped anyway because it's, you know, on tape.

[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:09.320]
Yeah.

[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:09.760]
We'll see.

[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:15.000]
When I heard it live, tape during the taping, I said to myself, I can't believe they're going to put this over there.

[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:15.800]
They're not.

[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.700]
But then I thought maybe they're going to believe it.

[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:18.820]
You know what I mean?

[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.340]
Yeah, dump it.

[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:25.140]
But there's, you know, so I don't know if the show's been aired all over the country and just not in Miami.

[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:27.840]
Or I don't know what the situation is.

[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:31.540]
Well, I saw a promo for it on maybe it was on my satellite.

[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:32.840]
I don't know what channel I was watching.

[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:34.860]
I did not see the show, but I saw a promo.

[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:37.760]
So it sure aired someplace.

[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:38.800]
Yeah.

[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:40.740]
So I don't know what's going on.

[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:41.600]
Well, we'll find out.

[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:42.700]
We'll get to the bottom of it.

[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:43.380]
Where are you really?

[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.620]
Even if we have to jump into Anbishop's truck.

[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:47.320]
We'll find out.

[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:48.140]

[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:49.400]
I would appreciate it.

[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:49.640]
Okay.

[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:50.280]
Thanks a lot.

[00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:50.660]
Bye.

[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:53.200]
It's 11.32 at WIO Dean.

[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.480]
We have it opening in Broward.

[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:59.240]
If you move very fast now, 524, Judge Grossman, 524, WIOD.

[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:00.640]
How you doing, is this Marvin?

[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:01.200]
Yeah.

[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:02.040]
How you doing, Marvin?

[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:02.380]
Let's see.

[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:03.280]
It's who?

[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:03.800]
Ken.

[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:04.620]
Oh, Ken.

[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:05.140]
How you doing?

[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:06.260]
Ken O.

[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:07.120]
Ken Hall.

[00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:07.620]
Oh.

[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.040]
I sat in there with you one time.

[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:09.640]
Okay.

[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:13.360]
Terry Mariamann's by report.

[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:13.660]
Okay.

[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:14.140]
Hold on, Ken.

[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:14.500]
Okay.

[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:16.360]
Let's leave him on hold for a long time.

[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:18.080]
Plantation?

[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.000]
Yes.

[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:20.240]
It's 11.30 at WIO.

[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:20.760]
Holy crap.

[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:21.680]
We're going to stay quain.

[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:23.180]
A1A with Ron C.

[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:23.540]
Yeah.

[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:27.540]
Come on, Ron.

[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:28.640]
You can do the talk up.

[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.200]
Boys 9-0, man.

[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:32.960]
He's going to reach your record.

[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.140]
He runs those nut to a muscle in there.

[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:37.580]
He knows to let the old pro handle all the talk ups.

[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:38.800]
Don't step on it.

[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.240]
I'm all the world man.

[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.580]
You know, digging, you'll be dead.

[00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:43.540]
You'll be dead.

[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.160]
One thing about Ron St. John.

[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:46.800]
He's into the guest who, big time, isn't he?

[00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:48.500]
11.30 at WIO.

[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:49.640]
D's got good taste.

[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:50.860]
Miami.

[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:51.280]
Hello.

[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:51.780]
Hey there.

[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:52.460]
How you doing?

[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:53.800]
Oh, you're still there, right?

[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:54.300]
Yes, I am.

[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:54.580]
Boy.

[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.600]
But I've got a couple things to concede.

[00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:57.480]
You have a couple things?

[00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:58.320]
Well, that's good.

[00:57:58.840 --> 00:57:59.820]
That's a good start.

[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:02.760]
My first thing is shape like Florida.

[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:03.500]
Yes.

[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:06.900]
Along the lines of that Donnie who, lady, who called.

[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:12.680]
I think some of these right wing fundamentalist types need to keep an eye on other things than

[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:13.500]
the radio and TV.

[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:19.420]
I work for an international parcel delivery company.

[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:23.980]
The initials are PUS but not necessarily in that order.

[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:24.320]
Hmm.

[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:26.380]
And I see you.

[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:27.020]
Yes.

[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.060]
Well, that's appetizing right before lunch at school.

[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:30.900]
Well, anyway.

[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:31.300]
Who is that?

[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:32.900]
Is that Val's child that you got there?

[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:33.560]
That's mine.

[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:34.000]
Oh.

[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:35.520]
Screaming has had off.

[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:40.940]
Anyway, I received numerous packages from questionable companies.

[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:47.320]
Actually going to questionable companies, they have somewhat explicit suggestive names.

[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:50.400]
And every now and then I can call you and let you in on one of them.

[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:55.360]
Today, one of them I noticed was called, KO For Men.

[00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:57.980]
I don't know.

[00:58:58.580 --> 00:58:59.420]
Make what you want of it.

[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.080]
No, that's alligator tail.

[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:01.980]
I guess so.

[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:03.680]
Yeah, that's frozen, go make a scene.

[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:04.920]
They get lots of packages.

[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:05.760]
Let me tell you.

[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:05.920]
Huh.

[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.640]
So what's wrong with that?

[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:09.320]
What's wrong with that?

[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:13.420]
Well, hey, what's wrong with the little tail going on here and look at these people losing their minds?

[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:16.780]
Well, listen, you can't, you can't, you can't, oh, just relax.

[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.840]
Okay, you can't deal with those people.

[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:23.160]
They're immovable and intractable and they'll kill you with their kindness and they got all the answers.

[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:27.840]
The only problem in the countries that all the other people are like laying down and sleeping.

[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:28.540]
That's the problem.

[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:33.840]
They've all gone into a coma, all our great liberal and moderate friends and all these people are having a field day.

[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:34.460]
That's what I mean.

[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:34.960]
Yeah.

[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:38.740]
That's just a modest proposal to keep an eye on the mail system as ridiculous as possible.

[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:41.660]
We're going to even have to start censoring the cartoons on Sunday morning.

[00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:42.080]
Exactly.

[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:45.020]
You know, you can't keep control over everything.

[00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:48.060]
Tony Dow is upset because they want to censor the reruns of leave it to beaver.

[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:50.860]
They think it has a suggested title, yeah.

[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:51.940]
Leave it to the other hand.

[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:56.940]
The other thing is you're complaining about a week or so ago about no advertising and it's true.

[00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:58.740]
I don't see any advertising for your show.

[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.440]
No, no, wait a minute.

[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:02.140]
Let's clarify.

[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:03.680]
There's a lot of advertising on the show.

[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:04.320]
You mean no promotion?

[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.580]
No, this doesn't promote anything except the morning show.

[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:07.960]
Right.

[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:10.340]
There's hardly any promotion for the neorodges program.

[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:14.640]
No, I don't say that out of peak toward Mike because Mike and I get along great and he does a good job and all of that.

[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.940]
But you know, they only promote one show which is kind of bizarre.

[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:18.440]
Right.

[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:23.980]
Well, if you're getting with the little amount of promotion that you're getting, this could upset you.

[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:25.300]
So, power 96.

[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:30.240]
I saw a Metro bus advertising for Kramer, the midday man, the other day.

[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:30.620]
Oh.

[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:31.880]
I know.

[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.320]
It was kind of a...

[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:33.560]
Oh.

[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:34.160]
Yeah.

[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.240]
You would have thought they would have taken care of that.

[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:37.760]
That is tacky.

[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.900]
Well, listen, now that you've revealed that, they really got to give me one of those records.

[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:43.880]
That is, horrendous grotesque.

[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:44.400]
Anyway.

[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:46.120]
Okay.

[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.680]
Well, listen, you really got me a depress now.

[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:49.360]
Have a great weekend.

[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:50.420]
You too.

[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:50.780]
See ya.

[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:51.600]
Yes.

[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.380]
6, 10, 12, 5, 6, 10.

[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.540]
Just you by your peak.

[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:56.300]

[01:00:58.340 --> 01:00:58.340]

[01:00:59.480 --> 01:00:59.480]

[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:00.500]

[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:00.780]
Mmm.

[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:12.880]
Trump, the monster ego, lived like a king and trollicked with some new biolchicks and had himself a fleeing.

[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.380]
Little wife, Viva, no.

[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.080]
Sood that a rascal, Trump.

[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:25.540]
And soothed the house and 20 mill and other fancy stuff.

[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:28.900]
Oh, together they would shut her.

[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.980]
Buying anything for sale.

[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:38.700]
Viva, no, kept a look out, purged while Trump went out for sale.

[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:45.040]
Starlit spam sendin' bows would bow when air he came.

[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.060]
I rate Pimps would lower their price when Trump roared out his name.

[01:01:51.520 --> 01:02:03.660]
Oh, Trump, the monster ego, lived like a king and trollicked with some new biolchicks and had himself a fleeing.

[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:10.120]
Then one night it happened, all the papers gave the score.

[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:16.580]
Trump's game was a doldery to Viva and her disment war.

[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:22.560]
Castles and casinos, Trump would all retain.

[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:29.240]
Porri Viva and her got the shaft, pre-knuffed shows made it plain.

[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:35.480]
Without his lifelong friend, his marriage on the shelf.

[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:41.760]
Then Trump's that monster ego gladly made love to himself.

[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:54.560]
Oh, Trump, the monster ego, lived like a king and trollicked with some new biolchicks and had himself a fleeing.

[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:08.960]
Trump, the monster ego, lived like a king and trollicked with some new biolchicks and had himself a fleeing.

[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:15.120]
11.41 at WIOND, we have an opening in date, county, I can't believe it, 751.

[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.720]
Trump, 751, WIOND, what do you think, Ron?

[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:21.920]
11.43 at A1A, and a new district.

[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.520]
Ron, Ron, Ron.

[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:26.820]
11.42.

[01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:31.760]
Ron. He left me in an untenable position there, Ron.

[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:35.440]
Don't ever do that again, okay? WIOND.

[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.040]
I stepped all over the Buckingham, sure.

[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.380]
Excuse me?

[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:42.720]
Don't worry about it, just try to keep up with this.

[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:43.340]
All right.

[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:44.040]
What's going on?

[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.980]
Yeah, Neil said to Kalka, anybody that took shop?

[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.240]
This is Neil.

[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:51.160]
No, it's not.

[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.080]
Yes, it is.

[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:52.840]
It is?

[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:53.660]
Trust me.

[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:54.400]
Would I kid you?

[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:56.140]
Well, yes, you would, actually.

[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.840]
Would I yank your chain?

[01:03:58.960 --> 01:03:59.180]
Well.

[01:03:59.480 --> 01:03:59.800]
Possible.

[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.460]
So anyway, you took shop?

[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:01.980]
Yeah.

[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:02.880]
So what's wrong with that?

[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.460]
Well, I'm asking you.

[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:05.840]
I don't think anything's wrong with it.

[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.260]
I think you have to stand up and be a man, right?

[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:09.560]
Well, yeah, I guess so.

[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:10.360]
What do you do for a living?

[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:11.660]
I'm going to school.

[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:12.560]
Oh, you go to school?

[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:12.840]
Yeah.

[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:13.660]
So what's wrong with that?

[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.520]
I'm in high school.

[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:15.660]
Well, you're in high school.

[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:16.000]
Yeah.

[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:16.840]
You're out of school today?

[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.460]
No, I just came home for lunch.

[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:19.140]
Oh, good.

[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:19.760]
Yeah.

[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:21.660]
Just I had a catch you on the radio.

[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:22.500]
Well, that's good.

[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.520]
That's an excellent lunch hour to listen to this show, right?

[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:25.780]
I'm one of the very few.

[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.340]
Now, how do you know that?

[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.540]
Why do you tell your friends you listen and they make faces

[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:31.720]
and they tell you your number one and stuff like that?

[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:32.460]
Oh, no.

[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.880]
It's just that in my school, you know, it's a lot of power.

[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:35.420]
I need to take care of that.

[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:37.060]
Yeah, all that crap, man.

[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.860]
It's enough to pollute your brain, right?

[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:39.360]
Yeah.

[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:40.700]
Who needs that garbage?

[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:41.320]
Yeah.

[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:41.720]
Well.

[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.460]
Well, that's good taking shop.

[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.780]
You don't have a lot of pressure, right?

[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.300]
Well, just everybody likes to, you know.

[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.360]
Just two projects and all that kind of good stuff.

[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:49.640]
Yeah.

[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.180]
It's not so bad to me to tell you.

[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:51.640]
Yeah.

[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.760]
Kind of work on cars?

[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:54.860]
Yeah, I get to work on cars and all that.

[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.860]
Learn how to hot rod cars, steal a few forrari's and stuff like that.

[01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.740]
You can be retired by the time you're 25.

[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.180]
Actually, Mercedes, but you're...

[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:01.700]
Oh, there you go.

[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:02.300]
That's not bad.

[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:02.740]
It's okay.

[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:04.700]
You know where to sell them, huh?

[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:05.260]
Yeah.

[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.720]
All of a sudden have a wonderful day and a great week.

[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:08.240]
What's good?

[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:08.880]
What's good to go to?

[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:10.120]
Well, self-manmy senior high.

[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.020]
Oh, outstanding.

[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:11.940]
All right.

[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:12.660]
It is.

[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:13.260]
Okay, me.

[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.460]
One of the all-time greats.

[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:14.820]
Yeah.

[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:16.820]
Say hi to all my pal over there, okay?

[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:17.240]
All right.

[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:17.800]
Have a good one.

[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:18.080]
Okay.

[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:18.400]
Five.

[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:19.240]
How do you like that?

[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:23.180]
1143 at WIOD, the home of the free and the land of the grave.

[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.780]
And that's where we are folks.

[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.600]
It's dead town.

[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.780]
There's spring break going on in Daytona.

[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:31.900]
But we have the senior break here.

[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:35.300]
They're all out there with their metamuse soul and their walkers

[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:38.200]
and their kale pectate and their sweet and low.

[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:42.120]
And they're all making life miserable for everybody else.

[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.860]
That's Florida ladies and gentlemen.

[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:44.780]
Look at the map.

[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:47.020]
It's shaped like a big phallic thing.

[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:51.360]
And if you live here, you get a giant screwing at no extra charge.

[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.820]
See, that's why Alex came here.

[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:56.980]
Is he heard that and he didn't understand what they were talking about?

[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.520]
It's 16-till new in the WIOD, right, Ron?

[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:01.780]
Yeah, they've got it right on the one hand.

[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:02.540]
You're music way.

[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:03.620]
11-4-E, Jack.

[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.260]
Today I'll hear his cutting of branches.

[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:11.000]
Oh, from spring break.

[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.600]
Okay, all those kids who are out there at Fort Lauderdale.

[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:15.960]
Close your eyes and pretend.

[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:21.040]
Oh, this is great.

[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:23.120]
See, Ron, let's me do the talk-up.

[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:24.100]
That's what I really appreciate.

[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.420]
Ricky Tiki would never do that.

[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.980]
He'd have to do the talk-up himself.

[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:29.300]
It's 16-till noon.

[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:30.500]
And let's go...

[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.920]
Remember where the boys are for Lauderdale in 1956?

[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.820]
Spring break, people living and breathing.

[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:36.200]
Just a few years ago, I remember.

[01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:39.300]
Just wall-to-wall people all out of the age of 100.

[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:40.260]
I don't know if you're going to have a good time.

[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.900]
You know, a little crazy, but what the hell?

[01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:44.520]
We don't want that here.

[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.100]
We want senior break.

[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.760]
We want to have them out there in their little golf shorts

[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.840]
and their caps in the South Florida uniform

[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.880]
with their blue hair flowing out from underneath.

[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:55.480]
Let's go to West Palm Beach, shall we?

[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:56.160]
Uh-huh.

[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:58.740]
Neil, did you listen to...

[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.720]
Is this a call from Cemetery Village?

[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:04.040]
Oh, it's almost time for the Maasjog tournament.

[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.120]
It's Faldi.

[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.140]
Don't miss out.

[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:07.520]
Do you remember...

[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:10.840]
Did you listen to Alexio yesterday about three o'clock

[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:13.700]
the guy that laid into the bird, calls him up?

[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:14.800]
I mentioned that before.

[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:15.980]
I'm way ahead of you.

[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:16.780]
I even played the card.

[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.300]
I hate the bird, yeah.

[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:19.140]
No, that was great.

[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.960]
You could recognize that voice anywhere, couldn't you?

[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.740]
Listen, how come we never see Peggy Lewis

[01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:24.400]
and Manuel Noria get the same time?

[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:25.280]
Well, that's a good question.

[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:26.840]
The same reason you never see Ann Bishop

[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.980]
and I'm trying to think of a good one here.

[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.520]
Martina and Avartel over together.

[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:33.900]
Well, listen, I want to call my friend Tim and Nugget

[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:36.340]
and Kenny DiAtolla and my wife, Len, I'll do special.

[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:37.360]
Okay, thank you.

[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:37.780]
See ya.

[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.860]
It's 1146 here at WIO Dean

[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:45.000]
and we have it opening in Palm Beach at 655-9463.

[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:47.140]
655-WIOD.

[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:48.400]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:49.220]
Hi, Neil.

[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:49.820]
How are you?

[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:50.620]
I'm fine.

[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:52.520]
Guess what I've got.

[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:54.540]
This is a lady?

[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:57.860]
This is Ms. Globettelli.

[01:07:58.660 --> 01:07:58.900]
Oh!

[01:07:59.340 --> 01:07:59.760]
Hi, Neil.

[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.100]
Oh, you're sure putting on a good voice for today.

[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:02.880]
Oh, I have lots of them.

[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:03.500]
Do you?

[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:05.420]
Yeah, I'm about 10 of your callers.

[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:06.980]
Come on.

[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.660]
Sometimes I think there are only about three callers out there

[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:10.620]
and just do voices.

[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:11.620]
You know, they do stick.

[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.760]
Oh, I did me West once.

[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:14.280]
Did you?

[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:14.740]
Yeah.

[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.040]
Well, how was it?

[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:21.580]
Well, don't tell us, don't tell us.

[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:21.760]
It was pretty good.

[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.240]
Let everybody fantasize.

[01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:25.160]
Okay, well, guess what I taped yesterday.

[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:26.300]
I'm afraid to ask.

[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.420]
I taped the conversation between Alex

[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:30.600]
and that guy that did the bird call.

[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:31.700]
Oh, do you have it?

[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:32.600]
I have it.

[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:33.020]
Great.

[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:33.920]
Would you like to hear it?

[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:34.540]
Oh, I'd love it.

[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:35.220]
Okay.

[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:35.960]
Hold on.

[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:38.360]
Keep in mind who this is now.

[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:41.920]
Okay, yeah.

[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:43.000]
No, he does.

[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:43.500]
He does.

[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:44.280]
Really, he does.

[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.880]
How many of you think I suck more than Steve?

[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:46.020]
Yeah.

[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.840]
How many of you think I suck less than Steve?

[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:48.180]

[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.300]
Let's look at the suck meter right now here.

[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:54.020]
Steve Kane was entertaining.

[01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.840]
Here's his entertaining, them boring, his tail.

[01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.340]
Intertaining, boring, his tail.

[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:01.340]
Hey, you're not going to have to put up with me much longer.

[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:03.140]
Well, that's what my call was about.

[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:04.700]
That is why I'm calling.

[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:05.780]
Where are you going?

[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:06.500]
What are you doing?

[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:07.860]
I'm going back to San Francisco.

[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:08.880]
You're kidding.

[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:09.620]
Why'd you come?

[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.280]
Or why did you come?

[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:13.060]
I was, I find it very enjoyable.

[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:13.760]
Okay?

[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:18.720]
No, but why did you bring yourself down here?

[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:24.040]
Because I assumed that there was an intelligent population down here,

[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:27.500]
ready to be given high quality radio entertainment.

[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:28.400]
Oh, come on.

[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.820]
I was sadly mistaken.

[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:31.260]
So you're running back home?

[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:34.140]
And when I'm gone, you know, who's replacing me?

[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:35.420]
I'm just figuring it out now.

[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:36.420]
Kane, all right.

[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.360]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:39.840]
Sorry, you're not that lucky.

[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.740]
It's going to be a, they're going to put a team in here.

[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:44.800]
Dick Farrell and Joey Reynolds.

[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.120]
What about Gilbert?

[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:46.760]
Huh?

[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:47.600]
What about Gilbert?

[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:48.420]
Gilbert?

[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:51.300]
No, Gilbert is not a radio personality.

[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.240]
Oh, well, I don't know.

[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:54.360]
He's sort of entertaining.

[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:54.600]

[01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:55.820]
You're really running away?

[01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:56.600]
Well, me, I say.

[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.000]
Oh, now he's really running away.

[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:02.020]
Well, I mean, you come down here a few people call and say,

[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:03.420]
you stuck, so you run home.

[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.820]
I mean, that just causes commotion.

[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:08.020]
That's what, you know, you're supposed to do.

[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.520]
That's what, you know, I mean, the more commotion,

[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.660]
the better your ratings, you know,

[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.980]
I mean, why haven't I listened to you all during my career?

[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.220]
No, when I needed you to make it big.

[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.360]
Well, I can help you.

[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.060]
I can help you.

[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:19.660]
Yeah.

[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:21.580]
He's the one.

[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:23.920]
What did he say that being a Cayman and then he'd suck?

[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.900]
Well, I think it's because people like you calling

[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:27.160]
over the flip times.

[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:27.620]
Sorry.

[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:28.340]
You're a sweetheart.

[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:28.920]
Yeah.

[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:30.640]
Where'd she come from?

[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.780]
She's from San Francisco.

[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:32.880]
Can't you tell?

[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:34.640]
Yeah, go on back there.

[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:35.780]
She is going back here.

[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:37.040]
I thought you said she was funny.

[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:38.020]
Is this who is this?

[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:38.700]
Gary.

[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:40.700]
No, this is Boris.

[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:41.460]
Boris.

[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:42.900]
Yes, this is Boris.

[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:44.360]
Is it Boris?

[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:45.580]
Call me what you like.

[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:47.940]
I mean, can we, can we, can we like block his call?

[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:50.640]
No, we can never call the station again.

[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:51.980]
Why would you want to do that?

[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:52.740]
I think we'll do that.

[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:53.260]
Let's do it.

[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:54.500]
Why would you want to do that?

[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.440]
This block is called.

[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:56.540]
I mean, not that I...

[01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:57.100]
Do I suck?

[01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:57.940]
Not that I...

[01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:58.980]
Do I want to haul this again?

[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.320]
You can get out of this.

[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:03.100]
We can either block your call or you can tell me I don't suck.

[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.500]
Okay, honestly, you suck.

[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.080]
Okay, block his call.

[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:08.460]
Block his call.

[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:09.400]
He's blocked me.

[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:10.540]
I don't have a block.

[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:11.460]
I have to lie.

[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:12.680]
I have to live with myself.

[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.280]
Okay, excellent job, Gary.

[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.240]
It's 1149 at WIOD.

[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.180]
We have an opening in Dade County where Guava Jelly just hung up.

[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:24.560]
751-946-3751-WIOD.

[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.140]
Hey, one, hey, I've got a dedication from Mayor Fort Lauderdale.

[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:29.540]
Remember this Mayor Cox?

[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:46.940]
Oh, right here on the best there's no question about it.

[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:50.160]
Okay, more big hits from Rods A. John and just a minute or two.

[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:52.320]
But I wish he'd fix his watch.

[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:30.160]
Okay, if you're Gary Hart, a big price you'll pay it with women you play.

[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.160]
Not once, it was twice.

[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.160]
You were caught with Miss Rice.

[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.540]
You're really not too smart.

[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:45.100]
If you can't stay apart, now you won't be president.

[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:47.160]
Gary Hart.

[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.780]
You won't be the president.

[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.920]
No, Gary Hart.

[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:57.800]
What a rendition.

[01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:00.780]
That guy ought to be on the Alex Bennett's ocean, didn't he?

[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:03.540]
With Eric Flambert and Larry Brendler.

[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.240]
It's 1155 at WIOD.

[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:08.300]
Here's a mobile on I-95.

[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:09.540]
Hey, Neil.

[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:10.100]
Yeah.

[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:13.040]
Let me tell you where I'm heading up to Ocean City, Maryland.

[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:13.660]
All right.

[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.620]
How depressing.

[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:16.600]
Martin.

[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:17.760]
What are you going to do up there?

[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:20.840]
Well, I'm going to go up there and get my apartment for the summer.

[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.240]
I live up there all summer long.

[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:23.320]
Well, I don't blame you, sir.

[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.560]
I'll say it's fantastic.

[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:28.580]
But what am I going to do for the next week and a half without you?

[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.340]
I mean, I don't know how to survive.

[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.780]
Well, what, you're on I-95?

[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:33.260]
Yeah.

[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:34.320]
I'll catch you up to you.

[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:35.240]
Give me some suggestions.

[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:36.540]
Just put on your headlights.

[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:37.460]
I'll catch you up to you.

[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:38.020]
Okay.

[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:40.280]
Hey, can you do me a favor?

[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:40.660]
Yeah.

[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:45.720]
Look at that Santa Claus Elvis thing about heating all the time.

[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:46.920]
Oh, man.

[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.100]
I know it's that the thing.

[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.200]
Oh, man.

[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:53.460]
I mean, I just played Gary Hart, which is a little outdata, but it still has a message.

[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.860]
Elvis Claus, you mean?

[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.160]
Oh, and it's what?

[01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:57.660]
Are you there?

[01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.860]
Boy, he's got the crampiest mobile phone.

[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:01.500]
Well, sir.

[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:04.060]
Oh, like here.

[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.300]
Like very much.

[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.900]
As there is the king.

[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:10.640]
I don't have him in around much.

[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:11.140]
For a while.

[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.100]
But I want y'all to know what up here in Rock and Roll Heaven.

[01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:15.720]
I'll do a thinking of you.

[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:16.400]
But it's Christmas.

[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:20.740]
And I have to give y'all a special Christmas message.

[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.460]
A message of peace.

[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.480]
Like, how about a little piece of that pie going by?

[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:27.140]
Thank you.

[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:27.660]
I got it right.

[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:30.420]
A block of a slam.

[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.860]
Christmas is a time of hoot.

[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:34.060]
A time of joy.

[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:35.420]
A time of eleven.

[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:37.340]
And I sure would love him.

[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:37.940]
Take slides.

[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:38.940]
That feature you got there.

[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:40.200]
Like it.

[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:40.900]
Oh, we're lost.

[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:42.020]
No, we're lost.

[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:43.320]
Oh, yeah, Christmas.

[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:46.400]
Christmas to me means family.

[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.220]
Family means friends.

[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.300]
The friends means getting together.

[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:53.200]
And getting together means eating.

[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:55.080]
I'll pass me that drum to take.

[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:55.440]
Which please?

[01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:56.420]
I'll flake you.

[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:56.980]
I'll give you one more.

[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:00.440]
Now, just a little slater here right now.

[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:02.700]
You know, I'm maybe a big star.

[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:03.600]
Maybe too big.

[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:05.380]
But ain't nobody so big.

[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:06.780]
You can't reach out a helping hand.

[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:08.780]
A helping hand.

[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:13.000]
Would you hand me a helping of those mashed potatoes over there?

[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:13.560]
Which I believe?

[01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:14.280]
Like it.

[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:14.840]
Like it.

[01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:14.860]

[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:17.820]
Like I was trying to.

[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.060]
Ain't nobody so big.

[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:21.920]
You can't stoop to help a friend of neat over the holiday season.

[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:26.140]
Speaking of season, you won't pass me that self-sugger when you get the chance.

[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:26.620]
Like it.

[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:27.120]
Yeah.

[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.520]
Just don't screw the cover.

[01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:28.880]
That's right.

[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:29.280]
Like it.

[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:29.820]
I got one more.

[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:34.000]
So this Christmas, why don't y'all take a tip from old A.O.

[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:37.300]
No, no, leave those stick tips right where they are.

[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:37.820]
You know what I mean?

[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:38.620]
No, I appreciate it.

[01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:42.720]
I want you to remember, we're all part of God's great big family.

[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:45.460]
You know God made man into his own image.

[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:46.920]
And look at the mirror.

[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:50.360]
I'd have to say God must be a big, big son of a gun.

[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:50.920]
You know what I mean?

[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:52.180]
I like you dear.

[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.220]
But I especially want y'all to remember this one last thing.

[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:59.820]
When y'all is homeless Christmas, springing that popcorn up on the tree.

[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.000]
Save a big, big bowl for the can.

[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:04.940]
Next to butter, no more money.

[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:05.960]
I like you dear.

[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:06.800]
I like you.

[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:07.440]
I like you.

[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:07.940]
I like you.

[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.760]
Okay, have a safe trip, sir.

[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:14.200]
And as we go up to the top of the hour, ladies and gentlemen, in the noon W.I.O.

[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:14.640]
I stayed here.

[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:15.920]
I'm going 40 years ago.

[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:19.100]
And butter wasn't even to stay back to the night and forty at night, baby.

[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:20.480]
Here's Doris.

[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:22.120]
I walked down the sea.

[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.860]
I was supposed to shoot.

[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:26.040]
He followed me down the sea.

[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.240]
He called me Doris.

[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:30.840]
He called me wherever.

[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:31.480]
Oh!

[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:35.720]
So it's the man, but now you want the soul of kids for me.

[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:36.720]
I'll bet Doris.

[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.060]
Anyway, that's going to do it for this hour.

[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.040]
Deborah Martinez is standing by with the illuminating and ever constipating noon W.I.O.

[01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:44.460]
D. News.

[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:48.440]
We're going to come back at 1205 and continue probably some more of the great highlights.

[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:52.580]
The hits of all time from Ron, say John, on your music way, A1A.

[01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:55.480]
And Alex Bennett, you're a two-film critic, Mike Snyder.

[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.560]
And the Sean O'Connor and the local likes for St. Patrick's Day, Comic Kevin Meany.

[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:05.820]
Nuclear Valdez, lots more guest sports talk at 605 and the Stan Major Show from 8 to 11

[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:06.200]
the night.
