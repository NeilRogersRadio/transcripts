424 W-I-O-D and Broard.

[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:00.640]

[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:10.220]
424 W-I-O-D and Broard.

[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.640]
Hello Canada and Hockey fans of the United States and Japan Land.

[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.420]
And I'd like to make hello to Canadian servicemen overseas.

[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.940]
This is the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.700]
This is your brain.

[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.620]
Any questions?

[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.900]
OK, that's you get all the Canadians in the patriotic spirit that it takes to get them on the bus and go back.

[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.580]
Do you notice that they never rent any cars?

[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.640]
They're too cheap to rent a car.

[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.400]
They drive all the way down here from Quebec, which is a long slip.

[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:46.320]
And you see all these other rental cars from Alamo and this one and Moishi Slipper Render Car Company.

[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.580]
But not the French Canadians man, all these Quebec plates and boy are they doing it.

[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.240]
Hope you had a good weekend, especially on I-95 it was sensational.

[00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.120]
And we had the art festival and the art show and the boat show and everything all in one weekend.

[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.220]
It's like the big two, three weeks out of the year we're really doing it.

[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.340]
And that's it.

[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.020]
And isn't it great?

[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.720]
We got good morning America from ABC here, painting a blue sky.

[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.360]
I wonder if they're going to have Bruce Singer on over there to do blue skies for America.

[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.120]
Tell them how wonderful everything is here.

[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.060]
And the occupancy rate in the hotels is tremendous.

[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.780]
I'm reading in the sunset in the morning.

[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.100]
They chased all the kids away.

[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.380]
And they've got all these Europeans there.

[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.920]
Of course the European currency starts devaluing.

[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.940]
We're going to be in big trouble, but it's good.

[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.180]
Blue sky, everything is fabulous.

[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.960]
We take two, three weeks, a wanes on the line.

[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.220]
We want so much food so soon.

[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.020]
Tell them, tell them, don't worry about the the trimmings and about a lot of fall to all.

[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.920]
And just a whole bunch like immediately.

[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.800]
We don't want to be pushy.

[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.440]
But boy, am I ready?

[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.780]
Because I know it's going to be a grim day.

[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.280]
It's a holiday.

[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.260]
It's president's day.

[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.600]
We're honoring two of America's great presidents today.

[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.200]
Ulysses S. Grant and Warren Harding.

[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.220]
And this is the big day.

[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.660]
It used to be a Lincoln's birthday, Washington's birthday.

[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.060]
But now everything has to be simplified.

[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.560]
Okay, we don't want to get too complicated because most Americans don't even know who the hell it is.

[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.580]
Anyway, what am I doing?

[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.940]
A nightclub routine this morning?

[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.320]
Boy, I feel full of energy here.

[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.380]
I may break out in the song and he's second here.

[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.520]
I feel a song coming on.

[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.000]
Anyway, it's a 10.09.

[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:21.760]
I don't have a sheet.

[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.100]
Is there anybody working today?

[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.840]
Or is this seven?

[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.900]
I think Channel seven must be celebrating the holiday today because the parking lot look pretty empty.

[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.280]
Pretty empty.

[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.400]
We do have a sheet in there.

[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.640]
Okay, let's see which amateur comedians are coming on at two o'clock today.

[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.080]
Let's take a look and see the names.

[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.920]
The Johnny Walker National Comedy Surge with Bud Friedman.

[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.060]
Comes to the Alex, Alex Bench.

[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:52.160]
You'll also comedian Anna Collins, whose brother Tom will be in the studio audience supplying the applause.

[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.740]
Coming this week, stripper week, the insightful looking at the attack on our local Newty bars.

[00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:01.640]
And some very well-endowed ladies will be in the building to try to entice some of the horniest guys in the world.

[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.200]
I notice it's basically the same schleppers keep coming in to suck up the free food.

[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.340]
You notice that one old short guy that keeps coming in here for the food.

[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.740]
Don't you people have any shame at all?

[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.080]
My God, it's embarrassing.

[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.100]
Also, it was a great weekend.

[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.080]
Bill and I had a tremendous day out of Gulfstream on Saturday.

[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.240]
Lost our brains.

[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.240]
I had a plunge like you wouldn't believe.

[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.480]
I could have gone to the roof and jumped all at just drowning in a sea of chalk at Gulfstream.

[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.740]
All these three to five shots.

[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.080]
Every race was another three to five, one to two.

[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.760]
And they all won like champions.

[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.200]
I don't want to have a day like that.

[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:38.240]
It's bad news and you'll never guess who showed up at Gulfstream and plopped himself down right by.

[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.080]
I thought he was just going to come by to say hi, but no such luck.

[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.460]
Fat Rich showed up.

[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.340]
I'm going to tell you something.

[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.540]
He's a nice guy and all of that.

[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.880]
But one day I'm going to be in my house and I'm going to go get up, go into the bathroom and open the door.

[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.900]
And he's going to be in there.

[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.780]
I'm telling you, I just know it's a matter of time.

[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.360]
It's like the shadow.

[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.620]
He's like Lamont Cranston.

[00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.400]
He's everywhere.

[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.740]
Rich, you're a wonderful guy.

[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:01.620]
But go find a life.

[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.140]
Go find some new toys to play with and leave me alone.

[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:04.800]
Okay, William.

[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.940]
He also never cashed a ticket, which made me very happy.

[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.380]
It did.

[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.100]
It made me real happy because Missouri loves company.

[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.660]
And we got some calls there on the board early, which is a great sign.

[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.260]
And we'll get to them when we're good and ready.

[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.960]
In the meantime, we're going to do a little spot here.

[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.680]
751 WIOD and Dade.

[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.020]
524 WIOD and Broward.

[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.800]
278 9463 and Boken Del Rey.

[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.420]
And 655 WIOD.

[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.560]
Those are the numbers we got.

[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.420]
Hurricanes, by the way, congratulations to Ron Fraser and the Hurricanes baseball team,

[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.400]
sweeping Texas, who supposedly were the number one team in the country.

[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.560]
But I saw some of that game yesterday on ESP.

[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.060]
No, on sports channel.

[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.300]
Oh, well, I almost made a bad mistake on sports channel.

[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.940]
And I will not say anything to sports channel.

[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.620]
We love them and they're a wonderful sponsor.

[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.080]
I won't say anything about Frank Messer because that would be wrong.

[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.860]
Anyway, we want to tell you about the incredible $89 special ed Nutri system.

[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.360]
It continues this week.

[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.080]
Frank Wayne Arnold, who will be here any minute now, any second,

[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:05.000]
with loads of great food from Arnold's Royal Castle with nearly burgers and all kinds of Hazarai.

[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.060]
Wayne has lost 99 pounds on Nutri system.

[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.480]
In fact, as we speak right now, I wouldn't be surprised if he's just edged over the hundred mark.

[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.780]
And 17 inches off that formerly grotesque, enormous waste.

[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.000]
I mean, he really looks like a different person and you can do it too.

[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.940]
Lose all the way you can for just $89 whether it's 25, 50, 75, all you can for just 89 bucks.

[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.600]
And there are Nutri system locations all over Dave Broward in Palm Beach.

[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.440]
If you'd like to locate the one closest, most convenient to you, call 1-800-344-Thin.

[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.820]
1-800-344-Thin and there is some more good news.

[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:46.260]
A brand new Nutri system weight-loss center opening this week at 565 West 49th Street in prestigious, Halea.

[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:52.600]
1-800-344-Thin. You call them right now and tell them that Neil Rogers from WIOD told you to call Nutri system.

[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.080]
Okay, I got a real good idea for the people down in traffic.

[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.700]
When you're logging spots, it's always good to like if you got about four or five car dealers in the same hour.

[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.420]
Lock them all together, you know, like back to back.

[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:13.040]
Because people, once you do the first one, people are like thinking about, hey, I'm going to go out and buy a new car.

[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.300]
What the hell are they doing downstairs anyway? Are they nuts?

[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:21.900]
We got some special food. We're going to doctor Wayne when you come in doctors, some of that food for the people in traffic today.

[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.880]
They are in nuts downstairs, 1015 at WIOD. Let's take our first call of the morning.

[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.100]
It ought to be a really tremendous call. By the way, it's kids are all out of school today, right?

[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.040]
And some people, I know there can't be too many people not working.

[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.800]
There was a pretty good amount of traffic today, not heavy duty, but not too bad. Davey.

[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:39.680]
Morning, Neil.

[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.940]
Yeah. Yeah. Did the chief skate by his own program this time?

[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.240]
He did not have a racing form. Is that right?

[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:52.600]
And I'm trying to think I don't even know if he had a program. I'm trying to think.

[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.160]
As a matter of fact, I don't think so because when he came rushing in about the fourth or fifth race,

[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:03.340]
and he looked at the board and he boxed the three favorites in the perfect and lost, of course.

[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.780]
But no, he, I know he didn't buy a form. That's for sure.

[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.900]
And that incredible. I got a call the spy report. You're probably going to get a couple calls on this.

[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:18.760]
Yes. Bill had told most of his callers to call you and ask you about your par in the last race.

[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.660]
I think that's the name of the horse. What about it?

[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.120]
I don't know. He just said, I don't know. You must have lost on it or something.

[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.100]
Still coming in. He's still running right now. Boy, they bet that horse down like he was a champion.

[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.320]
And I had one chance to get even for the day. I really blew it. It was in a tenth race.

[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:40.100]
Mike Gonzalez in the feature had Princess Mora and with 111 pounds was in with a feather and paid $17.

[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:46.560]
And I almost bet it. And then I wound up betting that damn three horse with the Richard Mellory who I see had like two or three winners yesterday.

[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.920]
But up until yesterday, he's been riding like a beginner. He's a really good jockey from New York.

[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:56.600]
And he's been down here doing nothing. And he rode that three horse in the feature like a amateur on Saturday.

[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.520]
It was embarrassing. Got trapped on a rail behind a dead horse.

[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.380]
But that's that's a way it goes. That's the first race. Bill said he had Gonzalez, but he didn't have the second horse.

[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.040]
Now, while the two that 12 horse in the last race was 25 to one, nobody had it.

[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.780]
Hey, Neil, I got a friend at work, right? His name is Mike.

[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:17.120]
He used to call him big Mike and he was on a newt your system. He's lost over 80 pounds.

[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.440]
Great. Well, he's not big Mike anymore. Now I call him beanpole.

[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.920]
There you go. And he's looking real good. Just keep it up, Mike. I know he's listening.

[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.760]
Keep it up, Mike. So to speak. Okay. Have a great day. Okay.

[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.960]
Boy, Colters really rubbing it in. Hi. I didn't see you cash.

[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.140]
Many tickets on Saturday. Bill didn't see a cash ticket.

[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:41.140]
I had the first half of the double. And that was it. Did not cash the double.

[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.640]
Did not cash all day. Nothing. I just kept chasing and chasing was one of those awful days.

[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.960]
You know, but I don't want to I don't want to dwell on it. Okay.

[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.620]
And that counterfeit six horse in the last race with Gonzalez. Mike, you're a wonderful guy.

[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.900]
I'm glad you weren't hurt the other day. It's wonderful to see a winning.

[00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.440]
But that horse man, what a piece of garbage. Anyway, we have an opening in the Bokeh and Delray.

[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.600]
Well, listen, we got six calls on there. What the hell am I giving numbers out? Right?

[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.760]
Oh, here's somebody who went to the track. Yeah, I knew it wasn't a beautiful day out there.

[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.980]
Yeah, it was just like heaven until they started running. Yeah.

[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.280]
Yeah, we got there early and we had sat there on the rooftop restaurant.

[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:22.280]
But I got we got killed. Oh, see of chalk all that heavy duty chalk all those, you know,

[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:25.740]
and then I got sucked into that four horse in a second race with Jerry Bailey.

[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:31.480]
He had a horse a week or two ago. That was also a real expensive Mr. Prospector first time starter

[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.920]
and one like a champion. And so I got sucked in on that four horse in the second race.

[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.520]
And he got left in the gate. See, when you got those first time starters, boy, it's tough.

[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.620]
You know, like Castillo won the first race with the first time we're on Saturday.

[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:48.260]
But I'll tell you more often than not forget those horses. You know, they bet them down and they get left in the gate.

[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.800]
They're green. They're inexperienced. They don't know what they're doing.

[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:56.500]
Well, not exactly what we were thinking because those first few races there, just, you know, here they were first time starters.

[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.660]
But I tell you, the green sheet had a mom off everyone in those first few races.

[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.640]
Yeah. Well, that's because all that chalk came in. But the green sheet does a really, really do. They do a good job.

[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:10.520]
But we got killed in a fifth on that no program, taking bills, big advice, you know.

[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.560]
Well, even in second, it was pretty close. Yeah, but we were the three horse with McCauley that won that race.

[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.400]
You couldn't bet that horse with Chinese money.

[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.840]
Right. I know. And I think I cast one time all day.

[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.660]
Well, that's one more than we did combine. So that's not too bad.

[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:30.260]
Well, listen, it's not important that you cash, but then you have a good time and you make a nice contribution and you plunge your brains out.

[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.440]
We had Foxy reality. Oh, did you? Well, that's good for about what? 560?

[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.900]
560. That was only really low. 12 dollars.

[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.760]
Yeah, I didn't like that horse at all. But I don't want to go through this because nobody cares about it. They're not into this.

[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.000]
You know the one thing. You rather talk about the art festival and the grove.

[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.960]
I went to Highlya, you know, when you tried to take them to Highlya. And Highlya really has a lot of aesthetic beauty.

[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.000]
But boy, it was just gorgeous out there. Yeah. I have people in from Idaho.

[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.280]
Well, I would say Gulf Streams are close second. It's a beautiful place. It was really nice.

[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.580]
Have you eaten that restaurant downstairs? It's right below the rooftop?

[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.260]
Yeah, I don't know because we never pay.

[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.480]
Oh, not we don't have been there in a long time. And so we don't go there to free load.

[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.400]
Okay. In fact, if it weren't for Fred the Usher, we'd have nowhere to sit.

[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.320]
But the restaurant's pretty good down there too, right? Yeah.

[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.660]
Because we were on the rooftop and it was real nice. But I saw it downstairs.

[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.220]
I went in the cafeteria before I got there real early because Bill had that remote.

[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.380]
So he didn't get there at about a quarter to one. So I went there first.

[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:35.440]
I went into cafeteria. I had some of that chowder and a cheeseburger and a piece of key lime pie.

[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.340]
And that set me up for I was growing good shape for the rest of the day.

[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.140]
Oh, the only a one. Nice. Long.

[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.240]
Hang Goldberg's fire report. You know, he's really not your friend.

[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.220]
He had a good shot where he could have stroked to the other day.

[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:52.920]
And he didn't on the hockey deal. He was bragging about how some guy in Miami there talked about hockey.

[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.360]
He got a whole four hour show about it. Never mentioned your name. Never mentioned the station.

[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:04.260]
But where was this? This was when he was doing one of his big set here at the Super Bowl.

[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.820]
When he was, you know, talking all the big.

[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:12.220]
At the Super Bowl. Not the Super Bowl. What was it? The, uh, Super Bowl.

[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.300]
Toilet Bowl. That was it. I don't know what you're talking about.

[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.060]
It was one. He was talking with a bunch of the press people and they were talking about sports in Miami.

[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.720]
And how that hockey would come down here. And then he mentioned it.

[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.940]
About how that some guy on the radio didn't mention.

[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.080]
But what was it on though? Where was he?

[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.260]
He was on his first sports talk. Oh, well, who cares?

[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.940]
But he had some big weight from one of the, uh, from one of the.

[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.980]
Don't worry about it. Don't lose any sleep over it.

[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.100]
Okay. Could have given you a nice.

[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.960]
But what, what difference would it make? What, what would it change?

[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:46.500]
Would it change anything? He, he, he was so proud that someone was talking hockey and how big hockey was.

[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.460]
But he didn't mention. Well, listen, Hank's okay. He never stole a freight train. Okay.

[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.320]
And that's right. Well, we'll see on their Saturday.

[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.620]
Okay. Good luck to you. You'll need it. 21 past 10 at W I O D.

[00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.520]
What was that all about? I haven't got any idea. Did anybody see Ann Bishop this morning?

[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.300]
I'm good morning, America. I did not see it, of course.

[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.160]
But I heard through the through the ratevine that Ann was on there.

[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.780]
I guess they're trying to butcher up the image of South Florida a little bit.

[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.700]
I heard that they're going to have a new name for the late addition to the news on Channel 10 when Ann is on.

[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.620]
It's the bulldog edition of the Channel 10 news. That would be disgusting.

[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:22.340]
Wouldn't that? But very accurate. Anyway, that guy is still doing news on four.

[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.640]
I can't believe how bad they've gotten. They are so they're embarrassing.

[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:30.460]
They're just a disgrace on Channel four. They are floundering.

[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.960]
Floundering. Dick Lobo. Are you listening to me? You're floundering. It's embarrassed.

[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.180]
It's humiliating. Maybe they'll really do this.

[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.820]
I'm just smart thing and pick up that guy. It does the sports from six Dan Ford. He's my favorite.

[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.840]
751 W.I.O.D. and Dave. We have an opening there and Palm Beach is wide open.

[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.320]
You can drive a fleet of Mac trucks right through the middle of it at 655 NERD.

[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.960]
655 W.I.O.D. and we'll come right back.

[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:04.720]
Hi, this Stan Major joined me tonight after Hurricane Pasca ball at about 930 or so up until 11 o'clock for the major addition.

[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.280]
I do stock radio 610 W.I.O.D.

[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.760]
610 W.I.O.D.

[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.020]
No, 24 past 10 at W.I.O.D.

[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:21.580]
Big thing on Rick Sutcliffe here on ESPN. We got it on in here now to warm it up for the exercise shows a little later.

[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:26.880]
And there's a big thing on Rick Sutcliffe on here now. And evidently he's into quarter horses and he got his daughter on there.

[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.560]
And it's about as exciting as death.

[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:34.800]
Anyway, it's 1025. What was that other thing? I was going to, oh, I wanted to correct myself. I said, Dan Ford.

[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.920]
Who the hell is Dan Ford besides a baseball player? Dan Cogland as in Father Cogland.

[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.940]
Speaking of Father Cogland, did anybody watch the Kennedy thing last night and they be seeing the mini series?

[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.560]
I don't know. I guess it was fairly interesting, but boy, they sure made him out to be a wonderful guy in the beginning.

[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.560]
Wasn't he? How did he suddenly change so dramatically? I don't buy that. Oh, he was just...

[00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:02.860]
Mr. Wonderful and his great boy, those Catholics can sure pump out the babies. Can't they? Man, they knock him out like...

[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.520]
I think about every three months, don't they?

[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:16.680]
About three times as fast as everybody else. They just knock him out like crazy. But anyway, he was just a wonderful loving father and a great husband that all of a sudden, man, he met Gloria Swanson or something happened.

[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:27.540]
I don't know what it was. And he turned out to be the ruthless crooked son of an anti-Semite, whatever he was. He really was. He was a bad dude, Joe Kennedy.

[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:35.960]
He was a bad, bad dude, okay? Just... Just... When is the rest of it on? Does anybody know? Is it on tonight? Probably on the Maronite. That's the way they generally do it.

[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.420]
A snooze spy report from Kendall.

[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.060]
Absolutely. Good morning, Neil.

[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:40.740]
Absolutely.

[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:49.760]
From hot from the Alice Rantel show this morning. Yes. One of the first big changes you were talking about last week.

[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.940]
The... By the way, I want you to know, sir, these changes are absolutely final.

[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.240]
Okay.

[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:59.160]
Never did change again. That's what John Harper is going to say. These changes are final.

[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.660]
You were speaking of dead horses earlier, so I thought I'd come in with this WS News spy report.

[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.700]
Sports talk. Junior, junior is starting over there.

[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.640]
I forget whether it's this week or next week.

[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.540]
At 6.30.

[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.260]
At 6.30.

[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.680]
Well, didn't... Wasn't I the first one to have that on the air, sir?

[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.560]
Oh, I must have missed it.

[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.320]
Oh, yes. On Friday with Alombardo, 6.30 to 8.

[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.240]
I thought it was Guy.

[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.760]
No, he's on Tuesday Wednesday and Saturday.

[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.500]
Oh, okay.

[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.520]
That's just what we need was another sports talk show, right?

[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:30.420]
Oh, man. This market is embarrassing. It is just listen to the music on the FM stations. Over the weekend.

[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.040]
Every time I'd get in a car and I'd be desperate to hear a little bit of something that I wanted to hear again.

[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:41.000]
Forget it. Just hopeless. You can keep punching around. You can have every FM in the market on your FM buttons, you know?

[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.820]
And it's hopeless. There's nothing to listen to.

[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.040]
Well, you have a good president's day.

[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:47.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.860]
To an honor of President Hubert Heaver.

[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:51.940]
Thank you very much.

[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.820]
Oh, can I call two of my friends D-bags?

[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:56.880]
Who's that, sir?

[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.920]
Gary and Carolyn, you're both douchebags.

[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.000]
Okay. Wonderful call. You got it all in there, sir.

[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.240]
28 after 10 at WIOD. Two open lines are both in date coincidentally enough.

[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.660]
And probably most of the people in dates still lost at the art festival in the grow in the grow.

[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.000]
It was so exciting. 751 WIOD.

[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.280]
Look, I realized we had a lot of exciting things going on.

[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.120]
They had a million people or something there and all that.

[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.280]
But don't you understand how you're being jobbed in this town?

[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.580]
Don't you realize what a what a farce this all is?

[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.760]
It's like two, three weeks out of the year and all this big stuff goes out.

[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.120]
We got the grand prix on Sunday.

[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:32.200]
And then all of a sudden it gets to be the end of March or after Easter time.

[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.840]
And it's like, hey, where did everybody wait a minute?

[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:34.680]
Where they all go?

[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.400]
What's going? There's nothing going on here.

[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.460]
And it used to be made for a few years thereafter.

[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.420]
Thanksgiving would start a little bit now.

[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.220]
It's like after Christmas and usually after the middle of January.

[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.980]
And it's brutal. It really is.

[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.580]
I mean, this town is so far short of what it could be.

[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.380]
And all they keep doing is writing all this pilot.

[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.460]
You are such a bunch of parochial Yahoo Hicks.

[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.480]
All you politicians and all you media people in this town.

[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.840]
You don't know what a real tourist town is all about.

[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:01.660]
Or you know nothing.

[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.460]
Here it is. It's almost the year 2000.

[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.560]
And we've got the season.

[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.660]
The season is here for a couple of weeks.

[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.360]
And we got all these big things going on.

[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.780]
And then it goes back to being like death Valley days.

[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.320]
You couldn't find a living in because all the old farts now have completely taken the town over.

[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.560]
You see that thing now for Lauderdale is actively campaigning.

[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.780]
They're sending letters to all the college campuses urging them to stay the hell out of here.

[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.780]
Don't come here. Go someplace else.

[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:28.940]
Unless you have a walker.

[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.520]
If you have a walker, you can come down.

[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:30.880]
Okay.

[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.580]
Fort Lauderdale.

[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.320]
Yeah. I like to talk about the exciting things happening up here at the Los Olas Art Festival.

[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.600]
I like the timing of that, too.

[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.660]
The same weekend as the Grove. That was very good.

[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:47.140]
Yeah. Well, at the Poets Restaurant, Debbie Ellis was putting on a eating exhibition.

[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.340]
And Dan Quill found a very entertaining.

[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.120]
But the Secret Service did not.

[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.860]
And they promptly arrested her because they thought that his life was in danger.

[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.280]
He could have been next.

[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:06.080]
Well, you know, Nick DeVarro had some pointers on how to house Debbie Ellis.

[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.800]
He's advising him not to use the tent because he got into trouble when he used the tent.

[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:14.340]
Hello.

[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:14.800]
Yeah.

[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:15.800]
Oh, I thought I got calm.

[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.940]
Still here. Isn't that amazing?

[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:17.380]
Yeah.

[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:18.220]
Yeah. I'm still here.

[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.760]
I'm just waiting to see, you know.

[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.660]
Where's the punchline?

[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.280]
I'm just waiting to see what'll happen.

[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.760]
How long it'll take before you just fall down on the floor, you know.

[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:31.240]
Well, you know, Gary Bruce has asked a comment on what he thought of Debbie Ellis being arrested at Poets Restaurant.

[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.020]
And he said it was poetic justice.

[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.180]
Not bad.

[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:34.860]
Okay.

[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:35.320]
Not bad.

[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:35.660]
I'm out of it.

[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.720]
Okay. Well, you saved me.

[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.900]
I've not had a tear before I called, but I've never heard of it.

[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.640]
Well, that was redeeming that last part.

[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:40.800]
Okay. Have a great life, sir.

[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.020]
Everybody's a comedian.

[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.040]
And of course, they all wind up on the Alex Benichot.

[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.760]
1030 at WIOD.

[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.160]
One opening and David, one in Brown.

[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.380]
We're going to keep those lines really sizzling on a Monday.

[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:52.420]
I'm telling you, I know you don't believe me, but you you mark my words.

[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.500]
Of course, this call from Boko is going to be very short, isn't it?

[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.300]
Oh, did he get disconnected?

[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.000]
What a bad break.

[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.460]
Oh, there is a God after all, isn't there?

[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.340]
There really is.

[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.220]
Boy, that's incredible.

[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.640]
Let's see, we did Fort Lauderdale.

[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.180]
Homestead is right here.

[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:08.520]
Hello.

[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:11.180]
Homestead?

[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.380]
Oh, do you think it's a plan.

[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:15.980]
Plantation.

[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.160]
Oh, hi, Neil.

[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:17.540]
Yeah.

[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.320]
What is your question?

[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.400]
What is your question?

[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:18.440]

[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.100]
Saturday night.

[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.300]
The movie was that for the bowling scene for the hardcore celebration.

[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.740]
What are you talking about?

[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:24.200]
What the hell?

[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.440]
Steve Kane was the expert.

[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:26.520]
On what?

[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.320]
On the movie.

[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.260]
What about it?

[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:30.860]
Oh, come on.

[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.660]
Did I miss something, and what you just said?

[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.260]
Oh, I don't think so.

[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.000]
You're pretty good, though.

[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:36.480]
Yeah.

[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.400]
What is he talking about?

[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.060]
Does anybody have any idea?

[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:43.940]
Uh, Broward.

[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:44.200]
Hello.

[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:44.980]
Hello.

[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:45.600]
Yeah.

[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.380]
Yeah, I got a Bob Lassipist by report.

[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.600]
I was in Chicago listening to him, and he was doing a program on drunk driving.

[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:55.200]
His idea was that if you fail to breathalyze a test, you go straight to jail.

[00:28:55.420 --> 00:29:00.320]
So this, Gal calls up, and she says, well, I'd rather drive drunk than walk drunk,

[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.740]
because if I'm walking drunk, there's a chance I could hit by a car.

[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:10.480]
And he says, you know, all my life I wanted to go to a big market because the callers would be intelligent.

[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.680]
And I got a big kick out of that.

[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.580]
I guess you didn't get a kick out of it.

[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:18.320]
Hmm.

[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.080]
Boy, did I come in like in a dream world this morning?

[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.760]
I must be really just fantasizing, huh?

[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.880]
It's back to Monday again, okay?

[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:28.820]
Forget about the holiday.

[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.520]
Forget about President Truman, okay?

[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.420]
It's just back to Monday, big time.

[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:33.340]
Okay.

[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.440]
Well, from the channel, Tim, I wouldn't have seen you.

[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.820]
I guess that the Q and A.

[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.100]
Hey, where's that going?

[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.380]
What, what's you doing with that?

[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.020]
My shame, guys.

[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:41.840]
Oh, my God.

[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.380]
Quick, quick, quick, stay with the wife.

[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:49.140]
She was fed up with reading one story after another about drugs and violence.

[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:55.760]
Now, she wants to write the rules and rewrite the news in...

[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:56.820]
...and...

[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.660]
...whole...

[00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.540]
...starring and vicious.

[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.320]
Don't kill me, please.

[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.020]
I'll see you tonight at 5.611.

[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:04.840]
Gal.

[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.880]
...and whole...

[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.360]
...and...

[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.400]
What are you going to do with me?

[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:17.060]
When I get through with you, there won't be enough of you left to make a good, true pay for Don No.

[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:18.860]
And...

[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:19.620]
...whole...

[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.400]
...starring and vicious.

[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.900]
Also, starring Carl Weathers is to wipe blood or nails.

[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.920]
And Don No, says Don No.

[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.620]
And I shall marry Ronald, but where?

[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.460]
And Bo, she re-roams the news.

[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.000]
And Bo, coming soon.

[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.700]
I'll bet. 1033 at WID.

[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.420]
We hit a brick wall.

[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.300]
There was every line lit and then I went to that line 7.

[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:46.580]
And it was gone.

[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.660]
And since that moment, it's like death-fally days on that phone.

[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:51.620]
Well, you people are brutal.

[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:52.960]
You really are. It's just incredible.

[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.580]
And you notice all the response about that Kennedy thing on ABC last night?

[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.100]
They don't even know what the hell I'm talking about.

[00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:58.940]
WIOD.

[00:30:59.260 --> 00:30:59.820]
Good morning.

[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:00.380]
Yeah.

[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:02.660]
Yes.

[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.300]
What is it?

[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:07.540]
Yeah, okay.

[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.300]
Guys, trying to have a moving experience.

[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.760]
Do you hear these voices?

[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.800]
Boy, they all really sound the same, don't they?

[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.400]
All right, let's go to a J&O spy report on the Palm Beach Line.

[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:17.700]
Hello.

[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.260]
Big D here.

[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:19.820]
Yeah.

[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:26.120]
Mike Miller and Lee Fowler, I just intercepted an internal memorandum to John Becono, the station manager.

[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.200]
Your name came up.

[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.120]
They called you a douchebag.

[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.580]
But more importantly, in a later memo.

[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.020]
Sir, let me say this to you.

[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.180]
For the benefit of the listening audience, have a wonderful day.

[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:39.480]
Okay.

[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:43.420]
All the amateur comedians this morning, they must be a lot of people off from work today.

[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:44.780]
Wow.

[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.340]
That starts at two o'clock.

[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:46.760]
Okay.

[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.820]
The amateur comedy hour.

[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.260]
Don't call in here and try to be funny and make jokes.

[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.140]
You're pathetic this morning.

[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.060]
It's embarrassing.

[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:59.160]
It's degrading and humiliating and disgusting and revolting and nauseating and unbelievable.

[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.240]
Although it's not too bad.

[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:02.700]
1034 WIOD.

[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.440]
Let's try one.

[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.840]
Is there anything here that's worth going to?

[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:06.660]
Gilbert Report?

[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.460]
No, I'm going to go to this one in North Miami.

[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:08.920]
Hello.

[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:09.600]

[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.180]
Hi.

[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:10.800]
How are you?

[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:11.560]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.440]
Oh, boy.

[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.340]
I don't know.

[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.540]
I don't know neither.

[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.060]
Are they funny today, huh?

[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.340]
I was over at Edmackwood of Gong.

[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.820]
Every one of these callers off in the first two seconds.

[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.440]
I saw the nurture system show.

[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.620]
And I understand Alex didn't even show up.

[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.080]
Is that true?

[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.720]
I don't have any idea.

[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.000]
What is this another crank call?

[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.180]
No, honestly, I was there.

[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.220]
And I asked him.

[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.100]
Well, if you were there, what do you mean you understand he didn't show up?

[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:42.220]
Well, I don't know who he is and I asked to come to the guys and they said they didn't even know who he was.

[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.120]
I was over there, Neil.

[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:44.760]
Uh-huh.

[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.700]
And I saw Steve.

[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.120]
Oh, isn't that exciting?

[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.040]
Steve looks awful.

[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:50.840]
Uh-huh.

[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.040]
Yeah, he looks about 80.

[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.260]
Oh, my God, he has no ass.

[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.620]
And I'm telling you.

[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.960]
I'm not talking about his ass.

[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.540]
I don't care about his ass.

[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.100]
He really has none.

[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.140]
And he looked terrible.

[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.180]
Well, is that how you judge how somebody looks is if they have an answer now?

[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.300]
Boy, I'll tell you that guy.

[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:11.280]
Who's that guy, um, the actor who was on a Kennedy thing last night?

[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:11.720]
I don't know.

[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:12.400]
I didn't watch that.

[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.620]
Oh, gee.

[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:14.340]
What is his name?

[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:15.060]
Charles Durning.

[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:15.900]
Oh, oh.

[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:16.660]
He looks great.

[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:17.280]
You know why?

[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.560]
He's got an ass like the side, the state of Montana.

[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.320]
That's right.

[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.540]
So that's the barometer, man.

[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.460]
He looks fabulous.

[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.840]
I should have watched it.

[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.040]
I watched it tonight, then.

[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.580]
No, I should watch it.

[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.020]
God.

[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.160]
What happened to these people over the weekend?

[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:29.820]
I don't know.

[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.700]
But Steve really looked here.

[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.800]
I thought you might like to know.

[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.660]
Well, no, I don't wish that he looks terrible.

[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:36.160]
He looked terrible when he left here.

[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.500]
He was aging rapidly.

[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:38.060]
I know.

[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:38.440]
Let's see.

[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.460]
I haven't seen him.

[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:39.800]
Really.

[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.880]
I don't think I've seen him in person two or three times.

[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.180]
Well, you're lucky.

[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:45.000]
I know.

[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.040]
But anyway, the show is great.

[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:52.540]
And I'll tell you, some of the women, the towns that they lost over there was absolutely

[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:53.100]
fantastic.

[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:54.820]
I don't need it.

[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.340]
I'm just saying it's not worth it.

[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:56.500]
Okay.

[00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.480]
Well, part two of the Kennedy thing on ABC is tonight at 9 p.m.

[00:33:59.620 --> 00:33:59.940]
Okay.

[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:00.540]
I'll watch.

[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:01.020]
I'll watch.

[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:01.460]
I'll watch during.

[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:02.060]
And you'll love.

[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.060]
Well, I don't know if he's going to be alive too much longer.

[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.840]
He plays a John Fitzgerald.

[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:07.480]
Oh, he does.

[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.000]
He played Joe Kennedy's father in law.

[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:09.880]
Oh, oh, oh.

[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:10.160]
Okay.

[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.200]
Well, I watch it now.

[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:11.800]
I'll take a good look.

[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.200]
And if that's what makes you happy, boy, you'll be delirious.

[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:14.440]
All right.

[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.160]
I'll take a good look.

[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:15.480]
Okay.

[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.100]
Yeah.

[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:20.920]
He's got an A, the size of even bigger than Al Goldstein, which is almost impossible.

[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.220]
We have an open line in date, 751 W.I.

[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.020]
Did the audience is incorrigible today.

[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:29.280]
These people just, even she was crazier than a bed bug.

[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.140]
We want to tell you about bagels and company right now at 110th and Biscayne Boulevard.

[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:37.680]
Fantastic fresh, delicious bagels and biolies and hand-picked whitefish,

[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:41.960]
sabre, locks, nova, kippred salmon, fancy lake, sturgeon, egg salad, white meat, tuna,

[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.420]
crab meat, shrimp salad.

[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:46.360]
And if you're into pastrami, somebody of the other day was in here and they said,

[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.400]
you can't get a good pastrami sandwich in this neck of the woods.

[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:54.080]
You're dreaming, boy, they have got pastrami that's every bit as good as what you got up north.

[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:57.580]
See, part of the problem with pastrami down here is you've got all these people over the age of 100

[00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:00.060]
and they like it real dry with no taste.

[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:00.480]
Okay.

[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.020]
So that it like crumbles in their mouth and they don't have to chew it.

[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:09.000]
But if you want a great pastrami or corn-beef sandwich, then bagels and company will put one together for you that'll knock your socks off.

[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:09.320]
Okay.

[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:13.760]
They're open for breakfast and lunch seven days a week starting early, six in the A&N.

[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.220]
And they also put together sensational party planters.

[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:21.600]
They just give them a couple of days notice and you can either pick it up or they'll deliver it right to your door within a five mile radius.

[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.220]
Bagels and company we are delighted to have found them.

[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.140]
They do a super job.

[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:33.980]
They're at 110 Biscayne Boulevard right in Miami and here's their phone number eight nine two twenty four thirty five eight eighty nine bagel is the easiest way to remember.

[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:38.360]
Bagels and company just look for the white building with the blue awnings a hundred tenths in Biscayne.

[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.460]
Friday morning seven twenty a.m.

[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:48.340]
Migrenary reads a six ten W.I.O.D. soft floor to sweepstakes winning number two three one seven three four one.

[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.120]
It didn't take long for a listener to claim some cash.

[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.360]
Frank what can I do for you?

[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.040]
I like a thousand dollars.

[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.460]
You like a thousand dollars?

[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.400]
Is that what it is?

[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.160]
Why would you like a thousand dollars?

[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.340]
I have to win a number.

[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.900]
Congratulations Frank.

[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:02.740]
Oh that's great.

[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:09.140]
Listen for your winning soft floor to sweepstakes number throughout the day and get ready to grab your share of the cash.

[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:13.600]
And congratulations to our most recent winner Frank Patrick I am.

[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:18.080]
Frank I believe it's from Newstalk Radio 610 W.I.O.D.

[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:20.440]
What's this?

[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.540]
W.I.O.D.?

[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.880]
Here's Andy Loonie, star of 60 Bickets.

[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.480]
You know what bothers me?

[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:33.940]
Whatever you try and buy some new dungaries you can never find a pair that fits just right.

[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:38.480]
That's why I helped design denim pants for people like me.

[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:42.640]
Introducing Andy Loonie's Watered Down jeans.

[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.200]
Oh sure they look old and wrinkly like me.

[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.960]
But they're made of 100% cotton.

[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.480]
Pickin' no good, welfare.

[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:52.640]
Andy, Andy.

[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.480]
Oh sorry.

[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.680]
Anyway just watch what happens when I yank on a pair.

[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:05.980]
You see they fit so snug in the crotch they cut off circulation to your brain.

[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:13.300]
And at no time you'll start saying things that make no sense at all, especially about minority types.

[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:14.840]
Darn.

[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:19.260]
Look, I know what it's like to get caught with your pants down.

[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:25.840]
So they had discriminating shopper like me by Andy Loonie Watered Down jeans.

[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:27.460]
I think they're great.

[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.920]
But hey, I'm prejudice.

[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:34.820]
By the way talk about a big joke last night at the end of 60 minutes they were doing the thing with the letters you know.

[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.640]
And most of the letters were about Andy Roonie.

[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:45.060]
And there was Mike Wallace, good old right wing Mike Wallace sitting there telling us about the overwhelming majority of you sided with Andy.

[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.140]
And this is also ridiculous and he read a couple of stupid letters.

[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.020]
I just wanted to fall on the floor and puke my lunch breakfast in dinner.

[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.520]
Which yesterday was non-stop.

[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.160]
Man I ate from the time I got up in the morning until the time I went to bed.

[00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.980]
It was tremendous and all of it was great.

[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.940]
Here's little Joey sitting around waiting for lunch is not great.

[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.640]
Let's go to a mobile and four-letter day.

[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.320]
Pick up these call or wait a minute.

[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:07.680]
Hello.

[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.240]
Neil.

[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:08.700]
Yeah.

[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.360]
Just want to ask you did you take Saturday night live?

[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.260]
No, I did not.

[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.800]
I don't watch Saturday night live.

[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.000]
I thought you would have made an example.

[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.480]
Saturday night live has not a good show in 15 years.

[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:21.800]
Oh, last night where I was Saturday night was the you Tyler showing more body than he showed in ages.

[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.000]
Well, you can watch the videos.

[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.260]
He's got his naked in all the videos anyway.

[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.660]
So he was just about naked.

[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.940]
He was showing parts that you know don't even.

[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.120]
This data that they got to put a bag over his head though.

[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.340]
You know, I'm embarrassed.

[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:39.360]
I'm never going to live down the fact that I really once upon a time because they show him so briefly like a hundredth of a second.

[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.660]
You know, for I mean the face and now I know why.

[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:43.760]
They were going a lot of face.

[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.120]
Very nice.

[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.780]
He was so ugly.

[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:46.540]
Yeah.

[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.420]
He's gruesome.

[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:47.980]
He's frightening.

[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.420]
It was it was scary but he was showing all kinds of well Neil be having.

[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.160]
Yeah, well for a 40-year-old guy he does have a good body.

[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.380]
Yeah, he's that old?

[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:55.960]
Yeah.

[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.700]
But his face shows his body I guess must have been protected.

[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.460]
The drugs must not have affected below the neck.

[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.460]
No, they did.

[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.440]
But above the neck man they did a wicked job.

[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.440]
That was never recovered.

[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.240]
Those lips and mouth.

[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:08.780]
He could French kids have moved.

[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:09.460]
Exactly.

[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.780]
Anyway, that probably has knowing him.

[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.640]
Hey, everybody has a thrill somewhere.

[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.240]
You bet.

[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.100]
Anyway, so the hell with Andy Rooney and I'll talk to you later.

[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:18.820]
Okay, sir.

[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:19.240]
Bye.

[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:19.840]
A rep at Arch.

[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.440]
1042 as they say on the Larry King show.

[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.560]
We do have it opening in Broward now and one in date and one in Palm Beach.

[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:26.320]
Isn't that amazing?

[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.260]
As soon as he hung up two other lines went out.

[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.620]
Boy, this is one of those really bizarre, psychotic days.

[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:32.700]
There's this is an omen.

[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.220]
Where did I see that horse?

[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.500]
I think it's at Pompano tonight.

[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.560]
Boy, if you don't go up there and plunge your gutshot and it's Jeff Gregory too,

[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.040]
who hasn't been doing squat lately.

[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.400]
But he's got a horse in the 12th race tonight, the one horse.

[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.860]
And the name of the horse is Perinoid.

[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.600]
And boy, that doesn't fit in perfectly with this day.

[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:54.120]
So if I were you, I'd go up to Pompano tonight and plunge thousands on that horse.

[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.440]
Okay, just plunge your gutshot.

[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:56.760]
Here's another mobile.

[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.300]
Are they there?

[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.180]
Yes, they are.

[00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:58.760]
Excellent.

[00:39:58.940 --> 00:39:59.440]
Very good.

[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:00.040]
I think.

[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.500]
How is your presence day going?

[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.640]
Oh, fabulous.

[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.720]
Boy, I tell you, President McKinley would be proud.

[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.020]
That, that, uh, Kennedy thing has been three parts.

[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.200]
Yeah, I noticed Wednesday is the third part.

[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.120]
I'd select, that's a little much, isn't it?

[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.420]
Well, why did they skip Tuesday?

[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.040]
Oh, they do skip Tuesday.

[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.240]
Well, because they got some crap on it.

[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.520]
I guess they want everybody to see.

[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:18.920]
I don't know.

[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.320]
I don't pay any attention to those networks.

[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.400]
So I don't know what's on.

[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.260]
Well, I can understand why they skip Tuesday.

[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.740]
But you were talking about Ritz's foot clappers.

[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:27.620]
What's his name?

[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:28.480]
Ritz, I believe.

[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.240]
Ritz Suttov.

[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.460]
I was on the air check, yeah.

[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.780]
And I brought this baseball magazine produced by Major League Baseball

[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.920]
and they were all over the Cubs pitching staff.

[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.480]
I mean, they were saying, when you get past Greg Mottik,

[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:40.660]
it's all over.

[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.340]
It's night, night.

[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.820]
But I wanted to fact you, uh, the whole thing about the Cubs,

[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.720]
they got a scatter report on them and a whole thing.

[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.920]
They've never even come down on Mike by leaky.

[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:50.320]
But I'm not doing this.

[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:51.740]
Oh, oh.

[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.240]
Oh, my.

[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.540]
God, that's worse than attacking the Bible.

[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.340]
Are you crazy?

[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:57.120]
No, I'm serious.

[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.660]
What the hell was wrong with Balecki?

[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.660]
He was, what, 18 and 8 or something like that?

[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:01.880]
What the hell is wrong with him?

[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.740]
They said he'd be lucky to win 10 games this year.

[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:04.960]
Oh, my God.

[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.080]
Who wrote this?

[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.440]
Somebody from the Metz No Doubt.

[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:10.940]
I don't know who wrote it.

[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.100]
I'm not sure who wrote it.

[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.320]
But, um, did you see where they picked the Cubs last year?

[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.660]
They picked them a fourth or fifth.

[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:18.140]
Right.

[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:18.900]
So they know what they're like.

[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:19.620]
What the hell do they know?

[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:20.140]
I know a lot.

[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.440]
Did you see where Mitch Webb's your went?

[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:22.700]
Yeah, to Cleveland.

[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:23.200]
Cleveland.

[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.660]
The million and a half or something.

[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:25.840]
I knew that would break your heart.

[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:26.700]
The only Chicago.

[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:27.900]
That's old news.

[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.380]
That's ancient news.

[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.200]
Oh, I know.

[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:31.720]
But I'd never call you, so.

[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.760]
Well, I know, but it's like from, why are we talking baseball?

[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:35.560]
They're not playing.

[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.480]
God only knows if they're going to play its disgusting.

[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.260]
Well, I'm depressed.

[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:39.860]
As usual, the fans get screwed.

[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.920]
Okay, that's what sports is all about.

[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:42.600]
There you go.

[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:44.820]
Everybody's making big bucks and the fans get screwed.

[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:45.580]
There you go.

[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.800]
I agree with you, bud.

[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:47.760]
I'm just depressed.

[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.820]
Like, I got to bring it up.

[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.200]
Okay, so to speak.

[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:50.940]
Have a great day.

[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.220]
1045 at WIOD.

[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:54.300]
Everybody's depressed today.

[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:54.680]
What happened?

[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.720]
The dolphins lose yesterday?

[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.100]
Must have been an unpublished workout.

[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:01.280]
We have an opening in Broward 524 WIOD.

[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:04.520]
Or maybe a lot of you went to the track over the weekend and you drowned in a sea of chalk.

[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.240]
That's possible like some of the rest of us.

[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.820]
All those real, real short prices.

[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.320]
Three to five and one to two.

[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.280]
We don't want that crap.

[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:11.740]
Okay.

[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.040]
Bring back those 25 and 40 and $60 horses.

[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.040]
That's where it's at.

[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.640]
The hell with all these.

[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:20.920]
And by the way, I have a little tip for you when you go out to go out.

[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:21.280]
You know, you know, you're just going to have a little bit of a rough stream.

[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.160]
Just look in your program and it's only 50 cents.

[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.660]
Even in fact, Rich could afford a buy program if he weren't so cheap.

[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.860]
And look at the program and look for all the horses that Hasinto Vazquez is riding and just cross him out.

[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:35.060]
Just get a big crayon and when in doubt, cross him out.

[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:35.360]
Okay.

[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.240]
Boy, he is not that I bet him.

[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.380]
This isn't sour grapes because I wouldn't bet him with your money.

[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.160]
But he just comes down here and it's just brutal.

[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.460]
I mean, there are no words to describe what he does when he's here.

[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:47.420]
Let's, let's see.

[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.520]
A mobile and four lotter day.

[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.920]
I think I, is that the one I just did?

[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.280]
Is that another one?

[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.280]
Hello.

[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.080]
Hello.

[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:54.400]
You're not a mobile, are you?

[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:54.940]
No, not.

[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:55.900]
Well, you lucked out.

[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.180]
He's got it all screwed up here.

[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.180]
He doesn't know what's going on.

[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.540]
Listen, I was diving Key West and, uh...

[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:02.320]
Isn't that something?

[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.700]
No, it's here he is.

[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:04.920]
Uh, listen into...

[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:06.300]
What is it?

[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.440]
FM107.

[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:10.460]
Uh, Donnie Osmond was sitting in for the shadow.

[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:11.420]
Yeah, she was.

[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:12.480]
She was an American top 40.

[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:13.520]
Oh, I see.

[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:14.540]
Great.

[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.420]
So, pretty exciting stuff.

[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.040]
Pretty heavy duty, huh?

[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:19.760]
Yeah.

[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:23.600]
Oh.

[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.280]
Automatical.

[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:24.740]
Okay, I'll deal.

[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.400]
Okay, well, I'm sure glad we got the exciting weekend out of the way.

[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.540]
Okay, so I'll go back to terminal boredom.

[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.100]
Thank you, sir.

[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:30.360]
All right.

[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:31.980]
Okay, that's what this is all about.

[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:35.060]
People are a little bit shaken because there were a few too many things going on this weekend.

[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.440]
And now we're just getting ready to go back on that downhill slide.

[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.900]
In fact, they're doing skiing on the ESPN right now.

[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.960]
And it reminds me of tourism in this town.

[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.680]
We're just getting ready to go on that straight downhill slide

[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.880]
until like the middle of July when it really gets heavy duty here.

[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:51.500]
We have an open line in Palm Beach, 6559.

[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.360]
Well, it's so hot in July.

[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:54.280]
It all good.

[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.300]
How come if it's so hot in July and August?

[00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:57.260]
And that's why nobody's here.

[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:03.180]
How come I can honle Lulu or a 10 Y key where it takes $8 billion and a million hours to get there from anywhere.

[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.880]
How come they're all packed up and you can't even get a hotel room?

[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.480]
And it's 87, 90 degrees every stinkin' day.

[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.100]
And don't tell me about the trade winds.

[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:11.680]
It's hot.

[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.100]
I mean, I like it, but it's hot.

[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.900]
How come they're up packed and they don't have any gambling.

[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:26.440]
They don't have anything except a lot of fun and a lot of bodies and a lot of ocean and a lot of good times and great food and lu-aus and stuff and living and breathing people under the age of 100.

[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:27.860]
Maybe that's what it takes.

[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.560]
Ooh, he said something terrible, right?

[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.320]
A Gilbert report from Cooper City.

[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.980]
This is like becoming a nightmare.

[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:34.620]
Hello.

[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.720]
Yes, Neil Gilbert has really stepped up in the world now.

[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:38.540]
Okay, good.

[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:39.680]
Let's pack him a sandwich.

[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:46.640]
He's calling sports talk shows and he started with the media giant Bruce Warner, Sunday night.

[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.600]
Bruce Warner.

[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.340]
Yes, he related to...

[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:49.740]
You're the UAM.

[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:50.500]
Warner Wolf?

[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.020]
Bruce Warner.

[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:52.980]
I never heard of him.

[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:53.740]
Media giant.

[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:54.120]
Yeah.

[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:59.160]
And he mentioned your name and Bruce Warner says we don't want to talk about that guy, not on this station.

[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.220]
Oh, except in the morning.

[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:02.520]
Except in the morning, right?

[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.400]
Great. Well, that's good.

[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.080]
I'm glad Gilbert's stayin' busy, okay?

[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:07.780]
Yeah, okay, Neil.

[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:08.520]
Thank you, sir.

[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.000]
Gilbert, please, give it a rest.

[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:11.560]
Would you...

[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:16.300]
Somebody's got to just take Gilbert's phone and put it on hold for a few months.

[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.940]
We have an opening on the Palm Beach Line, 6559463.

[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.140]
This first hour is deadly.

[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:23.060]
It's almost over with, but it's been deadly.

[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.120]
Let's tell you about Toyota of Hollywood.

[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:27.320]
Then when we come back, I know the calls are really going to pick up.

[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.980]
I apologize for about the first half dozen people who all thought they were comedians today.

[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.740]
I shouldn't have to, but I mean, they were embarrassing.

[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:36.720]
And I think that's kind of stemming from this new amateur comedy hour.

[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.980]
That seems to be sweeping the nation as far as talk format is concerned.

[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.200]
Amateur comedians.

[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:46.040]
Speaking of that, by the way, the Alex Barnett show this afternoon,

[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:49.660]
and the Johnny Walker National Comedy Search with Bud Friedman,

[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.540]
comes to the Alex Bennett show.

[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:54.660]
Oh, that's the guy that stands in the nightclub on that thing on TV.

[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:56.020]
Is that the guy stands over in a corner?

[00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:58.900]
And laughs like crazy.

[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:02.840]
And the comedian, Anna Collins, and this is Stripper Week, et cetera,

[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.440]
and free food in our live studio audience.

[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.500]
And good luck to you all.

[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.680]
Anyway, Toyota of Hollywood's got some fabulous used automobiles.

[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.840]
If you're in the market for one, instead of buying from one of those fly-by-night side of the road,

[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.780]
use car dealers and every town's got them.

[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:17.500]
There's always used car row.

[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.820]
And most of them are on 441 in this town, which is interesting,

[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.780]
because Toyota of Hollywood is also on 441,

[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:27.780]
so you don't have to travel far off the beaten path to get a great deal on a real quality used automobile.

[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:29.640]
And you know they're going to be there when you come back,

[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.720]
and you know you're going to get fantastic service too.

[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:35.920]
And 85 Mazda 626, 5-door hatchback loaded with extras,

[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.980]
low mileage only 4995.

[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:43.520]
And 89 Nissan Centra Tutor with air conditioning and low mileage only 5995.

[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:48.220]
And 85 Buick Park Avenue Ford or loaded, 5988.

[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:51.580]
And 88 Suzuki Jeep with only 19,000 miles on it,

[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:53.840]
just 4995 in like new condition.

[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:57.560]
And 86 Ford Taurus in like new condition with low mileage,

[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.740]
4495, 3 solid acres of great dependable used automobiles.

[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:06.440]
And of course right across the street, all those hot new 90s waiting for you at unbeatably low prices.

[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:10.260]
It's Toyota of Hollywood, you'll find them at 1841 North State Road 7.

[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:13.680]
That's 441 between Taft and Sheridan Streets in Hollywood.

[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:21.460]
Okay, this is very timely, you know, we were just talking about our friend.

[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.940]
And I'm reading this article about where the kids are going for spring break,

[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.140]
and then I'll come into for a lot of time.

[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:29.200]
And I quote directly from the Sun sent, and listen to this,

[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:35.500]
says a lot of kids are wanting tours to the Caribbean because of the damage caused by the tornadoes and hurricanes or whatever,

[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:37.880]
prices are down, Gilbert said.

[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:42.100]
And the Bahamas are anxiously going after spring breakers.

[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:48.340]
So Gilbert is everywhere, man. He's got his finger on the pulse of it all, sports of talk, of tourism.

[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.640]
You name it and Gilbert's got his finger on it. Boka.

[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:52.820]
Yeah, how are you doing now?

[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:53.240]
Okay.

[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.900]
I must not be watching Sally then.

[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:55.780]
No.

[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.000]
Guess you would not guess who has dawned to her screen.

[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:00.760]
Well, how about the Debbie Ellis?

[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.200]
Our senior hall.

[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:05.540]
Oh, God. Well, she does run a free show, so that speaks for itself.

[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:07.540]
He's fitting for fit right in.

[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.240]
Anyway, I was talking, I was listening to you about Eucino Vesquares.

[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:11.300]
Yeah.

[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.580]
What's going on on the phone there? Is somebody strongly on the cord?

[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.360]
I'm quite sure.

[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.740]
But I think the men's is using it as a sash cord.

[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.300]
Anyway, what's the deal with him?

[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.560]
You really hate him a lot, or what?

[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.400]
What is the deal with him?

[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.500]
Well, you know what they say about a fool and his money are soon parted?

[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:29.260]
That's the deal with him at Gulfstream.

[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:31.360]
He is nowhere, 90% of the time.

[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:35.400]
I mean, like maybe one out of every 10 times, it looks like he's going somewhere.

[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.240]
And the rest of the time, it's like, hey, how are you doing?

[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.340]
You know, it's just nowhere. I mean, can't get arrested.

[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:46.140]
Well, the thing I've noticed about him is, like, he's the first to call a foul, you know, when he raises over and he's...

[00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.820]
Well, how can you call a foul when you're running ninth the whole mile?

[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:49.780]
It's pretty different.

[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:54.280]
It's a five shot, so you know, he expects everyone to give him a rail, you know, right on through, you know,

[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.400]
and have an easy win.

[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:58.620]
And if you actually just bump him or even breathe on him, I'm sorry.
