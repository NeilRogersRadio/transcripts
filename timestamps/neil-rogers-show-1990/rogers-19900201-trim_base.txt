[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780]
WIOD presents Neal Rogers.

[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.840]
To get in touch and talk, call 751WIOD in date.

[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.160]
524 WIOD in Brawler, or 655-278 WIOD in the Palm Beach.

[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.820]
Other areas make all collect.

[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.840]
The opinions expressed by the host guests or callers are not necessarily those of the station.

[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.780]
Now, here's Neal Rogers, on New Start Radio 610-WIOD.

[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.580]
Now, this is a client call.

[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.340]
Now, this guy who I am in the hospital, or are you with the son of a kept client?

[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.460]
Or are you with the son of a kept client?

[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.500]
What?

[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.440]
Oatmeal cookies.

[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.060]
Not ours.

[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.340]
You notice how he came in here and he's talking with a mic, but he's losing it.

[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.240]
He really is losing it.

[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.680]
All he wants is the food.

[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.340]
Anyway, we got a lot of food.

[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.620]
We got the Nealys here.

[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.680]
We got the BLT.

[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.560]
Great.

[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.100]
Good stuff.

[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.660]
Thank you, Bernadette, and Wayne and all our friends over there.

[00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.920]
You just continue to be the best.

[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.640]
I have a one more Nealie Burger and that's it.

[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.940]
And lemonade.

[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.960]
Good stuff.

[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.620]
Good stuff.

[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.340]
Okay, what are we doing, Melvin?

[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.540]
What are we doing now?

[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.240]
I've kind of lost track.

[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.260]
That guy from New Times.

[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.600]
If he ever comes back into building, I'm going to punch him in a mile.

[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.780]
He was a puny little guy anyway.

[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.020]
It's the kind of guy I like to punch.

[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.020]
Puny defenseless.

[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.980]
Anyway, let's take a lady in North Bimy Beach.

[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.020]
Hello.

[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.920]
Good morning.

[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.480]
Hi.

[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.360]
Hello Neal.

[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.640]
I just thought I'd love to tell you this.

[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.940]
I'm sure it will make you happy.

[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.060]
Well, that's good because you know what an unhappy miserable SOBI.

[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.440]
I have never found that.

[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.660]
So, what's the bird said?

[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.660]
What bird?

[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.460]
Never heard of it.

[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.200]
The Shirley Bird.

[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.000]
I know.

[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.060]
Yes, that's what I want to talk about.

[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.780]
We have just returned from Vegas.

[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.340]
And do you know what I noticed that?

[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.100]
What?

[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.300]
I noticed an absence of Canadian plates on the cars.

[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.520]
Good.

[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.460]
When is it plainly?

[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.860]
They just don't come to Vegas.

[00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.340]
I wonder why they don't know how to...

[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.040]
Are you kidding me?

[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.420]
No, because it would be so cheap for them to eat.

[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.020]
You know it.

[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.720]
You get food there for nothing.

[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.780]
Don't spread it around.

[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.960]
Although it's something to think about.

[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.740]
Listen, I can get on it highway 10 right now and head out of here like a bad out of hell.

[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.320]
At least 20-30 miles an hour.

[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.200]
Right, if you tell them that they can get breakfast for $2 and dinner for $5,

[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.520]
that will clear Miami.

[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.360]
I thought you ought to spread it around.

[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.700]
Great. Well, we have been spreading it around with a shovel.

[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.840]
When are you going back there?

[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.400]
When?

[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.000]
To Vegas.

[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.820]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.220]
It's wonderful.

[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.500]
I've been here a million times.

[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.040]
I'm just saving my money for a rainy day.

[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.860]
Like I'm solving it away like a school does with nuts.

[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.120]
I've been some of it at the Marage.

[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.680]
You'll love it.

[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.180]
That's why I heard everybody says it's beyond belief.

[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.960]
It is, it is.

[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.240]
Okay. Well, we don't want anything like that here.

[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.300]
Oh, God, you come back here and you just...

[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.000]
It's so depressing when you get out of the airport.

[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.520]
But do you know your back because immediately you start hearing Spanish?

[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.980]
Have a nice day.

[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.480]
You too.

[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.260]
Buenos dias.

[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.280]
Oh, God.

[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.980]
It's 11-08 at WIOD.

[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.000]
We have an opening in Date County, 7519-463.

[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.800]
Bokeh and Pambi-Ch also wide open.

[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.460]
What the hell happened, boy?

[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.060]
Well, we started out like a house on a fire that guy from...

[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.140]
It's all Nick's fault, really.

[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.180]
Don't rip the guy from New Times.

[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.660]
It's Nick.

[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.180]
That Nickhead.

[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.440]
If he ever did anything right, I would just pass out.

[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.620]
Although he did get Donny Osman on a show that one time.

[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.940]
I'm trying to think of anything else he ever did that was even close to being right.

[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.960]
I can't, I gotta be honest.

[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.820]
I can't think of one.

[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.800]
North Miami Beach.

[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.500]
Hello.

[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.140]
Yeah.

[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.460]
How's it going, Neil?

[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.200]
Okay.

[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.220]
Hey.

[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.740]
That show yesterday was great.

[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.960]
Wasn't it?

[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.380]
Yeah.

[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.240]
Yeah, we should have just played the tape back today and I could have stayed home, got some stuff done.

[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.120]
No kidding.

[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.440]
Get a shot of my pellets in my neighbor's yard.

[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.160]
When you had to read that promo, it was...

[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.080]
The best.

[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.460]
I think you ought to do a voiceovers.

[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.860]
Don't you?

[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.160]
You ought to call the agencies, man.

[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.480]
You ought to sign up with the ad team.

[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.420]
No kidding.

[00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.920]
I couldn't stop laughing.

[00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.680]
So anyways.

[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.120]
I call in sick to work today.

[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.680]
And they go, okay, you might as well quit.

[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.360]
Do you believe that?

[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.680]
What the hell does that mean?

[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.620]
You might as well quit.

[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.540]
In other words, you're not entitled to be sick?

[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.240]
Although you don't say, you don't.

[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.540]
It's not.

[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.900]
You don't sound sick though.

[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.500]
Well, it's not, you know, like sick stomach because I hurt my hip.

[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.400]
Oh.

[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.700]
So I can barely walk and I drive around.

[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.000]
You know how I drive around on the car.

[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.960]
What kind of bastards do you work for anyway?

[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.640]
Not nice.

[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.340]
Sounds like this place.

[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.500]
Yeah, yeah, right?

[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.120]
So anyway, I want to call Felix the Dusebag.

[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.580]
Okay.

[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.400]
Well listen, good luck in your job hunting.

[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.000]
I know somebody you'd probably like to spend some time with him.

[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.200]
He could go out and pedal latch on to you.

[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.780]
You know, when you find a new job, he can be your hip kick.

[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.860]
Yeah, right?

[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.520]

[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.800]
All right, and you'll take an easy...

[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.300]
Good luck, pal.

[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.860]
You'll need it.

[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.680]
Ten minutes after 11 at WID and Open Line and Data,

[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.800]
if you move real fast now,

[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.880]
that's our little psychological Steve King game that we like to play with the audience.

[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.700]
If you rush, if you move quickly, 751 WIOD.

[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.120]
Too bad that he's not going to be dead in New York, isn't it?

[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.420]
I want to hear from everybody who's upset that Steve's not kicking ass in New York.

[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:11.900]
A mobile in Miami.

[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.220]
Hello.

[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.040]
How you doing?

[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.500]
My name is Bruce and I just want to tell you have a new fan and that's me.

[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.520]
Well, that's great, Bruce.

[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.060]
I've been hearing your name and my family for about six months now.

[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.280]
And I took my wife's car.

[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.140]
It turned the radio on.

[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.300]
Here came 610, which I've never turned on in my life.

[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.220]
And I think you're the greatest.

[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.100]
Well, you're right, Bruce.

[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.200]
Thank you very kindly.

[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.100]
You have excellent taste and a wonderful wife.

[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.140]
You're right on both counts.

[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.580]
Okay.

[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.220]
Thanks a lot.

[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.860]
Good luck to you, Bruce.

[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.240]
Thank you.

[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.260]
You'll need it with a name like that.

[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.520]
It's 11 after 11 at WID.

[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.960]
When we come back after the break now, I see I shouldn't do this because then they'll all hang up.

[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.440]
And I don't want you to do that because that'll make me very angry.

[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.740]
Like Michael said in the Godfather, that'll make me very angry.

[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.000]
In fact, if you ever seen Michael Corleone and Gilbert together, I don't think so.

[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.120]
Didn't he have kind of like a little quagga layer too?

[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:06.120]
I think he also went to the Bob Koozy school of something of articulation.

[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.920]
Anyway, we got that dick-perton stuff from what is the station he's on now?

[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.680]
Q95, I mean, your KQI in Detroit.

[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.420]
And there are two, by the way, I'm just giving you advanced notice, Melvin.

[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.300]
There are two bits back to back that I want to play.

[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.140]
They run into each other, but just let it go.

[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.020]
In fact, I think the last thing he says is dick.

[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.100]
Uh, pertin, no.

[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.360]
It's Wings Plus that we're talking about right now.

[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.540]
I'm getting so disorganized.

[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.100]
Q95, WID.

[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.640]
Should we take the mobile before we do a dick-perton?

[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.620]
We better do it.

[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.840]
If they're still there in Del Rey.

[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.800]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.680]
Great, sir.

[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.920]
How are you doing?

[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.420]
Wonderful.

[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.640]
Listen, man, last yesterday's show is the best.

[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.000]
And I'd really like to start the Gilbert fan club.

[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.580]
All right.

[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.360]
He's definitely the hidden cult hero.

[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.660]
He was a spice of life.

[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.500]
All our friends were talking about him.

[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.540]
It was really funny to ya.

[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.140]
Take me to an abogame.

[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.940]
Oh, that's great.

[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.920]
He's the best.

[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.500]
Yeah, is it possible to get a copy of that tape?

[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.900]
You know, the best of Gilbert?

[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.800]
The best of Gilbert.

[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.980]
We're working on it right now.

[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.140]
Coming to a music store in here soon.

[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.640]
Sure.

[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.020]
Yeah.

[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.000]
And with each, if anybody wants to start the fan club, we'll give one bumper sticker

[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.240]
along if you love Gilbert and the Big Gilbert T-shirt.

[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.480]
And the...

[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.800]
I don't forget Joey made a real boner yesterday.

[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.000]
If I can say that, he invited Gilbert to be a guest on his show this Saturday.

[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.180]
I have a feeling that one of them will not be on the show the following Saturday.

[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.180]
And it might not be Gilbert.

[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.860]
Oh, no, I don't think so.

[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.860]
He's pretty funny, guy.

[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.620]
He's the best.

[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.280]
Yeah, he is.

[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.180]
He really put out a lot of talent yesterday.

[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.560]
Okay, we'll see you around.

[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:44.860]
Bye-bye.

[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.220]
Bye.

[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.980]
Okay, 1117 at W.A.D., I want you to listen to this stuff very carefully.

[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.620]
These two cuts, if you don't whet your pants, listening to this, you just have no sense of humor at all.

[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.400]
Good morning, Dick.

[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.980]
Ronald Reagan, sports commentator on the new Q95 FM.

[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.260]
Nice to hear from you, Mr. former president.

[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.840]
And what is your sports commentary about this morning, Dutch?

[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.460]
Well, I've got my NFL outlook.

[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.700]
Ah, believe it or not, the NFL season began over the weekend with the first of your exhibition games being played.

[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.400]
Well, I'm totally opposed to exhibitionists playing football.

[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:15.700]
What?

[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.740]
It might be fun for the crowd to see those naked players.

[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.700]
No, no, Dutch Dutch dangerous without any equipment.

[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.280]
Sir, it's really tough on the center.

[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.040]
Yeah, sir.

[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.280]
Sir, exhibition games are not played by exhibitionists.

[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.020]
Oh, that's right.

[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.640]
Their sport is volleyball.

[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.780]
Yeah, well, that's a lot of truth to that.

[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.360]
That is one of the big games that notice camps are you right?

[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.780]
Oh, which one do you go to?

[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.820]
No, no, no, sir.

[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.100]
I don't go to the camps.

[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.680]
Nancy and I like camp lot of troops.

[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.220]
Do you?

[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.340]
It's near Fresno.

[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.840]
It's near Fresno, guys.

[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.360]
I do.

[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.520]
Sir, what about the Lions this year?

[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.120]
Well, I picked them for the Super Bowl.

[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:56.660]
You do?

[00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.240]
How do you figure that, Dutch?

[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.800]
Well, they've got a new stretch offense.

[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.280]
And the idea of the Lions winning Super Bowl is really stretching.

[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.140]
Well, that's for sure.

[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260]
Thank you for calling, Mr. former president.

[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.760]
Okay, Deika.

[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.380]
Bye-bye.

[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:11.740]
Bye-bye.

[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.140]
All right, Nancy.

[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.040]
Let's try some short passes.

[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.820]
I'll go down to the coffee table and then look back to the bookcase.

[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:28.980]
Ladies and gentlemen, with the election tomorrow, our editorial board here at the Z thought it was important for you to hear one last debate between the candidates.

[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:35.460]
Both parties turned down our offer about the top men, but have agreed to the two vice presidential candidates.

[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.720]
So on the line with me now, our Senator Benson and Senator Quail.

[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:40.660]
Welcome, gentlemen.

[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.700]
I miss the button.

[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.860]
This won't take too long, Lord.

[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.160]
I got an early tea time.

[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.220]
30, hey, there you go.

[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:45.820]
He did not.

[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.420]
Did you?

[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.860]
Did you promise?

[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.280]
That's right, Senator Benson.

[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.660]
You did agree not to use the K word.

[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.520]
Oh, sorry.

[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.060]
I don't have my prune juice, yeah.

[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.280]
It's not myself.

[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:55.820]
That's right.

[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.460]
Gentlemen, what about the issues?

[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.700]
I'm glad you brought that up.

[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.840]
I was just reading an old issue of golf, I guess, there.

[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.320]
No, not those issues, Senator.

[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.120]
What are your parties going to do about, for example, taxes?

[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.940]
I think we'll carry taxes.

[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:08.540]
No.

[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.900]
I'm a Senator here.

[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:10.320]
I know you.

[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.380]
Why did you mess up?

[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.660]
He said, tax it.

[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.040]
It's not.

[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:13.640]
It's not.

[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.600]
Yeah, you know Linda Johnson.

[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.060]
What the hell are you talking about?

[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.100]
I finally got your back.

[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.620]
You know, Kennedy had a bad back.

[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.180]
You did not.

[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.320]
Gentlemen, let's talk about your chances now of winning, all right?

[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.080]
I've got my Z-line, we take it right here.

[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:27.440]
No, no.

[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.940]
I got a real good shot.

[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.840]
No, that's not the Quail.

[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.260]
I meant the election.

[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.080]
Haven't had one of those in here.

[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.500]
No, no, no, that's not the question.

[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.720]
I had them all the time.

[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.160]
That's why you were fooling around.

[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:37.740]
You were not.

[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.980]
I was going to get you in here.

[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.500]
All right, gentlemen, thank you for being here and having a good day.

[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.440]
Senator, best of luck.

[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.080]
Okay, 20.

[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.400]
Oh, 20 after 11 at WID.

[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.500]
Just kind of material here on South Florida Radio.

[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.120]
Take part in Q95 in Detroit.

[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.800]
There's a whole tape.

[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.640]
And this is the second one.

[00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.600]
I only wish our tape was as funny as this.

[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.840]
This is the second best of pertin benefiting children's hospital of Michigan.

[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.620]
It's on a cassette.

[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:04.760]
And the same.

[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.040]
If you want to go up to Detroit, you can probably buy it in a record store.

[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.500]
Okay, 20 past 11 at WID.

[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.060]
We have an open line in Palm Beach at 655 WID.

[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260]
There's tons of stuff on it I can set by the way every day.

[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.200]
That'll be a good hook to get people to look at that.

[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:24.680]
There's a 715 cuts on here.

[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.100]
We might play a couple more later on today.

[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.280]
Okay, when we get to our law, about 1230.

[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.780]
First floor to the radio.

[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:21.400]

[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:21.400]

[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:21.400]

[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:21.400]

[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:21.400]

[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.140]
This is the first floor to the radio.

[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.280]
This is the first floor to the radio.

[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.020]
This is the first floor to the radio.

[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.180]
This is the first floor to the radio.

[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.300]
This is the first floor to the radio.

[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.760]
This is the first floor to the radio.

[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:36.540]
This is the first floor to the radio.

[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.380]
This is the first floor to the radio.

[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.360]
This is the first floor to the radio.

[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.420]
This is the first floor to the radio.

[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:46.300]
This is the first floor to the radio.

[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:49.640]
It's in the hood.

[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.980]
Okay, let's hear from 25 past 11 at WID.

[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.100]
That's a worthy, and we make sure to call it interesting.

[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:05.920]
Hello, hi Stan Stan. Yeah, Neil. Oh, how you doing Joe? Good. It seems everybody in the business likes to rip each other last night

[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:12.280]
I was in my car and I accidentally punched up Craig Worthing and night that night. Yeah, what was he doing on at night?

[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.280]
I don't know but he was on last night and he was ripping

[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.320]
Stan

[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:22.080]
Saying that now stands on at night and he says all stands callers ever do

[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:29.520]
Just say how great he is and he says all stand does it say mobile mobile and he says why don't you get a show Stan

[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.120]
He's that's all you ever say his mobile and your callers say you're great

[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:39.460]
He says Stan you have to do something in order to be great at it. He said you have no show really

[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:44.640]
Continue to rip him. I couldn't believe it. That sounds very much unlike Craig. Are you sure was Craig? Maybe it was Ernie

[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:50.100]
Oh, I'm sorry. You're right. Yeah Craig would never do that Craig is on first of all mid days on right now

[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.360]
And the UFT always a good friend of mine. He didn't he doesn't do that Craig is just too

[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.960]
Too nice of a guy to do that but Ernie of course for everybody now

[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:03.100]
Let's look back at those big numbers Ernie had in the book a point two a point one and a point three at a boy Ernie

[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.080]
And he's ripping I guess that's right. It was Ernie because now stands on

[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.580]
Yeah, now he's got some competition

[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.880]
He might not even show up in a book. He might be like the motivation station hopefully. Yeah

[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.440]
I just thought I'd give it a little bit of an excellent reports sir. Thank you

[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.900]
All right, even though we had the wrong name 27 after 11 at W I O D

[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.760]
We had an opening and what do we do? We have it opening and brown

[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:30.520]
At 524 W I O D here's Miami. Hello. Hello. Yeah, you mentioned something about

[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:35.440]
Jicco whatever heck his name has had an article on Dix Farrell. Yes

[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:41.540]
What newspaper would it well? It's in the Sun Sentinel because that's a one at the Tom writes for it's on page 9

[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.080]
E today on the radio and the entertainment page

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.900]
I'm in Miami. You're in Miami? Well drive up to

[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.480]
Hallendale see Sunny Rosenberg while you're there. I can't drive also

[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.720]
I'd like you to possibly repeat that whatever Rosenberg or

[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.920]
Something about strip bars. Yeah, Sunny wants the commissioners all do they don't have any in Hallendale

[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.820]
So he wants them to go on little a junket to a neighboring city and

[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:10.000]
Visit a topless bar and get perspired and worked up to a frenzy watching

[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.860]
So they can do a little research as to whether they should pass a no-nude

[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.920]
Club place in ordinance in Hallendale

[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.340]
Yeah, okay the trick to the work the word is horny sir desperate

[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.100]
The trick to Hallendale is there in the area

[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.280]
There are new bars, but there is unincorporated section great

[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.120]
Well, that's probably where he wants to go

[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.420]
That's where sunny ought to be in politics in unincorporated places

[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.780]
Supposedly tomorrow afternoon there's gonna be a show I think on the Alex Bennett show having to do with strip bar

[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.120]
Well, let me look at my thing here and

[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:51.220]
I don't I don't see it on my thing, but if you say so I believe it. Oh, I'll be on it. Oh, yeah

[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.340]
Great very interesting show greater. They're gonna be any topless guests. There'll be a couple

[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.360]
Excellent. Well, I know to get their live studio audience going

[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.080]
Maybe some of those people we saw in the Grove yesterday. They'll show up for them

[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.320]
He's not too pleased with the crap that they're spewing in the paper and I don't blame them

[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.860]
And I'm and I haven't said anything about it. Well not too much

[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:20.420]
But it's bush league, you know, I mean they don't have to tip their hat to anybody else whatever they're doing their own business and

[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.780]
You know, they don't have anything to one Carlos co-tex

[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:28.080]
They don't have to give him a bunch of you just he's there and however long he's there they should kiss the ground

[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.440]
That's all he's a lot of class

[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.340]
He has a lot of class for the station

[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:37.440]
Yeah, at that time of the night you bet and if they leave men air for a couple of months there'd be a real number

[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.460]
You know, I mean they may be I used to do tens and elevens at night

[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:46.020]
But these people are Johnny come lately's in this market. They don't realize the virgin territory that there is there a night

[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:50.020]
Because all the other stations are running all his network and tape crap that nobody wants to listen to

[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:57.380]
Well, I used to be at this jockey for 15 years on and off and the only thing I heard about major show

[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.740]
Which I don't like too much was that air

[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:06.840]
Some better in the show. Yeah, well, maybe he'll work in WJR and Detroit, sir. They liked it here there

[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:13.520]
Have a great day. Okay. Good luck to you. Okay. They're all experts everybody knows this business inside and out if they're so smart

[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.880]
How come they're not in management, right?

[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:21.120]
Well, maybe that's a rhetorical question maybe because they know something let's go to Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.760]
Yeah, hi Neil. Hi, listen

[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:28.080]
I call because the guy you had in your first half hour the one who was talking about these numbers in New York

[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:36.460]
Yeah, that's the guy that had the 11 12,000 raised in the condominium in the bank account. No that guy had a low voice

[00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.900]
No, that was not the same guy

[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:45.960]
No, because he that was one of the talks about the conspiracy between leaf Fowler. Yeah, no, that was not the same guy

[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:52.320]
Oh, that guy had a real old low voice this guy had a higher voice. No, he well, maybe he was throwing his voice

[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.400]
No, I thought it was low, too, but anyway, well, I don't know how low how low can he go, sir?

[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:02.560]
He always a pretty low. He always has insight information about games. Well, I know what we know what the number was the number was the two

[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.880]
eight and he said no, now it's going lower and that's what I became a little Larry because there's no the trends are gonna be out in any market for another

[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.760]
10 days or so, so I don't know what he's talking about exactly, but you know

[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.040]
Also that's stock well. Is that the stock well the guy you from Christine?

[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.900]
John stock well, he was in top gun. Was he?

[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:25.800]
He's in the first the beginning. He's the pilot that washes out which enables Tom Cruz to go to the Tom

[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.340]
Well, isn't that nice how come we couldn't have gotten Tom Cruz to wash out?

[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.600]
God, maybe John will show up in my next remote. Yeah, that's a good question. Hmm anyway

[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.140]
Enjoy your show. Thank you, sir. Okay. Well, he could be right that could have been the guy

[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.540]
He kept saying to me now is this a client call is this a client call? He kept saying to me now is this a client call?

[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.440]
Is this a client call or he was concerned?

[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.200]
Or he was

[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.440]
He kept saying to me now is this a client call? Is this a client call?

[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.140]
1131 at W.I.O.D.

[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:57.420]
We have an open line in Broward at 524 Crank 524 W.I.O.D.

[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:05.000]
Wilton matters is gone well up yours. Okay. I hope that the whole city of Wilton matters just like fades off the map into the ocean

[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.520]
We have an opening in day two and Broward. What the hell just happened there man?

[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.380]
Did we do something evil and wrong? Did we offend the audience?

[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.900]
Don't forget Alex Bennett speaking of that Tommy smothers on the phone comic key

[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:21.580]
Barani or Barani and that live studio audience and in tomorrow boy

[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.440]
He's gonna have some nude women with enormous

[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.460]
Things I guarantee you he'll have an audience tomorrow, huh Friday

[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.780]
Well, he'll say it's because of the end of the week

[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:37.060]
But we know where his audience is coming from. Okay. They want a lot of those our donut people in here with the gigantic breasts

[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:41.560]
And that's where it's at. That's what the Alex Bennett shows all about his big boobs my Emmy

[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:46.040]
Yeah, yeah, what's up? Are you doing pal? All right. What's happening dude?

[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:52.000]
I'm sick. How the hang in you're sick. Yeah another one boy my phone can make you to the bathroom

[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.320]
I'll be in my position. Okay

[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.800]
Listen, you got to do something about being being the afternoon about what boring Bennett

[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:05.280]
Well, you stop it stop it see then he accuses me then he turns around accuses me of ripping him

[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.160]
I've been pretty damn nice to him to be honest with you. Yeah, but he's terrible

[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.080]
I was trying to pump him up yesterday at that crowd at the remote and I mentioned his name and they were all hissing and booing

[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.660]
They have a little boo-doo dolls. Well, it's because nobody gives anybody a chance in this market

[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:21.800]
Well, give him another week or two and you'll really hate him like poison you pretty weak. Why do you say that?

[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.120]
Let's let's get specific

[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:29.120]
I mean any you can call up any show and you can say Joe Smith. He's he's weak. Well, what what does that mean?

[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.840]
Doesn't know anything about this market. Well, he's only been here a week and a half

[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.460]
And he brings all these people in from

[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.520]
It's I don't know. I don't like it

[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.920]
But you can't give me a good reason though. I mean the fact he doesn't know anything about the market

[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:49.600]
That's because Nick is giving him all the information and Nick of course is you know try to sabotage the show because Steve is giving him orders

[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.860]
It's just that when you lighten up. He got that surly look on his face

[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:58.420]
Just relax. Well, yeah, at least I can do is get even for that stiff guy you brought in from the new times this morning

[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.940]
Now Nick's getting surly and uptight look at a give me a look that could kill any finally started grinning

[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.740]
Because he knows that business has been good this week. He's just moved into a two million dollar mansion in the grove by the way Nick

[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:16.960]
Sir, yeah, are you following that? Yeah, goes to show you if you keep two jobs at the same time it really pays off

[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.720]
What's on the bail over he said business is tremendous?

[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.420]
That's it. I it's moving fire report. What what's fire report?

[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.220]
Hold on one second W I O D

[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.620]
Can I speak to me? Oh sure hold on is this you? Yeah, okay?

[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:36.160]
Okay, I just get nervous when I see those lines flash cuz Melvin's doing a whole he's looking for another job

[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.940]
Oh, he's sitting you heard that woman. She said he's about to bail out good

[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:48.780]
Maybe he could fly the W.O.D. traffic copter we could let him bail out. Yeah, right over Biscayne Bay with clearance hold on W.O.D

[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:55.200]
Okay, that was just a line checker go ahead all right Alex will have a strippers panel and a surprise guest on Friday

[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.060]
It says on my screen. Okay, so that guy had good information

[00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.800]
Hopefully you have to try to listen

[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.100]
Yeah, you're wicked your brutal you don't let up for a second. Why don't you give the guy a chance?

[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.460]
Wouldn't you like to come in and see the strippers tomorrow? No, no thank you. Why not?

[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.360]
I'm not that tight. Oh God. You're one of those

[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.440]
Yeah, they all right. Well, you should have been in a grove yesterday

[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:20.820]

[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.280]
I'll do anything to get him off the air

[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.500]
What is he's not going off the air? He's got a contract for six weeks. Wow

Yeah, yeah, he's investigating the Kennedy assassination route again. He's at the grassy knoll

[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.600]
That's what I thought I

[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.400]
See a little if you see in fact that answers the question

[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.720]
You know everybody wonders what that puff of smoke was on the grassy knoll stand was there with a Stogie

[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:17.460]
You bet and the Stogie too. I got a quick spider fort for you. Okay. You got a guy in there in your newsroom

[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.560]

Okay, honey box. He's doing very well in Dallas. It's 1142

[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:47.000]
Well, that's because they can't understand what he's saying if they could ever understand it where he said they kick his ass out of town on a rail

[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:53.340]
Uh, let's answer Dave shall we W I O D. Hey, how you doing today? Okay. That was quick. Who's this?

[00:25:54.200 --> 00:26:00.920]
This is this. This is this is this is Neil. I know that well. I didn't know it was Bruce. Well, how you do you have an advantage?

[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:06.660]
You know who's on this end? This is true. See their Melvin or me. Hey, I'm calling from the down south. I don't get the boy Gary

[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.360]
I don't get the central you read could you read the article?

[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:15.600]
Okay, are you ready? I'm just reading the part that pertains to Mr. Ferrell and Mr. Majors that was irrelevant

[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:23.040]
You want to hear it? Yes, sir. Big Ferrell who was hired by radio station W I O D is a stop gap evening host between baseball seasons

[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:29.320]
Didn't even make it to spring training embarrassingly low ratings in the fall arbitrage book brought about his premature departure

[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.800]
He was replaced by stand major effective last Tuesday night

[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:38.360]
The fall ratings book indicated the W I O D audience was overwhelmingly rejecting the strident right-winger

[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.880]
Who previously had been fired by W JNO in the Palm Beach market

[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:46.960]
Among the unconventional positions that might have turned off the audience was Ferrell's declaration that Americans have a

[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.840]
Constitutional right to own any weapon

[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.800]
But do not have a right to privacy

[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:55.960]
Ferrell inherited a 3.5 audience share from sports talk at 8 p.m. But by the 9 to 10 hour

[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.220]
W I O D's ratings plummeted to 0.9

[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:04.420]
W I O D general mangler Mike Disney said a fractional rating is unheard of at W I O D

[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.640]
We have more people than that listening at five o'clock in the morning. He said

[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:12.700]
Ferrell share improved to a two one in his final hour, which is still miniscule by W I O D standards

[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:17.920]
But as soon as he left the air W I O D skyrocketed to a 7 at 11 p.m. for Larry King

[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.380]
Disney said the station would have made the change as soon as the ratings book was released

[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.100]
But was unable to because major who until two weeks ago was W I O D's after no

[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:32.440]
Personality was originally reluctant to take over the 8 to 11 p.m. ship as soon as major agreed to the new assignment

[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:37.640]
W I O D made the change W I O D still plans to broadcast Yankees baseball games this season

[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:43.260]
But major will fill the gaps on evenings when there are no games as well as serve as the station swing host during vacation and sick leaves period

[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.180]
That's good end of quote end of quote. That's that's excellent. Yeah

[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.460]
He deserves it though. Who?

[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.280]
Stan yes, and he deserves a little bit more support

[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:56.100]
But they don't know how to do that here. They like to keep everybody on the rope, you know

[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:56.460]
So

[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.960]
Was has levied in back to the center to get like his last day? I don't know

[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.440]
He's certainly gonna come in here and to give his regards. I'll tell you that

[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.080]
If you still well, I guess you have no idea if you're still running from Steve

[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.920]
Well, that's that's pretty good now. Now he has to leave now Steve can get his condom when he comes back

[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.320]
Yeah, there you go. Steve Elise will have a place to live

[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.220]
I don't even know if he ever rented his house out

[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.860]
Well, didn't he rent some condo and with some old

[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.020]
geriatric some old geriatric place there in

[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:26.800]
Margarita yeah, but he's also got the house that I was gonna read out and I changed my mind because I don't want to do business with Steve and

[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:31.320]
The timing wasn't right either and so he may have a couple of vacancies there

[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.900]
So he may you know have a lot of space to come back to when he bombs in New York

[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:39.260]
That's that's that's good. That's good cinema. Okay. Good day. So yeah, it's 11

[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:40.520]
45

[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.040]
Cruel audience man. You're awfully cruel. I'll tell you

[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:48.060]
Well, I was sitting there yesterday at specs looking around and just

[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.500]
drooling I said god there's just

[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:56.200]
I have never seen anything quite like that all in one place except maybe when I was in Amsterdam

[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.580]
I just never saw so many hot-looking people all in one spot

[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:03.340]
And I thought she any one of these people could go home with me and I'd never come back

[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.360]
Let's go to but that's the way it is speaking of that here's a call from the Grove

[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:13.060]

[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.580]
But you know it's uh

Well, that's the way it goes. I know. Don't worry about it. It was worth it though, wasn't it?

[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:46.960]
Yeah, you gave it to me the other day about some Yankee owners. That's true. Yes, sir. I heard you here ready him

[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:52.320]
Okay, we don't need him in the sport. No, he's not in good sports in harness racing and thoroughbred racing

[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:57.160]
Force came in ninth just like the Yankees did Tuesday good good. Oh, I

[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:02.700]
And he's not talking to me anyway. I see Tommy Harmer's back. How did when did he sneak into town? What's going on here?

[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.180]
I don't know I guess it's snowing in Chicago

[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:10.480]
So you had a 38 to one shot that just mislast I came in second. What the hell is going on with this guy?

[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:15.420]
I believe it and I wasn't even here for the first time. I was with Rebecca Paul from the lottery

[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.100]
And let her know

[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:23.620]
What happened of our paramutual industry? Yeah, do you tell her to keep her lottery tickets out of the track?

[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:27.900]
To by the way, well of course we didn't like it too. It's they've done too good

[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:33.020]
Three billion dollars and two years, you know, I wouldn't oh, you know what they say as suckers born every minute

[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:37.900]
Yes, the gear we got a big payoff going on here. Yeah, did I hear it? It's up to 20

But we gave out $5,000. Don't you think I do your spot challenge?

[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.800]
Do you think I'm living in a vacuum? You are not here because you don't see my fat ugly face that I don't know

And in honor of Tom jik is column and we also had a call just before these last two and sipping calls

[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.800]
In your column. I have no problem with my credibility neither of my readers

[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:36.320]
Well, that was pretty weak. Let's see who's around for them. Let's see who's around the wild dick

[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:37.440]
Hahaha

[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:41.880]
That speaks for itself. Okay, that was the good cut

[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:46.840]
Let's go to a for Lauda Dale. Hello, Neil. Yeah. Got a question in the comments. Yes, sir

[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:51.460]
I'm reading this paper here. I'm not at the same page you were about the Farrell Inn major out or

[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.680]
Yeah, you read down a little bit

[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:58.180]
The cubs are gonna be broadcast on channel 34. Yeah, but that's in four piers

[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.020]
Well, that's great if you're sitting under the tower

[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.000]
Yeah, or if the wind's blowing just right

[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.120]
well i you know the sun sentinel panders to a pomegranate cowty so much and i

[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.280]
guess if you're way up in uh... pomegranate cowty can pick up thirty four but

[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.960]
down here we don't even know what the hell it is

[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.340]
that's great even if you got a satellite

[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:17.200]
but it also says that uh... thirty nine still might do some weeknight came

[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:17.820]
might

[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:21.820]
might be it could be it ain't it ain't

[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:22.960]
yeah goal-being hell

[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.660]
i know

[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.540]
the question

[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.640]
i got uh... somehow accidentally roped into being on all of the studio

[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.100]
audience

[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:29.560]
great

[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.080]
now uh...

[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.300]
that you got any tips there's any warning that i should have before i go in

[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.140]
or well once it can be tomorrow i were lose clothing tomorrow

[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.660]
well no that's not uh... next to you

[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:40.520]
on next Tuesday

[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.120]
well uh... in that case where some tight clothing okay

[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.780]
i don't know what to tell you i mean the audience in the early part of the

[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.940]
week you'd like four five it's pretty grim

[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.960]
well i tried to get in the moral but of course that's impossible don't you think

[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.780]
that if he's going to do a live studio audience wouldn't be better if they took

[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.720]
and again i'm trying to program his show

[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:02.340]
but like yesterday it's best we had hundreds of hundreds of people i mean all

[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.880]
together we had a tremendous turnout

[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.800]
wouldn't be more fun if they took it out in the rover they could get like a

[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.060]
whole bunch of people in the studio audience could react

[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.980]
for real instead like five or six people making a barnyard sounds

[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.600]
yeah i would probably better how big is the studio how many people small

[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.680]
small it could it's mexican hold about a dozen people in here very

[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.280]
were very like a ventilated clothing okay

[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.600]

for us i could watch it at the track but that would be

[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.940]
that would be a good idea

[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:31.060]

[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:31.760]

[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:54.980]
billberts

[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:56.080]
i have to take a home

[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.540]
yeah well giberts okay okay and small doses

[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.960]
yeah i think he got a little bit too hurt

[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.260]
that's a good time

[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.760]
i can't hear you at all are you on some kind of a two-bit phone

[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.640]
and you know

[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.480]
just not not real good

[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.180]
okay that better

[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:14.740]

[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:15.240]
yeah

[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.700]
scream into that little thing it helps

[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:22.220]
now probably a

[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.740]
so anyway yes

[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.520]
it was a lot of fun yesterday

[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.800]
i thought so

[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:29.620]
but i guess i was wrong

[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.940]
well i don't know the audience today seems like they got a whole different

[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.380]
agenda this is not this is not the logical

[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.780]
follow-up to yesterday's remote

[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.980]
but then in this town nothing is never ever a logical follow-up at all it all

[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:46.380]
went down the toilet when the guy from newtimes was here today thanks to him

[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:46.800]
and nick

[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.160]
and it will be recovered from that

[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:49.800]
now

[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.420]
we have to watch out for those people

[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:52.800]
yeah

[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.200]
problem makers professional problem makers going to write the sensational

[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.740]
story the real story

[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.160]
behind the firing of the bird through a bird's eyes

[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.560]
a bird's eye view

[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.020]
which one the new one you got a new one now

[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.540]
a new one

[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:09.840]
we do

[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:14.920]
no billberts not going to be the bird we don't want to have learned you don't

[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.680]
let these people overdo it okay

[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.980]
because then they just they're like a whirling dervish to get out of control

[00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:22.920]
and they're all over the place and then they stop being funny and there's no

[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:23.800]
novelty anymore

[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.760]
and it just wears out real quick believe me

[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.860]
never never spoil a good thing

[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:30.380]
right

[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.020]
well anyway i have to go

[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.040]

[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:43.620]

[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:44.340]
now that he is

[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.060]
when

[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.460]

[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:09.980]

that uh...

[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:15.360]
sir it's a satire it's at thier sir in almost all satire is based on stereotypes

[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.480]
and it's a joke and it's humor and it's her fun lighten up a little bit

[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.220]

[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:54.400]
Steve Kane only because of course we all like to

[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:57.380]
hey listen Steve and i got along okay well he was here

[00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:59.800]
i mean you as Steve's only problem when he was here he was stubborn

[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.860]
he kept putting the same boring guest on but Steve did okay here

[00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:05.260]
but he did like you know hey we all like to at least i do

[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:07.760]
well i'll be honest with you i'll be honest with you when Steve was here

[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:10.380]
though man the audience hated him like poison so i don't know why all of us

[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:13.740]
no i always like that so listen to me that's a problem with the audience here

[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:18.440]
if we put on a all of a sudden you like b if we fire a and we put on b

[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:23.140]
then you want c then if we fire b and we put on c then you want a back if you know

[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.940]
well that's what people say they didn't like him the fact of the matter is

[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:29.560]
everybody likes the spatialism that's what they buy the quarry that's what they watch for

[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:31.140]
yeah but let me let me let me face the deep

[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:34.840]
he was entertaining your and your lady was not sensational after the 20th cup

[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:38.220]
you know what i'm saying yeah but you're good this guy me is probably a great guy

[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:41.220]
but he's just very well i don't see how you make him such a supposedly

[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:44.320]
hip-town like this girl such a what hip-town like

[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:47.280]
sands and this girl what makes you think san francisco is a hip-town because there's a

[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.500]
lot of queens there is that what makes you think it's all what it is

[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:53.420]
all day your playing with words no seriously why do you think it's such a hip-town

[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:56.920]
well i'm California no i think it's a lot of the s i just think supposedly

[00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:01.100]
like Los Angeles is that a hip-town Los Angeles is a nightmare it's like the end of the world

[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:04.580]
now it used to be pretty nice trying to say those you got a lot of people that you know

[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:11.200]
feel hey where to get you know quick witty and this guy i don't see how he made it

[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:15.020]
well i think you ought to give him a chance i think you ought to get on your

[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:16.600]
okay

[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.020]
god they're brutal they are and don't blame me i mean what the hell do you want me to

[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:24.360]
you want me to hang up on all these callers is that what you want they are hostile

[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:29.100]
and i i don't get it i don't get it because i got news for you no matter what it is

[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:33.360]
and like i said before i said it in a hurry i want to lay this out and i want you

[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:37.440]
to think about it and absorb it including the people in management who you know

[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.000]
they absorb like a wooden sponge they absorb nothing

[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:46.620]
but the fact of the matter is that radio for the most part like television is

[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:50.800]
become more like television people are into programs not actually if you're programming a

[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:54.860]
station you'd like to put on a half a dozen people during the day and have them be

[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:55.420]
as

[00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:00.480]
likable in other words have them be as successful as possible so that the audience

[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:04.400]
you don't get a lot of tune out okay that's that's the goal to keep people tuned in

[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:10.140]
locked in but the fact is that the best way to do that is to have people who each

[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:15.740]
bring their own specific audience i'm telling you that i i don't care what any of

[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:20.560]
you tell me can and i did not have a big crossover i just tell you that and i

[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:24.280]
don't think rena and i got any big crossover either i could be wrong but i don't

[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:27.380]
think so and then of course they get the arbitrage and they show all the the

[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:30.700]
hour that people tune out and when they tune in all this other i i'm sorry

[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:34.720]
you're never going to convince me of that i think that each personality basically

[00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:39.520]
develops his own audience and it's just like the thing with Bill Carter i'm Q.A.M.

[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:42.780]
Bill's a good friend of mine i've talked about him i give him more publicity than his

[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:46.640]
own station because there are a bunch of geeks over there but the bottom line is

[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:51.660]
yeah he's got some of my listeners who tune him in but he has basically got his own

[00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:55.260]
audience people like what he does he's got a lot of people that hate my guts and that doesn't

[00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:59.220]
bother me because they're it's not supposed to be everything is a spin off of the

[00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:03.980]
new roger's audience that's a bunch of crap i don't i resent that i don't like it

[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:08.520]
because i think it's a fallacy to begin with people who like this show listen to

[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.100]
it and there's some people that hate this show listen to it because it feels

[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:16.060]
avoid in their lives but but generally speaking people like this show whether they like

[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:19.260]
me personally or not is not relevant but they like this show they listen to it people

[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:22.520]
like renaurion that are used to him and comfortable with him and like to wake up with

[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:26.640]
him in the morning and like his dry humor and like the different stick they listen to

[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:31.560]
us in the morning okay and that's it shows radio shows people who listen to stand

[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:35.440]
i am telling you and i know he doesn't believe this but i believe this with all my

[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:39.380]
heart i don't think there are that many new rogers people who are stand major

[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:43.740]
listeners i really don't and the fact of the matter is that when i was on zeta

[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:50.140]
in the morning different time period different frequency different band even

[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:54.060]
and stand was on in the afternoon i mean around two separate stations and he was

[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:57.340]
still doing fine and i don't think that was mostly the neo-roger's audience that

[00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:00.880]
was the stand major audience and that's how this business works and yet the

[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:03.820]
people in programming and a lot of you people out there don't understand that and

[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:07.500]
i just i just think that's the way it is you have to develop your own thing and

[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:11.120]
you can't just suck along on somebody else's co-tails it doesn't work it doesn't

[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:15.880]
happen because we're all different if we all did the same thing all day long then

[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:18.960]
it would be a different story and by by this time of the day it would be so

[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:22.980]
tired of it you bust the radio and have never tune it on again it would be old

[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:30.800]
right right okay that's what i like is agreeable colors in dear field

[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:36.180]
i don't care it says dear field on my screen so consider yourself in dear

[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:27.220]
I'm not going to say he was bad because I thought he was a panic I thought we had a great time

[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:31.960]
with him isn't it funny all those sucklings calling it on callershow this morning he put Gilbert on

[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:36.580]
for I don't know how long as I only heard part of it and everybody that called in had been listening

[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:40.580]
yesterday or some of them were even at the remote and they all loved it well I mean he said the same

[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:45.020]
and now on my show where we had him on it's like wow he sucked the way it was boring

[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:51.980]
he saying take me out to the ball game what 30 times three times how many three oh come on three

[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:58.060]
I listen for two hours I heard it over three times that's all he did it all right well my question

[01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:01.460]
I'm going over to the Bahamas what is your question you've been on here for the longest

[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:06.280]
ponderous times here what is it am I a good caller I mean well I don't know even I'm so long I

[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:10.480]
forgot we'll see I've been listening okay today you've had two people call that they just

[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:14.400]
started listening a week ago well thank god for that that's because of that heavy duty promotion

[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:18.540]
from WIOD in our promotion department well no actually the one thing I can't complain about our

[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:22.040]
promotion because we don't get any well no the other good one guy called he had a good call he

[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:27.000]
was on for about 50 minutes he was a good caller but 15 minutes yeah the one guy he called you

[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.580]
are telling you he had only been listening for about nine days yeah well he was not 15 minutes

[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:35.480]
so you're you've been on 15 minutes but not him you've been on a half hour he was a good call all

[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:39.100]
right in other words you're going to tell me who is good as a guest who's good as a call you can

[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:45.660]
be like the choreographer of the show anyone no okay it's my really what I'm in closing in closing

[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:51.200]
I'm going over to the Bahamas yeah good I might not come back I hope you make a fortune okay but

[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:55.960]
where do you stay when you go over there where I don't go over there I despise the Bahamas

[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:59.940]

thinking about going into radio yeah yeah he said that if he drives a Ferrari he must make good money

[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:19.180]
yeah so you're just sure you make good money so what does that mean I make a lot of money

[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:22.280]
