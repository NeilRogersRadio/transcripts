oh yeah that's in the opera

[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.700]

[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.520]
vocals on here

[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.040]
it isn't possible

[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.920]
that they've left off on the soundtrack where he's singing the song and

[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.080]

i was very upset reading those stupid uh... soot intellectual reviews in a paper

[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.420]
yesterday your end stuff and they give their top ten lists and we got number nine

[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.480]
or ten or something good fellows i'm sorry like i said it was a very good movie

[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.360]
but it is it's not even the same league with any of the three godfather so i don't

[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.280]
uh... i don't know what the hell it's all about don't let them get on to the

[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.460]
you know top ten this tell me somebody already got under the skin of the kid in good

[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.880]
fellows i'll tell you that one man he got more zits in about five seconds no not Tommy

[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.860]
so that uh... whatever his name with Jimmy yeah the techie guy yeah

[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.660]
and listen no he got it also what

[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:55.100]
what about the zits that this guy had up get with it wake up and get the flowers

[00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:00.840]
picture i got out on that yearbook uh... nil did you see family Smith on the sidelines of the

[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.640]
fsu uh... pens they came no i didn't i didn't watch the game

[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.320]
he was running up and down the sidelines it would jump on top of boudon it was it

[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.000]
but he did run pretty good did i think he ran for hundred yards at the end

[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.600]
uh... he's not a game is great on the sidelines

[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.140]
i have to laugh at these people they made a player the game to give the game ball

[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.840]
and he's talking did you hear him on our sports this morning when i'm driving in i just

[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.180]
i quite a mess that is showing a lot of larias about uh... oh you know anybody says

[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.680]
he's not a good player you don't know what they're talking about and he thinks he's

[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.320]
pathetic you know i was watching the uh... Atlanta

[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.040]
a Dallas game the other day

[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.740]
and boy i'll tell you that micro seer did he and you know if you're gonna try to tell me

[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.660]
Atlanta's got a great offensive line and that's why he runs like that there's no way they think

[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:53.120]
that Falcons are pathetic everybody knows that and that guy was incredible yesterday

[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.480]
micro zero i mean almost every team in the league has got a tremendous breakaway

[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.580]
powerful runner who just uh... almost unstoppable like christian a quay by the way for

[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.800]
a Kansas city that we're gonna have to stop on Saturday tremendous runner

[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.700]
and sammy you know he has a couple of good games against some really craft defenses

[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.560]
the crappy teams and right away that's supposed to make up for all the rest i don't

[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.460]
want to sound like i'm uh... wine and cuz we had a great year but he stinks

[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.520]
but by the way in the herald today they have the greatest

[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.280]
or i'm dolphin with the silver anniversary team

[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.540]
oh sammy must be on that uh... he doesn't fall in there

[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.760]
oh what's the price?

[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.860]
most of marz pony nayson and jim kick make it in running back

[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.120]
uh... and you get zonka nodding ham and boulos at fullback

[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.400]
but we still have never in the history of the franchise they have never had

[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.880]
are really great running back and you know zonka's in a hall of fame and all of

[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.060]
that but he was a you know the way he used to run three yards in a cloud of dust

[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.380]
and carry people on his back but he wasn't a

[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.920]
he wasn't a classic

[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.780]
fullback type runner like a jim brown or a water paton or a gale sares or

[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.400]
uh... very standards any of these people you know he was just a bowl

[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.540]
what's the same world of paton

[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.220]
no wonder patons another one

[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.680]
anyway we should have been here and uh...

[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.560]
okay by thanks a lot

[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.740]
leeway kelly we can go on forever

[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.640]
anyway ten thirty six at w i d we have one open line and day one and brown one on

[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.080]
the starline where fumbling our way along it's going to be a pretty a

[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.880]
gruesome day we don't care we're ready for we can handle anything

[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.260]
i heard she made a canola could be wrong

[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.360]
ten forty one at w.i.o.d my amy beach

[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.160]
yes

[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.380]
yes sir

[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.460]
yes i'd like to clarify something if you would for me please sir

[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.160]
i know that the

[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.500]
dolphins have the home for advantage against cancer city right

[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.540]
the home field advantage yeah

[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:28.660]
okay now if we win that game there's no way that we can have the home field advantage

[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.880]
a second game is right

[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.480]
no way right

[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.740]
no because the buffalo

[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:34.680]
buffalo

[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.700]
and it just that somebody told me that they know no chance buffalo and the radars

[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.500]
have got the home field advantage for the second game

[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.140]
because they drew by an average ground

[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.840]
right they have better word one and one they have equal one and also i can put that with the vision

[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.240]
jaykin

[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.720]
well thank you very much you bet

[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:55.520]
anyway all i know that isn't correct is it that's not now how come fat rich had

[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.240]
two now i'm confused because he had tickets for two games

[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:01.660]
ten

[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:02.680]
ten

[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.880]
that now confused i'm totally lost

[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.980]
well i see some other words like if we wind up playing

[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.640]
anybody other than

[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.000]
buffalo or the radars in a conference championship came and if he conference

[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.840]
championship came that would be the game that he's got the other ticket for right that would be the other home game

[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.100]
because we'd have the better record

[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.520]
am i right?

[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:26.660]
who knows

[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.780]
anyway let's take him one at a time we have an open line indeed seven five one one and

[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.120]
brown or five two four let's go to Jupiter

[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.480]
hello Neil

[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.340]
yes sir

[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:36.820]
how you doing?

[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:37.340]
great

[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:42.160]
hey on that song on that sound track that you have a movie don't want to give the name to

[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:42.520]
yeah

[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.220]
i was i just got back from Pittsburgh and i was driving through north carolina got a newspaper

[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.320]
and they were talking that

[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.720]
from the movie that Francis Ford had shown to the previewers and stuff

[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.120]
yeah

[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.460]
they really bond his daughter

[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.680]
so he went and reedited

[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.280]
and cut out all the parts where we mainly just her

[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.360]
her part was smaller than is initially intended

[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.500]
thank god for that

[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.160]
yeah really

[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:07.500]
really

[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.960]
but so that could be where that song came from

[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.820]
and also that song

[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.620]
what do i don't understand what does the song got to do with her part

[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.760]
always just to probably the background to one of her scenes

[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.880]
oh i see

[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.440]
no i'm looking for the song where

[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.220]
or where her song pulls out the guitar

[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.240]
right exactly that's one of the most poignant parts in a whole movie and he's singing

[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.360]
in it in italian

[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:29.740]
yeah

[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:34.880]
the godfather theme and he's sticking back to apalonia and his earlier days in Sicily

[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.080]
and when he was hiding and all

[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.480]
that that's one of the highlights in movie it is not on the soundtrack so

[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.140]
so far the soundtrack i give no stars i mean it's really a piece of crap

[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.440]
i thought it was a good movie i mean i like when they had the opera and they were playing

[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.700]
out the scenes of the opera and then they were doing all their

[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.820]
listen i'm as tired of all these critics and all these experts and all these mavens

[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.060]
and these pseudo intellectuals

[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.820]
i know a good movie when i see one

[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.520]
in fact there was another list of the worst movies yesterday

[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.740]
and they had my blue heaven in there

[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.020]
now i'm gonna touch did you see it

[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:03.800]
uh... yeah

[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.760]
with steve martin

[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.260]
i thought when you started talking about it

[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.160]
then you thought it was bad

[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.280]
i thought it was pretty good

[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.520]
i thought it was outstanding

[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.820]
it was too long i'll grant the last half hour drag

[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.060]
and it said idiotic

[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.640]
well eh... who name a movie that steve martin was ever in that isn't idiotic

[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.460]
but it was funny as hell i thought it was great

[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.160]
and she listed in the sunset on one of the ten worst movies of the year yesterday

[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.480]
these people out of the shot they had to line them all up and shoot them

[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.460]
and let people go out and make their own choices

[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.760]
instead of listening to all these experts

[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.080]
i said that's it i don't worry about the experts

[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.260]
i mean in this town what they think funny is Dave Barry is funny

[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.980]
as i was on yesterday morning what a way to wake up on a sunny morning

[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.700]
my call putty has got Carl Hyerson who's a great writer but a boring guest

[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.340]
and Dave Barry who the only thing he ever said

[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.900]
the funny in his life was

[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.200]
where is Larry King's check?

[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.600]
i mean the game had his not funny

[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:50.920]
he's pathetic

[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.380]
well this is also a time of think family's mess is a great way to go

[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:59.400]
exactly well just read Dave Joseph's column on the sunset this morning about the fans at the game that should tell you

[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.800]
everything you need to know about this town

[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.880]
have a great new year

[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.420]
like that school teacher

[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.320]
that's another reason i didn't go yesterday

[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.100]
all i need to do is see that school teacher

[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.500]
see it's one thing to be enthusiastic

[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.700]
but be enthusiastic at the right time

[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:14.580]
not just bouncing

[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.120]
and another thing you know the wave went out with high button shoes

[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.020]
okay the only place they still do the wave is in Atlanta

[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.120]
and the only reason they do it there is because the braves are so bad

[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.400]
that at least it gives them something to do and they ignore the game

[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.280]
okay all of a sudden Miami found the wave

[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.080]
forget it

[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.680]
and even when the place starts again

[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.080]
they're still doing the wave and the aromas are all up in front of your face

[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.100]
you're trying to see the play

[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.960]
i mean grow up already

[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.540]
whatever they said about the fans at the dolphin games

[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:44.160]
absolutely right man there's there's a few thousand of them who know football

[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.100]
who are there to enjoy the game and get excited at the right moments

[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.020]
and root for the team

[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.060]
and arrest them and they don't know what the hell are stories

[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.120]
they're just there in la la land

[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.980]
i'll never understand what

[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.200]
and especially when it cost that much money

[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.920]
to go there and just wander around

[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.360]
and the kids are running back and forth

[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.220]
and the parents are schlepping back and forth

[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.340]
and back to the concession stand

[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:08.200]
not at half time or not at times when it would be appropriate

[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.460]
but like it can be the most exciting part of the game

[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.380]
and they're getting up and running in front of you

[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.640]
up and down the aisle and off to who knows where

[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.560]
i don't understand people at all

[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.940]
it's like a social gathering place

[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.820]
instead of going because you're into the sport

[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.120]
into the team and you want to see a great game

[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.680]
or not as a case may be

[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.220]
the weather sure is nice in it

[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.720]
what a day today huh it's going to be 83

[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.400]
84 maybe even higher

[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:35.740]
paradise

[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.460]
we need neutron bombs in his town

[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.120]
get rid of the people leave the buildings

[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.900]
and leave the palm trees and the weather

[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.180]
and the gators and all his other crap

[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.200]
not the gators that was the wrong choice of words

[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.920]
1047 at w-i-o-d

[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.540]
and how to take that Joe Paturno

[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.340]
you slime ball

[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.780]
i'm so sick of Joe Paturno

[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.180]
man am i sick of him

[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.100]
thank god they got beat

[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.400]
and they got a bunch of sissy uniforms

[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.400]
anyway Penn State don't they they're pathetic

[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.800]
they look like a high school team

[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.660]
even piper high could beat them

[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.900]
wobel and poor lauderdale

[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.860]
how you doing good how are you

[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:08.820]
i'm doing great

[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.340]
if you i got a pretty much a breakdown of the playoffs

[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.660]
if you want me to tell you how my amic can have two home games

[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.560]
okay the only way it can happen

[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.800]
which is possible is for you

[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.140]
then to make it to the AFC championship against my amic

[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.980]
right because we have a better record

[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.880]
well because they're a wildcard team

[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.220]
well we're a wildcard team too

[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.020]
right with with a better record

[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.320]
but we also have a much better record than the bangles

[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.740]
but they're a division winner

[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.860]
so even if the bangles

[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.500]
if the bangles make it

[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:41.680]
you know but the only way it happens is if you've been beat since an adi

[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.220]
and my amy beats Kansas City

[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.980]
what happens is my amy goes to Buffalo

[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.840]
and uh... you can go to Los Angeles

[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.060]
so the only way it's going to happen is if my amy

[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.900]
my amy all have to go to Buffalo

[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.840]
and beat Buffalo

[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.080]
which is not going to happen

[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:57.780]
pretty remote

[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.080]
well who knows i'd love to see it happen but uh...

[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.840]

[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.960]
i couldn't believe it

[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.880]
and i'll tell you who else played a damn good game

[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.140]

[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.220]

[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.720]

[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.200]
give them a battle royal yesterday

[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.340]
i'll tell you i was really rooting against the raiders

[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.500]
i wasn't

[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.900]
it would have brought the raiders here

[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.500]
well who the hell wants that

[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.280]
who the hell wants that

[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.020]
i'd rather play a team that's got a quarterback

[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.020]
who's got pins in his hand who can't even uh...

[00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.240]
did you see that game where they kicked the crap out of the bears on Saturday

[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.460]
did you see his hand on the ball

[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.860]
and he kept handing off the ball and every time he had off the ball

[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:08.660]
or running back with smack the ball and it was hand as he was taking away and he'd be stay there just holding his hand

[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.120]
and screaming and pain

[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.840]
it was incredible you know

[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.300]
i was at my folks house and i was watching the game with my mother

[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.280]
and she was like couldn't watch

[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.360]
and when they showed the picture of his hand on tv

[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.320]
with the pins coming out the side

[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.880]
and it looked like it looked like it where it's easier here

[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.380]
it was it it was gross man i thought i was going to puke

[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.640]
yeah but they had a rough time because he kept slicing the ball out they had to keep uh... bringing a new one in

[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:37.380]
really and boy speaking i bring a new one in mic tom zack you talk about guys who have lost it

[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:42.020]
mic tom zack is the steep blast of football he just totally has lost it

[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:46.360]
he's absolutely inept and then once in a while when he would hit the receiver they would just drop it

[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:51.740]
like in disdain as if to say hey you're so bad we're going to show you i mean if it just like uh... hold it and drop it

[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.440]
look at him like screw you mic

[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.900]
yeah but the black was a decent picture of tom zack was never a decent quarter

[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.060]
i died disagree with you when uh... what's his name when old uh... number of

[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.060]
brain there used to it mcman used to get injured all the time he came in a few

[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:09.500]
time for it for a fact one season he played pretty well yeah well he was the underdog but when he came in as

[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.440]
the starter for getting yeah he was hopeless

[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.040]

business who'll shield for anybody and anything all right believe me i said in that restaurant on

[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:41.180]
Saturday and when i started nibbling on my mung the first thing that came to mind is there is no

[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:46.080]
wave and then the sad part of it is when i walked in there we go in a restaurant and there's a guy

[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.440]
who recognized me immediately one of the six people who was in their eating or waiting to eat or

[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.440]
just lost wondering around to make it look good and he recognized me saying hey how you doing he

[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.100]
said now you're gonna love this place i ate here last week i came back again to the food is great so

[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:05.940]
i thought hey that's fabulous it was from hunger do you know what it's like to go out to a place

[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:44.080]
and think that they're a restaurant people i don't understand it that's one of the reasons that

[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:49.180]
the restaurant turnover is so great not just a tough business but every jackass in a world wants to

but it's new years of day

[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.760]
what is this herb title men in coconut creek

[00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:00.280]
from the big corporation there's a big box i wonder if this is pens

[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.800]
was it's either pens are can only

[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:08.320]
if it's pens would not be great boy pens are just everywhere you go in offices

[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.580]
radio stations in my house no matter how many pens i go out and buy

[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:15.100]
they just disappear i think the dogs are eating

[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:16.540]
or somebody

[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:23.280]
anybody would come on the air and say that the homeless are bums

[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:27.100]
and just use that as a blanket statement for his refusal

[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:31.520]
to have any interest or don't i mean i mean i don't know not everybody uh... is

[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:34.300]
interested in the same charities i understand that not everybody supports the

[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:38.680]
same causes and then to talk about stepping over the bodies during the commercial

[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.880]
break at fifty five when i left here on friday

[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.040]
and i punched over to you know who

[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:47.020]
and somebody with the same guy who was trouble making called here making trouble

[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.940]
was calling over there and i think that's basically what they're going to have

[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.460]
is all the old yenta is back in fourth over that place

[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:57.140]
and uh... start up this thing about the wife steve didn't give any money to

[00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:59.940]
comillus house and the challenge of this net and how i said he was trying to

[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:03.580]
exploit it and on the one hand he said oh well he made the challenge and he would

[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:06.780]
have forgiven the thousand and a senate now and then on the other hand he said not

[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.120]
a charity cares about he cares about kids and if it was good in other words there

[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:14.320]
are no homeless children and about how when he lived in the york used to step over

[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:18.660]
to homeless in the drug addicts and bums and winos uh... anybody would just make

[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:22.740]
that kind of a statement is such a jackass it's pathetic and i mean unless you

[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.920]
don't read anything other than the national inquirer

[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:30.360]
anybody knows that we have just thousands and thousands of homeless mothers with

[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:35.020]
little children teenagers all kinds of uh... kids which i guess is his interest

[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.900]
but the thing that i'm curious about talk about hypocrisy if you're not

[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.880]
interested in the charity to begin with why would you make a challenge to give a

[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.680]
thousand dollars that's what i don't understand

[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:49.140]

[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:49.120]
brought in the new year for w i o d and he was talking about

[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.580]
what an impact he was gonna have and how long could he last after the new year in

[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:57.400]
the old about two months six minutes six minutes that's it and then you had

[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.880]
joey randles and rady martin in the list

[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:03.460]
they the endless loop list goes on and on hopefully night

[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:07.260]
nineteen ninety one we don't have to listen to that that joey randles at a

[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:12.140]
randie martins but i sure hope ang does real great at night but it would be

[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:15.540]
uh wonderful like i said the other day if he's ever on that would help a lot

[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.620]

[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:23.200]
they just they have taken from like eight o'clock till midnight on his radio station

[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:26.060]
and they just write it off i don't know what they're all they're thinking about

[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:29.980]
they give nobody a chance in there and as much as i hope you and basketball

[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:34.080]
develops and get some support i mean a number of people listening to those games

[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:38.440]
you could put in this studio and have lots of space left over believe me i don't

[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.660]
know what these people are thinking about right i agree with you i want to

[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:45.980]
percent about that i mean how the hell is the guy going to ever make an impact if he's never on

[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:49.920]
right what's the thousand dollar challenge you were talking about with Steve came

[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.860]

[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.260]
Rick and suds put up five hundred bucks which is one of the biggest donations for

[00:46:56.260 --> 00:47:01.920]
Camilo souse was very generous of them and mr. vgo as usual has a big mouth and nothing to back it up

[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.920]

[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:10.200]
did you read the fort laurel news today i thought it was the most stupid column i have ever read in

[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:15.000]
my life you're talking about the how it ties in with the history yeah the vatican storyline as

[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.160]
really try to make it sound like oh well it's just that we all know it just make believe in the

[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:24.040]
guide the people in the church uh say it's just a fiction of course and who the hell are they

[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:30.180]
kidding exactly you know these people in the media are so terrified of organized religion that

[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:35.740]
it's really uh it's it's embarrassing just pathetic oh i'm really looking forward to see it and i

[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:41.480]
also read those uh movies that they now may for the top ten people are quite appalled all the pseudo

[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.860]
intellectuals get together and uh isn't it interesting that the ones that they like are not the

[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:50.040]
ones that the public supports most of the time exactly what i was going to say it's the public

[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:54.080]
just goes and eros it to take a box and they have they're off the wall with these things right

[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:58.940]
Edward ciz are hands and all the i haven't seen it but i'm not going to ridiculous it looks

[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:10.600]
weeks they're all busy uh making excuses or something well i'm hoping next weekend where did you go

[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:18.220]
