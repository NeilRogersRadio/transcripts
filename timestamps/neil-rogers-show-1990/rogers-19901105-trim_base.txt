[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980]
Have a couple for a Johnny Miami

[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.020]
Wait a minute did I do that wrong Miami and here comes Beach towel wiping it up. What a day Friday? Yeah

[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.120]
Thank you for the tickets you were there, huh? Yeah, I was I was here and

[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.400]
You sound pretty excited

[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.360]
Well, I started out with Calder that day Friday. Yeah, I'm free from Calder. I went to pomp and I boy here's a real degenerate

[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.820]
matter-of-fact no

[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.840]
I

[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.980]
Went specifically because the friend of mine

[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:40.080]
That was in business with a business with is very much into the horse racing and that's mainly why I tried to win the tickets to take him

[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.740]
Yeah, and he enjoyed it and

[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.300]
But I think was he bet more money than what he was winning because of the

[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.880]
short prices short prices and so close to the end of the night at pompino. He's saying boy

[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.300]
Must be a bunch of jackass is around here and I'm the biggest one who races later

[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.780]
He finally gives up handy cap and he picks his wife's numbers

[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.540]
Six three six eight box on the try yeah, and hits it and gets back a thousand bucks. Oh, geez

[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.100]
I can't handle these stories. I can't stand it

[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.500]
Here's noils missed with D Wayne minor. He's a leave and he's parked he's breaking his puke and he's dead last

[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.480]
I'm telling you D Wayne minor from the Mickey McNichol school of ineptitude just incredible pathetic

[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.640]
Which was the race that six three eight came in I think it's close to the end you're asking me how do I know I'm just lucky to still be here

[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.240]
It was the it wasn't the twelve. I don't know

[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.520]
but I

[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.600]
Used to own a horse and I used to work for sterling which has horses out in Calder

[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.100]
Yeah, and I just left to watch horses. I didn't bet much

[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.840]
Of course I I lost most of it, but when you see horses like peace core and and beach tower

[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.820]
Yeah, that's the thing on a night like breeder's crown now, you know go

[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.160]
I always people talking about betting and yeah

[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.060]
I don't want to mention a names but some of the people with us are out there like we're gonna get them rich that night

[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.420]
That isn't the night to worry about that

[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.940]
That's the night when you see these tremendous horse we had two world records two new track records

[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.780]
These people are hockin and trying to get about did I cash to perfect then is it you know the double gonna pay three twenty

[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.000]
Who cares? Yeah, you can't go to a breeder's crown there problem with this town people don't have any appreciation of anything

[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.900]
All they want to do is go out in the cash of bed right not me

[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.940]
I have a cash one and so long. I don't know where you do with the ticket the only thing I was disappointed at is the

[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.900]
Sunday when I Saturday when I look at the

[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.700]
Handle the attendant there's only 13,000 I figure 12,000 was 12,226 of my memory is correct and that's pretty pathetic

[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.480]
I know I expected everything in this town. It's the same old deal

[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.940]
You know no matter how great it is no matter how much hype and holo balloon or how exciting it is

[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.700]
They just sit on their goddamn hands. They got a million excuses. They don't they're just a bunch of dead heads in this town

[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.140]
There must have been some big one other than my Zhang and Shuffleboard and the early bird. That's all they care about

[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.180]
What was the handle million and 1,122,000 in some odd?

[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.300]
That's not bad for 12,000. Yeah, but most of that came from our table

[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.920]
That God Hank was there. Have a great day. I'm glad he had a good time. Okay, thanks for the tickets. It's also a happy birthday and

[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.480]
Oh, that part where

[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.440]
Hank Goldberg says he paid for the beer you should do that. Yes, sir

[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.840]
Let's get that off the tape George right away. Yeah, thanks a lot. Take her to you

[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.360]
Like sometimes the next month 10 past noon at W.I. O.D. We have an open line and day

[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.220]
7 5 1 I want to cash the bet 7 5 1 she gave me the wrong ticket

[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.960]
Very nice old lady probably from Halondale she comes into pompano every night probably not over the age of 200

[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.600]
And I bet a couple of two dollar doubles and then I say three dollar doubles three dollar doubles two three two seven two nine

[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.080]
right and I'm sitting at my table a three which is a lock with Leon cable winds going away in a seventh race

[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.140]
I'm sitting there. Okay. I got three horses

[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.280]
I'm alive in the double and a couple of them are going to be a pretty good price the three which was called the

[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.580]
Ralph Cramden

[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.140]
the seven with Kevin always dangerous from Michigan Wallace and the nine which was I think the favorite and

[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.060]
I get my tickets out. I throw away the losing one. I look at the other one. It's two dollar perfectas

[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.840]
Not doubles perfectas

[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.720]
two three two seven two nine well as luck would have it it would two nine perfected just came in in a first app

[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.640]
But it only pays us thick in nineteen dollars and eighty cents

[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.260]
I would like to just once go up there and put my one hand around her throat and the other one around Mickey

[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.260]
McNichols throat

[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.880]
And there'd be a lot of people standing online on the last one

[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.000]
By the way Kelly Shepherd who is not a girl mustache and always up their last night late

[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.020]
After losing a couple of more. He's over the meeting. He's over thirty five trying to keep a perfect record

[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.880]
Even bread handover never had a perfect record. Thank you very much. You're a wonderful American my car is clean again

[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.720]
Great. Thank you, sir and don't panic Spencer. You can come in our Wednesday Spencer don't get all a psychotic in the

Emotional it's 12 minutes past noon at W. I. D. And we'll be right back

[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.300]
New for 1991 is well motor's presence the

[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.400]
six two six from the moment you turn the key you know

[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.320]
Okay, let's see what this baby can do. This is one car. You can't pass over

[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:44.220]
The six two six features an onboard computer that monitors all systems including automatic shoulder restraints

[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.540]
That you're too much of a big shot to put on your seat belt. All right. I'll put it on

[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.400]
Rock and opinion steering

[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.700]
Personally, I would have taken a less, but if you want to go the long way, that's your business

[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.100]
I know what I'm doing and every MOTSA 626 comes with an AMFM stereo CD

[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:14.300]
C.D. Schmeiny better. You should get my all right. I don't need this order your MOTSA 626 this month and enter for your chance to win the world's fastest motorcycle

[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.600]
The new Yamaka 1000

[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.040]
Well, don't you miss your gun?

[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.380]
No, but you MOTSA 626 it just feels right

[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.500]
Right for you, maybe please

[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.340]
You're gonna be the death of me

[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.800]
20 is gonna get mad

[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:38.100]
1216 at W. I. O. D. We have an open line on the star line star I. O. D. Oh

I knew how you doing great. I hope you have a great 48 birthday. Thank you so much

[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.320]
Saturday I went to the hurricane game and afterwards I went to pizza left

[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:59.140]
And I like to say that they have the best pizza Miami. Yeah, we're regular customers and we have a great time

[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.860]
We're there and just always very friendly wonderful guy just brought in

[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:09.920]
tons of food he just ladled it all over the table. Here is incredible all over you two. Yeah, okay

[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.720]
My brother in a sea of eggplant

[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.480]
My brother went to the dolphin game and he'd like to ask you something

[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.620]
Neil yes, sir wasn't the game enjoyable game was great

[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.360]
I like I don't like all those tense games like the jets game

[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.880]
I like where you get about a three touchdown lead you just coast along and relax

[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.400]
And nobody gets into the game everybody was like looking at the blue angels and looking around

[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.160]
Everybody's looking at the fight on the east end. Did you notice the fight?

[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.220]
Everybody just know I didn't see that how'd I miss that? I don't know

[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.360]
It was a big fight not security cops are there and everybody just for me just turned their head away from the game

[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.860]
And we're just looking at well you do have a lot of goofballs there for example

[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:50.340]
There was one play when a game was still must have been in the second or third quarter and it was still a little touch and go

[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.300]
And they snapped the ball marinos going back to pass all of a sudden all these hands go up in front of me

[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.220]
They're doing the wave. They're still doing a while a game is going on

[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.440]
Break I can't see the scoreboard. I can't see the field I know really

[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.200]
Wow a bunch of Yahoo's here. This is such a

[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.620]
Behaving a game or something like a Yahoo town, you know, so many of these people don't they don't know a football from their butt

[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.220]
I know really and there were a lot of empty seats especially on the upper level

[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:22.240]
Mm-hmm and that it's right enough the first time I've been in that stadium and it's a great stadium the best the best

[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.840]
I'm telling you and then I do a lot of empty see

[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.000]
I don't know why people don't want to go out and see the dolphin

[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.520]
But if we were losing it's they don't want to do anything. It's not just don't take it personally

[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.860]
They don't want to do anything. They're dead heads

[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.860]
They're the walking dead the young the old and the ugly all right Neil

[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.920]
We're out of here. Good luck. I would like to say I'm gonna win those raider tickets on Wednesday

[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.540]
We're gonna be there Neil show up naked we will kneel later. Okay

[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.720]
1218 the WI would do well listen. That's one way to give it a shot, huh?

[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.460]
Let's take a mobile in Miami. Neil. Yeah, I was a hanging buddy

[00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.060]
half-mast

[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:06.140]
Listen, I got a question for you. I said to our said give me a $3 doubles the two three the two seven the two nine, okay?

[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.740]
Yeah, no problem. She gives me perfect this

[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.220]
Listen, I'm going out to California. I'm going to go up there Thursday night and

[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.020]
Straighten it all out. You're going to California with a banjo on your knee

[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.540]
Yeah, I never been there. I gave a dinner

[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.460]
Sir, I'm not one of these Yokels from

[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.620]
Kokomo, Indiana. I've been everywhere. Okay. You name it. I've been there

[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.380]
Boy, you'll feel right at home there

[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.760]
You'll feel just look around you'll see the palm trees it'll look just like sunrise lakes

[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.160]
It looked like Margate

[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:48.620]
They're all very old and drying like a prune. It'll be great. What are you going to Palm Springs?

[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.700]
I'm going to see a vetting. Oh

[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.040]
Well, that's what it'll be a vetting

[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:58.520]
What about I'm gonna be spending a couple days in our radio have any place in particular where you have a nice dinner?

[00:09:59.020 --> 00:09:59.560]
San Diego

[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:06.940]
How far is that? Don't go to LA. What do you want to go to LA for go stay away? Oh, God what a toilet

[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.200]
Go to Hollywood Park

[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.880]
I'm talking about food

[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.620]
I'm telling you LA is horrendous. I would go

[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:24.640]
Go to the brown Derby brown Derby go to I don't know find a Thai restaurant, which is anyone

[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:30.580]
I mean all you'll see is Chinese in the Thai and Oriental writing and the the handwriting is on the wall in that time

[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.660]
Let me tell you

[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.740]
Okay, well sure I give you a bicem out there. Yeah, that would be great

[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:39.060]
Probably be screaming. How do we get out of here? It's awful on the LA. I'm serious

[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:44.600]
Call you correct one of the few places you can go that'll make you homesick for here in no time at all

[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:50.640]
I thought maybe since I'll be out there I could see a team that's worse than the eat like the clippers nail or the Rams

[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.760]
All right, Neil. I'll give you a buzz. Okay. Good luck

[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:54.960]
Bye

[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:08.220]
Last week thousands of fans received their horse owners packets and joined 610 W IOD at Pompano Harness to cheer our

[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:13.540]
Club 27 at good old W IOD. We got a call from Weston

[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.500]
Oh, happy birthday. Thank you. I thought that was you center. It's a beautiful car

[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.200]
Where were you hiding in the wood? No, you're getting some bagels from off-road all store and

[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:31.580]
From John off-road all if you were to take a little walk down the shopping center you would have seen his little bagel store John off-road all has a bagel store

[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:37.580]
Nice little Jewish boy. Yeah, it's good. Yeah, all right get out it John off-road all is Jewish. No, but he's got a nice bagel store

[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.800]
Nest will be telling me Dan Marino's Jewish now the offer dollars got a bagel and Louis Oliver

[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.540]
He's got a bagel store in the same shopping center there. That's a nice shopping center

[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.640]
But I mean consider that I went for a while

[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.980]
I pulled out and I was right behind you I went over to the gas station to watch them raise their prices

[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.600]
You are flying out of there. I said that is it that's just that car is

[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:08.600]
Gorgeous color. Yeah, it's absolutely credible. That was me. I have a radio question before you go on

[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.800]
Let me let me just say one thing okay because I see all of these people and they're not just looking at the car

[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.320]
Okay, they know who I am and like a lot of these young punks and different people out there now

[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:24.920]
You know, it's one thing to smile and like I don't know what but why can't they like wave or give me a finger or do something?

[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:30.920]
You know I just people in this town are so bizarre. I just don't understand it so unfriendly

[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.420]
Wait, it took off like a bad out. No, I don't mean you I'm just talking in generally speaking like this morning

[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.860]
I was coming to work and there were some

[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:42.840]
Pinheads and I know they knew who I was and they were probably they're probably listening right now and they just they just so uptight

[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.460]
How many cars are alike that and stuff? I mean is that a real rare color?

[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.820]
Well, I haven't seen any other ones. I mean it's you see some Geos in that color

[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.500]
I haven't seen any other new vets like it yet. I can go between a geo

[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.100]
I can't geo and a vent really, but no, but I'm just pointing out the color. Oh, it's incredible

[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.220]
But if I do see another one like that, of course, I'll have to trade mine in

[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:07.920]
Is that a convertible also? No, well, say um the hard top comes off. Yeah

[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.020]
That's not the glass top

[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.700]
Comes off the top. I love the glass top because then when it's raining you just look straight up and you see little drops

[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.700]
Pitter-pattering on a top. It's great

[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.220]
Well next time you come out the East Naples you should

[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.640]
Hey, I'll tell you it's not bad out there

[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:29.280]
That's nice and quiet a lot of bugs, but it's nice and quiet, but he's got a great bagel store. It's really really good great

[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:36.300]
All little tasty little that lady in there was really nice over at Echors the one in the driver's license thing

[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.620]
You know she said it's her last year. She's gonna return next year

[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:45.300]
But they speak English. Yeah, um the radio question I had I'm this whole WNWS thing

[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:53.000]
How is it that the person that that destroyed this patient? I'm really confused as to why radio management

[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.120]
How they can keep someone like that on

[00:13:58.820 --> 00:13:59.840]
Thank you Phil

[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.440]
Because management people out present company accepted of course our assholes sir

[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.820]
That's why these Dennis Collins is still over there

[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.240]
You you put the blame even though the format was pretty dead

[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.760]
You put it on Al and Sandy shoulders wait a minute wait a minute. What is it? What do you want?

[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:22.100]
I'm doing a radio show and you're hucking a china can kveching okay? Didn't you get some nice flowers?

[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:29.440]
By the time you get back there will be more flowers. Okay, believe me. I'm doing my damnedest okay if I have to pay for them

[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.300]
Where's my what?

[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.100]
Have a nice lunch feel get her out of here. Please drag her by her feet. Go ahead. I'm sorry

[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.500]
Would you would you put the blame on that demise

[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.000]
except for the

[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.940]
The way that what's the mind what are we talking about this?

[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.740]
Have that station oh?

[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:49.740]
Of course the man destroyed now of course it's the management

[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.560]
But you understand the in radio. It's the reverse of baseball and baseball

[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:59.180]
It's the manager that always gets fired even though the player is screw up in this business the players can do a good

[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.900]
Good job and a management can screw it up, but the player still get fired

[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.780]
If I keep wandering is that you're you're constantly fighting your management

[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:11.160]
I keep wondering if the same thing would happen to you if you followed what they wanted you to do

[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.540]
How long you're so would laugh? No, she did the good part of it here is they don't know what they want anybody to do

[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.500]
They haven't got a clue okay and

[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.580]
A long ago. I kind of got them off my back and I told him if you want me here

[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.800]
Just leave me the hell alone and bug off you know just to do something useful like play with your computer

[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.520]

[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.420]
Okay, and Dennis Collins-Livacer

[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:37.360]

[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:43.960]
We have an open line in Broward 524 and one on the starline star iod. This was our last day of food in the building

[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:51.920]
What are you laughing about? This is the last day of food on this show. I think because Rick and Sards have basically

[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:58.720]
It basically like milked off most of my food people anyway, right? I think that the food should come in at two

[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:04.580]
And then if I want a little bite on the way out I could bite this and if not I just to get that out of here

[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.820]
Before the feeding friends he starts

[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.020]

No, that's not the nothing we went to that

[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:30.980]
I've been saying the same thing that you've been saying for the last five years about the people down here

[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.480]
And why they can't get these crowds at

[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.720]
At pump and oh I can't understand because it's just these people here

[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.600]
They know nothing from anything. I mean no matter what it is they just they don't know about it

[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.820]
They're not interested. They don't care. It just don't bother them well. I'm an old man too

And they couldn't get over 12,000 people. Yeah, I laid three to one to somebody

[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:28.020]
That they wouldn't have 25,000 people. They don't forget Mickey Peterson Walter Ross. Yeah

And two triples got back 280 and yes, I lost

There you go. Well, that's not bad. It's called minimizing your losing

[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.240]

Couple of days after our big breeders crowned poppin O Park

He probably cast another big bet. He's a good guy. He's a hundred and seventy seven years old

[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:55.540]
But he was uh crawling around outside the restroom and uh was calling out to me for help and I met the guy up there

[00:23:55.540 --> 00:24:00.000]
He's a good guy and he doesn't bet on Mickey McNichol. That's why he's still solvent

[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.520]
I don't want to go into a big thing about Mickey McNichol's I do I've been telling you for years. Stay away

[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.300]
Okay, and I usually avoid it too, but

I'm Tony. He does more work in one day up there than most bureaucrats doing a lifetime

[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.140]
For Lauderdale. Yeah, I knew. Hi

[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.700]
Yeah, you gotta explain something to me. I'm a degenerate horse player too

[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:08.740]
You have three horses going you shall boof red in a desperate drive sir. That's the answer. Michelle boof red

[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:13.440]
Reason Mickey doesn't go this way. He has tickets on the other horses. That's why you said that sir

[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:19.020]
I have no comment. Yeah, you have three horses in the second half of the double the eighth race now

[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:23.880]
Yeah, they they mess you up and you're not live in the double because you can't you do the wrong tickets

[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:29.980]
I wouldn't you box those things because I'm a more because I'm a moron I go back to do it

[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.040]
I'm all at this point. I'm just all messed up in the head

[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:38.840]
Alambardo is there huck in a trinoc which is enough to drive anybody crazy and he just cashed to 500 dollar perfect

[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:44.120]
And I'm going nuts and I go back up there and I've got I'm going to either play the three seven nine or the one

[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.800]
three the one three

[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:48.980]
Nine

[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.560]
You can throw out real no wait a minute. I know. I'm good about the one

[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.900]
I bet the one seven nine

[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.820]
I had to throw somebody out and I threw out the three

[00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:01.380]
And the reason I bet the three in the first places because all the early money in the double pools

[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.620]
I mean enormous early money was on the three

[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.620]
Yeah, and the horse goes off finally

[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:12.500]
15 to one and wins in a desperate drive and Kevin Wallace comes with a seven which I love because he just bought the horse and

[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.000]
Newsproaks right

[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.960]
Right and he comes up and just gets second at the wire. It's a four hundred dollar perfect

[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:24.720]
And it's about a forty two hundred dollar trifecta and I'm sitting there holding my own right was four hundred and eighteen

[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:29.820]
Now you know I'm a schmucks or that's why I couldn't understand if you like those three horses enough to better

[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.840]
Then you box him in the perfect and you better try

[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.520]
Fecta and then you have a box four horses in the trifecta

[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:41.780]
Easily could have the three six seven nine and it came out of three seven six with pavio was the third choice

[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.760]
And you got four two hundred bucks

[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:49.800]
And if you haven't played him at least five dollars to win exactly like my twenty to one shot in the second race

[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.840]
Would Jeff Gregory who's such a great trotting man and a horse look good

[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.440]
He was six to one in the morning line. They let him go off at twenty to one

[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.400]
There's nothing in the race and he comes weaving through traffic in the stretch

[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:04.420]
Comes flying to the outside and wins handling going away and pays forty five dollars

[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.580]
And I'm sitting there with four double tickets

[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.840]
Like a schmuck. We know what I do in something like that

[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.200]
I'll play that's the

[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.740]
Well, I did cover myself with Dick Turner, but not enough

[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.700]
I've had twenty bucks to win, but what does that he went off three to one right right?

[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.280]
I only got back eighty so I'm still getting back five six hundred dollars on a four dollar double

[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.480]
I get back eighty bucks

[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.760]
I'm out of about even for my investment in the first three races

[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.940]
I want to tell you how bad it was last night the first four races

[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.320]
Counting the double which I didn't cast the second race, but I had the winner on my ticket

[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.140]
So I've got three of the first four races, right?

[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.100]
At the end of four races I'm up one dollar

[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.320]
You know it's because I tell you what a good gambler I am

[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:50.180]
Up one dollar I got three winners one of which paid forty five dollars. I'm up a dollar

[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.880]
Sure, and then this al l'ambard l'abago comes over there bugging around

[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.960]
Oh, geez, and after we cast that ticket I kept going up there talking to him. Think. Can he knew something?

[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:04.460]
You're a fruit better. Oh very worst. I'm a good handicap or the worst better in the world

[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.680]
I'm a great handicap

[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.560]
I just wanted to ask you that because I just couldn't because I'm a schmuck and at least I'm honest about it

[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.860]
I'm a moron and I saw four hundred eighteen dollars. Yeah, and I get so mentally distraught

[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:19.140]
I mean the three seven nine is guaranteed of course they bet harming with that one horse off the board

[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:23.460]
He's a cheap piece of garbage. He was nowhere's right and that's me

[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.960]
Okay, Neil. Better luck next time. Yeah, okay

[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.140]
Hey, listen you people don't want to hear about our tough nights at the track. You don't care

[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:34.780]
You people all work your brains out and if you all work so hard how come you listen?

[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.720]
and pansies

[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.220]
126 at WIOD. Let's take a call from Fort Lauderdale

[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:48.360]
Hi, hi, Happy Birthday Neil. Thank you so much. I agree with you. You have a bunch of

[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:54.620]
Dennis down here at the F4 I just moved in here. Well, I can't all be live wires like you and me sir

[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.080]
Well, I'm a deadhead too. Well, that's what I meant

[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.880]
All that to sit in my apartment is my crack

[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.620]
I'm serious. Yeah, yeah, well crack this

[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:16.760]
26 after what a WIOD we have an open line and Broward 524. Let's try hi, Alia. Neil. Yes, sir. Happy birthday, buddy

[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:21.740]
Thank you, dude. Listen, were you at the game yesterday? I sure was. What do you think about Dauphin Jenny? Neil?

[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.120]
What do I think about him? Yeah, what do you think about no opinion? No opinion? No

[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:30.400]
You don't think the man seen his better days. I don't I mean you don't get any of that stuff

[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:36.040]
I'm not into the wave and I'm not into Dauphin Denny. I'm just I just go there and I watch the game and I'm into the game and I

[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:42.420]
You know, I get excited at the right times and I react like I understand what the game is about instead of forgetting into all this

[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:42.900]
spurious

[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.880]
Kind of sophomore a crap, you know

[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:50.780]
Kind of the sidelines, though. Yeah. I'm wondering what's going on in the field and I'm interested in the fights in the

[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.600]
Stands or the people who are pouring beer on their head. That's just not my bag

[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.440]
There were a couple good fights, too, Neil

[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:01.380]
Well, if you want to see that, I guess you could you know pay extra and go to the arena and watch the real fights

[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.400]
No, but I'm serious. I don't think the man the man couldn't motivate me to

[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:11.080]
Jesus. I don't know. Well, everybody lose it sooner or later just ask mr. Weaver. I mean

[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:18.880]
Mr. King. Yeah, I think maybe they should look into getting Sebastian. Maybe leasing him from the

[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:31.780]
Have you noticed when they play that at the stadium? It's like sped up. It's about 52 rpm

[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:36.560]
You know what I say? Yeah, that's all the dead heads maybe get a little more motivated

[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.760]
It sounds like the mouse get tears or something on speed. I don't know what it is

[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.200]
But it'll be a listen about your loud. I will say that it's real loud

[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:51.320]
Isn't it? Yeah, it is real loud man. Do they play those speakers loud at that stadium? I mean real loud

[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:56.260]
Everything there is loud loud and when Reneerie comes on with those damn glasses already

[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.060]
Give me a rest with that will you?

[00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:58.720]
Jay

[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:03.120]
Hey me a listen about your car. Yeah, I saw one today at the UM campus

[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:10.060]
Same exact color. Are you serious? It was a convertible though. Oh, that's the count black top. It was that one

[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:15.380]
I saw it. It was at the 91. Yeah, brand new with the CR1 taillights

[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:23.260]
Uh, no, it was regular one. No, that's the 90 then. Was it the 90? Yeah. Yeah, uh, no, what you mean the round

[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:28.480]
The round taillights no, that's the squared like that CR1 taillights

[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:35.300]
Right, okay round is 90 or earlier right that color would have to be a 90. Well, that's okay. It's a nice try

[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:40.640]
Yeah, it was it was a black. I mean, they had a black top. Yeah, that's probably the one I saw

[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:46.180]
I saw it a couple of months ago. That's what inspired me to get this one. Oh, yeah down here in my amuseot

[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.720]
As somewhere. Yeah

[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.640]
Uh, anyway, you recognize the voice Neil. No. Oh, okay

[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.820]
It's super Dave Jr. Oh

[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.580]
You see I'm not that bad of a guy anyway after all honey. Well, whatever you say

[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.800]
Have a great life. Thank you Neil 129

[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:08.660]
At W. I. D. Why I like having that zoom to upset here. It did it picks it up. I mean you can hear the reverb just

[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.980]
Puking through that tube

[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:16.880]
It's great. Okay. I have several different reports on the mail by the way. Uh, who was it said that it was just Saturday's mail

[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.900]
Narvan, I think said that

[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.760]
And uh, hellsion keeps giving me six different stories

[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.380]
See that's what I mean about the mail here. You don't know what the hell's going on

[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:33.620]
I mean, I sure hope we can do better than that in the first weekend 1131 bucks for Camilla's house get those checks in the mail today

[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.760]
Let's have a gigantic week

[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:43.500]
I mean if we can do 10 or 15 grand the first week then the 100 grand should be a snap because we've got till January the 15th is our deadline

[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.760]
But we've got to have a big first week

[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:51.260]
Don't just sit around on your haunches waiting for everybody else to do it get those checkbooks out crack it out

What's the story

[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.240]
That was it

[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.880]
That was it

[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.300]
Oh, that is weak that is really weak. I think that is the worst start

[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.240]
We have ever had

[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:06.840]

[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.740]
Jay from the keys from New Jersey.

[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:08.420]
Yeah.

[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.100]
I have a friend and fourth lord of the automata

[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:12.420]
who listened to you on the radio.

[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.540]
Been doing it for two years.

[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.760]
I was paying my bills in my office here today.

[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:16.340]
Yeah.

[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.760]
My young son goes to my youngest son

[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.960]
goes to the school of the art and two to Chicago.

[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:21.620]
Great.

[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.000]
Three of us are going to take a trip out there

[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.900]
to watch a bull's game.

[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.240]
You give us a recommendation on a good restaurant to go out.

[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.380]
He lives on two, three West Lakes.

[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.860]
Well, I can't, I don't know addresses.

[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.660]
Go to Scousies, you like Italian?

[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:37.300]
Love it.

[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.120]
Scousies.

[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.240]
Scousies?

[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:39.620]
Yeah.

[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.140]
Okay.

[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:40.880]
Look it up.

[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:41.540]
Have a good day.

[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:42.000]
Okay.

[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:42.300]
Bye.

[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:43.580]
What is this?

[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.740]
Are we going to get started in Chicago intensive again

[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:46.360]
on my birthday?

[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.480]
First, first, one, one, five, two, three.

[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.780]
It could be there.

[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:58.260]
There it is on the very first, first, the round one.

[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.160]
It could touch the home under the air.

[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.040]
I want to wave love to you.

[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:04.660]
Okay.

[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:05.980]
Let's get baseball going again.

[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:06.280]
Okay.

[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:14.420]
138 at WIOD, we have Andy in the window standing like Rumpel Stiltskin jumping up and down

[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:15.600]
to making guttural sounds.

[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.380]
Boy, they're out of control today for a Monday.

[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.620]
What a week this is going to be.

[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:23.560]
And Rick and Sons, by the way, so you understand how nervous everybody is here, they're like

[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:28.220]
doing heavy, deep, breathing exercises in the corner in training because they have that big,

[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.700]
big stiff competition.

[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.160]
Stiff is the operative word this afternoon.

[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.800]
Mr. Contrad Controversy.

[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.460]
Woo, boy.

[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.160]
I can't wait.

[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.280]
We got Tom Jicca.

[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.060]
I want to say this.

[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:41.960]
I really mean this.

[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.240]
If the rumor about you Dell being on there is true.

[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.780]
That would possibly be.

[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:49.520]
There have been a lot of embarrassing things in the market like that.

[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:56.440]
But that would be the bottom when you have to go on somebody else's show to launch an attack

[00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:01.140]
because you couldn't do it on your own show because the management is too spineless and paranoid.

[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.340]
That's really desperate.

[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:11.440]
When you have to go from 100,000 watt, classy FM to a four watt pop up toaster AMFTL.

[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.420]
Greg, don't do it.

[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.880]
When it comes to embarrassment, I guess he's used to it five days a week.

[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.760]
Let's go to Fort Lauderdale.

[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:21.400]
Hi, Neil.

[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:22.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:22.720]
Happy birthday.

[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.860]
Thank you so much.

[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.780]
We enjoy your show very much.

[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:32.740]
Actually, the reason I'm calling is I go up by 95 back and forth between here and Jacksonville all the time.

[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:33.840]
Business.

[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:39.520]
Last week, worst news than the apathy on the sports down here.

[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:40.660]
Worst news.

[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.900]
30 to 40 percent of the cars with the plate.

[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:46.660]
Go back.

[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.020]
My days are the beard.

[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.300]
They're on their way down.

[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:50.040]
They're here.

[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.140]
The frogs are jumping.

[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.440]
Aftermarket, wheel covers, maps all over the dashboard.

[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.160]
55 miles an hour.

[00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:58.360]
No, 55.

[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.720]
Boy, they must be speeding it up from last year.

[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:01.700]
Now, they were kind of the path.

[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.200]
35.

[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.780]
They're kind of between Daytona and the Cape.

[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.860]
So that means about a week from now, they'll be getting down here.

[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.840]
And every one of them will come here.

[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.500]
Every one of them is old and ugly.

[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.280]
I mean older and uglier than the next one.

[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.000]
Just, oh, god.

[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.200]
I'm poor both wearing their hands.

[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.800]
Don't they understand that those Canadian's are really kicking ass up there.

[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.600]
It's time to get back to the forum with Danny Gallivan and Frank Selkie Jr.

[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:32.100]
And they're looking at the maps, you know, and they're arguing back and forth around 98-95.

[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.040]
There's nowhere to get off.

[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.800]
I don't know what the hell they're arguing about.

[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:35.280]
Yeah.

[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.680]
Stick them in a highway and give them a map where the arrow pointed to do north.

[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.840]
I think I do need to figure that out.

[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.480]
What's got them all, all of a sudden.

[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:43.880]
Yeah.

[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.040]
If you look at the map, it says, I-95, right?

[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:48.840]
Yeah.

[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.200]
If you look at the signs of the side of the road, it says 65, and I think they're on the wrong road.

[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.600]
They think they're on the wrong road.

[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:57.360]
Hmm.

[00:39:59.060 --> 00:39:59.420]
Okay.

[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:00.300]
All right.

[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.160]
Think about that.

[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:02.000]
Okay.

[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.120]
Neil, have a good one.

[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:03.980]
Good to talk to you.

[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.000]
Enjoy your show.

[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:05.840]
Have a great life.

[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.220]
Be good.

[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:08.980]
Oh, come on.

[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.020]
I will say this.

[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.940]
They've got a better national anthem than we do.

[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.140]
They're really doing.

[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.500]
How about those maple leaves?

[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.600]
Boy, they are really kicking ass.

[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:19.200]
They're on.

[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.840]
They are pathetic.

[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.360]
Pathetic would be an overstatement.

[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:29.220]
They are embarrassing and humiliating and just grotesque.

[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:30.440]
God.

[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.980]
Take that grand martian stick him in the desert and a puck in his mouth.

[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:39.200]
Man.

[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:44.000]
And that Gary Lehman sent him to Montreal.

[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.560]
Put him on a bus with the frogs and send the deer field beach.

[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:55.460]
Boy, foster hewitt would best just be shaking his head and his fist.

[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:56.580]
Hollywood.

[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.400]
This is Steve Kane for abortions or us.

[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.780]
Reminding everyone in the south Florida area, at least between sunrise and open park

[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:05.260]
bouvard.

[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:09.880]
Turn into my show on radio 1400 WFTL.

[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.000]
I paid for the beer.

[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.580]
142 at WIOD.

[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.800]
We have an opening and brow in his matter.

[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.700]
Fact 524.

[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:18.660]
I can't wait.

[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.120]
524.

[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:21.820]
9463.

[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.260]
It's going to be really exciting in those first 10 or 15 minutes.

[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:30.500]
And then the law will be, I think it will take about two and a half days in those people who are sampling.

[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:44.680]
After the first Michael de Sisto and Rick Ciderman and the year-end lady and the usual cast of a Reverend Rick Patterson and Peterson and then the other Rick, what was his name?

[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.080]
Rick Unic or whatever that guy's name.

[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:50.460]
After that, the law will be back fast.

[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.320]
Mobile on the star line.

[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:53.400]
Bill.

[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:55.120]
Happy Birthday.

[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.360]
Thank you.

[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.820]
How many years are you today?

[00:41:59.120 --> 00:41:59.640]
86.

[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:01.380]
48.

[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.240]
I turned 43 today.

[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.640]
So we shared a second.

[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:05.820]
Well, happy birthday, sir.

[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:06.560]
I'm 48.

[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.340]
So you're just a young whipper, snapper.

[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.840]
Well, well, it all goes with the territory.

[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:18.580]
But glad to hear you're having a good day and take care of Scorpio tendencies.

[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:19.440]
Okay.

[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:20.540]
Thanks again.

[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.280]
Have a happy birthday.

[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:21.760]
Okay.

[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.160]
Thank you and take care of this.

[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:24.180]
143.

[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:27.340]
At WIOD, we have an open line on the star line.

[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:29.420]
Don't forget our big remote Wednesday at Specs.

[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:35.080]
You'll be able to come out and buy those cassettes, bring lots of money, buy some CDs and videos and a whole bunch of stuff.

[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.820]
And then we'll have a little table out front in Iliana.

[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.680]
It's going to be selling pedaling her wares.

[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:44.260]
She's going to be selling those t-shirts and our best of kneeled number three.

[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.580]
And a partridge in a pair of three.

[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.580]
And it's going to be great.

[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.320]
And hopefully we'll raise like tons of money.

[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:52.020]
But in the meantime, get those checks and those things in the mail.

[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:58.120]
I mean, if that's all the mail on our opening Monday, I am distraught on beside myself.

[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.160]
That's pathetic.

[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.160]
That is weak.

[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.740]
Man, 1131 bucks.

[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.680]
God, I lost more than that at Pompo just in the last two races.

[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:10.540]
Miami.

[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:11.460]
Okay.

[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:13.540]
Oh, yeah.

[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:15.760]
Hello.

[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:16.660]
Hello.

[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:17.160]
Yes.

[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:17.840]
Yeah.

[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:19.040]
Neil?

[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:19.460]
Yeah.

[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:20.040]
Hi.

[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.700]
This is Joe over Channel 4.

[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:31.820]
I just wanted to get your response on our coverage over at Pompo with Tony doing the show live on Friday night.

[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.740]
Well, if I would have seen it, I would have been great.

[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.280]
I didn't see Tony out there, is there?

[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.020]
Well, in fact, Tony and I had little chatty's looking great.

[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:45.660]
Well, I just wanted to give us a little take on here because, you know, no one, you see it?

[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:50.900]
I'm just kidding to say that no one really cares about the harness racing in town and we did our show out there.

[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:55.820]
And by the way, on Sports Final last night, we had Dion saying, coming up on Sports Final.

[00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:00.160]
Well, you guys are really are doing it.

[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:00.880]
What can I say?

[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.600]
You are really doing it.

[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.600]
And you're going to have our little friend over there in a little while.

[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.540]
Little Bob Mayer, we got all the telephone books on the chair for him.

[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.540]
He's where I'll set to go.

[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.360]
Yeah, he's really excited.

[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:12.720]
He's going out, have a nice lunch.

[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:17.660]
And Rick Rally is going to sit on the floor so he doesn't kind of like tower over him.

[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.000]
It's going to feel right at home.

[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.560]
Yeah, Bob is doing a series on privacy, so it ought to be interesting.

[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:24.300]
Great.

[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.260]
Okay, you have a happy birthday, Neil.

[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.880]
All of us over here in Channel 4 will be always listening to you.

[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:32.780]
Okay, Joe.

[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.240]
Okay, give Bob Weaver a kiss on the wig for him.

[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:36.660]
Okay, see you.

[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:37.120]
Bye-bye.

[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:38.720]
145 at WIOD.

[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.900]
We have an open line at Dave.

[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.440]
751-9463.

[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.140]
We had a call from Dick Purtin today.

[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.840]
We had a call from Phil Saltsman.

[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.860]
We had a call from the famous Hank Goldberg.

[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:51.680]
By didn't pay for the beer.

[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.260]
And it was just been nonstop all day.

[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:58.700]
We got a bunch of flowers outside Cheryl's door on her desk in her seat in her drawers.

[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:00.580]
Palm Beach.

[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:01.820]
Hello, Neil.

[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.440]
I have a birthday wish from your friends at W.

[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:06.580]
Hi, Anne Z.

[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.000]
And Hal and Dale.

[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.420]
A happy birthday to you, Neil.

[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.840]
A happy birthday to you.

[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:16.560]
We pulled our funds and baked you a cake.

[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.500]
Piled high with icing.

[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.340]
Oh, sweet and creamy.

[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.080]
Please eat it all and lick the plate.

[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:27.040]
As your blood sugar rises, we hope you turn, man.

[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:27.940]
Ow!

[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:32.060]
By the way, Hank did not say for the beer.

[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:32.840]
Ow!

[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:40.060]
That Tim Williams boy, he got a sense of humor.

[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.320]
Unbelievable.

[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:43.880]
Tim, you're really doing it.

[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.100]
You're right on top of it.

[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:49.380]
And people are talking about it all over Carol's city, so get the hell on.

[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:53.580]
What a beautiful day.

[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.600]
Lay in pain for the beer.

[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.460]
Look at that.

[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.000]
The maple leaves are forfeiting.

[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:09.640]
They're turning.

[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:10.660]
They're leaving the ice.

[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.760]
The crowd is cheering.

[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.360]
They're getting to a fever pitch.

[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.160]
One.

[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:16.860]
What a sigh of relief.

[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:21.080]
There he goes.

[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:24.720]
Peter Inge said, your number one, he just took that golly glove off and

[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.340]
give a big salute to the fans on his way out of the garden.

[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.080]
Just tremendous.

[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.200]
West Miami.

[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:31.260]
Hello.

[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:33.660]
You'll be there.

[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:35.540]
You'll be gone.

[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:38.080]
Oh, here he is, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.220]
He still hasn't recovered.

[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:42.020]
He's still a very smart.

[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:46.840]
I thought that by the way, by the time the weekend was over, he would have recovered from a week ago.

[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.780]
He's still a Friday, but he's still just a coming apart of the scenes.

[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:50.840]
Kendall.

[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:57.540]
Well, he thought, first of all, he had first time.

[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.860]
Yeah, I was waiting so long and was still asleep.

[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:04.300]
But anyways, happy birthday.

[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:05.320]
It's number one.

[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:14.620]
Number two, not to still on, say from Canada, same time, same day, same satellite channel.

[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.280]
It is.

[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:16.620]
Well, I'll be dang.

[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:17.780]
How come it's not in the book?

[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:18.700]
I don't know.

[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:21.900]
I guess you're not putting it in the book, but I found that out for you.

[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:27.780]
And number three, as fire reports from Steve, guess who his real guest really is.

[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.100]
Now, this is Tom Jicke.

[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:34.800]
Well, now Tom may be one of the guests, but the PS3's just on.

[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:35.300]
Yeah.

[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.160]
Gilbert Solomon.

[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:39.780]
I got news for you.

[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:43.120]
That's the greatest favor anybody could ever do us.

[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.560]
Okay, Steve, we thank you profusely more power to you.

[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.320]
I hope that you have a wonderful life together.

[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.420]
He can be.

[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:50.600]
He can desperate.

[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:51.920]
Yeah, you said it.

[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.180]
Okay, well, get a happy birthday.

[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:54.900]
Thanks.

[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:55.380]
Bye-bye.

[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:55.740]
Bye.

[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:56.380]
Wow.

[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.480]
Boy, when you lose Gilbert, you're really slipping, huh?

[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:02.840]
Because he's pretty loyal.

[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:08.480]
Last week, thousands of fans received their horse owners packets and joined 610 WIOD at

[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:12.480]
Poppano Harness to cheer our adopted horse Christmas list.

[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:18.120]
Remember to activate your membership in the 610 WIOD Poppano Harness fan racing stable by

And listen to my show every day to find out when our adopted horse is next scheduled a race.

[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:36.380]
Then make sure you use your horse owners' pants for free clubhouse admission and to record your attendance each and every time our adopted horse races.

[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:43.620]
You'll guarantee yourself a share of the winnings if you visit the track every time the adopted horse races throughout the season at Poppano Park.

[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:58.980]

Poppano Harness easy to get to it's just west of I-95 in South of Atlantic Polo Harden in Poppano Beach.

[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:10.340]
And don't forget Great Harness Racing nightly Wednesday through Sunday night first post time 730 PM.

[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:22.740]
We'll get back to the reruns in a minute for the first to remind you to get on the horn and mail me your Camilla Sauce contribution.

[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:27.640]
For 20 bucks you'll get this year's Neil Rogers cassette and your money will go to a great cause.

[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:31.500]
Now back to the vest of Neil on 610 WIOD.

[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:38.440]
Hey, everybody.

[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.860]
It's Bruce, your fudge man.

[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.520]
Who's the first one to try one of my fudge?

[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:51.080]
Oh, there's a big white truck on the side of the road as he cracks the smile he says.

[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:58.420]
So first, first back yeah, yeah.

[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:04.600]
Then and down the verse, yeah, away.

[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:10.860]
Then we'll make it up right away.

[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:13.760]
Hurry for the fun.

[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.760]
Now the gut, baby.

[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:18.860]
Cherokee, now back to the spark we knew.

[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.540]
Push up, I-95.

[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.740]
I'll give you the fudge.

[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:29.540]
You can be your money for her and bring your rock and hunt funny.

[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:37.100]
So first back is a big white truck where you can weigh your laughter.

[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:41.320]
Fudge back baby.

[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:47.020]
I'm sorry, I couldn't have you waiting a lot.

[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:49.560]
Wait, let me take a bend over here a second.

[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:52.240]
Oh, sure, we have that.

[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:54.060]
Just come on around back.

[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.780]
I'll be having a third year of the E.S.

[00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:00.120]
Fudge back, Fudge back, Fudge back.

[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:00.820]
Fudge back, Fudge back.

[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.680]
Fudge back, Fudge back.

[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.140]
No money here, have it for nothing honey.

[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:10.560]
154 at WIOD, Gloria is on one.

[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:11.620]
Hello.

[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:13.240]
Hi, how are you?

[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:13.960]
Okay.

[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.020]
I made a mistake and came down.

[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.340]
I've very road to go to this game, Boulevard.

[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:19.920]
Yeah.

[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.020]
They're working on the railroad tracks.

[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:25.980]
You cannot get across it.

[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:30.220]
You're going to have to get off to go to your specs remote office.

[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.460]
And how on the Elbeach Boulevard and go to U.S.

[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:33.480]
want to go south.

[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.780]
You can't get across Ives Dury Road.

[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.480]
You can't cross the railroad tracks.

[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.020]
And Ives Dury Road and this game Boulevard.

[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.000]
How long is that going to go on?

[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:46.560]
Six years?

[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:47.680]
Usually a week.

[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.800]
Oh, geez, great.

[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:52.720]
You know, I'll let you know.

[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:56.080]
Through tomorrow we should have someone in the area or when?

[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.680]
Well, listen, is that a big deal though?

[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.500]
If they come across Hall and Dale Beach Boulevard and come south?

[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.600]
No, it's much better.

[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.420]
If they're coming from the south, they don't have to worry about it all together.

[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:06.140]
Exactly.

[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:10.780]
But if they're taking I-95, they don't get to go to Ives Dury Road.

[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:13.220]
Well, I appreciate it.

[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:19.580]
Because otherwise you're going to get in all that traffic on Dixie Highway and it's bumper to bumper.

[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:20.200]
Yeah.

[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.960]
I found that out the hard way today too.

[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:27.200]
Okay, thanks, Gloria.

[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.180]
All righty.

[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:28.880]
Appreciate it.

[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:29.380]
Bye-bye.

[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:33.420]
155 at WIOD in Mobile on the Starline.

[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:34.300]
How you doing now?

[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:34.820]
Okay.

[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:35.860]
Happy birthday.

[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:36.600]
Thanks.

[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.480]
I just came from the same area as she's talking about it.

[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:40.460]
Bedlam over there.

[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.260]
Oh, great.

[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:41.820]
Terrible.

[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:45.180]
Yeah, well, they probably knew we were coming here Wednesday to throw it all up.

[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:46.300]
Ah, you know how they are.

[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:48.240]
They all tied up over there anyway.

[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:51.000]
That's another reason to go out and vote three times tomorrow.

[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:51.680]
Absolutely.

[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:56.740]
Listen, the dolphin's song that you play, you know, is Miami Dolphin's song?

[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:57.180]
Yeah.

[00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:59.520]
Is it possible can you buy that anywhere?

[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:00.280]
No.

[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:01.760]
Oh, my God.

[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.360]
Not that I know of.

[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.540]
I want to buy that on cassette.

[00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:06.280]
I love it.

[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.340]
And I like the Canadian national anthem too.

[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.020]
Can you buy it?

[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:11.460]
No.

[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.300]
What do you mean can you buy it?

[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:13.920]
You have to go out.

[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.640]
What I said, can you buy it in a store?

[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.700]
Yeah, you can go out and buy a national anthem record that's got like eight

[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:20.360]
Julian national anthem's on it.

[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:20.440]

[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:23.940]
But you can't go in and just buy a record that's got the Canadian national anthem on it.

[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:24.460]
Okay.

[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.040]
What do you think this is Ottawa?

[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:28.320]
Oh, okay.

[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:28.780]
Sorry.

[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:29.860]
Over the rough riders.

[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:30.880]
Have a nice day.

[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:31.640]
Thank you.

[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:32.200]
Man.

[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:33.920]
North Dave.

[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:34.980]
Hello.

[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:35.660]
Hi.

[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:36.200]
Hi.

[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:39.980]
I just called to say wish you a happy birthday and I enjoy your show.

[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:40.660]
Thank you.

[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:45.500]
And I'd like to call back sometime and let you know that when I was on the, um,

[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:50.360]
in the Godfather area on set, now they were filming it.

[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:52.480]
I think you'd find it interesting.

[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:53.280]
Okay.

[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:53.980]
Okay.

[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.100]
Happy birthday and tell Bill Kolder.

[00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:56.880]
We miss him.

[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:57.300]
Okay.

[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:57.680]
Thanks.

[00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:58.160]
Thank you.

[00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:58.560]
Bye-bye.

[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.240]
156 at WIOD.

[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:07.040]
Boy, the show is zipped along today, but the last seven or eight minutes have a feeling you're going to be like a lifetime.

[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:07.880]
Am I right?

[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.600]
I just have that feeling in my bones.

[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:10.800]
Lake Worth.

[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:12.680]
Lake Worth here.

[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:13.700]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:20.240]
Uh, as regards to your, uh, playing about 50,000 people missing at the stadium.

[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:21.160]
Yeah.

[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:26.540]
I called yesterday trying to get a couple of tickets for the Raiders game.

[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.840]
They offered me the end zone for a hundred.

[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.560]
Well, we're not talking about the Raiders games, sir.

[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.900]
That's not what we're talking about.

[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.800]
We're talking about yesterday's game, Phoenix.

[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:35.620]
I understand.

[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:43.040]
But you think that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that they're so high on their prices.

[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.200]
Has something to do with that?

[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:47.160]
Well, they know because the seats that you're talking about are club seats.

[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:52.500]
There were plenty of like regular ordinary seats all over the stadium available yesterday.

[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.760]
Well, plenty, like almost 20,000 of them.

[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.400]
I understand that.

[00:54:57.580 --> 00:54:57.800]
All right.

[00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:59.160]
I stand corrected.

[00:54:59.460 --> 00:54:59.820]
Okay.

[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:02.760]
Oh, man.

[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:04.700]
See, I just can't handle that.

[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.560]
I can't handle the excuses.

[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:09.800]
This is the toughest time to get through to people.

[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.220]
They just got a million excuses.

[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:14.360]
I realized the club seats, their prices exorbitant.

[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:14.660]
Okay.

[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.260]
And there are lots of other things.

[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.680]
The price is real hefty.

[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:25.720]
But let's face it, most of us waste more money in one day on crap than, uh, Jimmy Carter made in years.

[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:26.340]
Okay.

[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:29.480]
So let's stop the excuses.

[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:29.860]
All right.

[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:33.540]
Rather, have you just admit that you're cheap and you're lazy and you're a bunch of slime balls?

[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:34.820]
That would at least that would be honest.

[00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:37.540]
Instead of all these damn excuses.

[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:40.660]
And boy, I'll tell you one thing.

[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:45.280]
If the thing with Camilla's house doesn't really pick up heavy duty this week, I'm going to be psychotic.

[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:54.400]
We set a goal of 100,000 guaranteed every Monday, every Monday without fail last year after the big weekend.

[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:59.760]
Because weekends are generally time when people are sitting home and sitting going out to the dolphin game and just staying, you know, hanging out.

[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:03.120]
That's the time when the big money comes in is on Monday.

[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:05.680]
Yeah, get on here.

[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.960]
And 1131 bucks, that's sorry.

[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:15.420]
That's a pretty piss poor start when we're trying to raise some serious money for a great cause.

[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:15.860]
Okay.

[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:22.660]
And we got 475 people in the programming office working their brains out on this project.

[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:26.740]
Okay. We used to do it with one or two, but now it's become so mammoth.

[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.020]
Hey, there he is. Chuck Meyer.

[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:30.100]
Nice. So that one five is still coming.

[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:32.000]
Here he comes. Chuck. He's coming right now.

[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:38.180]
I got it. I got it. Oh, you got to 6.5. No, I got the one five. Oh, here's the one back there, Chuck.

[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.140]
What a guy.

[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:44.480]
What an incredible. He still thinks the pirates are going to be in the world series.

[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:46.120]
What a surprise. He's going to wake up.

[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:49.520]
Anyway, get those checks in the mail. Johnny Darkle looks great.

[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:51.660]
Life is wonderful. Rick and Dutter coming along.

[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:55.700]
Next, stay tuned to 6.10. Don't mess around with any of those pop-up toast.

[00:56:56.100 --> 00:57:00.300]
Well, give it a try for two, three minutes. You'll be back before you can say ponderous.

[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:03.100]
Music
