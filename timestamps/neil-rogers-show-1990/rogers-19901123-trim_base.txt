[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]
From the twisted minds who brought you Halloween comes an entirely new dimension in horror.

[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:14.720]
Don't look in the oven or you'll experience the stock naked terror that is.

[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.240]
Thanks, Kiwi.

[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.960]
A family just like yours eats a bird that was once alive.

[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.760]
More stuffing, Thomas.

[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.440]
And they eat until they feel like they're going to explode.

[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.960]
But it doesn't stop there.

[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:36.940]
Uncle Luther.

[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.500]
Now it's time to entertain the inlaw.

[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.340]
Is that fish I smell or the dog?

[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.800]
I'm a lazy kid now.

[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.920]
And you'll think they're never going to leave.

[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.800]
So where do I put these suitcases?

[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:58.860]
And just when you thought you could escape by watching TV, you'd discover there is no way out.

[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.860]
Now game number two of our holiday NFL quadruple header.

[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.740]
Thanks, Kiwi.

[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.060]
The annual terror is back.

[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.200]
Class data griddle am?

[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.920]
Oh.

[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.060]
So playing in a dining room near you.

[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.820]
Wow.

[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.220]
Oh, hi here.

[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.380]
Thank you very much.

[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.060]
As here is the king.

[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260]
I don't have them around for a while.

[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.220]
But I want y'all to know what up here in Rock n' Roll Heaven.

[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.900]
I'll do the thinking of you.

[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.540]
This Christmas.

[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.920]
And I have to give y'all a special Christmas message.

[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.600]
A message of peace.

[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.680]
Like, how about a little piece of that bag, old boy?

[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.320]
Like it.

[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.720]
I got it.

[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.640]
A lock of a slam.

[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.280]
Christmas is a time of joy.

[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.760]
What time for a living?

[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.560]
And I sure would love it.

[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.180]
It takes lots of that feature you got there.

[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.400]
Like it.

[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.100]
What, we're more.

[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.300]
We're more, we're more.

[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.600]
Oh yeah, Christmas.

[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.700]
Christmas to me means family.

[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.540]
Your family means friends.

[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.620]
Your friends means getting together.

[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.480]
And getting together means eating.

[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.420]
I'll pass you that tone to take.

[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.780]
Which please?

[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.700]
Well, flaky.

[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.360]
I'll get my voice.

[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.780]
Now just one slate of you right now.

[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.100]
You know I may be a big star.

[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.100]
Maybe too big.

[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.840]
But ain't nobody so big.

[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.220]
You can't reach out a helping hand.

[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.880]
Better a helping hand.

[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.380]
Well, would you hand me a helping of those

[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.440]
my data's over there?

[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.020]
Which I believe?

[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.720]
It's like it.

[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.420]
Make a remark.

[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.140]
Now I will slam.

[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.560]
Ain't nobody so big.

[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.340]
You can't stoop to help a friend of neat

[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.420]
over the holiday season.

[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.000]
Speaking of season, you won't pass me that soft sugar.

[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.700]
When you get the chance.

[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.220]
Like it.

[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.100]
Yeah, just, just those screws of color.

[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.480]
That's right.

[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.860]
Like it.

[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.400]
I got one more.

[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.880]
So this Christmas, why don't y'all take a tip from old?

[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.260]
Hell, it's not all.

[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.900]
Leave those steak tips right where they are.

[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.440]
You know what I mean?

[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.500]
You know, I appreciate it, flaky.

[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.380]
I want you to remember, we're all part of God's great big family.

[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.160]
And you know God made man into his own image.

[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.600]
And look in the mirror.

[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.080]
I'd have to say God must be a big, big son of a gun.

[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.660]
You know what I mean?

[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.920]
I think he did.

[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.940]
But I especially want y'all to remember this one last thing.

[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.120]
When y'all this home of Christmas stringing that popcorn up

[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.800]
on the tree, save a big, big bowl for the can.

[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.760]
Extra butter to what I mean.

[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.760]
I like your deer.

[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.600]
I like you.

[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.580]
I like your muck.

[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.460]
Okay, the word is out.

[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.940]
He's a reporter for Channel 6.

[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.800]
Have you ever seen Elvis and Dave game together?

[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.620]
Son of a-

[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.880]
Son of a-

[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.720]
Hello.

[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.700]
You mean our first caller is already gone?

[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.740]
Okay, nice talking to you.

[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.400]
Another one.

[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.300]
Another refugee from Thanksgiving Day who overdid it.

[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.200]
Let's try Kendall.

[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.920]
Gobble, gobble, be y'all.

[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.380]
Okay.

[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.600]
Miami.

[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.100]
Neil.

[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.540]
Yeah.

[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.500]
I need a favor from you.

[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:53.740]
I'm a high school student.

[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.560]
I wonder if you could play that better that you had about Miami Bice.

[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.580]
Because I need to like a song thing I want to go along with.

[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.380]
I want to use it.

[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.280]
You think you could play for me?

[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.900]
You want to what?

[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.900]
I want to use that little bit that you had about Miami Bice.

[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.920]
Use it for what?

[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.380]
You want to plagiarize it?

[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.640]
Steel it and play it on like Piper high radio is that it?

[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.780]
More or less.

[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.900]
What bit?

[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.260]
Down Johnson.

[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.960]
Down Johnson.

[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.460]
Which one?

[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.360]
Which one?

[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.000]
Hellendale vice?

[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.540]
Right.

[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.920]
Hellendale vice.

[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.000]
Well that's what you got to say.

[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.200]
We've only got 3,000 carts in here.

[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.340]
Okay, I'm sorry.

[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.400]
No problem.

[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.220]
Don't get defensive.

[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.360]
It's in the machine, sir.

[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.560]
Do we deliver or what?

[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.660]
Hello?

[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.320]
We're like dominoes.

[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.780]
We deliver.

[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.180]
You got it?

[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.700]
Yeah.

[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.320]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.840]
Boy, I thought I was out of it.

[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.220]
Now I know what it's going to be like today, huh?

[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.520]
How do you like that start?

[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.420]
That's what it takes to wake me up.

[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.280]
Boy, I haven't heard a couple of calls like that in a long time since the Alice Benucho.

[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.460]
Let's talk about all those laser discs, huh?

[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.460]

[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.220]
With the blah, blah.

[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.500]
Have a great day, Roger.

[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.720]
Up yours, okay?

[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.240]
Yeah.

[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.100]
Have a great weekend.

[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.220]
He's looking to his watch saying, well, we're getting out of here real quick, huh?

[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.140]
Guess what?

[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.920]
We got a special ball game we're putting on.

[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.920]
Nobody knows about it.

[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.880]
It starts in 20 minutes.

[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.420]
We're just going to make one up.

[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.240]
Anyway.

[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.300]
There are two Miami cops with a hot newbie.

[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.960]
They're on the street, fighting crime.

[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.600]
Hey pops, that's a handicap face, sir.

[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.140]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.040]
In Allendale, Vice.

[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.400]
We get a problem.

[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.400]
The grey gang is up to the early tricks.

[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.760]
Lieutenant, isn't that the group of senior citizens who went around trying to get the early bird special after seven?

[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.040]
Yeah, they're backing down.

[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.220]
Let's go get them.

[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.620]
They'll stop at nothing to clean up this tree.

[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.120]
Hey lady, you can't cross here. You'll have to cross in the light.

[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.520]
They're determined to clean up this muddling business.

[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.780]
All right, sister, you're under arrest.

[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.980]
Oh, so now you're under arresting my wife, what's the charge?

[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.200]
Session of powder.

[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.600]
Coming in first time, let's see that white stuff.

[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.440]
Yeah, just a thought.

[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.560]
She's got over 100 bags in here.

[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.300]
Oh, what?

[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.520]
Sweet and low.

[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.820]
From that restaurant, she just came out of.

[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.840]
Let's take a minute.

[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.480]
Yeah, there can look in Miami cops on a hot newbie.

[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.800]
In Allendale, Vice.

[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.040]
We're mirroring this form on MBC.

[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.080]
Okay, any use of that material, by the way, is prohibited penalty of death.

[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.060]
It's a 21 past 10 at WIOD.

[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.020]
We're off to a rousey start this morning.

[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.800]
It's going to be great.

[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.240]
I just woke up, though, because Murray is on his way from Arnels.

[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.880]
Now, how soon are they going to be here?

[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.040]
1130.

[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.100]
1130?

[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.100]
Oh, man.

[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.160]
That's pretty far off, isn't it?

[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.200]
I bet they could be here by 1115 if they really put their hands together.

[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.620]
We got a kid in Kendall.

[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.320]
Hey, Neil.

[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.880]
Yeah.

[00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.560]
Yeah, the dolphins look real good against the reds on Monday.

[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.840]
What is all right through their defense?

[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.540]
Yeah.

[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.660]
What team are you on?

[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.440]
What team are you on, pal?

[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.940]
What?

[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.940]
Raiders, man.

[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:09.860]
Raiders, what?

[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.600]
Raiders.

[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.540]
Where do you live?

[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.660]
I live in Kendall.

[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:13.620]
You live in Kendall?

[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.680]
How long you live there?

[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.740]
Oh, I've been on my life, really.

[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.820]
How long is that?

[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:18.860]
14 years.

[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.600]
14 years, and you're a Raider fan based on what?

[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.320]
Based on anything.

[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.220]
They beat the dolphins.

[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.400]
Based on what?

[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.600]
I was supposed to go to the bathroom, but they got cream.

[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.340]
I don't believe that.

[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:28.720]
Oh, I see.

[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.800]
So if we lose one game, you're a fan of whoever, how about a Giants fan?

[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.580]
They beat us, too.

[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.860]
You like the Giants?

[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.280]
I like the Giants.

[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:34.620]
Huh?

[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.060]
Why not?

[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.780]
They beat the crap out of us.

[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.020]
How come you don't like the Giants?

[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.680]
I don't know.

[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.660]
They're too big for me.

[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.240]
They're what?

[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.040]
It's too big.

[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.080]
Yeah, big is a word.

[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.440]
Okay.

[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.140]
Look straight down.

[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.780]
You'll see what small really means.

[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.440]
Okay, pal.

[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.100]
You idiot.

[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.820]
There he is.

[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:50.840]
14 years.

[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.460]
All his life.

[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.100]
Who was it?

[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.820]
Oh, is Henry wandering around with a bottle out in front, back in the building.

[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.500]
Henry, okay.

[00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:58.840]
Cut the crap.

[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.460]
You didn't hear that little kid with his raiders.

[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.280]
I got your raider right over here, pal.

[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.220]
I got Al Davis's head on a plate.

[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.720]
You little piece of crap.

[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.480]
I hope all your friends in school, when you go back to school on Monday, know exactly who you are.

[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.440]
And just take you out in the backyard at school and beat the crap out of you.

[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.900]
I hope you look like a big walking wealth by the end of like second period, okay?

[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.000]
Slime ball.

[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.680]
W-I-O-D.

[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.300]
George is doing a monologue.

[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:26.980]
Hello.

[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:27.860]
Yes, sir.

[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.640]
Sorry about number.

[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.100]
Okay.

[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.700]
A-ha-ha-ha.

[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.840]
Likely story.

[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.060]
Oh, did we catch you with your pantaloonies, dog pal?

[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.660]
Wrong number, my butt.

[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.560]
W-I-O-D.

[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:40.860]
Yeah.

[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:41.360]
Yeah.

[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.980]
I wish the whole world was for this little bunny rabbit.

[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.420]
W-I-O-D.

[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.140]
I, uh, hold on.

[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.140]
Let me turn off down the radio.

[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:48.400]
Okay.

[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.020]
Turn down your radio, sir, and cut the crap.

[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:51.860]
I'm ready for him now.

[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.640]
I just woke up.

[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.440]
I just realized.

[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.640]
W-I-O-D.

[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.240]
Play me on the rain.

[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.080]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.120]
Okay, hold on.

[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.200]
That's Millie and Vanillie.

[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.620]
It's my mother and Gilbert.

[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.480]
Bokeh.

[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:09.300]
Hello.

[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:10.780]
Goodbye.

[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.140]
Miramar.

[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.160]
Hey, E-L.

[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:13.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.440]
I called you a couple weeks ago, told you about a cut-of-fine who's going to have the Camila's house.

[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:17.740]
Yeah.

[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.700]
And I got everyone's psyched and everyone's going to do it.

[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.240]
And, uh, I'm hoping to get a little bit over a grand.

[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:24.920]
Great.

[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.260]
That's going to be good.

[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.760]
Let's, by the way, yes, since I got your ear, I got a mid-E solution.

[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:30.800]
You want to hear?

[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.920]
We'll let them all fight it out.

[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:33.720]
Nook each other.

[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.140]
We went to live with the fallout.

[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.400]
And we buy our oil from whoever wins.

[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.560]
Sound good?

[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.040]
We have an open line in Broward, 524, W-I-O-D, and one in Palm Beach, 65-W-I-O-D.

[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:48.940]
Yeah, this is sunrise.

[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.300]
I want to speak to Neel Rogers.

[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.220]
Sure, hold on.

[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.080]
That's going to be a real winner.

[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:53.600]
Trust me.

[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.180]
Let's do sunrise on 5.

[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:55.620]
Hello.

[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.160]
Oh, boy, all the weirders are here.

[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.040]
Yeah, love it.

[00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.060]
I'm ready for this today.

[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.360]
Just kind of fits in with the ambiance of the whole day.

[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.900]
You should do something about that kid.

[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:04.840]
I mean, they're the first.

[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.520]
I told you.

[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.400]
I'm going to find out what school that kid goes to and on Monday, boys.

[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.360]
He's going to have a little tomato surprise in his pants when he gets out of there.

[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.540]
I mean, I've been a season ticket holder for a number of years now,

[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.320]
and I'm finally glad to be able to see them in the playoffs.

[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.640]
I mean, how do you like you ask somebody?

[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.180]
How come you're a raider fan?

[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:20.980]
Well, they beat us.

[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.180]
They creamed us the other day.

[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:22.440]
Right.

[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.680]
They scored a whole 13 points.

[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:25.140]
Yeah.

[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.000]
By the way, we'll beat the Browns 28 to 6.

[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.320]
I just scored just came to me.

[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.800]
I had a pretty good Thanksgiving at the Pactor House, all.

[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:33.740]
Oh, yeah?

[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.100]
Yeah.

[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.200]
But it was a bad omen.

[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.700]
This is how I walked in his baby.

[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.500]
Some started screaming as that off.

[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.660]
Oh, him and his brother Steve and his town.

[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.480]
So they're real nice.

[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.220]
Well, that's great.

[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.040]
I'm happy for you.

[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.440]
I mean, nobody in the audience cares, but I'm happy for you.

[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.620]
I know, but they're listening.

[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.100]
And they're...

[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.540]
Yeah, I mean, I don't want to do one of these shows.

[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.680]
Well, how was your Thanksgiving yesterday?

[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.380]
And what did you have?

[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.180]
Do you have cranberries?

[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.520]
Do you have the smashy potatoes?

[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.440]
Do you have black beans?

[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.380]
And nobody cares about that?

[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.440]
No cranberries.

[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.700]
Well, you know, it all comes out the same, sir.

[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:01.280]
Right, me.

[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.060]
That's true.

[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.880]
And by the way, you made...

[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.300]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:11.520]
Speaking of that, now, if Murray and Jeff, because Jeff called from pizza loft, and they're both bringing it, so keep in mind, we don't have like a whole staff of people here today, okay?

[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.840]
So it'll bring more than 20 pounds of food a piece.

[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.520]
Oh, yeah, pizza loft is great.

[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:15.960]
Yeah.

[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.060]
But you mentioned yesterday about Bill Marshall, Joey being on the air on my athletes.

[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:21.580]
Yeah.

[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.480]
I immediately called Bill Marshall and he knew nothing about it.

[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.300]
Mm-hmm.

[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.300]
So that's interesting.

[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.180]
It's curious.

[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:28.840]
Yeah.

[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.340]
Well, it's about as interesting as Thanksgiving at Rich Pactors House, I would say.

[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.980]
Hey, what do you want, you know?

[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:34.660]
It's all day.

[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:35.160]
Yeah.

[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:36.320]
Anyway, thanks, Neil.

[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:37.320]
Have a great life.

[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:37.780]
You too.

[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.820]
Don't ever call us again.

[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.060]
1032 at WIOD.

[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.340]
Now I have a feeling this is going to be an award-winner today.

[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.060]
At the beginning, I just...

[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.880]
I'm sorry, I just could not get into even being here.

[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.920]
WIOD, Georgia, smoking a big, uh, cheap Stogi.

[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:52.580]
Hello?

[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.220]
Come on, you can do it.

[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.300]
You can handle the pressure, can't you?

[00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:58.860]
No?

[00:11:59.540 --> 00:11:59.900]
Okay.

[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.560]
Let's go to Miami.

[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.060]
Hello.

[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.260]
Hey, Neil, I hope we get caught.

[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:05.940]
Right on.

[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:07.920]
1032.

[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.880]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.240]
Ah, right.

[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.060]
I echo those sentiments.

[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:17.600]
400%.

[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.040]
There's an open line on the Star Line, Star I would be.

[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.680]
We have another pinhead in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:21.980]
Hello?

[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:22.800]
Uh-oh.

[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:23.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.100]
Am I on?

[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.100]
Yes, I think so.

[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:25.940]
Sounds just like you.

[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.100]
All right, um...

[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.880]
Now you're not going to give me that raider stuff, are you?

[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.080]
No, you know, little punkle call I go to at school.

[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:31.580]
Yeah.

[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.620]
And I'm going to kick his butt on Monday.

[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:33.960]
Good.

[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.420]
Knock his teeth down his throat.

[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.120]
Let me tell you something.

[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.240]
The golfers are the best team and they're going to beat Cleveland.

[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:39.680]
And let me tell you why.

[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.300]
They lost one stupid game and that little kid better watch out.

[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:42.700]
Yeah.

[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.640]
Little idiot.

[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.140]
Right.

[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.120]
Gonna stick that football right in his poop and then inflate it.

[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:47.140]

[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:47.940]
You tell him, Neil.

[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.300]
Make a size of a watermelon.

[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:49.900]
All right.

[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:50.720]
Okay?

[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:51.160]
Okay.

[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:51.980]
Good luck to your pal.

[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.120]
You don't go to the school at kids and brow the other kids in Kindle.

[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.420]
But he's got good intentions.

[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.120]
You're full of crap, kid.

[00:12:59.500 --> 00:12:59.860]
1038.

[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.680]
But these are good because these kids who are like future callers on radio talk shows,

[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.480]
because most callers are full of crap anyway.

[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.920]
So good practice, kids.

[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.140]
Don't you love these days when the kids are out of school?

[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:09.900]
That's what I love.

[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.620]
And they call in, they make like little jackasses out of themselves.

[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.520]
It's great because someday you'll be a big jackass.

[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.300]
And you call in and pretend like you know what you're talking about.

[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.640]
We know you're all full of it.

[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.080]
Right?

[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:22.900]
Yes.

[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:23.820]
Neil.

[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.160]
No.

[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.480]
Call me off guard, everybody.

[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.100]
I know.

[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:27.960]
We like to do that.

[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:28.640]
North Miami.

[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.340]
It's called one-upsmanship, sir.

[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.040]
No matter what you're doing, we're always like way ahead of you.

[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:33.460]
Yeah.

[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.880]
So you think Steven was good.

[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.900]
He ate the bird pretty good.

[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:36.460]
Yeah.

[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.700]
I hear that.

[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.020]
Yeah.

[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.100]
I had a good bird too.

[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.060]
Well, I had to give it.

[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.260]
My parents did me a favor yesterday while I was there.

[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.200]
They gave me an inch telephone answering machine.

[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:46.940]
Oh boy.

[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.660]
How's it about making me a great tape here for the machine?

[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.000]
Okay, I'd be delighted.

[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:51.620]
All right.

[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.760]
You're on.

[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:53.760]
Okay.

[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.340]
Goofball in here right now.

[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.720]
But if you leave your name, number, shoe size, and the measurements,

[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.900]
we'll get right back to you.

[00:13:59.020 --> 00:13:59.160]
Okay.

[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.240]
Have a good day, y'all.

[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:01.860]
Thank you.

[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:02.420]
Okay.

[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.080]
1039 at WIOD.

[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.080]
21 before 11.

[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.040]
That's our Nashville correspondent, No Doubt.

[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.940]
He was hatched under a rock back by the Hermitage Under Andy Jackson's old house.

[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.840]
WIOD, Georgia's weight deed.

[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.500]
Hello.

[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.080]
Yes.

[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:17.980]
Yes.

[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:23.020]
Yeah, I like to talk about the game between the dolphins and the Los Angeles.

[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.960]
And the Los Angeles what?

[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.200]
The football game.

[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.420]
The Los Angeles what?

[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:32.900]
What's their nickname?

[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.460]
Um, used to be an Oakland.

[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.740]
What I want to talk about.

[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.240]
Used to be an Oakland, Darrell LeMonica, Penny Stabler.

[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:41.380]
What is it?

[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:44.660]
What is it, sir?

[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.180]
You can do it.

[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.140]
Come on, squeeze it out.

[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:47.760]
Okay.

[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:48.460]
I love it.

[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.140]
I love it.

[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:49.700]
Man.

[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.920]
It is so great.

[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.500]
99% of these people when you pick them up cold, man.

[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.360]
They don't let it a scream or turn into a banana.

[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:57.940]
It's great.

[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.320]
Oh, another kid from Kindle.

[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:01.480]
Hello.

[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.940]
Hello, Mr. Rogers.

[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.340]
Can you say Raider's suck?

[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.220]
Yeah.

[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.380]
Okay.

[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.080]
Good one.

[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:07.920]
Good call, pal.

[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.440]
I had another line for you, too, but you're not old enough to hear it.

[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.080]
We have an open line in Dade County.

[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.820]
Suck was part of it.

[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.780]
10.52, let's go to North Miami.

[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:19.240]
Hello.

[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.460]
Hello.

[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.340]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.280]
How are you this morning?

[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:22.700]
Great.

[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.160]
Listen, I am down here on the holiday weekend.

[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.460]
And I'm just listening to you.

[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.020]
From New York?

[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:28.980]
No, no.

[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:29.520]
From Philadelphia.

[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.300]
From Philly.

[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.120]
Well, that's close enough.

[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:31.440]
Yeah.

[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.580]
And I'm just listening to you for the very first time.

[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.440]
Are you cereal?

[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.300]
I am cereal.

[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:36.820]
Come on.

[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.120]
You're pulling my chain now.

[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:38.700]
I am oatmeal.

[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.540]
I am cereal.

[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:39.980]
Okay.

[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:45.300]
You said a few minutes ago that you are a little psychotic today.

[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.060]
Yeah.

[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:48.560]
How psychotic?

[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:53.100]
Because I'm listening to this and these people that are calling in seem to know you quite well.

[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:53.860]
Yeah.

[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.940]
Well, that's because they're crazy as I am.

[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:56.320]
Uh-huh.

[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.080]
So this is the way your show usually goes.

[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.460]
Well, I mean, there's no like predictable pattern.

[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.080]
What does that mean?

[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.320]
In other words, you expect, is this the first time you've heard the show?

[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:03.920]
Yes, sir.

[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.080]
And you expect to listen one day and you like have your finger on it?

[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.100]
Well, no, but that's why I'm asking.

[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:09.820]
That's why I was asking.

[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.860]
Well, it's hard to say this is a very bizarre, very volatile town.

[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.000]
It goes whichever way the wind is blowing just like the football fans here.

[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:16.700]
Uh-huh.

[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.580]
Well, I am a dolphin fan, but I have to tell you my allegiance goes with the Eagles.

[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.680]
And I understand they'll be there.

[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.440]
Well, we understand that.

[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.700]
And we'll kick the crap out of them.

[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.400]
But, uh-huh.

[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.360]
You probably will.

[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:26.960]
You're right.

[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.100]
Well, they're a little erratic.

[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.240]
Okay, I think they would be the kindest word I could use.

[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:31.500]
Unpredictable erratic.

[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:31.880]
Uh-huh.

[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.160]
It seems to me they've got the talent.

[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.280]
They just can't come together.

[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.100]
Oh, I will say this.

[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.580]
Unless we have a better pass rush against the Eagles than we had against the Raiders,

[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.860]
Randall Cunningham is going to run a set of the ground.

[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:41.840]
He's dangerous.

[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:42.360]
He's dangerous.

[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:42.720]
Yeah, he's dangerous.

[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.760]
I didn't see any pass rush to the dolphin fan.

[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:44.960]
No.

[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.500]
We're going to injure him in the first quarter and get his ass out of the game.

[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.280]
Thank you very much.

[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:49.520]
Yeah.

[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.260]
All right, well, it was a very interesting morning I've had listening to you.

[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.220]
Because we've only been on less than an hour and already you're kind of like trying to

[00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.260]
analyze the program.

[00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.480]
And I think you have to give it a little more time.

[00:16:59.840 --> 00:16:59.960]
Uh-huh.

[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.940]
It's like if you listen to Howard Stern for five minutes, you wouldn't get the drift of it.

[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:03.580]
That's true.

[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.620]
You would get the four words, but that would be about it.

[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.440]
All right, well, I wish you a happy holiday.

[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:09.660]
And the same to you.

[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:10.720]
And take good care.

[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:11.300]
Okay.

[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.020]
And don't be too abusive to the kids.

[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:13.780]
They don't know any more.

[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:14.060]
Exactly.

[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.000]
After we beat him up, we'll clean him off and put him back in school again.

[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:17.680]
Nice guy.

[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.100]
See ya.

[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:18.540]
All right, bye.

[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:19.980]
Give him a little bath.

[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.540]
Feed him to the dolphins.

[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:26.920]
We have an open line in date county, 7519463, 751.

[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.780]
W-I-O-D.

[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.300]
Here's a mobile on the turnpike on our star line.

[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:34.860]
Well, I'm up.

[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:35.880]
Magnal, Neil.

[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:37.700]
You're what?

[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.460]
The AC.

[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.300]
Oh, another bad phone.

[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:41.980]
Bad phone, man.

[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.980]
If I had a dollar for every bad mobile phone we got in this town, I could retire.

[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.340]
I could go in the desert myself.

[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:50.480]
Is he gone?

[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:51.720]
Look at that.

[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.800]
Not only the phone was so bad, it like one of those immediate disconnects.

[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:55.660]
Sorry, it wasn't us, sir.

[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.920]
It was your crappy phone.

[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.300]
Sorry about that.

[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:03.700]
Anybody who knows that guy buy him a new cellular phone for Hanukkah or Christmas or a Purim or something.

[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.020]
Okay.

[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.240]
That was pathetic.

[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.480]
We get a whole bunch of those.

[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.560]
And they start out in the media.

[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.260]
They're already crackling and puking.

[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.180]
And like, Marconi is rolling in his grave and then like after three, we're in the middle of a sentence.

[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.180]
Woop.

[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.560]
Just like having a Ted Bundy.

[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:18.820]
Hollywood.

[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:19.700]
Neil.

[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.320]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.760]
There's no longer Hollywood.

[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.160]
Well, what do you mean it's no longer Hollywood?

[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.960]
It's little Quebec.

[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.200]
Yeah.

[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.480]
I'm boxed in on each side now.

[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:29.860]
We.

[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.000]
A.

[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:32.860]
We A.

[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.860]
I got one on each side of me now.

[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:36.840]
Two, brick-a.

[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.060]
But down here, they got the satellite dish.

[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:39.580]
Yeah.

[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.260]
One channel.

[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:42.420]
Yeah.

[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.980]
And like, they ruined the holiday for us.

[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.820]
The worst thing's given me ever had.

[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:47.900]
They're all out in the back yard.

[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.120]
Yeah.

[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.020]
You know, with the baby.

[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:57.940]
I don't like that one as well.

[00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.940]
I like the one where the guy is singing, you know.

[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.820]
It has a little more schmaltz to it.

[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.120]
With that organ.

[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.360]
Watch what he does with it, too.

[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.240]
Okay.

[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.820]
Now, they were all out in the back yard with the baby and suits.

[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.300]
Six sizes, two small and the stomachs, forty sizes too big.

[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.880]
I want to know one thing.

[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:23.320]
Are there any French Canadians who are under the age of a hundred and look on a scale of ten better than a minus two hundred?

[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:28.600]
I mean, they are just so old and grotesque and cheap and disgusting and drive and reverse.

[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.640]
You all make a sick go away.

[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.500]
They went away now.

[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.360]
They went into where my niece, she's a waitress, right?

[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:35.780]
Yeah.

[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:36.940]
Forty eight dollar bill.

[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:37.720]
One two left.

[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:38.520]
What can I have?

[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:39.120]
Nothing.

[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:40.840]
Nothing.

[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.380]
Ah!

[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:46.560]
Yeah.

[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.820]
So now here's the best part is when you ask him something, they don't speak English.

[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:51.280]
Yeah.

[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.060]
But when they want something, they know his re-wee.

[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.300]
Now they speak real good English.

[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.580]
You're in lead, you would love those French.

[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.540]
By the way, I want to take something back.

[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:03.100]
Now I put words in Henry Barrow's mouth yesterday about the late great restaurant critic Peter Clayton.

[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:08.300]
And I got to admit, not seriously because I know Henry used to hang out with him at all those free wine tastings and all of it.

[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.740]
He said, Peter really knew his crap.

[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:10.720]
That's what he said.

[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.500]
Ah, I guess.

[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.460]
Now seriously, that's what Henry said.

[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.920]
One other thing before I go.

[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.060]
Yeah.

[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.500]
Up at Pompo-no.

[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.560]
I bought them guys on the four floor.

[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.080]
Why don't you get them guys to send in a check.

[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.260]
You know the ones that leave the bartender, 50 dollar tips and stuff.

[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.120]
Listen to me, sir.

[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:31.540]
I am trying desperately to get the people at Pompo-no park anybody to come up with some cash.

[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.520]
And so far Kelly Shepard, who is O for a lifetime, the season is the only guides giving me a check for 50 bucks.

[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:42.960]
And I've challenged all the other trainers and drivers and horsemen and horse manure to come up with some cash for Camilla's house.

[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.660]
So far, Zipety doodah.

[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:51.980]
So when I get up there on Sunday evening for my usual weekly plunge, Alan Thickelson better have a gigantic check from all those plungeers up there.

[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:52.260]
Okay.

[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.800]
That's the least they can do.

[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.060]
Really?

[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.460]
For all I've left up there and all the promotion we give him.

[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.700]
I'm out in a very least they can do.

[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.620]
I'm out in a money order because I was afraid of check with bounce.

[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:02.160]
Yeah.

[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.120]
Probably right.

[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.760]
And by the way, Mickie McNickelson's in a money money order is only no checks, Mickie.

[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.460]
Oh, he was, he was racing last night.

[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.180]
He was finishing the last race from Sunday.

[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:11.660]
Yeah, right.

[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:12.980]
And he's still in the year.

[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.240]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:14.540]
Yeah.

[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.580]
Why is the level so low on that?

[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:21.740]
Oh, geez.

[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:23.460]
That's enough.

[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.680]
Okay, it's, we got a pig report on the star line.

[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:26.940]
Hello.

[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.580]
I think I'm calling for another guy with another third pike.

[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.740]
They're on him for just out to make 36.

[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.780]
All of Turkey's are out the day.

[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.600]
Everything's giving, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:37.640]
It's the end of the month.

[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.300]
You know what that means?

[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.920]
They got about 10 units out there.

[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:40.800]
10 units?

[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:41.500]
10 units.

[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:41.880]
Yeah.

[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:42.860]
Yellow and black ones.

[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.860]
Boy, I'm shining.

[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.700]
You believe that?

[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.460]
Yeah, I believe that.

[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.320]
You're going to want that newer past clock and I see him up there.

[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:48.940]
He's in a big car.

[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:49.240]
Yeah.

[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.700]
He's in a talent deal.

[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.920]
He's the alpha clocker.

[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:52.720]
Well, I don't know.

[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.400]
Hey, if you get stopped by, I'm just asking instead of the speed.

[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.620]
I'm going to take it to the state troopers ball.

[00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:58.180]
Okay.

[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.100]
They don't have balls.

[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.220]
See ya.

[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.480]
10.58.

[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.820]
Boy, I'm Tonya.

[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.060]
They all got material today.

[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.240]
If you find anybody today's got material, just walk up to them and say, can that be felt?

[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:13.640]
Zimba.

[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.080]
Master of the romantic smile, this one.

[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:24.040]
And rock on my junior legs, that's what I'm doing.

[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.600]
Together for the first time.

[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.260]
Zimba and Seppler, rock on my junior.

[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:47.960]
Master of the romantic smile, this one.

[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:56.080]
A Sam and Sepp world, it'll take a land out of your business.

[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.060]
Well, I don't understand it.

[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:05.220]
Ticker on the, on a financial channel was moving again.

[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.120]
It was down three and a half.

[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.520]
Now it's back to where it was before.

[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.520]
What the hell is going on up there?

[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.780]
There must no Joe Brennan.

[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.260]
11.26.

[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.000]
Welcome to our post Thanksgiving Day.

[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.220]
A little, uh, pick out here.

[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:16.620]
Man.

[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.320]
On outs only down 1.24.

[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.600]
It's all over the place.

[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.260]
It's Wiggle Wobbling with less Cooper.

[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.120]
Crawl Springs.

[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.040]
Hello.

[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:25.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.440]
How you doing?

[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:26.900]
Good.

[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:26.900]

[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:26.900]

[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.020]
Did you hear my new dog I busted today?

[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:30.500]
Yeah.

[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.360]
Oh, man, you're doing the Wicked weed.

[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.220]
They had like two little flakes.

[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.940]
And they busted them both.

[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:36.560]
They're wacky.

[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.120]
They're wacky.

[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:37.440]
Yeah.

[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.220]
Did you hear a spy report from some man yesterday?

[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:41.500]
About.

[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:48.680]
About some guy on another radio station announcing that this is the first time he's going to do a contest on WIOD.

[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.620]
He aired.

[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:52.300]
What?

[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:53.100]
He aired.

[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.240]
I don't understand.

[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.360]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.220]
I'm mentioning a bond.

[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.140]
You're a radio station now, sir.

[00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.120]
Who?

[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:00.580]
Come on.

[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.020]
Two to six.

[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:03.980]
Yeah.

[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:09.220]
He said he's doing a contest for the first time on his new station WIOD.

[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:13.700]
Think about it.

[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.720]
We're thinking.

[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.460]
We're chewing and we're thinking WF-T-L.

[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.500]
He got to let me.

[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.300]
Oh, you mean Mr.

[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.500]
You're a pain, said that.

[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:24.680]
No.

[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:25.540]
No.

[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.400]
No, wait.

[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:29.200]
Wow.

[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.040]
It's 1128 at WF-T-L, at WIOD.

[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.440]
We need a lot more of those little pimple-headed kids to call in and make fools out of themselves.

[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:38.840]

[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.700]
And we'll trace those calls and find out what school they go to and on Monday, man.

[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.600]
They're going to just get beaten into a bloody pulp.

[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:49.380]
They look like survivors from some of those teenage horror high school movies, you know?

[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.060]
Let's go to Mayany Flakes.

[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.780]
I'm dying over here.

[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:54.440]
Week.

[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.420]
Week.

[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.220]
That wasn't the doc for anybody who hasn't tuned in for a while if you're off for holiday day.

[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.060]
That was not the doc.

[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.160]
That was like a cheap imitation except it not.

[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.000]
There's an opening in day, 751.

[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:07.900]
Kendall.

[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.280]
Yes.

[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.420]
Hello, Minion.

[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:11.000]
Yeah.

[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.100]
It's about time those dolphins sell out a game.

[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:14.760]
Yeah.

[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.380]
And about Monday night.

[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.240]
Butch up and use your real voice, okay?

[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.080]
Before you take your little stupid shot and go back to New York kind of bus, use your real voice.

[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:22.860]
And about Monday night.

[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.220]
Yeah, I wouldn't use it either.

[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.260]
I'd be embarrassed also.

[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.740]
The markets have nine and a half points.

[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:31.020]
When other people don't act the way you want them to, does it frustrate you?

[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.020]
Are you tired of the press writing stories that tell the whole truth about your incredibly

[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:36.900]
sorry life?

[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.620]
Want to know a great way to get back at all those scumbags?

[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.660]
Well now you can, at the Abe Hersfield School of really disgusting behavior.

[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.000]
Learn the fine art of totally ignoring people.

[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.300]
Excuse me, sir.

[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.240]
What kind of salad dressing would you like?

[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.980]
Sir, what dressing would you like on your salad?

[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.140]
Sir.

[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:04.260]
Get helpful hints from the master of rude on how to act like an asshole to almost everyone you meet.

[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.860]
Mr. Hershfield, I've heard so much about...

[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.120]
Oh!

[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.100]
Hey, wait a minute!

[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:16.380]
At the Abe Hershfield School of really disgusting behavior, you'll also learn direct from the master of the disgustingly obnoxious.

[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:21.540]
The fine art of harking up a big greasy clam right on the face of unsuspecting reporters.

[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.260]
Just think how much fun you'll have watching a huge flamboyle running down the face of some too-bid low-life reporter.

[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:35.520]
Act now, and you'll also receive the Abe Hershfield book on how not to sell valuable property in eight seconds or less.

[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:42.020]
Yes, you too can be really disgusting when you attend the Abe Hershfield School of really disgusting behavior.

[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.580]
And roll now for classes that start in just a few short weeks.

[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.660]
Sorry, sensitive kind, respectful human beings need not apply.

[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.160]
Maybe you could throw that spinner for the cups next year, right?

[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:06.200]
Here's the diddy about a bitty in my city not as old as dirt, but she sure is pretty.

[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:10.880]
Oh, I tell you, it's quite a pity, livin' on a loan on social security.

[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.340]
She's not acting, it's a true setup.

[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.620]
Walkin' by the door in her brand new get-up.

[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.740]
She trips, she falls, she tries to call.

[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.040]
I fall and I can't get up.

[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.880]
I fall and I can't get up.

[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.160]
Yo, man, didn't I see you in one turn?

[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.380]
Oh, man, you had no idea.

[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.900]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, me and the crew used to polo that blew her.

[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.640]
And now she's not allowed to dance.

[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.880]
They drove her away in an amber lamp.

[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.620]
Make a get commercial, speakin' bit-buck-sup.

[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.680]
I fall and I can't get up.

[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.780]
I fall and I can't get up.

[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.320]
Well, we're having a little chat in here.

[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:50.800]
George just relax, it's holiday.

[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.320]
Just have a little party.

[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.400]
11.53 at W.O.D.

[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.080]
What's more important, my eating or a being on the ear, okay?

[00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.000]
That's what Henry said.

[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.540]
My drinkin' or being on the ear.

[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:01.420]
Poppano.

[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:03.980]
Is that the click?

[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.000]
I don't hear the click.

[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.200]
Oh, there it is.

[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.100]
Okay, thank God.

[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:09.440]
North Miami.

[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:10.940]
Happy holidays, Neil.

[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.520]
Happy Hanukkah to you, too, sir.

[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.220]
I have three poop scoops, little ones.

[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.700]
Okay, you wanna hear them?

[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.060]
Yeah, I thought I had something to do with Jeff's new dog.

[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.400]
He was just tell me about his puppy.

[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.860]
No, that's what I think that's what they found on Rick Weaver's chair after the game.

[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.220]
Could be.

[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.680]
He did say that, by the way.

[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.700]
I wanna reiterate again.

[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:31.480]
He did say that.

[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:32.480]
He did?

[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.660]
Did you hear the tape on it?

[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.900]
I don't know, but I mean, it just got too many ear witnesses.

[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:41.600]
He said the 73,000 people, the largest crowd ever to see the dolphins lose.

[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:42.300]
He said it.

[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.780]
Well, the epicent of Hyatt, he can call people names.

[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:45.600]
He said it.

[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:50.960]
I am very upset about the way he's been talking about the dolphins.

[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.440]
But this past Monday, when I went to the game, as with the tailgate party,

[00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:00.560]
I had the chance to have a TV radio with me.

[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.540]
So I listened to ABC instead of having to put up with Rick Weaver.

[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.580]
Well, he sure took a lot of heat this season.

[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.260]
Well, you know, the guys got problems with the show.

[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.680]
And the server would have mixed it up with business.

[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.640]
Exactly, that's true.

[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:15.360]
That is true.

[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.700]
That's you got a very valid point.

[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:17.320]
Yeah.

[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:22.860]
Anyways, Muhammad Ali is going to Saudi Arabia to talk to Saddam Husqar.

[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.260]
Good.

[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.180]
Stick him in the desert.

[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.860]
And also Bill Wyman.

[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.700]
And you know, he was dating that girl that he got married to from the Rolling Stones.

[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:31.460]
Good horse.

[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.480]
Bill Wyman, he was dating her when she was 13 years old.

[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:35.660]
Yeah.

[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.920]
Well, it's all over now, as Mick Jagger would say.

[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:39.080]
Yeah.

[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:45.020]
And all of a sudden, last but not least, our favorite guy in the United States, Kweil,

[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:50.660]
is donating his old glove to the Little League Museum in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.

[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:51.320]
Yeah.

[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.180]
His glove is very much like his head.

[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.960]
They both have a big hole in the middle.

[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:01.740]
Well, it's been a definitely great pressure listening to you and keep up the

[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:02.300]
excellent show.

[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.380]
The pressure is all mine.

[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.060]
Okay, thank you.

[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:04.580]
Have a great day.

[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:16.740]
Oh, wait, have we have Sandy on the line?

[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:18.220]
Sandy.

[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:18.740]
Hi.

[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.780]
You're not going away, are you?

[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:20.680]
No, last day.

[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.480]
We'll get to you.

[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:21.980]
Okay.

[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.220]
Because you're a celebrity now.

[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:23.620]
Okay.

[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.200]
You sure you're going to hold on?

[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:36.460]
Sandy.

[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.100]
Yes.

[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.300]
You sure you're going to hold on now?

[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.980]
I'll only hold on for you, Neil.

[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:40.540]
Wow.

[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:41.740]
Not too tight.

[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:48.400]
It's an asshole celebration and they're all out on the street.

[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.660]
See them on the sidewalk.

[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.260]
Oh, here they're shopping at the feet.

[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:58.060]
That's 40,000 assholes doing an asshole from the maid.

[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.180]
Step aside and good at people.

[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.480]
There's the assholes on the parade.

[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.400]
We've got the assholes for freedom.

[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.740]
The assholes for fun.

[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.100]
The assholes for Jesus.

[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.520]
The assholes for guns.

[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.880]
The assholes for justice.

[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.300]
The assholes for crime.

[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.680]
The assholes for asshole.

[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.180]
The assholes for all time.

[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.960]
We've got assholes making money.

[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.420]
We're making all the rules.

[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.940]
We're taking all our jobs.

[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.260]
We're filling up our schools.

[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.520]
The assholes on the water.

[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.680]
The assholes on the sky.

[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.180]
The signs are such hell wanted.

[00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.600]
The assholes need to fly.

[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:11.520]
Oh, teacher, won't you tell me?

[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.560]
Have I really made the grade?

[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:20.720]
Am I held my class or am I just another asshole on the parade?

[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.580]
The assholes get the orders.

[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.980]
The assholes get elected.

[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.440]
The assholes get the vote.

[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.460]
I want to start a fun battle.

[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.220]
The assholes never die.

[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.140]
They just lay in bed and multiply.

[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.360]
The assholes in the morning.

[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.640]
The assholes every night.

[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.080]
The assholes are letting.

[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.500]
The assholes get the praise.

[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.060]
The assholes get the praise.

[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:19.960]
The assholes from the land.

[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.660]
The assholes get the sight good people.

[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.920]
The assholes on the parade.

[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:41.800]
Well, and people are starving, right, Sandy?

[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.440]
Right, listen to me.

[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:47.400]
We got a whole cheese pie here that nobody's even touched yet in a half of a pepperoni from Jeff.

[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.140]
Hey, you guys are peeing out over there, aren't you?

[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:55.140]
And some white hots and some hot sauce and a whole bunch of eggplant parmesan and a couple of garlic rolls left.

[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:56.540]
How was your turkey yesterday?

[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:57.440]
It was outstanding.

[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.380]
Your mom ate it.

[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.540]
My mom of course got an empire kosher turkey the best.

[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.400]
Oh, great.

[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:07.920]
And made this incredible herbal, herbal almond stuffing.

[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:10.940]
Great cranberries.

[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:11.200]

[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.420]
Well, I got to find out from her what kind of cramps you buy in the store.

[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.160]
Is that like frozen, Sandy?

[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:16.940]
What?

[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.140]
When you get cranberries?

[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.200]
I think so.

[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:20.480]
Or you come in a can.

[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.660]
No, I'm not talking about...

[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.740]
Oh, yeah, even the mashed up kind coming in a can, too, don't I?

[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:25.560]
Yeah, they're all canned.

[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:26.340]
Are they?

[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:26.940]
Yeah, they're making so.

[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.360]
Oh, these were incredible.

[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.320]
You know what?

[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:33.860]
I don't want people to start to talk and say I'm totally chronic, but I have a reason for calling to them.

[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:34.780]
Sandy, you can call.

[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:41.600]
And you and Bobby can call any day you want because you are celebrities, you are stars, we've converted you.

[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.020]
It's almost like with Laura converting.

[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:44.920]
Thank you.

[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.060]
Well, listen, my brother-in-law, he's in town today.

[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:52.060]
Okay, and he's leaving Monday, so he's listening to you today because I'm making him.

[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.760]
Yeah, and what does he say so far?

[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.760]
Well, his name is Ernie, and he likes Steve Kane.

[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.320]
Oh, no!

[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.060]
And I make him stay here.

[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:03.880]
You don't believe me.

[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.040]
Yeah.

[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.920]
So I told him you have to listen to Neil today.

[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.080]
No, Steve Kane.

[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:12.900]
First of all, you can't get it in day because you need a proper poster which we don't have.

[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:13.360]
Exactly.

[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.880]
Maybe he's got a pacemaker.

[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:16.720]
You could stick his stick in there if I work.

[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.460]
That's right, and second I told him I promised him I was going to call him a douchebag on the radio.

[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:22.540]
What a slime ball.

[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.360]
So this one goes out to my brother-in-law.

[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:24.860]
Yeah.

[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.500]
So Neil, that's what I really called for today.

[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.460]
Tell him to put it in this pipe and smoke it.

[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.020]
I will.

[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.160]
Where's Cory going?

[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.620]
Cory just zoomed up out of that chair and took off like a bat and heat.

[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.060]
Well, you're doing it, Neil.

[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:37.820]
You're number one.

[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.500]
We are doing it, Sandy, and you're number one and one half.

[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.100]
Yeah.

[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.780]
And Bobby is one and three quarters.

[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.620]
Bobby is a turkey. He's working today.

[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:45.160]
Really?

[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.780]
Yeah, I got today off, so I'm not risking my job today by calling you.

[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.640]
Well, you're a great American, Sandy.

[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.740]
Have a wonderful weekend and kick your-what is he your brother-in-law?

[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:54.520]
Brother-in-law.

[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.080]
Brother-in-law, brother-in-law.

[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.480]
Kick his ass out of there.

[00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:58.020]
I will.

[00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.760]
Stick him out in the middle of I-75.

[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:01.520]
We'll speed it up on the way home.

[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:02.900]
I'm afraid.

[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:03.680]
Have a great day.

[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:04.360]
Love you.

[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:04.580]
Bye.

[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:07.240]
Well, markets up 10 points.

[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:08.560]
The food is fantastic.

[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.820]
From Wayne Arnold at Arnold's Royal Castle.

[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:16.500]
At 125th in Northwest 7th Avenue right off the 125th Street Exit of I-95.

[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.580]
And the pizza loft in Jeff Cohen, one of the great Americans in history,

[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.320]
who blew all that money on that stupid stuff on the game.

[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:26.180]
You gotta go to pizza loft this weekend and help them make that money back,

[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.200]
so we'll have plenty of money to buy a Hanukkah gift, okay?

[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:29.980]
Like for me.

[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:31.700]
1215.

[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.800]
Or W-Y-O-D, where the food fest continues.

[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.820]
Boy, I haven't eaten that much.

[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:38.740]
I have?

[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.060]
Yeah, I have.

[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:40.900]
I had eggplant.

[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.840]
I had four Neely burgers.

[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:45.560]
Four.

[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:46.700]
Well, that's not much.

[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.420]
Two slices of pizza and a little sliver.

[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:57.700]
That's it.

[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.260]
I'm finished for today, okay?

[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.080]
That's it for me.

[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.280]
Although there's a...

[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.720]
We'll save the White Hots for suds.

[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.260]
What do we got to...

[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:04.780]
Oh, look at that.

[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.480]
Two big ones.

[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.920]
We're up to our long distance dedication.

[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:13.300]
And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand.

[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.440]
Whether we have kids or pets or neither.

[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.200]
It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio, and here's what he likes.

[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:23.520]
Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request,

[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.980]
but I'm quite sincere, and it'll meet a lot if you play it.

[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.460]
Recently, there was a death in our family.

[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:32.220]
He was a little dog named Snuggles,

[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:35.080]
but he was most certainly a part of us come start again.

[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.320]
From coming out of the record.

[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.560]
Play the record, okay?

[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:40.520]
Please.

[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.700]
See, when you come out of those up-tempo damn numbers,

[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.960]
man, it's impossible to make those transitions.

[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.260]
And then you've got to go into somebody dying.

[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.340]
You know, they do this to me all the time.

[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.640]
I don't know what the hell they do it for, but damn it.

[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.300]
If we can't come out of a slow record, I don't understand it.

[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.360]
Is down on the phone?

[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:01.400]
Okay.

[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.640]
I want a damn concerted effort to come out of a record

[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.540]
that isn't a f***ing up-tempo record.

[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.180]
Every time I do a damn death dedication.

[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:15.100]
Now, make it, and I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week.

[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.840]
It's a god-lass f***ing damn time.

[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:22.000]
I want somebody who's a f***ing brain to not come out of a f***ing damn record.

[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.620]
That's up-tempo, and I got to talk about a f***ing tour of dying.

[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.040]
Boy, this f***ing ponderous, man.

[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.860]
Ponderous f***ing ponderous.

[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.100]
Rose and Barbie, it's all she can.

[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:40.140]
Can't fit in the melancholy band.

[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:44.240]
So Rose and Barbie doll looks and acts just like the TV pig.

[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.000]
Just pull her strand of spaghetti.

[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:51.380]
I never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, ever, ever, ever.

[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:54.380]
And look what happens when you press her little fat belly.

[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.000]
Rose and Barbie, it's all she can.

[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:04.100]
Can't fit in the melancholy band.

[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.140]
The new Rose and Barbie doll.

[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.040]
Can't carry it so separately.

[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:13.160]
Say her back, your favorite Jewish rock and roll nostalgia band.

[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:17.860]
It's Russia, Shanana with their greatest hits album, Sakaapathasinigag.

[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:22.000]
My whereby's back is gonna super-send my baby.

[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:25.540]
Or my, or my, my whereby's back.

[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:31.860]
Yes, Russia, Shanana is reformed to bring you 12 kosher cuts of hoppin Hebrew hygiene.

[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:39.480]
That joy is a good for you.

[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.920]
This album should be in every orthodox rocker's collection.

[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.060]
Rolling Stone gives it five stars of David.

[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:53.460]
If I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, who wrote the book of Job?

[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.220]
Sakaapathasinigag, new from Russia, Shanana, available in all record stores.

[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.660]
We'll talk twice when you get here.

[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.540]
Don't pass over this album.

[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:03.920]
The heat.

[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.020]
Okay, it's 12.40.

[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.460]
There are two open lines in Broward.

[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:08.840]
Look at that.

[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.500]
I think that's the first time that's happened since a week ago, Sukers.

[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.200]
I'm Ted Couple.

[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.240]
And this is Punchline.

[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:24.980]
There's been a major breakthrough in the science of male contraception.

[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.560]
ABC's Barbara Walters has more.

[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:33.320]
Ted, I'm here at the University of Louisville, laboratory with Dr. Richard Robinson

[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.000]
who's invented a new birth control pill for men.

[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.380]
Dr. what is this pill, Joe?

[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.620]
Well, it's actually very simple, Barbara.

[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.580]
A man puts it in a shoe and it makes him limp.

[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.060]
Ted?

[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:50.100]
Tomorrow night we cross a praying mantis with a termite

[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:53.720]
and get an insect that says grace before it eats your house.

[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:58.860]
I'm Ted Couple and this is Punchline.

[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.480]
We land, the zoo is flat.

[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.500]
Up and minus zero, it's a war.

[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.840]
Scary tales can come true.

[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:19.620]
It can happen to you if you're Gary Hart.

[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:26.960]
While the white is away in the townhouse you'll play.

[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:31.240]
If you're Gary Hart.

[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:37.340]
A big price you'll pay if with women you play.

[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.860]
Not once, it was twice.

[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.140]
You were caught with misrised.

[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.840]
You're really not too smart.

[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:52.640]
If you can't stay apart now you won't be president.

[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.960]
Gary Hart.

[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.860]
You won't be the president, no.

[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.860]
Gary Hart.

[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.580]
What a shame, eh?

[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.560]
126 at WIOD.

[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.980]
The Palm Beach Line is just sitting there waiting for you to do it.

[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.860]
655-9463-655.

[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:18.800]
WIOD.

[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.680]
Okay, I'd plunge at least a thousand on this one, right Phil?

[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.520]
Absolutely, maybe two thousand.

[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.060]
There you go.

[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.160]
I can't believe what a great call for the post that was.

[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.800]
We got it together now.

[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.880]
We're not going to just do a flock this year.

[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.280]
We're going to give you the big presentation.

[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:31.840]
Absolutely.

[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.600]
Well, I'm ready if you are pal.

[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.160]
You picked Marissa's knife, right?

[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.440]
In the third race, what is that kid's first name?

[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:37.800]
Alpha.

[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:38.620]
Jose.

[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:38.960]
Jose Alpha.

[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:40.700]
Jose, can you see?

[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:41.200]
Right.

[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:42.760]
All right, here we go.

[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.720]
There's a quarter of a mile to go.

[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:45.480]
They turned for home.

[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.240]
They went to half and 46 and three.

[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.440]
And Marissa's knife opens up with two lanes.

[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:51.780]
Please, that fire missed toward the inside.

[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.220]
Is second with lovely visions.

[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:54.980]
It's back to Randy's Liberty.

[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.580]
Then comes Tika's star looking for him toward the inside.

[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.000]
North spurs to his neck and then shy little girl.

[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:01.600]
They move past the eighth pole.

[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.420]
Marissa's knife extends her lead to four.

[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.260]
Tika's star toward the inside.

[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:07.260]
Now comes on second.

[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.980]
Link to that back to step fire, Mr.

[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:10.980]
then North spurs with lovely vision.

[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.700]
A 16-a-mile to come.

[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:16.040]
Jose Alpha res is driving over old noise today.

[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.400]
Marissa's knife draws off by herself.

[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.400]
Tika's star second is North spurs.

[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.300]
Comes on third.

[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.580]
They come to the wire.

[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.220]
And Marissa's knife, the Neil Roger's special.

[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:26.700]
She wins it by four.

[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:30.260]
Tika's star at distance second with North spurs.

[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:30.760]
Third.

[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:31.840]
Incredible.

[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:32.960]
Incredible.

[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.280]
And six eighty Neil.

[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:35.520]
Hey, I'll take it.

[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.120]
That's a six dollar horse on Monday.

[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.860]
And the six eighty today or whatever day that was Tuesday.

[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:40.460]
Yeah.

[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:41.860]
And six eighty today.

[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:42.560]
Right.

[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:43.240]
One day.

[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.460]
And what a rate of respon your loss for the weekend.

[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.660]
Two out of three in our first picks, right?

[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:48.340]
Not too bad.

[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:48.960]
And this one.

[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:50.340]
And amazingly, I usually look,

[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.940]
Dirk Ackerman's got the greatest entries.

[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.580]
And he picked her fourth, whether I told you.

[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.220]
But I saw Alpha res at six to one.

[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.240]
I forget there's a good shot.

[00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:57.020]
Absolutely.

[00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:58.820]
And this kid can ride.

[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.060]
She can and she ran a hell of a race today.

[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.020]
Evidently.

[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:03.880]
Why are the wire?

[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.500]
I'd bet at least a thousand.

[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:07.960]
And now the guy, see, this is what's going to confuse these people.

[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.280]
I was going to say I'm holding back on them and I really know something.

[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:15.300]
So on Tuesday, when we pick next, he'll want to go out and put 500 on a horse I pick.

[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.660]
So I'm going to pick a real stiff on Tuesday.

[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:18.800]
Oh my god.

[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:19.620]
No, don't say that.

[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:20.700]
No, I'll do my best.

[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:21.520]
I always do my best.

[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.860]
You did very, very well the last time we did these.

[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:24.180]
Yeah.

[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:24.660]
Now listen.

[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:26.700]
That's right.

[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:27.840]
It goes to show you.

[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.400]
Now I want to go in no racing form.

[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.860]
I just take the paper, pick a name.

[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:33.860]
I was going to start having a racing form sent over to you.

[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.640]
No, hey, that'll kill it.

[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.420]
Now listen, swirling funnel.

[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:39.040]
Remember I told you the guy called in yesterday?

[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:39.700]
Right.

[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.500]
But the more I reflect on it, I think he called after 11 o'clock.

[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:44.000]
Uh-huh.

[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:48.320]
So the race was already over and we forgot about it because you had that extra early post yesterday.

[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.880]
So I have a feeling he might have just had the post.

[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:51.580]
Yeah.

[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.260]
Yeah, I think so too.

[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.280]
And they're one of those after the race experts.

[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:56.000]
Right.

[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.040]
You know, anyone can do that.

[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.340]
But let's say that you did it before the race.

[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:01.800]
Yes, by 20 minutes.

[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:02.220]
Right.

[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.660]
So anyway, look, I hope you have a great weekend.

[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:06.180]
You too.

[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:08.480]
And how was Thanksgiving, by the way?

[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.520]
Thanksgiving was fine.

[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.580]
I mean, maybe I did it.

[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:11.300]
Oh, the best.

[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:12.040]
You betcha.

[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.120]
All right, panel, listen, have a great weekend.

[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.720]
And I guess I'll talk to you on Tuesday.

[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:17.220]
Okay.

[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.320]
All right, take care.

[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:18.760]
See you, Phil.

[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:19.060]
Bye.

[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:19.380]
Bye.

[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.040]
How about that?

[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.440]
Draw it drawing off and winning all alone.

[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.120]
Marissa's night with Alvarez.

[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.480]
I told you, 680.

[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:35.060]
Anyway, here he goes sliding the microphone over again.

[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.740]
Ladies and gentlemen, a man who is desperate to speak to the world.

[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:38.580]
How's your neighbor doing?

[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:40.220]
He sucks.

[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:40.940]
Okay.

[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.380]
Can you eat?

[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:44.060]
You ate in a big turkey, I say, right?

[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:45.620]
I didn't eat a lot yesterday.

[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.960]
No, I had Thanksgiving dinner, but I didn't go crazy at all.

[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:49.260]
No.

[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:49.680]
No.

[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.760]
Very, very judicious.

[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.260]
We did eat that we picked out today.

[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:54.960]
I noticed.

[00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:58.280]
I'm doing fine.

[00:45:58.460 --> 00:45:59.200]
Why do I look fat?

[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:00.440]
You all of a sudden look like you lost weight.

[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.180]
I think I'm lost.

[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:01.920]
Yes, I have.

[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.760]
I've lost back about six or seven pounds.

[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:05.960]
I'm almost back to where my lower point was.

[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.060]
I still have a little way to go.

[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.020]
I'm not doing so bad.

[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.740]
I just couldn't think of eating today.

[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.300]
In fact, this shirt is way too big.

[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.320]
I'm starting to wear bigger shirts, so I look even slimmer.

[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:15.520]
You what?

[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.420]
Well, yeah, because you picked out yesterday.

[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:18.060]
You cheated.

[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:18.780]
You went off.

[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.020]
You went off the deep end.

[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.980]
He's wearing his deep ends today.

[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:23.180]
He's wearing deep ends yesterday.

[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:23.980]
Oh, boy.

[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:25.340]
Well, you know that's not real.

[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.940]
You know that that'll even out over the weekend once you get back on a straight narrow path.

[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.060]
But Monday you'll look like Elaine.

[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:32.460]
Anna Rexic.

[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:36.060]
Boy, she is so hysterical for Cory and her.

[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:39.340]
She was just crawling on the floor and clawing at the helium tank there.

[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.600]
Look at the other scars on that tank there.

[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:42.080]
Man.

[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:43.660]
Anything.

[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:48.060]
She said she would just give millions to just get anywhere near his body just for a little

[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:48.620]
a feel.

[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.040]
He's way too young for that.

[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:50.580]
Exactly.

[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:51.980]
He's under 100.

[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:53.300]
Miami.

[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:54.500]
Hey, Neil.

[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:55.080]
Yes, sir.

[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.680]
What's the name of that record store that has all the Uncle Bond's I records?

[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:00.760]
Blue note.

[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:01.520]
Blue note.

[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:02.700]
It's North Miami Beach.

[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.740]
163rd right next to a peaches as a matter of fact.

[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:06.880]
Oh, okay.

[00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:07.320]
All right.

[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.120]
I think I know where that is.

[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:11.380]
Can you handle that right across from the 163rd Street Mall?

[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.040]
Okay.

[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.700]
I'm going to give a presentation on Tuesday on censorship.

[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:15.360]
Yeah.

[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:18.960]
And I'm going to talk about you and how your WIOD got slapped with a fine.

[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:19.400]
Right.

[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.720]
So in class, I'm going to play the song.

[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:22.360]
Uh-oh.

[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.760]
Not in Broward.

[00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:25.100]
Oh, no, that's why you.

[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.240]
Oh, thank God.

[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:27.620]
Not a BCC.

[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:28.840]
No way.

[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.080]
El Sherriff would have you in a whose gal in no time, man?

[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:33.200]
You and Luther.

[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:34.120]
Yep.

[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:34.960]
Okay.

[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.860]
Anything you want to say for the record store the class?

[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:38.540]
Get a life.

[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:39.360]
To defend yourself.

[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.240]
Get a life.

[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:41.500]
See you.

[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.280]
That's what they're going to say to you.

[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:42.700]
Okay.

[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:43.620]
Thank you.

[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:43.780]
Bye.

[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.720]
147th to defend myself to FIU.

[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.780]
I mean, are you kidding, sir?

[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.360]
Speak at the English and butcher up.

[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:52.620]
That's all I can say to that guy.

[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:53.900]
And just remember to have an application.

[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.820]
You're guilty until proven innocent.

[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.380]
That's what Johnny Dark found out.

[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:58.360]
He is guilty.

[00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:00.060]
His neighbor is a slime ball.

[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.600]
His neighbor is going to spend 20 years in Arcadia.

[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.600]
Norman Kent's going to have him put away for life.

[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:07.400]
Right?

[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.480]
I thought the Nazis were gone.

[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.860]
I mean, I just didn't realize that they were still in existence.

[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:14.520]
Foolish me.

[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.400]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:18.540]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.160]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:24.160]

[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:24.160]

[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:24.760]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:25.220]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:26.140]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:27.460]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:28.600]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:29.280]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.820]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.460]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:35.360]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:40.100]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.820]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:43.260]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:44.440]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:44.440]

[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:44.440]

[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:44.440]

[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:44.440]

[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:44.440]

[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:44.460]
I'm going to say.

[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:44.460]

[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:44.460]

[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:44.500]
