[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.500]
You're not necessarily those of the station.

[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.440]
Now, here's Neil Rogers, a new sought radio 610 WIOD.

[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.340]
I'm a Cub fan and a Bud fan and I trust you are too.

[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.600]
This is the NBC Radio Network. I'm Mike Anthony.

[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.420]
Sometimes I feel that life is passing me by.

[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.940]
Sometimes I feel that people don't want to smile.

[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.920]
But when I listen to your show, you make me smile like a shy.

[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.420]
And you can tell me that by my friend, Mick O'Leary on my radio.

[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.020]
Mick O'Leary on my radio.

[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.140]
But yeah, Henry's still, well, Henry's already my baby.

[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.040]
Okay, Bill Cobbers here, we're gonna have to do the show.

[00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.060]
We've only got two hours today. We've got a lot of spots to get in.

[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.620]
Which of course is the main reason we're here.

[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.000]
Nice little hot job on the end of that record, of course.

[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.700]
And we got 48 versions of that.

[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.480]
So he had a little tired just letting me know I'll pop one in there.

[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.040]
And I brought you a new one today too.

[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.880]
Which we're gonna, oh yeah.

[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.140]
Well, you don't have to play it, man.

[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.780]
We're not all of it.

[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.620]
There's a little gift.

[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.660]
There's a little good memory.

[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.680]
You wear geeks bearing gifts.

[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.800]
That's what I've always said.

[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.260]
Exactly.

[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.540]
Well, sometimes I feel this is the boss.

[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.660]
Like life is passing me by.

[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.000]
Yeah, it sounds like Disney.

[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.920]
Anyway, Bill Cobbers here, he's got some great stories to tell.

[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.700]
He's gonna rip QAM a new ass.

[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.920]
Aren't you?

[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.200]
Listen, right?

[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.780]
He's gonna show you people who think you just Mr. Mello,

[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.000]
that underneath Vanir is Carson Renny used to say.

[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.200]
There's a vicious, nasty, back-fighting, wonderful guy.

[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.640]
And also Bill Cosper, I guess, while the luck again,

[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.440]
is Nick showing up today or what?

[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.680]
Because Nick's gonna have to call Cosper and tell him no way Jose.

[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.580]
Sorry.

[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.660]
We just have the toughest time connected with that Van Cosper, you know what?

[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.220]
It's fate.

[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.480]
Are you gonna introduce me or to what?

[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.180]
Well, I mean to call it.

[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.980]
You're a little like a Hanukkah boy station.

[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.580]
If you are.

[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.720]
First of all, you're people don't know who I am.

[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.440]
The first call is gonna be, hello.

[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.680]
Bill, I'll be this stupid.

[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.580]
What? Trust me.

[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.440]
Hello?

[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.500]
W-I-O-D.

[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.340]
Hello.

[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.260]
Yes.

[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.140]
Hello.

[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.140]

[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.540]
Hello.

[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.200]
Hello.

[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.200]

[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.200]

[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.200]

[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.200]

[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.200]

[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.200]

[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.200]

[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.060]
It's the heart, lady.

[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.800]
It is?

[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.400]
Don't harp on it.

[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.360]
Everyone, it's a day.

[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.400]
Is that it?

[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.020]
That's it.

[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.740]
Thank you.

[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.100]
Bye-bye.

[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.980]
She's so emotional she didn't want to talk to you.

[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.680]
W-I-O-D.

[00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.380]
Yes.

[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.600]
How about...

[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.980]
Hold on, sir.

[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.120]
W-I-O-D.

[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.980]
The Bill Culver Show.

[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.720]
I'll bill you so well.

[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.120]
Hold on, ma'am.

[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.640]
See, I told you that was Randy Martin throwing the Royce.

[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.660]
That was it, Randy Martin.

[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.540]
Mike Melody.

[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.300]
Mike Knight.

[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.320]
So anyway, Jay Michael starts over there pretty soon, I guess.

[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.100]
W-I-O-D.

[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.840]
Okay.

[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.760]
Blind checker.

[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.180]
Fowler.

[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.300]
Good.

[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.580]
That's your buddy, Lee Fowler.

[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.700]
And I'd like to say a little few people this morning, Thomas.

[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.060]

[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.920]
You've got a minute.

[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.480]
I have a minute?

[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.740]
That's more than anybody ever gets on the show.

[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.340]
That's true.

[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.480]
No.

[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.520]
I'm not only ruptured.

[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.180]
I want to say a little to all my doctors.

[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.020]
But I'm not going to give their last name.

[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.080]
Okay?

[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.540]
Yeah.

[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.740]
I want to say hello to Frederick and all of the people.

[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.040]
I want to say hello to Mike.

[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.480]
I want to say hello to...

[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.900]
Yeah, I don't know.

[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.300]
This isn't Wheel of Fortune, you know.

[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.300]
This is...

[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.360]
Well, I just want to say...

[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.120]
And of course, my dear friend, Sandy, my physical therapist, who's helping me dance again.

[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.120]
And he leads at this point in time, Andy Payton.

[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.160]
And you know, I just want to say a little...

[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.480]
They mean about her as their big Sandy Payton fans in this building.

[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.180]
How used to work here with her?

[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.840]
I love that bitch.

[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.260]
Anyway, introduce me.

[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.800]
I'm not going to introduce you to all of the directors in the band.

[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.700]
I'm Andy Balejian.

[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.880]
Andy Balejian.

[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.900]
We've only got two hours.

[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.180]
We've got the Keynes game in noon.

[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.100]
They're playing the Citadel.

[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.360]
And then if Miami wins, which we know they will, at four o'clock, they'll have a second game.

[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.560]
This could be my life show.

[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.800]
WIOJs are praying that the Keynes win today, that they suddenly became big ball game baseball fans.

[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:34.900]
This could be my life show.

[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.100]
WIOJs.

[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.420]
Mine is...

[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.260]
I just said that before.

[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.180]
As little note, my bot says, be sure in...

[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.400]
And also food, I made sure the food comes at 11.

[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.380]
Oh great.

[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.700]
From American Stake and Pizza.

[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.380]
So whatever you want, and Melvin, and just to help yourself, and we don't want to force it on you.

[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.760]
Okay.

[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.980]
And also, if Mommy's listening, and I see...

[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.740]
We leave it noon.

[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.200]
I'm taking you home and dropping you like in a sidewalk.

[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.260]
And then I was going to go right to Mommy's for an early lunch, but I forgot my pill.

[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.000]
Okay.

[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.220]
And when you're old and alien like we are, if you don't have a pill man, you can't even move.

[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.220]
You have no movement.

[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.200]
That's my problem recently.

[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.900]
No movement.

[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.960]
So I'm going to exactly...

[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.540]
So I'm going to have to go home, all the way home, up to plantation and back to Mommy's around.

[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.940]
I don't know.

[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.220]
I'll get there what I feel like at Mom.

[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.300]
West Palm Beach.

[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.240]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.260]
I'm the bill caller show.

[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.240]
I'm WIOJs.

[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.900]
Don't say that.

[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.260]
You antagonize your audience.

[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.800]
Yes sir.

[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.960]
I'm antagonized.

[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.140]
You know who this is sir?

[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.040]
This could be your Roger.

[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.720]
No, I mean who is sitting in the seat.

[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.960]
I have no idea who Bill Caller is.

[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.380]
Exactly.

[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.580]
I thought they named the racetrack after him.

[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.100]
Yes you do.

[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.740]
No, I really don't.

[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.180]
Don't you?

[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.660]
No.

[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.260]
I'll get lost.

[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.060]
No, I don't want to talk to people.

[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.600]
Don't over you.

[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.040]
Are we voting?

[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.020]
Yes, we can't.

[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.080]
There's only four or five people listening to your show.

[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.980]
We're esteemed from Hollywood, WIOJs.

[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:45.300]
Marvin?

[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.240]
Yes.

[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.160]
Bobby.

[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.260]
Bobby.

[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.000]
Yes.

[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.700]
Oh, it's the Guava Goose Bay.

[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.720]
What do you...

[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.020]
He can tie...

[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.240]
Yes, I can tie.

[00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.060]
Yeah.

[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.960]
Okay.

[00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.500]
Hold on.

[00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.600]
But you know who Bill Caller is?

[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.660]
I can't help Bill Caller.

[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.760]
You sound like one is listening.

[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.400]
Hold on Bobby.

[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.440]
WIOJs.

[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.680]
I'll keep it up.

[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.200]
Keep it up.

[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.960]
I'll let you say hello to Bill Caller.

[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.180]
Sure.

[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.680]
Hold on please.

[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.000]
Okay.

[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.640]
You bet.

[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.460]
Okay, they're all ready for your bill.

[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.900]
You go right down the line, don't you?

[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.660]
I don't want you to run.

[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.960]
What do you mean I'm running out of four calls?

[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.200]
Seven.

[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.220]
This is in a big time like QAM or Q410 line.

[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.780]
And literally speaking of QAM, I have a good idea that my...

[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.420]
QAM...

[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.680]
Knight.

[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.460]
WIOJs.

[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.600]
Oh yeah, like the whole football.

[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.080]
Motor please.

[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.580]
Sure, hold on.

[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.780]
Who might night?

[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.740]
No, I have a...

[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.600]
I have a feeling...

[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.320]
He hates me, by the way.

[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.420]
I have a feeling that Bob McKay is taping this.

[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.100]
Oh.

[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:44.480]
Orders from higher up to make sure that if I say anything, you know, that they consume me

[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.940]
for over there, that they have it on tape.

[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.720]
That's what the Bill Vines thought, too.

[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.300]
Oh, he don't want to bring that up.

[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.180]
Anyway, it's 12 minutes.

[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.040]
I hate to interrupt you, but we've got to do the melting pot.

[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.400]
We don't have a lot of time today.

[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.480]
And if we don't work out great, this is going to go by so fast you ought to come back

[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.060]
and do it again.

[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.300]
You and I have been paid at the melting pot.

[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.620]
How about Saturday, 10 to 2?

[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:02.460]
How about that?

[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.360]
Huh?

[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.080]
Everybody in the building says, hey, good idea.

[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.700]
You know, good.

[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.260]
No good.

[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.100]
Slime ball.

[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.500]
I go to the track, so you don't.

[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.860]
Anyway, we have eaten at the melting pot as a matter of fact.

[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.060]
And now they've got something new.

[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.560]
They've got the great cheese fondues.

[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.800]
Okay, let's take some of these calls.

[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.520]
If we don't have a lot of time, we can't...

[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.520]
But before we take the first call, you must tell.

[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.100]
Now, people call, well, when's Bill coming back on here?

[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.220]
Is he going to be on another station?

[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:32.160]
And I mentioned a couple weeks ago that he was talking to another station in the market.

[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.200]
I say station very loosely.

[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.520]
And it didn't pan out because they wanted to pay any money.

[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.460]
And the station of course was WFTL, which might as well be off the air, basically.

[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:42.760]
And...

[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.100]
Well, they were the first person to call me.

[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.300]
But they had...

[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.800]
They were the only person to call me.

[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:53.360]
You've got to envision big time radio in the owner, King Paul, who of course is the maven of used cars and all that crap.

[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.720]
And they invite they'll call it a breakfast.

[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.800]
They have all a hot shows.

[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:05.780]
They've got the owner of the station and the program director and the operations manager and the janitor and all these people at breakfast at Denny's.

[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.040]
And I was...

[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.340]
My appetite is great.

[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.000]
Okay, I think you're making this up.

[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.800]
It's a no-no-serious.

[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.360]
And my appetite is great, right?

[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:24.620]
And the only thing I could say is there was a time not too long ago when I wasn't eating very much.

[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.500]
And now I'm eating like I'm just like a horse.

[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.520]
Anyway, to make a long story short, because I know you have a lot of calls.

[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.780]
We meet at Denny's and everybody's there.

[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:41.000]
The manager, the program director, a girl who's like the operations manager and King Paul is there.

[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.480]
And I told my wife, no cereal this morning, nothing.

[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:45.920]
I'm going to pick out.

[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.780]
We're going to get a free breakfast.

[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.860]
Well, we go to Denny's.

[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.320]
I meet the all-comman.

[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.800]
Here comes King Paul looking great with his dayglow leisure suit on and everything.

[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.420]
And I'm going to eat, right?

[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.800]
So they start with King Paul and they say, the waitress said, we like to order.

[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.000]
He says, um...

[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.760]
What can it toast, dear?

[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.500]
She's well we have rye, we have a little toast.

[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.600]
You go to the general manager.

[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:18.700]
That's a good one.

[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.240]
I'm some toast.

[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:25.020]
I pick a little toast and maybe a couple slice of bacon, but toast.

[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.180]
We go around the table, everybody has shows.

[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.000]
I'm starving.

[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.960]
And I ordered nothing.

[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.320]
You have no backbone.

[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.680]
Oh, God's incredible.

[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.240]
You know, you get the feeling that like King Paul had a $5 bill in his pocket.

[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.000]
There were like six people sitting at the table.

[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.000]
Oh, that was fun.

[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.660]
You wanted to make sure that it came like four.

[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.720]
And I was hungry.

[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.140]
I mean, I was...

[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:48.580]
I was like...

[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.560]
What did he give me an idea of what the offer was going to be?

[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.160]
Coconut grove.

[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:52.780]
Oh, hi.

[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.340]
Good morning.

[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:53.840]
Yes, sir.

[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.720]
I hope you have the widespread TV in the studio.

[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.480]
We have MTV on.

[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.720]
We will not turn on C-spec.

[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.620]
I tried to get him to turn it on, sorry.

[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.340]
What did you do?

[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.420]
I was going to have a three TV here and he still won't fit.

[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:06.900]
Exactly.

[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.780]
We have just a little Sony in here and there's no way she's going to...

[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.600]
Maybe her pupicle beat on airs about it.

[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.640]
I couldn't handle it at this time.

[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.580]
Why is it on her face, Maggie?

[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:15.340]
Exactly.

[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.860]
Okay, guys, have fun.

[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.080]
Okay, W-Y-O-D.

[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.320]
I want to talk to Bill, please.

[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.460]
The bill called her show.

[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:20.640]

[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.360]
I want to talk to Bill.

[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.180]
Okay, hold on.

[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:23.920]
You know what that is.

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.620]
Mr. Depression.

[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.540]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.420]
Yeah, I want to speak to Neil.

[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.440]
Neil?

[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:30.940]
Yeah, Neil Rogers.

[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:31.560]
Oh, sure.

[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:32.880]
Hello.

[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:35.640]
Hello.

[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.300]
Hello?

[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:37.640]
Sir?

[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.280]
Hello.

[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:38.820]
Yeah.

[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.300]
This is Bill.

[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.720]
Bill Cola?

[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:42.840]
Yeah.

[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.000]
Hey, Bill.

[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:44.780]
Montana here.

[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.580]
Montana, how you doing, kid?

[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:46.940]
Right.

[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.180]
Why is he a voice again, Bill?

[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.040]
Well, it's good for me to hear it, too.

[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.540]
I haven't spoken in three months.

[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.300]
Well, I hope we get you on another station very, very soon.

[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.060]
Well, I'm running out of stations here as Joe...

[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.140]
It's Abernathy.

[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.720]
Joe Abernathy once said,

[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.560]
I'm Mike Ampeningham.

[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.500]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:05.960]
Now, listen.

[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.540]
It's good to talk to you.

[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.520]
Okay, Bill.

[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.520]
Okay, take care.

[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:10.780]
Okay, Bill.

[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:11.940]
I'm on an off-fast on the show.

[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:12.780]
We don't want you around.

[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.500]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.240]
Hello.

[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.340]
Tom Beach.

[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:17.920]
Here with it.

[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:18.700]
Get lost.

[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:19.580]
Miami.

[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:20.520]
Neil.

[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.220]
Yes, sir.

[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:21.500]
Hello.

[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.120]
How are you?

[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:22.540]
Great.

[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:23.440]
How you doing?

[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.300]
Good to hear you again.

[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.060]
Thanks a lot.

[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.260]
Listen, Neil, I make it short and sweet.

[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.960]
This is Tom from Miami.

[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.460]
I'm the one to give you your cup tape up at the bizarre.

[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.220]
Yes, Tom.

[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.600]
Neil, I'm not messing with you tomorrow morning.

[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.660]
I am on my flight.

[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.020]
I am going to Chicago-based ball haven.

[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.220]
That's a bad news for Tom.

[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.060]
Bad news for Tom.

[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.100]
Mike Harkies on the 15-day disabled list.

[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.300]
The 30-nighters in New York, they took him on the fifth inning

[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.240]
and they brought up Kevin Blankenship from the minor leagues

[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.020]
who will start tonight against the Giants

[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.000]
so don't get your hopes up.

[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.520]
I'll be there tomorrow, Neil.

[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.800]
I'll be there for Tomara's game at two o'clock.

[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.800]
We don't even have a pitcher for Tomara's game.

[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.980]
Well, don't be there, at least.

[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.820]
Don't want to still be thrown out of that game.

[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.240]
And by the way, the ball was spared by five feet yesterday.

[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.860]
I want to go into a big thing about that.

[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.460]
The Cubs telecast cut it beautifully.

[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.820]
They showed it over and over again.

[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.820]
They put a circle around the ball as it left the park.

[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.360]
Right.

[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.560]
Fair by five feet.

[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.920]
Harry Wendell said is the biggest piece of crap

[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.980]
whoever stepped out of a baseball diamond, okay?

[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.940]
Well, you take a long time with baseball calls.

[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.360]
You know why?

[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.500]
It might not be as bad as everyone said.

[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.000]
Right.

[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.320]
Neil, listen to me, please.

[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.460]
But you know something, the highlight.

[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.440]
If anybody saw that game because it wasn't he has been,

[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.780]
the highlight is when Zimmer goes nuts.

[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.620]
That's what's the price of admission.

[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:33.380]
He is the best.

[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.860]
Eyes go popping out of his head.

[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:35.700]
He's the best.

[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:36.080]
Neil.

[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.240]
And you could read the lips too.

[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.620]
And he's wearing his hair shorts.

[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.620]
Yeah, I like that.

[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.440]
He got that Bob Cox here to.

[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.060]
Yes.

[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.700]
Neil, listen, I'll be there for the Cubs and Sanford.

[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.920]
He only said that to me.

[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:46.800]
Already said it.

[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.680]
I have my video camera in hand that a friend of mine has.

[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.900]
He knows which is he really is.

[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.660]
I'm not coming in these old ladies for you about calls.

[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.720]
Sir, what's the bottom line in your calls?

[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.140]
Carson Renny was right.

[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.540]
The first line is that I'm a Chicago baseball knight.

[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:01.440]
And I'm going there.

[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.360]
I live here in Miami.

[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.880]
We don't get to see professional baseball in person.

[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:05.760]
Are you kidding?

[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.500]
You haven't been over to Danny Maduro Stadium?

[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.920]
No, no, no, Bill.

[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.120]
I don't go over there.

[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.000]
You know, twenty-thirty years ago when I was born here,

[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.320]
yeah, we used to go over and watch you.

[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:19.660]
Okay, sir.

[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.360]
Have a wonderful trip.

[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.040]
Neil, I will.

[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:21.820]
I'm going to get here.

[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.720]
I don't say it all over again.

[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.700]
Say you're going to take your camera to Chicago.

[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:26.120]
I do.

[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:27.040]
See you, Frank.

[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.340]
Okay, get a while.

[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.360]
Okay, twenty-one past ten at WIOD.

[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.880]
The Cains in the Citadel, sunny in Joe,

[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.900]
from a mark-light stadium in noon today,

[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.040]
and then hopefully, man, we all got our fingers and legs crossed

[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.760]
if they win the first game, then they get into the championship game at four.

[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.360]
And of course, we'll have that here on your sports obsessive station, WIOD.

[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.420]
You know what Zagaki?

[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.240]
You know him at all?

[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.820]
I know Joe very well.

[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.200]
As a matter of fact, can I tell you a quick story about Joe five seconds?

[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:52.540]

[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.380]
That's about all he can do on him.

[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:55.440]
No, seriously.

[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.660]
When I left here, when we all got bounced out for the jet copter,

[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.880]
you don't remember that.

[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.360]
Yes, I did.

[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.880]
Anyway, we all got bounced out for the jet copter,

[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.320]
and Joe is a lot better.

[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.100]
I got to tell you this, but publicly,

[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.400]
Joseph Gack on the WIOD.

[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:11.640]
Hello.

[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:12.200]
Hold on.

[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.100]
Okay, go ahead.

[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.540]
I got to get, listen, he and me.

[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:15.520]
Hey, this is Boni.

[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.140]
Are you crazy?

[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.800]
Joseph Gackie is one of the few people who called me up and said,

[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.520]
I'm sorry, what happened with that classic exchange of luck.

[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.200]
Anyway, 22 after 10 at WIOD,

[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.140]
Char Hut is doing it, boy.

[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.320]
If you're living cram going every my own sweet time.

[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.620]
All right, hey, listen to me.

[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.040]
I was just trying to help you out there, guy.

[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:34.520]
I know.

[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.700]
So this night to your bill, where he has come out of?

[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.120]
A shell.

[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.640]
Sounds like he's been up for a while.

[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.020]
Do you have any idea who he is?

[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.640]
Sure, he's the guy that named the racetrack after him.

[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:47.960]
Exactly.

[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.520]
Okay, let's go to Fort Lauderdale.

[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.000]
Oh, man.

[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:53.460]
Oh, hold on.

[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:53.780]
Okay.

[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.700]
Oh, gee, do we have to put him on so soon?

[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.940]
I'll let him wait there on three.

[00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.240]
Bobby.

[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:00.600]
Oh, Bill.

[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:01.600]
How are you?

[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.600]
I'm like the last one.

[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.740]
I have missed you and missed you.

[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:05.920]
I was in Texas.

[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.020]
My husband called me and said,

[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.220]
Bill, callers going to be on and I came home a day early.

[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.980]
I brought more pecan,

[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.660]
so when you're in good health and ready for pecan pies,

[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.480]
with the little flags, they'll be ready for you.

[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.120]
In the meantime, I'll take more of everyone,

[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.240]
more of those minutes to pecan pie later.

[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:24.700]
Yeah.

[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.720]
And you're truly missed, honey.

[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:27.680]
You really are.

[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.940]
And we're so prayed so hard and we're so good.

[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.400]
And Neil, that you're both feeding better.

[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.740]
You're both, and I'm on the Neil Maus since you're going.

[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.060]
You're on the Neil?

[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:38.900]
Yeah.

[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.700]
We heard, yeah.

[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:41.280]
Yeah.

[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.820]
And say hello to your mom.

[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.260]
I've always ever, too, is just to see you.

[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:46.660]
Got on your ground.

[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.360]
Who builds mom?

[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.860]
She's not feeling too well today,

[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.080]
but I'll say hi to her anyway.

[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.800]
Okay, do you have one you good brown shoes?

[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.220]
Who?

[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:53.800]
You.

[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:54.300]
Neil.

[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:54.780]
Yeah.

[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.040]
Okay, because mom likes you to wear the good brown shoes.

[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.440]
They were black when I came into building,

[00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.600]
but coming through the hall here,

[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.580]
they give brown real fancy.

[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.400]
Okay, real good.

[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:01.980]
Okay, Bobby.

[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.300]
I've got plenty of pecan pies when you get back.

[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.260]
Okay, see you, Bobby.

[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:05.980]
Okay, see you, Bobby.

[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:06.340]
Bye.

[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.960]
Nice talking to you, Bobby.

[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.500]
Bye.

[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:13.100]
Do I feel, do I feel, do I feel, day, day, day,

[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.220]
although not we're so tall.

[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.900]
Soимся no te說, you know.

New happy graduation!

[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:36.480]

[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.400]
Somebody's got to keep this alive.

[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.180]
Oh, you know,

[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.260]
never do I OD.

[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.000]
Hello.

[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:44.140]
Hello.

[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:44.680]
Yes.

[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.740]
I'd like to say hello to the CEO.

[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.740]
Okay, you're on right now, sir.

[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.800]
Oh, my goodness, right through.

[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:52.540]
My no bill.

[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:54.400]
Hi, ho.

[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:55.660]
Welcome back, guy.

[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:56.860]
Hey, thanks a lot.

[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.480]
I know who this is.

[00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.840]
Bill, I, I understand QAM.

[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.580]
Did Walt Disney buy QAM?

[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:02.680]
Did one?

[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.240]
Walt Disney buy QAM?

[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.240]
Walt Disney?

[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.520]
I heard it was a real Mickey Mouse operation.

[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.580]
Now listen, I'm not going to trash QAM.

[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:15.360]
I put the corn flakes on the table for me until I couldn't get into the studio.

[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.840]
I'll thank him for that.

[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.200]
Yeah, I'll give you that nice, certified letter that said,

[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.380]
we're sorry, you're not feeling well and don't ever come back.

[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.480]
I'll never forget that meeting when I said, I can't do it.

[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.180]
I can't do it.

[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.920]
And one of them said,

[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.140]
if you got a two, could you do it?

[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.620]
It is.

[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:34.840]
It's true.

[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:35.660]
We haven't talked.

[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.720]
Yeah, I'm on the good.

[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.300]
All hard.

[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.660]
I said, I can't do it.

[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.300]
I couldn't do it for $100,000 a year a minute.

[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.540]
And maybe for a half hour.

[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.360]
What have you got a two?

[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.880]
And that tells a lot about this business.

[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:49.260]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.180]
What's this like here?

[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.540]
I mean, there are a lot of people in this building still think that I had a hang nail.

[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.100]
They don't understand.

[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:54.740]
I had a stroke.

[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:59.040]
They think, oh, it's five, six weeks ago, and we'll run him over here and run him around like a maniac.

[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.240]
They don't understand, boy, these things take time.

[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:01.800]
They're nuts.

[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:02.920]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:03.560]
It's true.

[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.580]
You know, let's get all the people to bring the food in again.

[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.600]
They're out of their minds.

[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.060]
Over there.

[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:07.600]
And nuts.

[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.340]
What kind of food coming?

[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.160]
I'd like some toast.

[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:10.840]
Not a lot of it.

[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.980]
King Paul is going to be bringing it in personal.

[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.160]
I called you in Neil.

[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.120]
Just a you in Neil.

[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.140]
Just a toast to you.

[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.240]
Hey, it's great to hear your voice.

[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:18.820]
Who really is?

[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:19.760]
Well, good guy.

[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.800]
He's a piano player in a cat house up in Bocawreitz.

[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.140]
You got that right.

[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.040]
No, he's a piano player.

[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.020]
He's a real good guy.

[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.320]
And he's nice to call.

[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.200]
I appreciate it.

[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.180]
Welcome back.

[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:32.780]
Thanks for the lunch.

[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.520]
How do I sound?

[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.160]
Great.

[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:35.920]
Honest.

[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.740]
Listen, you've been on a roller coaster thing and you know, you sound terrific.

[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.040]
Okay.

[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:42.460]
Okay.

[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:43.600]
Good job.

[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:44.580]
Thank you.

[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.120]
Roller coaster.

[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.200]
Okay, we have an open line in Broward, one in Bocaw.

[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:48.880]
I just mentioned that.

[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.060]
We haven't given any numbers out yet.

[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.260]
And we probably shouldn't have to.

[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.400]
Is this a mobile again?

[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:53.360]
Can I speak to Mike?

[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.020]
Mike?

[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.380]
Isn't that Mike Miller?

[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.440]
Mike Miller is here.

[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:56.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.540]
What kind of soda are you drinking?

[00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:59.640]
Oh, it's just diet.

[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:00.780]
Diet cherry?

[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.640]
It's just the radio show.

[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.160]
That's correct.

[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.680]
Bill, how you feel?

[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.020]
It's not.

[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.560]
You feel a real good, just wonderful.

[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.120]
That's fantastic to hear.

[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.920]
So, when you take an overstand slot at night, did I say that?

[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:12.480]
Sorry.

[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.580]
Boy, that was your audience's vicious.

[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:17.520]

[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.780]
Hey, just ask Alex Bennett what Neil's audience can do.

[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:21.940]
Did I say that?

[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:22.360]
Sorry.

[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.180]
Yes, you sure did.

[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.440]
I don't want to get that.

[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.080]
That's what brain me for it all again, right?

[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.940]
Just like when Joey gets cancer, I mean, trust me.

[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:35.440]
Can you play a medley of the bill calls or hits at some time today?

[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.040]
I think I can make for the whole audience.

[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.300]
I say we want to hear it.

[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:43.860]
Well, that's the same deal.

[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.220]
Don't play a role on the phone, those are calling phones.

[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.740]
Wait, but this is for you, though, sir.

[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.360]
Don't take it first, I want to.

[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.200]
I don't think I feel myself.

[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.880]
1031 at W.I.A.

[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.620]
Jose and we'll see another time like Don't Call Us, we'll call you.

[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.240]
It just never works out.

[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.180]
I think fate has a lot to do with that.

[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.700]
You know, that's over at the hero where they still think the hurricane's lost that game two nights ago.

[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:12.960]
But nobody told them.

[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.240]
We got the kids coming up at noon, and I want to remind you of that.

[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.320]
But in the meantime, we want a lot of people to go over there because the cash is corded by fast.

[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:24.040]
Last time we came in a summer shining, blue skies looks like the weatherman's going to cooperate.

[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.180]
Soap or was smiling, or is that something unusual?

[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.040]
So we're going to be in a big crowd over there at Mark Height Stadium.

[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.500]
Can I interrupt you for a second?

[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.000]
I'm even bigger crowd listening because it's on my time slot in Rick and Puss.

[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:35.920]
What is it?

[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:42.180]
Somebody asked me to please tell the story about how you and I met and how you can...

[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.360]
Oh, it's no good?

[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.480]
15 years ago.

[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.960]
Yeah, 15 years ago.

[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.040]
And you have to look the same.

[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.880]
If you went out in the sun for a couple hours, got a little color, you'd look exactly the same.

[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:53.200]
Honest to God, yeah.

[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.140]
Look at me, I looked better.

[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.020]
You look no, not really because when I first met you, I was skinny, I'd lost no your arms.

[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.200]
No, you lost it after you met me.

[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.560]
After I was in limbo, I was like, I wait about what I do now.

[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.120]
Neil Rogers had a lime green jacket.

[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.320]
I did not have a lime green jacket.

[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.280]
Bill Toulin got me a lime green jacket on the trade-out in Palm Beach.

[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.460]
Right, and Turing.

[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.580]
And he used to wear a lime green suit.

[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:26.380]
I'll never forget the day we were playing in a Pro-Am golf tournament and I was writing with Bill Toul, the general manager.

[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.720]
He had a great attitude, another great human being.

[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:29.040]

[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.780]
And we're sitting in a golf area off school of management.

[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:39.660]
We're sitting in a golf cart waiting to hit the ball and he looks over at me and hear all these celebrities and people playing golf and everything.

[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.620]
He says, what are we doing here?

[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.620]
Oh, like he was beneath him.

[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.440]
I'll never forget that.

[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:57.520]
Yeah, are you working selling radio equipment or business, billvines and my company, Joe Abernathy, Bill Toul?

[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.800]
Or when you bite the hand that feeds you, you wind up his guest on this show.

[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:02.460]
The Casper.

[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.800]
Poor Lauderdale.

[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:09.380]
Bill saved us from the two defeats, but load.

[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.320]
Okay, let's go to a celebrity caller on three.

[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.080]
Yeah, good morning, Uncle Neil.

[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.420]
How are you doing?

[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.080]
Gilbert.

[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.560]
Yeah, what's the say?

[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.100]
How you doing, Gilbert?

[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.080]
Oh, fine.

[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.680]
I miss you so badly.

[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.700]
Failure made by say by coming on the program.

[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.440]
Thank you very much, Gilbert.

[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:28.820]
It's good to talk to you.

[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:34.800]
Yeah, and happy luck when I was talking with you and Uncle Neil when I was in your seat like that.

[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:35.840]
Happy talk to Randy.

[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.180]
Yeah, it's about a fact that I had to be talking to Ernie.

[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.780]
Yeah, well, I mean, I had to be called Alice.

[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.280]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:45.940]
How about Debbie?

[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.780]
How about Paul Isle?

[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.380]
Yeah, I spoke to Paul Isle.

[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.020]
I'll be on the East Bend right now with Debbie.

[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.660]
You can be a national star, Gilbert.

[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.760]
Yeah, I saw him feel and I'm watching.

[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.340]
How did she look?

[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.160]
You had a big screen?

[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.800]
Oh, yeah, she's really great.

[00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.460]
Yeah.

[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.740]
And then he has to see if he's a true character.

[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.800]
I like the very tip of morning radio.

[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.240]
Yeah, it's about a fact.

[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.760]
I saw Larry Kent since like, loving.

[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.960]
They did a lot of things.

[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.560]
That was great.

[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:09.620]
That was great.

[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:10.000]
I was very quiet.

[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.280]
He was very quiet.

[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.180]
He wasn't able to do it.

[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.260]
Oh, I saw him yesterday.

[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.960]
How about Larry Kent?

[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:14.900]
Larry Kent, you'll be talking to him.

[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.080]
No, because he doesn't want this since I was right.

[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.260]
He doesn't have an 800 number.

[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.740]
He doesn't have a 500 number.

[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.880]
He collects when you call me 50s.

[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:24.180]

[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:24.720]
No.

[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:29.160]
And I wish Bill you were to be on night, believe me.

[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.620]
How about, let me ask you, Gilbert, how would you like to be on Saturday and WIOD

[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.480]
from 10 to 2?

[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.100]
Well, I picked out when you got a character.

[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.620]
Don't get me into trouble.

[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:38.940]
No.

[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.280]
I'm not going to use your drum.

[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.080]
Start out slow.

[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.260]
Start out with a weekend thing.

[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.380]
What I'm going to do.

[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:43.640]
Yeah.

[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.720]
I'm going to get out the Meg on Sunday and you have two days there.

[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.080]
No, no, no.

[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.040]
I would never come back to work here.

[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.400]
But so I am.

[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:53.840]
Different regime.

[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.960]
You could write in your memoirs if you worked for six different regimes at WIOD.

[00:23:59.040 --> 00:23:59.820]
Let me tell you something.

[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.640]
You said that before.

[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:05.500]
I came back to work here in Nick Fragoni with just at the, I have a cardiac arrest.

[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.420]
Well, you know what Dick Feral said about you.

[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.040]
Dick Feral.

[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:09.600]
Yeah.

[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.040]
Oh, no, Mark.

[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:11.300]
Yeah.

[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:11.960]
What did you do?

[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:12.200]
Yeah.

[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.020]
He said, you know, I really enjoy your show.

[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.580]
I guess there's no, no, no much coffee that anymore.

[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:16.780]

[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.660]
You can see how much color is for him in this market.

[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.220]
Who's sorry?

[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.400]
Well, let's say you've done a lot of fun, but I'm closing.

[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.980]
Oh, I'm going out.

[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:23.660]
Out west side.

[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.400]
I'm going out with Kevin for a month.

[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:27.180]
Yeah.

[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:32.840]
And also the team wanting to get my to cross Kevin and I should be on a Howard Blue show.

[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:33.400]
Okay.

[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.120]
And Howard H.

[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.160]
Show a WKJ.

[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:35.280]
Yeah.

[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:35.900]
Greg Gilbert.

[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.620]
I'll be listening.

[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:38.640]
I'll be on top.

[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:39.600]
Okay.

[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.000]
I'll see.

[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:40.580]
I'll see you.

[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.820]
And don't forget we'll be at the ballgame over next Tuesday.

[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.400]
We from today.

[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:43.760]
Yeah.

[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.480]
And also actually we both on the first day of the year.

[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.240]
It's going to be great.

[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:47.740]
Isn't that Gilbert?

[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:47.980]
Yeah.

[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:48.320]
Sure.

[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.680]
I'm going to hit you on that.

[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.360]
I'm going to hit you on that.

[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.200]
I'm going to be in a suitcase and drop you out of the plane.

[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:52.900]
Okay, Gilbert.

[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:53.120]
Yeah.

[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.980]
Kevin and I are going to party this tomorrow.

[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.380]
You're having a big kiss for me.

[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:56.380]

[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.560]
Great talk to me, Gilbert.

[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.180]
Okay, bye.

[00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:58.560]
Bye.

[00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:58.860]
Bye.

[00:24:58.980 --> 00:24:59.860]
You know, it's not too bad.

[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.880]
24 to 11, a WIrdee bill called us here.

[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.700]
We're going to be here on noon all day today.

[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.960]
We've got a short show.

[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.020]
We've got a short thing today.

[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.740]
And some of us are going to use to the course.

[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:10.920]
But we got the ballgame.

[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.420]
The Hurricanes and the Citadel.

[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.220]
It was Frank Galloway.

[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.060]
It was driving home yesterday and the name came back.

[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.040]
Well, it mean nothing to anybody.

[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.040]
Mark Baton pitched for me.

[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.920]
I mean, Frank Galloway for the Citadel in 78.

[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.800]
I think it was the first year that I was born.

[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.280]
And the game went 16 andnings.

[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:26.540]
Right.

[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.160]
And they won the Hurricanes.

[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:28.760]
They won the court.

[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:29.740]
One team scored a run.

[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.440]
You know what that is.

[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:31.260]
Did I get out of it?

[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.460]
Yeah, and another team scored a run.

[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:33.480]
That's generally the way it works.

[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.720]
Anyway, we're heading in this summer.

[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.160]
We're better time to make a resolution to lose that fat,

[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.720]
that excess glob that you, in fact, if you want to...

[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.040]
How could you do that to me?

[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:48.820]
I'm over there.

[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.580]
Don't we get C-span on this cable?

[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.020]
We do.

[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.140]
What number is it?

[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:54.860]
I can't get it.

[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.160]
I can't find it.

[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.840]
Okay, let's give some of these calls,

[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.240]
because we've got a lot of people calling.

[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.160]
We've got a short show today, wonder, a lot of pressure.

[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.020]
Bill Caulders here.

[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.640]
We want to make them look good, which won't be easy.

[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:04.580]
Miami Lakes.

[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.740]
Hi, I just want to say hi to Neil and to Bill.

[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:08.420]
Great.

[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.520]
It's great to hear your voice again, Bill.

[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.580]
And I would just let you know that I mailed you up

[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.360]
and to get well-carned after you left QAM.

[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.260]
I wonder if they ever forwarded your mail to you.

[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.100]
You're probably not.

[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.740]
You wonder if why?

[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.900]
If you ever got some of the mail that...

[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:23.780]
Oh, yeah, I got it all.

[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.320]
Oh, they...

[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.460]
Yeah, I got it all.

[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.120]
How about your cards?

[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.580]
Did they give those all back to you?

[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.160]
No, as a matter of fact, thanks.

[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:30.740]
Whoever might be listening.

[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.800]
If there's anybody listening,

[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.440]
it did send me a card or anything.

[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.240]
All right.

[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.320]
Did they concern that maybe you didn't get it?

[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.340]
No, no, no.

[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.860]
As a matter of fact, the hospital forwarded all my mail

[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.800]
to the Columbia School of Broadcasting.

[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.460]
The Columbia School.

[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.520]
What about QAM, though?

[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.400]
Yeah, she said she was going to bring your mail over to you, did she?

[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.040]
Did what?

[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.520]
We sent it to QAM.

[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:56.520]
Did we...

[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:57.180]
Yeah.

[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.780]
As a matter of fact, Steve Raity,

[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:03.520]
who also did not bring me my card of...

[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.040]
You depressed me,

[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.180]
was kind enough to drop by and bring me my mail.

[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.720]
He's a great guy and I'm...

[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.860]
I'm miss working with him.

[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.340]
He's a delightful fellow.

[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.300]
Okay. Well, you are sorely missed.

[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.120]
And I just hope that we'll hear you run a steady basis, Bernie.

[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.300]
Well, don't forget Saturdays, 10 to 2 on WIOD.

[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.760]
Right. Saturdays, 10 to 2.

[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.740]
Okay. Have a nice day.

[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.020]
Okay.

[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.180]
Just a little bit.

[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.520]
You depressed me.

[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:37.460]
Say I'm right and then you always second-guess me.

[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.420]
But I can't believe it.

[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.100]
I don't write a white friend.

[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.160]
Hollywood is not on the phone yet. WIOD.

[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:43.420]
Sometime.

[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.200]
Hold on. WIOD.

[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.220]
Okay. Line checker on the book.

[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.480]
That's Fowler. Believe me.

[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.420]
Trust me, sits at home with that sharp finger.

[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:51.900]
This says Hollywood.

[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.180]
It could be. Hello.

[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.680]
Hello. Hello. Hello.

[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:55.620]
Welcome back, Bill.

[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:56.980]
Thank you very much, sir.

[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.440]
Well, you're quite welcome, sir.

[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.420]
As a truth, you're going to be on 10 to 2 on Saturdays and then...

[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.440]
Don't start this.

[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.960]
And I came in here today just to find out if I could

[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.460]
sit up straight for two hours.

[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.780]
You look pretty good so far and he sounds great.

[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.900]
He would be good on Saturday.

[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.000]
If I slide ball off here, then we'd get Russ O'Ace's off here.

[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.040]
Let him go do some of those screaming car spots.

[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:17.760]
Get off the air.

[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.260]
You notice Steve, you notice how I've become a pawn once again.

[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.160]
And not Steve.

[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.500]
Yes, it is.

[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.580]
It is?

[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.960]
I'm on a good phone for a change.

[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.460]
I didn't recognize the voice.

[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:27.960]
You're kidding.

[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.200]
That's what you're nearly usually do.

[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.100]
I easily do.

[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.220]
There's one thing that Steve...

[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:36.380]
One thing Steve can do that will always identify him to you.

[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:37.940]
Uh-oh. What's that?

[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:38.460]
Stutter.

[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:39.620]
Yeah.

[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.760]
Well, he's still listening to that guy we had on the afternoon.

[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.820]
Well, I know when I played golf with Billy Kayleigh, he used to kiss you that all the time.

[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.200]
And then he gave you a guy to bathe in the back.

[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:49.720]
Well, you're so damn hyper, Steve.

[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.800]
If you just be here, I'm feeling like me and relax.

[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:57.660]
Yeah, he got me so intimidated on the golf course by saying that about my bop bop bop bop bop.

[00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:57.900]
Exactly.

[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.040]
I never beat the guy.

[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.880]
I played him quite a few times and he always ends up winning.

[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:02.880]
It's too chill.

[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.240]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.160]
Is this he's fancy?

[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.080]
He looks pretty good there.

[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.140]
Oh, that was a big mousse and elk.

[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.500]
Well, I don't want to take a bloody time, and then you have a short time.

[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.060]
I just relax a second.

[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.800]
We're trying to find Debbie on the C-SPAN here, and we can't find her.

[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.140]
What channel is it supposed to be?

[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:16.980]
Ten?

[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.340]
Now we took it off.

[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.300]
We don't want to see that crap.

[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.720]
Okay, just give me back my MTV on 16 in Quetz-Gruinerama.

[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.480]
But Melissa and Steve, it's been really something you haven't started once.

[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.980]
What channel is C-SPAN at your house, Steve?

[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.080]
I don't even know.

[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:31.620]
I'm not my start.

[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.240]
I'm pushing friends.

[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.160]
But listen, let me just say one quick thing for you.

[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:34.580]
Here we go.

[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.160]
Here we go.

[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:35.480]
Here we go.

[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:35.580]
Here we go.

[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:35.720]

[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.680]
Here we go.

[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.780]
Here we go.

[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.100]
Here we go.

[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.100]

[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.100]

[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.100]

[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.100]

[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.100]

[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.100]

[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.100]

[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.100]

[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.100]

[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.100]

[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.100]

[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.100]

[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.100]

[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:52.240]
Here we go.

[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.180]
Here we go.

[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:53.180]

[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:53.320]
Here we go.

[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:53.560]
Here we go.

[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.620]
Here we go.

[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:54.640]
Here we go.

[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:55.860]
Here we go.

[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.560]
Here we go.

[00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:01.660]
Here we go.

[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:02.920]
Here we go.

[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.480]
Here we go.

[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:05.560]
Here we go.

[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:06.680]
Here we go.

[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:18.640]
Here we go.

[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:18.640]

[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:18.900]
Here we go.

[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.020]
Here we go.

[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:19.120]
Here we go.

[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:19.120]

[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:19.260]
Here we go.

[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:19.320]
Here we go.

[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:19.600]
Here we go.

[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:19.720]
Here we go.

Here we go.

[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.500]
There is a show about possible cause the

[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:07.500]

[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.520]

[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.380]

So she would make you smile like a child, so well company.

[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:29.720]

Sometimes I feel like life has me by

[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:06.060]
sometimes I feel like people don't want to smile.

[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.140]
Oh, it is the new show.

[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.220]
The color on the radio.

[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.260]
The maridio.

[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.600]
You don't realize how many brains we have in there?

[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.140]
What's your name?

[00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:02.600]
What's your name?

Okay hold on. W-I-O-D.

[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.340]
I talked to Bill.

[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.180]
You bet.

[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.220]
One hold on. Please.

[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:32.300]
Okay, some of you are in life so one of your people. Mobile.

[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.600]
This is me.

[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.100]
Meal. Yes sir.

[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.100]
You want to keep listening on the radio?

[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:44.580]
No, I'm here.

[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:45.320]
I'm here. I'm here.

[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:46.980]
Right up to the ball game to the first pitch.

[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:47.420]
You're right.

[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.920]
I got a couple of recruits in the car.

[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:51.540]
Yes.

[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.020]
Could you do me a favor?

[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:53.680]
What's that?

[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.560]
Is this a request?

[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:55.940]
No, I'm kind of.

[00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.520]
You're not a Spartan alumni though.

[00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:58.380]
I thought you could do a form.

[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.580]
A Spartan alumni?

[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:00.120]
Yes.

[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.140]
How's that?

[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.340]
Oh, no I got...

[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:07.600]
What do you want to hear?

[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.020]
I got two young kids in the car room.

[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.480]
What? Are you going to get in the trunk?

[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.180]
No, there's one driving.

[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.420]
Oh. What other?

[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:14.980]
But 12?

[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.100]
Are you leaving from Joey's house?

[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.040]
They're like 18.

[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:18.640]
Okay.

[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.420]
And I'm trying to get them to listen to you show.

[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.680]
Great. Well, what do you mean they don't know who I am?

[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.800]
Long just introducing them to them.

[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.740]
Oh my god. What are they?

[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.620]
A couple of douchebags?

[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.240]
Yeah, they're cuss line balls.

[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:27.900]
Yeah.

[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.760]
Mung brains is called or would say?

[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:31.820]
Yeah, could you play the Wayne's bump ball?

[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:33.400]
Oh, jeez!

[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.340]
We got a big heavy duty guest here and you want to hear that crap?

[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.380]
Yeah, just one time.

[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.180]
No chance.

[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:40.540]
Oh, can you play it?

[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:41.300]
What else can you play it?

[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.500]
You can't get your best car then.

[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.780]
Give them a little taste.

[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.000]
Pick out any car you want.

[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:45.660]
Pick this.

[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:46.920]
Okay, thanks, man.

[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:47.680]
Have a great life.

[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.080]
Oh my god.

[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.480]
See, he's first of all, he's full of crap.

[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:51.660]
He don't have anybody in the car.

[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.100]
These people are creative.

[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.780]
I'll see that they come up with more ways to try to con you

[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:56.960]
in a plane at symbol crap.

[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.540]
And actually they work for Dennis Collins.

[00:34:58.780 --> 00:34:59.500]
So they're not fooling me.

[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.160]
It's a 1048 at WIOD.

[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.860]
There's one of the cockiest people in the history of broadcasting

[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.180]
and they're now with a big smirk on his face.

[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.780]
Five runs in the bottom of the knife and in the last

[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.600]
sort of is impaling himself with uncooked spaghetti right now.

[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.040]
I can't believe it.

[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.760]
Mr. Pirate in there, Chuck Meyer.

[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:16.880]
You know how Chuck Meyer did.

[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.920]
No, I've never met him.

[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.040]
He's a great fan of it, too.

[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.420]
A great newsman, Miss Guy, baseball fan.

[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.300]
Very bad city of person.

[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.860]
Chuck Bill Caltor, CLV ER.

[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.120]
He's doing King Paul the Saturday, Dead or Alive

[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.660]
on the Saturday morning show.

[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.340]
Would you like some toast for every toast?

[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.000]
I don't know, sir.

[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.460]
In fact, after the show we're all heading out to Ctobia

[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.020]
to toast at this game Boulevard.

[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.440]
Now the toast.

[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:39.860]
Toast.

[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:39.920]

[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:40.940]
Don't you remember the toast?

[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.020]
Oh my God.

[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:42.920]
Yeah, a shame.

[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:43.740]
Yeah, a shame.

[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.680]
And mother, things to buy time, as a matter of fact,

[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.280]
that was Larry Kent's account.

[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.220]
Was it really?

[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.480]
A monster account.

[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:51.860]
Yeah.

[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:53.740]
Anyway, would you stop it?

[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:54.600]
It's 1049.

[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:55.820]
Carson Renny was right.

[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.740]
You're vicious and disgusting and backed by any other party.

[00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.260]
No, I'm not.

[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.740]
Even here for all these old ladies.

[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.800]
He's a vicious douchebag.

[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.760]
Anyway, let's talk about shells right now.

[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.120]
May we either celebrate in the long and royal day weekend,

[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.020]
which is still like kind of simmering over,

[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:10.800]
because it's Tuesday.

[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.200]
And tonight would be Lomston Night anyway.

[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.860]
I was going to play that burp vendors,

[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.540]
but we don't have time.

[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.600]
We'll do it after the news, okay?

[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:17.740]
Remember Pines.

[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:18.940]
Bonin, Bill.

[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:19.840]
How are you?

[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.780]
So nice to hear you voice again.

[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.060]
Thank you so much, sir.

[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.140]
You're talking about me or Neil?

[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.300]
I'm talking about you.

[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:25.780]
Wow.

[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.080]
You can hear me anytime.

[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:27.840]
You've ever voiced?

[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.300]
Probably not.

[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.180]
My name is Buck.

[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:31.200]
Chuck?

[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:31.900]
No.

[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.040]
With a beat.

[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:33.720]
Cluck.

[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.000]
No, with a beat.

[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:35.980]
Victor?

[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:38.300]
Buck.

[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.480]
Anyhow, it's so good to hear you voice again.

[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.360]
Thanks a lot, Buck.

[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:42.480]
I'm hoping that you'll be back.

[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.520]
It's a QAM listener.

[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.020]
Yeah.

[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:44.620]
Hey, Buck.

[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.060]
All the QAM people are named Buck or Cluck.

[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.500]
Well, whatever.

[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.360]
As long as, well, just watch your articulation and stuff.

[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:51.540]

[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.120]
But some things you can't play on the radio.

[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.560]
There's a lot of things you can't say on the radio, sir.

[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.920]
And I'd like to take about five minutes and go to over all of them.

[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.040]
I'd like to salute a lot of people who have been instrumental.

[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.480]
In my downfall in this town.

[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:09.080]
I'd like to say what I really think, but I can't, sir.

[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:15.060]
You know, like us decorum is better than my company.

[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.440]
Can I ask you a question, please?

[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.520]
Did you ever move back into your house?

[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:19.760]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:20.660]
I'm back in my house.

[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.820]
Not only they move back in, but they've really done it up right.

[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.480]
Well, it looks great.

[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.400]
Oh, OK.

[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.020]
And I'm jealous.

[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.920]
I was there this morning for the first time in a while since they fixed it back up and looks great.

[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:31.500]
Oh, really?

[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.440]
Yeah, we did a lot.

[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:32.440]

[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:32.440]

[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:32.440]

[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.620]
I would've got that tenet out of there.

[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.040]
I lived right down the call, right down the street from you.

[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:36.880]
Really?

[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.120]
We'll stop by anytime.

[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:38.860]
Have some toast.

[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:39.480]
Yeah.

[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.060]
He's got some leftover from that big FT.

[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:42.520]
I'd breakfast.

[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:46.500]
I ride around on my bike hoping sometimes I see you're walking your doors.

[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:47.880]
Do you walk your doors around there?

[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.660]
Well, I haven't been walking them lately because if they pull a little too hard, you know.

[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.060]
But you are feeling better now.

[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:55.880]
Yeah, I feel great.

[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:56.540]
Just great.

[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:57.480]
How do I sound, Buck?

[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.400]
You sound great.

[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.060]
You sound terrific.

[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.020]
OK, you were sound a little bit puny before.

[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:03.380]
Yeah.

[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.420]
So puny.

[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:04.700]

[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:05.400]
That was thin.

[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:06.240]
Is that a good word?

[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:07.680]
Hey, Buck.

[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:08.280]
Yeah.

[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:09.160]
See ya.

[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:09.700]
Right.

[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:15.780]
1054, W.W.W., don't forget the hurricanes in the Citadel, sunny and Joe from Mark Light Stadium noon today.

[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.660]
And then hopefully we'll keep our legs crossed.

[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:24.280]
If a U.M. wins the first game, the championship game of the Atlantic Regional for the right to go back to Omaha at four o'clock for Omaha.

[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:24.800]
Man.

[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.060]
Ross is steakhouse and Mr. D.

[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:31.420]
See, players really, I mean, it's nice to be in the college world series, but nobody cares about that.

[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:37.960]
They want to go back out there and go to X-Car Band of the track and go to all those great steak houses and just a great place.

[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.420]
Really, even though there are a bunch of yahos out there, it's a great place.

[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.660]
West Palm Beach.

[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.320]
Hit my B.

[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:42.860]
Hit my B.

[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:43.360]
Hit my B.

[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:43.720]

[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:44.200]
Hit my B.

[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:44.260]
Hit my B.

[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:44.460]

[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:45.400]
Hit my B.

[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:45.760]
Hit my B.

[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.700]
Hit my B.

[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.080]
Hit my B.

[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.140]
Hit my B.

[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:56.060]
Hit my B.

[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:57.440]
Hit my B.

[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:57.440]

[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.020]
You can get all those d.

[00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.480]
You want, I'll start now.

[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.180]
You never guess who called me the other day.

[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:02.140]
Beware!

[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:07.360]
Yeah, he should call today because I didn't want to talk to him.

[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.080]
You would talk to him for a half hour.

[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:09.620]
Beware!

[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.600]
Isn't that incredible?

[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.040]
Has that been from the old days, when we had an audience at the ANC?

[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.640]
A pay phone in vodka.

[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:19.480]
Mr Rodgers and Mr Caulder, how are you today?

[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.200]
Frank from Scotland.

[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:23.560]
Yeah Frank.

[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:24.160]
How you doing?

[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:24.780]
Great.

[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.000]
Good, I want to sing that song.

[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.280]
You want to sing it?

[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:27.520]
Yep.

[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.240]
Which one you depressed me?

[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.820]
No, sometimes I feel.

[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:31.620]
Well just a minute.

[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.200]
I need a cheese, I don't know which one I...

[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.140]
Well let's try this one.

[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:35.500]
Here we go.

[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:37.000]
I'm ready to the guy who wrote that song.

[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.240]
He's called us.

[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:38.720]

[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:39.440]
I'm ready.

[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.220]
I'm ready.

[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:41.860]
I'm ready.

[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:42.280]
It's ready.

[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:43.080]
I'm ready.

[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:44.140]
I'm ready.

[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:45.180]
I'm ready.

[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.240]
Wait a minute.

[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:47.120]
Don't get ahead now.

[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:47.860]
I'm ready.

[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:48.480]
A guy.

[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.580]
A guy who wrote that song.

[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.280]
A guy who wrote that song.

[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.160]
A guy who wrote that song.

[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:57.680]
Wait a minute.

[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.920]
In the tube, in the rainbow.

[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.420]
You call it, all I want is this girl.

[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.100]
And I'm ready.

[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:10.720]
I'm ready.

[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.560]
You call me, you know.

[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.460]
I want to ask you one thing in closing.

[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:30.320]
But where is this pay phone that you're on?

[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.800]
I'm uh, no, because you're coming at me.

[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.120]
No, no, I'm serious.

[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:34.860]
Where are you?

[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.440]
In a shopping mall?

[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.340]
No, no, but I got guys.

[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:39.220]
Why?

[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:39.760]
Why do you ask?

[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.760]
No, because you're just thinking.

[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.360]
See, everybody's laughing, but the main reason I'm laughing is I envision like standing in

[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.700]
the middle of the Bokit Town Center.

[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.960]
Well, not everything holds my nose.

[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:48.500]
Oh.

[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:50.580]
Doing this and they're laughing too.

[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.660]
Well, everybody here was holding their nose and they were saying, well, you're a Bokit

[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:54.300]
we can understand.

[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.260]
And it's the call, then.

[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:55.960]
Yes, closing.

[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:56.740]
How are you, sir?

[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:57.860]
Thank you so much.

[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.780]
Good, I'm glad to hear you back on the radio.

[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.560]
And listen, you and Neil should be sidekicks.

[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.900]
Oh, yeah, well, we've worked at Lawrence and ended in divorce.

[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.020]
Tick me on the side.

[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:07.740]
One of the other.

[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.180]
I already have a pain in the side.

[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:09.760]
I never worked.

[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.580]
I worked a little.

[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.100]
See you, Frank.

[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.060]
That's fine, you are.

[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:12.960]
Miami.

[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:14.380]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:15.780]
Good morning, Mr. Colman.

[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:16.400]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.180]
This is Gary.

[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.060]
Hi, Gary.

[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:22.720]
This is a power of day to the good debt strategy for West Platform up in North Carolina.

[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:23.720]
Oh, boy.

[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:24.220]
You're going to see?

[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.620]
That's one of the things that put me in the hospital.

[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.360]
Now, come on now.

[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.200]
Well, you sent me that fruit from up there.

[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.860]
Those good tomatoes and those peacats.

[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:33.660]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.540]
So, you've been here, you're, uh, when we're doing too well, if a lot.

[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.340]
That's right.

[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:39.420]
Are you getting that?

[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.120]
No.

[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:40.700]
No.

[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.840]
I was great until 10 o'clock in the morning.

[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.260]
Yeah, it's actually when you walked in here.

[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.240]
When you were in the middle of the night.

[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.600]
Especially when you walked in here.

[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:52.200]
Well, when they take your theme song and they plagiarize it and, uh, and then take your name

[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.120]
out of it.

[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:53.520]
I know.

[00:41:53.740 --> 00:42:01.580]
I insert some, uh, yeah, and then this one, uh, Johnny, uh, on the, uh, he just reads, uh,

[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.040]
how do I feel myself?

[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:03.840]
How do I feel?

[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:04.880]
Yeah, they're up here.

[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:05.480]
It's disgusting.

[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.220]
I mean, I don't know.

[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.360]
I don't know why they love me.

[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.100]
I'm so excited.

[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.220]
I feel myself.

[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:16.100]
I mean, that leads to people, you know, that there's no radio is changed.

[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:16.980]
Is this what?

[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:21.080]
There's thousands of people talking to me and talking about the, you know, the other guy

[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.000]
understands us.

[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:23.560]
Uh, it's disgusting.

[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:24.140]
It is.

[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:24.980]
It is.

[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.200]
I don't really know where.

[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.400]
I don't know where the radio's going, you see.

[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.160]
I, I tell you where it's going.

[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:33.080]
Right before.

[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.520]
What is on the maze?

[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.140]
And it's like, I just seem to be a William.

[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.220]
It's a pool.

[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:40.200]
I know.

[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:44.120]
Well, with any earth is made of, with no distress.

[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:50.380]
Why am I alive with no replacement?

[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.360]
Sorry about that.

[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.060]
We're gonna save in order of toast, okay?

[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.660]
All right, uh, one, one thing.

[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:55.220]
The opposite.

[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:55.540]
Yes.

[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:56.820]
Implosing.

[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:57.120]
Important.

[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:04.740]
closing. I watched C-SPAN this morning with WR. Was it big? I have a 13-inch screen and I

[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:09.720]
had to turn the TV off because it wouldn't fit inside the TV. Well just kind of slice it off on the edges.

[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:13.300]
I'm going to go back. Okay. Well that's going to do it and I saw you like that. The first

[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.980]
hour is over already. We've got one more hour than the ball coming on. I'll take you and drop

[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:21.440]
you off on your front yard. No, no. And you're rushing up to my house and get a pill and go to

[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:25.720]
mommy's for lunch and if he's listening it'll be around probably 130. Oh, it's going to carry me

[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:29.420]
over the threshold. Yeah. I'm sure everybody in the neighborhood can take them. Maybe your wife

[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.720]
can take some more of those good pictures of that. The ones that have the headshot. Hopefully.

[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:37.040]
That's it. Speaking of having your headshot up, Henry Barrow is standing by with our 11 o'clock

[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:18.780]
One in seven Americans suffers from a terrible affliction and while others find it funny

[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:25.500]
to those who have it, it's no laughing matter. It's called frequent burping syndrome.

[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:36.600]
It's terrible. I'll be on a date or a business meeting and and excuse me. See? See what happens?

[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:43.860]
Frequent burping syndrome. It can ruin your life but it doesn't have to. Now there's a clinic that

[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:50.300]
can help. Trained specialists. Sensitive to the needs of compulsive belchers. A special place

[00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:57.800]
known as burp-inders. Gosh, burp-inders saved my life. And a joy in and I were in love. I really wanted

[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:03.220]
to ask her to marry me but I just knew that when the moment of truth came I'd let out with a big

[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:14.040]
river. You know? Burp-inders. No shame. No guilt. No more tummy rumbling. Smelly belches. No more

[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:21.240]

you need. Don't wait. Here's the number to call. 5552877. That's 555. Burp-inders. Call today and stop being so gross.

[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:44.360]
You didn't see the race? No. This is Mr. Horosow here. They named it Tract-Gor-Anum. And you didn't

[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.120]
see the Med Malfa's. You didn't have the sports cameras. You got that crappy store cable.

[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.280]
And Pat stopped by, you know, Pat from Fat Tuesdays that I've been soliciting on here for

[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:58.900]
seconds. Oh. And his friend's feed. That is. He's been soliciting both of them for so many. Anyway. Oh.

[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:03.360]
No, but anyway, he was talking about the race. Now he's forgotten about it because easy goer ran a

[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.680]
crappy race. Right. Right. Oh, I loved it because I hate Pat Day with the like poison on his track

[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:13.640]
to a Belmont. That's his track. Housebuster had it all away and then what was the name of the horse

[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:19.100]
that won the Longshot criminal type? Yeah, the one that just won the Lucas entry. Just one that

[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:25.180]
part of the Lucas entry. Pimlico special. Who is it, Jackie? Who wrote him yesterday? Uh, Santos.

[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:31.300]
That's correct. See you didn't see the race. Well, and Horosow came in 1880. Yes, PN.

[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:38.060]
Yes, PN with Demi Ellis and to pay 1880 and just beat Housebuster by and that can you imagine

[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:45.080]
that he was a death wreck. Third 18 dollar easy goer was a desperate third like about a length

[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:50.880]
and a half to length. Who else was in the race? Anybody else? Oh, King of Dance. Remember that

[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:58.980]
like who was in there? He ran kind of a sickly race and uh, now there was much else in there.

[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:05.720]
Hey, listen, we only got a few minutes left. Let's move along. What do you think, man? Hello.

[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:14.760]
House given to Grandmother. Okay, hold on. Hollywood. You don't know who that is, do you? I know who it is.

[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:21.040]
You do? Try sure do it. Okay. Yes, but I will not give it away over the year. Okay. That's the

[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:27.720]
Hollywood said. What is it? Lisa. Lisa. Hi. How you doing, Lisa? I'm fine. I'm a first time

[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:34.620]
caller. Great. Um, my husband, Roger. He is still going to your station. Well, thank God for him. He's on

[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:40.640]
he's on a straight work. He's about a half hour and could you please get him about a half hour?

[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:46.040]
I'll do it to go to work. Yeah, go to work. Okay. We don't want to get personally, son. I first fall.

[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:51.640]
Could you play um, behind 95 songs? Well, you know, that's like a, you know, who built call to

[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:57.000]
get well, I heard him this morning. Yeah. And he's my guest here. And if I play that, it takes like

[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.120]
about three and a half minutes. I'm like, I got to sit through that. Essentially a lot. I'm going to go out

[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:05.280]
and have some toast. Yeah. He'll go out to King Paul's and have toast if you do that to him.

[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:10.900]
Okay. Then you don't have to. What's your husband's name? Roger. Roger. We will say a high Roger.

[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:15.680]
And the shoe fits where it. Okay. And speed it up a little Roger. Half hour is pretty slow.

[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:19.720]
I was wondering, Roger would tell me that you were in the hospital a little while ago.

[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.980]
Yeah, man. That you're diabetic. I'm also diabetic. Uh-huh. Are you on insulin or the

[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:28.340]
drug? No, I'm not. I'm on the pill. Oh, you're on the pill. Oh, yeah. Okay. I'll just carry you.

[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:34.760]
But every time I get up, it drops out. Okay. How about you? Are you on insulin? I'm on insulin. Wow.

[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:38.740]
It's too many of years. Hmm. You got everything under control? Yeah, everything is going on.

[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:42.240]
You can say she's on the pill. She's on the pill. And Roger doesn't know it.

[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:46.660]
I'll have a great day, Lisa. Your husband's okay in our book. Okay. Thank you. You too.

[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.680]
And good luck, my father. Thank you for the little more, my daughter. That'd be she don't know who you were.

[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:57.700]
Uh, was that Debbie? I had to. Mr. Crawler. This is George, Indiana. Oh, my God. How are you,

[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:03.080]
George? How are you? Is the more important question. Well, I'm doing just wonderful. He is so excited

[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:10.680]
to hear from you. You have no idea. He sounds wonderful. Oh, really? No. No, it's nice to talk to you.

[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:15.300]
I miss you. Well, thank you. Thank you. Uh, George,

[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:19.180]
I know for those of the people listening, don't know who she is. She's a waitress at the

[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:22.580]
Denny's over on the floor. I get that. That's how it's ready, George.

[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:32.080]
I was waiting table since I was 14 in my uncle's diner. Well, that's great. Well,

[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:36.160]
no, I'm just good to talk to you, but we're on Neil's show and you know how you get.

[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:40.740]
But Neil is allowing you to accept. Well, the key part was a big tipper. That's what I heard.

[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:47.680]
I wouldn't know. I'm just a new Billy. That's all. A Billy. Yes. Thank you. Well, that's great.

[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:51.580]
And I'm putting your Neil's feeling better. I sent you a get-well card. I hope you got it.

[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:56.400]
Well, thank you. Yes. He does feel a lot better and amazing. It belies his appearance. Yeah.

[00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:01.680]
I looked like him, but I feel like he looks great. He's lost a lot of weight. Let's find him.

[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:06.600]
But what a way to have to lose weight though. Oh, wait a minute. We just got a special flash here.

[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:13.260]
Debbie's TV show is not in delay on C span. So in other words, if she taking calls and it's not in

[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:19.040]
delay, okay, just makes it up. Oh, let's call her. Before you do that. Call her what? I must mention

[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:24.960]
something. Are you guys? How about Lardas? That would be good. Yes, you're good. I know. You're right.

[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:32.920]
Okay. What is yesterday? I was at a remote of one of your competitors. Station's been in the FPL.

[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:39.860]
Oh my god. Oh, I saw that. Ping-paw. No, Gilbert. Really? So I have a Gilbert's

[00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:46.320]
fiery body. He made a comment that I would say that. Great. But the funniest part I have to tell you

[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:51.780]
is that he had his transistor radio and he was listening to you while he was there. Yeah,

[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:55.000]
while Gilbert's loyal. Okay, he likes to spray the oil. Oh, I'll just say that's really

[00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.360]
loyal. Okay, George. Janice, it's been a long time. I know, but I've had to say hi to Bill.

[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:04.640]
Okay. Thank you. Say goodbye to Bill. Okay, Bill. Bye and I'll follow you wherever you go.

[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:09.940]
Okay. Saturdays, 10 to 2, WIOD. Oh, you're getting me intro. Don't let's see it, George.

[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:15.160]
Bye. No, it's in the same giving him a show. Now he can come on Saturday because I saw you

[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:18.500]
doesn't talk about me for four hours anyway because you got no show and no acting. He's got that

[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:22.000]
pathetic symphony. Hey, let me tell you something. Neil, come on and say, see you're right.

[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:25.520]
Neil always tries to get all his friends jobs and get everybody fired. You're right. See that. I'll take

[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:30.480]
on something. There's other things I like to talk about the Neil Rogers. I'm sick of hearing about

[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:36.500]
Neil. Me too. Me too. How about Bill Toul? How about Larry Beranoff? How about Ray Marsh?

[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:43.020]
How about you lambda Parapar? How about, uh, well, that's staff me. That one right there.

[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:49.060]
How about Phil Kostin? Hey, let's get those tapes out. That caused me to have that

[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:52.840]
stroke. Oh, I heard that. That was fun. That was some funny stuff. Anyway, we're going to do the

[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:57.480]
Fat Tuesday spot right now. Pat happens to be here just to coincidence and he was there at Fat Tuesdays.

[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:01.340]
Look what it's done for his life. Now he's here in the building. We have no idea why and he doesn't

[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:05.420]
either. And the gutter knows what will happen next. Anyway, Fat Tuesdays is a fun place.

[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:09.740]
After a tough day on the air like this, a good place to go and unwind, right? In fact, the timing

[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:14.480]
would be perfect if we left right now. It's 1113. They open at 1130. Oh, you know, we could make it

[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:19.240]
and Henry could drive us down there and get any of those incredible tropical drinks like

[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:23.760]
by the way, Pat said if any more imitators call it on Rick and Puts and pretend to be him, he's

[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:28.540]
going to sue their ass. And Nick just came in. You had a little meeting with first time you met him

[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:32.680]
in a long time. You had forgotten him, which is easy to do in this case. But you worked with him for

[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:38.620]
a week at W. Snow. That's right. That's it. When Fred of Astory, I left to go to W.I.N.Z.

[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:43.840]
Yeah. I was in limbo waiting to go to court, which everything's going to turn out okay.

[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:50.060]
And I was allowed to go to I.N.Z. Thanks to a wonderful judge. And anyway, you went,

[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:53.640]
you did, because I wasn't going back there, you took the job nights in W.S. News.

[00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:57.660]
Eighth from midnight. And I like what happened. You know what happened after that?

[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:04.280]
Well, I remember I was in your house with you in Mary Sue the night you called Alice Rantell

[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:08.600]
and said I'm not coming in. I can't cut it anymore. Your people are crazy and you, you know,

[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:11.900]
what the hell you want. And at first they wanted to just come in and be you. Don't try to be

[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:14.920]
new. Just do your thing. And then like the second day Luke Krohn was wondering,

[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:18.920]
oh, you got to get a little more time ago. You got to meet a little more, uh, come on. Let's

[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:24.160]
talk about the Jews and the humans. Come on, Bill. And they're what they want to use immediately.

[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:30.280]
Got the hell out of that thing. Remember that. You remember that when all the people were calling up

[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:34.400]
I bill, you know, or there wasn't at the time somebody called you up on the air and said,

[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:38.680]
I hope you dropped it or something like that. Well, the first night it was the first night you

[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:43.300]
wore. Oh, yeah. It was almost one of the most vicious calls I've ever gotten. It was probably

[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:49.240]
cursing many. What is that? Is that actually Bill? What is it? It's your pill. Wouldn't that be

[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:52.540]
something like there was a pill in a box this size? I bet even Debbie couldn't sit on that.

[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:58.020]
Miami. Hello, sir. Yes. Bill, I can hand hatching an egg, you know.

[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:03.640]
Bell and Neil, I've been waiting a long time to have a bill because I never heard him before.

[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:08.880]
Well, you never heard him before? No. And I've been singing that song, whiplinng it everywhere.

[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:15.560]
Everybody in this town when I get in the shower and you start singing that before they drop the

[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:21.140]
coast. Yeah, how you doing, sir? What is your name? Uh, Eligio. I'm sorry? Eligio. That's the

[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:26.440]
thing. Eligio. Eligio. Eligio. Eligio. Eligio. So, I don't like Alice. No, no, no. Eligio.

[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:31.940]
That's fun. What nationality are you? Eligio. I'm from Puerto Rico. Not Eligio. Eligio.

[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:37.380]
Newton. John. L.I. G.I.O. What did you say it again? L.I. G.I.O.

[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:40.700]
What do you mean? Eligio. Eligio. Eligio. Eligio. Eligio. Eligio.

[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.400]
Yes. All right. Let's get on with the Eligio one.

[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:46.760]
The end of the video, sawed Neil Rogers' program. Yes.

[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:51.900]
See for your. Now I can't get over how much it sounds like Sam Major.

[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:58.500]
What a job that was. Maybe we can put him in there.

[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:03.300]
You know what this is in his box? It's a Bart Simpson doll. Look at that. Isn't that cute?

[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:07.400]
With little flipper on. Oh, I hate Bart. It's a Bart Simpson doll.

[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:12.160]
Like the ones that you put on your car in a windshield with the little cups. In fact,

[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:15.660]
he's wearing a little cup under his skirt. You think that's unlike Sam Major's?

[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:20.680]
Yes, he does. God. Chucked a little bit. Now the other one.

[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:25.460]
Listen, have a wonderful life, Eligio. And I got a suggestion for you.

[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:27.660]
That is a compliment, I got a suggestion for you.

[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.040]
Right. Find a new name, pal.

[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:29.960]
Okay. I think.

[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:32.980]
Eleven, nineteen, and W.I. and deep-villacalters here.

[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:35.240]
All we got to do, have you ever eaten at the Armadillo Cafe?

[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:36.860]
No, but I've been dying to.

[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:41.100]
Well, before you die, please eat there. Because they'd be very upset if you didn't.

[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:43.360]
It is tremendous. Not far from my house either.

[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.780]
It's right up the road to pieces, right up the Davy Road extension.

[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:48.320]
On a corner of Davy Road and Griffin.

[00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:49.780]
That's the word of the job.

[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.180]
You know the other little strip shopping center there.

[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:53.980]
It looks like kind of a Yahoo place.

[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.000]
Like you can take your horse up there and tie it on a...

[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.700]
Wait a minute. It's 22 after 11.

[00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:59.340]
What is that? Oh, look at this.

[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:00.660]
This is what you've been waiting for.

[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:02.560]
This is like we've been building up to this.

[00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:24.340]
How many are menna?

[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.880]
Okay, cocking up and y'all think.

[00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:37.560]
Okay. Well, that's great.

[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:39.300]
Yeah, Bill will be translating that in noon.

[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:42.520]
Now, Cass is still been questioned because Melvin just told me the good news

[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:45.540]
that it's raining at Marklite Stadium where, of course, we know it never rains.

[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:49.560]
And the game is supposed to come out at noon today, which means we're supposed to leave it.

[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:52.460]
I'm also wondering what is that our food isn't here yet, which I'm not going to eat,

[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.720]
but Pat and Steve and I have to go.

[00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:56.140]
Oh, well, you have to go.

[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.280]
Well, you said I have to go at 12. Raise your hand.

[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:02.960]
But my question is, do we have contingency plans for what's going to happen?

[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:04.660]
Because I'm not going to like...

[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:05.460]
What does that mean?

[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:07.980]
Yeah, share old do the show.

[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:12.980]
By the way, did you hear us tell the story about when Bill worked at WS News for that week when I was in limbo

[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:14.140]
until that wonderful judge?

[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.780]
Let me go to WIs you did here.

[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:16.800]
That could. That was for your benefit.

[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:19.160]
No, I'm asking a serious question.

[00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:21.080]
They all stand there with a dumb smile on their face.

[00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.080]
What? What is the answer?

[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:25.500]
You. You what?

[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:28.760]
You want to suppose that you're riding a 1230?

[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:30.860]
You sound like somebody from David.

[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:31.520]
You what?

[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:32.460]
Coral Gables.

[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:33.760]
Neil.

[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:34.640]
You say what?

[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.600]
Hey, did you have an overstatement?

[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.320]
Look what it's been for her.

[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:37.780]
You what?

[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:38.520]
You say what?

[00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:40.560]
I got a Debbie Eleanor's.

[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:40.940]
I got a Debbie Eleanor's.

[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:41.400]
I got a Debbie Eleanor's.

[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:41.500]
You what?

[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.680]
Debbie Eleanor's fire report.

[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:44.200]
Okay.

[00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:45.620]
She's live on television.

[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:46.620]
We know that.

[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:48.520]
So we've been talking about it all morning long.

[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:50.000]
Well, I'm a wintered one.

[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:51.800]
What do you got like a 50 inch Sony?

[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:52.820]
For me?

[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:53.320]
Yeah.

[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:55.960]
Well, how the hell can you see our old body?

[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.980]
If you don't have a big screen.

[00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:58.200]
What's Nick Novaro?

[00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.240]
He's the center of attention.

[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:00.280]
I'm feeling.

[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:01.020]
I'm on the North Carolina.

[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:01.720]
You see on the show?

[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:02.200]
Yeah.

[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.440]
I should have.

[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:05.680]
They highlighted her big zits yet or what?

[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:06.540]
Nothing.

[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:07.280]
They could make her born.

[00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:07.860]
Okay.

[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:10.660]
My father said she'd get enormous zits.

[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:12.180]
At least I thought that was the word he said.

[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.060]
It could have been something else.

[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.680]
They have to go either way.

[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:15.020]
Yeah.

[00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:17.200]
Did you ever get a good one to watch in the Simpsons?

[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:20.600]
No, sir, but I do have my little Simpson doll here right now.

[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:21.020]
I heard.

[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:21.280]
I know.

[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:22.780]
With the little pantaloonies on him.

[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:23.240]
It's home.

[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:24.020]
He makes the show.

[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:24.680]
Okay.

[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:25.560]
Oh, so.

[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:27.220]
Is it with this homo?

[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:27.520]
Homo?

[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:28.520]
Yeah.

[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:29.760]
This is the Dwayne's Domconic.

[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:30.460]
Oh, yeah.

[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.660]
I'm not going to request Dwayne's Domconic.

[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:34.560]
Good because we don't have time for any requests because the show may end at noon

[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.680]
or not as a case may be.

[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.140]
We may have to fill a hole for it.

[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:39.700]
Wouldn't that be something after we cancel the concert if we were here, too?

[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:40.380]
That would be great.

[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:41.340]
Can you imagine that?

[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:42.820]
But we may be standing by.

[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:44.020]
What do we have?

[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:44.500]
Oh, no.

[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:45.840]
Hey, I'm on the floor.

[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.200]
The over-daffy out.

[00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:48.260]
Greg needs your help, Phil.

[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:49.460]
The employment search.

[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:50.260]
What do you want?

[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:51.200]
The employment search.

[00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:52.740]
Do you know that Bill Calder is sitting here,

[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.140]
sure, while you're rambling on and going?

[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:54.700]
No, let him go.

[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:55.240]
Let him go.

[00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:55.840]
No way.

[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:57.640]
Okay, we have the line open and brown.

[00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:58.880]
524 Calder.

[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:00.160]
524 W.O.D.

[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.040]
We don't have time for these, and there's no mix.

[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:02.800]
Jupiter.

[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.220]
Oh, hi, Bill.

[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:04.860]
Hi.

[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:07.900]
You know, the last time I talked to you,

[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:09.420]
you were down in New Orleans.

[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:10.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:12.120]
They got out of there.

[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:15.260]
And I moved down here about a month ago.

[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:16.020]
I mean, where?

[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:18.260]
I used to listen to you all the time.

[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:18.920]
I'd meet night.

[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:19.980]
Well, I'll be done.

[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.120]
I don't know if you remember me.

[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:22.960]
No, I don't.

[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:23.880]
Oh, okay.

[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:27.200]
Well, I was listening to you all the time.

[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:29.520]
Well, you're the charming voice.

[00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:30.560]
Oh, thank you.

[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:31.520]
Thank you.

[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:33.220]
Thank you for being charming.

[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:34.720]
Thank you for getting out in New Orleans.

[00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:38.520]
Oh, well, you know, those little things

[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:39.600]
that you eating in New Orleans,

[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.520]
those little crawfish,

[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.200]
they're called crawfish, yeah.

[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:44.400]
You know how we call them there?

[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:45.820]
We call them mud bugs.

[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:46.500]
Mud bugs.

[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:47.060]
That's right.

[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:49.520]
You bite the, you suck the heads.

[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:50.840]
Yeah, it's all time.

[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.820]
And anyway, I, you know what?

[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:55.200]
I can't talk.

[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.620]
One of my famous restaurant critics

[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:57.600]
used to do that often,

[00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.080]
but we don't get them that.

[00:59:59.340 --> 00:59:59.780]
Well, I do.

[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:00.320]
You know, wait a minute.

[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:00.720]
Hold it.

[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.600]
What is your name, man?

[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:03.020]
My name?

[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.000]
My name?

[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:04.760]
My name?

[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:06.420]
Why did Pat get all red in the face

[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:07.440]
when you asked that question?

[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.240]
What is that all about?

[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:08.980]
I think there's something.

[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.040]
What is your name, man?

[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.200]
Maria?

[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:12.140]
Maria.

[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.060]
Oh, you know who this is?

[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.140]
No, it's Maria.

[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:16.460]
A whole lot of men are Maria.

[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.660]
I want to tell them about mud bugs, a crawfish.

[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:19.640]
Oh.

[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.340]
The people that really get into those fish,

[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.880]
they actually suck the heads

[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.920]
and it's delicious.

[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:29.860]
Yeah, sometimes it is.

[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:30.720]
Sometimes.

[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.980]
Okay, I know.

[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.220]
But anyway, you know,

[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.500]
I met my husband, Tuneer,

[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:37.580]
about seven years ago.

[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.140]
Seven years ago.

[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:40.340]
On a day,

[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:42.500]
I met him Tuneer in the...

[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.500]
I remember this call.

[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:46.360]
Incredible.

[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:49.040]
Well, listen, Maria, in closing.

[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.820]
You know, my husband is Greek.

[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:52.920]
A Greek?

[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:53.700]
Oh, my God.

[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.000]
You're the people that live in the house

[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.320]
sput and fort Lauderdale.

[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.100]
No, we live in Jupiter, Florida.

[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:00.700]
Yeah, but you used to wait a minute.

[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:01.120]
Didn't you?

[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:02.380]
Did you used to love your rings?

[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:03.460]
I used to live in Florida,

[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:04.780]
we used to live there in the house.

[01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:05.260]
That's right.

[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.260]
And he used to cook Greek food.

[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:07.980]
Uh-huh.

[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:11.080]
Or you cook Greek food.

[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:11.480]
That's him.

[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:12.340]
I met him to meal.

[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:13.360]
Am I right or wrong?

[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:14.500]
I'm married to John Lennon.

[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:15.040]
You're right.

[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.400]
I used to get a geek.

[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.140]
Hey, listen, let me tell you.

[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:18.940]
I remember it.

[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:19.800]
I didn't find him.

[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.920]
Well, listen, what a call this is.

[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.320]
You can get him, I'll tell you.

[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.320]
You still have that amount.

[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:25.560]
We got him off there.

[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:26.700]
And you manipulate them.

[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:27.620]
No.

[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:29.220]
Listen, Maria.

[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.500]
There's that music.

[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.080]
Oh, okay, Bill.

[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:33.100]
Nice to meet you.

[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.360]
Okay, hey, good day, Maria.

[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:35.560]
Say hello to your husband.

[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:35.900]
Good.

[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:36.800]
Okay, I will.

[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:37.560]
Bye-bye, Neil.

[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.600]
Bye-bye.

[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.620]
28 past 11 in WIOD.

[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.660]
We're kind of like in limbo.

[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:44.620]
This is a comedy plot is what they love it or leave it.

[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:44.880]
Yeah.

[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.440]
And I'm ready to leave it right now.

[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.020]
We have an opening in Broward, by the way.

[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.240]
524 WQAM.

[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:51.840]
WIOD.

[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:52.560]
Hi, Neil.

[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:53.000]
Bill.

[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.080]
Who is this?

[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.140]
How is the G-man?

[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:55.840]
How are you?

[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:56.800]
Uh-huh.

[01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.480]
Who is your lady?

[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.060]
That was Maria.

[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:00.940]
Maria.

[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:01.440]
Yeah.

[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.460]
How old is she?

[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.900]
I think she just brought your demos away.

[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:04.860]
She's adorable.

[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:05.860]
She's a, uh,

[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:08.940]
Latin American who's married to a geek from Uranus.

[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:10.200]
A big geek, it sound like.

[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:10.460]
Yeah.

[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:12.940]
And she cooks Greek food on Jupiter.

[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.180]
What is Greek food?

[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.320]
Like greasy stuff?

[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:16.000]
Yeah.

[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:16.720]
Yeah, greasy stuff.

[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.300]
Yeah, sure.

[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.420]
It's like little uh,

[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.160]
crawfish that you suck the head on.

[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:20.600]
That's right.

[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.060]
Do you agree to crawfish, sir?

[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:23.920]
Let's move forward.

[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:24.520]
Not backward.

[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:25.520]
What is the crawfish?

[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.080]
Okay, crawfish.

[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.300]
The meaning of the crawl is I want you

[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:31.200]
and Bill to sing a song for me right now.

[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:31.660]
Yeah.

[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:32.540]
Good luck to you.

[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:33.620]
Come on, Neil.

[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.620]
Now we aren't going to sing for you,

[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:37.720]
but we have a guy who used to work here as a matter of fact,

[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:38.800]
who does a hell of a job.

[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.220]
Wait a minute.

[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:39.660]
Who Alex?

[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:41.500]
Well, you shouldn't have said that

[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:42.380]
because we can't mention his name.

[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:42.880]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:45.720]
Well, it might change your whole outlook on life, okay?

[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:46.200]
Please.

[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:47.220]
Here we go.

[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:49.760]
Mr. Bird.

[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.360]
We don't do this for Christmas.

[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:52.000]
It's the fire.

[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:52.400]
Wait a minute.

[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:56.320]
Nobody is there somebody else.

[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.480]
Somebody is nobody.

[01:02:59.040 --> 01:02:59.660]
We're nobody.

[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.780]
It's your thing along.

[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.180]
Nobody loves me.

[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.860]
Ex-self, Neil Roger.

[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.540]
And he really does.

[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:09.540]
Thank you.

[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.300]
The world is hard, Joe.

[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.140]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:13.440]
That's what happened here.

[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.180]
Yeah, thanks.

[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:15.740]
Yeah, we're getting back to that part.

[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:16.900]
We're really in a small city.

[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:17.320]
Okay.

[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:18.940]
Yes.

[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:20.720]
The world is over.

[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:21.500]

[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:22.860]
The world is over.

[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:23.540]
Here we go.

[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:24.180]
Okay.

[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:25.960]
Next to the...

[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.100]
Buzz.

[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:27.380]
Buzz.

[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:28.480]
Buzz.

[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:29.120]
Buzz.

[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:31.140]
Somebody.

[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:31.140]

[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:34.740]
Buzz.

[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.200]
Buzz.

[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.480]
Buzz.

[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.160]
Buzz.

[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:39.580]
Buzz.

[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:40.060]

[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:40.060]

[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:40.860]
Buzz.

[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:42.880]
Buzz.

[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:43.820]
Buzz.

[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:45.580]
Buzz.

[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:47.300]

[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:47.300]

[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:47.540]

[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:47.540]

[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:47.540]

[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:47.720]

[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:48.120]
Buzz.

[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:48.400]

[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:49.660]
Buzz.

[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:49.680]

[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:52.380]
All right.

[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:53.320]
That was good for you.

[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.600]
Speaking of that, you know, I play that.

[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:57.000]
You know why?

[01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:59.980]
Because it's the old story that I never had a chance to tell.

[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:06.140]
Well, you worked with this man, we can't mention Alex Bennett in Houston, like in the 1800s.

[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:07.260]
Long time ago.

[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.880]
When he came here, the first time Phil in for me said he was 49.

[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:14.060]
Then when he came to work here, he was 44. By the time he left, he was 18.

[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:19.520]
And by now, he should be like pre-embrotic at this point.

[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.980]
Now that was what year in 1963?

[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:27.900]
Well, my first year in radio, so the 63 years said.

[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.920]
Yeah, well, that's why he's 27 years ago.

[01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:35.400]
So if he's 44, that means he was 17 years old when you work with him in Houston.

[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:44.160]
No, he's a lot older than that because he knew words that I didn't know, that nobody that was live in Teen or 18.

[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.600]
Like that, he's good, he is great.

[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.200]
Isn't that true, man?

[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.540]
I'm feeling...

[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:00.000]
Okay, hold on, this has been it.

[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:04.580]
We have an opening at Broward 524 Alex 524 WYOD.

[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.940]
Okay, good kiss there from a pet, that was the imposter.

[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:10.600]
Or maybe with Swarpat.

[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:14.420]
The 655 WYOD in Palm Beach, Phil Cauver's with us, we're going to be a new one.

[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:19.960]
The ballgame is allegedly starting, but I have a feeling we've gotten sucked in to a real deal here today.

[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.660]
See, when I tell you, hey, two hour show, no sweat, you leave it no one, everything's going to be great.

[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:28.500]
Then all of a sudden, hey, it's raining in the ballpark and you're like to stand by.

[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:33.760]
Somehow, I don't sometimes I feel like we're getting sucked in, but I could be wrong.

[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:37.260]
I'll pay phone in OJIS.

[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:38.020]
Hello.

[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:38.560]
Yes.

[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:39.640]
Good morning, gentlemen.

[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:40.320]
Yes, sir.

[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:43.840]
Neil, Neil, I haven't talked to you in, it's been like three years.

[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:44.800]
Thank God.

[01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:48.700]
Yeah, I know, well, I haven't had any material, I've already had a good material in the three years.

[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:54.420]
But I think this is something that I needed to say, I don't really want to interrupt your show, but this one I think.

[01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:56.100]
In other words, this is not a call from Bill Cauver.

[01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:01.700]
Well, it's, sir, tell him the truth, you never heard of me, you don't care about me exactly.

[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.360]
To tell you the truth, I've heard about you from Neil, but I never heard of you.

[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:05.780]
Exactly.

[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:06.820]
That's right.

[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:07.960]
I knew it wouldn't, I wouldn't lie.

[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:09.220]
Hey, what is your first name?

[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.240]
But I should, my first name is Paul.

[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:12.060]
What is it?

[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:12.620]
Paul.

[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.400]
I never heard of you before.

[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.140]
How about some toes?

[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.360]
Can you ever heard of your OJIS?

[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:18.580]
Lightly buttered?

[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:19.980]
Can you ever heard of your OJIS?

[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:22.240]
No, you sound like a good caller to me, Paul.

[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:25.420]
I used to be, it's just that I haven't called in such a long time.

[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:33.360]
Well, I've been off the air for a couple of months, and I haven't taken any calls, and to me, you sound good.

[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:38.420]
Well, yeah, well, it could be, but I don't know if this is going to be good or not.

[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.500]
No, it might be.

[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.160]
There's a shot building up here somewhere, Paul.

[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.380]
I get the general's riff.

[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.320]
Now, let's get right to it.

[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.400]
Let's not beat around the voice.

[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.520]
It's actually about something that happened in the Middle East.

[01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:47.800]
Last week it was a...

[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:51.500]
Something that happened in the Middle East, and you're calling this show...

[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.440]
Well, it's...

[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.160]
What was it?

[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.220]
A brisk, and Arab got a brisk in the Middle East.

[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:56.000]
What is it, sir?

[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.400]
The two countries of North Yemen and South Yemen...

[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:00.820]
North Yemen and South Yemen.

[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:01.700]
North Yemen and South Yemen.

[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:02.280]
Right.

[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.480]
They joined together to...

[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.200]
Yeah, sir, let me make a suggestion to Paul.

[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:06.560]
Can I make a suggestion to you?

[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:07.760]
I'll probably...

[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:08.560]
Happy Shavuas.

[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.960]
1133, and you know something?

[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:12.520]
It is Shavuas.

[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:13.500]
Right?

[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:15.120]
Oh, yeah.

[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:19.240]
I think somebody will call in and provide today's Shavuas, which is why Bill Carter's here.

[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:20.880]
He only comes on on the Jewish holidays.

[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:22.040]
W-Y-O-D.

[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:23.800]
Yeah, could I say how to bill?

[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:24.580]
Sure, hold on.

[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:25.560]
W-Y-O-D.

[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.340]
Okay, that was following again.

[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.540]
He just went for 27 minutes.

[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:28.960]
You watch.

[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:32.040]
After knowing he will not think on no more cranks on me of Palm Beach Line.

[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.660]
Time for times and labor.

[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:34.260]
Hail.

[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:34.860]
Yes, sir.

[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.900]
Yeah, somebody mentioned that you might be...

[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:38.600]
Or served time or did something in Rochester.

[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:39.840]
Serve time?

[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:41.720]
I'm serving time here, sir.

[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:43.260]
Hey, Mrs. Fitz, were you in Rochester?

[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.080]
Yeah, I'm born there.

[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:45.920]
You were born in Rochester?

[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:46.100]
You were born in Rochester?

[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:46.100]

[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:48.480]
I didn't know what this was.

[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:49.140]
Yeah, I was a Jew.

[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:53.500]
I know I know it's not too far from Annaculair, but what war were you around?

[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:54.680]
What war was I in?

[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:54.960]
War.

[01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:56.140]
War.

[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.340]
By 19th, or 10th, or...

[01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.160]
What the hell was I in there?

[01:07:59.160 --> 01:07:59.760]
I was a kid.

[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.520]
How the hell do I know what war I was in?

[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:05.000]
Well, can't you discuss things in more or less political terms?

[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.120]
Well, were you there during the 1951 NBA Championship?

[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:10.060]
Yeah, I was nine years old.

[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:10.660]
Okay.

[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.780]
Sir, how old are you?

[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.880]
You don't sound very old?

[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:14.620]
35?

[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.060]
Yes, so what do you know about you?

[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.100]
What are you even born yet?

[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:19.080]
Well, my day keeps feeding me left here.

[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:22.580]
That year in Jan, oh, less Harris and my uncle was the first coach of the Rochester

[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:26.920]
Roswelln and were the Rochester Siegrams, and less Harris and played for him in 1944.

[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:28.240]
How do you like that, sir?

[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:29.680]
And probably Bobby Wonser.

[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:34.940]
Bobby Wonser and Bob Davies, Bob Davies and Arnie E. Arisen?

[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:35.560]
Yeah.

[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:36.820]
And all those go in.

[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.760]
And Barer, Arnie E. Arisen was a Jewel, excuse me, right?

[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:42.580]
Commonly shorter with the Montreal Royals.

[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:44.820]
Barer with a Buffalo Bison's.

[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.340]
And Havana Sugar Kings, who was that pitcher that pitched for the Havana Sugar?

[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:49.860]
Was it Pedro Ramos?

[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:51.260]
Pedro Ramos.

[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:54.660]
And Camilo Pascual and a partridge and a pair of three.

[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:55.400]
How do you like that?

[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:57.880]
What war did you live in?

[01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:01.300]
Can't you just talk in a less clinical manner like we're part of the city?

[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:02.740]
What are the city to grow up in?

[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:03.200]
I don't know.

[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:06.260]
Okay, Terrace, there was off Holland Beck Avenue.

[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:09.540]
Holland Beck Street, or by Avenue D, Avenue D.

[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.800]
Over by Conkey Avenue, you know, that was number eight school.

[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:16.180]
And Brighton, right, by the 12 corners, by Don and Bob.

[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:20.540]
Do you know anything about Rochester, sir, or do you go by everything your father tells you?

[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.320]
Because I think your father is a real honor.

[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:23.400]
I grew up in Rochester.

[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.020]
You did?

[01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.520]
No wonder you're all so good.

[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:26.760]
I think it's Don and Bob's anymore.

[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:27.420]
This cold little room.

[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:27.580]
Sure.

[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:28.780]
I hate to break in those.

[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:32.460]
But if Don and Bob's is right next door to Brighton Elementary, okay?

[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:35.980]
There's a little refill there, and I was there last summer, and it is Don and Bob.

[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:36.680]
You're wrong.

[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:40.260]
It's the original Don and they changed the name because they changed the ownership last year.

[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:41.720]
They changed the name when?

[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:43.640]
It must have been very recently because I was there with them.

[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.840]
I've been an article in Homer's, let me send it to you.

[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.260]
When did they change the name?

[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:48.840]
It's called the original Don.

[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.620]
When did they change the name?

[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.160]
Within the last year.

[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.640]
The less than that.

[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:56.120]
Very recently, it's right there on Monroe Avenue, sir.

[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.060]
What difference does it make?

[01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.200]
What the name is?

[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:02.560]
They still have the porkers and the ground rounds.

[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:03.780]
It's still the same.

[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.300]
What is the guy that bought it?

[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:05.860]
Is ruining it.

[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:06.920]
The guy from Wendy's.

[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:07.160]
Yeah.

[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:07.800]
Right?

[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:11.440]
What a workout.

[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:13.280]
Well listen, have a nice day.

[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:14.940]
We'll see it on St. Paul Street, okay?

[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:16.760]
On St. Paul Street.

[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.660]
An Eastman Kodak.

[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:18.440]
Oh, well.

[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:19.240]
St. Paul Street.

[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:20.180]
St. Paul Street.

[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:20.180]

[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:20.180]

[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:20.180]

[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:20.860]
St. Paul Street.

[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:21.620]
St. Paul Street.

[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:25.160]
St. Paul Street.

[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:26.200]
An Eastman Kodak.

[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:26.840]

[01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:28.180]

[01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:29.060]
You served time there.

[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:31.800]
Yeah, I was in Monroe Prison or something.

[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.460]
What the hell is this man talking about?

[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:34.900]
maniac.

[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.200]
Well, don't take it out on me.

[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:38.840]
I'm a guest.

[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:40.120]
Normally one of your people.

[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:44.040]
Anyway, Margate is where they're really doing it at Charhaut now.

[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:46.520]
And in Coral Springs and Coconut Creek in North Lauderdale,

[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:47.940]
and all seven South Florida trots.

[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:51.560]
But the newest Charhaut is in Margate, which is a prestige joint, right?

[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.060]
Margate, that's the place to be exactly.

[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.700]
And if you're kind of hobbling around Margate looking for a great place for lunch today,

[01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:01.080]
they're open every morning, early at Charhaut, for your early lunch people at 10.30.

[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:04.740]
And now they've got the Neodeal, a special everyday this week.

[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.960]
And for the next couple of weeks, two big buffalo sea Rochester.

[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:10.240]
We work in upstate New York.

[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.700]
Two buffalo-style jumbo hot dogs.

[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:14.760]
Charb world exactly the way I come on the grill.

[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.040]
And a large soft drink.

[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.440]
Only $2.99.

[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:22.620]
That's the Neodeal at Charhaut right now, including at the newest location in Margate on

[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:24.440]
441 South Atlantic Boulevard.

[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:27.980]
Margate, it's fast, it's delicious, it's fresh, they use the best ingredients.

[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:30.080]
They grind the chuck every day.

[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.740]
They grind their pork butts every day.

[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:33.840]
And not everybody will do that.

[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:37.620]
And they take the bone and skin off their chicken every day, which is quite a delicate

[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:38.220]
other ingredient.

[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:43.580]
So you head for a fast, inexpensive, delicious, succulent lunch at Charhaut or dinner or snack

[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:44.420]
as the case may be.

[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:50.260]
In some rise, Tamarack Davey, Hollywood, Miami Oakland Park, and the newest Charhaut at 306 North

[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:51.880]
State Road 7 in Margate.

[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:55.980]
So, Davey, get the fire on the food.

[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.300]
Boy, now don't start getting personal with my guest, Scalter.

[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:03.680]
The food is here from American, steak, and pizza, and these guys are picking out Steve and the

[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:03.940]
Pat.

[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:05.820]
This is the real Pat, not the imposter.

[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:08.320]
And the bill is going to dig in with something.

[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:08.980]
Oh, that's weird.

[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.740]
Now, what's the word from the ballpark?

[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.160]
This is turning into a real what?

[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:13.000]
The game is on.

[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:13.740]
Everything's great.

[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:14.660]
Good.

[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:15.800]
Because I'm leaving it alone.

[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:18.880]
I have to deposit Mr. Calder back in his place.

[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:19.940]
WIOD.

[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:22.920]
What are you looking at?

[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:23.840]
A basket, sir?

[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:24.800]
What is your story?

[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.420]
What kind of a phone are you on?

[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:30.780]
That's better.

[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:31.800]
I was on a speaker phone.

[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:32.940]
Well, get off it, pal.

[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:33.620]
I don't know.

[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.600]
I'd like to sing.

[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:35.740]
You like to sing?

[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:36.440]
What do you want to sing?

[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.200]
Oh, nobody.

[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.040]
Till somebody does that.

[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:40.760]
Okay, hold on.

[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:41.300]
We'll get to you.

[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:42.080]
WIOD.

[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:43.940]
Hey, with that guy knows about Rochester.

[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:45.280]
You could put in a symbol.

[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.700]
And have room for a potion alarm left over.

[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.500]
Steve Rees and Bouchin Lombs.

[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:49.740]
Yeah.

[01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.120]
An empire born from the world.

[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.240]
What Lord did you live in?

[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:53.340]
Do you know Bill Calder, sir?

[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:54.240]
Yeah, he's great.

[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:54.840]
Right.

[01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:55.500]
He's right here.

[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:56.560]
Yeah, a greatest pal.

[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:58.340]
Is that it?

[01:12:58.620 --> 01:12:59.500]
No change in his hand.

[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:00.200]
No changes pal.

[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:02.140]
What the hell is going on here?

[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:02.660]
Man, look at this.

[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.280]
They got enough food for the Chinese army.

[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.340]
You guys are crazy.

[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.240]
Look at that.

[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:07.220]
Hi.

[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:08.020]

[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:09.200]
Look at that.

[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.100]
Salas and I can't eat anything.

[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.640]
But thanks to the memories.

[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:13.780]
No, I can't eat it dear.

[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:14.460]
Like I told you.

[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.500]
I have to take a pill.

[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.920]
It's a big process when I eat.

[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:17.480]
This is good.

[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.260]
I want to worry about running downstairs now.

[01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:19.620]
Exactly.

[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.200]
We brought a little container for you there.

[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.040]
Yeah.

[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.340]
Just don't dribble on the carpet in place.

[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:25.220]
W-Y-O-D.

[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:26.180]
Exactly.

[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:27.720]
W-Y-O-D.

[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:28.920]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:29.520]
Okay.

[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:31.040]
What's going on?

[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.680]
We got the serious figureplor on the term spike.

[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:35.020]
Okay.

[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:35.840]
Lay it on a spell.

[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:37.040]
We got very short on time.

[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:37.860]
A lot of pressure here.

[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:38.360]
A lot of pressure.

[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:38.700]
Go ahead.

[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:39.260]
Okay.

[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:45.460]
We got, just as you come over, Okchov, there's three of them right in the row waiting for you.

[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:46.100]
Three pigs?

[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:46.940]
They're out there.

[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:48.940]
And what the hell is the deal with I-75 now?

[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:52.900]
If anybody knows about that, you know they've got the 45 mile speed signs up there.

[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:53.280]
I know.

[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.080]
So there's no construction.

[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:55.960]
There's nothing going on.

[01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:57.660]
They just want the pace to be able to put you over.

[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.220]
Everybody's going 65-70.

[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.260]
I come down there this morning.

[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:04.100]
45 speed limit on the row that's out in the, in the boondocks.

[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:04.900]
I know.

[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.600]
It's a joke because they line up there too.

[01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:09.840]
And don't point over if you go 46-47.

[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:10.320]
Yeah.

[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.260]
For going too slow.

[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.940]
Hey, did you hear Gover down the Rineri show this morning?

[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:14.380]
Yes, sir.

[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:14.920]
I sure did.

[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:15.580]
Oh, God.

[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:16.420]
He's just everywhere.

[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.800]
Look at the food that's coming there.

[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:20.240]
These people out of their minds.

[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:21.640]
Cheese.

[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:22.260]
New place.

[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:24.600]
It's American steak and pizza, sir.

[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:25.080]
It's great.

[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:25.760]
They got pizza.

[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:27.400]
They got fillies, steak sandwiches.

[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:28.220]
We got salads.

[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:29.680]
We got tons of stuff.

[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.940]
And I got to see how much everybody shoveled down their throat.

[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:32.420]
Oh, God.

[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:33.520]
That's a killer.

[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.180]
Thanks for the reports, sir.

[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:35.840]
Mr. Calder.

[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:36.580]
Yes, sir.

[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.240]
Good luck, T.A.

[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:39.660]
And I hope you feel better.

[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:40.480]
Thank you.

[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.720]
And now, Tony can burglety.

[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:43.800]
Okay, Tony.

[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:44.440]
Hi, everybody.

[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:45.380]
Now, wait a minute.

[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:49.480]
This fat pig, Johnny Dark just come in here, now that we haven't seen him hide in the

[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.260]
area from the coast all morning long.

[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:52.760]
The food comes in here and this.

[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.520]
Look at how ready he is in the face.

[01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:58.560]
This man would no shame this disgusting, cowardly, radio-drifter pizza.

[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.320]
He never comes over to say hi to him.

[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.240]
Over here from the coast.

[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:03.720]
And all he could sniff it through the damn doorway over here.

[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.340]
I can never see anything like it in my life.

[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:06.520]
You are a disgrace.

[01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:07.340]
Have some food, Joe.

[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:08.640]
Um.

[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.480]
Or are you still waiting to sing?

[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:11.340]
How are you doing?

[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:11.820]
Sir.

[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:12.500]
Hello.

[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:13.360]
Are you still waiting?

[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:13.700]
Yes.

[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:14.200]
Okay, okay.

[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:15.240]
Um.

[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:16.300]
How about you, man?

[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:16.720]
Are you okay?

[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.740]
How's the world be all those readers disappeared?

[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:21.960]
I'll tell you.

[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.360]
Okay, here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:26.100]
Yeah, on the Palm Beach line.

[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:26.640]
Okay.

[01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:27.220]
On the way.

[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:27.660]
Get in.

[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:28.380]
Big spender.

[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:31.340]
I'm the first, uh, yeah, calling my distance on a mobile.

[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:32.640]
What?

[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:33.880]
Great.

[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:38.100]
I've called you a couple times that you've always hung up on me and I don't know.

[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:38.640]
Well, no.

[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:39.120]
Okay.

[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.180]
Let's see if we can do it again.

[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:41.700]
Let's work on it.

[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.460]
Uh, what I like.

[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:42.820]
What do we do?

[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:43.880]
Here's a listen.

[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:45.840]
I have to take this man home.

[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:49.120]
I have to go to Mommies and Mr. Disney already thinks that I'm going to the ballgame.

[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:49.660]
They're sorry.

[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:50.540]
I can't go.

[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.280]
I can't go.

[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:51.600]
Okay.

[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.620]
I can't go.

[01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:53.660]
I've got 85 people.

[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.580]
I've got 4,000 pounds of food here.

[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:56.980]
People are crazy.

[01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.760]
I just had a stinkin' stroke, sir.

[01:15:59.200 --> 01:15:59.760]
If I have the line.

[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:01.940]
I should sound sick, then they'd have a little more sympathy.

[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.160]
See, everybody would go, you hope you feel it better.

[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:05.740]
I just had a goddamn stroke.

[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:06.560]
If I have a line.

[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:07.320]
Yes, sir.

[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:08.420]
If I have a line with you now.

[01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:10.500]
I just want to ask you a question.

[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:11.140]
You're a great painter.

[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:11.880]
I don't want to be excited.

[01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:12.620]
I'm a great one.

[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:13.740]
You're a great entertainer.

[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:14.220]
A great painter.

[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.500]
And you definitely have to work on it.

[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:17.520]
This is going to be a shot.

[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:18.780]
We're having such a good time here.

[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:22.000]
You want to, you want to, you want to, like, sell the negative depressing crap.

[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:26.020]
I just wonder whether when you talk to your personal friends, and I know you have hundreds,

[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:28.460]
do you talk to them the same way you talk to your listener?

[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:29.280]
They're damn right.

[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:30.500]
That's why I stay alone all the time.

[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.160]
Otherwise, when you're on the phone at home, you got to go home.

[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:33.720]
This is just a radio show.

[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:34.380]
Okay, sir.

[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:35.580]
I can't understand it.

[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.420]
Now I know why you usually hang up on you.

[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:38.880]
Because you just don't like sitting there.

[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:39.340]
Oh, radio show.

[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:43.080]
When you're at home, do you have like a microphone in front of your coffee table?

[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:45.780]
Yes, I have a big thing right on my coffee table.

[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.320]
Because you can't say that on the radio?

[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:48.020]
A big thing.

[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:48.920]
Yes, I'm right.

[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:51.220]
Well, I just want to whether you're like at home.

[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:51.580]
No.

[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:52.860]
Ask Bill Carter.

[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:53.960]
He'll tell you that off the air.

[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.460]
I'm a wonderful, warm, sensitive piece of crap.

[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:57.000]
All right.

[01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:59.060]
You can't trace this clock because I'm on a mobile right?

[01:16:59.060 --> 01:16:59.880]
That's what you think.

[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:00.340]
Uh-oh.

[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:01.440]
See, have a nice day.

[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:04.780]
We were really doing it there for a while.

[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.340]
How is the food coming here?

[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:07.400]
Have you had anything yet?

[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.500]
Or have you taken it with you?

[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:10.220]
Bill, no.

[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:11.840]
I'm not just sitting with you.

[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:12.340]
I've asked you.

[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:12.840]
Amazing.

[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:13.600]
I know.

[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:17.120]
Well, the guy from Rochester and this guy out of Github, I hope they run into each other in a highway

[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:18.160]
and the pigs nail their ass.

[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:18.760]
Hollywood.

[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:19.720]
Hey, Neil.

[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:20.260]
How you doing?

[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:20.680]
Good.

[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:22.980]
Pay a question for you.

[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:27.800]
Sometimes a friend of mine has two original 1956 World Series.

[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:29.460]
Does this have to do with our guests, sir?

[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:30.020]
Yes, does.

[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:31.580]
I'm an old titan.

[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:32.260]
Oh, okay.

[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:34.660]
1956 Yankees versus the Dodge.

[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:36.180]
John Larson and Don Nukum.

[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:38.080]
But the bill is sound magly.

[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.900]
Two baseballs with the name names of all the team members.

[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:41.820]
Johnny Padbury.

[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:42.660]
Say what did they make?

[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:43.400]
Joe Collins.

[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:43.920]
Sure.

[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.000]
Yeah, you bet.

[01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:45.700]
Like how much?

[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.440]
I don't know.

[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:46.960]
I know.

[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:47.920]
I'm having a nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.060]
I'll see you in the New York.

[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:50.380]
Who?

[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:51.660]
I don't know.

[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:53.320]
Now, what's your question for Bill?

[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:54.180]
Who?

[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:57.480]
Let's go with one who, uh, that's your sword.

[01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:57.900]
Yeah.

[01:17:59.100 --> 01:17:59.460]
Hollywood.

[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:00.480]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:00.980]
Okay.

[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:03.120]
Hey, I've last year at Chirua.

[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.840]
As you tell me, calling you next Chirua, so.

[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:07.240]
I'll share a coming next Chirua, WIOD.

[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:09.400]
Yes, let's speak to Bill please.

[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:10.000]
You bet.

[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.080]
You know who he is?

[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.160]
Uh, Bill Coler.

[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:12.580]
That's right.

[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:12.840]
Good.

[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.920]
Well, he's here right now, sir, and he's desperate to talk to somebody

[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:16.960]
knows who the hell he is.

[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:17.320]
Okay.

[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:18.420]
Because we sure don't.

[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:18.820]
Thank you.

[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:19.820]
Go ahead.

[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:20.860]
Hello, Bill.

[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:21.600]
Yes, sir.

[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:22.180]
How are you?

[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:22.960]
Oh, great.

[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:29.020]
Um, do you think we can talk, um, heavy or light?

[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:30.180]
What?

[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:30.800]
Heavy.

[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:32.060]
What do you want to talk about the Middle East?

[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:33.320]
I'll take Middle East.

[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:34.100]
Yeah, I'm on the chart.

[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:35.080]
Yeah, man.

[01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:36.460]
People coexistence.

[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:39.100]
Yeah, let's talk about that grape stain on Grubochau's head.

[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:42.480]
Maybe the Soviets can lick on that for a while.

[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:43.380]
You're the good-natured.

[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:44.200]
You're just going down.

[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:45.260]
Yeah, what the hell is this?

[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:46.200]
Is this a fun color?

[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.300]
Or, you know, the one with these morbid douchebags, sir?

[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:52.300]
Bill, Bill, do you want to talk politics?

[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:54.120]
Yeah, that's up his house.

[01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:54.560]
Sure.

[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.700]
Boy, that's my strong suit.

[01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:58.640]
This is the red horse of the apocalypse.

[01:18:58.640 --> 01:18:59.640]
Do you remember me?

[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:05.360]
He's giving me a blank look like who the hell are you?

[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:06.920]
I'm going to be a twilight zone.

[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:07.720]
Oh, listen, sir.

[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:08.180]
I hate that.

[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:10.260]
I hate to move on, but we have an important call here.

[01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:13.920]
You're not going to believe who's on a phone now, who we heard, uh,

[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:15.920]
concerning with, uh, what's your name this morning?

[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:16.860]
I'm WQAM.

[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:21.560]
All right.

[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:22.660]
Think of Debbie Ellis.

[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:24.120]
Okay, we got that fish in your mind.

[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:24.380]
Right.

[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.440]
Big fat.

[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:25.620]
Right.

[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:26.220]
Fat.

[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:27.220]
Rotund.

[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:29.100]
Is that a good clue?

[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:30.000]
Mike.

[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:30.680]
No.

[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:32.660]
You're going to pay Lou any messages?

[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:34.600]
Oh, my God.

[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:36.040]
How you don't bill?

[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.780]
Uh, hold me.

[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:38.300]
How are you?

[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.040]
That's enough of that.

[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.280]
Bill, how you feeling, buddy?

[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:40.720]
Okay.

[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:41.280]
I feel great.

[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:42.320]
And I want to tell you something.

[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.440]
Lou, who I love is not going to leave on.

[01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:49.300]
Why is passing me by Lou and Lou gave me a bottle of champagne.

[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.220]
And I think that I was going to open it up when I moved back into my house.

[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:54.800]
Yeah.

[01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:57.720]
And, uh, I still haven't opened it.

[01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:59.420]
How about when you get your next show?

[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:00.420]
Yeah.

[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:03.960]
That's at a day's 10 to 2 on 610 WIOD start on this week.

[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:05.640]
You know, I'm not allowed to talk to you.

[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:06.380]
That would be terrific.

[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.080]
That's correct.

[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:08.220]
That's the luck to you.

[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.040]
But they don't say thank you so much Lou.

[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.660]
Think of dance all the way, baby.

[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:12.320]
Thank you.

[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:13.740]
Easy go, boy.

[01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:14.640]
Desperate third.

[01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:16.640]
Pretty disappointing for his backers.

[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:17.480]
But then what do you expect?

[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:18.960]
The full of his money are soon parted.

[01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:19.300]
Miami.

[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.560]
On the vocal line.

[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.140]
Is it gone?

[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:23.720]
Okay.

[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:24.280]
Very good luck to you.

[01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:24.800]
All right.

[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:25.060]
It's 11.

[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.720]
Till then we're going to do our last break of the hour.

[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:27.860]
At the ball game coming up.

[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:28.060]
Right?

[01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:29.820]
Is everything okay at Mark Light Stadium?

[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:30.880]
Everything's okay.

[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:31.540]
Hunky Dory.

[01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:32.280]
The game is on.

[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:32.780]
Fist.

[01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:34.600]
What was passed?

[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:35.820]
Well, almost done.

[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:37.380]
I'm not a chance to say anything.

[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:38.740]
Why have you eaten anything yet?

[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:40.220]
No, I'm going to.

[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:40.860]
I'll ask you.

[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:41.100]
I do.

[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:42.700]
These people respect your privacy.

[01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:43.760]
They want you to eat in peace.

[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:45.020]
They don't want you to be a slum like me.

[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.660]
Need on the air and then start grudging and burping on the air.

[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:51.060]
I'd have bring in some of your phone messages and play them on here on the cassette.

[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:53.160]
No, they get an idea.

[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:54.220]
Well, I'd be glad to see you.

[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:56.520]
I have a few of what I could use.

[01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:58.660]
Anyway, those of you who are just here.

[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:03.200]
They want to thank our friends at American Stake and Pizza.

[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:07.660]
They're 24-86 North Federal Highway and Lighthouse Point in the Freddie's Plaza.

[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:13.280]
They have raw wings and affiliate steak sandwiches and chicken and sauce and all kind of stuff here.

[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:14.840]
And you know this is not going to waste, right?

[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:18.520]
That you're like dribbling all over the place and they're chicken too.

[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:19.500]
Miami.

[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:20.580]
Hello?

[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:21.300]
Yes, sir.

[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:22.040]
Is this Neil?

[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:22.440]
Yeah.

[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.200]
I want to ask you a question.

[01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:25.580]
You want to ask me a question?

[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:25.980]
Yes, sir.

[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.100]
Does it have to do with our guests?

[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:27.640]
No.

[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:28.200]
No.

[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:29.800]
Okay.

[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:31.820]
Let's go to a deer field.

[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:32.420]
Yes.

[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:33.280]
Hello, Neil.

[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:33.820]
How are you?

[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.400]
When is this?

[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:38.060]
I want to ask you a question regarding Bill Colder.

[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:38.380]
Yeah.

[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:43.820]
If they woke him up at 2 o'clock in the morning, would he cook like Gabby Hays or like himself or what?

[01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:44.540]
Elmer Fud.

[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:46.540]
Let's go to a tamarack.

[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:47.520]
I'm dying over here.

[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:48.100]
Okay.

[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:50.040]
See these easier people starting to come in now.

[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:51.340]
Let's go to Hollywood.

[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:52.800]
Oh, yeah.

[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:53.660]
Bill.

[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:54.120]
Yeah.

[01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:56.380]
How about a problem?

[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.500]
Could you help me with it?

[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:57.960]
Yes, sir.

[01:21:59.020 --> 01:21:59.900]
What about life?

[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.220]
It's about a palm-peamatory gestulation.

[01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:02.980]
Oh, really?

[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:03.680]
Yes.

[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:04.080]
Well, listen.

[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:04.580]
Put it away.

[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:05.320]
We'll talk to you later.

[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:06.980]
Let's go to Broward.

[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.140]
Oh, I know who this is.

[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:12.060]
How's Tom Dworkos moving around so much?

[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:12.920]
Hold on, Jim.

[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:14.120]
W-Y-O-D.

[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:14.720]
Bill.

[01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:15.120]
Yeah.

[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:15.840]
How you doing?

[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:16.340]
Okay.

[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.100]
Hello, Bill.

[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:17.840]
Good memory, Donna.

[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.220]
What does it say?

[01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:21.220]
Still called her.

[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:21.820]
Oh, yeah.

[01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:22.580]
All right.

[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.240]
Hays is like doing bad radio, sir.

[01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:26.340]
He's eating on the air.

[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:27.800]
Oh, they all eat on the air.

[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.120]
They think they eat on the air.

[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:30.860]
It'll like rub off, you know.

[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:36.400]
Wow, it'll be nice to have you on from six to from 10 to two on Saturdays, Bill.

[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.280]
Yes, you're starting this weekend, I think.

[01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.100]
I hope so.

[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:40.020]
That's the rumor we're starting.

[01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:41.840]
Now I know why he brought me in here today.

[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.040]
Now I just don't done me when you were sitting there.

[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:44.700]
You sound great.

[01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:45.360]
You do.

[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:46.320]
You sound excellent.

[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:49.360]
If it don't Joey's chair real good there, would you bring a Bill Marshal to the lampage

[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:49.960]
your material?

[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:51.920]
There's a feature on how shots might.

[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:53.880]
Who is this?

[01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:55.520]
Who's your hot shot's might?

[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:58.160]
It's like you have those tapes?

[01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:00.260]
What a look of recognition on your face like.

[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:00.880]
Who the hell is it?

[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:01.920]
What tapes were they, sir?

[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:04.280]
Oh, tapes of all kinds of weird old music.

[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:05.060]
Oh, yeah.

[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.040]
Oh, yeah.

[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:09.780]
Now you remember, right?

[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:10.280]
Yeah.

[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:12.400]
What do you, don't say it.

[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:14.320]
You do.

[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.560]
Who's your hot shot?

[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:16.600]
There you go.

[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:19.440]
And that's not happening.

[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:20.400]
There's no hot shot, son.

[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:21.100]
I'll do it.

[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:22.780]
I just jumped in a chicken wing.

[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:25.960]
Oh, try one.

[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.240]
Just think that the who's your hot shot's got you all choked up.

[01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:30.400]
Listen, we're real short on pen.

[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:34.520]
We want to get to all these great colors before that big ball game in the sky descends.

[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:35.060]
All right.

[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:36.540]
Well, I hope that you're soon, Bill.

[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:37.020]
Okay.

[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:37.800]
All right.

[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:38.260]
See ya.

[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:40.540]
See it's a communist plot actually.

[01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:41.780]
Joey sent this stuff in.

[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:42.940]
Oh, this is good stuff.

[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.100]
Mobile in Pompato.

[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:44.880]
Yes.

[01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:45.560]
Hi.

[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:46.180]
Good morning.

[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.220]
Buenos dias.

[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.540]
I am from Hylia.

[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:53.040]
But anyhow, I just wanted to say hello to Bill and tell him I missed him.

[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:55.420]
He used to wake me up every morning at 6 o'clock.

[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:55.920]
Thank you.

[01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:59.660]
It's really good to hear that you're doing fine.

[01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:02.460]
Well, I don't know.

[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:08.060]
You know, I never did know what was really wrong with you.

[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:12.000]
I just knew that you went for some tests and then you got sick or something.

[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:15.220]
But I was OD on radio.

[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:22.040]
Anyhow, I just wanted to say I was nice to hear you on Neo Show and I missed you on the radio.

[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:23.260]
Thank you so much.

[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:25.180]
And I'm in the early Annabelle.

[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:25.900]
Okay.

[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:26.600]
Thank you.

[01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:27.300]
I'm Ray Lyon.

[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:27.620]
All right.

[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:28.040]
Bye-bye.

[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:40.280]
Wait a minute.

[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:40.900]
What is that?

[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:41.960]
What?

[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:44.820]
What is that?

[01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:45.820]
What do you want?

[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:47.660]
What the hell do you want?

[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:54.260]
Is it giving me like speed up, out time at 57?

[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:55.940]
You tell me that now?

[01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:57.520]
Why the hell didn't you tell me that before?

[01:24:58.180 --> 01:24:58.900]
You shmendrick?

[01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:00.140]
Why didn't you tell me that before?

[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:00.980]
It's not on there.

[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:01.780]
You don't believe it?

[01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:03.920]
We got like 41 seconds to say goodbye.

[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:08.240]
Well, thank you, Bill.

[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:13.740]
It's been a real of three to three hours and thanks for the opportunity to expose myself to you.

[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:14.280]
Okay.

[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:14.920]
Put it away.

[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:15.900]
The same to you, Pat.

[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:17.860]
The people that you've got to talk all over the building.

[01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:18.380]
Oh.

[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:21.340]
Speaking of that, the hurricane's going to take some serious ass.

[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:22.560]
They're going to be considered ill.

[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:25.380]
Hopefully coming up in a different couple of seconds here is a matter of fact.

[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.020]
Thank you, Bill.

[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:31.580]
And if they win, the second game of the championship game at 4 o'clock this afternoon, we pray we hope and Rick and Puts are playing.

[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.720]
They're in shul and honor of Shivu is playing.

[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:34.260]
Thanks, Rick.

[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.200]
For a hurricane, double victory today.

[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:36.540]
Okay.

[01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:37.000]
Any time.

[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:37.700]
I really enjoyed it.

[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:41.760]
I'll see you around the block, say hi to Bill's tool, and no, really.

[01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:42.380]
Thank you, Pat.

[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:44.000]
And don't forget to toast to it in your way.

[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:47.180]
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow at 10 here on 610-W-I-O-D.
