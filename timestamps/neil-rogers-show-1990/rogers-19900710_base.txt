[00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.620]
If I had the ability to do I take you out here right now kick your goddamn teeth in.

[00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.240]
Looks like some young guy has a new girlfriend, okay?

[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.160]
And he thinks she is the hottest thing since sliced bread, okay?

[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.660]
And gorgeous and just fabulous in every possible way, okay?

[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.880]
And he takes you out on a date and he runs into a couple of friends of his, okay, at Club

[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.240]
New.

[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.060]
New.

[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.080]
And they take him off the side.

[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.920]
And I say, you know, Joe, he's okay, but you know, she's got that like low on her cheek,

[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.780]
you know, and her ass is just, just not like one cheek is bigger than the other one, you

[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.940]
know?

[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:46.660]
And I just don't understand how anybody can be that like, oh, here's another one, he's

[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.560]
got it in the attic and he's in the basement.

[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.760]
Can you hear it?

[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.860]
Okay, good job.

[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.700]
Okay.

[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.400]
Okay.

[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.160]
Or is it an eight?

[00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.320]
Yeah.

[00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.300]
Fine.

[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.780]
Okay, now this ought to be pretty exciting, okay?

[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.500]
Oh, and through.

[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.560]
Okay, now just secondly, put that a hold on a year on and that's on.

[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.700]
I don't hear anything, do you?

[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.940]
No.

[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.140]
There it goes.

[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.940]
This could be great.

[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.280]
Or not.

[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.480]
And it's ringing in the nose.

[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.220]
It's not busy.

[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.220]
835 in San Francisco.

[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.060]
I just got up that early.

[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.080]
You're nobody.

[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.440]
They're not answering it.

[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.160]
Mom must be like, here, you didn't take any calls.

[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.360]
I can understand why.

[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.460]
Mom has got that live studio audience.

[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.060]
Right.

[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.360]
You're nobody.

[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.780]
Boy, I wonder if he's got a, like a border.

[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.340]
Or are you just sitting there holding it himself?

[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.160]
No.

[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.280]
You're somebody.

[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.980]
Love you.

[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.100]
You're nobody.

[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.220]
You're somebody answers the phone.

[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.700]
Come on, Alex, pick the phone up.

[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.580]
Well, yeah, now what are we going to do about this?

[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.040]
I don't know.

[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.400]
And this could be pressing.

[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.040]
I can't sound so early.

[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.120]
He does mornings.

[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.780]
Oh.

[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.880]
He does like six to eights morning dive.

[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.320]
Drive.

[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.000]
Just tune in when you said if anybody wants to call.

[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.760]
Oh, yeah.

[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.660]
In other words, you didn't hear the article I read?

[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.940]
No, no.

[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.760]
About how he's 50 years old?

[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.820]
No, I didn't hear that.

[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.820]
Now, he's only been, now, didn't he say when he was here?

[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.640]
He was 44.

[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.320]
And I kept saying he was lying about his age.

[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.320]
Now that he's back there, he's admitting to at least 50.

[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.280]
Well, he was, well, first he was what, 48, then it became 44.

[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.580]
Yeah.

[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.800]
And then when he left, he said he was like 36.

[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.720]
And now all of a sudden he's 50 again.

[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.040]
Except he's not even there.

[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.940]
And I'll be honest with you, between you and me,

[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.440]
it could pass for 60 easy.

[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.840]
OK.

[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.940]
No, seriously, he's got like a wrinkled up head

[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.660]
and he looks like he said a rough line.

[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.740]
I saw him.

[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.240]
You were here?

[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.720]
Yeah.

[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.200]
Well, I'm going to call it back a little while

[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.160]
because that's annoying here.

[00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.100]
That ran.

[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.600]
Easy instructions on how to get the most information

[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.420]
out of your radio each morning, dependably.

[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.960]
When you tune into 610 WIOD every weekday morning,

[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.180]
you can expect to hear complete and accurate weather

[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.860]
information four times an hour.

[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.420]
Tune in at eight minutes after, 15 after, 25 before, and 15 before.

[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.480]
We do this so no matter when you tune in,

[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.500]
you're less than 15 minutes away from a complete and accurate

[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.340]
weather forecast.

[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.140]
You'll only get it here.

[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.840]
Weather information each morning at 8 and 15

[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.980]
after at 25 and 15 before from the station you can depend on.

[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.500]
News talk radio 610 WIOD.

[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.640]
When the radio comes, I'm from beautiful North Bay Village

[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.700]
where he was busted by the police department

[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.800]
for being a total loser.

[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.220]
It's a salute to our Spanish.

[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.560]
The man who constantly exercises neck

[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.060]
by looking over his shoulder.

[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.300]
The man from California who didn't have a tan.

[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.900]
The man who founded great fun to rip his fellow workers.

[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.540]
But when ripped himself turned into a smithling, crying,

[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.920]
complaining candy ass.

[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.760]
The man who finally chose some semblance of intelligence

[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.860]
when he packed his bags and got the hell out of town.

[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.100]
One of the few men who could actually go back to an old job

[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.480]
in an old town telling old jokes and doing even older bits.

[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.080]
We salute you, Alex Bennett.

[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.080]
South wind has never seen a bigger paranoid.

[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.040]
A bigger backstabber.

[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.920]
A bigger cry, baby.

[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.240]
Alex Bennett, nor a complete asshole.

[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.760]
All right, a little salute to our man in San Francisco.

[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.100]
We're going to continue trying to calm because it's only like

[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.340]
9 o'clock in the morning out there.

[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.200]
Stay tuned for the news.

[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.820]
We'll be back.

[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.220]
Now let me ask you a question.

[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.220]
Why is it that when you call lines busy?

[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.980]
Every time I call, I get right through.

[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.620]
It's like calling this show.

[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.280]
They never any busy lines get right through.

[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.280]
Come on, Alex.

[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.240]
Pick up the phone.

[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.420]
I know you're old, but crawl over to the phone

[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.100]
and pick it up.

[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.340]
Will you?

[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.800]
Man.

[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.820]
Have somebody in the live studio audience pick up the phone?

[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.980]
Yo, nobody.

[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.420]
This is a guy who graduated high school at the age of eight.

[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.180]
He became a brain surgeon at the age of 11.

[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.880]
He left here.

[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.920]
He was 44.

[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.340]
And in just three months, he's turned 50.

[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.200]
Let's see.

[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.820]
4 times 6.24.

[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.820]
That means in another year, he'll be 74.

[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.060]
And in two years, he'll be 100.

[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.140]
Even the Fuzla couldn't match that.

[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.900]
I'm calling the right number.

[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.480]
I know that.

[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.460]
It's not busy.

[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.280]
And nobody answers.

[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.360]
And he's got a boring show.

[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.320]
Now let me ask you a question.

[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.660]
If I put that on hold, is there nothing?

[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:19.120]
What?

[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.280]
What is she shaking her?

[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.540]
What the hell do you know?

[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.960]
If I put that on hold, do we feed the program on hold

[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.200]
on the bat line too?

[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.380]
OK, so I'll put it on hold.

[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.800]
And just in case they pick it up, they'll know what's here.

[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.500]
Which would be great.

[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.300]
It'll piss them off.

[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.140]
You're calling what?

[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.820]
For a sonny.

[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:39.140]
Or...

[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.060]
Yeah, that's a number.

[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.440]
That's what I just dialed.

[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.840]
Meathead.

[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.060]
What?

[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.620]
You're calling it busy?

[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.440]
In other words, you don't think I can dial the damn phone.

[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.340]
Is that what you're saying?

[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.440]
I think if it's a contest between you and me,

[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.460]
I don't think it's...

[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.060]
We need to take a vote.

[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.780]
Kendall.

[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.120]
Nail.

[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.400]
Yeah.

[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.020]
Till Alex rubs your forehead.

[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.500]
Duh, duh, duh.

[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.080]
I'm afraid of what?

[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.660]
If you ever rubbed his forehead, you'd have to start at two o'clock

[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.100]
in the morning and go to a noon.

[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.060]
Here's a forehead from his chin to his poop.

[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.200]
11 afternoon at WYOD, where we have a morning show in the morning,

[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.640]
a midday show in the midday,

[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.900]
an afternoon show between two and six.

[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.200]
We give the time, the weather, the temperature, the sports scores,

[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.980]
and all kinds of information.

[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.680]
And a lot of corny ridiculous promos

[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.140]
that our consultants think are going to really dazzle you,

[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.160]
because they're boring and terminal.

[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.700]
How come they don't answer at the switchboard either?

[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.160]
Boy, I'm telling you, what a station they got.

[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.940]
I thought we were efficient here.

[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.540]
All right, let me try one more number here.

[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.340]
All right, six to five.

[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.140]
I mean, this place, they're all out to lunch

[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.120]
and it's only like 10 after 9 a morning out there or something.

[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.680]
How far good morning?

[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.620]
Yeah, I've been dialing the...

[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.620]
This is WYOD in Miami, New York, New York.

[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.720]
Roger's calling, we're on the air.

[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:07.520]
Uh-huh.

[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.260]
And we've been dialing on the airline

[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.340]
to try to get a hold of Alex Bennett, our good buddy.

[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.060]
Uh-huh.

[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.860]
And nobody answers the phone.

[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.980]
All right, hang in there.

[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.280]
Let me see what I can do for you.

[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.180]
Yeah, just for a second.

[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.720]
Are you Nick?

[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.200]
I'm Nick Rogers.

[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.820]
I know, you just called, right?

[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.520]
No, this is Neil Rogers.

[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.120]
That was Nick Lawrence, I just called.

[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:26.960]
Okay, hold on.

[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:27.980]
What was Nick doing?

[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.600]
He was calling, he was calling asking to speak to, um, lawyer, Alex.

[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.360]
And I had to inform her that they were doing the show

[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.640]
or something that would pass with them.

[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.640]
Well, we're doing a show too.

[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.960]
You and I are on the air right now.

[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.140]
We're just pretty exciting, right?

[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.140]
Well, that's great.

[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.740]
In Miami, even though Alex didn't like it,

[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.340]
we're not that bad.

[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.180]
Let me find out what's going on.

[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:46.560]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.900]
Let me ask you a question.

[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.420]
You want to ask me a question, okay?

[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.140]
Is that okay?

[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:50.800]
Sure.

[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.080]
What's the temperature there today?

[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.380]
The temperature right now is about 60,

[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.360]
oh, about 65.

[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.820]
It's rough human here in the city.

[00:08:59.480 --> 00:08:59.480]

[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.400]
And it's going to get up in the 70s today,

[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.740]
which is like a heat wave for you guys.

[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.820]
Yeah, plus it's human.

[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.100]
We don't use the health community.

[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.640]
Well, it's like 87 here now.

[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.380]
Of course, it's 1213 here.

[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.640]
It's only 913 there.

[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.560]
Uh, we actually had a thunderstorm

[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.580]
and lightning in the south bay last night,

[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.520]
which is the rear.

[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.320]
Man, it sounds like pretty lousy weather.

[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.160]
Well, it's, it is lousy.

[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.180]
But, you know, it's exciting to us right now.

[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.860]
So how's Alex doing?

[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.700]
So how's Alex doing?

[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.860]
He's setting the world on fire there,

[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.180]
right? He's very big in San Francisco.

[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.960]
Yeah, he's doing pretty good.

[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:27.700]
For an old guy.

[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.000]
Yeah, he's doing pretty good.

[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.520]
Right now they think, um,

[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.300]
I don't know, some, we had a long show today,

[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.000]
and I don't know what really was happening,

[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.640]
but hey.

[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.420]
How about that studio audience?

[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.000]
The audience is good.

[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.180]
They've been pretty quiet though this week,

[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:41.920]
yesterday and today,

[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.580]
but usually they get kind of rowdy

[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.520]
and they get really excited and stuff like that.

[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.320]
But it's a good thing that they have going.

[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.160]
Yeah, well, like how many people come in every day?

[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.500]
Uh, let's say it's about 20,

[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.220]
as much as the studio can hold,

[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.260]
the studio isn't that big.

[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.020]
20 sun?

[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.520]
Uh, maybe one, not a, about to maybe 15.

[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.060]
How about like, can we go for five?

[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:01.960]
No.

[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:02.780]
No, I'm just kidding.

[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:03.160]
I'm poor.

[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.780]
You wouldn't like it.

[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.580]
And like, what are these like,

[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.060]
because the show starts at what,

[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.280]
536 in the morning?

[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.620]
6, 610, yeah.

[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.780]
So these people come in, what time?

[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.500]
Um, they usually, I guess, get here about to quarter of.

[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.700]
Quarter of 6?

[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.120]
Yeah.

[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.780]
And they line out, you know, I came by.

[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.060]
What are they like, street people?

[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:21.960]
Is that it?

[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.400]
Oh, wow.

[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.500]
I think what it is most of them are basically

[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.980]
to work in the evening or students or something.

[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.620]
Or the generous.

[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.720]
It's a different crowd.

[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:31.220]
Yeah.

[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.500]
I think, boy, you really have got that place pagged out.

[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:35.700]
How long have you been working there?

[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:36.980]
Um, I just came in.

[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.300]
I just came in about.

[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.080]
Oh, well, that's why you're so refreshingly honest.

[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.560]
About three weeks ago.

[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.740]
You haven't brainwashed you yet,

[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.120]
and they're giving out a lot of phony propaganda.

[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:44.940]
Right.

[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:45.440]
I used to, I used to.

[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.580]
In other words, you're doing okay.

[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.960]
But you wouldn't say.

[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:48.900]
I used to work in radio though before.

[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:49.840]
Another station.

[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.900]
What station was that?

[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.160]
Um, well, I...

[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:52.940]
Well, you can say it.

[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.160]
I mean, we're not on the air in San Francisco or on the air in Miami.

[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.140]
Oh, wow.

[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.440]
Are you still at KIA?

[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:58.160]

[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.400]
Okay. Well, that's a big station.

[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.520]
KIA, can you say for a while?

[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.300]
Well, the most Syracuse used to work there.

[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:02.740]
Right now.

[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:03.560]
You do?

[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.740]
Yeah, I know.

[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.920]
Did you ever, did you ever hear Joey Reynolds?

[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:07.660]
No.

[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.820]
Oh, thank God.

[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.240]
Is that you?

[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:09.820]
No.

[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:10.980]
I'm Neil Rogers.

[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.040]
You never heard of me either.

[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.160]
Oh, okay.

[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:13.660]
I hope.

[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.340]
Unless you listen to Alex bash me on the air out there until...

[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.520]
No, no, he doesn't bash.

[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.020]
No.

[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.520]
Alex loves Miami, don't he?

[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:20.800]
Yeah, he does.

[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.440]
No, he doesn't.

[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.520]
He hates us like poison.

[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.340]
He does love me.

[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.460]
No, he just celebrate what he's doing.

[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.800]
He just missed a barrier, I tell you.

[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.660]
He just celebrated.

[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.660]
He missed the gay area?

[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:30.980]
He's celebrated.

[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:31.380]
He celebrated it.

[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.160]
That's part of our show you should not say.

[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.500]
That's part of your show?

[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.840]
That's part of what he's going through this morning.

[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.540]
What is that?

[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.340]
Some article went on the air or something and...

[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.380]
What about how he does all that?

[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.060]
Some article was written and...

[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.720]
How he does all that gay bashing on the air out there?

[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.180]
Oh, yeah, and it's actually not him.

[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:45.740]
It's some...

[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.560]
We have different communities.

[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.960]
It's all those like Andrew Dush Clay and the...

[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.860]
All those people, Sam Kinnison, all those slimeball homophobic people.

[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.600]
Oh, oh, oh.

[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.900]
You don't go on here and...

[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:54.520]
Yeah, I'm going for it yet.

[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:55.120]
A bigger burden?

[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.800]
You should be in San Francisco right now.

[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:57.500]
I should?

[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.020]
Yeah.

[00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:58.820]
Why is that?

[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.400]
They probably shoot you.

[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.260]
For what?

[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.580]
For what you just said.

[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.180]
They don't...

[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:03.760]
Well, not...

[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.560]
I'm not saying the whole San Francisco is like that.

[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.620]
For what did I say?

[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.020]
Probably get phone calls.

[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:09.780]
Andrew...

[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.080]
Where would you say that is?

[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.320]
Andrew Dush Clay.

[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.000]
Andrew Dush Clay.

[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.200]
Well, what's wrong with that?

[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.420]
That's like said with affection and love.

[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.200]
Oh, okay.

[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.500]
Now, anyway, you sidetracked me.

[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.120]
I can...

[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.880]
I talked to people like you before.

[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.100]
You like put me off on a witanja when I was really getting the heart of the matter.

[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.540]
Okay, so do you think we can get them on the air for a minute?

[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.280]
Well, yeah, let me try, okay.

[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.680]
Let me try to find its producer for you.

[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.160]
Yeah, and listen.

[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.900]
When you say neo-rodgers and if he starts throwing things,

[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.420]
don't get hysterical, okay?

[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.100]
Because he's a very emotional man.

[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.480]
I'll just tell him, look, I had a great conversation with him.

[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.020]
Yeah, we had some fun here, right?

[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:40.600]
Yeah.

[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.020]
I'll just tell him I had a great conversation with you.

[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.560]
Let me find him, okay?

[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.660]
Can I ask you a question?

[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:47.180]
Yes.

[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.960]
Because you and I have been talking now for what?

[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.820]
About four or five minutes?

[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:51.280]
Yes.

[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.100]
And am I keeping you from any other calls that are coming?

[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:54.760]
I can't believe it.

[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.720]
It's not ringing.

[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.340]
I know.

[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.020]
And if it's like a commercial radio station, right?

[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.560]
This is real.

[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.140]
Or is this just like a high school station or something?

[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.040]
Are you holding on my clothes or something?

[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.000]
Yeah, we put them on hold.

[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:07.500]
Did you?

[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.020]
All right.

[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.100]
Now let's see what Alex does.

[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.300]
Let's see when you mention my name.

[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.620]
I want to find out what kind of object he throws.

[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.720]
Let me run in there now and tell him why he's not in there.

[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:15.620]
Okay, because he'll go nuts.

[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.360]
Hang on.

[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:16.880]
Hang on.

[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.080]
This is great.

[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.140]
God, I haven't had so much fun since Joseph Yankee went left for vacation.

[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.040]
It's 1217 and WYOD.

[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.540]
We do have some open lines here.

[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.100]
I'll tell you that.

[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:27.980]
People are dropping off.

[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:28.920]
Now I got news for you.

[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.620]
If you think I'm going to preempt this great call for a lot of your crap,

[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.060]
you're dreaming.

[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.080]
We haven't talked to you anytime.

[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.640]
Is this not the show?

[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:37.140]
Does he play music?

[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.020]
He plays...

[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:40.880]
Why should I ask?

[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.680]
I thought...

[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.380]
What does he do?

[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.160]
In other words, he doesn't do a talk show.

[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.000]
He never did a talk show.

[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.200]
Oh, these bozos here, man.

[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.180]
They brought this guy in.

[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:49.960]
All he does is that...

[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.700]
Reducing is coming.

[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.720]
He'll be right with you.

[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.180]
Don't fall.

[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:52.760]
Wait a minute.

[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:53.500]
Are you busy?

[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.440]
Yeah, I have to answer another call.

[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:55.800]
Okay.

[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:56.480]
Hold on.

[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.000]
Okay.

[00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.340]
You're on nobody.

[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:00.780]
Feel somebody.

[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.000]
I better get the right cards in the machine now.

[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.660]
Somebody loves you.

[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.200]
Oh, nobody.

[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.260]
Feel somebody loves you.

[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.460]
Get in the right mood.

[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.500]
You're nobody.

[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.780]
Feel somebody's hurt.

[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.620]
If I had the ability to do, I'd take you out here right now.

[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.280]
I'm taking your goddamn teeth in.

[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.080]
Here?

[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.120]
Yes.

[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:24.400]

[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.380]
Lori, how you doing?

[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:27.960]
I'm fine.

[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:28.860]
Let me hold on a second.

[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:29.740]
Yeah.

[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.140]
Take me to the back.

[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:31.880]
Down the water.

[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.120]
Yeah, cut that back a little bit back there.

[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:34.940]
We want to hear Lori.

[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.740]
We don't want to hear all that rock is rock.

[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.040]
Right, Lori?

[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:39.720]
Yeah.

[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.980]
We don't want to hear all that noise.

[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.680]
We call to speak to you.

[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:44.320]
Okay.

[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.860]
So what's going on, Lori?

[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.340]
Am I on the air?

[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.380]
Yeah, we're on the air on WIOD and Miami.

[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.240]
Alex's favorite station.

[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:51.920]
I see.

[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:52.460]
I see.

[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.840]
And there's this big article that somebody brought in from the Marin

[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.960]
Independent Journal, which I guess is one of your really big papers.

[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:00.820]
Yeah.

[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.840]
But it's actually been numerous papers.

[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:07.680]
Yeah, Alex is just that he was on TV, I guess, on Friday or last Friday.

[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:07.980]
I don't know.

[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.020]
He's just all over the place.

[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:09.600]
It's amazing.

[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.620]
And since he loved Miami so much and such a big fan of the station and me in particular,

[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.240]
I thought we'd call him and check in with him.

[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.260]
Well, actually, Alex can't talk about because he's on the air.

[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.940]
But I'm on the air too.

[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.700]
Well, I know, but he's going to be sure right now.

[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.620]
I don't think it'll really be appropriate at this time.

[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.440]
But I do appreciate your calling.

[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.460]
Boy, are you like blowing me off, or is that what you're doing?

[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.200]
I am because he can't really do it right now.

[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:32.660]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.140]
Did you tell him that I was on the phone?

[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:34.860]
He knows.

[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.000]
He knows I'm on the phone and that's why he won't come to the phone.

[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.000]
He said he doesn't do Smiley Markets.

[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.000]
He doesn't do smaller markets?

[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.020]
Well, I have his resume here and it seems to me that he once worked in Reno, Nevada.

[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.220]
Well, I'm just on the phone.

[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.400]
In San Rafael.

[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.120]
That's just what he told me.

[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:53.980]
Yeah, Alex.

[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.220]
I appreciate your calling anyway.

[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:55.760]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.240]
In other words, you're ending the conversation here because I have to get back to this.

[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.680]
So I can't ask you like what kind of a show he does out there.

[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.620]
He plays a lot of music or...

[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.060]
No, we do love it interviews.

[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.980]
But you don't really take phone calls on the air.

[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:08.660]
I'm sorry?

[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.080]
I say you don't take any calls on the air?

[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.520]
On the change we do.

[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.700]
But you just don't get many, right?

[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.200]
We do at times.

[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.080]
We can't really take all the calls because, you know, we're in a conversation with celebrities.

[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:19.700]
Right.

[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.700]
Well, like who's on today?

[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.340]
We had Roger Craig.

[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.020]
We had just one neighbor on the other day.

[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:24.380]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.460]
Like Roger Craig from the Giants?

[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:26.720]
Right.

[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:27.880]
Uh-huh.

[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.680]
Well, that's pretty exciting.

[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.480]
Well, they're doing it.

[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.300]
They're doing it.

[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.580]
Yeah, they're moving up a little bit.

[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.160]
And you had who?

[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.580]
You had Cisco and the E-Bird?

[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.260]
One E-Bird?

[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.040]
Boy.

[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.740]
Boy, you guys don't monkey around.

[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.280]
Well, tell them we're going to work real hard so one day we can work in a big market like that too, okay?

[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:44.060]
Okay.

[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.980]
Give them a big kiss on it, forehead, and tell them happy 50th birthday.

[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.020]
That's all right.

[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:48.440]
Okay.

[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:48.940]
Thank you.

[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.460]
Bye, Laurie.

[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:50.300]
Okay.

[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.040]
What a piece of crap.

[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.840]
A 20 afternoon at WID.

[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.540]
You know, it was a run of hope.

[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.100]
You didn't talk to smaller markets.

[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:57.960]
I got news for you.

[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.240]
The biggest market you were in in your life was publics.

[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:05.580]
Anyway, we have an open line in Palm Beach at 655 in the fruit section.

[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.100]
655-9463.

[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.620]
And we also have star IOD.

[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.360]
Talk to Cisco and E-Bird and Roger Craig.

[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:12.880]
Woo!

[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:13.960]
And the same day.

[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.880]
Boy, we had what the hell we need that.

[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.940]
We had Mike DeCello from Midway Airlines on it.

[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.140]
We don't need that crap.

[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:21.600]
Boy, oh boy.

[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.960]
So in other words, that...

[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.020]
Now, does that sound like a little hostile call to you?

[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.900]
I mean, would that be the understatement of the century?

[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.540]
Just a wee bit of hostility?

[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.300]
God, that sounded like talking to Rick Edwards.

[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.820]
21 past noon at WID.

[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.720]
And let's ask you a little question here.

[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.380]
Are you sick and tired of paying through the nose?

[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.040]
A guy who can't even have a little bit of fun.

[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.580]
A condescending mong head.

[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.820]
That's what we're dealing with, okay?

[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.840]
Okay, we've got lots of open lines.

[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.940]
I know that took a long time.

[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.820]
We've been screwing around, but that's too bad, okay?

[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.500]
Because to me, there was a lot more entertaining than talking to a bunch of skinheads.

[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:56.880]
We have an open line in Broward, 524WIOD, 1 in Palm Beach, 655 Fowler,

[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.740]
and the star IOD, of course, it's $400 a minute.

[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.220]
Let's go to a mobile and four-letter mail.

[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.420]
Wh...

[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.680]
You're still there.

[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.600]
I can't believe it.

[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.440]
I can't eat it.

[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:07.920]
I must do.

[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.500]
But it was well worth it, though, wasn't it?

[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.700]
I got a cheap car phone.

[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.440]
I can afford it.

[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.260]
I mean, what an experience that was.

[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.920]
Star I'm experiencing, Alex.

[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.740]
She sounded like his twin sister.

[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.260]
Surrily, hostile, inhospitable, humorless, psychotic.

[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.100]
God, I'm glad he went back.

[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:24.760]
You should have stayed.

[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.100]
He's done well if he continued.

[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.000]
Boy, I tell you, those people out there, they really know their entertainment, don't they?

[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.760]
They know the hot stuff when they hear it.

[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.500]
Alex's problem is I don't think he knows what big is, Renel.

[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:35.940]
He doesn't know what?

[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.300]
He doesn't know what big is.

[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.360]
Well, I don't want to get into his personal life.

[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.080]
Well, I know.

[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.460]
Oh, well.

[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.420]
That's what I tell you.

[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.340]
It's the greatest bitch you've done since you've been back.

[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.360]
Wherever the hell you went.

[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:45.700]
Yeah.

[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:46.320]
Okay.

[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.800]
I'm still trying to figure out what the hell's going on.

[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.340]
Well, I was in San Francisco, hanging out with Alex in his crowd.

[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.260]
I thought I had a good time.

[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.560]
Must be very careful, Neil.

[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:53.160]
See him.

[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:53.620]
Take care.

[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.460]
26 past noon at WIOD and opening in Broward 524WIOD.

[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.060]
Who's that on the bad line?

[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.520]
Is that Alex calling back begging for our forgiveness?

[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.680]
That's a private corner.

[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.080]
WIOD.

[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.780]
Hi, I'm Conquaniel.

[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.100]
Sure.

[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:06.460]
Hold on.

[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:07.460]
WIOD.

[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.920]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:09.240]
Great.

[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.140]
Hey, listen.

[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:15.240]
You just got me in the mood for this, um, Neil Bogd for what?

[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:19.700]
For this, uh, what did they call it, uh, movies with their slack on top of the bread?

[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:20.900]
Letterbox, letterbox.

[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:21.940]
Come on, get weathered.

[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.460]
What kind of a slob are you?

[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.660]
I'm ready to do an expert.

[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.840]
I want to go watch a letterbox movie and send a coffee house, listen to beatnick music.

[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:30.240]
Yeah.

[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.380]
And ams to them.

[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:31.820]
There you go.

[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.580]
Moking heavy, heavy duty crap.

[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.840]
Hey, I never even seen a letterbox.

[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.260]
Smoking soap on a rope without the soap.

[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.020]
What is it?

[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.720]
He talked about that letterbox every day.

[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.140]
Well, I don't want to bring that in there.

[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.780]
It's like, uh, it's kind of like letterman.

[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:44.680]
It's the same thing.

[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.760]
It's like DCs.

[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:46.280]
Yeah.

[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.500]
All right, Neil.

[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.340]
I wish you would have got a hold of him, right?

[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.740]
No, to be honest with you, this was more fun.

[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:52.400]
It was.

[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:58.220]
In other words, we got the same effect without having to put up with his whiny, uh, crappy bull.

[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.040]
What did you say we can't speak to people in small markets?

[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.800]
He doesn't do small markets.

[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.240]
And he's got something that's small as a market.

[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.100]
Yeah, that's correct.

[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:07.940]
Have a good day.

[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:08.980]
Holden wrinkle, too.

[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:09.880]
And I don't mean his forehead.

[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:10.480]
See ya.

[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.100]
28 past noon at WYOD.

[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.080]
There's an opening in Broward.

[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.660]
If you move real fast enough, you want to get down on the hit parade.

[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.940]
And if you're real nice to me, I'll give you a Steve's numbers again from WABC.

[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:21.640]
That's cruel.

[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.560]
Why am I doing that?

[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.420]
Because I don't really have any big deal with Steve, but, uh, Puts wants to hear him again.

[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:32.060]
And of course, Puts wishes he'd have been in here to talk to Alex because he's one of his favorites.

[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.520]
He is so fond of Alex.

[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.300]
Uh, I got to see you.

[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.120]
Are you seeing this article?

[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.460]
When you get to that part about his 50th birthday, you'll really enjoy that.

[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.880]
And he's still, he likes Alex so much he has that picture of him right in his briefcase.

[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.980]
The one with the circle around it and the bullseye right over the middle of his forehead over that big bald spot.

[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:50.000]
Hollywood.

[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:51.180]
Hello.

[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:51.840]
Yes.

[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:52.480]
Hollywood.

[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:53.520]
Isn't that a...

[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.240]
No, this is Neil.

[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.300]
No, that's Neil.

[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.460]
This is Hollywood.

[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.320]
Sir.

[00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.100]
Neil.

[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.360]
The amateur comics go on the Alex Beddetson.

[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.280]
I realize you've been...

[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.920]
You're right because I've been...

[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.100]
Oh, you're not nice.

[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.280]
We'll bring Eric Lambert back in with, uh, what's Larry Bremler?

[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:12.780]
No, I'll do that.

[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.480]
Would Larry Bremler in stereo?

[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.140]
No, I'll do that.

[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:16.600]
Okay, Neil.

[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.160]
Yeah.

[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:17.600]
Two things.

[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:18.740]
Where's Gilbert?

[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:21.920]
What is that supposed to be?

[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:22.400]
Yeah, all right.

[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.080]
Second off, on, on, on the point of Gilbert.

[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.740]
No, I don't want to, I don't want to discuss Gilbert.

[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.900]
Gilbert will be at our remote on the, uh, 24th of this month over at, uh, the stadium up there.

[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.560]
And we're doing the, another miracle game.

[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.400]
I just want to let you in on a little hint here.

[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:36.860]
Yeah.

[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.300]
He's been giving out stock tips.

[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.420]
And I've gotten two from him so far, and they both went up.

[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.700]
Well, I'm delighted for him.

[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.760]
Tickle to the second.

[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:44.740]
Call me green.

[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:45.680]
No, no, no, no, no.

[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.520]
I don't like her.

[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:51.080]
We have an open line in date, 751 Gilbert, 751, uh, yeah.

[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:51.580]
Uh, yeah.

[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:51.960]
Neil.

[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:52.980]
What do you want?

[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.240]
W-2-A-M.

[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.040]
This could be the worst call, even worse than Super Dave.

[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.180]
Okay, and that's saying a lot.

[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.660]
This is one of the worst calls in history.

[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:00.880]
W-Q-A-M.

[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.840]
We're talking about other people.

[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.740]
Talk about yourself.

[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.080]
They went to fishing.

[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.240]
Stopping like a quizzling, stopping an underling of other people.

[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.600]
Be a be your own person.

[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.860]
If Q-A-M went to 50s, does that mean IOD is going to 60s?

[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.660]
And NWS is going to 70s?

[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.880]
We're going to 1860s right after this call-ins, which is right now.

[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.580]
1230 at W-I-O-D.

[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.900]
Three open lines in a board.

[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.760]
Boy, which we were as popular as Alex Bennett.

[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.540]
What I wouldn't care.

[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.120]
I left my heart.

[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.840]
We have an opening on the star IOD line at $4,000 a minute.

[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:42.460]
If you have the guts to stand out in the crowd, see all you people are doing is hanging back and waiting for the day that I come on a year and say,

[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:49.900]
Hey, Bell South mobility finally got their finger out of their butt, and they got their act straightened out, and you can call that line and we pay for it now.

[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.660]
Now I got news for you.

[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.940]
We may not live that long.

[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.080]
Okay, any of us.

[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.800]
So I wouldn't hold back and wait.

[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:56.620]
Kendall.

[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.840]
How you doing?

[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.520]
Okay.

[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.200]
Hey, you know what?

[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.360]
Shortsman hasn't improved at all.

[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.100]
Shortsman?

[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:03.600]
Yeah.

[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:04.800]
That is Shortsman.

[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:05.480]
That's correct.

[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.220]
There you go.

[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:06.720]
Yeah.

[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.700]
And you know what?

[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.340]
Is producer?

[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.520]
She's great.

[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.340]
She's almost as similar.

[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.920]
Yeah, almost as pleasant as he is.

[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.560]
Yeah, we're Nick Lauren.

[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.340]
What a bitch.

[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.740]
No, I had got news for her.

[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.400]
Nick is a prize compared to her.

[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.480]
Oh, they're out there.

[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:26.840]
I mean, Nick wouldn't have wasted all that time and had just said, dropped in and hung the phone up, but she enjoyed digging and clawing.

[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.160]
Well, I have to get back in there and go in the air.

[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.100]
I think I'm going to, you know what I'm going to do in a few minutes.

[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:38.140]
I'm going to call the switchboard operator back up because she hasn't been there very long and she's the only one friendly enough to give us the real info.

[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:38.900]
There you go.

[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.180]
Because when I said, I hear he's setting the world on fire.

[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:41.720]
How's the show?

[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.700]
Oh, pretty good.

[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:43.060]
Pretty good.

[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.200]
Like, you could tell the way she's set it.

[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.200]
Like, they're not, you know, knocking the doors of the Golden Gate Bridge down there.

[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.340]
Well, how's the man?

[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:51.680]

[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:52.520]
There's something in the map.

[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.040]
I have to say whether it's going to be a year.

[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:59.380]
I heard there's a rumor that he's going to be doing the show with the live studio audience from Alcatraz that they're going to reopen it pretty soon.

[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.540]
Yeah, that's a good idea.

[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.200]
That's a great idea.

[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.220]
You know, Roger Craig.

[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.360]
I'd pay to watch that.

[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.540]
Yeah, Roger Craig is as big as comeback has been it.

[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.340]
Now, why would you say that?

[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.600]
Just because he's got a big snows like Joey is it?

[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.280]
I mean, he's a good buddy of Don Zimmer, so he can't be all bad.

[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.060]
Even though he's a boring guy.

[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.800]
You don't show someone up at the all-star game.

[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.880]
A boring guy and he brings out his own guy, Bradley, to lose the game for Cranae Island.

[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.640]
That was pathetic.

[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.060]
Anyway, let's not discuss baseball.

[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:32.980]
Okay, my team is one, two games in a row where she were just glowing in the aftermath of another great victory.

[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.240]
And we're doing it, boy.

[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.940]
We're only 16 games behind in about, I think, 15 under 5, 14 under 500.

[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.920]
What's wrong with that?

[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.820]
I'd rather watch the Cubs on a bad day.

[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:46.400]
We're full game ahead of the Cardinals and the hottest race in the National League.

[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.760]
We're a full game ahead of St. Louis.

[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:48.840]
What do you want from us?

[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.180]
Yeah, you don't mention the Cardinals, eh?

[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.880]
Well, I'd like to mention them a lot.

[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:55.380]
What a piece.

[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.540]
Just to remind everybody that they're a lot worse than we are.

[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.640]
And then, of course, there's the Yankees who are like 19 games under 500.

[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.680]
Or no, 23 games, I think.

[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:09.120]
Well, listen, can you give Bennett's new address on the air at that radio station so I can send him a piece of right-

[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:13.080]
Yeah, just send it to Alcatraz, Siamford, Cisco, California. It'll get there.

[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:18.840]
1233 at WIOD. There's an opening in date, 751 Bennett, 751 Alex.

[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.300]
Here's a mobile on the IOD line at 10 grand a minute.

[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.120]
Yes. Good afternoon, how are you, Neil?

[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:25.660]
Pretty good.

[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.620]
I have a question for you, please.

[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.580]
My wife finally getting into the show.

[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.140]
And I'm taking it this afternoon to get a Corvette.

[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.200]
Of course, a white one which you don't like the color.

[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:37.740]
Yeah.

[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.680]
I have never...

[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.280]
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Who doesn't like the color?

[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:47.880]
Well, it's standard colors. I didn't get the green or whatever. I'm getting whatever most people get.

[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.580]
What's wrong with the white one? White Corvettes are beautiful.

[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:51.680]
Okay, well...

[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.740]
I have a white Corvette.

[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.460]
I, well, that's what I like. All my cars are white and this is another one.

[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.280]
Pedestrian.

[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.720]
I have a question, please.

[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.140]
In other words, you're kind of a boring guy.

[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:00.560]
Oh, well.

[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.180]
That's all right. You probably like vanilla ice cream, too.

[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:03.740]
Yes.

[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.280]
Vanilla bean speck ice cream like Johnny Dark.

[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.520]
Which I still have at my house from three summers ago.

[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.780]
But my question, please.

[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:12.160]
Yes.

[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.520]
2000 mile demo, untitled.

[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.860]
About what should it go for?

[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:20.460]
Untitled.

[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.180]
Untitled.

[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.560]
It means that they were driving it around.

[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.880]
Rather, you know, the wherever the deal was driving it around.

[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:28.780]
Yeah. Right.

[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.240]
What is it, a coupe?

[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.020]
Yeah, with the top that comes off.
