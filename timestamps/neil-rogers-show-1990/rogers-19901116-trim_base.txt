[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]
really need calls today will take a couple here in there but boy this article by

[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.580]
ken ratter regays in a herald this morning

[00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.700]
and pay for the beer

[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.500]
the most stupid article i think i've ever seen and said that's covered a lot of

[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.320]
ground in the herald

[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.080]
goldberg makes night of it talk host gives up security

[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.180]
for more willing for a freewheeling format and we'll get that minute

[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.980]
speaking of sports

[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.560]
uh... i must say and i say with chagrin with egg on my face because we've

[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.080]
you know when you're in this town you get had over at over and over

[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.880]
and uh... this hockey thing they had the press conference finally yesterday

[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.620]
afternoon

[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.380]
and uh... all of a sudden the guy who was supposed to be the big financial

[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.540]
backer was supposed to have backed out tonight before now he's back in its

[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.580]
the old in and out

[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.240]
if we can say that

[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.100]
and godfrey wood now he's belly aching about well the only problem is we've

[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.880]
only got a little under five thousand season tickets all

[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.240]
well you had a little under five thousand tickets all

[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.700]
shortly after the game here they whipped up all the enthusiasm we all got

[00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.780]
excited said in the money

[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.580]
and then we're sitting in waiting

[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.940]
and if he thinks in these next three weeks they're going to get another six

[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.280]
thousand people to send in money for season tickets

[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.380]
they're not

[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.380]
because uh... the credibility factor at this point is minus infinity

[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.680]
so if the uh... national hockey league decides to give us a franchise and

[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.580]
could be because of godfrey wood in this group of mysterious in a closet

[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.980]
people

[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.200]
it'll be a miracle okay

[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.780]
we're still a name from the baseball team up there from uh...

[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.900]
mike veck we had a calm the mimey miracle

[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.260]
because that's what will be if we get the hockey team i have

[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.180]
well i should say i've never because i've seen it over and over and over again

[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.960]
in this town all of this time in the beginning

[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.340]
it appeared

[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.480]
that just maybe they had to craft together and uh... we had the game and it went

[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.520]
off i mean we had some ice problems but nonetheless we packed the arena was

[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.000]
great everybody was enthused

[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.480]
and now you just have that feeling that you've been had again you know what i

[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.140]
mean mister wood godfrey

[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.020]

[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.960]
with the dollars for comilla souse in the homeless this year and that's great

[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.740]

[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.820]

i notice you've been in anything we bring in here is not mister choosian air

[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.260]
mister uh... professional cuban in the a control room

[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.140]
anyway talk host gives up security for more free free or freewheeling format

[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.920]
this is the most stupid bunch of crap

[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.300]
first of all i call bird works for beber silver steen is got more money than

[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.060]
god he makes more money at the track every week that most of us making a

[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.740]
damn life time i think that the beer exactly

[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.540]
and uh... the the he writes this article is though hank has been making a living

[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.520]
his whole life is dependent on doing a couple nights week on that in

[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.040]
ciphad stupid sports talk show rally talk about is the dolphins and hurricanes

[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.960]
and ignore all the real sports

[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:03.080]
anyway the bombastic voice booming out of your w.w.w.s sports talk radio dial

[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.180]
has been silenced he writes outrageous gone and with a day stream of sarcasm

[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.800]
cynicism one-liners and double on tans

[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.780]
i paid for the beer hank goldberg yaps no more between six and eight p.m. beginning

[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.620]
to the heaps from eight to eleven p.m. on his own show goldberg at night

[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.120]
now wait to listen to this

[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.680]
what this means for listeners of south florida's highest rated sports talk

[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.660]
radio show is a gentler friendly or less controversial program what this means

[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.720]
for callers is less provocation is this guy nuts

[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.340]
a kinder gentler hank goldberg this man's nuts i paid for the beer

[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.440]
and it goes on and on and out says the loss of goldberg south florida's most

[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.100]
compelling sports radio personality will hurt but sports talk will survive

[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.400]
and it alters line up slightly and goes out of this big thing about jose a gaki

[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.040]
who went to boy giri and recommended that hank do eight to eleven at night trying

[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.800]
to get because uh... joe wants him off that sports show that's obvious

[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.660]
he's tired of being shown up and it even goes in here it says the gaki and goldberg

[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.660]
are fast friends but sometimes there was enough room on the show for both of

[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:04.900]
them

[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.680]
i thought sometimes i hindered hank got in his ways a gaki said sometimes he can

[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.480]
be very domineering

[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.380]
there were times where he would take over the whole show in the worst thing you

[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.600]
can do is get in the way of it

[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.700]
i think hank is going strong enough to carry the ship at night i think he's

[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.600]
going to be magnificent

[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.360]
and a couple of other quotes in here too about uh... how the where's that other

[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:23.840]
quote

[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.900]
oh yeah he says uh... we're going to have content will be stronger than ever

[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.080]
zagaki says the people to an effort to address style your full of crap joe

[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.860]
they like hank

[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.160]
they think you're boring

[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.280]
and uh... then the guy goes on and on about sports talk and he's tremendous

[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.120]
ratings it about uh... the highest rated sports talk show about about about

[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.940]
i mean sports talk it's like threes okay

[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.180]
once in a while to make it a four they get like threes

[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.500]
no problem

[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.260]
anyway

[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.620]
well listen i'm under a lot of pressure here today

[00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.860]
i just don't understand this and then he goes on to say uh... the move is a

[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.200]
gamble for goldberg this is the part i love he leaves the security

[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.580]
of the markets highest rated sports talk show for a slot in the dark

[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.240]
i didn't pay for the beer a three hour period that you an average of only sixty

[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.080]
eight hundred listeners twelve and older per quarter hour in the latest ratings

[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.300]
book sports talk to an average of twelve thousand four hundred per quarter

[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.180]
hour from six eight p.m. whoo boy

[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.140]
will be

[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.700]
big deal

[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:28.900]
i mean sports talk in this market is a limited thing okay this is just not a sports

and the people like that

[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.900]
i mean this is just dumb

[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.660]
dumb and of course the fact that he's taken over a slot that's been dying over

[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.080]
here means he's got to improve it and what is the big deal in addition to

Oh, what?

[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.460]
Andrew Dice Clay Fire Report.

[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.060]
W-I-O-D, what do you want?

[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:44.880]
Oh!

[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:45.860]
Yeah.

[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.500]
Anyway, there's a thing out there in West Alberta, Canada.

[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.700]
See the referees in the junior vacuoleague?

[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:53.940]
Yeah.

[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.160]
Have an enduro tape of Andrew Dice Clay saying,

[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.460]
Unbelievable.

[00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:58.820]
Hey, roll it.

[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.620]
Don't be talking about my good friend, Neil Rogers, like that.

[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:03.260]
Oh!

[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.560]
When they rule against the Cess catcher on blazers?

[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.080]
Yeah.

[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.880]
They play a tape of Andrew Dice Clay and now the guy at the top says

[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.300]
they can no longer do it.

[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:13.980]
Oh!

[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.440]
So he's out.

[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:16.280]
Wow.

[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:17.580]

[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.940]
So what kind of a world is this anyway?

[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.000]
This is the Arctic Airman.

[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.000]
Oh, yeah.

[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.300]
How you doing? How's your ears?

[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.140]
My ears are just a little waxy build up.

[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.260]
I can't hear a sign in a garfunkle yesterday on the radio for the 400th time.

[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:37.380]
You know the thing of it is, I like Simon in a garfunkle, but after the first 2000 times Cesselia gets a little old.

[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:37.660]
Yeah.

[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.960]
I found together back in 68, just the two of them in one guitar.

[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:41.760]
They were just unbelievable.

[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.220]
They're great.

[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:42.780]

[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.980]
But I've never seen Art Garfunkle in the one of the hotels out in Omaha when you were doing the College of World Series.

[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:56.060]
And they were doing all this construction in the hotel and he was just bent out of shape in psychotic and carrying on and rightfully so, by the way.

[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.960]
I guess old friends, you know?

[00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:58.640]
Yeah.

[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.540]
But how about that Millie Vanillian?

[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.200]
That's something.

[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.860]
Air Zots, pal.

[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.040]
The thing is, what you think it is, okay?

[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.340]
They got to give that Grammy back.

[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.380]
It's really Dave Gamer and Debbie Ellis did the music to that, but they couldn't get him in the studio for the...

[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.460]
No, they couldn't get him in the studio for the video so they had to get a couple of people smaller.

[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.260]
Unbelievable.

[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.720]
Yes, sir. That's what the Dice Man would say.

[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.060]
Oh!

[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:21.080]
The Neil, I-75, Anne's right at 136th Street.

[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:21.720]
Yeah.

[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.200]
It just ends there. You just get off and just go east.

[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:25.380]
Really?

[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:26.140]
Yeah.

[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.460]
I thought it was 138th.

[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.620]
Well, it ends there.

[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.860]
It's a grant New York reticulate.

[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.460]
It turns into 138th?

[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:32.380]
Huh?

[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.360]
Well, like magic.

[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.800]
You're on it and all of a sudden, it's like 163rd turns into 167th.

[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:43.300]
No, 136 turns into 139th Street and Highly is 133rd.

[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.460]
You know, you people over there in Highly and Miami Lakes, you're so screwed up, you don't know what's going on.

[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.080]
Yeah, it's the best thing.

[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.540]
They got a whole bunch of names for every street just in case they figure one of them might be right.

[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.240]
I got the map right here and you should be okay if you just go right to the end.

[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.000]
You got the map?

[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.140]
Yep.

[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.820]
Well, we got Randy Martin over here.

[00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:58.580]
Let's make a deal.

[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.680]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.500]
All right. Talk to you later.

[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.220]
North Miami.

[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:07.820]
The other day I called and got chewed out by you because I asked you about your separation from your wife.

[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:08.820]
I didn't get chewed out.

[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:09.960]
I didn't get chewed out.

[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:10.440]
I didn't get chewed out.

[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.480]
I don't know how to tie the plug or what to what to do.

[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.060]
Okay.

[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.640]
Now I would like to put my two minutes worth in without interruption from you.

[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:17.780]
Okay?

[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.560]
I'll be the judge of that.

[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:20.440]
And since I got the...

[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.800]
Can't stand a heat gun, I'll be kidding.

[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.620]
I'm amazed by your career.

[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.880]
You were living in the fairs, plain in Miami.

[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.440]
Gambling, passing beer checks.

[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.380]
Never now, hold on.

[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:29.620]
Stop.

[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.000]
Never did that.

[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.300]
So you start off wrong.

[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.600]
It's good night.

[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.620]
I got to be right in the ocean.

[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.780]
Oh, man.

[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:41.840]
Oh, God.

[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.240]
Never gambled, never passed a bad check.

[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.580]
Never told a lie.

[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.320]
No wonder he's got that panochino.

[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.000]
Look at that.

[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:48.680]
Oh, man.

[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.260]
They got two cameras now, Adleri.

[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.380]
Just to keep track of that nose, it's growing so long.

[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:53.600]
Unbelievable.

[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.620]
You can't stand a heat gun out of the kitchen.

[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.680]
That's what I always said.

[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:57.800]
Wow.

[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.780]
You notice how he sends them on their way real fast?

[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:01.620]
I mean, like...

[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:02.440]
Bingo.

[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.400]
Can a day when New York, hello?

[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.420]
Silvestre Silone, strapping on a guitar instead of an automatic weapon.

[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.840]
It's the Rolling Stallones.

[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.900]
When I blow you up.

[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.920]
When I blow you up I just can't stop.

[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.800]
The Rolling Stallones.

[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.940]
I know.

[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.420]
I'm only Rocky Bible about a Laker.

[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:27.320]
That's true.

[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.320]
Or that gross millions.

[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.640]
The music that grossed out millions.

[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:31.800]
Here it comes.

[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.860]
Here comes my 19th Rocky movie.

[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.920]
Here comes my 19th Rocky movie.

[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:43.640]
Here it comes.

[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.440]
Oh, man.

[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.640]
Rocky Part 500 this weekend, right?

[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.940]
Which goes to show you the Dumbord is, the biggest mashing is just looking to reckon

[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.340]
such show it to this afternoon.

[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:52.980]
Hollywood.

[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:53.480]
Hello.

[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.400]
Oh, you're there.

[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.300]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:55.840]
Okay.

[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.160]
This is Adam from Miramar.

[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.740]
Boy, you're a little slow on the uptake today, Adam.

[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.980]
If you guys hadn't had a host by the hour I had to click over and call a friend and see what was happening.

[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.000]
Well, what was happening?

[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.140]
Nothing much.

[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:08.640]
Okay.

[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.780]
I had just a basket full of material today.

[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.100]
You had a basket full?

[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.380]
Yeah, I was listening to that very...

[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.700]
I'm not touching that line, Adam.

[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.340]
I was listening to the Larry last night and I heard that.

[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.680]
Probably Marvin was over there in Miramar sticking things...

[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.400]
Well, go ahead, I'm sorry.

[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.560]
And I heard the section on OpenFullers America that the caller played earlier.

[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.100]
Yeah.

[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.240]
And I almost fell off the roof.

[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.280]
That was the best.

[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.000]
It was.

[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.280]
We got to have that on tape.

[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.060]
I mean, when I read both his books and he just said...

[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:34.500]
Never did that.

[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.140]
Never did that.

[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.740]
He says in his books that he had gambling problems.

[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.920]
You know, that he was bankrupt and had to leave town.

[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.940]
And I ought to say that he didn't do it.

[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:43.980]
And then to do it that.

[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:45.440]
Oh.

[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:46.980]
Is he...

[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:47.860]
Can I make a complaint?

[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.340]
Yeah.

[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.840]
You know how late at night lifting to IOD...

[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.560]
You used to hear those promos of Berniery and yourself and Rick and Sud.

[00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:58.120]
Yeah.

[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:58.760]
What happened?

[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.060]
What happened?

[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.540]
I don't hear them anymore.

[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.260]
I have no idea.

[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.720]
I'm not exactly listening to IOD at those hours of night.

[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.160]
You know what?

[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.160]
Well, I have a company.

[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:08.940]
I have a heart.

[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.080]
I'm sleeping, so I have to.

[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:10.600]
Do you?

[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.360]
Why is that?

[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.160]
I don't know.

[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.440]
I guess it worked too hard.

[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.920]
Speaking of which, you know I've got the new job at Service Merchant.

[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.700]
How's it going?

[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:19.540]
It's okay.

[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.240]
I listened to you while I'm there and I'm off the day.

[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:27.900]
But yesterday I had you playing and this lady came up and she's about 80.

[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.500]
And who is that?

[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.320]
I've asked Neil Rogers, oh, why does he talk that way?

[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.780]
I wouldn't listen to him for a second.

[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:36.540]
Yeah, right.

[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.560]
And then my manager comes up and says, well, we're sorry about that, ma'am.

[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.120]
But this is the official radio station of Service Merchant.

[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.960]
You almost fell out of her chair.

[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:46.780]
Outstanding.

[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.740]
It was something else.

[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.940]
Stick her in Mount Sinai and give her some soup.

[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.180]
And don't give her a map.

[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:52.560]
Right.

[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.880]
But listen, so my donations coming in for coming with house.

[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:57.260]
Great.

[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.940]
I got your letter that you sent me in the mail and it was okay.

[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.160]
Yeah, why great, but it was okay.

[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:03.460]
Yeah.

[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.280]
While you were watching Notch Landing.

[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.720]
No, I was not watching.

[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.420]
Well, why are you...

[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.280]
Well, while I was thinking about how glad I was that I was missing it.

[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.180]
Okay, I was watching my first Jeff Stryker movie.

[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:14.420]
What?

[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.240]
Yeah.

[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:16.960]
Oh, man.

[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.840]
No wonder he couldn't sleep all night.

[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.880]
Hey, let me tell you, let me give you a name.

[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:24.780]
Francois Papillon.

[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:25.400]
Yeah.

[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.720]
He's got...

[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.280]
...on a scale of 10, 86.

[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:29.740]
And a half.

[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:30.440]
Mm-hmm.

[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.500]
Well, I have to measure that closely.

[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.360]
And, uh, well, that's something I think about, huh?

[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.420]
Okay, probably brings back some memories from the movie.

[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.580]
Yeah, let me ask the question.

[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.300]
Yes, Adam, ask anything you like.

[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.960]
Did you move here that you were talking about?

[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:47.460]
What was that?

[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.240]
The name of it?

[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:48.680]
Network?

[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:49.860]
Network.

[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.000]
You haven't seen...

[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.260]
I mean, you act like...

[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.980]
I'm 19, without 15 years ago, give me a break now.

[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:55.680]
Network?

[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:56.460]
Yeah.

[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.800]
Your life is meaningless until you've seen Network.

[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.160]
Well, oh, I read the day Palon's book.

[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.660]
This has got nothing to do with that.

[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.660]
Will you forget about Jeff Stryker for just a minute?

[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.360]
It's got nothing to do.

[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.620]
I'm telling you, you must see Network.

[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.440]
Okay, I'm going to go out there and rent today.

[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.640]
The entire world, all the truth of the world, is right there in that movie, okay?

[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:16.900]
See, can you show fine?

[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.820]
Is it like something I can watch around the family?

[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:19.840]
Like what?

[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.620]
Something I can watch with the family.

[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.840]
With the family?

[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.040]
Yeah, with the rest of my family.

[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.680]
I mean, it's not a porn-o movie, but it's got some...

[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.800]
It's got some language in it, but it's great.

[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:30.620]
Okay, they can do that.

[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.920]
Nothing they haven't said to you probably last couple of days.

[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:33.340]
Yeah.

[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.000]
Oh, and you know that that, uh, the couple got killed a few days ago?

[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.760]
You know, that's right up the street from where I live.

[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.380]
It's like I can throw a rock there from my house.

[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.460]
Well, that's very depressing, Adam.

[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.360]
Well, it is, but I just thought you'd want to know.

[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.160]
No, I don't want to know. It's depressing.

[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:47.980]
Well, it is.

[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:49.840]
But, um...

[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.060]
Adam.

[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:51.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:51.740]
Butchah.

[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.080]
Hey, can you give me another book?

[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.640]
Last time I talked to you, you gave me the day-pollon book and I wanted it.

[00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.580]
And I read it.

[00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.880]
So, give me another book to read.

[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.740]
Go out and get the movie Network first.

[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.320]
Okay, one thing at a time.

[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.220]
Go out this weekend.

[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.740]
One thing at a time.

[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:09.620]
Okay.

[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.660]
Have a good day.

[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:11.060]
See you.

[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.060]
Oh!

[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:41.220]
Oh!

[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.580]
W-I-O-D!

[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:46.920]
W-I-O-D!

[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.060]
What do you want?

[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.000]
Oh!

[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.240]
How you doing, there?

[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.920]
Well, what a greeting that was, Alex.

[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.840]
Well, is this, uh, this isn't all the mayor, do you see it?

[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.740]
Hey, I bought those made-belieze.

[00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:57.720]
You got it all sorted?

[00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:58.820]
Wow.

[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.120]
Well, we did a big day yesterday.

[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:00.760]
What is it?

[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.200]
How about they made-belieze?

[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:03.640]
Yeah, they're hot.

[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.480]
They're at Detroit tonight.

[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.940]
They're playing the Red Wing.

[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:09.720]
Wow.

[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.640]
Kind of a mediocre amount of mail today, I would say.

[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.320]
Although this can't be all of it.

[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.280]
Hey, no, you're too bad.

[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.080]
We're going to cut up that tape, finally.

[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.160]
Did I sent you?

[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:18.680]
Did I take it?

[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:19.600]
What tape?

[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:19.660]
What tape?

[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.440]
It's still in the cupboard.

[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.220]
Just relax.

[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.100]
Just the wall.

[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:23.960]
What are you going to do with it?

[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:24.400]
Sell it?

[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.080]
You and Rick Sanchez together.

[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.800]
Boy, wouldn't that be-can you just hear that?

[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:30.740]
Yeah, that'd be great.

[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.940]
Alex Jr. and Rick Sanchez singing...

[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.020]
Oh, God.

[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.020]
Oh, we can sing.

[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:37.700]
Oh, we can sing.

[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.940]
All right, doing the 10 o'clock news, you know?

[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.600]
You just sit on top of that table there.

[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:50.800]
And wait till the stars move out.

[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.160]
Oh, man, I can't handle it.

[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.360]
It's just too emotional for me.

[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.760]
I heard what's his name like the Old McDonald's.

[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:02.880]
Did you see network?

[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:03.580]
Yes.

[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:04.980]
Oh, boy.

[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.280]
Of course I saw network.

[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.040]
Who has it?

[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:08.180]
And...

[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:08.880]
Great movie.

[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:10.620]
What are the greatest along with the gun?

[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.680]
I'm sure I'm putting my window right now and screaming.

[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:13.140]
Yeah.

[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.000]
I'm at his hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.

[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.900]
Well, he said something else over the air, which I won't repeat.

[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.680]
Yeah, he said crap.

[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:22.380]
Right.

[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.480]
Or something like that.

[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:23.940]
Yeah.

[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.860]
He said life is bull crap.

[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:26.840]
Right.

[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.320]
With an S.

[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.560]
Right, bull...

[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.220]
Yeah, that's what he said.

[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.280]
That's what he said to Superman.

[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.820]
Life is bull crap with an S and he looked down on his chest.

[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.100]
He said, hey, you're right.

[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:36.900]
Hey.

[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.220]
Okay, Neil.

[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:39.920]
That's it.

[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.640]
I have no more material.

[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:42.940]
Captain Marvel was Canadian.

[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.620]
Woody has said Shazam, a...

[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:45.800]
Boy.

[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:46.740]
See ya.

[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:48.380]
1243.

[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:50.460]
All right.

[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.660]
Now I know I played that whole other cup, but as long as I found the CD today, I did not

[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.180]
found it, but I kind of like dug it out.

[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.060]
Can we hear like little bits and pieces of some of these other cuts?

[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.340]
Because we haven't heard the deal Frankie, the Dion stuff.

[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.020]
In a very, very long time.

[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:04.660]
In fact, so long.

[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:05.080]
He said, hey, I'm going to be a little bit more serious.

[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:05.080]

[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.100]
I want you to step on it here.

[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.440]
I think a helicopter, all of a sudden.

[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.240]
You notice, kind of, backed off on it all.

[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.420]
Oh, I'm taking this home.

[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.560]
It's the plant lady.

[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.980]
Hey, here she is.

[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.580]
She's ready to win that 30 million in a lottery this weekend.

[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.120]
Let me ask you a question.

[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.260]
If you win the 30 million, will we ever see you again?

[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:29.880]
Really?

[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.320]
One last time.

[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.100]
How is she going to do something wicked on those plants that one last time?

[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.320]
And then she'll take off for never to be seen again.

[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.300]
Pop it out.

[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.980]
Oh, it's the clicking line.

[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:40.540]
I love it.

[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.400]
Like I said.

[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:45.100]
There is a single thing that I wouldn't do.

[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.500]
I'm trying to get...

[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.640]
Boy, I tell you one thing about John Hambrick at Channel 6.

[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.800]
He has excellent taste.

[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.840]
Not only does he sit next to Giselle Fernandez,

[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.460]
pipping shorts on the news every night, but he loved this album.

[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.340]
And actually, grace this with a call.

[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.200]
I wonder how many people remember that.

[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.780]
What we were playing this in Hambrick called in was blown away.

[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.720]
And went out with his own hard earned bucks.

[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.340]
He only makes what, two, three million a year,

[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.200]
and bought his own copy of it.

[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.360]
What a guy.

[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.180]
What did I say?

[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.360]
We're going to fans, my door, fans.

[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.360]
Well, that's been a long time.

[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.280]
We're choosing sides to keep the case.

[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.620]
We're really back to seeing those kids.

[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.040]
We're not so far away.

[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.380]
Okay, he's no Rick Sanchez, but he's okay in our book.

[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:30.860]
Cutler.

[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.620]
Let's take a call from Vegas.

[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:34.300]
Behind you.

[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.680]
You're in Vegas?

[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.560]
Yeah, and I'm on the other line calling back.

[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.020]
I'm on both lines now at once.

[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.440]
What did it call back? What?

[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.820]
I'm going to hang up on that one.

[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.000]
I was on hold here for a while.

[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.020]
I didn't know if you got to me.

[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.180]
Hey, we got to you right now, sir.

[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.300]
A great American in Vegas and a real living,

[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.100]
and breathing, and shaking, and quaking place.

[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:50.900]
He's doing it.

[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.280]
You got it, but it was great here.

[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.520]
Where were you standing?

[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.020]
I'm standing right now outside.

[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.840]
No, no, no, no, not where you're standing.

[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:58.720]
Where you're staying?

[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.720]
Oh, I'm staying at the Mirage.

[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.040]
At the Mirage?

[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:02.720]
Where you're standing?

[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.620]
I'm standing at the payphone outside the Hilton.

[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:07.300]
Wow.

[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.080]
So how's the Mirage?

[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.700]
How is the Mirage?

[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.140]
The Mirage is beautiful.

[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.860]
They had the volcano last night.

[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.380]
The, uh, the panel is just booming.

[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.420]
They had a gigantic eruption at the, uh, Mirage last night?

[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.040]
They what?

[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.820]
I say, uh, you're having a great time.

[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:23.800]
Yeah, all right.

[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.220]
I could only hope it was me, right?

[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.380]
But, uh, I'm not sure.

[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:27.440]
You're making any money, of course, not.

[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.560]
You're making a nice donation.

[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.180]
Actually, I did pretty good.

[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:31.780]
I won $60.

[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.920]
So, for me, that's a, that's millions ahead.

[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.180]
You won $60?

[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.260]
That's right.

[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.560]
I know somebody, uh, sitting right here

[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.920]
would like to have a little piece of that, sir.

[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.800]
Yeah, but, don't be 50 dollars.

[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:48.300]
I'm out here doing my show, and I've got a show on Sunday,

[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.620]
since there's no dolphin game.

[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.440]
I'd like to plug it.

[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.160]
Okay.

[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.540]
At the North Miami Beach Auditorium.

[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:54.960]
Don't be 50 dollars.

[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.900]
What is it?

[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.160]
Carousel.

[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.320]
What is it?

[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.260]
At the North Miami Beach Auditorium.

[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.260]
Three o'clock, Rogers and Hammerstein's carousel.

[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:02.820]
Okay.

[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.860]
That's what I'm out here doing, providing entertainment for this week,

[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.480]
at the big convention.

[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.040]
But I missed you.

[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:13.820]
Yeah.

[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:19.500]
Anybody in Vegas who misses anything about this place,

[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.440]
whether it's this show or, uh,

[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.460]
or the early bird special is really, uh,

[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.440]
you know, yielding the lily, sir.

[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.100]
But you know what's funny about it, since I've been on home for the last hour,

[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.880]
so it gave me a chance, and you really, you don't think about missing your show

[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.680]
while you're out here, because there's so much to do.

[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.100]
Yeah.

[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.920]
It's only when you're holding it on the phone.

[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.740]
But once you get back into the swing, and you walk back inside

[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.340]
and get out from that pay phone, and you realize that there are all these people

[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.820]
having a great time in the bells flashing, and lights going off,

[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.900]
and the belly dancers running around are all the naked people,

[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.800]
and, uh, it's just a different story.

[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:50.660]
Yeah.

[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.200]
Well, listen, have a great weekend.

[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:52.860]
All right.

[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:53.060]
All right.

[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:54.900]
And a great life.

[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.020]
All right.

[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:56.020]

[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.220]
Boy, why is he in Vegas, and I'm here?

[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.060]

[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.100]

[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.020]

[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.100]
Not just might be, but some of us are heading for Vegas.

[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.260]

[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.200]
with three thousand drug reps

[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.440]

[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:31.700]

[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.980]
there must be... I mean I run into

[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.580]
the decline of all drug reps all day

[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.680]
so there's at least about

[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.360]
two hundred of us in the day

[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.500]
in the Broward County area

[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.260]
who at least matched that contribution

[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.860]
if not more because there's plenty of people

[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:13.820]
that make more money than me

[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.020]
of course I only felt felting

[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.640]
by the way speaking of that

[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.360]

[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:14.180]
We ain't doing our dog. I know it's just a joke, but Alan insisted. I said hey, I'm cheap. I'll take it

[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:18.800]

So what else what else is going on?

[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.240]
It's about it. Yeah, man. That's a size of it

[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:04.500]
All right, as I say in the backstreet. That's about the size of it

[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:10.480]
All right, so how about that Joe Pavia and Mickey McNichol, huh? Yeah, Mickey Rose jumping on their source

[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.760]

[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:33.120]
But Kelly Shepherd is perfect for the meeting so far a perfect and I looked at that one horsey at last night in the 11th race

[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:36.620]
And I immediately said to myself the streak is safe

[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:40.160]
