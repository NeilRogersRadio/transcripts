[00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.520]
You don't need to have that. You need to have numbers tell you that you're great.

[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.580]
Miami. Meal. Yeah. I'm not a client services. Can you put it back in a home?

[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.880]
Okay. Well, that's what you're waiting for. Would you give him off already? Please.

[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.840]
He's your friend. Who? Russ O'Reilly? No, he's not. He's going to buy airtime here.

[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.860]
He's defending himself. Now, can you imagine a guy that's going to ask me?

[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.280]
We don't put screaming spots on from tentative, okay? He's going to buy airtime.

[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.820]
I wanted to fan myself. For 800 dollars. He called me last time. He wanted to know he was going to write a commercial.

[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.620]
Tell me why. And if he pays me a million a year, I'll go. What's the story?

[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.440]
And how he offered you a job and wanted to give you a piece of the station and wanted me to buy a piece of the station and work for peanut.

[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.560]
Well, what's wrong with that? It's a business deal. Stan wants you to put a network down the air and you're going to be a part of that too.

[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.760]
Stan Roberts. So you bring him up again?

[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.520]
Mono. Vicious vindictive. Vindictive. Stan Roberts. Stan Van Roberts.

[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.820]
Stan Roberts. And Robert.

[00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.160]
And Robert goes back to him. Nice guy. Jewish. That's why he didn't like me.

[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.260]
And to my wedding. David Woods. Good guy. Good guy. Good guy. Nice guy.

[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.000]
It was glass. You step on it. It was waterfront. North Miami Beach.

[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.440]
How are you this morning? Okay. This is like the Lincoln Douglas debate here.

[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.760]
What you guys? I thought we got him.

[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.560]
He was throwing stones this week. Temperaries. How it's turned is a piece of garbage around.

[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.800]
No one. He's a lot of piece of garbage. But that's your opinion.

[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.140]
Yeah, well, if you'd run a little bit about sports, maybe people would like to open you too.

[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.320]
I don't know a lot of us. I was raised to worst. I don't know a lot of us for something.

[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.840]
Could you fake it? That's possible. I'm going to make this like. I'm not going to do this.

[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.700]
I'm not going to do this like he knows that with orgasms. All right. There's not going to be any faking here.

[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.140]
Well, you know, it's wanting down. He's saying now he put out albums.

[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.380]
You might want to spin some of those bits. Great. I can't wait.

[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.980]
Work down. He's singing. Yeah, he's got an album.

[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.380]
He's growing up.

[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.360]
What a good spot.

[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.360]
Also, you guys take it easy because each group fit. I mean, you have good points and bad points.

[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.180]
Unfortunately, Joey's got more bad points than good points.

[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.140]
Well, I'm trying to learn from Neil. I was more hanging around with the better.

[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.800]
Yeah, I tried to kiss him a little. My guy won't let me kiss him.

[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.740]
What Neil's trying to explain to you is you've got to develop your own...

[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.640]
He's keeping your tongue in your mouth. Wait, next time? Yeah. Well, I like it.

[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:39.440]
Yeah, I'm afraid of that.

[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.520]
I mean, there's nothing wrong with you, Joey. You just...

[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.140]
You just... You just...

[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.980]
Joey, why do you think they call him Neil?

[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.420]
Joey is for the jolly, Vinzie, Pell, Doug.

[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.480]
Oh, is for the oblong shape of his head.

[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.620]
He is for excitement, excitement, excitement. And why?

[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.660]
Must be sleeping with Anne Bishop.

[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.920]
And not only that, I have something else to tell you, Rust.

[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.700]
What's that?

[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.140]
Ed, agency, people, and rancos.

[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.800]
Of a recipe that I first don't agree with you.

[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.000]
Yeah.

[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.440]
Is that right, Rust?

[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.140]
You don't need a lot of...

[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.000]
I've got a couple of things I want to square away with.

[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.400]
We all bet.

[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.580]
First of all, I want to know why it is that you say, um...

[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.100]
Gee, I got you. It makes a couple of million dollars in the audience.

[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.900]
And he does this. What's he doing at the end and around at the radio station?

[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.660]
Hey, is it not okay to have a couple of varied little talents instead of just one thing that you do at the time?

[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.500]
No.

[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.440]
It's not. No.

[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.920]
Okay.

[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.060]
Tell me what you're going to do. You're going to buy spots.

[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.720]
Well, I simply was going to buy a few commercials on your show.

[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.940]
Yeah.

[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.360]
You defend my own personal position.

[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.460]
Because you were attempting, you saw the enemy.

[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.140]
Neil, you were really hurting my field.

[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.140]
You don't sell screaming spots on this show.

[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.940]
You wasn't going to scream.

[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.300]
Well, he was going to talk nice about you.

[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.860]
Oh, sure.

[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.680]
Am I right, Rust?

[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.560]
Absolutely. Neil, you know, you're really hurt my feelings. Right there.

[00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.500]
Yeah. Well, I bet.

[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.100]
Tell me what you were going to say, Rust.

[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.060]
Wow, I was just going to say that.

[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.480]
Everything I'm saying now, friends.

[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.200]
Yeah.

[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:08.680]
Well, in that case,

[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.340]
1135, a WI of V.

[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.920]
Well, I'm not going to leave him on anymore.

[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.060]
Get the checkbook out, pal.

[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.640]
That's it.

[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.820]
He's really worked for this company.

[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.500]
I want to see a bigger profit margin here.

[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.680]
And I got something to tell you off the air that I know that's a secret.

[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.560]
And I'm going to share it with you.

[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.760]
But I don't want to say to somebody.

[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.400]
No, I know something that you need to know.

[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.340]
Because I just...

[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.280]
Here's the plant lady.

[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.340]
What do you mean?

[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.060]
Why haven't I told you?

[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.300]
Well, by the way, she is not having a deal.

[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.440]
Like the better when they brought pictures.

[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.380]
Anyway, let's talk about fat Tuesdays.

[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.600]
Let's scream about fat Tuesdays.

[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.840]
Man, they got it down there.

[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.380]
They must have a drink for Joey down there, which one would it be?

[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.000]
Jungle juice.

[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.280]
Wayne Newton's picture on television.

[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.020]
What the hell is going on?

[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.580]
Pussy roll.

[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.960]
Headbutt.

[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.920]
Tropicalata.

[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.700]
Bahama mama.

[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.340]
Fuzzy naval.

[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.020]
I wonder what these are.

[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.480]
Headbutt is a good one for me.

[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.200]
The rough stuff.

[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.460]
Triple bypass.

[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.560]
It's right up your alley.

[00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.560]
57.

[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:00.600]
That's what I'm going to tell you.

[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.440]
That's what I'm going to tell you.

[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.460]
Anyway, you'll find all these in the world's largest selection of ingredients.

[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.360]
What?

[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.400]
Oh, I don't even have a card.

[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.480]
The woman just walked in there.

[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.960]
This is a bar.

[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.640]
When the Christmas unbox, we should stop wrote out a cruel Christmas.

[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.800]
Just leave Ann out alone.

[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.840]
Okay, she's not your type.

[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.800]
She's looking at you.

[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.200]
So you know you're not house-high.

[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.700]
You know you're not house-high.

[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.300]
I am, okay.

[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.660]
How the hell do you know?

[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.780]
There's nothing happening with you.

[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.220]
But the rent.

[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.140]
Look at you and her.

[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.920]
All right, now let's go back to what you said.

[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.640]
The what was it about discockities or what?

[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.220]
Well, they're really not fun to hang around with.

[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.660]
Oh, okay.

[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.080]
Miami.

[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.860]
Oh, is this the adolescent man?

[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.060]
W.I.O.D.

[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.460]
Yeah, mobile and fucking news.

[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.980]
Speaking.

[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.620]
New.

[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.160]
Yeah.

[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.640]
How you doing?

[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.180]
Okay.

[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.860]
I just turned you on to the water, though.

[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.480]
It's one thing.

[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.840]
Why show you on the show today?

[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.880]
Good question.

[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.340]
Can we come in and see if we can.

[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.640]
How long?

[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.940]
Can you answer for himself?

[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.380]
It's so embarrassing.

[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.080]
The guy you showed the fences.

[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.840]
We're just sitting here joking around.

[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.740]
He gets all at least that that vent out of shape of the house.

[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.480]
All the fences.

[00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.420]
All these people.

[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.820]
So let me ask you a question.

[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.140]
Sure.

[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.160]
You know who Joey is?

[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.580]
Yeah.

[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.220]
You know who Bill Marshall is.

[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.060]
Bill Marshall, no.

[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.840]
Good.

[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.720]
Okay.

[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.580]
You heard Joey show on the weekend on Saturday, 10 to 2 on 610 W.I.O.D.

[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.260]
I got better things to do.

[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.760]
Okay.

[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.200]
Excellent.

[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.360]
I'm not excellent.

[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.480]
Someone's just taking money away from the company when you do that.

[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.640]
I didn't want to discourage someone from the list.

[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.180]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.420]
He's sitting in the cash contribution.

[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.720]
And you will listen.

[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.300]
What's your sir?

[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.280]
He's got it off the air.

[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.920]
Sir?

[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.180]
Goodbye.

[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.540]
You can orchestrate now.

[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.500]
You can still make it up here.

[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.840]
You know, I mean, the station really means money now that you're ready.

[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.200]
You never told me anything during the break that you were going to tell me.

[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.600]
I forgot.

[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.080]
Remind me to tell you, those are in the next break.

[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.980]
What about how they're losing tons of money?

[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.540]
No, no, no.

[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.540]
Now, companies only work like 5 billion dollars.

[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.400]
I know we can handle it.

[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.380]
Is everybody know that this company owns entertainment tonight?

[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.140]
Yeah.

[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.720]
Television show.

[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.320]
I don't think a lot of folks know that.

[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.320]
In cost cable?

[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.720]
Yeah.

[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.540]
Lots of interest.

[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.400]
And WSV.

[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:50.960]
Yeah.

[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.660]
WSV.

[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.200]
And KF by AMFM and PM and VM.

[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.660]
Big ones.

[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.440]
How can you never make law of stainless?

[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.420]
I know it's a smog.

[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.020]
How about New York?

[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.760]
For Lauderdale.

[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.480]
Well, Neil, why do you win it?

[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.320]
How about New York?

[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.520]
I turned down WABC twice and he don't believe me.

[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.700]
I'll put you in the full with all of you.

[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.620]
I know you will not handle it because you're unemployable.

[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.580]
I mean, see, I don't come on here.

[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.340]
I say, well, I do it on a big job in New York.

[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.940]
How about why don't you get Steve's job?

[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.140]
Anybody that's reading, they want Steve out of there?

[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.380]
Now, they face 30 grand.

[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.560]
Oh, that's a point.

[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.440]
You go to QAM and say, home.

[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.040]
What is it now?

[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.420]
Neil, watch yourself at all times because I think Joey is fixated on New York.

[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.320]
I know, right?

[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.180]
I'm also homophobic.

[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.080]
Those people who think that it was cruel.

[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.920]
Why makes all those cruises to Bangkok?

[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.600]
Those people who think that it was cruel for GTR to change the on air staff overnight.

[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:50.980]
Obviously, one in New York when Joey went down with WNBC because that was like two weeks

[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.660]
worth of whining and crying and complaining about home.

[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.500]
By Joey.

[00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.120]
Oh, yeah.

[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:57.980]
What are you talking about?

[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.660]
When NBC was going off the air.

[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.620]
I wasn't even there when they were going off the air.

[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.420]
I left the air earlier.

[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.320]
I left with Supi Sales.

[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.160]
We both got fired at the same time because they didn't want to buy our contracts.

[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.100]
Well, that was a great job.

[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:15.780]
I liked it there.

[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.660]
I would say they're forever.

[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.240]
Of course.

[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.320]
They're like 50 grand.

[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:20.360]
50 grand.

[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.460]
They like you stay on it.

[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.020]
It's a 150 grand a year.

[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:23.840]
I mean, were you made?

[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:24.820]
When?

[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.140]
When I was doing that.

[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.900]
More than I made.

[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:28.800]
Yeah, where were you?

[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.120]
You were at WNWS.

[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:30.320]
Okay.

[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.260]
Having WL at home.

[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.080]
So now we're comparing showers.

[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:33.400]
Yeah.

[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.240]
You make money.

[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:34.960]
Well, come back now.

[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.240]
You make here now.

[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.260]
About 15 bucks.

[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:37.920]
Okay.

[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:38.920]
You know.

[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:39.940]
And I didn't have to have that.

[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.760]
I see how much I make which I will not just discuss that.

[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.000]
Yeah, I know what you make exactly.

[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:43.600]
Did that do?

[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.520]
Yeah, I thought you were agent.

[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.000]
How much?

[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.600]
Well, you want to give it out of the air.

[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:46.800]
No.

[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:47.520]
Give me fingers.

[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.200]
Not that one.

[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:48.760]
How much do you think?

[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:49.640]
No.

[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.280]
It's almost not even close.

[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.020]
Much more.

[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.040]
No, it ain't kept.

[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:53.260]
Yeah.

[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.560]
Let me try this.

[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.300]
You would be springy.

[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:55.580]
Try this.

[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.460]
Try this.

[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:57.460]
No.

[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:57.980]
Yeah.

[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.480]
Maybe I will have some pink laundry now.

[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.120]
Okay.

[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.500]
One forty three.

[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.160]
See, I'm not the kind of like Steve.

[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:06.600]
I don't eat.

[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.000]
I don't eat.

[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.320]
I don't eat.

[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.600]
I don't tell anybody how much I make.

[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.940]
But since you're such an expert, you think you know how much I'm angry.

[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.100]
You gave me that crap.

[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:12.940]
Well, I made 250.

[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:13.560]
You're great.

[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.540]
It's great to work with you.

[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.740]
You're more than I make.

[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.360]
Let me say this.

[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.640]
If I was in New York right now making what Steve is making, which is the same as he was

[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.480]
making here, I couldn't afford to live there.

[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.340]
Now, would you agree with that?

[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:23.720]
Yes.

[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.820]
But he does have those cards that he trades.

[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.660]
Let's go to mobile and Miami.

[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:30.460]
I know.

[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.420]
I'm better cash him in.

[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:31.700]
Yeah.

[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.440]
The baseball cards.

[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:33.900]
Steve's grave lines spy report.

[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:34.760]
Oh, great.

[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.740]
Yeah, Mr. Kickinger of the 50 bells and what?

[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.480]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.960]
Maybe I can find out why you're talking.

[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.120]
I was one of my classics.

[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.980]
Because WYNG is my favorite radio station.

[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.220]
Let's just be Dick Tracy.

[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:45.660]
Be a Dick Tracy.

[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.580]
Don't start filthy stuff on this show.

[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.660]
Okay, save it for Saturday.

[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:58.460]
Kick him ass with 50,000 watts of power all over South Florida from the keys to the Palm beaches.

[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.000]
Even out to the Bahamas.

[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.200]
This is WYNG.

[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.300]
Okay, what is it?

[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:09.280]
Well, Mr. Grayline goes around telling people that the reason you leave stations is because you are at the leave station

[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.780]
because the lawyer bills become too big.

[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:12.400]
Oh, really?

[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:13.180]
Oh, really?

[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.360]
Well, that's what happened once.

[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.460]
Yeah, once that happened.

[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.440]
And first of all, I wasn't asked to leave anywhere.

[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.020]
Oh.

[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.400]
You took a better job.

[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.280]
You have to exactly.

[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.040]
Well, when you leave somewhere, you're making double the money.

[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.060]
You're not asked to leave.

[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.820]
Okay, when people treat you like crap and they don't know what they really want, you say goodbye.

[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.720]
You find something better.

[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.500]
Yeah, well, he gave the impression that every time that you left the station,

[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.080]
it's because the law suits have been filed against the stations and it gets too expensive to keep you.

[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.460]
Yeah, well, I hate to break the news here.

[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.420]
There were only lawsuits filed against two radio stations, both by the same person that are well publicized in which we don't discuss.

[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.320]
And he knows that just as everybody else does.

[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:44.640]
That's okay.

[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.520]
Sour grapes, sour grapes from Mr. Grave Line, okay?

[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:49.060]
Okay.

[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.540]
See ya.

[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:50.980]
Talk to you later.

[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.400]
That's another one, our Dave Grave Line.

[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.340]
I got some good stories about him too for off the ear.

[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.480]
Love him 45 and W.I.O.D.

[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.080]
Yeah, kind of like Rod Roddy's stories.

[00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.740]
Uh, coconut grove.

[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:00.660]
Hi, Neil.

[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.040]
Hi.

[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.700]
Richie Swimwear calling you.

[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.100]
Who?

[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.220]
Richie Swimwear.

[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.220]
Richie Swimwear.

[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.280]
Well, it's an addict's setting.

[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.980]
Boy, they're still out there, even though we no longer have all those exciting people are doing new shows in the afternoon.

[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.660]
Oh, but we want to do one with you.

[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.380]
Yeah, sure.

[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:13.980]
Good luck to you.

[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.080]
Why don't you come down to coconut grove sometimes?

[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.280]
Do you remote over here?

[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.440]
Do you do a remote in the grill?

[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:19.240]
Sure.

[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.580]
Yeah, I already did one.

[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.360]
You got one with you.

[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.040]
You want some art's door?

[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:22.600]
Hmm.

[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.700]
You got one of those crotchless swimsuits for him?

[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.040]
We have everything.

[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.440]
Anything and everything we have in here.

[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.400]
Look at me, it doesn't come up with this material on Saturday.

[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.200]
That's a question.

[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:32.980]
Neil, you know what?

[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.900]
Just a couple of minutes ago, I just had a flash as you were answering that guy's question about your lawsuits and everything.

[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.640]
And I was realizing that's the most sincere part about you.

[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.060]
Is that's right.

[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.980]
I mean, what is your still with the truth on the air for once?

[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.940]
Neil, we have a special one for you.

[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.460]
What is it?

[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.300]
We have a special swimsuit designed for you.

[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:52.660]
What is it?

[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:52.660]

[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:52.660]

[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.800]
You have to come down here.

[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.360]
There's no bottom.

[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:55.780]
Yes, right on.

[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:56.420]
Okay.

[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.500]
How we want you to get a job here, Richie?

[00:11:59.200 --> 00:11:59.400]
Yeah.

[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.140]
It would really boost our business.

[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.040]
How about you?

[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.720]
You'd be a great asset.

[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.020]
Marvel's been running some races over here.

[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:04.940]
You've got a lot of spirit time.

[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.680]
He's into modeling.

[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.200]
Oh, that's great.

[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:08.920]
Bring him all down.

[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.380]
Okay.

[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.740]
Take care of yourself.

[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.760]
John, I go out of your out of food.

[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.440]
We never hand in any food.

[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:13.980]
I know.

[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:14.560]
This is great.

[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.600]
Hey, we're not going to feed you.

[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.000]
Don't keep sucking around my sponsors for free food.

[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:18.720]
Don't get your own.

[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.640]
Bring some money into the station.

[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.800]
Johnny Dark left it about 10 minutes in here now.

[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:23.440]
Where do you eat?

[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.640]
No, back in plantation.

[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:25.380]
Where do you eat?

[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.980]
Well, it's in places you go.

[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.060]
I just follow wherever you go.

[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.940]
I go because I want to look like you on a beat like you.

[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:30.540]
I want to beat you.

[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.420]
I want to have your job.

[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.200]
I want to have your money.

[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.300]
And the best thing I could do, I've ordered a satellite dish because of this.

[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.060]
You know, I want you where.

[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.440]
You went, I do the same things.

[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.980]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:09.820]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:09.820]

[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:09.820]

[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:09.820]

[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:09.820]

[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:09.820]

[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:09.840]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:09.840]

[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.000]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.340]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:10.340]

[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.040]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.780]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.460]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.060]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.440]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.080]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.960]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.420]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:42.060]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.140]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:43.220]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:43.220]

[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:43.220]

[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:43.220]

[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:43.380]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.060]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:44.920]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.540]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:45.600]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:45.760]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:45.760]

[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.940]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.240]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:50.960]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.940]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.160]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.280]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:01.400]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.600]
There's one thing I said at all.

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.600]

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.600]

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.600]

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.600]

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.600]

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.600]

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.600]

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.600]

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.600]

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.600]

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.600]

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.600]

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.600]

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.600]

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.940]
There's one thing I said at all.

[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:26.940]

[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.360]
There's one thing I said at all.

[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.040]
There's one thing I said at all.

[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.380]
There's one thing I said at all.

[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:48.920]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:49.240]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:49.240]

[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:49.260]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:49.260]

[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:49.280]

[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:49.280]

[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:49.280]

[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:49.280]

[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:49.280]

[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:49.300]

[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:49.460]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:49.780]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.960]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.760]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.240]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.800]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.140]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.700]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.360]
I'm not going to be a cop.

[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.920]
Oh, not again.

[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:03.880]
Oh, man.

[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.120]
Now I smell like a French swat too.

[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.600]
God, it is so good.

[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:08.720]
Why do you do that?

[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.500]
It's great stuff.

[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.620]
What do you take a bath in it?

[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.840]
This is O.D. plantation.

[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:12.780]
O.D.?

[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:13.060]
Wonderful.

[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:13.420]
Yeah.

[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.820]
Yeah, I owe everybody a lot of money.

[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.520]
O.D. my dog, man.

[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.620]
It smells like my backyard.

[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:18.580]
Grotesque.

[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.160]
Then he rolls around in the yard.

[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:20.860]
W.I.O.D.

[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:21.740]
And Neil.

[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:22.160]
Yeah.

[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:22.660]
How you doing?

[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:23.180]
Great.

[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.720]
OK, I think it's your...

[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.020]
You say, sir, yes or no?

[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:26.800]
About what?

[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.420]
I don't know.

[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.300]
I think it's yours pretty good.

[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:29.920]
OK.

[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.960]
But you're number one, though.

[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:31.700]
Number one.

[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:32.480]
Number two.

[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.280]
I'm number two, yeah.

[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:33.580]
I know.

[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.780]
I know what number two is, too.

[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.720]
And the Marshall's number...

[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.580]
Seven count that high.

[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:38.940]
Goodbye.

[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:39.500]
OK.

[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.380]
Good call.

[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.140]
We need food.

[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.840]
The white hot's here, you got?

[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:43.480]
Yeah.

[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.340]
We got the food around here.

[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.200]
This man is not even, OK?

[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.580]
You are disgusting.

[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.380]
You really are.

[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.260]
You are Grotesque.

[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.900]
Him, I don't mind, because these guys are not fat, but you're a fat slum.

[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.740]
You ran here to tell me about how you run that crack diet.

[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:55.640]
You're losing all that weight.

[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.180]
He was on board.

[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.080]
I'm six degrees.

[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:57.640]
I'm six degrees.

[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:57.700]
I was about to hit that.

[00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:58.440]
What was the thing?

[00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:58.940]
He was falling.

[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.060]
I'm fast and he always spayed away.

[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.860]
And the food comes in and he actually is sucking around.

[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.020]
That food wasn't in here.

[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:04.800]
I'm not exaggerating.

[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.820]
30 seconds.

[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.140]
He was at that door.

[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.320]
Super Dave called me and told me to his food.

[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.260]
Utah's super Dave's a bug off.

[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.620]
Get him together with Dave from Kendall.

[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.800]
Maybe they can do things together.

[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.080]
What kind of guy is off the air?

[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.120]
Oh, it is?

[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:16.440]
Yeah.

[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:16.820]
They're dark.

[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:17.680]
Oh, thanks a lot.

[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.840]
There's a guy coming in telling stories.

[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.300]
What WGUY, I said, you ought to be at that station.

[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:23.960]
That's important to me.

[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.140]
And he said they're off the air.

[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.240]
This is a great news break.

[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.600]
Thanks for watching W.G.Y. and Sconnected. You could do why.

[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.900]
D.Y. You can do good there and Sconnected. It's right up your alley.

[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.760]
Neil, try something. I'm good right here. I'm Tariya.

[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.720]
I'm Tariya. Yes, I am. You're dying over here.

[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.260]
I am dying over here.

[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.960]
All right, let's talk about Tariya out of Hollywood.

[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.400]
Can't wait if you want to go over and buy a fake.

[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.640]
Okay, so what are they going to do with 5 o'clock in Tariya?

[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.140]
Oh, why do you, is he? You care about Tariya?

[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.400]
I was going to satellite all the way up.

[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.540]
I'm on my five years ago.

[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.100]
Asian days ago? They signed off.

[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.020]
Yeah, you always said, well, I've ever been to a purple people leader on AM.

[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.380]
It was a shabble. You know, I mean, who the hell wants your music?

[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.900]
I am any more. People bring you gossip like balls of fruit for Buddha.

[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:07.520]
You know, I was going to Disney World at the end of the summer.

[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.540]
And it was a Mickey Mouse trip.

[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:09.560]
Yeah, a Miami.

[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.280]
It's about time, Neil.

[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.420]
Yeah, I know. What do you want?

[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.300]
Well, I got a guest here. You don't want us to step on your time, do you?

[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.940]
Yeah, but he's too ponderous.

[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.580]
I know. Well, what do you wonder is, let's see,

[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.280]
let's see what he's got. What do you got?

[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.520]
Let's see it. Let's hear it.

[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.340]
Oh, okay. Come on. Let's go.

[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:28.700]
Okay.

[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.100]
I'm putting it away.

[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:32.580]
We're in place.

[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.020]
This man is sick. He really is.

[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.520]
Go ahead, sir. We're listening.

[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.140]
You said, see, hey, look at that.

[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.580]
Is that definitive? Is that this town?

[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.940]
The guy who doesn't even have a job out of material.

[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.520]
They wouldn't be like that in Cheek to Waga.

[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.500]
I'll tell you that right now.

[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.260]
That's the bully guy.

[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.620]
You remember, I don't want to get up in New York issue.

[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.920]
But do you remember a restaurant called the Mon...

[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.580]
Was it the Monokai or the Monolo?

[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.220]
It was in Cheek to Waga on Route 5.

[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.240]
Yeah, that was the...

[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.400]
Oh, that was the best.

[00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.560]
That was the best.

[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.780]
We used to go there and pick out on the way to the old

[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.060]
when the bills were in the American football area.

[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.520]
Go there and have lunch.

[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.340]
And then after the game, come back and have dinner

[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.140]
in about 40 of those crudey drinks, you know?

[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.060]
Yeah, well, that's a load of that.

[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.020]
I never even tasted the food. Great place.

[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.200]
Long gone history.

[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.380]
In Cheek to Waga, one of my favorite places.

[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.220]
W.I.O. Dean.

[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.460]
Yeah, like the victim here.

[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:18.780]
Sure.

[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.400]
Okay, let's take...

[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:20.960]
Are we getting food?

[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:21.700]
Do you want food?

[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:22.880]
Yeah, I would like to order.

[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.000]
It's lunch time for me.

[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.040]
I know you're only...

[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.100]
Oh, there's different ramen, right?

[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:26.460]
What do you have?

[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.480]
I want the audience to decide if they're going to leave

[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.800]
because a lot of them are waiting to see if you'll leave.

[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.120]
Who can we get?

[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.680]
Well, I'll be Marvin and Sarah's banana.

[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.540]
Hi W.I.D. and you are Roger, so...

[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.000]
Coral Springs.

[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.140]
Why not all of bring some stuff in for Joey, right?

[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.420]
Yeah, he should.

[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:42.960]
Okay.

[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.700]
And the matter of fact, Joey gave me and my three buddies,

[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.380]
Neely Burgers, after Bill Marshall called us up

[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.660]
and invited us on a show.

[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:50.300]
He did not.

[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.600]
And we show up, drove all the way from Lakeland.

[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.660]
We show up and they go,

[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.140]
oh, we don't know what you're talking about, but...

[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.700]
Yeah, but he wants you to bring the bird from Lakeland.

[00:18:58.940 --> 00:18:59.820]
Yeah, I don't like that.

[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:00.960]
We like the Neely Burgers.

[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:01.360]
Oh, it is.

[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.680]
Joey's getting off of the other side of the market.

[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.240]
And their kids are in the blocker on TV now.

[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.360]
And Joey can't control himself.

[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.100]
Will you stop it?

[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:06.720]
I love Joe.

[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:07.480]
I think he's great.

[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.140]
Great group.

[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:09.080]
Joe, yeah.

[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:09.860]
He's in the group.

[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:10.820]
New kids on the block.

[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.740]
Sure, are you gone?

[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:13.620]
No, I'm here.

[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.120]
Oh, okay.

[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.760]
That's not Joey's name is, what is it?

[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:17.240]
Don't worry.

[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.040]
That's Joey.

[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:18.960]
That one's Donnie.

[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:19.320]
Jordan.

[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.400]
It's not Donnie.

[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:20.980]
That's Jordan.

[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.460]
You don't know Donnie from Maria.

[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.580]
Look at my acne here.

[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.180]
You see it telling him.

[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.960]
She's one big sit on top of his head.

[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.520]
I have one question for Joey.

[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.220]
What's going on in there?

[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.400]
Joey's taking over her slot on Sunday too.

[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.820]
Neil, yes.

[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:33.960]
I got a question for Joey.

[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:34.440]
Yeah.

[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.680]
I know we needed an audience on a TV show.

[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.260]
But does the neat cardboard cut out for a radio show?

[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.680]
That TV show needed a host, yeah.

[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.740]
We had another guy who used to have cardboard cut out

[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.860]
for his audience too, sir.

[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:46.680]
You know what happened to him?

[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.000]
No.

[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:51.560]
The world will the same young that part came from.

[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.060]
Is that Neil?

[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:52.720]
Yeah.

[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:53.480]
Who?

[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.180]
I guess it's Alex Bennett.

[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:55.700]
No.

[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:56.200]
Yeah.

[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.160]
Larry Brent looked.

[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.240]
We don't talk about him though.

[00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.020]
No, we can't miss him.

[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.220]
Alex spent his name on a ear.

[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.380]
How about Larry Boyd?

[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.480]
That might bring him the other room.

[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.040]
Whatever happened to Eric Lambert now.

[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:04.700]
History.

[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:05.360]
History.

[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.760]
I find it be courted in some little thing

[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.040]
that he plays on stage and he's all excited about.

[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.860]
He plays out of our lives forever.

[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:11.880]
We did that too.

[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.420]
Good.

[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.080]
You got a fan of Death Gossars?

[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:14.840]
Yeah, Death's pretty good.

[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.980]
So what do you want to, you almost as good as the last guy?

[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.060]
Well, I don't, you know, I was just wondering why

[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.640]
Bill Marshall called me up and flighted my friends

[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.640]
to the radio show.

[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.000]
And we showed up and they said,

[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.100]
we don't know what you're talking about.

[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.320]
Here's Neil and Berger get out of here.

[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.960]
Well, maybe it's for me.

[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.840]
At least they gave you something anyway, right?

[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:31.260]
Yeah.

[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:31.760]
Yeah.

[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:32.500]
OK.

[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.060]
All right.

[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.200]
I'm dying on the ass.

[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.180]
Well, that's going to do it for this exciting hour

[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.800]
of the Joy Reynolds go.

[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.920]
Or Pongress.

[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.540]
Yeah, it is.

[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:41.320]
It's really fond of us.

[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.360]
We had a pretty good show going to all WYOD.

[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:44.940]
Speak Neil.

[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:45.680]
What?

[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:46.640]
I'd like to speak to Neil.

[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.060]
Sure.

[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:47.400]
Who's this?

[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.340]
This is Mark.

[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.440]
Mark in the dark.

[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.440]
Mark in the dark.

[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:50.960]
Is that Neil?

[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:51.720]
Hold on, Mark.

[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:52.880]
Are you going to hold on?

[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:53.340]
OK.

[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.500]
You're not going to abandon this, right?

[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:55.900]
Uh, is he still there?

[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:56.260]
Yeah.

[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.560]
You might then.

[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.300]
All right.

[00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:58.580]
Hold on.

[00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:59.480]
Hold on.

[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.060]
Don't do it.

[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:00.440]
He's OK.

[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:00.920]
He's not bad.

[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:01.680]
He's just old.

[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.540]
OK, we got the news coming up with Gail not so bright

[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:05.980]
and Neil and then we'll come back in 12-0.

[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.180]
Father, guys, I'm sitting around here.

[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.240]
What's the bright story?

[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.200]
Is it you're not going to believe?

[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.500]
And maybe it behind door number one,

[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.820]
you might find Rod Roddy's suit.

[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.280]
Yeah, I am old and stupid, you're right.

[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.480]
You probably put that on carton way that next week.

[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.580]
Hey, yeah, mark that out of the tape.

[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.240]
And we'll be going for a call, Harvick.

[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.300]
Rick and Ponson to the Sanford Room.

[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:34.260]
It's the Andy Griffith Show, starring Andy Griffith as Sheriff

[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.100]
Andy J.L.E.

[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.100]
Bradges Vajeras and V.

[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:41.780]
Don Nott as Bunny and Clint Eastwood, Agobie.

[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.420]
Well, could you tell your father what happened to you today?

[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.060]
Hell no.

[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.420]
I had a call from the principal this afternoon.

[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.180]
The principal?

[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.480]
Ah, he be.

[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.560]
You're not only old and wrinkled.

[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.140]
You have big mouth, too.

[00:21:58.940 --> 00:21:59.960]
What is that mean?

[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.520]
Who is coming up to bright?

[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.080]
What is?

[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.800]
During lunch period, your son, Hancock,

[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.320]
raw fake it to the flagpole.

[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.540]
Who did what?

[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.260]
But, Boah, he was being an ass.

[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.500]
So, what?

[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.300]
No, man, what kind of language is that?

[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.460]
Uh, with English, yeah.

[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.080]
I wouldn't be in this trouble now if Bunny hadn't given me

[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.060]
those hand-tuffs.

[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.140]
Don't go to hell.

[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.160]
I told you not to use them on real people.

[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.200]
Borye, I'm surprised with you.

[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.020]
You too.

[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:30.980]
Wait a minute.

[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.580]
I play like a good law man and you say you're surprised.

[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.320]
I say you should be proud.

[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.840]
Right, Boah.

[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.620]
Um, proud, proud, proud, proud, proud, proud, proud, proud.

[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.440]
I'm dying on the hands.

[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.560]
Okay, 12 or 7.

[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.340]
I was when coming, do you know, did he call?

[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.320]
Did we call him?

[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.640]
We did.

[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.400]
Well, then how do you know if he's not coming?

[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.100]
Or he is coming?

[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.400]
You're going to call him.

[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.080]
Someday.

[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.820]
Someday, okay, 12 or 7, I think I said that Joey's

[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:05.780]
wandering around the building again.

[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.720]
So, we might have a chance to have a fun here for a second.

[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.860]
And, uh, Coral Springs.

[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:10.620]
Yeah, now.

[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:11.500]
I'll wait a minute.

[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:12.760]
Are you still here?

[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:13.440]
I'm here.

[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:13.900]
Okay.

[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:14.720]
Okay.

[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:15.720]
Yeah.

[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:16.320]

[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.520]
Are those two four left of the word, Mr. Lewis?

[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:19.840]
John Bill.

[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.200]
Joey in Bill, yeah.

[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:21.940]
Get that.

[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:22.580]
Absolutely.

[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.340]
But you like their show?

[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:24.800]
No.

[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:25.540]
Okay.

[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:26.620]
Well, we're hungry.

[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.680]
One doesn't know what he's doing and the other one

[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.620]
doesn't know where he is.

[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:30.640]
And I don't care.

[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.180]
I so it's a perfect man.

[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.060]
Yeah, absolutely.

[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.460]
So you want to have a look at that?

[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:34.840]
Huh?

[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.160]
Anything else?

[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.200]
No, that's about it.

[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:39.580]
Okay.

[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.260]
Good call.

[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:40.820]
Good job.

[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.240]
Okay, we have an open line in Broward,

[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.280]
524WYOD, Boca.

[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:48.860]
Hold on, Lee.

[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:50.440]
Why don't you call Lee?

[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.300]
He might put you to work.

[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.900]
W-I-O-D.

[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.120]
Good one.

[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.140]
And Palm Beach is open to 655 fouls,

[00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:58.420]
655WYOD.

[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.640]
Okay, now any other rumors you want to start?

[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.580]
I'm going to get rid of the radio career.

[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.760]
I think I'm going to print it.

[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:05.980]
7WYOD.

[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.440]
Okay, let's go to Miramar,

[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.160]
you know, like they bury Miramar.

[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.640]
I see myself.

[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:15.440]
Myself.

[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.800]
Okay, let's go to Broward.

[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.620]
Yeah, I'm a touch mill.

[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:20.360]
Sure, hold on.

[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.280]
And Palm Beach.

[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:22.940]
Hello.

[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:23.520]
Hello.

[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.100]
Hold on.

[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.140]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:26.460]
Damn it.

[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:27.020]
Yes.

[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:27.760]
Yeah.

[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.660]
What are we?

[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.400]
Please, please get off the show.

[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.740]
Okay, he's leaving right after food comes.

[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:33.440]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.340]
I-O-D.

[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:36.020]
Hi.

[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:36.460]
Yeah.

[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:37.760]
Some rise.

[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:38.800]
Some rise.

[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:39.720]
Love you.

[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:40.700]
Okay, hold on.

[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:41.760]
Yeah, you're holding?

[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:42.640]
Yes, I'll hold it.

[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.020]
Okay, and how about you, sir?

[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:45.540]
Sir?

[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.220]
Man?

[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:48.660]
It.

[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:49.620]
You put it down.

[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:50.740]
Palm Beach.

[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.040]
Special request.

[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.260]
Please get that ass off.

[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.300]
Putting it here?

[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.080]
No, he's here, it's up to you.

[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:57.960]
Again, are you serious?

[00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:58.680]
Yeah, cut it out.

[00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.980]
He's very emotional and sensitive.

[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.040]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:01.560]
Hey, Neil.

[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:01.920]
Yeah.

[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.380]
How you doing?

[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:02.800]
Great.

[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:03.780]
Hey, let me ask you something.

[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.600]
When's your going to be on that?

[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.060]
If it's like a beyond study, 10 to 2.

[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.340]
You know, when Meg Green is on

[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.620]
and the plant lady and the plant guy?

[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.140]
Oh, it was a good prime time spot.

[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.560]
No, it's good to be on that day.

[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.420]
For another week or two.

[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.620]
Oh, that's good.

[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.580]
All right, something, you know.

[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.260]
Take care, guys.

[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:17.820]
Okay.

[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:18.120]
Bye.

[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:18.740]
Good job.

[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:19.840]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:20.300]
No, this one.

[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.340]
They paid me a front over it.

[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:21.640]
Okay.

[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.620]
North Miami.

[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.340]
What for a year?

[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:25.360]
Hey, guys.

[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:25.780]
Yeah.

[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:26.740]
Uh, Neil.

[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:27.540]
Yes, sir.

[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.020]
Yeah, you used to say that you listen to Joey

[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:30.880]
when you were a kid.

[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:31.420]
Charles.

[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.240]
How is that possible?

[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:34.720]
How is it possible?

[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.820]
Well, I turned the radio on 1520 WKVW Buffalo.

[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.880]
I used to come blaring in, 50,000 watts.

[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:41.420]
Big time.

[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.740]
Well, I can't wait for you then.

[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:43.220]
Six.

[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.280]
That's when he stole my act.

[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:45.720]
Yeah.

[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.000]
When he used to say douchebag?

[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.600]
The Joey must be like 65 then, right?

[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:50.900]
Easy.

[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:51.900]
Easy.

[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:52.420]
Stop it.

[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.820]
Everybody's seen my face on television.

[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.640]
You can't get away with that fraud.

[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.380]
They know I look 70.

[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:57.880]
Yeah.

[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.940]
Looks like hand vision's brother and mom.

[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:01.260]
Okay, Pat.

[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:01.700]
Very.

[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.460]
So, wait.

[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:03.020]
What was it?

[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.140]
What?

[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:04.760]
Hey.

[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:05.160]
What?

[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.040]
Hey, yeah.

[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.460]
Joey, you're in there kissing Neil.

[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.320]
Yeah, I know.

[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.040]
Gilbert's the only one who's missing.

[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.200]
I've got to count them.

[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.100]
It's the show of the 90s.

[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:13.740]
Okay.

[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:14.880]
Here we know the game 90s.

[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.220]
We have an open line in day 751 WYOD

[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:21.180]
and Palm Beach 655 TROAT 655 WYOD.

[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:21.660]
Hello.

[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:22.320]
Neil.

[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:22.740]
Yeah.

[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:23.600]
I want to ask you a question.

[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.060]
Is it true?

[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:24.460]
Wait, wait a minute.

[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.480]
Can I ask you a question?

[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:25.840]
Oh.

[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:26.460]
Why is this then?

[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.680]
Everybody I punch up today,

[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:28.940]
all of a sudden out of nowhere,

[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.220]
wants to ask a question.

[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.840]
Have you noticed that?

[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.620]
I can't have a demo.

[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:33.260]
It's like a disease.

[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.520]
Well, let me ask you.

[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.460]
Well, hold on a second.

[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.180]
We'll think about it.

[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:36.800]
WYOD.

[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:38.700]
Damn it.

[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.280]
Uh, yes.

[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:39.900]
What's the question?

[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.140]
Yeah, is it true that Joey had 70 series?

[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.140]
No bragging about that.

[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.420]
It was all over the world.

[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.640]
It was the only station in the market.

[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.180]
It was not.

[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.200]
There were 23 stations.

[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.220]
You couldn't hear any other station at night.

[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:51.900]
Wait a minute.

[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:52.340]
I have.

[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.540]
When I was on the air in Buffalo,

[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.940]
I had a felony caravan in Washington, DC,

[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.160]
Baltimore, Maryland, Montreal, Canada.

[00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.260]
What are you talking about?

[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.040]
You're going to have a 70-year-old.

[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.360]
Yeah, I did, sir.

[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:03.540]
Thank you very much.

[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.540]
Paulie, who'd do it back.

[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:05.580]
Would you like to give me another,

[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.840]
another, another stripe for being the, uh,

[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:09.600]
Joey Reynolds?

[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.540]
Why isn't anybody, why don't you,

[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.180]
why don't I, why don't you,

[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.280]
I'm going to be a compliment?

[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.860]
Next to George Lorenz.

[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:16.700]
Pause for that one.

[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:17.880]
You won't even listen.

[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:18.700]
I'm listening.

[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.380]
Like just like the rest.

[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:20.980]
This is hard.

[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:21.720]
I'm listening to you.

[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.720]
These Italians are so goddamn emotional.

[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.580]
Next to George Lorenz,

[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.720]
if you kiss me again.

[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.900]
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:29.000]
I'm not, I'm not.

[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.420]
Get away.

[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:31.960]
Cheese.

[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:33.900]
We are emotional.

[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.960]
Kiss my other cheek is gone.

[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:38.540]
On the other side.

[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.500]
No, I'm not finished.

[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.760]
I'm not finished saying what I'm

[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.300]
next to George Lorenz,

[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.660]
the hound dog, he died.

[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.220]
And Dick Beyondy,

[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:47.680]
he died too.

[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.620]
This, he did not only on the air.

[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.180]
This man was the greatest legend in Buffalo,

[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.320]
rock and roll history.

[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.120]
Next to those two.

[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.360]
Yeah, well.

[00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:58.580]
Am I right?

[00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.400]
Would that be a,

[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.900]
you got, that's a good company.

[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:01.660]
Pretty good start.

[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:02.120]
Yeah.

[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.840]
Now his problem was he never got lost

[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.640]
in a taxi cab like Dick Beyondy.

[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.220]
And he didn't know how to make a stick out of it, okay?

[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.360]
Well, you sure know how you was hamburger

[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:11.840]
out there.

[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:12.500]
I mean, look at you.

[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:12.920]
Exactly.

[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.180]
I make something out of nothing.

[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.240]
There's a way to learn how to do that.

[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:15.900]
You might have a show.

[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.260]
I might have a life.

[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.040]
So what are you saying, sir?

[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.000]
What is the bottom line?

[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.340]
May?

[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:20.800]
Yeah.

[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:21.720]
I love you now.

[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.160]
Okay.

[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.440]
I'm dying on the air.

[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.460]
That's what they all say.

[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.340]
They're only one of the kisses.

[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.400]
Joey, that's a problem.

[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:27.100]
Okay.

[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.060]
A W-I-O-D.

[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:28.980]
Yeah.

[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:29.740]
Hold it.

[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.020]
And the problem with people like Joey is that

[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:32.960]
and I mentioned this the other,

[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.200]
a couple of weeks ago,

[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.980]
I wasn't thinking about him specifically,

[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.660]
but now that I can sniff my finger,

[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.600]
this, this man,

[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.680]
where so much colon that when you get near him,

[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.680]
you didn't even have to touch him.

[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.600]
You can't, you can't even wash it off of

[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.000]
comment or Ajax or Corox.

[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:47.960]
That's not the long.

[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:48.820]
That's my body.

[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:49.700]
You have to like,

[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.060]
you wash it for months.

[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.140]
I'm secreting.

[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:52.680]
Yeah.

[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.460]
Go to Thailand and secreting.

[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:55.320]
Okay.

[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.320]
Wayne Arnold is on the way.

[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:56.920]
Happy now.

[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.620]
Tree breaks this arm by the way.

[00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.320]
When is on the way?

[00:28:59.440 --> 00:28:59.640]
With where?

[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.200]
Yeah, right.

[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:00.520]
With where?

[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:01.280]
With where?

[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:01.280]

[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.380]
Now I have a tip for both of you guys.

[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.420]
Because I'm experienced at this.

[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.720]
When Fatso over here next door,

[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:07.900]
the coast is with the most.

[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.340]
When he comes waddling through there,

[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.060]
just hide it under the table.

[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:12.940]
Is this Danny Dark?

[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.300]
We're talking about Danny Dark.

[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.440]
Johnny Dark, whatever is one.

[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.840]
Whatever is Dark over there.

[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.460]
Johnny Nebworth.

[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:18.060]
Miami.

[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:19.140]
Hello.

[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:19.760]
Yes sir.

[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.480]
Can I ask you a question?

[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:21.860]
It's West the most Syracuse.

[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:22.640]
How are you doing Russ?

[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:23.480]
How are you doing?

[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:25.020]
WSYR Syracuse.

[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.220]
Can I ask Joey Pushton?

[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.040]
Bill O'Donnell.

[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:27.620]
He's dead now.

[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.400]
And they know Bill O'Donnell.

[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.300]
He's a very famous forest over now.

[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.000]
So making a lot of money.

[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.040]
Bill O'Donnell?

[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:32.800]
He's dead.

[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.160]
From Syracuse?

[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.060]
He's to the ball games.

[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.260]
He's dead for years.

[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.900]
He used to do the Euro games with Chuck Thompson.

[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.260]
Oh, they bury him with a mic and a dick.

[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.180]
Oh, get out of here.

[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:41.780]
So ahead.

[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.180]
What's their question sir?

[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.900]
That's Joey's question actually.

[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:45.640]
What is it?

[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.300]
Does it hit running around in the cockpit?

[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.240]
The clown officers?

[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.220]
Yeah, over my eye.

[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:50.760]
Shooting the women.

[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:51.440]
Shooting women.

[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:51.780]
Oh yeah.

[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.280]
Well, that's a good, that's a good promise.

[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.360]
Sir, you must have a good mother to mind.

[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:54.920]
Thanks for calling.

[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:55.300]
I do.

[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:56.120]
I do.

[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.020]
Oh, one more thing.

[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.040]
Yeah, the clown sucks.

[00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:58.660]
OK.

[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.220]
Well, tell us something we don't know.

[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:00.820]
12, 14.

[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.640]
See another Metz fan.

[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.900]
All those New Yorkers, you're all the same.

[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.300]
Why did you want to work at WNBC?

[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.140]
They're all those New York obnoxious pushy-lod

[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:06.940]
and a lot of money.

[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:07.900]
WYOD.

[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.580]
Yeah, can you tell me your number to add golf classic to the dial?

[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:12.860]
What?

[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.040]
Golf classic.

[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.160]
They're golf classic.

[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.220]
Can you give you a number for a golf classic?

[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:17.840]
Yeah.

[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:18.980]
Have you got it, Melvin?

[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.640]
What an ordinary does.

[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:21.680]
Oh, we don't know.

[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:22.380]
Who's that?

[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.040]
You're son and a warrant.

[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.740]
Oh, and you got it?

[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.460]
Oh, you're listening to an IQ hold on a second, Melvin

[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:29.840]
to give it to you.

[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.940]
Don't ever call me on ear about that kind of cramp again.

[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:32.860]
A mobile.

[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:34.640]
Gone.

[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.340]
See, we had a very important mobile.

[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.620]
And look who else just came in early just

[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.680]
because you guys are here and you heard that rumor too

[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.060]
about the Orlando.

[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.600]
Let's go to Deerfield.

[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.720]
How you doing, Melvin?

[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.060]
OK.

[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.820]
I wonder if you could play that you have

[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:48.920]
Blue Hair Cloth and Maricopter.

[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:49.360]
Or do that.

[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.160]
Oh, I promised that woman I was going to play

[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.000]
the Barbara Bush thing.

[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.140]
She's not even listening anymore.

[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:53.740]
I'll play it tomorrow.

[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:54.520]
Play the Burp thing.

[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:55.260]
Burp thing, son.

[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.280]
What do you want to hear?

[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:56.760]
What is it?

[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.000]
Blue Hair Cloth and Maricopter.

[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.180]
Blue Hair across America tour?

[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.260]
Didn't that the name of it?

[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.880]
What the hell is that?

[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.580]
Oh, that's that you're talking about old parts in the condo.

[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.140]
Yeah, that's perfect for Joey.

[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.780]
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.240]
He'd be great at win more, wouldn't he?

[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.940]
Man, you could make a comeback.

[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:14.900]
A comeback queen.

[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:15.480]

[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:16.640]
They're a friendship.

[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.080]
Yeah, I mean, I need to get a bed.

[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.840]
Yeah, all he wants to talk about is training

[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.460]
I fronted you.

[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.320]
That didn't form a cheat.

[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.480]
I've got him a one five.

[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.260]
It's into machines, sir.

[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.420]
I remember that.

[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:25.880]
They're a super sponsor.

[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:26.700]
WI-O-D.

[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:28.320]
Hello.

[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.140]
Hello.

[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:29.600]
Yeah.

[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:30.860]
Is this WI-O-D?

[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:31.520]
Yes, sir.

[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.180]
Oh, I'd like to see Kenyle, please.

[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:33.640]
Sure, hold on.

[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:33.880]
OK.

[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:34.800]
You're holding it?

[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:35.060]
Yeah.

[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:35.440]
OK.

[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:36.480]
WI-O-D.

[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:37.100]
Hello.

[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.020]
Can you take a light to Neil from Mr. Radio?

[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:40.900]
From Mr. Radio?

[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:41.420]
Yes.

[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.060]
What is he, some kind of a Joker operating?

[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.200]
No, no, it's me, Neil.

[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:45.280]
It's you.

[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.200]
Who?

[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:47.100]
Neil.

[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.120]
Mr. Radio.

[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.960]
Mr. Radio, where's he coming from, operating?

[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:51.800]
They're on a beach.

[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.300]
You're showing that.

[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.580]
Oh, we'll put him right on.

[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:54.360]
OK.

[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.060]
Thank you, operator.

[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:55.920]
OK, so he is.

[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.100]
Greetings, Mr. Radio.

[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:57.860]
It's Mr. Radio.

[00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:58.740]
What rumors have you got?

[00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.560]
You got a job for Joey?

[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.460]
Is it working at toast?

[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:02.300]
Yeah.

[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.160]
Oh, no, that's a Johnny Darts.

[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:04.880]
Same difference.

[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.880]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:07.700]
Yes.

[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.680]
Lots of things to ban you.

[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.200]
I've got you, uh, by the short hairs on that one, didn't we, sir?

[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:12.600]
Yes.

[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.540]
Lots of things to ban you with you, Mr. Radio.

[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:14.780]
All right.

[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:15.600]
Now, this is the call.

[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.180]
Do you know who this guy is, Mr. Radio?

[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.940]
Yeah, a guy puts out a sheet and you bet.

[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:19.860]
Oh, it's Joey.

[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.660]
Joey Reynolds is here.

[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.880]
That's why you can't hear us.

[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.560]
He once worked at WKBW when they had ratings.

[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:26.200]
That's right.

[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.760]
And WNBC when they didn't.

[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.640]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.660]
No, we had ratings at NBC.

[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.620]
NWCOP, NWOFF, NWCKY, NWCOP.

[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.940]
He worked at the POP with Rusty Podge.

[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.340]
He used to work at WSAY and Marchist around a week ago.

[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.060]
And this is Mr. Radio who knows everything.

[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:41.520]
Yes.

[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.160]
How come you're being surprised by all this?

[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:43.380]
Yes.

[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.580]
If you're such an expert, how come you don't know all the 28 stations you got fired on?

[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.820]
And I was at POPF.

[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:49.580]
Or Rusty Podge.

[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:50.640]
He's just for the record.

[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.180]
Only Art Volvo knows everything about, yeah.

[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.340]
And Volvo is Mr. Radio.

[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.140]
He's a radio-spread.

[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.860]
He's the guy who videotapes the radio station.

[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.080]
This job is while they're on the air and then sells them to little boys.

[00:32:59.360 --> 00:32:59.480]
Yes.

[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.680]
Can we talk about Super-Dale?

[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.400]
No, that's the guy on the prices right.

[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:02.880]
What is it?

[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.340]
Can we talk about Super-Dale?

[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:04.840]
Sure.

[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.900]
Have you ever seen one TV on off-site?

[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.920]
Have you seen Super-Dale?

[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:11.840]
On off-sides?

[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.720]
Yes, it's a cable show on the nose.

[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:14.840]
I don't want to see a little load.

[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.580]
Oh my gosh.

[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:17.400]
What a yenta.

[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:18.440]
Yeah.

[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.740]
Well, let's not give them any publicity.

[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:20.660]
Let's stick with us.

[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.820]
Okay, we have two very important celebrities in the building.

[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:23.240]
Right.

[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.660]
You and Joey and Gil Marshall.

[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:26.540]
Who?

[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.540]
What do you want?

[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:29.520]
Let's get to it.

[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:29.900]
You're getting ponderous.

[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:31.980]
Let's get to the point.

[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:32.760]
Can I take a call?

[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:34.040]
I'm a hurry.

[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:36.880]
To call in and take the call?

[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.300]
What a great format.

[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.200]
Wait a minute.

[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.700]
Is this Mr. Radio or is this the flower man?

[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:42.900]
No, it's Mr. Radio.

[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.260]
And you want to take a call?

[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.540]
Yeah, I want to be a talk show.

[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.400]
I was, let me practice.

[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.220]
It sounds like Roger Marx.

[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.600]
On the next Steve Dole.

[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:51.580]
You're a what?

[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.180]
On the next Steve Dole of Steven Gary Fame.

[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:54.560]
Yeah.

[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.640]
You're the next to Russell Waces.

[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:57.880]
Have a nice life, sir.

[00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.640]
Boy, is he pathetic or what?

[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.480]
1218 in WIOD.

[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.660]
Rico Ramies in the building.

[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:03.520]
We need his fan mail.

[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.300]
I got a letter from a lady who loves you.

[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.620]
And she's about 100 years old.

[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:08.560]
And I recognize the handwriting.

[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.600]
She's been sending me hate mail for 13 years.

[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.260]
I look like an older Tom Hanks.

[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:12.960]
Old.

[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:14.220]
That's the operative word.

[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:15.220]
WIOD.

[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:16.520]
And you please.

[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:17.080]
Speaking.

[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:17.640]
Neil.

[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.560]
Who is that asshole that's on my radio?

[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.100]
Piggy rhythm?

[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:23.980]
Well, what's stationary tune to?

[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:24.740]
That's Debbie Ellis.

[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:25.820]
Don't talk about it, I mean.

[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.860]
But by the way, take a look while this guy is enripping you.

[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.800]
Take a look at the new Sandy Payton billboard there.

[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:31.780]
Wow.

[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.560]
And let's go Marsha to go.

[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:35.180]
Yeah.

[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.260]
That's a man.

[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.160]
He's been a working lakeland.

[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:37.940]
Maybe sea liquors.

[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.140]
Is there going to have a two-man liquor store?

[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.260]
This is a great billboard.

[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.280]
WNWS, the Sandy Payton standing there holding a couple of boobs.

[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:45.420]
Alice and Ellis.

[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.000]
Okay, sir.

[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:47.180]
Nice.

[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:47.940]
So big.

[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:48.640]
Okay.

[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:50.660]
That's cute, isn't it?

[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:52.240]
Should have that coming out of Mike Riner's mouth.

[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:58.380]
Well, we got the perfect spot for Joey now from the Florida Bankruptcy Center.

[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.280]
I don't know what you, it's kind of like a nervous life.

[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:02.760]
What do you reckon?

[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.200]
I don't know what I'm doing.

[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.280]
I didn't want people to know what I think he'd last.

[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:06.920]

[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.320]
The great act.

[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.160]
Okay, if you try to...

[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.400]
All right, just relax.

[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:12.860]
So what if Rick's standing up there?

[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:13.680]
He's going to pull his finger on him.

[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.520]
He's going to pull his finger on him.

[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.020]
He's going to pull his finger on him.

[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.080]
How does he know?

[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.500]
I kiss you and I tell you something.

[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.600]
I don't want to kiss you again.

[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:19.460]
Okay, stop it.

[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:19.700]
I'm like this is bad.

[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:20.860]
I won't tell you anything.

[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.880]
If I don't sleep with you, you're not going to get...

[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.160]
Yeah.

[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.020]
You're going to know all these things.

[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:25.520]
Stick to the guy on the other show.

[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:26.600]
I'll summarize.

[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:27.820]
Yeah.

[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:28.460]
Yeah.

[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:29.760]
How you doing?

[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:30.380]
Okay.

[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.580]
I was, yes, settling with my...

[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.760]
Okay, let's get to it, sir.

[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:36.000]
This is my friend.

[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:36.500]
I was looking.

[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.260]
I found a...

[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.220]
I wonder if Russell Wayson's phone number and home, by the way, if he would realize to us.

[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:42.440]
Joey?

[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:43.820]
No, Russell Wayson's.

[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:44.840]
He's got a lot of spirit time.

[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:45.900]
Oh, I want Joey's number.

[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:46.380]
Do you?

[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:46.860]
Yeah.

[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:48.660]
I found a good place to eat now.

[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.380]
Why you want to date?

[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.100]
Not with Joey.

[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:54.420]
He's got big lips.

[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.560]
No, but he tells me I'll tell you that in school.

[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.220]
That's true.

[00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.420]
In fact, just a minute ago, he's telling me something I can't repeat on here.

[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:01.080]
Now, what is he...

[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:01.660]
Don't do that.

[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:02.480]
What is...

[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.240]
Well, good place to eat.

[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.260]
A couple of young guys trying to get started.

[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.040]
You're 10th sunrise on 44th Street as well.

[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.940]
What is this a free plug you want to give now?

[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.460]
I'm not attached to them.

[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:12.300]
I eat there, though.

[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.440]
You're not attached to them?

[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:13.920]
No.

[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.220]
They're good Jewish boys.

[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:16.920]
Uh-huh.

[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:17.640]
Oh, Publix.

[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:18.860]
I know.

[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:19.560]
It's not a...

[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.120]
It's not a sign of these restaurants.

[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.260]
You're not attached to them, right?

[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:22.580]
No.

[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:23.100]
Okay.

[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:23.420]
No.

[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:24.220]
Peter Pan.

[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.580]
I beg your pardon?

[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:27.720]
Peter Pan?

[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:28.220]
What is it?

[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.140]
A fly-by-night operation?

[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.020]
Serian bread.

[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.380]
Serian bread.

[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.460]
Have you ever heard of...

[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.260]
I'm telling you a few times about Syrian food?

[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.720]
Well, I've what he call it, uh, pizza bread.

[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.480]
They bake it on a premises, delicious.

[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.260]
What is...

[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.580]
Do you ever read in that type of middle Eastern, you know, Syrian...

[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:46.680]
Yeah.

[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.500]
...and Greek.

[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.300]
Joey's big in the Greek.

[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.600]
Fight the eggplant with humus.

[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:52.600]
Yeah.

[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.600]
And hard-boiled eggs in and all.

[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.640]
Have you ever asked yourself for questions?

[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.440]
You have any idea how boring this calls?

[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:00.680]
Have you ever asked yourself that?

[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.760]
Oh, well, then...

[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.000]
Terrific.

[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.060]
I mean, you've given a nice little plug there.

[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.760]
I have no idea what you're talking about, but the guys I'm sure were there appreciated.

[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.400]
They're guys trying to make a living in slavery.

[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.520]
They're close to Chavuach.

[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:14.400]
And of course, opening up a Middle Eastern restaurant for the Arabs in sunrise, I think is probably a good way to succeed.

[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:17.300]
I think I've had great air-fat wallpaper that you got up there, too.

[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.400]
You know, just before the highlight maneuver.

[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:19.780]
Right.

[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:22.000]
Yeah, it doesn't sound like, uh, anyway.

[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:22.540]
Okay.

[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.300]
In closing.

[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.060]
Yes, please.

[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.920]
All my buddies at SAS pool.

[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.300]
You're all douche bags.

[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:27.600]
Okay.

[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.160]
Look at that restaurant.

[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.920]
That's where they blindfold the chicken and shoot at a table.

[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.260]
That's a good place.

[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:32.700]
What is it?

[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:33.420]
Nicosstis?

[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.420]
Oh, that's a far-racing.

[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.760]
You know the thing that I like about you today.

[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.640]
I've never seen this before.

[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.240]
He doesn't even have the cards out now.

[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.260]
He's got them all memorized, which is...

[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.560]
No, they're all thread-by-five, right?

[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:47.240]
No.

[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.960]
Some are a little bigger than others, as you've noticed.

[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.360]
Uh, day-land.

[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:50.920]
Deal.

[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:51.360]
Yeah.

[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:51.980]
How you doing?

[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:52.020]
I'm doing good.

[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:52.460]
Okay.

[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.520]
I lived in Poland because I was driving.

[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.920]
I got a brother who lived up to Mariana.

[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.300]
I want to know what that guy means on a price is right.

[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.200]
When he says, uh, Jose douche bag, come on down.

[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.120]
What does he mean by that?

[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.860]
Uh, I don't know.

[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:04.260]
Okay.

[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.180]
Maybe he might come up.

[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:09.380]
Look at even Sally's brothers has gone to new lowest doing correspondence.

[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.300]
Oh, I didn't play old parts in the convoy.

[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:12.480]
Yeah, we got new band of men again.

[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.200]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.720]
How many of the stuff that people are requesting?

[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.660]
Because these guys have all invaded the show.

[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:46.640]
What is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is, what is

[00:38:53.940 --> 00:39:16.480]
what is, what is there, what is, what is there, I have all these verses, not enough for healthier, and I am talking to my son, that he is not in to the Earth.

[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:16.480]

[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.760]
And he knows your brother

[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:25.780]
That's good, but I was going up there. I had to go through Lakewood. Yeah, and I stopped by ABC liquor. Yeah, through a drag through

[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.840]
Uh-huh, and every time the little bone ring

[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:33.840]
It was like, come on, I'm on the hair. I know. Some guy was just cack. Well, I have no idea who it could have been. Yeah

[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.780]
But I thought you heard of the little P.A.

[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:41.560]
That's cute. That's incredible. You know, it's been a long day. Well, I know a guy who'd love to have you write some material for him

[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:45.460]
He's not once a week, but he does the hell of a show. Really? Yeah. Is it Mr. Major?

[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.640]
I don't want it. No. This guy's on regular

[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:54.080]
You know, I never realize it's being a weird guy, but he's no true boy.

[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.780]
Kate, and she's a...

[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:56.780]
See him. Okay.

[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.160]
26 past noon. What is that? Can we work on my furniture trade-off?

[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.360]
Well, there's an instant furniture. We aren't going to suck around for free beans for you.

[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.040]
We've got free food coming and that should be enough to tide you over to the moral. I also need a bet.

[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.480]
What is that? What is that? Is there any Bruce? I got to move out of the place. What is that?

[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:16.660]
We're living at the mall. This is an article. Did you see the Mickey Rourke movie?

[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:21.700]
No. Wow, Lorquets. You never saw that? He's ugly. He's a very handsome guy.

[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.460]
Oh, jeez. Not always a kiss, but he's got bad taste.

[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.800]
Come on Hollywood. Yeah. Yes. Less than meal.

[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.220]
Of course, he's kissing me. What does that tell you? Yes.

[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:34.260]
I just wanted to say that, you know, we all enjoy listening to Joey Reynolds

[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:37.620]
and we think he's fun and entertaining. The best.

[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:41.400]
And I just wanted to let Joey know that that we're out here, Joe.

[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.080]
And we're just hoping you stay on the air.

[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.580]
Well, that's all, man. Because we think you're talented.

[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.280]
How do we think? Well, we know. There you go.

[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.100]
Don't be a defensive like Bill Marshall. Don't let it rub off.

[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.320]
Don't bother him. Don't bother him.

[00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:02.980]
Good to. And I don't want to bum rap the other people on WIOD.

[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:06.060]
But the only people I listen to in the video,

[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.680]
we listen to Neil Rogers and then we listen to Joey Reynolds on Saturday.

[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:12.880]
What about Rick and Smut? I don't listen to that.

[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.500]
Why not? He's sitting right here and he's got very thin skin.

[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.360]
He's going to be emotional again and have a break down.

[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.420]
I don't think he's that entertaining.

[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:22.480]
He's not entertaining. Joey doesn't feed off the audience.

[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.900]
Joey feeds the audience.

[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.060]
So Joey, you know what I'm saying? You don't hear a butt load of entertainment

[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.200]
in the FDM and their stations.

[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:33.460]
The only entertainer that you got there, Neil, is Neil Rogers and Joey Reynolds.

[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.620]
And there's a lot of people out of the audience that would like to call in

[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.080]
and say the same thing. I'm sure.

[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.720]
Well, we're here to hear it.

[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.100]
And I just hope they keep Joey in. That's all.

[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.580]
Okay. Thank you very much.

[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.520]
Riley's getting red in the face and a host of stories that little Buddha dolly

[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.120]
is sticking a pin right in your cheek.

[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.180]
Well, Joey, listen.

[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.620]
Lots of luck, Joey. We hope you stay on.

[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.360]
That's a lot. And in closing, sir.

[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.260]
And in closing, Neil, I'm going to go on.

[00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:57.120]
That's that, you know.

[00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.960]
28 past, yeah, that's a bad one.

[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.740]
He's going to stay on when they praise me, can you?

[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.080]
I let the guy go on forever.

[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.680]
Yeah, you're right. You did do that.

[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.360]
You let him go on forever.

[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.100]
There's no pleasing you. That's the thing.

[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.280]
If I rip you out, you're upset.

[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.620]
If somebody says them nice about you, if I give you that big toe,

[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.180]
and you don't do that or I mean,

[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.200]
I'm like, or I dig beyond it.

[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.320]
That's like the buffalo hall.

[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.780]
I'm like, hey, it's names under the spin.

[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.900]
I might have a, but that's not the name.

[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.520]
That would be like, if I said Don I miss and Howard Stern.

[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.540]
Yeah, they don't know those names here either.

[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.360]
Are you where they'll need us from?

[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:26.400]
There are people.

[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:26.920]
All right.

[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.520]
A Felipe Rivera and

[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:32.260]
Thomas Gregolano.

[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:33.860]
And Anna is quick.

[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.960]
He says, big is Anna is squeaky.

[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:36.940]
Okay. How do you like that?

[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:37.900]
You feel better now, Sky?

[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.340]
Yeah, I'm a Sky.

[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:40.280]
I'm a Sky.

[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.980]
Well, you know, it's really good to have a hometown feeling here.

[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.400]
I mean, you know, there's people who live here

[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.660]
who grow hometown stations right next door.

[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.360]
They've been weaned on you, Neil.

[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.820]
They're weaning next door too.

[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:50.740]
Right, Sally?

[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:51.460]
Miami.

[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.460]
Hey, Joey.

[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.760]
Yeah, lies on.

[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:54.560]
Here we go.

[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.400]
Hey, Joey, you're no Neil Rogers.

[00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:58.660]
The most that you only kid.

[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.140]
You know Neil Rogers, but on the bright side,

[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:02.580]
you know, stand major either.

[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:05.340]
Somewhere in the middle.

[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:05.980]
Yeah, great.

[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.520]
There's a lot at in limbo.

[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:08.460]
Met's in that.

[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:09.340]
Rush limbo.

[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:10.500]
Joey's okay.

[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.420]
Yeah, he's all right.

[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.120]
Nothing wrong in small doses.

[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:15.480]
Why don't you why don't you make an issue out of me?

[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:16.760]
Why have I become a year old?

[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:17.340]
I'm not this week.

[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:18.380]
What's happening?

[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:19.140]
How are you talking about?

[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.740]
It's all you talk about is me every Saturday.

[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.940]
We never discuss you.

[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.660]
And then I came in Monday morning and Johnny Dark says,

[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:25.980]
boy, you're going to get even a Joey

[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.540]
Chris Johnny Dark as a problem maker.

[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.000]
Johnny Dark is a pig.

[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.440]
He's a big problem making pig.

[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:32.040]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.940]
Buckling exactly very excellent.

[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.620]
Sir, you want to write some material for Joey.

[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:37.220]
He could use it.

[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:37.700]
That was good.

[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.220]
Now I left about half an hour ago.

[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:40.040]
That was for the proof.

[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:40.320]
Right?

[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:40.880]
Well, that was good.

[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:43.440]
Suckling is the perfect word for Johnny Rare.

[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:43.960]
At this.

[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:44.600]
At this.

[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.440]
The man is like a vulture just covering

[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.560]
over waiting for an accident.

[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.460]
That if it doesn't happen, he'll make it happen.

[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:50.040]
A schnor.

[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:50.820]
Exactly.

[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.620]
You're okay in our boat, pal.

[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:54.340]
All right.

[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:54.840]
Say goodbye.

[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:55.260]
Bye.

[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:56.780]
OK, can I play this now?

[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:57.620]
Please look it up, sir.

[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.600]
New kids on the block have been sweeping the country.

[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.060]
And now come Calum day,

[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:04.860]
a little better to do.

[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:05.720]
Get on the block.

[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.520]
Get ready.

[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.820]
Go music with a message.

[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:14.940]
What's in the condo?

[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:18.220]
And now I tell you my wife has just

[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:19.080]
not moved.

[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.540]
Now I keep my

[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.740]
bad notes.

[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:23.900]
Oh, my.

[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.540]
It happened recording on the show.

[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.060]
I've seen the condo with the new

[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.000]
my showman,

[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:29.360]
friends and animals.

[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.880]
Oh, that's it.

[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.940]
I have found my own way.

[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.400]
Go to the open way.

[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.420]
I'm on the phone with some of them down the line.

[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:44.800]
We're driving to the world.

[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.040]
We are the other days.

[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.900]
We're from the coast of our way.

[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.460]
So we come across the street.

[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:51.800]
We walk across the road.

[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.560]
And I talk to my wife and I squirt the white and I can't go.

[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.660]
Oh, parts in the condo.

[00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:00.100]
Carp the door by the album before they expire.

[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.280]
Oh, you're one fine, oh, you're twice.

[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.360]
No, I'm actually a white guy.

[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:06.340]
They raise the price on polygraph.

[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:08.640]
So I'm sorry, I can't leave a pet.

[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.580]
First, there were new kids on the block.

[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:13.400]
Now, oh, parts in the condo.

[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.380]
Oh, my.

[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:17.720]
I tell you my wife has just not moved.

[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.980]
Oh, parts in the condo.

[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:23.600]
Why the album brings the minimum and gets your ticket for the first live

[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.380]
with any wickering bastards ticket outlets.

[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:27.400]
Another cup and go presentation.

[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.760]
I'm dying on the ass.

[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.820]
Okay, well, I keep playing that because you like it.

[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:32.160]
I love it.

[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.440]
1232 at W.I.G.

[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:34.640]
We're going to do another break now.

[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:35.560]
Do we have one?

[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:36.260]
Because I'm lost.

[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:36.840]
I know I do.

[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.200]
Well, we got two more, right?

[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:39.360]
One now and then what?

[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:39.880]
At least one.

[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:40.540]
Where's the few?

[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:40.940]
How's that?

[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.040]
What's time we're going to eat around?

[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:42.640]
Amher's.

[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:43.480]
We're having lunch at C.

[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:44.460]
Oh, I mean, you've been boring.

[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.060]
Who's those in the Taven, New York?

[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.340]
Do you ever eat in Mancuso's?

[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:47.500]
Yeah.

[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:49.720]
Yeah, but I really own the whole town.

[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:50.660]
No, but yes.

[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:51.780]
Yes, it is.

[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:52.500]
It's a great restaurant.

[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:53.380]
Now, where is the food?

[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.280]
I need to eat.

[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:56.120]
I need to be fed.

[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.360]
I've had plus email, you know?

[00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:58.700]
I mean, I just got a disease.

[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.880]
Okay, you got a disease, all right?

[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:02.160]
I wish you'd put spreading it around.

[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.800]
Man, I get downstairs to the counter.

[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:04.260]

[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.460]
I'm going to tell you just came from Madame LaDrex.

[00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:08.220]
What does it matter with my kisses?

[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:09.500]
Am I going to be parry?

[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.340]
Why do you complain about kisses and you're smelling to your wife?

[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:13.280]
Leave them in plantation.

[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:14.980]
1233 at W.I.G.

[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:16.860]
Leave my wife and we will be right back.

[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:18.160]
Hi, the bee.

[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:19.220]
I know.

[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.460]
Dink our strength on the shore if festivals become so popular,

[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.200]
we're going to add something special today.

[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.020]
And what is that, Casey?

[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:27.280]
A celebrity stranger on the shore.

[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:27.620]
Yeah.

[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.620]
And here's our celebrity, Joe Cartierone, each and every.

[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:31.760]
Well, this is a real treat.

[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.240]
Good morning, Dink, good morning, everybody.

[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.000]
It's so nice to be here in Paris.

[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:36.300]
Joe?

[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:38.500]
Okay, so you would rather people's material on the show,

[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:39.380]
we'd do very well with it.

[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:40.420]
Why don't you do it again?

[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:41.020]
Why don't you do it again?

[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:41.500]
I don't have it.

[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.360]
Why don't you always make it fun of Bill and I?

[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.380]
I rather use good material.

[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:45.220]
We have good material.

[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.180]
We sit down, we write.

[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.160]
Well, what are you going to use it?

[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:47.720]
You holding back?

[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.120]
No, I've been playing it.

[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.140]
And you've been playing it too.

[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.240]
So, apparently, it must be good.

[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:52.900]
You're using a second hand and you're getting off.

[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.380]
Oh, man, are you serious?

[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:55.040]
What?

[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:56.540]
Yeah, I'm making it real better.

[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.000]
I feel better about myself without your help.

[00:46:59.180 --> 00:46:59.760]
Thank you very much.

[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.500]
I mean, this was without standing.

[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.260]
It was tasteless and crude and it was great.

[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:04.140]
It was about you.

[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:05.700]
That's why you played it.

[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.280]
With my point, no, it's not.

[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:08.320]
You don't know how about the floor.

[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.360]
The center serving you.

[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:12.040]
Oh my god, here's a man who does four hours on the O'Rodges.

[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:14.260]
Every Saturday, every other word is the O'Rodges.

[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.940]
Why don't you start doing stuff like on the requiemurg?

[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:18.120]
I've learned some things from you.

[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:18.920]
I haven't learned that.

[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:19.700]
Right from Rick Weaver.

[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.380]
No, so you came here to the market.

[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.400]
You're still liking the same mistakes.

[00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:24.740]
You came here and right away, I had that big number then

[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.000]
in the good old days when I had numbers.

[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.180]
And right away, you started kneel.

[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.220]
Every other word kneel is kneel.

[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.160]
It didn't do you any good.

[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.040]
I don't know why.

[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.640]
I never heard of you when I first came here.

[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:34.560]
You came to the world.

[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.040]
I thought, well, I thought, well, I've come here on Midday,

[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.080]
I've come here on an IFM.

[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:38.840]
And all of a sudden, I was on an IFM in the morning.

[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:39.600]
So, what the heck?

[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:41.460]
What drove you over to the Krab body?

[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:42.480]
Of course you did.

[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.260]
But what drove you over to the FM?

[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:44.780]
More money.

[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.440]
Well, why did you come over there?

[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.040]
You didn't know.

[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.140]
All of a sudden, you got jealous.

[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.360]
You were sitting there and you were listening to me

[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.040]
and I make a noise.

[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:50.900]
I got you, jealous.

[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.840]
How long did you suffer from these delusions?

[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:53.280]
No way, man.

[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.640]
They came to me Gary Lawrence, a great Jewish guy.

[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:58.000]
Came to me one day and he said, let's go have lunch.

[00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:59.820]
I knew right away I was going to get a red in the bag.

[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.300]
First of all, that was an oxymoron.

[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:02.420]
Now, you're coming to Zeta.

[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:03.240]
It was dying.

[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.060]
You came in to get sinned.

[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:06.260]
I'm dying on the hands.

[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:06.960]
That's all I said.

[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.420]
And between Led Zeppelin and the CCR,

[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:09.920]
that's on it.

[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.040]
And they needed a morning show desperately.

[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:13.240]
Whatever I gave them the numbers.

[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.520]
And then the brains were going to get up.

[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.980]
We know that when you stepped over the higher you were three.

[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.260]
No, no, no, no.

[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:20.380]
Today at the forty-one, you'll be number one.

[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.500]
We'd rather be number three.

[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:22.240]
Yeah, you're demanding.

[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.200]
Why that's the thing?

[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.140]
They don't be number one.

[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:24.780]
No, number three.

[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.200]
You have taken the information and you've

[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:26.720]
raised on you.

[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:27.920]
Getting so hysterical.

[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:29.420]
Because you're making me lose on the way.

[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:30.680]
The fool is on the way.

[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:31.120]
I'm trying.

[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.220]
Oh, that's a dead one.

[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:32.460]
Where do we?

[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.500]
There we go.

[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.360]
It's a very Jewish people.

[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:35.840]
Yeah, Joey?

[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:36.900]
Yeah, I'm here.

[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.040]
Are you related to Mike Rene?

[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:40.980]
I'd like to be.

[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:42.440]
No, you look like his son.

[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.900]
Looks like his son.

[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:46.500]
The little humor in the lower.

[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:46.980]
I think father.

[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:47.680]
That's the best comp.

[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:48.900]
It may be his father, exactly.

[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:50.360]
Now we're getting close to the truth.

[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.200]
Well, you know, we're all around the same age.

[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:52.820]
Everybody on the stage.

[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:53.560]
I'm the youngest guy.

[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.480]
The only one who does not have a sexual preference problem

[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.320]
on the whole staff.

[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.280]
Yeah, that's why he runs around kissing all the guys

[00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:59.140]
when he's in here, right?

[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:00.180]
Yeah, you've done it.

[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:00.920]
And you have the same.

[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.100]
There's no hangups.

[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.060]
You have the same strange, you know,

[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.760]
turkey skin hanging off the neck.

[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:06.200]
I am.

[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:07.400]
That's for dad's skin.

[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.520]
I have that Nancy regular velocity face cut it out.

[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.580]
They look like a goblet.

[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.180]
Now what's the problem here?

[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:14.440]
What is the problem?

[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:15.580]
Why are you picking on me?

[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:15.840]
Who?

[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:16.360]
You.

[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.640]
I'm just mouthing whatever he says.

[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.180]
If you say you're not right, not this,

[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:21.640]
instead, I mean, why are you on my kiss?

[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:22.920]
When I first came here to see,

[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.220]
I did not know you would say to see that.

[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.020]
I never heard of you when I was on WSH.

[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:27.260]
I came here from New York.

[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:29.480]
They put me on the air with a strange audience.

[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:30.340]
And they all did.

[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.380]
Now you're blaming the audience.

[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.060]
No, no, no, no.

[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.020]
They put me on the audience.

[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.360]
I played and worked off the audience.

[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.560]
I'd like to come here when I came here

[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:36.880]
after Sandy Peyton and Bill Smith

[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.580]
and Bill McQueen and Paul Lyon.

[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:39.720]
How do you like to hear that audience?

[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.300]
She was the queen of talk before you.

[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:42.660]
Well, we got a new queen of talk.

[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:43.020]
I know.

[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:46.100]
So there I was on she in the morning doing my show.

[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.540]
You come along on this AM plain,

[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:52.300]
painfully plain station where WINZ is.

[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:52.580]
Isn't that it?

[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:53.300]
Well, that what it was.

[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:53.820]
I don't know.

[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:54.160]
Yeah.

[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.300]
So you're on the air there.

[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:56.140]
I'm on the air on that.

[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:56.540]
I'm on the air.

[00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:56.580]
I'm on the air.

[00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:57.940]
The whole thing is in the politics of other stations.

[00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.580]
You got jealous about the morning show.

[00:49:59.780 --> 00:49:59.960]
Yeah.

[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:00.460]
OK.

[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.220]
I got jealous.

[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:01.420]
Yeah.

[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:01.900]
I got it.

[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:02.460]
Talking about.

[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:03.260]
That's right.

[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.640]
And then you came over and kicked my ass.

[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.560]
And I called me out here that one time and you said,

[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.980]
I hope you beat me in the ratings.

[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.060]
You were left better than I am.

[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.700]
And we took the cart and we played it.

[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:11.420]
And we played it.

[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:12.120]
And we played it.

[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.540]
And then everybody believed it.

[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:13.840]
Yeah.

[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:14.780]
Well, people do believe things.

[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:15.840]
And you start all these routes.

[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:16.940]
But you started it yourself.

[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.000]
It's like a death win.

[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:19.200]
You have me positioned here.

[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:19.840]
Better than a drunk.

[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:20.500]
Bronson.

[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:21.180]
Death win.

[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.420]
One through 100.

[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.620]
The biggest mistake I ever made was being your friend.

[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:25.680]
I mean, look at what you did.

[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:25.880]
What was that?

[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:26.100]

[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:27.020]
Well, help me.

[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:28.060]
I'm your friend.

[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.400]
And you start crapping.

[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.460]
I heard my friend took my act.

[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.760]
And you ran off with it.

[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.340]
You did a top version of it.

[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:36.420]
And then you come opposite me on an FM station

[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.740]
in the middle of the last guy who was here talking about everybody,

[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:40.240]
like Howard Sternstooler's act.

[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.500]
He went back to the city by the Bay.

[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:44.320]
Now, what is it, ma'am?

[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:44.860]
Are you still there?

[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:45.420]
Yeah.

[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:46.400]
Have a nice day.

[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:46.800]
Bye.

[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:49.080]
OK, let's go to a moral gables.

[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:50.600]
And the Joey Reynolds show with Bill Marshall,

[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.060]
and the O'Rodges, and the Rick and Puts.

[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:53.640]
And Chuck Meyer.

[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:54.620]
You're going to pay for this.

[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.660]
Chuck's in there again because the pirates are hot against.

[00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:58.620]
And now he's sitting there with that smug look on his face.

[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.620]
Hey, a pie trainer lives at crap, you know?

[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:01.760]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:02.780]
Flores, are you there?

[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:03.920]
And why is it?

[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:07.100]
Let's put that on hold.

[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:07.880]
W-I-O-D.

[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:09.040]
Just Campbell?

[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:09.760]
Yeah.

[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:11.680]
Yes, hello?

[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:12.140]
Yeah.

[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.260]
Who's this?

[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:13.900]
Is this Campbell?

[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:14.620]
Yeah.

[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:15.640]
Do you want to be on the air?

[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:16.220]
Yeah.

[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:17.140]
Why do you run right now?

[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:18.100]
Why, yeah?

[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:18.940]
Is this a real call?

[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:19.660]
Yeah.

[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:21.100]
Are you for real, honest to God?

[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.260]
Of course.

[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:23.120]
OK, what do you want?

[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.520]
Do you want to speak to Joey?

[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:25.740]
No.

[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:28.860]
You know, even a pondress telephone has food in the green room.

[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:29.780]
Who do you want to speak out?

[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:30.620]
He's something to eat around.

[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:31.440]
Who do you want to speak to?

[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:32.020]
You want to eat?

[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:32.360]
How long?

[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:33.480]
Here, I'm right here.

[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:34.600]
It's a house lunch, man.

[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:36.080]
I'm not having any lunch.

[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:36.620]
You know what?

[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.380]
It's on a way for Joey and Bill, because there are honored guests.

[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:40.600]
What do you have in there desperate?

[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:41.980]
You're not going to be on eating anything.

[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:42.320]
What do you have?

[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:43.300]
I can't.

[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:43.660]
Why?

[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:44.820]
You can't eat anything at all.

[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:45.240]
What do you have in there?

[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:45.860]
I thought you were my friend.

[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.400]
I'm eating lunch when I go home.

[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:47.880]
OK.

[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:48.460]
What do you have?

[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:49.220]
I take my little pill.

[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:50.040]
I insert it.

[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.380]
I stand up and falls out.

[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.780]
And then what the hell is that?

[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:53.760]
Here's Nicky's bringing him.

[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.480]
Well, here's a couple of apples to get you started.

[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:56.460]
Have a little fruit, Joey.

[00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:57.380]
It's right up your alley.

[00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:58.300]
Now, what do you want, sir?

[00:51:58.340 --> 00:51:59.960]
You've got something in his mouth now we can pass.

[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.080]
What do you want?

[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:02.180]
So how is the coach doing?

[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:03.040]
Not well.

[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.540]
Things are not well in Chicago.

[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:05.980]
But we're getting used to it.

[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:07.240]
Well, San Bernard is out, isn't he?

[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:08.240]
San Bernard's doing it.

[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:10.620]
He's doing the hawk and the other three hits high as night.

[00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:11.520]
And they're doing great.

[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:13.800]
I can't believe that they called that ball foul ball.

[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.720]
Well, I was fair, but this had turned out

[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:16.420]
to make any difference.

[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:17.500]
But give us a lot of excitement.

[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.700]
And that got Zimmer doing a little routine again for us.

[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:20.660]
We need some excitement.

[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.880]
Hey, is that true that there's a restaurant called in the course?

[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:29.460]
There's a restaurant known as a town called Intercourse in Pennsylvania.

[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:30.760]
Oh, that was the restaurant.

[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:32.900]
Well, only if you eat there.

[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:34.380]
All right.

[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.100]
OK, think about it.

[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.400]
Think about it.

[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:38.160]
Have a nice life.

[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:38.960]
Hey, come on.

[00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:39.820]
Are you done?

[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:40.460]
No.

[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:41.640]
OK, there's more.

[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:42.500]
Yeah, there's more.

[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.960]
Joey's something's teeth and there's something real juicy over there.

[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:46.340]
Go ahead.

[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:47.600]
Oh, man, please, that's for me.

[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:47.960]
Yeah.

[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:49.660]
So they all ate meal and they got there.

[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:50.640]
What, wait a minute.

[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.100]
What is this message?

[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:53.720]
What is this message?

[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:58.160]
Well, I mean, you know, I mean, he probably has the hot for you, man.

[00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:58.840]
No, no, no, no.

[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:04.120]
So there's a message here that says for Nick L, it doesn't make any sense.

[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.200]
It's got nothing out of it.

[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:08.920]
This is for Nick L. Oh, I see showing me this from our reception.

[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.500]
And she gave a message as no name and phone number on it.

[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:12.620]
That's a WYOD.

[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:13.920]
We're on top of it, sir.

[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:14.540]
Hey, Neil.

[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:15.020]
Yeah.

[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.520]
What do you think about that new station?

[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:17.760]
97.3 Colts?

[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:18.460]
Oh, the best.

[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:19.080]
The best.

[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:20.520]
I have it on 20 hours a day.

[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.900]
Except from 10 to 2.

[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.640]
Do you think it's better than the 105.9 WXFM?

[00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:26.020]
By a long shot.

[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:26.940]
We have.

[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:27.460]
Yeah.

[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.320]
And our guys don't even have to wear stupid, already caps over there either.

[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:31.100]
I know.

[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:31.900]
Yeah.

[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:33.760]
Oh, hey, I want to come my front.

[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.720]
So you know, he used to have such a big mouth on QAM years ago.

[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:37.160]
Ricky did.

[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.200]
He told him, put a lid on it.

[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:38.820]
He took him literally.

[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.200]
And ever since he's been wearing that thing, he even slaves in it.

[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.620]
He's got more gangrene under that thing.

[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:44.440]
You'd be disgusted.

[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:44.980]
Revolved.

[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.840]
That's why they call him moldy oldies on Waxy.

[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:48.260]
Yeah.

[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.400]
Hey, me, man.

[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:51.180]
Why are you following any of this, sir?

[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:52.140]
Are you having a tension?

[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:53.880]
Or is that what I'm going over your cap?

[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:54.480]
I am, man.

[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:56.180]
But me, why are you always interlocked to me?

[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.120]
I mean, every time I try to get it.

[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:57.360]
All right.

[00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:58.060]
I will say where?

[00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:58.420]
Go ahead.

[00:53:59.160 --> 00:53:59.460]
OK.

[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:00.660]
I was.

[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:02.240]
I'm dying out of the hair.

[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:03.980]
Hey, I want to call my friend, CJ.

[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:04.460]
Good, Greg.

[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:05.020]
Who is it?

[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:05.440]
CJ.

[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:07.660]
CJ?

[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:08.540]
CJ.

[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:08.920]
Yeah.

[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:10.380]
I wasn't sure.

[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:11.420]
Were you sure?

[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:12.240]
Yeah.

[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:12.680]
I was sure.

[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:13.740]
Oh, that's absolutely good.

[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:14.620]
Well, it is good.

[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:15.480]
I was worried for, yeah.

[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:17.820]
Well, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't a little premature.

[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:19.200]
I mean, you waited so long.

[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.360]
Well, I didn't, you know, understand.

[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.700]
We have an open line of dates, 751 WIOD, 751 Joey.

[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:26.920]
Who's that on the bat line?

[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:27.580]
Is that for us?

[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:28.760]
Wouldn't that be a sell-through?

[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.220]
It's a draw after that last comment.

[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:33.600]
Rick Shaw or Rusted Waces again, calling back to you.

[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:34.840]
More for your time.

[00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:35.920]
More tomato Rusted.

[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:37.220]
Don't get enough free time on Saturday.

[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:38.080]
You do fat.

[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.740]
I want some $20 spots.

[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:41.520]
This is what I want.

[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:43.500]
You keep cheap, cheap.

[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.100]
Man, he ought to pay five times a week just to have the right to come on and scream

[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:49.000]
like that on the year.

[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:49.820]
It's disgusting.

[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:54.740]
Wouldn't you be embarrassed if you made millions of dollars screaming and just insulting me?

[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.440]
And how can we be writing those spots on the coast?

[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:01.740]
That's like an easy, you know, a little uptempo, but an easy station.

[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:02.380]
We don't want to hear it.

[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:04.020]
And 85 dollars.

[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:05.940]
I don't know how once you hear that, it ate in the morning.

[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.420]
Well, this is a very successful operation here.

[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:09.120]
What?

[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:10.520]
This radio station.

[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:11.240]
The ad team?

[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:11.620]
Yeah.

[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.180]
No, the radio station.

[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.120]
That's a can he adds.

[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:18.420]
Why do we start or only work off the bad team and put that figure out of business?

[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:18.880]
Okay.

[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:19.760]
Why do you call him a faker?

[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:20.580]
He's very successful.

[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:21.940]
He's still a faker.

[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:24.440]
You know when I first met him, you're not going to believe this.

[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:24.940]
Isn't true.

[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.540]
I worked here two weekends.

[00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:32.240]
1976 before I went to KT.

[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.560]
I'd quit in JNOS Palm Beach.

[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:36.320]
I was not fired.

[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:38.400]
I quit just for your benefit.

[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.300]
And I was not a work as we usually are in this business.

[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:42.280]
And I don't quit work.

[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:42.760]
I benefit.

[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.740]
Bill Carter was working here then.

[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.460]
My good friend Bill Carter, who you've heard of, will be doing your show soon.

[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.260]
And he got me a couple of weekends here to play music on Saturday.

[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:56.940]
And guess who was on for a weekend here playing music before I was on I think two to six

[00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:58.240]
tended to play music.

[00:55:58.420 --> 00:55:59.500]
And it was not in this room.

[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:00.620]
It was like somewhere over there.

[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:02.940]
Russ Oasis.

[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:04.120]
How was this work?

[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:04.960]
Week.

[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:06.640]
You didn't think he was a good one.

[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:07.000]
We are.

[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:08.380]
We.

[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:09.140]
Great.

[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.300]
Like right in the middle of which it's all I'm in my Glenn Campbell.

[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:11.860]
Bill for the mic.

[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:13.620]
85 dollars.

[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:14.740]
What a bad car.

[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:19.900]
Did you see him on television on 57?

[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:20.800]
Channel 57.

[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:24.220]
When he had that show that was much ahead of Saturday Night Live.

[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.540]
They were doing bits together.

[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:27.000]
Are you stucking up with him?

[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:28.020]
I'm asking you.

[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:28.680]
The thing about you.

[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.500]
The thing about you.

[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:30.760]
And I'm not knocking.

[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:31.440]
It's just honest.

[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:34.960]
Joey at least sucks around with people who have a lot of money.

[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:35.920]
I'll fit it.

[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:36.740]
More down in.

[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:39.080]
Of course he went bust and he don't have anything to do with him anymore.

[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:39.960]
Now it's Russ.

[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:40.900]
Okay.

[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:41.820]
No, that's not true.

[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:42.920]
You don't have the order.

[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:47.360]
I mean, if you don't know my MO is, you don't have an idea in the world about my personality.

[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:48.260]
Your Haley is MO.

[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.260]
You still feel like you're wearing it.

[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:54.220]
Projecting what you are that you don't even realize what I am.

[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:55.740]
I don't have to project.

[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:56.820]
Because that's the way you talk.

[00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.860]
I had a 24 hours a day or obsessed with it.

[00:56:58.880 --> 00:56:59.920]
I love Russ Oasis.

[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:00.680]
He's my friend.

[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:01.320]
I am a loyal.

[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.560]
I'm a loyal friend.

[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:03.940]
Can you name a friend of yours?

[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:04.360]
No.

[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.320]
You don't have any left.

[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:06.620]
No.

[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:08.640]
You probably put all your business down the air.

[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:09.100]
Dick Burton.

[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:10.800]
He's not a friend of yours.

[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:11.580]
Oh, trust me.

[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:12.940]
He thinks he's a fan.

[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:13.400]
Loves me.

[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:13.960]
There's a difference.

[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:14.700]
You have a lot of fans.

[00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:17.360]
Well, I'm not going to mention any of my friends because I don't want you calling them

[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:17.960]
starting rumors.

[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.540]
How many friends do you have, any?

[00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:21.180]
You don't have a lot of friends.

[00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:22.460]
How the hell do you know that?

[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:23.980]
Because I know who your friends are.

[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:24.840]
You think you know.

[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:25.520]
I know the both of them.

[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:25.900]
No crap.

[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.740]
I don't even know Rod Roddy.

[00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:28.160]
Where's that?

[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:28.520]
Where's that?

[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:33.920]
Where's that?

[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:33.920]

[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:33.920]

[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:53.060]
I don't know.

[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:55.200]
I don't know.

[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:55.220]
I don't know.

[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:55.220]

[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:55.220]

[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:55.220]

[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:55.220]

[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:55.220]

[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:55.220]

[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:55.220]

[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:55.220]

[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:55.220]

[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:55.220]

[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:55.460]
I don't know.

[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:55.480]

[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:56.200]
I don't know.

[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:56.200]

[00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:56.540]

[00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:56.880]
I don't know.

[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:57.400]
I don't know.

[00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:58.060]
I don't know.

[00:57:58.060 --> 00:57:58.340]
I don't know.

[00:57:58.960 --> 00:57:59.460]
I don't know.

[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:00.480]
I don't know.

[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:00.480]

[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:00.940]
I don't know.

[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:02.100]
I don't know.

[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:02.580]
I don't know.

[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:03.900]
I don't know.

[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:04.220]
That's the end.

[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:04.720]
Are you OK?

[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.160]
See, this is good.

[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:10.220]
Because your witness, this is the difference between me and him except for the paycheck,

[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:15.000]
is that either way to draw the line and I can like, titlate and hang it out there, so to speak.

[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:17.380]
But with Joey, it's like an elephant in a china shop.

[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.300]
Once he gets started, he goes way over the tracks and over the edge and he's out of control.

[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:25.440]
We don't allow lies on a year.

[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:33.880]
It's a...

[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:35.560]
Did you dump that?

[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:36.040]
Yes!

[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:37.400]
Why don't you say it again?

[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:38.780]
You know, like that word again.

[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:39.440]
You won't eat lunch.

[00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:40.120]
I'll take you there.

[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:40.780]
I won't say it.

[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:42.300]
You may eat something but it won't be lunch.

[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:44.740]
But that never made the air.

[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:45.980]
They don't know what we're talking about.

[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:47.840]
If it would have been any way.

[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:49.980]
If it would have been your show, it would have made the air.

[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:51.120]
Oh, that's sick.

[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:51.400]
Because I don't know how.

[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:52.100]
Would you have dumped it?

[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:53.600]
Would you have dumped that?

[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:54.940]
You probably would have without it.

[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:57.080]
No, because you had the guts to dump what he says.

[00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.820]
You're like a whizzling.

[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:00.060]
I'm not even going to start on you.

[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:00.940]
You're like a whizzle.

[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.800]
I can't run into it when Joey says something.

[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:03.780]
What's the big one on the air?

[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.400]
Well, did you want that to go on the air?

[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:06.500]
It's your decision.

[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.360]
Neil, doesn't it make any sense?

[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:07.940]
Or what do you think?

[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:08.900]
Did you want that on the air?

[00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:10.080]
What's that again?

[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:10.740]
Okay.

[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:12.600]
It's seen with this audience.

[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.800]
It doesn't make any difference because they don't absorb any of it anyway.

[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:17.520]
So there's a man in a mushroom farm.

[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:18.380]
All right.

[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:20.340]
Can we talk about Toyota Hollywood one more time?

[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:22.380]
And here's how you weigh in weight, Arnold, is here.

[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:23.440]
Look at how skinny he is.

[00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:26.000]
You never knew him when he was a fat pig.

[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:27.780]
I can say that now because he lost all the weight.

[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:29.360]
He is so slim now.

[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:30.500]
This man used to be fat.

[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:33.040]
And he had a gut bigger than Johnny Dahl, if you didn't believe that.

[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:35.740]
And he slim and trimmy lost all that weight on neutral system.

[00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:36.560]
He looked great.

[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:37.700]
What's the name of this restaurant?

[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:41.800]
Wayne Arnold's, Arnold's Royal Castle, 125th and Northwest 7th Avenue.

[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:43.000]
Isn't it the right set?

[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:47.920]
Mr. Whitehats and the Neely Burgers and the castle Burgers and the birch beer and the

[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:48.460]
good stuff.

[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:50.820]
That you've got stuff down your fat mouth.

[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:51.940]
Are you happy now?

[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:52.900]
What a weenie.

[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:53.480]
God.

[00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:54.460]
Thank you, Wayne.

[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:54.980]
Thanks a lot.

[00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:56.420]
Don't feed him anymore, by the way.

[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:56.820]
Cut it out.

[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:57.300]
This is great.

[00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:00.120]
Okay, 1252 at WIOD, your weenie station.

[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.800]
Let's go to North Miami Beach.

[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.560]
It's from just a jingelope.

[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.260]
And everywhere I go.

[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.040]
People know the fire and I'm playing.

[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:08.820]
Yeah.

[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.600]
Let's go to Hollywood.

[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:12.460]
Hollywood.

[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:13.860]
Go on, that's a line six.

[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:15.580]
Do you ever have purple on it, line six and seven?

[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.000]
Or you never get that many calls, I'm sorry.

[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:21.140]
I don't think we ever have any problems with those lines.

[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.160]
Palm Beach.

[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:24.840]
Yeah, I just want to make a comparison of the Joey Reynolds.

[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.400]
I'm sorry, but I have to be honest with you.

[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:28.020]
I was sorry, but it's lighten up a little bit.

[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:29.160]
We're feeding your free food here.

[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:29.540]
What is it?

[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.120]
I appreciate it.

[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.500]
I want to make a comparison because I know some people haven't seen it.

[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.040]
See what?

[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.360]
I might have kind of reminds me of what?

[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:35.200]
Haven't seen, wait a minute.

[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.140]
It's haven't seen what?

[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:38.980]
I listened to the Joey Reynolds.

[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:39.500]
Okay.

[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:41.560]
See, you used to see it when it was on Channel 10.

[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:42.040]
Yeah.

[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.460]
But then it became too embarrassing.

[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:44.040]
Yeah.

[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.220]
Well, it's going to embarrassing.

[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.080]
Even Joey was embarrassed by it.

[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:49.320]
It's kind of like it reminds me of it.

[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:52.580]
And I commend him for that being honest enough to admit that his TV show is a piece

[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:52.920]
of crap.

[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.980]
I commend him for that.

[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.740]
It takes a big man to be that honest, say, you know, the show sucks.

[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.940]
At least I went up to that.

[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.540]
I don't know how many guys you know, tried it.

[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.240]
It's so funny.

[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.660]
Many of a lot of guys have tried it.

[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:05.520]
It's just like it's big, but it's still sticking up in the air.

[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:06.680]
And it's still kicking.

[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.580]
You know it's alive.

[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.040]
You know, there's still something there.

[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.800]
It's just kind of kicking around and somebody should shoot it.

[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.280]
And they know they should shoot it, but it's too gross.

[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:15.840]
And nobody really wants to go into the background.

[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.260]
1254, W.Y.

[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:20.300]
I mean, that was one of the classy weekend callers of it.

[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:21.100]
And look at this.

[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.900]
Look how long it took superpig to come in here now.

[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:24.900]
I can't believe it.

[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:26.160]
You are a disgrace.

[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:27.940]
Here's all these supplies.

[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.020]
No matter fact, I'm a singing of a lawsuit.

[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.500]
I'm going to call that lawyer.

[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:32.340]
What's his name?

[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:32.860]
Yeah.

[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.140]
It'll work something out.

[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:36.740]
None scary, but I think I'm going to get over it.

[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:37.400]
Okay.

[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.360]
Thank you, young man.

[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.140]
Have a good life here, whatever you're talking about.

[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:40.580]
Miami.

[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.880]
Yes, we've got a special crime check bulletin from your hometown station.

[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:45.600]
Okay.

[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:51.360]
Well, on the police today have arrested another suspect in the recent body dismemberment case.

[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.720]
The suspect is theodore Beaver Cleaver.

[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:57.380]
Q.

[01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:58.620]
Week.

[01:01:59.200 --> 01:01:59.840]
You know what I would do?

[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:01.960]
Sir, what?

[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:03.180]
Get a real job.

[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.520]
No, no, no, Saturday.

[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:08.500]
Right, he's out on three by five cards and slip him under the door on the weekend out

[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:08.940]
front here.

[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:10.020]
Into Joey's office.

[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.240]
No, just in the front door.

[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:11.720]
He'll get him.

[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:12.980]
Okay.

[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:13.420]
Okay.

[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:13.900]
Thank you.

[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:15.060]
WIOD.

[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:16.520]
Okay.

[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:17.180]
Let's leave again.

[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:20.040]
Just before we go down there is always one last hang up on the Palm Beach.

[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.160]
I can't believe I'm not here.

[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:30.400]
You never thought of responding me a slow-witched bitch.

[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.840]
I can't believe that.

[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.140]
When there's trouble.

[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.500]
I can't believe I'm not here.

[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.700]
You made me out of that stuff.

[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.600]
Once you've depressed me it's a piece of bill called as material because we play everybody

[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.520]
else's material on this show and I want to get at least I give credit.

[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.040]
Okay.

[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:52.960]
I don't steal other people's stick and then pretend it's my own.

[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.340]
Well then what is your own material?

[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:55.120]
I don't have any.

[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:55.940]
I know.

[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.020]
Although I have a code and once I was in the airport and somebody came up to me and

[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:00.180]
grabbed it so can that be felt?

[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:02.900]
And I said, Rod, cut the crap.

[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:04.780]
You're like a large parasite.

[01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:05.580]
North Miami.

[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:09.360]
Oh, you're sitting here eating all my spots and your spoon and you're calling me a parasite?

[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.060]
Stick your finger down your throat.

[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:11.460]
Come on.

[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:12.160]
Where's the furniture?

[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.000]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:14.940]
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:20.800]
But let me tell you pop us asses of finger two.

[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:22.140]
Come on.

[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:23.580]
Is that it?

[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:26.320]
But let me tell you pop us asses of it.

[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:27.380]
He's got it on the time tunnel.

[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:28.460]
It's incredible.

[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:30.460]
Are you listening to it back again?

[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:31.560]
Are you getting like a vibration?

[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.760]
You feel like you're doing news at Channel 7?

[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:35.860]
That's a luster buck to you, dummy.

[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:36.300]
Okay.

[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:38.160]
Now there's another friend of yours, the Dean.

[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:40.700]
I don't know Alan Burke that well.

[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:41.180]
I do.

[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:41.740]
I know him.

[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.040]
Well, you worked so good.

[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:44.840]
I was sick.

[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:45.620]
That was very nice of you.

[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:46.300]
It's more than you did.

[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.020]
I don't have your phone number, Neil.

[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.700]
That would be a good way to keep your number in school the same.

[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:53.440]
Bill, what did I tell you today?

[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.600]
And the way to speak for me today?

[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:56.760]
Oh, that you finally found his number.

[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.640]
Yeah, I got from all that other stuff.

[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.040]
Now that I'm back and you want my job, now you find my number.

[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:01.800]
I don't want your job.

[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:02.560]
What do I tell you?

[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:03.160]
I don't want your day.

[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:03.740]
I don't want your busy.

[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:04.760]
I don't want your busy.

[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:06.160]
If you want to go out.

[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:06.800]
If you want to go out.

[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:07.780]
Yeah.

[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:11.120]
Did Joey have any radio experience before his famous highlight career?

[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:12.040]
No.

[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:12.540]
No.

[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:15.960]
But you know where he went wrong?

[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:16.240]
Where?

[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:17.260]
Because he didn't use one of those.

[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:18.220]
Right?

[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.180]
At the top of his career, he dropped the ball.

[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.000]
Is that what I thought of?

[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:21.460]
He was in space.

[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:22.140]
That's where he saw it.

[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:22.600]
He dropped it.

[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:23.420]
Oh, I see.

[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.840]
I feel like the back end of the court is high-line.

[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:26.920]
No.

[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:28.260]
And you look like it, too.

[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:29.560]
Why are you always bashing me?

[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.140]
Does there nobody else to pick on in town?

[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.020]
I'm bashing you.

[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:32.640]
Not you.

[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:32.780]
Not you.

[01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:32.940]

[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:33.100]

[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:33.260]

[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:33.380]

[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:33.640]
Not you.

[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:33.760]
Not you.

[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:34.320]
Not you.

[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.000]
Not you.

[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.380]
I'm bashing you.

[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:40.520]
I'm bashing you.

[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:40.600]
I'm bashing you.

[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:40.600]

[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:40.860]
What?

[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.040]
It's Lincoln Roots.

[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:42.280]
Yeah.

[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:43.700]
This hot's a great.

[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:44.220]
Yeah.

[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.500]
Just keep beating your free food and stuff, but pick it on me.

[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.180]
What do you want, Oscar?

[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:47.740]
What's the next one?

[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:48.600]
Well, that's just my question.

[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:49.280]
Okay.

[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.180]
We'll get you an answer.

[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:51.880]
Four Lauderdale.

[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:52.760]
Hi.

[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:54.940]
I got a Rod and Roddy Spiritsport.

[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:55.560]
Okay.

[01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:55.820]
Good.

[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:57.440]
Let's go to...

[01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:59.080]
Hallendale.

[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:02.140]
Moving right along.

[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:03.580]
Hallendale.

[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:04.820]
They must have died.

[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.760]
Dave County, W.I.O.D.

[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.000]
Hey, Jack.

[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:08.680]
Yeah.

[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:09.320]
How you doing?

[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.120]
What are you doing, dude?

[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.060]
Not too much, Jack.

[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.080]
I'm doing...

[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:12.520]
Dude, Ranch.

[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.620]
How can you stand to be around this lot?

[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:15.400]
Oh, yeah.

[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:15.920]
Here we go.

[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:16.760]
That's what you're people.

[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:18.180]
How can you do it?

[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:18.460]
Yeah.

[01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:19.260]
There's a guy called...

[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:19.960]
Calls all the time.

[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:21.340]
Calls this show every day.

[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:22.620]
Calls every stinking day.

[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:24.060]
Wouldn't miss it for all the money in the world.

[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.160]
And now he's calling and abusing me in your name.

[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:27.060]
Yeah.

[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:28.080]
It's like you have hunting, you know?

[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.520]
You can't be the same room with him, Joey.

[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:30.720]
He's like you have hunting room.

[01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:34.780]
W.I.O.

[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:35.380]
I think Joey's got a great show.

[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.900]
I think Joey's got a great show, too, though.

[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:37.560]
There you go.

[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:38.500]
I enjoy it.

[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:39.720]
In other words, you're easy, right?

[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.460]
I enjoy listening to I.O.D.

[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:42.400]
All through the day.

[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:42.920]
Okay.

[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:43.860]
I just got my weekly news.

[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.220]
We've got some very sensuous pictures

[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.880]
that Joey probably get very excited about.

[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.280]
I got pictures of you with that chicken in the host's

[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.440]
album, so don't tell me about it.

[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:50.580]
Yeah.

[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:52.460]
So is that it, sir?

[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:53.220]
Are you through, Tinklin?

[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.100]
Yeah, that's all.

[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:54.520]
Okay.

[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:55.000]
Thank you.

[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:55.380]
All right.

[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:56.600]
Okay. W.I.O.D.

[01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.040]
Good one.

[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:00.020]
Okay.

[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:01.160]
That's going to do it for this hour.

[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:01.760]
You're all done eating.

[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:02.360]
What are you going to do?

[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.580]
And I can go for that one to two hour

[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:04.440]
that you can dial on.

[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.040]
Okay.

[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:06.180]
They're leaving.

[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.800]
Have a wonderful show this weekend.

[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:08.760]
Don't mention my name.

[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:09.780]
And they'll say, how to rust.

[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:10.880]
Give a big, I love you, Neil.

[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:11.800]
Don't do it.

[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:12.800]
Go with W.I.O.D.

[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:15.000]
Oh.

[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:16.300]
Oh.

[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.480]
What are you doing out of here?

[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:18.860]
Go away.

[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.060]
Call the police.

[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.160]
Call the police.

[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:26.460]
Yeah, Bright has the one o'clock W.I.O.D.

[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.900]
News with a special news bulletin from this studio.

[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:31.620]
And we'll be back with the, I'll be back with the big one to two.

[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:31.740]

[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:31.740]

[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.280]
We'll be back with the big one to two hour after we clean the mess up.

[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.580]
W.I.O.D.

[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:37.860]
Right.

[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:38.860]
Fort Water Day.

[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.780]
A Micronary wakes up south Florida.

[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:43.520]
Tomorrow morning on Newssoft Radio 610.

[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.820]
W.I.O.D.

[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:45.620]
Hello.

[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:46.480]
My guy.

[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.100]
See ya.

[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.020]
Have a great life.

[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:49.880]
Boy, I can't believe it.

[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:50.680]
They're finally left.

[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:52.500]
Hey, butt heads.

[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.300]
It's the one to do, Alex.

[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:54.960]
Now they were okay.

[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:56.500]
They were okay.

[01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:57.780]
They were on the peculiar way.

[01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:58.900]
W.I.O.D.

[01:06:59.580 --> 01:06:59.920]
Yeah.

[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.640]
Now it's just us.

[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:02.480]
What?

[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:04.200]
I said, it's just us now.

[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:05.960]
It's just us now, huh?

[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:07.060]
You and me and Melvin.

[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:08.460]
And Melvin.

[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:09.060]
Hold on.

[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:10.140]
W.I.O.D.

[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:11.020]
Woo.

[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:11.760]
Yes sir.

[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:12.760]
Oh, Neil.

[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:13.380]
Yeah.

[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:15.740]
Oh god, it was in the middle of a profound moment.

[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:16.280]
Well, hold on.

[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.280]
Hold on, you're thinking, right?

[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.460]
I'm trying to, yeah.

[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:18.880]
Okay.

[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:20.380]
Okay, what is it, sir?

[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:22.720]
I'm just calling the sailor.

[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:23.600]
You're in Jupiter?

[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.160]
Yeah.

[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:25.060]
Are you serious?

[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.800]
Yeah, I'm in Jupiter's theater.

[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.600]
Do we actually have an audience up there in Jupiter?

[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:32.780]
Yeah, I listen all the time.

[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:33.440]
But I can't remember.

[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:35.900]
Well, how did you like Joey being in here in this?

[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.140]
Have we ever do it again or not?

[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:37.340]
No.

[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.300]
Let's take a poll on it.

[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:38.780]
Never.

[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:40.860]
Are you serious?

[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.360]
No, I don't know.

[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:44.200]
Give the guy a break.

[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:45.080]
He needs a job.

[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:45.800]
He's desperate.

[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.460]
And I got to be honest, as much as he ticks me off at times,

[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:49.140]
but it comes in.

[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.580]
And you're looking at him with that,

[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:52.200]
sorry, sad, poor Lauren.

[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:53.900]
Look, you kind of feel sorry for him.

[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:55.100]
Like he's not such a bad guy.

[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:55.500]
Yeah.

[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.320]
Then he walks out and you start thinking about it.

[01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.860]
And you say, well, maybe he is.

[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.480]
You get a lot of feedback on him.

[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:01.680]
It's not a talk about him.

[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.720]
Joey's one of those people you really have kind of like mixed feelings about, you know?

[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:05.460]
Yeah.

[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:07.760]
Kind of like a love-hate relationship.

[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.240]
You know, is there a theater?

[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.040]
What is it?

[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.300]
If you've been to the Jupiter's.

[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.360]
I have never been to Jupiter in my life, sir.

[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.660]
Ah, you've got to come up here.

[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.280]
You used to be a part of Reynolds Theater.

[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:16.840]
Really?

[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.300]
New guy just bought it.

[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:19.380]
It's a great food now.

[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:21.660]
And...

[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:22.860]
So it's like a little plug, huh?

[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.740]
Yeah, I'm one of the other men out there.

[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:25.940]
Well, what do you got going up there?

[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:27.700]
Like Debbie, does the dear field or what?

[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:28.660]
What's your plan?

[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:29.400]
Don't not.

[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:30.060]
Is more...

[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:31.260]
Don't not, does dear field?

[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:32.400]
That ought to be pretty interesting.

[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:33.140]
Don't not.

[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:33.960]
You ought to see him.

[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:34.640]
I'll bet.

[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.540]
But anyway, it's a great call.

[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:37.540]
You don't have some lunch.

[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.520]
You won't be able to see him.

[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:39.080]
I'll tell you that.

[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:41.160]
Featured sideways looks like carrying carpenter.

[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.020]
Well, listen, have a great life.

[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:45.680]
Yeah, listen.

[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:47.000]
I'm going to have to call you again.

[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:47.580]
It was worth it.

[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:47.920]
Okay.

[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:48.700]
Take care.

[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:49.420]
How much did it cost?

[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:50.620]
I don't know.

[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:51.420]
It's there for me.

[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:51.900]
Okay.

[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:52.560]
All right.

[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:52.860]
Bye.

[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:53.220]
Bye.

[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:57.060]
Don't expect too much now.

[01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:58.200]
They weren't here for like two hours.

[01:08:59.200 --> 01:08:59.860]
Crawl Gables.

[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:01.960]
I'm just listening.

[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:02.900]
How you doing now?

[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:03.960]
Are you just listening?

[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:05.060]
Yeah, I'm like...

[01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:05.940]
Look it off the phone then.

[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.420]
This phone is for talking, not for listening.

[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:08.740]
Okay.

[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:09.960]
If you want to listen, go buy a radio.

[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:11.940]
What is this?

[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:12.620]
Welcome to...

[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:12.880]
Boka?

[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.200]
You're there.

[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:14.900]
Yeah.

[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:16.320]
Because you just erased you from the board.

[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:17.360]
He's getting way ahead of himself.

[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:19.480]
He came on and asked me if I was still there.

[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:20.120]
And then he...

[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:21.240]
He came on you on the phone?

[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.540]
Well, you know how he is.

[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:22.880]
Boy.

[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:25.080]
Play one car with his voice and right away.

[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.080]
Hi W.R.D.

[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:26.780]
Neil Roger show.

[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:27.540]
He's got a control.

[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:29.260]
I don't have control at Melbourne.

[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:29.940]
Yeah.

[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:30.620]
That's for sure.

[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:31.560]
What's going on?

[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:34.520]
Well, I hear some rumors about things we're going on in your old neighborhood.

[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:36.840]
The two people of the...

[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.500]
The husband and wife of the kids lived like...

[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.660]
Tadi corner across from you.

[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.120]
Got into a fist fight with a guy next to him.

[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:43.720]
Yeah.

[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:44.960]
And...

[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:45.640]
Yeah, I heard about that.

[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:46.740]
With a two by four or something.

[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:48.460]
Or with a hole, the item over the hand with a hole.

[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:49.620]
I don't know.

[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.880]
This was something else in the wife's house.

[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:51.400]
Put another one?

[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:52.120]
Yeah.

[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.740]
The wife's going to get in the middle and she got punched not cold.

[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:57.680]
I'm serious.

[01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:57.820]

[01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:58.480]
Oh, boy.

[01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:00.960]
It's one big happy family at Mayfair, folks.

[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:01.300]
Yeah.

[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.560]
Just a big happy family.

[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:03.080]
Yeah.

[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:04.240]
That old guy on the corner.

[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.180]
He is...

[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:05.940]
Or whatever.

[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:07.180]
I don't know if it's a coisty.

[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:07.820]
Fisty.

[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:08.780]
Oh, yeah.

[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:10.300]
And he's...

[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:11.240]
He's still doing.

[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:14.600]
He put up a big shrub that they didn't want or something.

[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.700]
Or he was on that side of the line.

[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:17.860]

[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:26.120]
Well, it's nice to live with people who get so hysterical and emotional about things like, you know, a leaf falling in their yard or, you know, your dog took something on their driveway.

[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.520]
But that's how it is all over software.

[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:29.600]
No, not really.

[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.260]
Not when you live out in the boondocks here.

[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:32.140]
That's a place to live.

[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:33.500]
I would have frogs in the ducks.

[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:34.840]
That's where he is to go.

[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.420]
Trust me.

[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.400]
In the swamps, yeah.

[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:36.680]
Yeah.

[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.320]
The only way to do it.

[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:39.980]
Anyway, that's about...

[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:41.560]
That's about my story for today.

[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.400]
Except one thing about Joey.

[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.100]
I was at his show, his TV show once.

[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:46.720]
Really?

[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.780]
And he warms up the audience by doing homophobic neo-rodges jokes.

[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.480]
And so he is not worth having him on the show.

[01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:57.240]
So this is a phony tooth-based...

[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.280]
Like I said before, a computer.

[01:10:58.460 --> 01:10:59.700]
Phony tooth-based...

[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:00.300]
Flying ball.

[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:00.940]
Flying bag.

[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:01.620]
That's correct.

[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:03.700]
Well, that's what I said before, isn't it?

[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:04.140]
Yeah.

[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:04.960]
It's exactly right.

[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:06.080]
He has his...

[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:06.760]
Well, I know that.

[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:09.440]
He has a fab floor and look on his face.

[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:12.720]
But he in deep inside is a conniving...

[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:16.080]
Vicious person only, Gerbos could...

[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.720]
In fact, stabbing...

[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:20.120]
Vulture...

[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.220]
Ferrendis...

[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:21.640]
Deuce bag.

[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:22.240]
But not bad.

[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.120]
Yeah, he's not...

[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:23.860]
Other than that, he's great.

[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:24.320]
Okay.

[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:25.160]
Alright, see you.

[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:27.420]
Okay, I'm glad we got the truth out on the table.

[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:29.780]
No, in fact, before we left, he was standing there with his quizzling.

[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:31.720]
And he was going out about...

[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:34.620]
I owe it to you what I am in the market today.

[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:35.760]
And the fact that I'm still working.

[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.880]
I mean, you know, here's a guy who's basically unemployed.

[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:42.220]
And he's standing with a straight face, thanking me profusely...

[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:43.000]
For having a job.

[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:44.860]
Like, even though it's like four hours a week.

[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:47.440]
And if it would have been up to me, they wouldn't let him in the building.

[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:49.960]
So I don't understand what these people are talking about.

[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:55.520]
Whatever happens if it's good or if it's bad, I get credit or blame for it.

[01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:56.100]
Okay, I just...

[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.060]
I don't understand it.

[01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.500]
That would be like Mark Pentrak calling...

[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:00.700]
You're calling right now and he's saying,

[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.360]
Boy, they never would have found those...

[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:05.120]
That stuff in my truck if it wouldn't have been for you in your big mouth, you know.

[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:06.360]
W-I-O-D.

[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.280]
Hey, I want to ready.

[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:08.880]
Yeah.

[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.380]
Listen, I hate Joey Reynolds.

[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:12.840]
This guy...

[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:13.640]
Oh, he just slowed down.

[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.140]
Take a breath.

[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:14.740]
Just relax.

[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.540]
I would have had you a title by a show you're going.

[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:20.660]
It's a little bit too safe, but it's been, you know, the vocal lines have been tied up all day.

[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:21.660]
Well, the lines have been hot, man.

[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:24.920]
The lines were real sizzling when those guys were in here praying that we wouldn't talk to them.

[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.020]
Yeah, but you know what?

[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:28.060]
I mean, the guy...

[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:29.140]
He has a horrible show.

[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.040]
I probably let's do a half hour in total since he's been there.

[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.180]
I mean, hi-hi-ya.

[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:37.360]
That's all he does is a hi-hi.

[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.680]
He's got this sidekick that makes me sick.

[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.000]
All he do is talk about where they work.

[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:48.800]
I mean, can he go a whole show without saying, oh, well, I used to work up in New York or in this place.

[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:49.320]
No.

[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:53.940]
It's like, I only work one day a week, so I got to remind the people that I would use to be big.

[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:55.000]
Why do you use to be big?

[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.740]
He used to be big, okay?

[01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:58.400]
But what's happened to him?

[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.060]
Well, like Wayne Arnold, he used to be big.

[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:01.340]
Oh, what's happened to him now?

[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:01.960]
He's small.

[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:03.520]
He's big.

[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:04.360]
Well, that's...

[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:07.760]
And he does belong on your show and the old man...

[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.240]
Not the big one.

[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:09.680]
You're a big softie.

[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:10.200]
That's right.

[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:13.460]
You should really kick the guy out next time he wants to come in and you've...

[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:16.720]
I enjoy it and I challenge him to come in.

[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:18.180]
I know he's going to be here for two hours.

[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:22.520]
You know, but then Husty was here and he gave me that sad puppy routine that they wanted to eat.

[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.840]
And you notice, as soon as they finished all the food, they got out of here like Grant took Richmond.

[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:27.580]
So they're gone.

[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:32.540]
As soon as they finished and that Johnny Darknext door, who was the biggest pig in the history of...

[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:33.900]
Even Porky would be embarrassed.

[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:35.820]
Once the food is gone, they're history.

[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:36.940]
They're gone, Adios.

[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.100]
Well, you know why they're gone?

[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:40.760]
You want to wait to take a puppy a little bit while I have a wonderful life.

[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.060]
They're going to take for their sex.

[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:43.020]
What is it?

[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.280]
They have to take for their sex.

[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.540]
It's what they ain't got any money.

[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.500]
Is that what it is?

[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.580]
Yeah, because nobody would have...

[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:49.580]
Well, he sure got a lot of free kisses and feels in here.

[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.040]
I tell you that.

[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.100]
I gotta be honest.

[01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:52.300]
Now, I keep telling them that.

[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.320]
I don't know why he does it.

[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.040]
It sounds like it is wrongful.

[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.760]
I'm not joking you.

[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:59.500]
In fact, the people who were at specs in the grove that they saw.

[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.100]
He comes up to you and he just drapes his skinny, ugly, smelly body all over your neck.

[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:10.240]
And he just grabs your head and you're desperately trying to defend yourself.

[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:18.940]
And he plants this big, lip-ridden, tongue-driven, grotesque, wet, sloppy, ugly, smarmy kiss.

[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:22.320]
It's enough to give someone you want to puke exactly.

[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:23.600]
I feel like I'm having a real life.

[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:26.640]
So, as a doctor this morning, we already before coming to work, I'm doing great.

[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:27.300]
Everybody's happy.

[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:27.980]
I'm losing weight.

[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:28.940]
I'm doing fabulous.

[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:29.380]
Congratulations.

[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:33.900]
When I come in here, the man comes in and he's spreading his personal diseases all over my head.

[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:36.320]
Maybe you know what he ought to go over.

[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.360]
Now, you gotta lose for it.

[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:38.260]
I happen to be picky.

[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.960]
Okay, I have better taste than that.

[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:40.960]
But I know you do.

[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:43.680]
The problem is the people that I want to come and kiss me all over.

[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:44.540]
They don't want to do it.

[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:47.180]
Him, he comes in and he sloppers all over my damn face.

[01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:48.700]
It really sounds like he's...

[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:51.600]
In a way or how much I tell him, I'm not joking.

[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:53.140]
He believes I think it's funny.

[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:54.160]
It's not funny.

[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:54.940]
It's sickling.

[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:55.680]
It's gross.

[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:58.840]
Don't allow him on your show anymore.

[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:02.940]
You're fans don't want to hear him, especially you're too soft.

[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.340]
You're a softy all of a sudden.

[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.260]
Well, I am softy.

[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:07.540]
There's no question about that, but I'll see if I can change it.

[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.080]
I love you.

[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:08.660]
Have a great life.

[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:11.560]
Okay, well, the audience is pretty emotional now, which is good.

[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.820]
We like to mull these things over now and then and see if there's still any feeling left in the WIOD audience,

[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:20.100]
which has been battered senseless over the last several months since October.

[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:21.700]
Kendall.

[01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:23.960]
Sometimes I feel...

[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:24.280]
Hold on.

[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.840]
Let's try open park is it?

[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:27.740]
Yes, hello Neil.

[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:28.820]
Where is the US?

[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:29.580]
Where is the US?

[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:30.420]
All right.

[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:30.960]
Okay.

[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:33.200]
What is happening in your life, sir?

[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:35.820]
Well, I was driving down 95.

[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:37.240]
Driving down the highway.

[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:37.820]
Yep.

[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.660]
And I started singing that myself.

[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:41.900]
It's getting so catchy now.

[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.440]
I may replace some times.

[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.500]
Driving from the highway.

[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:46.920]
Oh, it's like I've been driving on highway.

[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:47.860]
I don't know what it is.

[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:48.560]
Okay.

[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:51.500]
I'll tell you the show's a lot of fun today.

[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:51.960]
Yeah.

[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:54.040]
I'm having a good time listening to it.

[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:54.300]
Good.

[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:55.920]
And I'll tell you Joey Reynolds.

[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.000]
I mean, seriously, from the heart.

[01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:58.500]
Okay.

[01:15:58.580 --> 01:15:59.240]
He's a lot of fun.

[01:15:59.420 --> 01:15:59.960]
He is fun.

[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:01.720]
I mean, one of you are going to abuse him, though.

[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:02.400]
Yes.

[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:03.720]
Well, you can tell me.

[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:05.060]
Well, do you think we have such a good time listening?

[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.960]
We have a great time when he comes in here only because I'm allowed.

[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.300]
I'm not allowed, but I just do it.

[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:10.380]
I abuse him.

[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.580]
And the audience, you have him.

[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.560]
And he gets all antsy and hysterical.

[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:14.180]
And it's great.

[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:16.120]
You guys sound like professional wrestlers, aren't you?

[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:19.140]
You see, we shouldn't have Bill Marshall as a sidekick.

[01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:21.200]
He should have somebody who come on and abuse him.

[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:22.080]
The audience would love him.

[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.800]
You have an 80's share, like the old days.

[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:27.360]
He shouldn't have some suckling on her with that phony laughter.

[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:32.620]
He should have somebody that rips him, who is vicious and nasty, like me.

[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.580]
Well, I call him from New York.

[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:36.760]
I think I'm going to come in on this show this week.

[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:38.480]
I'm serious.

[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:39.220]
I tell you.

[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:40.400]
And rip him and ask.

[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.800]
You know, I was in New York this weekend.

[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:43.320]
Okay.

[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:43.840]
Yeah.

[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:45.080]
And I'll listen to how it's done.

[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:49.340]
And his show is one big advertising for things.

[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:50.640]
I mean, he doesn't talk anymore.

[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:51.180]

[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.100]
Yeah, real bad.

[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.360]
Like for Lesbian Diolidate?

[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:54.880]
No, he doesn't even do that.

[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:55.260]
I do.

[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.440]
Well, that's what happens when you make it all that money.

[01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:58.540]
They got to sell a lot of spots.

[01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.560]
Want a lot of spots.

[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:00.240]
We got to break the...

[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.480]
And I listen to him.

[01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:02.920]
He was good.

[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.680]
He was good.

[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:05.780]
He was fabulous.

[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:06.500]
He was fabulous.

[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:06.560]

[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:07.220]
It's a funny guy.

[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:09.440]
And he's got a great sense of humor.

[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:10.760]
And he writes a lot of his own material.

[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.660]
Unlike some of us who steal everybody else.

[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:13.900]
You know what I mean?

[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:15.080]
This is how it's done.

[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:16.240]
This is in the morning.

[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.040]
This is in the evening.

[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:20.320]
This is in the evening.

[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:20.560]
This is in the evening.

[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:20.640]
This is in the evening.

[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:21.540]
See, this show is show bad.

[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:23.160]
We even play other people's jingles.

[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:23.540]
Okay.

[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:23.840]
That's it.

[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:24.540]
And I have no shame.

[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:25.040]
I don't care.

[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.140]
If it takes up some time.

[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:28.520]
I just give you a lot of credit for what you do on the radio.

[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:29.640]
I mean, it is not easy.

[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:31.900]
See, Joe, can I tell you what Joe is problem is?

[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:32.420]
Or...

[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:36.540]
He doesn't understand what I do and why I've been successful.

[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:38.080]
And that bothers him a lot.

[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:40.540]
And underneath all the laughter and all the crap.

[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:41.240]
I'm serious.

[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.560]
He doesn't understand what I do.

[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.800]
And why people like it.

[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.480]
And if you ever figured it out, then he'd have no life.

[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:49.560]
Because his whole life is centered around that obsession.

[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:54.520]
And when I told him how much money I make, when I told him how much money I make, his eyeball,

[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.480]
he looked like Sammy Davis.

[01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:57.960]
His eyeball popped out of the table and he had a grab it.

[01:17:58.060 --> 01:17:58.800]
I mean, he just went nuts.

[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.320]
He went crazy.

[01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:01.040]
He told him.

[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:01.700]
Yeah.

[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:02.660]
How much do you make?

[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:04.020]
I don't do that.

[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.240]
I think that is the craziest.

[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:06.700]
I'm not Steve Keynes here.

[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:07.500]
I would never do that.

[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:10.480]
You know, I listen to Steve Keynes when he was down here.

[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:10.800]
Yeah.

[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.580]
He's been some interesting people on the show.

[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:13.780]
Too many times, though.

[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:15.400]
I mean, the same people.

[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:19.140]
You can only go to the well so often, you know what I mean?

[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:21.340]
That's what the urine lady used to say.

[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.520]
You can only go to the well so often and then it fills up.

[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:25.680]
Let me ask you a very small question.

[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:25.880]
Yes.

[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:27.400]
I got this question.

[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.040]
Okay.

[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.960]
You know, the doctor said I don't think.

[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:30.540]
Okay.

[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:31.740]
Let's go with it, sir.

[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:32.880]
I got this right to do, you know.

[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:36.340]
Well, the question is, you know all these space shuttles that are going on?

[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:36.960]
Yeah.

[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:37.460]
This space.

[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.020]
I mean, every week.

[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:40.060]
And Jimmy Hummel telescope?

[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:40.460]
Yeah.

[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:41.520]
Not even the telescope.

[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:44.800]
Every week you turn around something else is going up.

[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:46.880]
And it's like, you wish.

[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:49.020]
I have no problem.

[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:49.820]
Okay.

[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:52.340]
Every week something is going up.

[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.380]
And like, what is the question?

[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:55.240]
I don't want to know.

[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:56.540]
Do you know what's going up?

[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:01.120]
Is it like TV satellite, like, like, stations sending up satellite?

[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:01.380]
Yeah.

[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.560]
Can I close the call with a little Jewish proverb?

[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:04.040]
Okay.

[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:04.260]
I'll tell you what.

[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:04.840]
I'm going to hang up.

[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:05.260]
You tell me.

[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:05.580]
Okay.

[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:05.980]
Hold on.

[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:06.380]
Good.

[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:06.500]
Good.

[01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:10.340]
What goes up must come down.

[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:11.500]
It's one eighths.

[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:11.500]

[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.080]
Okay.

[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:32.760]
I'm going to hang up.

[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:32.760]

[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:33.100]
I'm going to hang up.

[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:33.540]
Okay.

[01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:34.400]
I'm going to hang up.

[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:34.400]

[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:35.000]
I'm going to hang up.

[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:35.000]

[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:35.020]
I'm going to hang up.

[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:35.020]

[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:35.020]

[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:35.020]

[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:35.020]

[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:35.020]

[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:35.020]

[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:35.020]

[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:35.020]

[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:35.020]

[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:35.020]

[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:35.020]

[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:35.020]

[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:35.100]

[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:35.600]
I'm going to hang up.

[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:35.600]

[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:36.460]
I'm going to hang up.

[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:36.460]

[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:39.760]
I'm going to hang up.

[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:39.940]
Okay.

[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:40.020]
What happened?

[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:40.620]
So, I don't you don't I don't you don't.

[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:40.620]

[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:40.620]

[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:40.620]

[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:40.620]

[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:40.620]

[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:40.620]

[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:41.200]
How am I going to be bothered

[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.240]
by annoying broadheads?

[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:45.700]
Try new signaling dots.

[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.420]
BeUMT 오� embraced.

[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:50.500]
Gross.

[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:53.660]
I've always paid us down that I used to eat it all the time.

[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:55.040]
Step back here.

[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:56.600]
Wow, Bob and I'm...

[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.900]
Oh, I eat you without way of...

[01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.700]
Hey, come on! I'm not eating!

[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:04.240]
Our talks also helps you get rid of pesquian.

[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.760]
You should have this steak rack. Look at it!

[01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:09.120]
Get on that, it's not. You have this rack.

[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:14.140]
The UT-T-O-X.

[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:18.700]
When Bob hits a brother, you will have your blood talks.

[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:24.960]
I'm just sitting here thinking about Joey, you know, because he embugs me.

[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:30.040]
Because he's like a banking case and he's got the same problem that Steve has,

[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.440]
and he's obsessed with me. I don't know why.

[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.380]
Why? What is the problem?

[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:38.460]
What did you find a life, Joey? Stopping obsessed with NeoRodges.

[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:39.920]
All he talks about is all he thinks about.

[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.080]
Comes up and kisses me like my sister, W-I-O-D.

[01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:45.360]
Yeah, I'll rate.

[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.300]
And I don't even have a sister. Yes, sir.

[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:51.320]
That's me, buddy. Hey. Am I on here?

[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.440]
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:53.740]
Give me a favor, Will.

[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:54.840]
Uh-huh. Will.

[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:55.540]
No, you're here.

[01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:56.800]
We'll do it, Bob.

[01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.620]
No, no. We're in all three positions.

[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:00.420]
You know what I mean?

[01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:02.760]
And play this steak for him.

[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.860]
Now, it's that's me, buddy.

[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.880]
Hold on, sir. We'll be going back in just a second.

[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:09.700]
Collect from Wiggly Field.

[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:12.000]
Hello. Hello.

[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:12.760]
Yes, sir.

[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:15.700]
Are you accept the collect call from Jack Quillen, Jr.?

[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:16.140]
Yes, sir.

[01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:17.400]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:17.860]
Thank you.

[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:18.820]
Neo, are you?

[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:19.540]
Okay, Jack.

[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:20.980]
I met Wiggly Field.

[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:23.960]
I'm standing out front of Wiggly Field with Clark and Anderson.

[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:25.460]
It's about 62 degrees.

[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:26.060]
Yeah.

[01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:28.040]
It's a beautiful, you think I'm kidding you?

[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:28.980]
No, I believe you.

[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.180]
Now, I'm out here.

[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.800]
I told you I'd call you when I got up there.

[01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:32.880]
We just got to the park.

[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:35.140]
It's about 65 degrees.

[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:38.040]
Well, I'm glad I warmed up a little because last night,

[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.820]
it was frigid there and Harry wasn't too happy about it.

[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:43.300]
Well, it was a little bit.

[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:45.000]
It was a little bit.

[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.420]
It was a little bit.

[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:47.500]
It was a little bit.

[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.100]
Oh, it was a 48 degrees last night.

[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.060]
It was a 48 degrees.

[01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:52.460]
It's about, like I said, it's in the 60s.

[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:55.940]
Here anything colder than the weather in Chicago last night was the play of the Cubs.

[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.160]
The Cubs looked bad.

[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.780]
Did you hear the warmer in Chicago was?

[01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:01.600]
You're going to move them next year to Manila.

[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:02.140]
Good.

[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.780]
They're going to call them Manila folders.

[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:04.200]
Yeah.

[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:05.120]
Hang on a listen.

[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.460]
I don't go knocking our cubby through it.

[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:08.040]
I'm a cubby fan.

[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:08.960]
I wouldn't be up here.

[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:12.460]
That Kevin Blanket, you can pick on some of it to many things.

[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.240]
I don't know if this guy just rambles on.

[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:14.880]
Go ahead.

[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:15.560]
I'm sorry.

[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:19.220]
They can't hold someone to the jack women with the cub games.

[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:19.800]
Yeah.

[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:20.720]
You want to hear it?

[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:21.120]
Sure.

[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:21.700]
Okay.

[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.260]
Wait a minute.

[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:22.640]
Wait a minute.

[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:22.900]
Wait a minute.

[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:25.240]
He's telling Joey to call Nick as soon as possible.

[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:25.920]
What does that mean?

[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:27.480]
What is that?

[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.080]
Is that a message for me to put on the air?

[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:29.840]
Is that it?

[01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:31.960]
Have Joey call Nick as soon as what Joey?

[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:33.340]
Marvin.

[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:34.800]
What Joey?

[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:37.580]
Joey rambles to call Nick as soon as possible.

[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.900]
So while you're in your car, pull over to the phone with you.

[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:40.340]
Got a quarter.

[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:41.780]
Get the quarter from Bill Marshall.

[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:42.840]
And call Nick.

[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:43.860]
He's got a job for you.

[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:44.580]
Yes, sir.

[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:45.140]
Okay.

[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:52.940]
It's a beautiful day for a ball game, for a ball game, to be.

[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:56.580]
Depends on how to get a ticket or two.

[01:22:57.100 --> 01:23:02.980]
And while a while a Washington, to Calamans, it's a beautiful day for a long run.

[01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:05.820]
Why then a trip is okay.

[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.780]
We're gone to cheer and boo.

[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:12.240]
And raise a hour of the moon at the top game.

[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.020]
Two days later.

[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:14.420]
Oh, no.

[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:15.240]
Hurry up.

[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:15.560]
Yeah.

[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:16.540]
How you doing, Bill?

[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:19.380]
I'm just wondering why we're going to go.

[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:20.960]
We're going to go to the new building.

[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:24.700]
But today I should call the truck to check out the next two.

[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.220]
Oh, right.

[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:26.260]
Let's go to the stage.

[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:27.700]
Of the drinking series.

[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.120]
Holy cow.

[01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:30.560]
Ha ha ha.

[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.640]
See how I love you, baby?

[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:33.220]
I love you.

[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:34.580]
I love you.

[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:36.100]
I love you.

[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:37.200]
I love you.

[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:37.960]
I love you.

[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:38.500]
I love you.

[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.120]
I love you.

[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:40.860]
I love you.

[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:41.160]

[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:41.880]
I love you.

[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:42.180]
I love you.

[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:44.060]
I love you.

[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:47.980]
I love you.

[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:49.180]
I love you.

[01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:49.780]
I love you.

[01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:50.640]
I love you.

[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:51.520]

[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:51.980]
I love you.

[01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:52.040]
I love you.

[01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:52.400]
Okay.

[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:54.580]
Any other messages you want us to give out?

[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:56.340]
Or can we go ahead and do the show now?

[01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:59.320]
Tell them Nick just to crawl onto the table and say there.

[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.820]
Where do these people in this place are?

[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:01.260]
Nuts.

[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:03.800]
26 after 1 at WIOD.

[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:05.440]
By the way, we've got a new fall line of coming.

[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:05.820]
Enjoy.

[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:07.220]
We'll be talking about that on Saturday.

[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:08.140]
Kendall.

[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:13.400]
Sometimes I feel that life is time to see me by.

[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.440]
Mm hmm.

[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:16.040]
Mm hmm.

[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:17.300]
Ville.

[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.240]
Haven't heard that much.

[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:19.320]
Did they have with you?

[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.020]
You could say that again.

[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.840]
I always had people just interrupting our show.

[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:23.080]
We haven't had our regular thing.

[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:23.400]
Have we?

[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:24.040]
Nope.

[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:25.700]
Here we go.

[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:27.280]
Ready?

[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:27.820]
Yeah.

[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:28.340]
I'm ready.

[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:29.200]
I'm always ready.

[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:29.600]
I'm ready.

[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:33.780]
Sometimes I feel myself.

[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:35.400]
Feel better now.

[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:35.880]
Yeah.

[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:36.340]
OK.

[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:37.860]
So what's up?

[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:38.580]
Nothing much.

[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:39.840]
Oh, relaxing.

[01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:40.620]
Good.

[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:41.940]
Enjoy Joey today?

[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:43.020]
Not really.

[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:43.580]
I know.

[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:45.440]
Pretty ponderous, huh?

[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:46.440]
Dredchful.

[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:50.200]
How many times have we ever heard about how big it wasn't buffaloed and how it was a WNBC?

[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:51.900]
It used to make all the money used to have a job.

[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:52.800]
You know, forget it.

[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:54.100]
Nobody cares about the past.

[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:55.660]
I think you said that.

[01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:55.800]
Yeah.

[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.980]
It would be like my saying, hey, I got the giant numbers.

[01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.660]
You know, that's in the past.

[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:01.420]
We're just holding our head above water.

[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:02.860]
We're treading water at this point.

[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:05.200]
Nothing lasts forever, you know?

[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:05.860]
Yeah.

[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:07.480]
Even desperation, I think, isn't it?

[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.040]
Yes, sir.

[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:09.860]
Which is right next to Cheek-Dawaga.

[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:13.080]
Hey, me and my wife.

[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.280]
That's where Joey kisses you on the Cheek-Dawaga.

[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:18.900]
I'm telling you, if he ever got around you, you would call a police.

[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:20.280]
I'm telling you, call a riot squad.

[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:22.000]
The man is out of control.

[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:23.740]
Look out for him, man.

[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.740]
I mean, if he'll probably eat you up one day.

[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:26.720]
I'm afraid so.

[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.480]
If not, my type, believe me.

[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:29.520]
Not anybody's type.

[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:34.380]
Well, hey, me, I think this is a day to forget, right?

[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:35.040]
What do you think?

[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.180]
I would agree.

[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:37.320]
Let's just cross it off.

[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:38.000]
Do you think it is?

[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:38.340]
I mean, this is...

[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:39.160]
Tomorrow is going to be great.

[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:40.060]
You will go in real, man.

[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:41.120]
Marked my words.

[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.540]
Tomorrow is going to be great.

[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:43.540]
You think so, what?

[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:44.840]
You're right. I just had that feeling.

[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:45.940]
I can feel it in my bones.

[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:47.380]
So we just touch against the moon.

[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.800]
It was my special guest, Rod Rodi.

[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:53.560]
He's going to come in with his silk suit from the price is right.

[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:55.180]
You're not going to believe it's going to be phenomenal.

[01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:56.500]
And how about Howard Stern?

[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:57.400]
And Howard.

[01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.680]
We're going to do lesbian dilatants,

[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:01.400]
going Rod Rodi and Howard Stern.

[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:03.100]
Have a great life, sir.

[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:03.720]
Oh, you two, me.

[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:04.060]
Adios.

[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.220]
128 at WIOD.

[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:08.340]
Now we're picking up just a little bit of steam, eh?

[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:09.820]
Poor Latterdale.

[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:11.820]
See what I mean?

[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:12.720]
That's at line six.

[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:14.040]
Are you there?

[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.880]
I heard somebody like Belcher puker something on there.

[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:18.640]
WIOD.

[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:19.820]
Deal.

[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:20.180]
Yeah.

[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:21.000]
How are you?

[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:21.520]
Okay.

[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.140]
Let me ask you one quick.

[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:23.640]
I know.

[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:27.180]
I have questions from getting a headache from all the questions today.

[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.380]
Howard, can we just go back one second?

[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:29.840]
Sure.

[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:31.120]
You give me just a second here?

[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:31.720]
Absolutely.

[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:34.960]
See, I didn't have time when they were here because I was so overwhelmed by their presence.

[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:36.700]
But, uh, all right.

[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:37.360]
Let's start again.

[01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:38.080]
Hello.

[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:38.880]
Hello, Latterdale.

[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:39.920]
No question.

[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.360]
Do you have a question?

[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:42.980]
Oh, my God.

[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:44.720]
Oh, God.

[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:45.400]
I got the purr.

[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:47.400]
I got to realize we had this other card.

[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.040]
I don't even know we got all this material.

[01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:49.840]
But let's start again.

[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:50.880]
Do you have a question?

[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:52.520]
What's the answer to the question?

[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:54.180]
What do you got?

[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:54.560]

[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:55.220]
Wait a minute.

[01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:58.000]
We got the other one where he says, uh, where the hell is the other one?

[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:58.960]
He says, what's a question?

[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:00.560]
Where the hell is that one?

[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:01.720]
Here it is.

[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.620]
Well, God, we got all three of them.

[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:06.160]
We got a Larry King trifecta.

[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:06.960]
Do you have a question?

[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:07.940]
What's a question?

[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.260]
What's the answer to the question?

[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.260]
Oh, let me get it on.

[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.260]
Oh, man.

[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:11.900]
Incredible.

[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.140]
Now you feel better?

[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:13.960]
Oh, God.

[01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:14.600]
Not yet.

[01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:17.460]
I mean, there's a guy with a bigger nose than Joey and more money, too.

[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:21.540]
Why does Larry King give Joey one of his jobs?

[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.840]
He's got about 85 jobs.

[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:23.840]
He don't need all that money.

[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:24.400]
Right?

[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:26.300]
Get him off our back.

[01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:27.540]
Give him a job already.

[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:29.100]
He wants to be ubiquitous.

[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:30.620]
No, he wants to be me.

[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.440]
That's his problem.

[01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:32.320]
Oh, he's not as eating.

[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.020]
Did you see the little blurb in the paper this morning about the FBI and the finger-lake's track?

[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:38.340]
No.

[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:39.120]
Oh, you didn't?

[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:39.500]
No.

[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:39.960]
Oh.

[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:42.520]
Were they investigating Ross Morton?

[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:42.880]
No.

[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:45.320]
What they did was the FBI bought the thing.

[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:45.740]
They're investigating.

[01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:48.440]
They're going to charge him with impersonating a track announcer.

[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:49.500]
Oh, yeah.

[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:50.260]
He's terrible.

[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:50.880]
The worst.

[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.400]
Oh, this guy at Clasers, worse than Ross Morton.

[01:27:53.400 --> 01:28:02.320]
Boy, Bill Calder is going to be so upset because Tony Bentley is a good friend of his, but everybody I've spoken to has said that Tony Bentley is laying an egg at Calder that the chicken little will be embarrassed.

[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.920]
I mean, you try to be objective about it.

[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:04.720]
It's just terrible.

[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:09.600]
The guy in trouble, I know you got this new guy at Hollywood Park in California, a young Australian.

[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:10.680]
Oh, I heard him.

[01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:13.140]
Oh, you're not going to start with Trevor Demman now, are you?

[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:14.040]
No, absolutely not.

[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.040]
You're not the Trevor Demman guy.

[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:16.640]
No.

[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:17.400]
Oh, you've got to be.

[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.240]
No, I don't know.

[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:20.840]
I heard him last night on a Harvey Pantheon.

[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:22.840]
And he sounds like Trevor Demman Jr.

[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:23.300]
Right.

[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:24.680]
And what they said is true.

[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.080]
For one race, it's different.

[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:27.380]
For nine races, for that.

[01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.980]
Oh, is that what they were talking about?

[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:29.200]
Yes.

[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:36.120]
Because I didn't, I was reading the paper and I was watching it in the background because I always watched that show every night because it's a good show.

[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:37.120]
Harvey Pantheon is great.

[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:38.340]
Yeah, he's the best.

[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.000]
And the guy that John Watson didn't know.

[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.220]
Yeah, he's good too.

[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:41.560]
Yeah.

[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:46.880]
And it's a fun show if you like horse racing and I headed on and then I heard the guys boys and they showed two races.

[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:47.560]
Right.

[01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:52.200]
And then I heard him say something that I didn't catch and then I thought that's what he said.

[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:55.160]
And I thought, no, he can't be ripping the track announcer because they would never do that.

[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.580]
So they were ripping them, but he just started last week.

[01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:58.160]
He's a newbie.

[01:28:58.360 --> 01:28:59.200]
24 years old.

[01:28:59.340 --> 01:28:59.960]
He's from Australia.

[01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:02.140]
I don't know.

[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:04.220]
And he uses all those British expression.

[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:04.500]
Right.

[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:06.420]
They're on the straight and they're been.

[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.800]
I mean, they've wondered the first corner.

[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:10.160]
But I mean, they're on the straight.

[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:13.580]
We don't use those expressions in America.

[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:13.980]

[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:15.440]
You're going to come here and call the race.

[01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:17.180]
Don't try to bring a Sydney with you.

[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:18.200]
Leave Sydney and Sydney.

[01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:18.580]

[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:19.320]
I agree.

[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:20.600]
I was telling you Randall would say.

[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:24.540]
No, they did a finger like the FBI was investigating race fixing.

[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:26.200]
They bought a cheap cleaning board.

[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.940]
Oh, no, not a finger like.

[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:28.540]
Yeah, they were.

[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:30.340]
God, I can't believe that.

[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:30.800]
They were.

[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.620]
And they bought a cheap place.

[01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:34.040]
This is in the sports section this morning.

[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:34.760]
This little bird.

[01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:38.000]
They bought a cheap clamor who painted its own rent.

[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:38.880]
Let's put it that way.

[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.360]
They did find no evidence of race fixing.

[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:41.800]
Of course.

[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:43.160]
We know that would never happen.

[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:45.100]
Not in the last racing.

[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:46.240]
You know finger likes.

[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:46.960]
I sure do.

[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:47.340]
I sure do.

[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:48.380]
I was there the day it opened.

[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.100]
You could.

[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:50.960]
You could.

[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:51.320]
You could.

[01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:51.540]
You could.

[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:51.660]
You could.

[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:52.480]
You could cast where I went to high school.

[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:53.040]
Can't in big.

[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:53.480]
When you're.

[01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:55.380]
You could build a bigger track in your backyard.

[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:56.200]
And finger like.

[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:56.960]
That's incredible.

[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.440]
Why do you think Ross Morton works there?

[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:02.780]
You know that he applied for the job of color this summer.

[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:03.480]
And they turned him down.

[01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:04.420]
It's a goodness.

[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:05.280]
Yeah.

[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.280]
First go soft.

[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:07.420]
Did you heard anything from him?

[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:08.800]
I talked to Phil at a length.

[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:09.220]
He didn't want to.

[01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:10.340]
No, he's not.

[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:13.500]
He didn't get that job because they discovered they had a

[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:14.460]
Hara Canadian citizen.

[01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:15.680]
So he got screwed on that.

[01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:19.460]
Then he was going to a Hollywood park and they didn't want to give him a contract.

[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.540]
And the lady that owns a track out there evidently is real flaky.

[01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:27.660]
And as a history of hiring and firing people every week and he didn't want to pick up and go all the way out there and

[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:29.020]
You know, have a bad deal.

[01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:30.680]
So he just took the summer off.

[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:31.700]
But he called me.

[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:32.780]
He's going to the track every day.

[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:33.320]
He's doing great.

[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:35.180]
But he's not announcing the race.

[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:36.100]
No, he'll be back.

[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:37.060]
Do you like Phil Georgia?

[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:38.540]
Oh, I hate him.

[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:39.580]
Oh, do we?

[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.060]
He is the most overrated now.

[01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:42.800]
He's the most eager to come.

[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:49.540]
He's the most eager, mystical, poppies, self-aggrandizing, next to Trevor Demmon.

[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:51.140]
I love your thoughts with Nathan Hanson.

[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:51.760]
That was great.

[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:53.500]
Well, we've got the Belmont coming up.

[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:54.100]
He'll be calling again.

[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:54.480]
No, no.

[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:55.980]
No, Mr. Fisky, by the way.

[01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:56.740]
You know that, don't you?

[01:30:56.860 --> 01:30:57.040]
Yes.

[01:30:57.260 --> 01:30:58.260]
But there's going to be Ander.

[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:00.140]
Forget Yonder.

[01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:01.360]
Yonder's a piece of garbage.

[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.520]
Yeah, but at least it lends a little interest to the room.

[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:09.840]
The greatest thing that I ever saw, one of the greatest moments in my life, was seeing Easy Goer get a desperate third, and I met Mila.

[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:10.860]
So I'd again last night.

[01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:13.560]
I can't see it enough because I don't dislike the horse.

[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:14.800]
But I hate Pad Day.

[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:18.700]
And I dislike the people in New York who refuse to give another horse credit.

[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.840]
I mean, Sunday Silence is a better horse.

[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:28.600]
Easy Goer is a one-run horse, which is why you notice in a lot of those big races last year, he would baby him and baby him and make a one big turn.

[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:29.740]
They say, oh, he waited too late.

[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.260]
It's a one-run horse.

[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:34.220]
And if he makes it move too soon, like he didn't this way, the horse hangs.

[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.060]
He's got nothing left.

[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:37.380]
He's not as good as they think he is in New York.

[01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:38.300]
Okay, trust me.

[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:39.980]
No, you're exactly right.

[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:41.460]
Do they think he owns Donald?

[01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:41.980]
They're wrong.

[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:48.480]
You see, when you have a horse like Sunday Silence that's usable, I can go to the lead or race from just off the pace or come from the middle of the pack.

[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:49.640]
That's a horse.

[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.520]
When you got a horse that, like, is way back, it's like Alibar.

[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:54.060]
And Alibar was a good horse.

[01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:55.940]
But he had one big run.

[01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:57.020]
Okay, and that was it.

[01:31:57.020 --> 01:32:00.160]
Where's the form could run on the lead or from behind or whatever?

[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:01.860]
That's a great horse.

[01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:06.160]
But if I was saying to someone yesterday, in the bedroom, Alibar has a firm beak.

[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:07.960]
Well, that's an understeer.

[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:08.960]
What a stire.

[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:11.040]
Anyway, see you at the sandbox.

[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:12.080]
Okay, bye-bye.

[01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:16.760]
Yeah, we'll be out to sandbox one of these days because Carter was in here with me yesterday and got around pretty good.

[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:19.400]
He's been, he really has been very sick.

[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:22.360]
A lot of people realize that and we're not going to go into the details on the air.

[01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:25.340]
But he's, you know, had, and just like I was very sick with the stroke.

[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:27.420]
But he's coming along real well.

[01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:28.000]
He looked good.

[01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:30.780]
Sounded great because Al gets a little sun, gets a little color.

[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.120]
He'll be just like back to usual.

[01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:33.360]
He's putting some weight back on.

[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:37.840]
And then we can go out to the sandbox and have a few laughs with those $40 claimers.

[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:38.720]
Right?

[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:40.740]
We'll even take working puts out there one weekend.

[01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:42.020]
Now you guys can get hooked.

[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:43.560]
I'm telling you, yeah, come on.

[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:46.220]
We'll let Joey give me the money.

[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.520]
Okay, Joey will give me the money.

[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:48.620]
If come on, have a good time.

[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:50.020]
You guys got to try something new.

[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:51.580]
By the way, Joey thinks you guys are a pathetic.

[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:52.660]
You know why he says that?

[01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:53.880]
Because he wants you job.

[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:58.220]
Don't ever drop the coast when Joey isn't a hallway.

[01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:00.000]
Trust me, I'm just going to put some advice.

[01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:02.240]
Also, quit leaving all your stuff in there.

[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.420]
I had all that copy left on that chair.

[01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:07.820]
See all the stuff that I had a salvage for you on your spots.

[01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:09.940]
Try to get a little more organized.

[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:13.300]
Okay, and when you steal my cards, at least put them in order in your briefcase.

[01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:13.740]
Okay?

[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:15.360]
God, these guys are on mess.

[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.040]
More gables.

[01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:19.720]
Are you still having trouble with your satellite dish?

[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:20.300]
No.

[01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:21.220]
What happened?

[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.240]
We're finally having with that.

[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:23.200]
What finally happened?

[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:23.620]
Yeah.

[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:24.260]
I moved.

[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:26.000]
The out of plantation?

[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:27.740]
Out of that area.

[01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:30.840]
Oh, because we are the same problem in the city of Coral Gables.

[01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:32.760]
Oh, well forget Coral Gables, sir.

[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:33.720]
Coral, can I say?

[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:38.440]
Unless you get a duck that you tied to the roof and put the dish on a duck's bill.

[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:41.660]
At least you, they can't prevent you from getting a satellite dish.

[01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:42.280]
They can only...

[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:44.260]
They just make it so difficult that you wish you were dead.

[01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:45.880]
Oh, right?

[01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:47.620]
Well, I mean, it didn't work that?

[01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:48.120]
Yeah.

[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:54.500]
Now, also, what happened with the voice of GTR, the Noxious Moon,

[01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:57.360]
where it's on your station, Channel 7?

[01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:58.260]
Scott Chapin.

[01:33:58.640 --> 01:33:59.260]
Is he still there?

[01:33:59.520 --> 01:33:59.820]
Oh, yeah.

[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:02.360]
They don't use him on the new coat.

[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:03.940]
So, we got Mitch Lewis on here.

[01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:07.800]
I haven't figured that out why because Mitch usually is the AM production guy,

[01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:09.760]
and Scott has been pretty much the FM guy.

[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:13.280]
But Scott's got his own little business over there with Sally and Channel 7.

[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:15.220]
He's got a whole little industry going in that room.

[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:16.000]
Hi, Meg.

[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:17.200]
No, we're not going to tell you a show, Meg.

[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:17.840]
All right.

[01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:20.980]
Did you see what's your name on TV yesterday?

[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:22.080]
What's that?

[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:22.520]
Debbie?

[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:24.260]
No, I did not see it.

[01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:25.820]
No, we only have a little Sony in here.

[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:26.780]
The screen isn't that big.

[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:27.760]
Oh, well.

[01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:29.700]
She was on two channels.

[01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:31.940]
I think she was big, big, big, open up another channel.

[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:32.200]
Yeah.

[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.580]
The one next to C-Span.

[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:34.380]
I want to write next door.

[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:35.720]
No, 23 and 44.

[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:36.380]
Uh-huh.

[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:37.780]
C-Span and C-Span too.

[01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:38.280]
Yeah.

[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:39.560]
And then every other thing...

[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:41.840]
Every other thing, she's going to be in the English Channel next week.

[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.200]
And fill it all up.

[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:45.320]
You all found that one.

[01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:46.500]
Well, dude, I'm not a material.

[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:48.500]
And the English Channel is...

[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:49.200]
Nope.

[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:51.100]
It's like a body of water.

[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:53.200]
Oh, hold on, hold on.

[01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:55.900]
Okay, madam chair.

[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:57.740]
The last guy that did that, you know what happened to him?

[01:34:58.020 --> 01:34:58.600]
He hung up on?

[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.280]
No, he's in San Francisco.

[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:02.420]
So, how do you...

[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:03.380]
But...

[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:03.500]
Any way.

[01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:05.500]
Anyway, you know, this appeared.

[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:07.660]
I don't know why this card disappeared.

[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:10.140]
And I came across, I was devilish and stuffed this morning.

[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:11.820]
And I found it again.

[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:13.040]
Now, this is one of my favorite cards.

[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.560]
Nobody ever requested because it's not really timely.

[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:16.460]
But I like it.

[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.240]
W-I-O-D.

[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:18.080]
Hello?

[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:18.700]
Hold on.

[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:20.340]
And so, I'm going to play it again.

[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:23.560]
I like it.

[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.020]
Okay.

[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:26.180]
I mean, if you don't like it, too bad.

[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:29.160]
Scary tales can come true.

[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:32.280]
It can happen to you.

[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:36.280]
If you're scary heart...

[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.220]
I'm going to start singing.

[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:39.840]
While the white is away.

[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:42.840]
If it's sound, how's your play?

[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:45.120]
If you're scary heart...

[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:45.120]

[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:45.120]

[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:45.120]

[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:45.540]
If your game is...

[01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:47.780]
If you're scary heart...

[01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:51.100]
A big prize you'll pay.

[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:53.300]
It was a win and you played.

[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:56.780]
Not one, it was white.

[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:59.740]
You were caught with this prize.

[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:02.640]
You're really not too smart.

[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:05.600]
You can't stay apart.

[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.540]
Now you won't be president.

[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.280]
Gary heart...

[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:14.640]
You won't be the president, no.

[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:17.580]
Gary heart...

[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:18.060]
What a read.

[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:19.140]
What a job.

[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:20.020]
Great.

[01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:23.680]
Not as good as this.

[01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:25.660]
This is kind of fun.

[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:26.880]
See, this is kids.

[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:27.720]
They're really good for.

[01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:28.420]
We don't have to wait.

[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:29.140]
There's nobody.

[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:30.720]
There's nobody.

[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:32.700]
There's nobody.

[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:34.420]
That's just that.

[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:37.100]
You'll find yourself somebody.

[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:40.140]
Search yourself, anybody.

[01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:43.600]
Find yourself somebody.

[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:45.600]
Do we have...

[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:48.000]
Find yourself somebody.

[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:48.220]
Thank you.

[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:52.740]
My son Francisco's got a weird city anywhere.

[01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:54.600]
21 till 2 at WIOD.

[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:55.840]
Hi, Alia.

[01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:56.960]
How you doing, Neil?

[01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:57.620]
Okay.

[01:36:58.020 --> 01:36:58.800]
What's your up to, guy?

[01:36:59.080 --> 01:36:59.620]
What am I up to?

[01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:00.800]
Get ready to go home, sir.

[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:01.980]
Get ready to go home?

[01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:03.500]
Yeah, get ready to hit the road.

[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:05.620]
You're not going to mom's lunch today?

[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.500]
No, I don't want to go on Tuesday, sir.

[01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:09.060]
If you're keeping in your diary.

[01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:11.760]
I don't want to go on lunch and my mom's later on.

[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:12.420]
What you making?

[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:13.480]
I don't know.

[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:18.360]
It's either between Turkey and at Rose Chicken Barbecue Style.

[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:19.620]
Rose Chicken Bud?

[01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:21.340]
Take something like that.

[01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:21.600]
Yeah.

[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.500]
I just wanted to tell you one thing.

[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:25.400]
If you ever have any internal problems.

[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:26.200]
Couple.

[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:29.080]
Because a lot of times we think that our parents are dumb.

[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:30.800]
When you're young, always think of parents don't have anything.

[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:34.500]
If you ever have any internal congestion.

[01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:36.260]
Remember one thing.

[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:37.940]
Mom's know a lot about it.

[01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:39.800]
They're the experts.

[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.360]
They know their stuff.

[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:42.620]
Definitely, definitely.

[01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:43.460]
Trust me.

[01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:45.600]
They know their...

[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:46.820]
Believe me.

[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:50.060]
I read in the paper that some lady married bacon.

[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:51.460]
She was...

[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:52.940]
She was a jockey and she was pregnant.

[01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:53.700]
Yeah.

[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:55.680]
And she was actually in a race.

[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.100]
Is that legal?

[01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:58.320]
Why not?

[01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:03.700]
I mean, you know, she could hurt the baby or, you know, maybe the track she felt.

[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:05.120]
Well, how about if the horse was pregnant?

[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.180]
This is the horse was pregnant, too.

[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:07.620]
Yeah.

[01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:08.500]
Well, that happens.

[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:11.080]
Mayor's run while they're carrying something.

[01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:11.720]
Really?

[01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:12.140]
Sure.

[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:13.660]
Oh, I never heard of that.

[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:14.200]
Oh, yeah.

[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:16.480]
And there's some of the guys, too, the jockeys.

[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:17.060]
Oh, yeah.

[01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:18.300]
That are in the family way.

[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:19.540]
Listen, who do you like tonight?

[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:20.820]
The pisses are the bulls.

[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.180]
Ah, well, who do I like?

[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.400]
You know, I want to see the bulls win, because I like...

[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:24.900]
I don't know.

[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:25.520]
I really don't care.

[01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:27.940]
But I think the pisses are home are going to be tough, right?

[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:28.640]
Yeah.

[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:32.080]
And they really choked the lines to Game Boy in Chicago.

[01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:33.060]
Sure did.

[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:36.060]
Those bulls are a different team when they're in the friendly confines.

[01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:36.940]
All right, Neil.

[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:37.980]
Good job, guys.

[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:38.960]
Okay, say hi to Mommy.

[01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:39.560]
Hi, Neil.

[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:40.940]
Okay, because Mommy's hearing those...

[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:42.760]
Stuff.

[01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:46.500]
Let's go to, let's see, it's Lady and Davie.

[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:47.480]
Hi, Neil.

[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:48.180]
How you doing?

[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:48.780]
Fine.

[01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:49.440]
How are you?

[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:50.040]
Great.

[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:50.800]
Good.

[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:52.640]
I wanted to cast my ballot.

[01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:53.340]
Okay.

[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:55.640]
Well, you're the guest.

[01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:57.460]
And by Joey's grade, too.

[01:38:57.820 --> 01:38:58.120]
Is he?

[01:38:58.300 --> 01:38:59.620]
And the two of you together are fantastic.

[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:00.600]
Oh, my God.

[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:01.840]
And I see you're going to encourage him.

[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:03.420]
And the audience is going to get hysterical.

[01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:04.740]
My audience hates him.

[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:06.240]
Oh, but he's so funny.

[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:08.720]
Oh, Rick and Puts is another story.

[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:09.500]
Well, let me ask you something.

[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:11.180]
How come he's funny when he's on here with me,

[01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:13.280]
but when he's on Saturday, he's, um, terrible?

[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:15.720]
Well, I live until my Saturdays when I can,

[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:16.840]
but I don't have an opportunity on Saturday.

[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:18.260]
And you think he's funny on Saturday?

[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:19.180]
Yeah, you.

[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:20.620]
Oh, compared to one.

[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:21.160]
Compared to one.

[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:22.200]
Compared to one.

[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:23.080]
Like sports songs?

[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:23.880]
No, no.

[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:24.440]
He's funny.

[01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:25.160]
Okay.

[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:25.840]
He's so quick.

[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:27.520]
I want to ask a question.

[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:30.040]
Well, that's because he's memorized all those three by five cards.

[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:33.040]
When you get that old, it's like, you know, like Reagan.

[01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:33.700]
Sure.

[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:35.080]
I can understand.

[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:35.200]
Yeah.

[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:36.840]
It just flows out.

[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:37.560]
How old is he?

[01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:38.240]
Who Joey?

[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:38.620]
Yeah.

[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:38.940]
Buddy.

[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:40.280]
Oh, wow.

[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:42.840]
I wonder why he had all those wrinkles all over his face.

[01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:46.100]
When he sat here with a straight face, tried to tell me I'm the same age that he is.

[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.940]
I mean, that's just one of the most bizarre things I've ever heard my nobody has said

[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:50.180]
old.

[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.200]
No, I don't think so.

[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:52.660]
I don't think so.

[01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:56.340]
Because I was like a little kid and diapers growing up, listening to you and Joey and

[01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:58.680]
WKBW and Buffalo, and he admits that.

[01:39:58.840 --> 01:39:59.060]
Yeah.

[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:01.380]
When you're just aging faster than he is.

[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:02.800]
He has his big numbers up there.

[01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:03.900]
How come he's down here?

[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:05.460]
That's a good question.

[01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:06.660]
Well, he loves it here.

[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:10.120]
He loves the ambiance and he likes his amazicus.

[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:11.100]
The weather's great.

[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:12.480]
I love it here.

[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:12.840]
Yeah.

[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:13.340]
I think so.

[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:14.100]
The weather is great.

[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:14.480]
Period.

[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:15.000]
Yeah.

[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:16.060]
Big period right at the end of that.

[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:16.520]
Right.

[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:17.400]
I can't do that.

[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:17.820]
You have two more breaks.

[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:18.680]
Oh my God.

[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.580]
Can I ask you a question?

[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:21.280]
Real fans.

[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.300]
Can I call Ed a douchebag?

[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:24.080]
You just did.

[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:25.540]
Can I call Bob a douchebag?

[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:26.160]
I just did.

[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:26.700]
Say goodbye.

[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:27.420]
Okay.

[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:28.800]
142.

[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:29.460]
I'm sorry, Melville.

[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:31.420]
We're getting behind what I'm telling you about the melting pot.

[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:32.820]
Now that fabulous fond.

[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:38.760]
It's the second time I've done that.

[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:39.300]
It's good.

[01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:39.820]
Open the pot.

[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:40.920]
It's just on that last note.

[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:41.760]
W-I-O-D.

[01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:42.860]
Shocking.

[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:43.360]
I got through.

[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:45.180]
Well, that's because I picked it right up.

[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:46.020]
Unbelievable.

[01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:49.420]
We had all these other people who are now panicking because we got to do another break and they're

[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:50.800]
going to run out of time and not get on the air.

[01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:51.540]
Oh God.

[01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:53.760]
Do you have another juper call?

[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.060]
Don't you feel bad about that?

[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:55.680]
Not at all.

[01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:55.960]
Good.

[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:56.760]
Not at all.

[01:40:56.940 --> 01:40:57.700]
So what's your story?

[01:40:58.560 --> 01:40:59.520]
Who do you want to plug?

[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.100]
I don't want to plug anybody.

[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:03.280]
Instruction workers.

[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:03.540]
Oh.

[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:05.760]
Because they love you too.

[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:06.900]
They what?

[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:07.740]
They love you too.

[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:08.120]
Great.

[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:09.340]
Can you believe that?

[01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:10.740]
Yeah, I believe anything you say.

[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:13.640]
You're too trusting, Neil.

[01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:15.080]
Yeah, that's what Joey said.

[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:15.660]
That's it.

[01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:17.420]
And by the way, before the third kiss.

[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.480]
By the way, don't ever let him on the air again.

[01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:20.540]
No, that was a bad mistake.

[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:21.480]
Unbelievable.

[01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:22.740]
Kill the show.

[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:23.340]
It sure did.

[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:24.880]
And I'm not going to make it any worse.

[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:27.700]
And then Nick just came in here and said, what was that all about with Joey?

[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:28.540]
Do you ever call you back?

[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:29.660]
No, I said, what was that about?

[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:30.400]
No, nothing.

[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:33.980]
He walked out with a look like he just swallowed 40 canaries and a cat.

[01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:35.220]
Nickhead?

[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:36.080]
Nickhead.

[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:36.560]
Oh, OK.

[01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:40.920]
I'm telling you, there's like this insatiuous little like all the quizzlings in the building.

[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:42.900]
They all kind of suck around together, you know what I mean?

[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:43.420]
Mm-hmm.

[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:44.320]
I believe you.

[01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:45.000]
I'm serious.

[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:46.340]
Whatever happened to P.P.

[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:47.740]
He called yesterday.

[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:48.500]
Did he really?

[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:48.860]
Yeah.

[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:50.320]
I wrote a song for him.

[01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:50.800]
Great.

[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:51.900]
Can I tell you it?

[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:52.300]
No.

[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:53.020]
I can't.

[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:53.620]
Have a nice day.

[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:54.820]
Thank you.

[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.360]
We don't have time.

[01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:57.180]
North Lauderdale.

[01:41:57.180 --> 01:41:58.680]
Neil, I need a little bit of advice, please.

[01:41:58.860 --> 01:41:59.280]
Yes, sir.

[01:41:59.400 --> 01:41:59.840]
Just a little bit.

[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:00.440]
OK.

[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:06.620]
I got this job offer to spend the summer in Martha's Vineyard with rerent, lots of money.

[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:07.180]
Great.

[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:08.020]
A really good job.

[01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:14.320]
Or I can stay here at the job that I hate like boys and making very little money.

[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:14.800]
Uh-huh.

[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:16.740]
Wedding my butt off all from the long hair.

[01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:17.020]
Right.

[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:18.320]
Which should I get for?

[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:20.600]
Which way should I go?

[01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:21.580]
Is that a tough question?

[01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:23.280]
Which way should you go?

[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:25.140]
I thought the question was, what's job should you do today?

[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:25.920]
Which job should I go?

[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:27.740]
When does it have been here?

[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:28.580]
Did you ever been there?

[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:29.580]
Yes, once before.

[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:31.540]
Oh, it's like paradise in the summertime.

[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:32.580]
It's great.

[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:33.240]
Great.

[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:40.280]
And the food up there and the people and the sand and the wind and your hair and under your knees and just great.

[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:43.260]
I'm just worried there won't be enough people that will say, funny.

[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:44.920]
I'm going to get out of the way.

[01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:46.020]
There, that's right.

[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:48.020]
You'll miss that, but other than that, it'll be great.

[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:48.660]
OK.

[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:50.380]
Then I think I will go take the job.

[01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:52.620]
It was, I mean, and I'll call you from up there.

[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:53.520]
Yeah, call us from up there.

[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:54.040]
I sure will.

[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:55.940]
It'll be, you know, you won't have much else to do.

[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:56.340]
Thank you.

[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:57.320]
And one more thing.

[01:42:57.460 --> 01:42:57.600]
Yeah.

[01:42:57.860 --> 01:43:00.380]
Puts is my idol because he gets paid to do nothing.

[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:01.120]
That's correct.

[01:43:01.340 --> 01:43:02.300]
No, Puts is my idol.

[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:02.640]
OK.

[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:03.260]
Thanks very much.

[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:05.480]
OK, let's take a mobile and ponby.

[01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:05.880]
Hello.

[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:06.560]
Hi, Leo.

[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:07.140]
Yeah.

[01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:08.860]
This is Pat from the remote.

[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:09.720]
No, it's not.

[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:10.640]
What are you doing?

[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:11.580]
Matt was here yesterday.

[01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:13.540]
OK, he don't speak like that, Twini.

[01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:16.260]
Another call at me.

[01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:17.680]
They don't waste your time with you anymore.

[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:18.880]
And you have to know the call us.

[01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:20.780]
Let's go to a four-letter day.

[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:20.980]
Hello.

[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:21.840]
Hi, Neil.

[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:22.280]
Yeah.

[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:24.220]
I got something for you, ready?

[01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:26.260]
No, I don't want to hear Trevor Demonet.

[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:27.040]
Wait, wait, wait.

[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:27.520]
What is it?

[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:27.940]
Hold on.

[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:30.460]
Believe me, it's going to be that guy from Hollywood Park.

[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:30.980]
Trust me.

[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:47.660]
Hava, the Gila, Venice, Mexico.

[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:55.920]
Hava, the Gila, Venice, Mexico.

[01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:03.980]
Hava, the Rana, Hava, the Rana.

[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:06.800]
Hava, the Rana.

[01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:09.780]
Kaka, the Gila, Fanny.

[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:13.000]
I was standing.

[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:14.680]
OK, let's do that last break.

[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:16.940]
It's just a little thing that we're going to slip right in here.

[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:18.040]
We'll be right back.

[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.180]
We've got to slip in here.

[01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:19.640]
This one would be unlucky.

[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:20.440]
Boca.

[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:22.000]
My wife is the same as you.

[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:26.060]
I used to call her Hoover.

[01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:26.880]
You could do it.

[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:29.560]
She's like a vacuum.

[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:30.260]
Yeah.

[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:32.220]
Let's go to a Davy.

[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:32.480]
Hello.

[01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:37.560]
Whenever I hear Joey, the pain starts with my testicles and works with...

[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:38.840]
Oh, let's go to Miami.

[01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:39.260]
Hello.

[01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:39.860]
Neil.

[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:41.320]
Yeah, they're getting good now.

[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:42.920]
Yeah, they're getting really exciting.

[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:44.420]
I want to ask you a question.

[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:44.940]
How did...

[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.220]
I'm under pressure.

[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:47.900]
Yeah, well, it's getting...

[01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:48.560]
The whole show's been...

[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:49.520]
No, we'll take it for granted.

[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:50.900]
I have one question.

[01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:52.420]
What the hell happened to us today?

[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:53.740]
How do we get sucked into all of this?

[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:55.280]
I don't know, but I have an important question.

[01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:55.840]
What...

[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:57.320]
How did Joey ever...

[01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:00.940]
I mean, I don't know how famous he was before because I'm not that old, but...

[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:02.240]
How did he ever get on TV?

[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:06.900]
Thomas Rumas, do I ever hurt?

[01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:07.820]
All right.

[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:09.100]
It was an accident.

[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:09.920]
Oh, really?

[01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:10.260]
Yeah.

[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:14.240]
He was panhandly in front of Channel 10 out of this game, Boulevard.

[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:17.360]
And Anne picked him up into a truck.

[01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:19.840]
And they thought he was a talent.

[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:21.980]
You know, he said, oh, you've got a show coming out of here, when inside.

[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:23.900]
And they threw money here with that cardboard audience.

[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:24.260]
Really?

[01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:25.920]
Well, that show nation-wide is just locally.

[01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:28.040]
Are you still a nation-wide?

[01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:29.060]
The Kurnovs.

[01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:29.320]
Yeah.

[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:33.160]
There were some of the cable companies that were threatening to take Channel 10 off of it.

[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:34.320]
It is still off here.

[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:35.600]
Nation-wide.

[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:39.160]
Let's leave the embarrassment to this limited area.

[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:40.360]
Yeah, he's glad we did.

[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:40.880]
Well, I don't know.

[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.640]
You know, I still...

[01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:46.920]
Awful odor all over my face now from him being in here and just...

[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:47.060]
Oh.

[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:47.860]
I don't know, Neil.

[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:48.400]
I tried to...

[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:49.620]
I planned him.

[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:50.460]
What's that?

[01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:52.220]
I said it's a clammy feeling.

[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:53.520]
Yeah, that's not a good thing.

[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:53.900]
You.

[01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:55.100]
Not a good thing.

[01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:57.860]
But I mean, I've tried to listen to him a few times.

[01:45:58.100 --> 01:45:59.300]
You know, because I was your ripy.

[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:00.740]
You know, he's always talking about you.

[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:02.660]
I mean, I don't find anything interesting about that game.

[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:03.440]
Now, he's basically...

[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:05.220]
He's four hours to talk about me.

[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:07.360]
And now he has lots of races from the ad team coming.

[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:09.720]
And he talks about me, you know, for four hours with him.

[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:10.540]
And that's it.

[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:11.720]
They try to make a shot of it.

[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:12.780]
Now, you know what I'm funny though?

[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:15.280]
He really, really thinks he's funny in it.

[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:16.260]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:16.760]
I know.

[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:17.800]
It's a bit...

[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:18.640]
It's really embarrassing.

[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:20.720]
He just, you know, maybe came to like, selling...

[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:21.900]
So he roses them.

[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:23.180]
In Cyclopetias would be good.

[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:23.640]
What's that?

[01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:25.200]
In Cyclopetias would be good.

[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:25.800]
Yeah, that's...

[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:26.180]
That wouldn't be a bad thing.

[01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:29.520]
You have to wear a bag over his head because we're not going to the door if you saw Joey.

[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:32.200]
The one who would be shrieking, called 911 immediately.

[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:33.980]
Yeah, it would be horrible.

[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:35.780]
But, hey, we got to go on with our lives.

[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:36.260]
Exactly.

[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:37.060]
All right, Neil, take care.

[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:37.780]
Have a great week.

[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:38.180]
Bye-bye.

[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:42.360]
And what better call to take next on the Bolfeline?

[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:45.260]
You know, who was so desperate to get on the air and do his little stuff,

[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:46.940]
a grandizing pump up his own ego.

[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:52.720]
You know, here I am pounding the pavement, humiliating myself when you got...

[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:53.700]
Are you sure it's the pavement?

[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:56.880]
Ruff...

[01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:56.880]

[01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:57.440]
Ruff...

[01:46:58.060 --> 01:46:59.380]
Ruff away to the whole team.

[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:00.600]
Oh, I'm million.

[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:01.500]

[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:02.060]
And age.

[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:03.500]
You know, off the air, I said enjoy.

[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:05.180]
I said let me ask you if the...

[01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:07.540]
Situation were reversed.

[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:13.900]
If Russell Waces was doing 10 to 2 on IOD and you, Joey, were a multi-millionaire, okay?

[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:18.720]
When you hang out on Saturday and come in and, you know, to be desperate to be on the air,

[01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:19.980]
he said no way.

[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:20.880]
You have to be nuts.

[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:21.760]
Yeah, why do you do that?

[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:22.640]
That's my point.

[01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:23.560]
I have no idea.

[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:24.600]
Ego.

[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:25.600]
Man, let's go.

[01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:27.080]
See, I want to tell you something.

[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:29.380]
When you get that kind of money, you don't need to have an ego.

[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:30.900]
You can do whatever the hell you want.

[01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:31.680]
And I just...

[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:34.640]
I just pity people whose egos are so big that they're getting away.

[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:36.520]
Of enjoying all that money.

[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:39.660]
And he doesn't want to enjoy the money, let him sign it all over to me.

[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:41.860]
He can come in here and do 10 to 2 everyday.

[01:47:41.860 --> 01:47:42.880]
There he goes.

[01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:43.540]
There he is.

[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:44.300]
Give me the check.

[01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:45.120]
That's all.

[01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:46.360]
I don't understand.

[01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:46.960]
Incredible.

[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:48.000]
I don't know how that is.

[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:50.700]
People with these inflated egos that call up talk shows.

[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:53.280]
Well, what would it be like when...

[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:54.440]
What would it be like when...

[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:54.520]
What would it be like when...

[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:59.140]
Want to be personalities and show up at remote with their pasty complexions and try to...

[01:47:59.140 --> 01:47:59.620]
Hey, everybody.

[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:01.340]
Speaking of show like...

[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:03.020]
It's a fun time that you paint on with a brush.

[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:04.800]
Tonight at Dirty Mose.
