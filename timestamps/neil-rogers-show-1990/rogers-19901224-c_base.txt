[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]
That was the days of Anita Bryant and all that.

[00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.460]
I've admired you ever since, but anyway.

[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.860]
December 17, 1976, so it's like almost exactly 15 years.

[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.340]
Yeah, and a week.

[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.900]
But I had a dream last night.

[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.020]
I had a dream that Miami Beach was filled up and they had to see those.

[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.080]
Yeah, but he was having a good time.

[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.160]
I think Delusion would be the word out of dream.

[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.840]
And, uh, all the time.

[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.700]
And at Mickey McNickel, what nine races Wednesday at a pompadot park, you also dreamed that.

[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.140]
Yeah.

[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.480]
Just a joke, Mickey, relax.

[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.640]
Okay, it's only a race.

[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.260]
You know, if there was one good thing about Alex Bennett and here comes Raymond Scholar on the far outside.

[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.380]
You ready?

[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.860]
Yeah.

[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.060]
It was one good thing about Alex Bennett.

[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.380]
I got the so it's here to Alex Bennett.

[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.420]
I got to see the studio.

[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.380]
Oh, you were in the live studio audience.

[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.680]
Yeah.

[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.040]
Yeah.

[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:57.680]
I was one of two and I got to see Tiki Farco and Tom Jicke and I actually got to see a.

[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.520]
Inside working of a studio, whatever.

[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.140]
And it was fun.

[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.920]
Uh-huh.

[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.820]
And he is as bald as you say you and wrinkle and old.

[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.160]
Yes.

[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.620]
Yes.

[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.920]

[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.600]
And in closing, I'd like to call Bob and BD, a douchebag and Frank and Rosalie, my parents.

[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.780]
Thank you.

[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.260]
Okay.

[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.980]
Good luck to you, pal.

[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.840]
No, do it again.

[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.460]
Well, this I don't this chord.

[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.380]
Can we I mean, this is supposed to be a real radio station.

[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.900]
I say supposed to be can we get a chord in here that isn't got a short in it?

[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.900]
I like to kind of like stroll around the room here and the roll around on the floor on this

[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.560]
roller and go from rack to rack and pretend like Mr. Hotshot.

[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.760]
And every time you like tug on your chord here, it starts crackling.

[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.740]
You ever have that problem you start tugging on your cord into crackles.

[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.160]
A pay phone from Keebus game.

[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.360]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.860]
Okay.

[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.600]
You know, I've been waiting for this for a long, long time.

[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.040]
Got five or three finally.

[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.800]
We got a game got father.

[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.820]
Oh, that's good.

[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.580]
That's good.

[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.000]
Yeah.

[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.100]
You kill me every time you do it.

[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.400]
Anyway, every time I do what?

[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.720]
Every time you play the music.

[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.960]
Yeah.

[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.440]
You know that they're seeing when when Michael goes with K, the last one.

[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.000]
When the Godfather starts into the Marlon Brando.

[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.080]
Remember, he's telling him that whoever comes in who can kill him.

[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.680]
Well, he is not in that scene.

[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.320]
That's out in the gardener in the backyard.

[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.720]
Yeah.

[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.360]
Well, the next to the last one, when Michael starts into...

[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.840]
Whoever brings you this meeting is there with Trader.

[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.460]
Just remember that.

[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.640]
Hey, Marlon Brando and Michael are following on here right now.

[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.280]
Ready to music?

[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.980]
No, I'm good.

[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.620]
Okay.

[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.600]
It's planned.

[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.100]
Hey.

[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.600]
Michael.

[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.380]
Michael.

[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.480]
How's your family?

[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.100]
Is anyone with them?

[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.200]
Yeah, cause it's a little man takes care of his family.

[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.780]
No.

[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.000]
Why is my genie big?

[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.000]
Well, it comes to you that I die with.

[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.000]
You know what?

[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.500]
You know what?

[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.860]
Man, man.

[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.360]
And boys can be...

[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.160]
be me killers.

[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.720]
But man, kid.

[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.620]
And I will choose to be a foe in all.

[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.800]
I will choose.

[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.920]
I will always run in Michael.

[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.560]
I will run this field.

[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.400]
I will always tell you to be put in this field.

[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.500]
Santa Rogers.

[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.360]
Santa New Rogers.

[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.980]
Santa New Rogers.

[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.800]
I will leave you here.

[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.600]
I know you've done a good job.

[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.100]
I hope your first child is a masculine child.

[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.680]
I love what you then you are.

[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.220]
1225 at I.O.D.

[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.380]
Boy, anybody who says that that isn't the most powerful movie in the history of the film industry is full of crap.

[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.860]
Okay?

[00:03:49.220 --> 00:04:01.740]
It just kind of like permeates every cell in your body and every cell in Arcadia, at BCC, not BCC, BCC, JL and BCC.

[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.620]
Most of those kids at BCC couldn't get arrested.

[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.380]
Fort Lauderdale.

[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.260]
Hello?

[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.220]
Yes, sir.

[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.020]
Yes, Mr. Rogers.

[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.720]
Yes.

[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:25.680]
Have you seen the Godfather when they put the boat together and you see all of the scenes what cuts out to both movies?

[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.300]
Yes.

[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.160]
That is incredible.

[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.220]
You know where the guy who blew up the car with his wife in it?

[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.540]
Yes.

[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.660]
And he finds him in a TV...

[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.000]
Fabrizio in New York.

[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.640]
Fabrizio, prepare La Manca.

[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.720]
Hey.

[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.660]
Listen anyway, I have a whole story.

[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.340]
It's going to crawl to you.

[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.820]
It's going to win by a head.

[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.660]
Have a great life, sir.

[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.780]
Boy.

[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.780]
By the way, how about that guy from England, the other day, Frank?

[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.800]
He was okay at the mode.

[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.520]
He was a good guy.

[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.580]
He won the Zuba pants.

[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.280]
And he was going to go back and show him off to the Queen.

[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.000]
He was good.

[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.820]
There were a lot of people there who were real good of all kinds.

[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.320]
Well, that was a great remote.

[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.400]
I don't want to just overdo it, but the charcoal's remote was fabulous.

[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.360]
We had a great time.

[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:22.040]
We had a just fabulous group of people there, including several that we're going to get personal invitations right to our studio.

[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.480]
Miami.

[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.100]
Neil.

[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.620]
Yes.

[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.560]
I just wanted to correct one more point.

[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.760]
There.

[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.000]
Anzo was the baker's helper Nazarene.

[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.500]
Was the name of the baker?

[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.680]
Yeah, the baker was a...

[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.280]
Nazarene was the one that came in.

[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.020]
His daughter was in love with this guy.

[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.080]
The kid that was going to be deported because you didn't know that was Anzo.

[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.080]
Oh, that was Anzo.

[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.500]
Yeah.

[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.060]
Oh, and Marlon Brando says, give this to a Jew congressman from the Bronx.

[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.000]
Not one of our people.

[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.360]
Remember?

[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.860]
Right.

[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.280]
For him to be a citizen.

[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.580]
To get his green card or whatever it was that time.

[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.160]
Right.

[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.480]
The other thing I was going to say, I also think that I heard Rick Sanchez singing in that Godfather.

[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.960]
This sounded like him in the background.

[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.480]
Could be.

[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.120]
Yeah.

[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.120]
When he slapped him in the face and he said, butch up a little bit.

[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.620]
Exactly.

[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.880]
By the way, Rick Sanchez has a new album coming out.

[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.960]
It's called So Many Pedestrians So Little Time.

[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.200]
It's going to be Big and Halibale.

[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.860]
It'll be a big hit, I think.

[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.220]
You bet.

[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.560]
Yeah.

[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.560]
One other thing I was going to say.

[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.340]
But I've never been able to listen to your program during the day because I teach school.

[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.340]
Isn't this a real tweet?

[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.480]
It sure is.

[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.140]
But I don't know.

[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.980]
I'm one of the tape gang.

[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.240]
Each night I manage to listen to the preceding one hour tape.

[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.360]
Usually 10 to 11 o'clock.

[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.680]
Great.

[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.260]
Well, I put all the good stuff in between 10 and 11.

[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.100]
What you usually do is the introduction to the program.

[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.440]
Right.

[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.340]
It's very enjoyable.

[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.120]
All the four play.

[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.540]
Right.

[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.960]
Could I wish my cousin, Don Michael Barrett.

[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.020]
Don Michael.

[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.900]
Don Michael Barrett, the douchebag.

[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:54.980]
Happy holiday.

[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.500]
Okay.

[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.440]
Thanks a lot, Neil.

[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.160]
Nice job with Camilla now.

[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.540]
Thank you.

[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.900]
Thank you.

[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:07.780]

[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:08.940]
Thank you.

[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.140]
Thank you.

[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.400]
Thank you.

[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.120]
Thank you.

[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.680]
Thank you.

[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:20.880]

[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:22.680]
Thank you.

[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.200]
Thank you.

[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:26.440]

[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:26.440]

[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.020]

[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.020]
Thank you.

[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.520]

[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.520]

[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.520]

[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.520]

[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.520]

[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.520]

[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.520]

[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.520]

[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.520]

[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.520]

[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.520]

[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.520]

[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.520]

[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.520]

[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.520]

[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:58.500]
Thank you.

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.500]

[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.220]
Thank you.

[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.220]

[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.220]

[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.220]

[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.220]

[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.220]

[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.220]

[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.260]
Thank you.

[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:11.360]
Thank you.

[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:11.880]
Thank you.

[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.740]
Thank you.

[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:18.560]
Thank you.

[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:18.720]
Thank you.

[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:18.720]

[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:18.720]

[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.400]
Thank you.

[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:19.520]

[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:19.520]

[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.260]
Thank you.

[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:20.740]
Thank you.

[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:21.420]

[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:21.880]
Thank you.

[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:22.840]
Thank you.

[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:23.660]
Thank you.

[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.040]
Thank you.

[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.320]
Thank you.

[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:25.780]
Thank you.

[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.240]
Thank you.

[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.360]
Thank you.

[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.000]
Thank you.

[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:37.420]
Thank you.

[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:37.500]

[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:37.500]

[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:37.520]

[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:37.520]

[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:37.520]

[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:37.520]

[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:37.520]

[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:37.520]

[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:37.520]

[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:37.520]

[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:37.520]

[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.020]
Have a good one.

[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:39.260]
Yeah.

[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.060]
Well, I don't understand.

[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.440]
I want to get to baseball intensive.

[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.660]
Although it isn't that far off.

[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.600]
It's almost January.

[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.960]
So we only got about a couple of months.

[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.500]
Spring training will be getting underway.

[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.480]
I can't believe it.

[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.220]
Incredible.

[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.840]
A couple of months hurricane baseball beginning started.

[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.580]
No Sam Jankovich.

[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.400]
Boy, is that open up a couple of doors?

[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:57.720]
Huh?

[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.260]
Although Sunny gave me a dirty look this morning.

[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.120]
I don't know what that meant.

[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.540]
Give me that great check for Camilla Sousa on the back.

[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.020]
Was it out?

[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.160]
Keep your nose out of the baseball.

[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.300]
I don't remember when we meant by that.

[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.660]
Now, Sunny is a good guy.

[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.160]
But baseball right around the corner.

[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.360]
What I don't understand though is the cups have made some...

[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.620]
They picked up three free agents.

[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.640]
But what I do not understand is what are they going to do with three catchers?

[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.940]
And with two outstanding catchers.

[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:26.340]
I mean, we've got Hector Villanova who weighs 700 pounds but can hit the ball.

[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.300]
We got Joe Gerardi who I improved dramatically this last year.

[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.800]
And of course, we got Damon Berryhead.

[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:32.420]
Berryhill.

[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.840]
They got to make a trade.

[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.500]
I know a team that desperately needs a good catcher.

[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.560]
I don't want to mention the Metz desperately.

[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.900]
Boy, what they could do with Joe Gerardi, I'm telling you.

[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.180]
Now, we don't want too much.

[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.560]
We'll take good and maybe.

[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.860]
Viola, we don't want.

[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.220]
I guarantee you Viola will not...

[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.040]
But this is my prediction.

[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.660]
Frank Viola will not win 15 games for the Metz this season.

[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.640]
He is garbage.

[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.260]
I know he won all those games and all those...

[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.820]
But they're going to catch you onto him.

[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.220]
He throws balls.

[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.960]
Okay, he doesn't throw strikes.

[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.160]
And if he lay off that crap, all those fork balls,

[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.180]
low and away, way out of the strike zone.

[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.280]
If you just use some patience, man.

[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.200]
This guy gets in serious trouble.

[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.060]
And he's got to bring that fat one in there.

[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.540]
Right in the wheelhouse in Sanberg.

[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.980]
He hits it about 700 yards out of the ballpark.

[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.240]
I was watching the other day, the...

[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.480]
Just out of sheer boredom.

[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.920]
The game against the Giants in Wrigley Field,

[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.300]
where Sanberg hit the home run that they first called fair.

[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.620]
And then they called it a foul ball.

[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.660]
And Zimmer went crazy and got thrown out of the game.

[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.560]
And was kicking dirt on Harry Wendelstad and put on about a 20-minute show.

[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.040]
It was tremendous.

[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.840]
And they kept showing over.

[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.820]
And over the ball was clearly fair.

[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.120]
And the third-based umpire called it right.

[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.960]
And then Wendelstad called a little conference after Roger Craig came bitching and winding.

[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.440]
And a reversed and called it foul.

[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.860]
As it turned out to make any difference because the Cubs won the game.

[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.700]
But it was one of the great argument scenes of the season.

[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.540]
And Zimmer, we may not win the penit,

[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.440]
but at least Zimmer puts on the best show of anybody.

[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.160]
You've got to give him that.

[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.000]
And if you had a steel plate and your head, you'd be uh...

[00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.540]
Serly two.

[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.980]
1242 at WIOD.

[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.080]
I mean, he's no Davey Johnson.

[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.860]
Now look who we have on the phone ladies and gentlemen.

[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.480]
A voice from Christmas past.

[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.480]
White at day.

[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.900]
I feel just like Ebenezer's Scrooge in the heat.

[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.440]
White at day.

[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:11.980]
Yeah.

[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:12.760]
You uh...

[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.880]
Catched the Johnny Depp report and names and faces in the Sentinel?

[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:16.380]
No.

[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.380]
I sure did.

[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.140]
Well, he talks about his worst nightmare.

[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:21.780]
Yeah.

[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.500]
It's being chased by the skipper Alan Hall Jr. from Gilligan's Island.

[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.980]
And he's chasing me and chasing me and he's in his bathrobe.

[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.160]
And I jump over a set of bushes and he jumps on top of me.

[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.500]
And then I wake up.

[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.100]
What?

[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.240]
And then it turns out it's not a dream, right?

[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.600]
Wow, Johnny.

[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.060]
All in the interhairs.

[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.800]
Yeah, look out for Old Scissorhead.

[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.820]
He went Bobby O'Heeder.

[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.020]
What a team they would make him.

[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:50.820]
Talk about chasing.

[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:51.460]
Yeah.

[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:53.840]
Well, listen, I call him.

[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.580]
He could be the governor of Rhode Island again.

[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.640]
I call him my mom.

[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:56.820]
I call him my mom.

[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.380]
Jack and Chafee.

[00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.600]
Wasn't that his name?

[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:00.780]
Wasn't he governor of Rhode Island?

[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:01.420]
Come on.

[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.040]
You're not as sharp as you're supposed to be on Christmas Eve Day.

[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:04.940]
Governor Who?

[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.240]
I don't know.

[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.260]
Governor Corleone.

[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.740]
Senator Corleone.

[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.540]
Well, I call him my mom.

[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.720]
Another president of auntie.

[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.260]
I call Grandma Lena Sestin, Palermo Sistalis this morning,

[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.820]
to assure Mary Christmas.

[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.300]
And let me tell you, she's real pissed off about the opening tomorrow.

[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.120]
Real pissed off.

[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.960]
She said the enemy scene is not accurate.

[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.060]
There's one thing about the same grandma.

[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.560]
It was real big on Antibas.

[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.520]
I don't know what the deal was.

[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.500]
But on the Jewish grandma, there's our experts,

[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:38.940]
high-colonics, animals.

[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.900]
They're sloganists.

[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:41.580]
It's in the bag.

[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.840]
Well, there's supposed to be one of those types of scenes in the movie.

[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.340]
So there'd be something to look at.

[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:47.960]
Is there really?

[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:48.720]
I don't know.

[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.040]
Grandma Sestita tells me that.

[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.160]
So we'll find out.

[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.760]
Anyway, listen, I want to wish Stan and Laurie and the kids of Mary Christmas

[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.880]
and happy holidays and the same to you.

[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.980]
And everybody stay safe.

[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:02.920]
Good day.

[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:03.600]
Good day.

[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.480]
See, I thought I was kidding when I said we were going to play this over.

[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.540]
And it's not getting old yet either.

[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.720]
Just kind of warming up to it now.

[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.380]
Okay, let's take a call from Sandy and Kendall.

[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.200]
Hi, Neil.

[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.800]
The lovely, the voluptuous, the brilliant, the incredible, the tacky Sandy.

[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:22.680]
How are you?

[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:23.640]
I'm doing okay.

[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.420]
Happy Hanukkah.

[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.180]
How was your thing so far?

[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.720]
My thing's been good so far, but I need a little motivation.

[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.140]
I've got to buy...

[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.500]
Well, this is your motivation station?

[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.140]
That's why I said before I leave the house, which I can't do.

[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:35.920]
I'm not the bike.

[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.240]
Before I'm more Christmas present.

[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.880]
And I just can't do it.

[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.800]
I just have no motivation to do it.

[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.240]
You know another great scene?

[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.120]
Remember what Tom Hagen was out there shopping for Christmas presents?

[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:49.740]
No.

[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.220]
And Salotto and his men pulled him over.

[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.440]
They said we want to talk and they shoved him into the car.

[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.400]
Oh, yeah, yeah.

[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.820]
And then Marlon Branda was out there buying that fruit.

[00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.480]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.760]
How about when the scene was going to be...

[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.780]
It goes to show you, Marlon.

[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.340]
Keep your hands off the fruit, baby.

[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.480]
When Michael and Fredo are in Cuba and it's new years.

[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.020]
Oh, yeah.

[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.020]
And he finds out the best scene when he gives them that big kiss.

[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.440]
When he gives them that big kiss and he says, I know it was...

[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.860]
I know it was you, Fredo.

[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.700]
You broke my heart.

[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.480]
You broke my heart.

[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.680]
What a great scene.

[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:19.860]
And the other thing...

[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.360]
And if I don't see you, I'm going to die.

[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.900]
And the other scene is when Diane Pete tells him she had the abortion.

[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.760]
That's another good scene.

[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.180]
It was a boy, Michael.

[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.180]
It was a boy.

[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.760]
Yeah, and I had it aborted.

[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.660]
It was in a...

[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.840]
In just like our marriage.

[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:33.240]
Yeah.

[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.500]
You know, that was a good one.

[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:35.640]
Was that my other line?

[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:36.440]
No.

[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:37.180]
Oh, okay.

[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.120]
Now it was just probably the CIA tap.

[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.400]
You know the mob there in the CIA.

[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.100]
They're everywhere.

[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:41.680]
I know.

[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.320]
It is my other line.

[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.140]
I know these people.

[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:44.860]
You don't want it.

[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:45.220]
I know.

[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.440]
Probably some opinion he asked me where the family looking for something for the home.

[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.280]
No, long-lost friend.

[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.520]
We haven't heard from all year.

[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.020]
Now if I answer the phone, I got to buy them for Christmas present.

[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:52.500]
Oh, speak.

[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.560]
Can I tell you a little story because I feel like I know you.

[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.120]
Okay.

[00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:02.500]
Now months ago, months ago on this show, I mentioned the fact that I went to college with a

[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:02.780]
sir...

[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.000]
I don't want to mention his name because it would be in Porteis, with a certain person from Philadelphia.

[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:07.660]
Uh-huh.

[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.700]
And somebody called in because I was telling a funny story about how he couldn't handle his

[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.980]
beer and he puked all over the hall and he swept up and down the hallway and we were...

[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.220]
Our shoes were getting stuck and all.

[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.320]
Well anyway, to make a long story short, somebody called in and they knew him.

[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.120]
And he's written these books and he's bapapapipa and all this other.

[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.500]
So, he called me.

[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.320]
In other words, uh...

[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.660]
He gave him my number and we got in touch and he started calling me.

[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.120]
And you never said his name on the air?

[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:35.460]
Yes, I have.

[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:35.640]
Oh, you know.

[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.620]
But I'm not going to mention it now.

[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.100]
Okay, okay.

[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.960]
But to make a long story short, the guy has had a rough life and he's been through drugs.

[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.040]
It's a real messy divorce and just his mind is like Marshmallows.

[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.120]
And he calls me...

[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.320]
What would they...

[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.220]
I'm sitting there watching...

[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.040]
Who knows what?

[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.580]
And he calls me out of the blue.

[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.300]
In fact, it was just before I was getting ready to go to the track and he calls me up.

[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.180]
And he said, I don't know what they...

[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.140]
I didn't make any sense and he said,

[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.460]
Do you...

[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.940]
I'm sure you know what, I'm calling.

[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.660]
I need to get a...

[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.180]
Can you help me with a couple of tickets?

[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.620]
And you know what he...

[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.060]
Oh, he started with a story about how he was leaving the house to go to a wedding.

[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:20.060]
And his best friend, whose white, is getting married to a black woman and the fam...

[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:26.900]
I mean, all this pseudo-socialogical and do I know where he can put up a couple of well-behave kids for the night?

[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.120]
And he's calling me. He's in Philadelphia. He's not here.

[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.040]
That's incredible.

[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.620]
And I'm going to tell you, I have no idea what he was talking about.

[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.800]
And it was so scary because he was...

[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.000]
Probably had a few too many before he called you.

[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.560]
He made no sense at all.

[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.100]
I mean, I think he was swallowing perkadan by the bottle for something.

[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.680]
I don't know what it was, but...

[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.160]
I just love those unexpected phones for people you haven't heard from.

[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.140]
Yeah, and I don't know what his story is.

[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.440]
I mean, he's into like wooden mushrooms or something.

[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.500]
I don't know what the deal is, but his e-mails are.

[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.300]
You don't know.

[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.220]
You know, and it's too late.

[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.160]
I mean, like his whole life went by and he's got his thing and I'm doing mine.

[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.400]
And I just... I don't need to know.

[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.620]
I mean, it doesn't fit anymore.

[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:01.960]
It doesn't fit anymore.

[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:02.740]
It's okay to...

[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:03.340]
It's okay to...

[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:03.620]
It's okay to...

[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:03.620]

[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:03.620]

[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:03.620]

[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:03.620]

[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:03.940]
It's okay to...

[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.100]
It's okay to...

[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:11.680]
It's okay to...

[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.320]
I mean, I've been in the film in 30 years and now it's turned into like a human walking vegetable.

[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.640]
You know, I can't deal with it.

[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.640]
I know what you're saying.

[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.560]
Oh, it was strange.

[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.540]
What did you think of such Christmas present?

[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.260]
What was that?

[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.780]
He's going to be a daddy.

[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.280]
Oh, you know, is that for real or is that a joke?

[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.500]
He's being real-frighted.

[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:28.900]
Oh, my God.

[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:29.600]
He's getting here.

[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:30.200]
I called him out.

[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.420]
Oh, I heard Rick...

[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.220]
Rick was on his way to the airport.

[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.420]
Doug was alone from 530 to 6, and I called him.

[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.080]
And I was the first to give him my sympathy because everybody was congratulating him.

[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.300]
And it was...

[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.080]
It was a definite yes.

[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:44.640]
Oh!

[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.900]
So, Rick is going to rip him.

[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:48.560]
Oh.

[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.960]
And what is it Wednesday?

[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.560]
I can't get over it.

[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.140]
How about he can?

[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:52.640]
It's a definitely yes.

[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.200]
I mean, he's an old guy.

[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.200]
He's in total shock.

[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:56.560]
It was his family.

[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.900]
Can you imagine that when his kid is about like eight years old and going to school?

[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:01.300]
It's going to be a big day.

[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.320]
And they say, well, what your...

[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.120]
Does your daddy do?

[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.880]
And they say, oh, he's in a nursing home performer broadcasters?

[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:06.740]
Oh, God.

[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.400]
For a son.

[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.080]
He's in with vegetables.

[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:10.840]
They say, what do you mean?

[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.860]
He's in a produce business.

[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.940]
No, he's in a nursing home with a bunch of vegetables.

[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:14.320]
Yeah.

[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.980]
Did you listen to Larry King, the Saudi Arabia show?

[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.160]
What did they stick him in the desert?

[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:19.620]
No.

[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:25.260]
You didn't hear when they projected life to Saudi Arabia through the Army broadcasting and the mutual.

[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.200]
They had it set up.

[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.240]
So for like three hours, like the family would call in.

[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.720]
And it was being heard all over the country.

[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.840]
Oh, and another one of those deals.

[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:33.540]
No, I didn't hear it.

[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.120]
The first time I heard the man show...

[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.600]
The deal brought this kind of show and say dirty words.

[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:44.140]
That kind of broadcasting has appealed to a certain element that I do not desire to appeal to.

[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:44.880]
And you don't?

[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:45.880]
Is that a recent cart?

[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:46.580]
Yeah.

[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:47.780]
I don't know.

[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:48.700]
I guess so.

[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.240]
Yeah, about a week ago, Manny, who worked so overnight with that.

[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.840]
Well, he actually cried on the radio during the show.

[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.140]
I couldn't believe it.

[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:57.820]
Well, you know why?

[00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:58.280]
Why?

[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.480]
The makeup mirror in front of him, because it was being televised on C-SPAN.

[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.820]
And we looked in the mirror, he stayed, broke down, he couldn't handle it.

[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.540]
He was practicing his acting skill, huh?

[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.480]
No, he saw his image.

[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:08.740]
Well, that'll do it.

[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.940]
That'll definitely do it.

[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.040]
Neil, before I go, who's going to the Super Bowl?

[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.460]
I haven't heard you say who's going.

[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.920]
Dolphins and 49ers.

[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:17.300]
All right.

[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.360]
How's that for confidence?

[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:18.820]
Good.

[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.500]
And now ask me if I believe it.

[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:20.900]
I like that.

[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.900]
Well, listen, once the playoffs start, you never know.

[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.020]
Okay, let's hope for the best.

[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:24.880]
And you know what?

[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.980]
And then maybe Joe Montana will get the kidnab by Lou Holtz,

[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.940]
and they'll go off and get married in Ireland or something.

[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.640]
And we might have a chance against Steve Young, you never know.

[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.760]
You know what?

[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.620]
On your tape, I never did tell you, but my favorite song on your tape

[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.540]
is the Ballad of Neil.

[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.440]
I love it.

[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:40.620]
And I just want to let you know.

[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.380]
The Ballad of Neil?

[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.240]
The Ballad of Neil.

[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:42.780]
Neil's Ballad of Neil.

[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.700]
Oh, that thing, yeah.

[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.260]
I love that.

[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.260]
The Resolution of Neil.

[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:45.680]
That's it.

[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.440]
Whatever the hell it is.

[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.180]
The Ballad of Neil.

[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.260]
Well, I might even play it now.

[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:48.820]
You should.

[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:49.540]
I love it.

[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:49.980]
Okay.

[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:50.520]
All right.

[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.580]
We're going to have a great New Year.

[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.560]
Your Bobby, a big kiss for all of us, okay?

[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:53.740]
I will.

[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.640]
And have a great time.

[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.080]
You too.

[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:55.480]
Bye.

[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.180]
That's Old Sandy from Kendall.

[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.320]
It's a 12.51 at WIOD.

[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.840]
We have an open line in Dade County.

[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.600]
We're not doing too bad for a holiday today.

[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.040]
I can't believe it.

[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.580]
I thought everybody would be like sitting around the fireplace,

[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.420]
roasting their chestnuts, checking out their acorns.

[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.820]
Anyway, if you're wanting to...

[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.440]
Let's get with it.

[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.060]
Well, listen to that cart rattle.

[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:17.820]
Isn't that good?

[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.140]
751 WIOD.

[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.460]
Let's go to Peppy.

[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:22.240]
Hello.

[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.440]
How are you, Peppy?

[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.140]
All right.

[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.400]
Listen up.

[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.140]
I tell you why I called.

[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:26.700]
Yes.

[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.120]
I've listened to you for many, many years.

[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.200]
Seems like a lifetime.

[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:30.940]
So, yeah.

[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.760]
But many times I've been very upset, very angry.

[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:35.940]
About what?

[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.400]
About things that you say about the elderly people,

[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:39.900]
and how you say it.

[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.880]
But let me get to the point.

[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.920]
I'm calling you because I'm calling you to praise you.

[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.260]
I can't get over the fact what you're doing for Camilla South.

[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.520]
I happen to be a fundraiser myself.

[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.960]
I find it so hard to raise even a thousand dollars for courses.

[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:58.440]
I know.

[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.080]
But what you did, for the courses you did,

[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.500]
all my anger, all my being upset as a raised away,

[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.500]
I just think you are marvelous,

[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.000]
and I would like to give you a donation of $50.

[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.160]
Thank you, Peppy.

[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:12.760]
That's great.

[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.180]
And I really...

[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.760]
I just cannot get over it.

[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.460]
I'm amazed how they had to do this.

[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.660]
Approved by the following you have,

[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.080]
and in the long run, you're a nice guy.

[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:23.980]
How about that?

[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:24.360]
Okay.

[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.300]
Thank you, Peppy.

[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:25.720]
All right.

[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.360]
I'll send the $50.

[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:32.000]
I'll tell you why I'm doing it really because very recently,

[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.660]
I had a luncheon of the needy people,

[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.720]
and I omitted the Camilla South,

[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.700]
so this is my chance to make it up through you.

[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.780]
Great. Never too late.

[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:41.920]
Okay. Thanks, Peppy.

[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.660]
Good work. I just can't get over it.

[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.280]
Bye-bye.

[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.540]
12.56 at WIOD.

[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.740]
By the way, did we miss BuDells?

[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.300]
Checked that coming while I was on vacation,

[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.820]
because I know as soon as I came back,

[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.080]
I had a big check from Ricky Tiki for a couple of hundred.

[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.300]
I want to say it again, sunny hers came through with a big check,

[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.920]
250 this morning, super, just like he did last year.

[00:21:59.220 --> 00:21:59.760]
Great guy.

[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.680]
Hank Goldberg gave me a big check.

[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.280]
So there's some people conspicuous by their absence, right?

[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.280]
What about Tanner and Cox over there at Power 96,

[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.900]
who every never fail, every year come through big time?

[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:12.760]
What happened this year?

[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.680]
Time stuff over there?

[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.160]
They dying over there?

[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.940]
Let's go to a Pompo-no.

[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.740]
Paulie sold out the old man.

[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.940]
That's through it.

[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:22.180]
Yeah.

[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.480]
Hey, listen, have a call.

[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:23.640]

[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:24.760]
Paulie.

[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.080]
Paulie.

[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.780]
You know what the end of the...

[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.160]
Paulie won't see him no more.

[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.220]
You know what the end of the second movie they show the scene

[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.340]
where Michael tells me and rolled in the army?

[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:35.500]
Yeah.

[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:36.640]
Well, let me ask you something,

[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.260]
because I didn't see that making of the movie.

[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.500]
Was that filmed during the first movie

[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.820]
or did they bring it back like James Conn and those people

[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.180]
during the filming of the second movie?

[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.100]
How did they do that?

[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.060]
Ah.

[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.620]
They didn't make that clear.

[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:51.800]
It must have brought them back.

[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:52.340]
You think?

[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.060]
Oh, I would think.

[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.400]
Because it looks like it might have been filmed

[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.360]
at the beginning of the first movie they just never used.

[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.140]
Oh, well, that's true.

[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:57.800]
It could have been footage.

[00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:58.260]
You're right.

[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.220]
That's true, because there's two of them

[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:00.960]
whatever they want with.

[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.380]
You know, the interesting thing in that HBO special,

[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.680]
they're talking about Michael.

[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.820]
You know, in the first movie when they come to the wedding,

[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.200]
you know, and he's sitting there with Cain,

[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.120]
he's wearing his military outfit, whatever it is.

[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.520]
And in the...

[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.120]
These clips that they're showing,

[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.880]
they must have been when they were all auditioning.

[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.800]
And he's wearing about two or three different uniforms,

[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.920]
none of which are the ones that he wore in a real movie.

[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.620]
But it's some of them are like comically looks ridiculous.

[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.360]
What is that show going to be on again?

[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.360]
I don't know.

[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.880]
You have to look in the TV book.

[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.620]
It's on HBO.

[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.480]
And it's really, it's an hour special.

[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.360]
And it's funny.

[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.000]
The outtakes are hysterical.

[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.540]
I mean, just...

[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.140]
There was one part where they kept telling Al Pacino

[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.180]
that he's going to laugh.

[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.220]
Before they started filming,

[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.080]
they said, you're going to laugh no matter what you do.

[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:46.620]
And they did.

[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.000]
They all could do ball and James Conner.

[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]
All seen there just puking their brains out,

[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.520]
laughing over and over again.

[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.600]
It's hysterical.

[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.760]
I have another question for you.

[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:55.040]

[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.160]
I've seen the second one about maybe three times.

[00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:58.480]
Yeah.

[00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.400]
I'm still confused.

[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.560]
Who tries to kill him in his bedroom?

[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.640]
Is it Pantangely or is it the Jewel Miami?

[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.240]
Oh, yeah, it's Marlansky.

[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:07.920]
My hymen law.

[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:08.500]
I'm sorry.

[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:09.680]
I say Marlansky.

[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:10.380]
My hymen law.

[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.080]
Same difference.

[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:11.500]
Yeah.

[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.160]
Frato sold him out.

[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:14.340]
Right.

[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.800]
And Michael doesn't even...

[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.040]
Isn't really sure until Frato says that in the bar in Cuba.

[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:19.560]
Right.

[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:20.400]
Yeah.

[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.100]
You got to admit the second movie is pretty confusing.

[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:23.580]
Yeah.

[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.460]
You got to see it about a hundred times before you understand.

[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.680]
That's the idea. That's why we've all watched it a hundred times

[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.720]
because we're still trying to figure out what the message is.

[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.340]
Exactly right.

[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:30.900]
Okay.

[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:31.440]
All right.

[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.280]
Oscar Manion.

[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:32.700]
Thank you.

[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.560]
Well, kind of a little defensive part of the music now.

[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.460]
And I think this is a perfect time for us to lead

[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.960]
into our Pensive 1 o'clock WIOD news.

[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.620]
But the very Pensive and Area Knight, Elaine Etor, who's standing by

[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.920]
to bring it the latest and the greatest and the greatest.

[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.220]
And then we'll come back with our gigantic one to two hours.

[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:51.120]
Don't miss that.

[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.140]
Two o'clock this afternoon we have a radio history in the making.

[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.880]
The Daddy to Be.

[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:56.800]
Suds and Rick.

[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.840]
Boy, that is incredible.

[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.720]
Are they going to have stilts for that baby or what?

[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.080]
Rick ensuds the best stuff from two to six.

[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.020]
We got a brief, a dolphin...

[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.640]
What is there to say?

[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.320]
A recap on 605 and then we got Christmas music, of course.

[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.560]
Okay, one on nine at WIOD.

[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.500]
Let's go right back to these exciting calls.

[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.500]
Oh, is we going to have a bummer on the first call of the hour?

[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:22.060]
Surfside.

[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:22.500]
Hey, now.

[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:23.020]
Yeah.

[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.640]
Well, that's not your place sometimes.

[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.340]
That little piece from the Parkage family.

[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:27.980]
It'd be happy.

[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:28.280]
Something.

[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.320]
What's the exact title that's on?

[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.840]
Come on, get happy.

[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:31.480]
Come on, get happy.

[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.420]
Is that a nice show of 45?

[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:33.680]
Was it what?

[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:34.160]
A 45?

[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:34.760]
Yeah.

[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.160]
Okay, just wanted to find someone trying to get a habit of seeing it.

[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:37.520]
Okay.

[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.360]
Okay, let's see.

[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.320]
Oh, I thought it was going to be Eli Turgerman.

[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:41.560]
See, I'm very nervous.

[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:45.360]
Any time we get a call from Surfside because Surfside is basically a bunch of douchebags.

[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:50.560]
We have an open line of dates, 751 and one on a starline for our bell-soft buddies.

[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:54.500]
Our pals are slime balls star I-O-D.

[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:55.720]
Four-lotterdale.

[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:56.880]
Hey, Paison.

[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:57.960]
Yeah, Paison.

[00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:58.680]
What's the happen?

[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.740]
Hey, you making me wait so long, my ears.

[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:01.460]
You go to sleep.

[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.620]
Well, that's a good.

[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:03.360]
Give you some rest.

[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.580]
Hey, listen to part three.

[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.760]
It's a Godfather meet a proper to proper, yeah?

[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:07.360]
Yeah.

[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.740]
Hey, listen to that too.

[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.340]
Mya Lasky wasn't talking about a whole friend.

[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:11.960]
He's hiding a rock.

[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.420]
Could you use your hymena rock?

[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.000]
Yeah, mya, hymena.

[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.480]
He had a dream about a pasta.

[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.120]
Solid hemas.

[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.160]
I want to make a big city out in the desert, but something happened to him.

[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.020]
Tell me what happened.

[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:23.900]
Mo Green.

[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:24.880]
And what happened?

[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.320]
He went from a size.

[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.080]
Have a good time and tomorrow, Neil.

[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:28.660]
Okay.

[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.160]
I'll be off.

[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:35.860]
Okay.

[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.000]
It's 11 a.m.

[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:40.180]
What?

[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:40.740]
I'll tell you.

[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.480]
They're going to be lined up for blocks tomorrow, even though it's going to be thank goodness.

[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.800]
It's on Christmas day, right?

[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.160]
Early, they'll all be eaten, right?

[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.340]
There won't be anybody in the movie at the early.

[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:49.600]
Huh?

[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:50.780]
Now, they'll all be eaten.

[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:56.400]
They'll be stuffing their faces with turkey and ham and pala vaude.

[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.840]
Yeah, they'll be stuffing oranges, oranges, oranges, oranges, peels in their mouth.

[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.660]
Chasing little kids around in the flower garden.

[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.720]
Did I punch up line four by mistake in Pemberpine?

[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:10.380]
Hey, Neil.

[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:11.760]
How are you, guy?

[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:12.440]
Okay.

[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.420]
Listen, I got a good store for you here.

[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.760]
Okay, we can find one.

[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.100]
This one.

[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.200]
Remember, I told you in about all month and a half, like I told you, over Miami.

[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.920]
And the guy, the cop, is all pissed off about.

[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:23.860]
No, you don't want to be.

[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:24.980]
Listener, this guy.

[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:25.900]
Yeah.

[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.620]
Back to your other car and all the other crap.

[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.160]
Uh-huh.

[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.220]
So I got off from the judge the other day.

[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.480]
I got my Neil shirt on.

[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.880]
And once he got your remote, I'll print this back in the phone, right?

[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:34.640]
Yeah.

[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:39.020]
I bought myself 10 tapes for Christmas presents, which are going to make real good Christmas presents.

[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:39.400]
Right.

[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.400]
So I'll stand in there.

[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.020]
And the judge turns out to be a Nelly.

[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:44.500]
Wow.

[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.160]
He's heard of James.

[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.140]
And listen to you whenever he gets a chance.

[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:48.880]
There's the else.

[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.040]
I'll explain my case to the guy, right?

[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:51.980]
I told him I said, look.

[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.260]
I ran the yellow line.

[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.000]
It is my fault.

[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.220]
Well, you know, we got all the judges in our pockets, you know.

[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:56.880]
Damn, right.

[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.660]
I told him I said, you know, I'm not trying to beat the case.

[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.280]
I did run the yellow line right back to it.

[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.540]
But you know, this guy is not after professional at all.

[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.940]
I said, the guy said, Nelly, to rap to me, telling me that he did know.

[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.040]
I'm offended him because my radio is on.

[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.140]
And he don't like listening to this Neil Rogers guy and all this other crap.

[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.240]
And I got my Neil shirt on.

[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.320]
So the judge turned around and did.

[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.880]
Through the case, I told him I said, look, I said this guy.

[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.440]
He said, to spend the descendants.

[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:21.880]
I said, spend the descendants.

[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.480]
He said, he turned around.

[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:29.140]
And I said, look, I said, this guy Neil Rogers, I feel like I'm the only guy in the city right here that's doing stuff for the people who ain't gotten nothing to eat.

[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.680]
People who ain't got no place to sleep.

[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.400]
This Camilla House project, the guy's got almost $100,000.

[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.100]
I contributed $200 in my own money to buy taste for Christmas presents.

[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.200]
If I turn around and said you paid your, you're just due right there.

[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:40.900]
There you go.

[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:41.480]
What a judge.

[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.080]
Hey, that son.

[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.380]
Hey, listen, you know that guy in light, lady?

[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:44.560]

[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.220]
Wolf, where's she the fox, huh?

[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:46.460]
Who?

[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.060]
The guy in light, lady.

[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.640]
The one that gives you your updates on the guy in light.

[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.260]
Did I meet her?

[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:57.800]
Oh, she found her, uh, she found your photograph on her, uh, on your picture out the remote.

[00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.860]
The guy in light, lady.

[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.160]
You mean the not-slanding lady?

[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.580]
No, the guy in light, lady.

[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:03.620]
The guy in light, lady.

[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:03.740]
The guy in light, lady.

[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.700]
Yeah, you remember, she only caused one short flight.

[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.980]
I mean, she got long black hair.

[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.260]
I'm gonna sit right next to a pink with fine kids.

[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.380]
Did she tell me she was the guy in light, lady?

[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.260]
I think she did.

[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.400]
In fact, she said she was gonna take the shows for you when you couldn't see him.

[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:17.600]
You remember that?

[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.380]
I said, back in the middle of house going on.

[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.440]
Okay, have a good one, pal.

[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.360]
Thanks.

[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.440]
114 to W.I.

[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:27.740]
If Don Corleone had all the politicians and the judges in his pocket, he should share, right?

[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.520]
He must share.

[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.420]
Naturally, he can present a bill for a services because, after all, we're not communists.

[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.680]
Who is that actor that played the Don Barzini?

[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.400]
What is his name?

[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:39.860]
Very well-known actor.

[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.200]
Oh, now, so, now there's a good trivia question.

[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:49.160]
Is Chuck Meyer-Listing dead or alive for that actor who played Don Barzini?

[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.180]
He's not, he wasn't like somebody obscure.

[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.460]
He's a very...

[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.180]
Oh, geez.

[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.160]
I mean, we got far enough with Don Tomasino.

[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:57.900]
You got it already?

[00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:58.980]
No, we don't have it yet.

[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.340]
Okay, and if we ever get Line 5 picked, somebody could have called in on Line 5 and Broward

[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.460]
with the answer to the question.

[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.080]
Oh, gee, there's a B in the name.

[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:06.780]
Who's with a B?

[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.340]
Get Mickey Dane on the phone right away.

[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:08.980]
Who's with a B?

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.520]
In 19, at W.I.

[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.400]
They were just seven-oat.

[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:12.800]
But went by pretty fast today.

[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.480]
I'll tell you that.

[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.640]
It is really zoomed by 87,000, 843,

[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.320]
our Camille House total plus.

[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.320]
Who knows how much in-house somewhere.

[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.940]
I mean, T.C., you must have a lock in the closet, all the mail from Friday.

[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.920]
And then there's a whole bunch from Saturday and today and no mail tomorrow.

[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.120]
So Wednesday, we ought to have a flood.

[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.320]
Even Noah would be impressed by...

[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:38.040]
Even Yonic Noah would be impressed by what we're going to open up on Wednesday in the mail, too.

[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.900]
So we should be over 90,000 easy.

[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:45.720]
In fact, by the end of this week, we'd be up there 95, maybe pressing that $100,000 mark.

[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.580]
I think next week is the week we go over.

[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.520]
And of course, a week from this Friday, in a week and a half, on the 4th of January,

[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.260]
we'll be doing our next remote at Calder Race Course.

[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.400]
We'll be doing our whole show there live from 10 to 2.

[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.460]
Bring your money, plunge your brains out, and to bring some for Camille House 2.

[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:03.620]
Del Ray Beach.

[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.520]
Hello, Neil.

[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.120]
We have a little present here.

[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.860]
From President Bush.

[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.440]
Okay, that's his second call.

[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.640]
Remember the first, like the first two or three minutes?

[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.860]
Okay, have a great day, pal.

[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:19.000]
And stick your record with the Mondo and Shine.

[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:20.620]
Miami Shores.

[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:21.480]
Hey, Neil.

[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.080]
How you doing?

[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:22.820]
I'm doing fine.

[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:23.400]
How you doing?

[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:23.980]
Excellent.

[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.180]
Listen, did you, I know you loved the Godfather movies.

[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:27.960]
Did you ever read the book?

[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.940]
Yeah, the book was better on movies.

[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:30.480]
Oh, great.

[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.580]
But the movie was one of the closest movies to a book I've ever seen.

[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:35.020]
Yeah.

[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.620]
The book is always better.

[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.620]
Yeah, I want to read high treason.

[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.420]
Boy, you're really ought to.

[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:44.260]
But, see, I'm like 35 years old when I'm 36.

[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:48.900]
And 20 years ago, I figured out that Nixon was like basically behind the whole thing.

[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.800]
Can't stand that, man.

[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.300]
You have two cards.

[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.140]
You have to pick one out for me.

[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.380]
I'm trying to quit smoking.

[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:01.220]
One of your front-age cards that haven't heard since a long time is like the band that's playing smoke until you choke.

[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.240]
Yeah.

[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.100]
That's hysterical.

[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:08.680]
That and the one with a guy with, you just played the guy with the bandit, the person or the room.

[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.100]
The one you just played a few minutes ago.

[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:12.920]
Yeah, the guy's brother.

[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:13.260]
Yeah.

[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.460]
Okay, that's the one with.

[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.480]
By the guy with a jail and all that, which is hysterical.

[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.940]
Yeah, just played that last week.

[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:19.440]
Oh, it did.

[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:20.160]
That's Dick Prick.

[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.800]
And another thing, I'm real sorry about Bill Paulder.

[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:24.220]
Yeah.

[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.780]
My wife used to work at the station there.

[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.000]
She says he's one of the nicest guys she ever met.

[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:28.380]
Sure was.

[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.660]
And we're missing.

[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.800]
And you have a happy Chanooka and all the other stuff.

[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.240]
But if you can get one of those cards, either one, I'd really appreciate it.

[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.220]
And have a good day off tomorrow and we'll listen to you Wednesday.

[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.120]
Okay, have a good night.

[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.080]
Okay, 122, no chance.

[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.720]
We have an open line in Dave County, 7519463.

[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.180]
We'll go to North Miami.

[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:49.280]
Mo Green lives.

[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:50.040]
Yeah.

[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.960]
I don't think Mo's going back there for a rub down.

[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.360]
That's right.

[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.300]
I think I really had to save you.

[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:55.960]
Okay.

[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:56.780]
Bye-bye.

[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:57.180]
See you.

[00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:58.440]
Well, it was, it was appropriate.

[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.420]
Ah, is this audience on top of things or what?

[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.840]
Richard Coday played Don Barzina.

[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.000]
Richard Coday's like, you know, big time actor.

[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:09.980]
He's been around a long time.

[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.400]
Character actor.

[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.180]
Very good.

[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.220]
And fit that role perfectly.

[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:20.500]
And also the old guy who played the guy with the horse's head, the Hollywood producer.

[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:22.020]
He's another one.

[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.160]
Character actor been around.

[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.220]
Everybody and their brother was in that movie.

[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.300]
And that's the point they made in that HBO special.

[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.400]
And making Godfather 1, 2 and 3 is that just about everybody in the world.

[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.440]
It came in audition for those parts.

[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.840]
Everybody was, you know, the one thing I'm not hearing anything about and maybe just as well.

[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:48.640]
One of the only person I see in Godfather 3 other than Coppola's daughter, who makes no sense at all, is George Hamilton IV.

[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.780]
I cannot stand George Hamilton IV.

[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.340]
The sight of him makes me nauseous.

[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.840]
He is just something about him.

[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.000]
He's halosious, okay?

[00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.780]
And they couldn't get the Robert Duvall because he wanted too much money.

[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.200]
He wanted a 3.5 million or something.

[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:07.380]
They didn't want to cough up the money because Coppola's daughter needed the bucks and his father and the whole family.

[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.280]
So they bring in George Hamilton IV to be the new family lawyer.

[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.280]
And I just can't see it.

[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.680]
I just can't not envision it, okay?

[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.220]
Unless they got a bag over it.

[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.380]
Maybe he'll be the bag man.

[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.860]
Starline and Broward.

[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:22.380]
Yeah, that me.

[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.280]
That's you.

[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.040]
Oh, hey.

[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.760]
Um, am I on the air or what?

[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:27.840]
It sure sounds like it.

[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:28.360]
Oh, hey.

[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.300]
That's my first time on a call.

[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:31.340]
Incredible.

[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.400]
How was it so far?

[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:33.700]
Pretty good.

[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:34.740]
Pretty exciting?

[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:35.800]
Yeah.

[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:40.180]
We're on high 95 coming down from E-Ha Junction.

[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.600]
Yeah, how the E-Ha is doing?

[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:42.460]
Yahoo's.

[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:43.680]
Very, very good.

[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:44.880]
Pretty boring.

[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.520]
You know, I call if I'm supposed to get.

[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:48.240]
Yeah.

[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.800]
Yeah, I'm from Orlando and we just drove to that earlier.

[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.800]
This morning, that's going to be hell when it gets down here.

[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.960]
Nah, it's going to be like 73 tomorrow and it's going to be back up in the mid-70s and

[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.740]
then by the end of the week up in the 80s again.

[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.240]
Well, it's pretty miserable in the rain.

[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.180]
Up there.

[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.220]
Yeah, that's Orlando.

[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.780]
It's a Mickey Mouse town pal.

[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:05.560]
Yeah, Mickey Mouse.

[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.540]
It's a Yahoo place.

[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.100]
A bunch of red necks in the douchebags up there.

[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.060]
Yeah, you got that right.

[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.180]
A bunch of orange pickers.

[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.680]
Yeah, I'm a native of the town Miami.

[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:13.860]
Now you're talking.

[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.760]
You were here when it was the real place.

[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:16.300]
Yeah.

[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.080]
Well, listen, have a great holiday.

[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:19.780]
How are you, too?

[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:20.220]
Okay.

[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:21.940]
Hey, listen, that's it.

[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.220]
124 at WIOD.

[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.660]
We have an open line on the star line.

[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:26.540]
It's star IOD.

[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.800]
I should recap some of the stuff I mentioned at the beginning of the show because it's a holiday

[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.580]
and people are busy.

[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.620]
They're busy doing stuff.

[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.360]
Okay, they have a life today for a few days.

[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.700]
This is the one time of the year when many people have a semblance of a life.

[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.260]
Not much, but a little bit.

[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.620]
And our horse at Pompoonopark, our WIOD Stable Horse Christmas list.

[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:48.980]
Great race Thursday with Vilfe driving Camino a second, just barely beaten second.

[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:54.580]
It has made almost, let's see, made 4,500 and 1,257, 150 bucks in just three starts.

[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.840]
We had 700 people who showed up Thursday with their passes.

[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.480]
So they're still 700 alive to assure that Jack, Jackpot at the end of April.

[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:06.320]
And I think this coming Sunday, next Sunday, which is the last Sunday that we're racing at Pompoonopark,

[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.220]
who is going to be his next star.

[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.320]
But I'll let you know toward the end of the week for sure.

[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.480]
And we told you the Camino's house total.

[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.120]
It seems to me like I'm forgetting something.

[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.260]
Like, and suds is going to be a father.

[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:20.280]
That just knocks me off my ass. I can't believe that.

[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.600]
God, just a little bit of caution.

[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.520]
Let's go to a lady in plantation.

[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:27.800]
Bonestata.

[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:28.720]
I had.

[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:29.460]
Bonestata.

[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:30.340]
Bonestata.

[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.260]
That was John Morley that played.

[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.800]
The Hollywood producer, right?

[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.340]
And who's dead as a door nail?

[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.320]
So Richard Conti is dead too, but okay.

[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.140]
Are you serious?

[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:39.480]

[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.980]
Okay, Chuck Meyer, two great dead of relives.

[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:42.520]
That's right.

[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.760]
Richard Conti, he was very good.

[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:45.600]
Excellent actor.

[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.580]
Well, everybody was good and Godfather won.

[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.240]
There was nobody who was marked that.

[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.640]
That's one exception to the role in the eye, I think,

[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.280]
where the movie was better than the book.

[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.240]
No, I don't know.

[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.020]
You read the book?

[00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:56.400]
Of course I read the book.

[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.760]
And you thought the movie was better?

[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:58.960]
Yes, absolutely.

[00:36:59.620 --> 00:36:59.620]

[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.000]
I thought the movie was one of the best of all time.

[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.420]
Oh, there's no question about that.

[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.760]
The movie was just beyond belief.

[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.020]
Tessio, it was great.

[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.260]
That was Abe Gota, right?

[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:08.900]

[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.780]
And Clemenza was Richard Castellano.

[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.140]
Right.

[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:11.720]
Is he dead?

[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:13.440]
Yeah, he just died recently.

[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.200]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.180]
Well, one a little bit too much pasta there.

[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.400]
Remember, he was no too much sugar in that sauce.

[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:19.720]
And a little too much red wine.

[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.920]
Throw in your sausages and meatballs, too many canollies.

[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.340]
And that's a little bit of red wine.

[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.100]
Yeah, he would have left the canole in the car with Polly.

[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:27.580]
There you go.

[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.720]
He'd still be alive today, probably.

[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:34.100]
You'll remember him part two when he goes to seek revenge

[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.760]
on the death of his father.

[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.080]
Right.

[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:37.980]
Do you remember his father's name?

[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.080]
His father's name?

[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.640]
Yeah, it wasn't Corleon.

[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.220]
That was the town they came from.

[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:45.580]
Right.

[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:47.160]
Your member's father's name?

[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:47.640]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.700]
George does.

[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:49.740]
What is it?

[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.140]
What is it, Mesa?

[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:52.680]
Andolini.

[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:53.800]
There you go.

[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:54.960]
Vito Andolini.

[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:55.520]
Alberto.

[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:56.700]
Alberto?

[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.360]
Alberto Andolini.

[00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.520]
And this is for you.

[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.860]
Yeah, he says an Italian.

[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:06.500]
My name is, oh, my name is, or no, I'm here for, uh...

[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.560]
I'm here for my father.

[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.540]
Alberto Andolini.

[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:10.700]
And this is for you.

[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.900]
And he takes the knife and he's right up the puppet up into the...

[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.840]
Oh, and the blood comes just squirting out.

[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:16.480]
It's wonderful.

[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.340]
It sits back in the chair like he's got bad heartburn.

[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.020]
I don't think he's going to get up from the chair.

[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:22.840]
Oh, that was great.

[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:26.120]
I am looking forward to tomorrow with great anticipation.

[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.500]
Yeah, I'm afraid though.

[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.220]
It's, you know, after reading the review,

[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.200]
although, you know, these movie reviewers, they don't know from nothing.

[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.280]
If the public loves it, which we probably will,

[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.760]
then they'll say, well, you know, it's going to be an epic

[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.060]
and a classic and right in line with one and two.

[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:40.860]
Yeah, they don't know.

[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:41.380]
What the hell?

[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.320]
It's got to be good, Neil.

[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:42.800]
Yeah.

[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:43.980]
I mean, you know.

[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.340]
I only wish, though, that Robert Duval.

[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:46.700]
I know.

[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.100]
That would have been the icing on the cake.

[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.100]
Instead of that sappy daughter of his, you know?

[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.660]
She meets Kaito Watt.

[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:52.880]
Yeah.

[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.560]
She's got a schnauz, and make Larry King and Beres.

[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.080]
And lip.

[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:56.860]
Yeah.

[00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:57.700]
Like St. Louis.

[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.600]
Anyway, Neil.

[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.840]
You guys threw last week like a pro.

[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:04.380]
Yeah.

[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:04.780]
Really?

[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.320]
Got a...

[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.140]
I had no choice.

[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.460]
It was a very difficult, but, you know.

[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.020]
You're a munch.

[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.080]
Life is for the living.

[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.580]
That's what they say we've got to go on.

[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.140]
There you go.

[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.840]
Have a wonderful holiday.

[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:16.600]
And you too.

[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.140]
And can't wait for tomorrow.

[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:18.660]
Okay.

[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:19.700]
Town-yell.

[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:20.480]
Boy, boy.

[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.160]
128 at WIOD, one of our rear, but very welcome lady callers.

[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.280]
Today she was outstanding.

[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.100]
All of Broward lines.

[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.840]
Both of the ones that are working are open now.

[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.100]
524 WIO.

[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:31.460]
Springs.

[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:32.880]
Hello, Neil.

[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:33.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:34.500]
How's it going today?

[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:34.980]
Excellent.

[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:35.800]
Very good.

[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.780]
And the same to you in Happy New Year and whatever.

[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:38.880]
Likewise, Happy Hunter.

[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:39.540]
Uh-huh.

[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:40.900]
Listen, what...

[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.240]
I heard Hank had the trouble out in Santa Monica,

[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:43.880]
writing a car.

[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.060]
He did?

[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.320]
You hear about that?

[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:46.960]
I didn't hear it.

[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.080]
He, uh...

[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.500]
We're going to write him a station wagon or a van.

[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:51.140]
Yeah.

[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:52.040]
And, uh...

[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.560]
That just wasn't up to his speed.

[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:54.980]
He needed a nice car for...

[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:56.400]
Uh...

[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.160]
hitting the Santa Monica night spot,

[00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:58.940]
to the hot spot,

[00:39:59.180 --> 00:39:59.740]
to where he put it.

[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.040]
Right.

[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.440]
Now, you know, what is it with Hank and the women?

[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.440]
I can't quite...

[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.180]
I can't quite get a read on him, like Larry King was saying.

[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:08.740]
What is it?

[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:12.380]
Yeah, I mean, he's always bragging about, you know,

[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.540]
all getting all these blinds and...

[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:15.460]
Well, you asked me a question.

[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.940]
I may give you a one word answer.

[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.440]
If you would please.

[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:20.220]
Uh... fantasy.

[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:21.140]
Okay.

[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.140]
I don't know.

[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:22.700]
I have no idea.

[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.380]
Hank is a great guy and all of that.

[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.820]
But I don't know anything about his, uh...

[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:27.360]
personal life.

[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.440]
I know he's always said that, like everybody else,

[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.340]
if he wants something, he's willing to pay for it.

[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.000]
But, you know...

[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.180]
Okay, that makes sense to him,

[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.080]
because I remember back in 1983, I was at the forage.

[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.120]
Oh, in other words, I think he's bisexual,

[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.680]
if he wants it, he got a buy-in.

[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:40.420]
But that could be why.

[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:40.800]
I don't know.

[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.020]
Gotcha.

[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.000]
And Neil, do you remember your trip?

[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.540]
I'm not talking like a hooker on 7.

[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.080]
Nice, we'd I'm talking about a little more,

[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.180]
a little more respectable.

[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:47.760]
Fantasy.

[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.440]
Out of the phone book.

[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:48.920]
There you go.

[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:51.200]
I'm with you, because I saw him at the forage back in 83.

[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:52.900]
Like Angel's fantasies.

[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.160]
One of those great places, you know.

[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.120]
Yeah, he had the greatest blonde I'd ever seen.

[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:56.620]
Of course.

[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.020]
You remember your trip up to Tampa with big day from Highline?

[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:02.660]
From Highline?

[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.380]
Yeah, big day.

[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.160]
So you've been answered Highline?

[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:07.700]
Dave Lennon.

[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:08.180]
Right.

[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.080]
Big day left.

[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.120]
Well, which trip to Tampa?

[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.260]
We made several trips to Tampa.

[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:11.980]
You made a trip up there.

[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.240]
I guess it was you, him.

[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.000]
Dave Lennon.

[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:15.100]

[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:15.800]
For Hurricane Hillsport.

[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:17.200]
You went to Bird's Daycow.

[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:17.680]
Yeah.
