[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900]
The opinions expressed by the guest hosts are called to not necessarily those

[00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.940]
musicians. Now here's Neil Rogers, a new Doc Radio 610 WIOD. Hi, this is Marie

[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.860]
Povich wishing you a happy Hanukkah.

[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.500]
Can't wait, it's going to do it for me. 1007 at WIOD are Camilla's house total. We

[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.100]
don't have the mail yet today, but when we get the mail today we're going to go

[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:29.880]
over another milestone. Depend on it. Our total right now is $79,444 and

[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.040]
$85. I have, where did the $85 come from? That's got to be, people are adding in

[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.840]
that posted stuff. I never add that in because that's the encounter. But anyway, so

[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.160]
we're about $556 away from $80,000 and when the mail comes in today, which is not

[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.200]
a drop of it has yet, that will go over 80 today. So if you have it and by the way

[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.440]
with the first check I opened this morning from last couple of days mail $1,000

[00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.120]
from John Brunetti at highly a park race track who also came up with a

[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.120]
thousand last year. Thank you, John. We may not agree on some things, but you're

[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.520]
okay in our book. Anyways, speaking of okay in our book, I want to thank Bob Weaver,

[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.080]
a channel four Weaver, the weatherman who's just a super guy since a nice

[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.000]
cigar, his little holiday box here, which I'm puffing on right now. What are you

[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.800]
looking for? What a slut. I'm telling you this George is the biggest free loader

[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.600]
I have ever seen in my life. Man, you're in the right business. I'll tell you that.

[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.240]
Free food. Not only does he like the free cigars when a box gets empty. Oh, could I

[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.480]
take that box off? What are you doing selling them? Must be making music boxes out of

[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.680]
them and selling them for Hanukkah or something. What a maniac. All I did was say,

[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.880]
let me show you first of all. It's not like these are mac canudos. Okay. It's a small

[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.760]
box. There's like five of them in there, one of which is in my mouth already. So

[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.480]
unless you like something else in your mouth like my foot, just relax. Okay. Just

[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.280]
the calm down. See, George is all upset because Marvin's been working about a hundred

[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.800]
hours over the holidays. I want to say this about Marvin. Okay. He is a real

[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.980]
puss. I know he's not listening because I'm sure he's not awake yet. Marvin, you are,

[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.540]
and I give you a classic example. Tuesday, he knew I wasn't going to be here yesterday

[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.720]
because it was Bill's funeral. I want to thank Chuck Meyer for doing a great job. A little

[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.780]
bit too good, by the way, but no, he was seriously the great job yesterday. I heard part

[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.640]
of the show. A few too many gummers in there, but it was really good. And so anyway,

[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.000]
Marvin comes in here. Oh, would you like to have Al Goldstein? I'm sure great. So I get

[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.280]
a call Tuesday afternoon from Cheryl at the house. Al Goldstein is lined up for Thursday,

[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.520]
meaning today. Well, that's fine. Al is always a great guest and fun guy and he eats a

[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.940]
lot of food. I have no idea when he's coming. Do you know, George doesn't have any idea?

[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.900]
We don't know what the hell is going on. Another Melvin production. I wonder what Rick

[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.980]
Rowley would do if he lined up a guest for Rick and Puts and they had no idea when

[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.160]
it was coming to that ever happened on their show. I wouldn't be surprised if it's happened

[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.740]
before. They have idiot on the corner today. So I assume that means that you've got to work

[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.380]
eight hours again today. It says on here, boy, look at his eyeballs rolling around like

[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.120]
it looks like Vegas again, like pinballs, idiot on the corner, which means it must be

[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.300]
Melvin going to be standing on a street corner. It's the first indeed comes to my mind.

[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.120]
Anyway, that's coming up a little bit later. I don't forget tomorrow we're going to be

[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.840]
doing our show live from Charcoals, the brand new one, which is a 5426 North University

[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.140]
drive just out the commercial Boulevard on the east side of university. It's in at the

[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.860]
strip shopping center, the Acat and this it just out the commercial and there's going

[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.380]
to be a free buffet with some finger food and wings and whatever provided by Charcoals

[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.060]
and we got some things we're going to be drawing for as usual. We have a hundred dollar

[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.400]
gift certificate from Berens. We got a whole bunch of Zuba caps and Zuba pants that the

[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.020]
dolphin folks are donating, which we're very appreciative. So be sure and come by, of

[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.460]
course, naturally we'll have the tapes and the t-shirts to raise as much as we can tomorrow

[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.680]
for Camilo Sal. So we are well on our way to our goal of a hundred thousand. I have

[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.380]
full confidence we're going to get there because like I said, today we'll go over 80 and

[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.760]
we should do what three, four, five thousand year tomorrow at Charcoals, easy, right? So

[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.320]
sometime next week we'll go over 90, no problem. In January, fourth, our next remote by the

[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.440]
way will be at Clalder Race Track, which could be a very expensive remote for me. Also

[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.040]
speaking to things coming up tonight, Christmas list through the six-hole. I notice he's

[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.960]
the morning line favorite five to two in the morning line with Bill Faye at Pompoot

[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.960]
Park. So all the members of our stable, be sure to make it out there tonight. I will

[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.200]
be there. But Rich will be there with bells on for Christmas list as it goes for three in

[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:45.040]
a row. Anyway, it's time now to talk about pizza law. Now, seriously, you know what, I'm

[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.100]
playing that. I'm watching the news on Channel six last night and who comes on, they're

[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.840]
doing a piece on this thing about the Dennis and the Mercury vapors and all this stuff.

[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.620]
And Steve Greenberg, who's their resident medical maven, whatever is doing this piece. And

[00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.800]
who does he have on there? But Mrs. Jeff Cohen, the lovely Mrs. Cohen is on there. I didn't

[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.260]
tell you earlier in the week that Jeff and his wife are, and if they haven't already done

[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.240]
it, they're doing it this week. They're going with the Dennis getting everything yanked

[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.960]
and the filling's two 10, 16 at W.I.O.D. Boy, do we have a little menagerie in here now?

[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.040]
Oh, just relax. Wait a minute. I can't believe Boy Geary coming in here making those sounds

[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.540]
in the middle of the show. Anyway, yes, we as you want his own show, I know a station

[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.260]
that's hiring anybody that's breathing. What is it? You want to speak up?

[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.680]
Okay. This is really not. Okay. Like I said, it's 10, 16. You talk about a show going

[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.640]
to the dogs, Al Goldstein's here. Now, why don't you select what you're one of those

[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.300]
you like where you're picking up. You can speak it all three of them. When you're going

[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.940]
to lose some weight already, right? Although I will say this, I will say this. I'm very

[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.700]
impressed. He didn't bring in that big box of Cheerios or whatever. Last time you were

[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.520]
here, that was the most disgusting thing. I mean, you talk about compulsive, seriously.

[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.800]
Brings in this enormous, economy, industrial size box of Cheerio and was eating it all

[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.320]
during the show. It's kind of like a warm up to get his palate going before we brought

[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.480]
the food in. Now, do we want food for you today? Coffee and patting's hungry for breakfast.

[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.120]
It's a special day today. It's a third year anniversary. Well, happy year. Three years

[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.880]
now, Goldstein. Wow. And they say romance is dead. Yeah. And how does the dog figure

[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.060]
into all of this? That's a child. Love child. Well, that's the love child. Yeah. Well,

[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.920]
are you really? Well, good. I hope it's not a scrawny. Is that one? Anyway, well, he

[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:48.460]
is a little scrawny. Is any? Maybe if you leave a few scrap sheet on what? Well, what

[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.800]
is the dog? I've never seen such an anorexic looking dog in all my life. It looks like

[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.500]
Karen Carpenter's dog. I eat her food. Yeah, that's what I was just going to say. Maybe

[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.580]
if you leave a few table scraps around, she wouldn't look like cheese like hell. People

[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:04.740]
tell me you've mellowed. Neu, you are picking on her dog. Who the hell told you that? I

[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.000]
just to talk into New York. Did you? In New York? What do they know about me in New York?

[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.200]
They don't know me from Moichin, but pick in New York. They do. You're personality. No,

[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.960]
you are known in New York City. Howard even talks about me now. He really does. He says

[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.000]
good thing. I can't believe it. He must have mellowed. I'm serious because he used to

[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.900]
get upset. I'd rip his hair all the time. You got to admit howard's got bad hair. He's

[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.840]
worse and his nose is the worst. He's really well. His nose is getting like Larry King. In

[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.300]
fact, I think Howard in 30, 40 years, it looks just like Larry looks today. Holy not. It's

[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.100]
full of crap. Anyway, before we get started with Alan, I just wanted to say a couple of

[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.380]
things. Because yesterday I attended the bill called as funeral. I want to thank Tom

[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.060]
Jicke and the people at the Harold are wrote a nice obituaries about Bill who was one of

[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:51.020]
my best friends and a super guy. And I also, you know, when you go to a funeral, generally

[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.500]
it's a very, you know, not an uplifting thing. It's very depressing. It wasn't bad. The

[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.740]
only fact rich was there, of course. And I was there. And when you're at a Catholic church

[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:04.580]
and they're doing the service and you're Jewish, it's a little confusing because, you

[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.000]
know, any of the religionists, I mean, they all get into a real religious thing with

[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.980]
the service. And there was one part where they have like a kneeling. Have you ever seen

[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.340]
that in a church where they're like a kneeling bar? You'd be great on that. Boy, can you

[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.180]
just see all the rows rolling over with you, Neelah? And so, you know, when they're doing

[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.900]
the other prayers, you sit there and you're respectful and you keep your mouth shut.

[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.280]
But then they have, let's kneel and pray. And they have a kneeling bar that like folds

[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.460]
down from the pew in front of you and they're folds down. You kneel down on it. So you

[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:35.580]
don't have to kneel on the floor. And fat rich is in the row behind me. Okay. And he's

[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.860]
as big as you are pretty close to it. And we didn't know what to do. He's Jewish also.

[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.200]
So like, I'm, I, because all the all of pubbures, I was one of more in the front rows. So

[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.780]
naturally these other guys are all Catholic. They're all relatives of the family. They

[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.500]
kneel down. So I did too, just out of respect. All of a sudden, I hear like a commotion behind

[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.980]
me. And then I think he thought better of it because rich was about to try to kneel down

[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.940]
on this thing. I mean, they would be like, like a hippopotamus, try to kneel down on

[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.760]
the tip of a needle. You know, I mean, just forget it. So that was a little bit. But I just

[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.560]
want to mention a lead founder and Lee and I have, you know, chewed each other out on

[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.120]
a year for years and back and forth. But there's a radio show. See, there's a difference.

[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.740]
Some people don't understand it. They're like, you know me. There's a difference between

[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.720]
what's on a year and persons that and real life and Lee Fowler flew all the way and he was

[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.040]
on vacation. He was in North Carolina. He was a good friend of bills flew all the way

[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.580]
in to be there yesterday. And that to me says a lot. That was nice. Steve from Hollywood,

[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.460]
who over the years has been a chronic caller. And you know, he and I have gone around

[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:37.680]
back and forth because he's a sensitive guy. But not only was he there, but he spent a lot

[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.580]
of time in a hospital with Bill and really just was super and just a great guy. I just

[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.340]
mentioned these things so that because people are regular listeners that get to know these

[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:50.440]
people. Even the callers are like personalities. Jim Schuyler was there. Another radio person.

[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.860]
Randy Martin was there and Mike Knight and the Steve Brady Brody from QAM. Even Howard

[00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:00.020]
Primer was there from KAT, which I'll, the less I say about that, the better. Champaign

[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:04.040]
Lew and other listener was there who's he and I have gone. I guess everybody and I have

[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.800]
gone around. Absolutely. But the fact they showed up was great. And some of the racetracked

[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:13.140]
people Lester was there dressed to kill. Looked like he was ready for the second race and

[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.900]
Freddie Ferrell and Fred the Usher who's been just a super friend to both of us for a long

[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.960]
time and the Phil Saltsman. And I'm sure I'm leaving somebody out. But I just want to

[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.400]
thank all those people for showing up. Okay. Can I do a little break and then we'll get

[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:32.320]
to with my. Okay. We get a coffee. Oh, you are. He's addicted to food. He's addicted to

[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.780]
coffee. Can we get this man some coffee? We do have coffee downstairs in a cafeteria.

[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.280]
We'll take care of that and some breakfast from Wayne Arnold. Would that be good?

[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:44.360]
You'll be going to pat his. Yeah. Yeah. She's a win and Murray. I'm sure can bring

[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.620]
over some breakfast stuff. Okay. From Arnold's Royal Castle. But you're not going to

[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.980]
make a pig yourself today. I wouldn't be good. I'm trying to be the sheriff. You have

[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.060]
to be in training. I am. I'm going to be thin by the time the election. And by the way,

[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.780]
these vote for our gold steam t-shirts do you have a number of these? Yes. I get you

[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:03.260]
a sum because if you could give me some tomorrow at Charcoal's, it would be great. Absolutely

[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:08.340]
send them down to you tonight. Great. That's outstanding. Okay. 1022. Our gold

[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.120]
steam of screw magazine and midnight blue and just a generally disgusting guy is here.

[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.000]
And we want to talk about food again as we always do on a show. Our Parmesan

[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.480]
restaurant at Pinabah. The go goes now. Be careful. The go goes. We have on my

[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.960]
cables. You're midnight blue. We have the raw bloat tape. By the way, we have coffee

[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:34.380]
for him and the dog. Okay. Heavy sugar on the dog. Man, my dog barked that much.

[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.740]
You would be in the microwave immediately. Okay. What is your story? She's just excited

[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.740]
to be here in the next time. She excited to be away from all that food in the house.

[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.020]
I'm telling you, this dog I bet she has eaten in months. So the go goes. You know who

[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:52.840]
the go go. Yeah. Right. Who's a call? Is this is a feature thing? So we got some

[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:59.320]
tapes of them involved with some sexual escapades. Not explicit sex. And one of the

[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:05.460]
girls in the go goes. Does some cocaine. It's just a weird tape. What we've been doing

[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:10.280]
in this is selling it. I'm in that blue. It's it's a low it's bad quality, but it's a

[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:16.400]
good. It's a nice curiosity. It's better than a roblo tape or a roblo tape. It's the worst

[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:21.660]
parable. And you know, since that tape, he's like there are nobody talks about it. It's

[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.740]
funny. And his last movie was good. Did you see his last movie? He's not bad influence.

[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:32.340]
I thought it was terrible. Have you not loved it? So based on why the idea of the corrupt

[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:37.300]
ability of life. I'll take a rock movie. What's coming to shock to you? Yes. Burda

[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:42.760]
luchis new film sheltering sky. I sorted a screening. What's wrong with New York is all

[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:48.280]
these east side intellectuals. We're loving a film that was indecisable, incomprehensible.

[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.460]
After an hour, Patty and I woke up, we have no idea what it's about. Deborah Winger

[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:57.580]
is wasted. And that's what I hate about Jewish intellectuals. No one has the the

[00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:02.440]
huts for to walk out. They don't want it to make me they understood this absolutely

[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:07.780]
moronic meaningless film. I'm sure it'll wind up here in Miami in six weeks, but it's

[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.020]
a terrible movie. Like Blue Velvet. That's another great suit of one. I like that you like.

[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.940]
I like Blue Velvet. Another film that I think is disappointing is this Woody Allen film

[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:22.760]
Alice. I don't know. I don't like him. Alice. It's as if Woody Allen's as if you've

[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:28.180]
been locked in the same control room with a bore. You know, you've had said or an elevated

[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.840]
Woody Allen doesn't live in the real world with a bore. He said like be a boy or be

[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:39.580]
a way on. It's a insufferable insufferable movie. And everyone went that everyone. Most

[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:44.940]
people in New York City of Eastside Woody Allen to get him coffee, by the way, because

[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.440]
I'm getting nervous. I hate coffee, but I'm just getting nervous. What? You want to

[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.800]
do it? Because nobody probably the rest of this building there on permanent vacation

[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:57.280]
from now till the second and January. This starts about the first of December. And you

[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:07.780]
know, there's no note. I tell you what, let's fill in the gap. Now you're getting all

[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:13.040]
your thumbs up, by the way. Oh my filling. Didn't you see the thing? I saw it cool. My

[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:18.580]
dentist is the next day. I'm absolutely nervous. I think that's why I'm fat. I tell you

[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.860]
that I'm my solution. It has to be. There has to be an excuse. It can be that I'm weak

[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:30.520]
willed. No, no, because I've seen you waiting. I was very delicate with both hands. Anyway,

[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.980]
Al Goldstein has got his new t-shirts on. Now I want to say something to you because I

[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:38.880]
never want to be accused of saying things behind people's back. I said it a couple of

[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:44.840]
months ago. It's fun that you want to run against our sheriff Nick, okay, against our

[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:49.560]
fascist pig up there in Brown. Okay. And desperately we need somebody to beat him. But

[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.640]
you're not going to win the election. I think I have a chance. I'll tell you what.

[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:57.840]
Based on what you have no experience in law. You're known as Mr. pornography. Now

[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.080]
Howard County has got this in spite of the fact that we got a few Jews in Brown. County

[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.260]
Broward is basically a vash in a right-wing Neanderthal thing. It is. It is. But the way

[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.580]
to fight. Here the story in Hollywood this morning about what was that play that they

[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.680]
went? They they cited some building where they had this play because there was a nude

[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.740]
scene in it. Mayor Oliver. I mean, they just went on. It's the red that play. They're

[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:24.540]
red next state. But even in Texas, the two-live crew thing, they threw the thing out of

[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.240]
court. You're I see in Louisiana. You know, Louisiana, you figure because they're all a bunch

[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:33.760]
of Yahoo. But this is supposed to be a sophisticated state. This is, you know, I was thinking this

[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.560]
morning coming to work as I knew you were going to be on the rest of the world is moving

[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.960]
in one direction. And communism is totally failed. We're getting all these countries going

[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.380]
to democratic and having this big thing in a Soviet Union and Chiburnodze quit this morning

[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.100]
and they're all up in arms because they're trying to move toward democracy. And even he

[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.700]
said it in his speech. I saw clips of the speech and they were interpreting it. What we

[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.440]
need is a, you know, full move to democracy. The rest of the world is moving in one direction.

[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:02.720]
And this country is moving to become a fascist state. This country reminds me of like Paraguay

[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.860]
and Argentina of recent years. More and more repressive and more and more Neanderthal.

[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.460]
I don't understand. But you see, the forces of stupidity and permissiveness are always

[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:17.680]
at war. I don't know if you saw this special last night. Ted Combo, Seth Sinrusha, Vasnez,

[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:23.380]
wonderful. Gays are getting more liberated. The prostitution is coming out of the class.

[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:29.160]
The pornography is selling all over all those years of stifling, of natural human instincts.

[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:35.040]
It bursts through. Now, you're right. In terms of Nikhnavaro, my campaign is going to

[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:41.140]
be fight crime, kick-knit-out because I really is a corrupt sheriff's office. What people

[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.960]
will have in me, you're right, because I don't have law enforcement experience, is a man

[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.720]
with integrity and honesty. And I won't lie. And I'll bring in the best people. And I

[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.120]
have a list of the things the sheriff does. I'm not going to read it. But it's a hundred

[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:58.100]
different things. Any Ohio experts to run it running a sheriff's office is like running

[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:03.100]
a radio station or business. But don't you fear that somebody legitimate? Because then

[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.680]
a lot of people look at you. I hate to use them. More but a lot of people just say, well,

[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.360]
you're not a legitimate candidate. You're just a your clown. Somebody legitimate is going

[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.520]
to run against him. And enough people could vote for you. Siphonov votes from whoever

[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.900]
the contender is and get him back in there again. I don't think he's going to let that

[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.080]
I honestly think that with the real fear, I'm not so sure he's going to be able to run

[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.640]
it. The president is doing a great job. I got to commend them, which is unusual for me.

[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.900]
They're doing a great job on exposing him and a fraud. And I mean, almost every day

[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:35.120]
there's stuff coming out of him and stuff with his wife choosing over judges. I'm afraid

[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:40.160]
he's not the one. That's just I will only run against him. So I'm afraid he's going

[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:45.920]
to pull a Nixon in quit office. I'm because the interest from me is he is absolutely galvanized.

[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:53.320]
The stupid forces in this area with his pro censorship really absurd point. By the way,

[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:59.240]
speaking of Nixon, and I got to bring it in for Chuck Meyer because he's a big buck of

[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.520]
the Kennedy assassination theories as I am. And during vacation on the plane, I read

[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:08.340]
it. I almost finished reading the new book on the assassinations called High Treason. Have

[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:13.220]
you read it? No, but you should read it because the conclusions I'm coming to the end of

[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:17.120]
the book for the basic conclusions is that Nixon was definitely involved with the assassinations

[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.040]
both the junk and the Martin Luther King was in Texas with Howard Hunt the night before

[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.000]
and also that Richard Helms was the former director of the CIA was involved as well. I had

[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.080]
brought to the guy who make a great guest, the Michael Baden, BAD and ex-con of the city.

[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:37.860]
He was the Con on the Warren Commission. He still defends it, but I think even he is

[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.360]
having doubts. I mean, it's a shame it's going to be 25 years after with dead that the

[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:47.040]
truth is going to come. If ever. Why did any Kennedy keep quiet? That's that's why

[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.500]
were the Kennedy side? Well, they say that the plane crash, remember he broke his back

[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.880]
and nearly got killed in the plane crash that that also was part of this that was an attempt

[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.960]
on his life too. See the old days we would have said conspiracy theory, not, but no, no

[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.820]
longer. Now it's a little plausible, incredible. Well, almost nobody believes the Warren

[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.300]
Commission anymore. It's a joke. Did you, we will believe in during the early days I

[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:12.300]
used to love Mark Lane. I don't like you. Person of a rush to judgment. I was, that was

[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:17.160]
the first book. Right. I remember seeing him speaking to you. I always felt it was extraordinary

[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:22.220]
that the media stifled this kind of truth. Also, Alan Lowens theme, by the way, you must

[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:27.320]
have died too. Right. New York was shot and was about to bring out a lot of things about

[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.920]
the Bobby Kennedy assassination. Right. But yeah, why are we going off into that? But

[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.400]
just, but the book high treason, if anybody out there is interested in the subject, you've

[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.800]
got to read it. It's just, you know, you read all these books over the years and you figure

[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.940]
out one more what's going to be new in here. But it really puts together some heavy-duty

[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:48.600]
stuff. You know, when they're all fused together, we till the New Yorker about two years

[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:54.580]
ago and later came on as a book about how Lyndon Johnson stole the election. And I was so

[00:19:54.580 --> 00:20:00.560]
here racing seeing his immorality in 1942. It would be an easy extension for him to knock

[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:07.780]
out a competitor who was blocking his positioning to the presidency. I mean, we really do live

[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:13.420]
in a corrupt society. And, and so when you raise the question about am I serious with Nick,

[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:18.560]
I know it's a long shot, but I think at least for once, let's only speak truth to people

[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.000]
that you can't clear everything up. At least I'll have an honest political office because

[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.760]
I don't need the money. I'm a millionaire. Nick is cutting deals. He's got a job for his wife.

[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.160]
There's always this sex scandal now with the quick sex with the quick milk. I mean, it's just,

[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.460]
it's, it's, it's truly up to you. I mean, we really have to fight climb and get rid of Nick.

[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.960]
Hey, man. Okay. I want to talk about the t-shirts are incredible. You're going to get them on

[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.860]
those. Great. In fact, I'm jealous. Are they fantastic with these are? In fact, what was this

[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:53.140]
picture of you taking? What's that? Man. Oh, man. It looks a little like Charlie Manson in that

[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:58.040]
picture, too. Anyway, it's 10.35 L. Volstein's here. Let's talk about Calder. Okay. Everybody

[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.640]
likes a challenge that's just a new sound we play in a bad. We would like to challenge the

[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.580]
Justin who sound we play in a back all the time for anyway, once again, they're filling

[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:09.700]
them out. The mercury vapors that are making you fat, not the absolute it weakens my will power.

[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.900]
Now, anybody that wakes up, this, this story is worth repeating on a year. He wakes up last night,

[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:19.060]
three o'clock in the morning and is sitting there sitting up in bed, staring ahead,

[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.620]
fantasizing about going to the refrigerator to get salami at three o'clock in the morning,

[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:29.140]
but doesn't have the energy because he's such a gigantic fat blob. He don't have the energy to

[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.940]
get out of the second go to the refrigerator. That's the next thing. It's going to happen. He's

[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.560]
going to move the refrigerator in the bedroom. Then you're being real trouble. It's true. But at

[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.380]
the moment, I'm a fool for the dog. I have, seriously, is that Karen Carpenter's dog?

[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:45.760]
Dog food is not bad. They had a segment last night on inside edition or inside story,

[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:51.740]
one of those hysterical tabloids and it was about puppy meals. Did you see it? And they showed,

[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.540]
oh, man, of course, I love dogs like you do. And they showed all these pathetic jammed in these

[00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:02.560]
cages and, oh, and it looked very similar to what I'm seeing there genetically. We might share,

[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.740]
if we were in Brown County, you're lucky. We're in date. I got news for you. If we were in Brown,

[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.620]
and Sheriff Nick might get your ass in jail right now for a rock, get the SPCA in here.

[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:15.260]
Nick Wood. Yeah. Yeah. It sees it on either. Anyway, the T-shirt is on

[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.520]
conversation. Now, how are you going to get them to meet? Because I'm not coming back here.

[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:23.340]
I need them. No, we're doing a short charcoal tomorrow, which is not far from you. It's

[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.540]
university. It's just out the commercial. One time, and then one and a two.

[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:35.720]
Can you see that? They have nice hamburger. They have a great food. Before I leave,

[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.860]
oh, man, you're brutal. Anyway, the T-shirts are black, and they've got the American flag

[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:46.260]
with L's skinny face in the middle. Boy, that's from another era. That's a political

[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:50.200]
picture. I'm guilty. I will lie about that. And it says gold steam forever, and then underneath

[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.960]
for Sheriff Brown County 1992, these are sharp. I'll tell you, a lot of people would pay some

[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.980]
bucks to your wife. And I got you an extra launch too. I have an extra extra launch for the,

[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:04.060]
yeah, you got two of them sewn together for you. I can see, I can see the seams in the middle.

[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:09.320]
So you're serious about this. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to commit a

[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:14.580]
couple hundred thousand dollars for radio and television. If Nick resigns, of course, I won't

[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:19.580]
draw. It's contingent on him. And I'm afraid he's not malleable. You look back at the history

[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:23.840]
of Brown County. I'm going to be honest. A lot of people forget about it. We have had ever since

[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:32.160]
I've been in his town, which is almost 15 years now. We've had repressive right wing thinking.

[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:38.780]
We had Ed Stack. Remember Ed Stack? Another real far-bison right-winger. We had Bob Butterworth,

[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:45.100]
who was a little less militant, but still a pretty right wing. And it just been a succession of

[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:49.920]
right-wing sheriffs. But you have to look around on federal, on the highway. They're at

[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:54.120]
accomplice clubs. You have an app for that. They're trying like crazy to close to them. But that's

[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.660]
the political. And Hasselwood Crap bottle. See, that's the stuff I would not do. I would leave

[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:04.000]
Michael Peters alone. I would leave the straight clubs, the gay clubs, the punitive

[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.080]
here's alone. I would put all my manpower in the street fighting crime. That is when Nick

[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.400]
Ways system. There are many. That's dangerous. You're right. That's that. That's that.

[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.820]
For listening to rock lyrics and saying, two-life crew is dirty. They mean the music may be

[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.940]
alive. It's the as we lived in a town where the people had any balls at all. Where we had living

[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.320]
and breathing people. I mean, you can understand it, Louisiana. I mean, they almost

[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.740]
elected David Duke to the Senate, Louisiana. They're a bunch of neonatoos are from the

[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:31.580]
bayou. Okay, they're a bunch of triglydites. But here where we have all these people from

[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:36.140]
New York and supposedly sophisticated people, the fact that they sit back and they tolerate this

[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:40.560]
Crap and they let all their taxpayer money be they wasted all that money in the trial with Charles

[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.560]
Freeman. And then they find him when they find him a thousand or ten thousand, whatever the hell

[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:49.140]
I was on the surface and all of that crap. And then the other trial that they that they lost,

[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.780]
which still the taxpayers had a pay for that Crap. And now even after they lose that trial,

[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:58.660]
he says, well, if anybody else performs that song or those lyrics in Broward County because

[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.720]
that's the law, I'm going to prosecute them too. Which in other words, he's saying he's going to

[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.520]
continue wasting the tax prison. You know what they do? They sit back, we get a few calls on

[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.160]
and talk show they grumble about it, they're pissed off and that's it. But that's when the change,

[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:14.400]
the TV and the re-call movement against him right now. Get his ass out of there now. You know,

[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:23.760]
in the years we get closer to this, he will not appear in debate because his right hand. Maybe he'll

[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.360]
I'm going to have best mice and campaigning for me. So I'm going to get all the New York Jew votes.

[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.660]
I mean, all the Jewish votes are going to be there. I really believe that people are getting second

[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:35.280]
time. Well, anyway, my friend, you said honestly and credibility will probably show, but she was acquitted

[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:40.860]
and I like this. And people love it. She was the first Jewish Muslim. And she was a good main code.

[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.280]
She's a pretty woman. Yeah. The point is I really, you know, is that mean you bring an

[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.860]
crotch down here too? No, I don't like it. Did you see the picture ahead the other day? He was

[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:55.340]
the funniest thing I've seen in years. Ed Koch was over in Israel and Jerusalem. And in the reason he

[00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:01.400]
was there, he was doing a tourism campaign to show that it's not dangerous to travel to Israel.

[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.340]
Because let's let's face it. Who in the right mind is the way thing is that I'm in the Middle East

[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:09.340]
right now is going to travel. So he's doing this PR thing for the Chamber of Commerce, I guess,

[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:14.620]
or the equivalent of it. And it gets hit in the head by Iraq by some maniac over there. Bernie gets through it.

[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:21.700]
And the picture with him holding his head was just classic. It was incredible.

[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.060]
It was the New York phone this week, but he's still too close. He's on this earth.

[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:30.100]
He was almost enough to make him come out of the closet. Ed is so arrogant and so conservative.

[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:35.660]
Truthfully that he would make a great share of he follows in the line of that kind of reactionary.

[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:42.400]
What is your other right home? Basically, he's simply hypocritical. He really is. And he's never boring.

[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:48.420]
That's going to nick Navarro is never boring, but they do a disservice to public service. That's the problem.

[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:53.960]
Rest assured in two years when I'm the sheriff of ICU Speedy, your little sports cars will be pulled over.

[00:26:54.280 --> 00:27:00.560]
I'm going to nail you, Nick. I thought you were looking at me when you said no, no, no, no, that's enough.

[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:05.660]
We're looking for the turquoise Corvette. That's right. Nailed the car, nailed the speeders.

[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:10.400]
Listen, I want to say something, man. Share a child with a story about the child's

[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:15.400]
arrest that he was coming back from Georgia. Yeah. To a Tallahassee 80 and a 50 and he got pulled over.

[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:20.920]
We got a speeding ticket. I'd rather I'm delighted. I'd rather have a guy who's in a hurry who

[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.400]
is a living and breathing person in Spudwallow things. They said about him with the drugs and everything

[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:29.280]
that a guy who wants to take his back 20 years. You know, who's going backwards? What's the last time?

[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:35.780]
You had Nick on the show, right? Years ago. Is he afraid to come on now? Well, I don't do that kind

[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:39.220]
of a show. I know right. So there'd be no point in my inviting him on the show. I don't I don't know.

[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:44.100]
I have no idea. I don't hear him a lot on any of the other shows. He's turned down eight debates with

[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:50.280]
me. Truthfully, I mean, he's really afraid to come on. So I think he's rethinking his his his

[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:55.660]
running and I'm afraid he's going to withdraw that that would be the saddest thing for me because I

[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.720]
will be sad for you, but it would be great for the rest of the truth. So I would observe

[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:03.120]
the better who would succeed him. Couldn't possibly. I mean, I think the guy's gone soft in the head.

[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.660]
I really do. I don't I mean, he was in the beginning. He was he had that kind of right wing Cuban

[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:12.300]
mentality, you know, like we've seen a date kind of that repressive, but not like this, but the last

[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:18.100]
year or two. So he just got off the deep end. Well, it will have served the purpose if we get him

[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:22.840]
more than that. I mean, that will be a positive step forward. I agree with you. Although it's not

[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:27.820]
an isolated thing. You know, I'm going to talk about the Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory.

[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.820]
I'm not one of these paranoid people of things. There's a conspiracy under every rock. But

[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.420]
they had a story. I don't remember what show it was on. I'm going to say about on the CBS even

[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:42.600]
a few nights ago about the porn raids in LA and about all these buster doing out about how this all

[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:47.080]
stay. It was about a week or two ago. All this started with this meat commission. That's right.

[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:51.020]
That we had under Reagan. And now it's continuing. And they're just going all around the country and

[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:56.060]
just going crazy. And you know, the man who started this, who's instrumental was Charles Keating

[00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:02.540]
from the SNL. From he started in Cincinnati. This man has waged a campaign against pornography

[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:07.140]
and look at his morality. He is single-handedly almost destroyed America's economic base.

[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:12.600]
Again, you always find it's the person who's most, most virtuous is most hypocritical sexually.

[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:19.660]
I mean, this is the point I hate. Everyone wants to handle our sexuality. And this, they have

[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:24.900]
their hand in the till. Charles Keating is a disgrace. And there he was, his anti-pointer force,

[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.740]
this great voice of morality. And how many billions of dollars have they robbed from us?

[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:34.300]
I don't think in our lifetime though. I don't think in this country. There's no hope. We're not

[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.940]
going to make a lot of progress as long as you. Maybe in a hundred years or fifty years. But I don't

[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:44.100]
think you're going to see much change at our time because it's hopeless. The immaturity and the

[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.180]
hypocrisy of the people in this country just drives me nuts. And that's why every summer, now that I

[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:52.320]
get my two week vacation in summer, I wouldn't miss going to Europe. I've always had my deathbed,

[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.160]
which I had just had my stroke last summer. And I still went over there. I stayed a couple of days

[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.940]
and it feel like red. I came back with just just the ambiance and the attitudes and the

[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:06.140]
their light years ahead of us. And yeah, they don't have as many fancy hotels and as many big buildings.

[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:12.160]
And they don't have as not as many people at VCRs and fancy cars. But in terms of their maturity and

[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:17.060]
our attitudes about sex and about almost everything in life, their light years ahead of us.

[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:21.180]
Well, here, the dark age. Right in Fort Lauderdale, it'll find and screen bikinis.

[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.560]
In Europe, there are nude beaches. If you had seen the TV show last night on Ted Comple,

[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:33.020]
so first time I saw breasts and vaginas and pubic hair on television. But that's because they would

[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:37.960]
have looked too hypocritical talking about Russian sexuality and the awakening of Russia's

[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:42.360]
interests and sex and the growth and then have America suppress it. I mean, it really is,

[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:47.220]
it's a real vine for, well, must have been a vine for ABC. And I'll bet you people will complain

[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:52.140]
to the FCC. You're showing breasts. You're showing pubic hairs. We are so sexually immature,

[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:58.500]
though area where Russia was weakest was in the area of gay sex and in condoms.

[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:02.960]
They argue condoms are safe and they're unavailable. Somebody had a grade line. He said,

[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:09.440]
using a condom is they trying to, they trying to smell a rose with a gas mask on. I thought

[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.860]
that was a great metaphor. Well, I want to steal that. You should steal it, too.

[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:19.240]
Okay, let's do a little break. It's 10.50. Oh, boy. Well, I guess there's no better time to

[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.320]
now to do this. If you've been nice this year, he for a W.I.O.D. Al Goldstein is here,

[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.560]
pervader of smut and the pornography and trash. That's why he's here. We like him.

[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:33.140]
Now, seriously, though, since this thing in L.A., which what they were doing is busting people for

[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:39.060]
transporting across state lines, that's what I was busted for in 74.

[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.700]
My best scene material right there. So, so let me ask you, is there anywhere today

[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:50.680]
in this country that knew, because, you know, most of the stuff that's available on tape is like two

[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.160]
years old, five years old, whatever. Is there stuff that is being made today? Yes.

[00:31:55.300 --> 00:32:00.260]
Or these people all the way? The guy who we both despise physically and run Jeremy. But oh,

[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:07.240]
I'm sure he's been late in the hairball. Oh, he's hairy and fat. He is now approaching our

[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:13.680]
weight category. Ronnie is making films. The problem is they're so fair. The one day one is the

[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:20.560]
Shondermot tell rooms. The quality is bad. They're still being made. The interesting thing in the

[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:25.060]
bust in L.A., they're not invoking the Riko law, which is what's always gotten so many people in

[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:32.520]
the point of business nervous. When George Bush or Ronald Reagan or Nixon wants a distraction,

[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:39.400]
you do, you try to out the gaze, you try to out the point of films. It's give them services.

[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:43.620]
It's that philosophy. And it must work most of the time. You're a fatal, not a fatal. It's your

[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:50.060]
cynical about a salmone. It must keep the American public occupied and modified because to a

[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:55.540]
large degree, why did the politicians keep doing it? The thing is, people in this country have found

[00:32:55.540 --> 00:33:00.140]
most of them are very uptight. In other words, they're hypocrites only because they're so afraid.

[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:06.300]
So you go to the movies. I'm talking about regular movies. If a movie isn't rated R,

[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:10.480]
you know, like if it's rated PG and it's Mary Poppins or if it's kids, it's Disney, it'll do well.

[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:15.760]
But if it isn't rated R, and it doesn't have a lot of four letter words and nudity in it,

[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.760]
forget it. It's not going to make it. So obviously, that's where the public tastes are. I mean,

[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.740]
the masses. I mean, the masses are not going to go see the role and ban her. They're not into that

[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:30.040]
anymore. They want to see adult mature related things that are a reflection of real life.

[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:35.500]
And yet, if you talk to a lot of people, you don't have the balls to put it in those terms. In

[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:41.560]
other words, they're very hypocritical and it's embarrassing. I don't watch soap operas. I'm sure

[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:46.000]
you don't, but on the occasion I have. I watch the guided light. I've been watching it since I was a kid.

[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:50.240]
Okay, I never got into soap operas, but when I have watched an occasion, it's amazing how

[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:55.080]
sexual they are. Everyone's in bed and in the middle of the afternoon. Now, why? Because it's giving

[00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:01.100]
the housewife to a large degree. I'm more interesting life than her life really is. So it shows that

[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:08.520]
because it's popular, people wanted it. Filts are needed. Why are we so angry at ourselves? What

[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:15.740]
can a self hatred is generated that we have to feel apologetic about our love of sex? Something

[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:21.480]
that Patty watches. What's that show you watch about picking mates and stuff? What's that?

[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:29.860]
Love connection. Love connection. It is horrible. It's filled with innuendo. It's raunchy, and it's funny,

[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:38.780]
but in America, it has to be dirty. Childish. It's very adolescent. Like, his 14-year-olds

[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:45.420]
talking about how far they can urinate or how they masturbate or something. It's always with a dirty

[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:50.640]
leering quality. That's the American mentality. Very sophomore. I would not have been successful with

[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:55.620]
screw. If I had not approached it the only way I know how to, in an image, you'll away.

[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:01.240]
Screw is like a dirty joke. It's not mature, sophisticated sexuality. Because that's how American

[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:07.980]
men look at sex. And obviously, American women, or I always believe, look at sex in some romantic

[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:15.400]
way. Sex is secondary to finding this magical guy who's going to change their life. I mean, I

[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:21.880]
mud and women will marry a doctor. There really are differences. And it's a shame. It becomes a

[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:27.060]
cliche. What is the latest chain? I mean, I know 7-11 Southland went bankrupt. Thank God. I'm so

[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:31.780]
pleased to go there. And most there was another chain where we recently, Loa Circle K, or one of the

[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:37.300]
other ones that just banned all the hustle or playboy and penthouse again. And really, what we're

[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:41.800]
talking about is a small group of fanatic right-wing, religious, and other right-wing fanatics and

[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:47.220]
John Virtus. These people. And they're controlling the taste for everybody in this country. And the rest

[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:52.920]
of the people are a bunch of sheep and they're worried about how many Rolex watches they can buy and

[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:58.420]
how many material things they've got. They don't give a damn. And yet, which is one of the main reasons

[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:02.960]
that I stopped doing that kind of talk four or five years ago. You might as well be talking to that

[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.960]
helium tank over there. It's a waste of time. I agree with you. I, through it times, I listen to you

[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:13.200]
really cynical. He's really turned off. And yet, I understand why because you do think, hey,

[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:18.440]
I've been through this before, deja vu. The good news is that the people who want and married

[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:24.080]
with children off the air lost. And it's raining so still big. I notice on TV and I'll say this on

[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:29.280]
radio. You can say that they say the word pistola for a lot. The word AS can be used. And with

[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:34.040]
television, it's maturing in terms of language. It's shocked me in a way when I realized you could

[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:39.740]
never have said that. It's so slow. I mean, the thing with Jeff Power and Water Closet.

[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:43.260]
What are we going to grow up? I was watching something on TV the other night. I was thinking of

[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:48.000]
the same thing because they avoided using a certain word and they just tapped ants around it.

[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.260]
This thing with words. When hell has it ever been shown and words hurt people? I'm not talking

[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:56.200]
about slander and I mean, they're legal. Right. Recourse for that. But I'm just talking about

[00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.620]
four letter words or any particular words that people of all ages, including little kids here

[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:05.760]
every day. I mean, it's so juvenile anyway. It's chucked in the news. Chuck Meyer whom again,

[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:10.020]
I thank for doing a super job filling in here yesterday as you 11 o'clock news. Mr. Porno,

[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:15.440]
the next sheriff of Broward County, L Goldstein's coming back with us at 11.05. Rick and Puts will be

[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.440]
here from two to six to seven. Can we say Puts on the airs and also banded Broward. It eat on the

[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:24.080]
corner, which could be sheriff Nick Hurricane hotline on sports talk with Joseph Acky tonight at

[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:30.780]
6.05 and the Larry, the high gold version of eight o'clock tonight. It's 11.06 at W.Y.O.D.

[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:37.180]
Is that something for me? I bet you that's copy, right? Thank you so much. Oh, our horses run

[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:40.960]
the night of pomp and a park Christmas list with the six hole. We even got the thing from the program.

[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:45.820]
Five to two favorite in the morning line is one two in a row. We have a horse, the W.Y.O.D. horse.

[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:50.480]
At a racing stable. It's the little thing they did the metal lands last year and the year before.

[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:56.100]
And gets the people involved in our horses one two races in a row. Great. And we're going to fix it

[00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:00.820]
up so he wins again tonight. I just did joke. It's just a little joke. Can we take some calls for

[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:05.560]
our goldstein because some of these people what before we do it when I'd also like to open it up a

[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:10.780]
little bit too. I have a condo committee who is a kind of committee. Yeah, you know these kind of

[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:17.540]
condo commando. I have a place in pomp and now I bought a set and one and I put a staircase to it

[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:23.560]
and this condo committee is run by Nazis. There are letters on the wall. You can do this. You can do that.

[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:28.140]
What did you expect when you moved to pomp and I wanted to know is that the way all of us who live here in

[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:35.060]
Florida have to live with you live in a condo punk. If you live in a complex not just in a condo. For

[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:40.360]
example, I had I moved to I don't remember the name of it on sunrise Boulevard back in the early

[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:44.880]
part of the year to Mayfair and I do take great pleasure mentioning the name of it again on a

[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:50.020]
day or Mayfair and I had my satellite dish. Well, I have a patio dish which the city of plantation

[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:54.640]
approved. I got a permanent. It took me like two years fighting with them. It's a patio umbrella

[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:59.740]
that covers up the dish. Okay. And in table it looks nice. You put it in the backyard. It looks like a patio

[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:06.300]
table. So I move into this new complex. I have it put in the backyard and Mayfair is a complex with

[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:13.140]
a board of governor, whatever the hall they call it. And it turns out that my neighbor, not old people,

[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:18.880]
young condo. I call them condo commandos and trained because the people who are like it where you

[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:22.080]
live now in Papano, when they were younger, they weren't any different. They wanted to wash

[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:27.200]
everybody. Rada got to her nose the size of their. So anyway, the first day that I move in there,

[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:31.260]
they're peering out the window and they're watching them putting this satellite, the patio dish.

[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:36.180]
And they put me through such tourists for a month and a half, two months I broke the lease and I

[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:41.460]
moved down. And I got my bread in my own house out in plantation acres. I got my patio dish up. No

[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:46.240]
problem whatsoever. I have my little, long piece of the earth out there. But when you live in a

[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:52.100]
complex, especially in this town, I don't know what it is. What what the nature of the people is,

[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:57.060]
who come to this town, but they just wanted to, it reminds me to say, I used to use all the time.

[00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:01.720]
It's not important in life that you succeed, but that your friends fail. So in this case, it's not

[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:06.700]
important that you be happy, but that your neighbors be miserable. Because it's busy parties. We've

[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:12.340]
had to lead them more on mail. And there are weird people. What I want to do because I now have a

[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:17.920]
second place, I'm thinking of renting six, oh, well, I won't give them the number. I'm renting the

[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:23.040]
other place to welfare recipients because I can rent any place I want if they're so nosy and they

[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:27.140]
want to continue declaring one, maybe people who listen, have their own techniques and fighting back,

[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:30.820]
you chickened out when you know, you just moved out. I want to know about people who,

[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:35.480]
I have a real work area. It's over. It might be in a box. Well, you mean, no, you're right. They

[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:40.000]
shouldn't kid you, but we want to get people who are listening, who can tell me how to wage for real

[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.180]
and warfare against my condo committee noxies. They must be counter attacks. Again, I'm going to

[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:50.860]
rent to these welfare recipients just to drive and crazy. But why are these people monitoring other

[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:55.840]
people's lives? I mean, they really are nosy, busy buddies. Because they have no life. They have no life.

[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.740]
That's that card I play all the time. I have no life. And the reason I play it is because it

[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:04.940]
really hit me of the people in this town or about 80% of the people is tired. And it goes back to

[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:08.600]
what you talked about in the first hour about the women getting the vicarious thrill from watching

[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:14.460]
the show. So whatever, people's lives so many of them are so shallow and so vacuous. And so they

[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:21.700]
have to get a vicarious thrill by injecting themselves unwantingly into somebody else's existence.

[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:26.240]
So they have to stick their nose into your mailbox or they have to stick your nose in. It's like

[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:31.580]
the woman who had the little what the hell was it on her door at the condo? Remember about a

[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:36.340]
year ago she had a thing on her door, some kind of a religious chauchky on the door or whatever

[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:41.500]
the hell it was. No, it was she was Christian. But I mean, whatever it was, the point is that they made

[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:46.480]
such a fuss and such a fear or they took her to the board of directors and they took her to court.

[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.220]
Who the hell cares? What the hell difference does it make? How does it affect their life?

[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:55.880]
You're right. Entertainment tonight, one of the other magazines shows did something on these

[00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:02.080]
fans who torment famous people. And it's the same thing. If you're not John Lennon and he can

[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:06.700]
write great lyrics, you can become famous and make the cover time magazine by killing John Lennon.

[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:13.120]
So these are the killers of creativity, of diversity. They want to urinate and everyone's parade

[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:17.900]
because there's no other explanation for it. And here, of course, I'm surprised that you're

[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:22.820]
a shantapist. What do you expect in poppanobe? Do you all have a townhouse? The median agent

[00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:29.740]
poppanobeach is death. It's true. It's amazing because I do meet nice people. Some, 20%.

[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:36.960]
80% are miserable, frustrated, nasty, hostile, bitter, and anything they can do to make your life

[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:41.100]
miserable and to be nosy and stick their nose into it because they have nothing going in their

[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:45.020]
life. And they just waiting to die. And people drive that way here. Haven't you know? Yeah.

[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:50.840]
Insane. I mean, come on. You just discovering these things? Welcome to Florida.

[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.800]
Sheriff. I'm going to spray them out. Yeah. The new sheriff, man, he's going to open up some special

[00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:00.180]
camps for some of these Yentas up. Well, that's what it's in them. Out in the Everglades, we can

[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:04.580]
open up a jug and a camp. We can entertain it. You can take care of the food arrangements. I

[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:09.220]
would be no problem. Okay, it's 11 after 11 at W. I. O. D. I'll go to tennis here. We'll take

[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:13.680]
some calls for that when we come back. We have an open line in day, 7 5 1. Broward, look at that.

[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:18.980]
Nothing in Broward. 524 W. I. O. D. That's that I tell you they're excited and brown. Oh, yeah,

[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:23.020]
they're ready to riot and Broward because of Sheriff Nick and the star out I. O. D. on the

[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:28.940]
star line 6 5 5 W. I. O. D. in Palm Beach. Let's talk about the max 11 of 15 at W. I. O. D. We

[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:34.260]
had those two lines on in Broward. They both dropped off. Must be Sheriff Nick's saboteurs. 524 W. I.

[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:39.180]
O. D. in Broward, Kendall. Yeah, how long are you today? Okay. Listen, I don't really have much from

[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:47.200]
Mr. Goldstein, but I just wanted to comment on Mr. Myers set in last yesterday. Yeah, Chuck.

[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:52.640]
All the people he's had on before he's the best. He's been he was. Chuck does a great job and he does

[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:57.140]
a weekend magazine on Saturday morning from 6 to 10. So it's not like he's in experience. He's a real

[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:01.120]
pro whether he's doing the news or a talk show. That's why I beg them. I said, listen, if you're

[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.880]
going to get somebody put Chuck in there and need to do the super job, he's great. He did an excellent

[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:10.420]
job. Also, I really want to bash some of these news stations for not getting on your bandwagon for

[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:15.860]
promoting Camilla's house. I mean, you're doing an excellent job. Well, I will say this. The

[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:19.940]
Harold finally came around. I want to thank Lorde Sandsaveto this morning in the Harold radio

[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:24.740]
column. She has a nice paragraph about it and we appreciate that. She also mentioned the show

[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:28.380]
we're doing at Charcoal's tomorrow. So yeah, sooner or later they jump on the bandwagon. Well,

[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:32.500]
they should take in the time about it, right? Yeah, you bet. Now, I want to thank Mr. Goldstein for

[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:40.360]
helping adults be adults at their own free will for keeping screw magazine going and fighting for

[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:46.860]
the rights of people who want to act like adults and enjoy that particular facet of their life.

[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:52.320]
Thank you. It's great. Thanks for calling. Happy holiday. Same thing. 1117 in WIWD. We have an

[00:44:52.320 --> 00:45:02.480]
open line of dates. 751 screw. 751. 9463. 751. And well, I'll go into it later. Here's a

[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:08.020]
bar. Right. Neil, your kind of committee comments made me think of a definition that I thought

[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:14.740]
was quite apropos. You ever heard what's the definition of a camel? What? The horse that was

[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:24.820]
designed by a committee. Yeah, it's true because you know, it's like stupidity loves numbers because

[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:31.260]
the really strong individual can stand on his or her own feet. But we people have to

[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:37.500]
be unified. It's really like a, it's really like a vigilante, linch mob. You have to get a lot of

[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:42.980]
people equal one person because the committees I've seen in this condo are really brain dead. I mean,

[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:49.140]
it's so sad. But typical typical. And I used to do those kind of shows. We did the thing. In fact,

[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:53.700]
a couple, I can't think of the name, but they were on 60 minutes in Tamarack. And they moved into

[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:59.620]
a new complex and in the bylaws, they've all got these 8 million pages of bylaws. No children

[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:04.500]
allowed. Okay. So the people who lived next door to them, the couple of next door, they had a pet

[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:10.720]
monkey or a son. I'm pretty sure it was a monkey. So come to find out that this woman got pregnant.

[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:14.200]
Okay. I mean, these things do happen. They even know if you're not planning. She got pregnant,

[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:20.640]
had the baby and the the tremendous hysteria that came about as a result. In fact, I had the

[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:26.620]
people on my show about four or five years ago. Just incredible. And the message that astonished me,

[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:32.460]
the message really was it's okay for the monkey to be next door, but you have a baby in your house.

[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:38.220]
And to us, that represents something horrendous, something a nightmare. This isn't New York,

[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:43.080]
where people are too busy. See, in New York, people don't have time. They step over dead bodies

[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:47.420]
in the subway because they have to because they're in a hurry because it works. It's a tremendous

[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:52.360]
pace. And they just don't have time. They don't want to take the time. They're just under enormous

[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:57.620]
pressure. Here, in fact, one of the funniest calls I ever had was from somebody who was leaving.

[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:01.800]
We get calls all the time. Oh, you hear them. I'm leaving town. We're finally getting out of

[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:06.340]
here or packing them. But anyway, this person was leaving because they couldn't stand the fast pace

[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:13.600]
here. And I cracked up. I mean, the fast pace. This is like a snail's pace here. These people are like

[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:20.960]
in slow motion or no motion. It's incredible. Okay. All the day lines open up. 751. Strange

[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:29.080]
on the phone, by the way. 751. 9463. Miami Beach disappeared. Alabama. You got it, man. How you doing? Okay.

[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:33.940]
Hey, I have a fight back for you. Good.

[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:45.760]
Red out. Red out to be a beautiful young lady. It has her start at home at condo daycare.

[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:51.840]
That'll get him. That's good. That'll fight back. Good. Thank you. Anyway, that's all I have now.

[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.480]
Or have you started filming porn movies in her apartment? Yes.

[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:59.980]
Into the drinking drape show. In one room. I probably have a committee meeting outside the window.

[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:06.940]
They would. They would. How is your vacation now? Outstanding. Great. Great time in Vegas. You can't be

[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.500]
the Vegas are living and breathing place. I'm still going into withdrawal because I spent almost

[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:15.800]
a whole week with people who were alive and having a good time. Even though people were losing,

[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:20.640]
we're still having a good time. They had a smile on their face. It was great. Pretty wide open.

[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:26.680]
You bet. Hey, listen. It's important to say happy holidays to you and my buddy and open

[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:31.920]
show be hitches. Listen. And I wanted to call him a douchebag. He's got all of his children.

[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:36.880]
He's a teacher down there. He's got all of them listening. There's supposed to be listening.

[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:43.420]
The Christmas music. So turn the channel. Yeah, get with it. Okay. Have a happy.

[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:48.940]
Hey, thank you. Thanks. You know, I was watching last night the previous. I'm very excited to

[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:53.100]
the bug. In fact, two nights ago, I wasn't here yesterday. So I didn't get a chance to mention two

[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:58.040]
nights ago. Godfather won, which I've seen 10,000 times was on. So I watched it again. Last night,

[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:03.080]
I saw little bits of Godfather too was also one last night. But anyway, I'm so excited about Godfather

[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:06.560]
3 and I happen to have Tuesday off Christmas day. So I'm going to go see it because that's when it

[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:13.600]
comes out. And I'm almost embarrassed to admit this. But I was watching some movie and I was

[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:19.580]
it was the scene in Godfather 1 where they're talking about the drugs and Marlon Brando is saying,

[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:23.320]
no, because the cops will come after us and I have to turn your deal down, Mr. Solazzo.

[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:28.460]
Bapapah. And not certainly drugs. I'm all against like anybody in their right mind should be.

[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:32.100]
But I'm talking about other things, whether it's sex or whether it's gambling.

[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:37.720]
The mafia isn't all bad. I mean, they do a lot of things that are very illegal and they do

[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:42.100]
eliminate people and they do a lot of very corrupting. But they're not all bad because they give the

[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:46.740]
public things that they want. Great. That the government wants to take away, and the church wants

[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:51.880]
to take away from them. But it's Tuesday. Like Vegas. When I'm out in Vegas, I don't think,

[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.300]
yeah, I wonder if the mob still owns this hotel or I wonder if this entertainer is on the payroll

[00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:01.640]
of the man. Who the hell cares? I'm having a good time. Isn't that why you love them? They

[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:05.640]
might haven't been there in a while, but I found a one of the most enlightened, liberated

[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:10.960]
parties. Absolutely. The first of herring is great. When you get off at the airport, which is one

[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:17.920]
of the wildest, most gentle, yeah, jammed up airport, chiphole airport in Amsterdam. Every kind of

[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:23.840]
human being from every corner of the earth is there. Oriental's black, white, big, tall, old young.

[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:28.940]
I mean, it's just it's like here. It's like a meeting place of the whole world. And nobody cares

[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:33.600]
what anybody else is doing. As you walk because of this walking city and you stay in the central

[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:38.200]
area and you walk for miles and you walk on the side streets. I've talked about this and the

[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:43.140]
aroma is coming from the various cafes that smoke and hash or potter. And again, like I said,

[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:47.620]
I'm not into drugs, but as long as it's not hard drugs and it's not hurting anybody, who the

[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:52.880]
hell cares? And sexually, whatever anybody wants, it's there. Nobody is judgmental. Nobody gives

[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.700]
a damn. And they don't have a massive drug problem. They certainly don't have a massive crime problem.

[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.840]
And people seem to get along great. They don't fit. And with all the different,

[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:06.940]
you know, reminds me again of this thing about world-class city. People in Miami, they say,

[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:11.560]
well, we're a world-class city. It's a joke. They don't know a world-class city. If it bit them on

[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:17.460]
the lip, okay? There is a world-class city. It is, you're as you're at years ago. I used to attend

[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:23.620]
a place. These definitely called the Wet Dream Film Festival in Amsterdam, the 70-71-72.

[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:29.180]
It was great. We know, but everything is assimilated. It was the first place I've been to where

[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:34.480]
really homosexuality was integrated. Panography was integrated. The drugs, they were

[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:40.600]
under the little floating boats. They were selling grass. People were growing it. It is really a place

[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:46.980]
where people mind their own business. And I found it absolutely wondrous. And one of the TV shows,

[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:51.300]
it might have been prime time, or not 60 minutes, had a piece of prostitution and asked them,

[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:58.840]
that they have to get loans for the pimps there. Totally victimless. I mean, it is absolutely the most

[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:05.520]
sane way of running prostitution here in Florida. Instead of taxing things, cleaning it up,

[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:13.200]
having inspections on the girls, we try to put it down, repress it. That doesn't make it go

[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:18.660]
away. It just makes it sleazy. Sleazy and dangerous. When will we realize it? When will the

[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:23.820]
mix of the world realize you're not going to control this? It will be integrated into some

[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:30.880]
corporate entity where taxes reach the city or the state. And there's a better level of education.

[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:35.660]
And this is a generalization, but to me it seems the better level of education, the better people

[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:40.040]
are able to cope with these things and be more mature. And our education is compared to the people

[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:44.380]
in Europe is a joke. Education people here can't even speak English, much less five, six languages.

[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:50.860]
Let me do a break. 25 after 11 alcohols, see this. Robo, 1128 at WID. Just want to mention,

[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:57.260]
I got a facts here from Beth Saxteen. And it says in the spirit of holiday season, Edward

[00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:02.400]
Assad from David's cafeteria and Clifford Stein from Jopetto clothing manufacturers,

[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:08.200]
will be sponsoring a holiday drive to raise money for Camille's house. And each business will

[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:13.500]
contribute $150 to begin the drive. It should be held tomorrow all day at David's cafeteria,

[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:22.880]
80 to 88 Biscayne Boulevard. And it'll begin at 1130 tomorrow morning. And it says 800 to a

[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:26.740]
thousand people will have an opportunity to contribute during the lunch and dinner hours. That's

[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:31.140]
customers. Jopettos will also be donating new clothing to Camille's house from their business

[00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:36.500]
at 425 East 10th Court in Halea. So that's another way for you to help Camille's house

[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:41.960]
to stop by and have lunch or dinner at David's cafeteria, 82 88 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami,

[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:46.200]
at 1130 tomorrow morning. I also want to thank you. You came up with a nice check for Camille's

[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:50.940]
house as you always do and the pledge to come up with some more. We haven't gotten any mail yet,

[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:57.720]
79,4445. And when the mail comes into day plus what you're going to help us out, it will be

[00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:02.280]
well over 80,000 on our way to over 100,000. There was a thing. There's another thing. Well,

[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:06.760]
you know, see this gets me back when you come on. It's always great. I enjoy it, but it bothers me

[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:10.540]
in one sense and that I start having the social conscience again that I'm trying to remove

[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:14.360]
right now. I mean, professionally. I mean, as a human being, I obviously have it,

[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:18.340]
but sitting here and talking about life like I look at the phone and like there's three four lines

[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:22.720]
open here. And it's not it's not a big deal because this audience, they're in vacuum heads, you know.

[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:27.840]
But the news story the last couple of nights has been that there are more homeless than ever before

[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:33.840]
and the public sympathy for them is lower than it ever has been before. And one of the things that I

[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:37.380]
hear once in a while, which is starting this year, I dump it. I don't let it even go on because I'm

[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:41.920]
tired of hearing it. People say, what's he's, how can he help out those wine, those drifters,

[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:46.400]
and all these stumbles? Oh, hi, how can he get involved in that? I'm not going to dignify that by

[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:51.740]
letting it even go on here anymore because I know what that is. When somebody says that, what they're

[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:56.180]
doing is they're rationalizing their own unwillingness to help out. They're only in difference to

[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:59.860]
human suffering because no matter what you want to label people and there are a lot of families

[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:03.220]
out there. Their women would little kids, their entire families who were done on their luck or

[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:06.900]
other streets, their veterans who put their lives on the line for the country who are out on the

[00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:11.420]
street sleeping on cardboard and on bus benches. But when you say to yourself, ah, they're wine

[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:16.560]
owes their drifters, it makes you feel better. It makes you feel less guilty that you have and

[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:21.280]
you're eating and you're doing well and you don't give it to anybody else. I was a boy. What kind of a

[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:25.240]
country can have millions of people sleeping in the streets and not even having a place to live?

[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:30.140]
It's amazing. I was watching something last night on an entertainment. They had a TV show

[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:38.020]
What the Cronkite was the voiceover and it was about Vietnam in 1970s shoot about Charlie

[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:44.520]
Company. And I watched the American soldiers referring to bodies dead people as gooks. They made

[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:50.300]
them not non-humanists like when you do body counts. So this way you don't have to deal with them

[00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:57.040]
as human beings as entities as breathing, breathing, eating creatures. That's what we do with the

[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:02.940]
homeless. If we can just make them into non people and visible people, then we can accept the bomb

[00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:08.440]
based syndrome that we are like New Delhi and we can have the six-year-olds begging. It's a

[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:13.320]
harry. I understand it's a defensive posture we do. Otherwise, you know, the dangers we can be

[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:19.040]
burned out and we feel imponent. But at least if you contribute some money, I know my contribution

[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:24.220]
is insignificant. But at least I can say, well, I'm doing something. It's like what's the concept

[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:29.180]
of tithing? It's giving, I like that. Even though I'm an atheist, it's giving something back.

[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:34.640]
I made a commitment to the American Civil Liberties Union yesterday that I'm going to be charging

[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:40.660]
my advertisers in screw. The hook is the S-foot services 2% of my gross, which is $7 million

[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:47.060]
when it charge 2% and contribute the money to the Civil Liberties Union. Why? Because if my

[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:52.420]
advertisers don't have the brains to have social responsibility, I will. And I like the idea of

[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:56.400]
knowing every time a hook turns a trip, some of the money is going to go for something that's

[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:00.280]
socially useful. You know, you talk about, I want to go back to what you were talking about with

[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:07.400]
Amsterdam and a lot of the cities in Europe. The usual song in advance in human cry used to be

[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:14.320]
here about communists and atheists and hedonism and tiled his crap in together. Although it is

[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:18.880]
interesting, communism is on a way out in the Soviet Union and there's a sexual revolution going

[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:23.740]
on in there. So where are you going? But the people in Europe for the most part are not atheists.

[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:27.680]
In fact, if you go into any of the major cities like Amsterdam, they're all of these big,

[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:32.180]
old cathedrals and churches and they're attended. They're well attended there. You go on a Sunday

[00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:37.120]
morning. They're full of people in there, but they don't look upon religion in the sane.

[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:44.300]
I don't even know how to describe it as so many of the religionists in this country. I mean,

[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:48.080]
it's the guilt trip religion in this country. It's like, you know, the old saying, if it tastes good,

[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:53.020]
it must be bad for you. If it feels good, it's evil. I was shocked last night to see this black

[00:57:53.800 --> 00:58:00.900]
leader here in Florida in Miami saying he didn't want to be questioned with what he said at the

[00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:07.300]
Williamson. This man must think he's out of Hitler. Does he think that it's it's and I don't know

[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:12.840]
what the issues are. But how dare he think he cannot be questioned. He's the equivalent of New

[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:18.140]
York's shopped. I mean, he looks like a demigod. I know that's another thing about this town that

[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:24.800]
makes a no-win situation is that it's like it's a professional ethnic thing in this town. And now we

[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:30.120]
have the thing in the situation with the Mercado case and the ride we had in or the disturbance,

[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:34.980]
whatever you want to call it in winwood, which I never even knew we had a division in winwood or

[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:39.620]
a town or a city or whatever it is. And so now it's the Puerto Ricans against the Cubans,

[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:44.720]
against the blacks, against the Anglos, against this one again. And it never stops. It never,

[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:51.960]
ever stops. And to think that we have a black boycott because the leaders in this community

[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:56.840]
didn't genuinely reflect when Nelson Mandela came here who was a as far as I'm concerned, a terrorist,

[00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:04.040]
fascist loving piece of crap and his wife who's accused of murder and all else, I don't understand

[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:08.100]
that. I mean, what are people thinking that because they annoy somebody as leader, whether it's

[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:12.940]
Louis Ferrican or Nelson Mandela, that if we don't genuinely reflect and we don't agree when

[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:16.620]
they bring the person to this community, right away we're going to boycott, we're going to do this.

[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:21.560]
I don't understand it. It's a self-defeating thing. Right, I see it as a Jew, whether they like

[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:26.560]
Olstein even though I'm an atheist, I am still clearly a Jew. I watch 60 minutes, two weeks ago.

[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:30.700]
And I'm impressed with that piece of journalism on that brick-phone incident. And I say,

[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:35.120]
well, hey, this where Israel has not done well, I'm not proud to be a Jew. Then I read the barber,

[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:41.200]
Waltz is Cheeto, and Don U, and the producer of 60 minutes and the professional Jews are upset

[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:46.880]
because it's Jewish doesn't make it always right. I understand that. And if you were a pro-Israeli

[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:51.160]
person and you said, out of you, you know, you have to have united front, you cannot get a real.

[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:58.180]
I say nonsense. I want Israel to be better than the barbarians. And I'm humiliated when I see Jews.

[00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:02.680]
So you have to be a thinking human being. You can't be a professional Jew or a professional black

[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:08.540]
or a professional Cuban or, and wear it on your sleeve all your life and just block out all the facts.

[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.820]
And that's what this town is filled with. I don't know when it's ever going to end. I don't have

[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:17.560]
much hope for it. But it just seems to keep happening over and over again. Waltz said, oh, in New

[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:23.600]
York City, there are actually some black leaders who defend the central park, jog is mugging. And

[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:29.520]
almost one, hard to be arrested for tantalizing. I mean, there are blacks who are criminals.

[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:34.480]
There are blacks who are dangerous. There are some Jewish lawyers who will rip you off. It's

[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:39.900]
a given. You're in radio. There are some nice people in radio. Some losers in radio. But you see

[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:45.480]
it in a complex way and said it is simplistic comic book mentality with either all a good Jew

[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:51.180]
or a bad Jew, all good black, bad black. That's where I become angry at human nature, rather than just

[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:56.160]
Florida. Well, we talked about the thing with the dentist and the shaleigh head on 60 minutes from

[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:01.200]
the ADA. And the first thing they want to do, cover up their own. The dentist, the doctors, the

[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:05.900]
lawyers, whatever it is, instead of cleaning their own house up, same with the cops. Oh, jeez,

[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:10.840]
you call us paid you to this, your anti-cop, you're a bad guy. We got more police corruption in

[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:15.340]
this town than you can check us. Stick it. We got police murdering other people, murdering innocent

[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:19.400]
citizens, taking justice into their own hands. Hey, if you speak out against the right away,

[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:23.380]
you're a bad guy. You don't you don't support good law enforcement. Right. When I'm told right

[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:27.640]
outside this radio station, there's a sheriff's office that has has practiced some really heavy

[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:35.320]
hand attacks on some on air radio personalities. That's shocking to me. I mean, it's inappropriate.

[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:41.420]
It's inappropriate. And the car I drive is. They know my car. They love me. North favor. Look,

[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:46.100]
thank God. 1137, out Goldstein is with us. The folks speaking of cars go over to Toyota,

[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:50.280]
Hollywood, Tulpatrick, Murray, you want W.Y. O.D. with Mr. Pornow, the next year of a

[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:55.100]
Broward County, L. Goldstein. You made a good point. We were just talking about Europe during

[01:01:55.100 --> 01:02:01.180]
the break. And when they took the wall down in Germany, the first one of the first things that

[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:05.060]
the people from East Berlin did was they rushed across what used to be the wall on the board of

[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:08.980]
there in the West Germany. They went to all the Pornow sections there where they have all the shops

[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:14.280]
in the movies and the theaters and the strip joints and whatever. And there was a major article in

[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.480]
one of the finance. I think it was in Forbes a few weeks ago, just about that, about what a

[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:22.400]
multi-billion dollar business it is now that all the people from East Germany are just

[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.280]
flocking in there because they've been suppressed so long and the same thing in the Soviet Union.

[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:29.880]
And I'm thinking we go in cycles. You know, we go through all these various cycles and the

[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:34.040]
pendulum keeps swinging back and forth and people are repressed for a long time. Then they all

[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:37.640]
want something very badly. And then all the right warriors start trying to repress it. That's

[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:43.840]
exactly what's happening in Russia. And the story, yes, they are an ABC section in Russia.

[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:48.000]
The freedom is breaking through now and you see all these people selling all these Pornow books.

[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.380]
And now, of course, the right wing is saying it's going too far. And you do. You do have a

[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:59.440]
pendulum swing when Patty and I were in Berlin two years ago. East Berlin was sterile and boring

[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:06.960]
and gray. And West Berlin, we went to a Pornow film which was good quality, a comfortable theater.

[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:12.020]
I remember small little thing. It was a place to put your soda. There was no ripple up. It was clean.

[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.620]
And that's what the people in East Berlin was stopped for. And that's where sex is a way of

[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:23.720]
manifesting individuality without hurting people. You and I in total agreement. So long as you

[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.260]
don't force yourself and somebody so long and a potential. And what I don't understand is how

[01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:33.140]
many examples doesn't take before the masses and maybe they already do. They just don't want to

[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:38.820]
wait. Understand the hypocrisy that you look at this swagger thing and a Jim Baker thing and Bob

[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:44.980]
Bauman and Marilyn. I maybe I can't say air. I don't want to make a blanket's generalization,

[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:48.900]
but I would say the overwhelming majority of the finger pointers, the ones who are screaming

[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:56.360]
allowed us. They're doing everybody inside, you know, behind closed doors. I think what we're

[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:02.480]
talking about is hypocrisy. You know, live and let live. Doesn't matter what your sexuality is,

[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:09.620]
I see the issue for me on children and rape is I clearly am on the side against both because I

[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:15.340]
don't believe a child of eight or ten can evaluate what's better for him or her. Rape takes the

[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:21.020]
choice and option from the other person. Sure, the bad. And there are some weird sexual activities

[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:26.520]
called water sports and things that are not my thing. But if you want to do it and you're doing

[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:31.100]
it in the safety of a home, the world of SNM is something I really haven't played around with.

[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:38.920]
But if two people want to sort of do like shane's the balcony and have the clue of the rough sex

[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:43.920]
without danger, who might have say no? Oh, that's so good.

[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.660]
You should have before. In fact, if the food doesn't show up pretty soon, we may have a little

[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:55.300]
lesson and going on here in the studio. What is he doing over there? Is he ordering out? Man,

[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:59.740]
under ordinary circumstances, we don't want to be pushing, but geez, these people are like,

[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:04.620]
and of course, Patty needs it. She's like, she's a way to pass out. How do you could probably

[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:08.580]
handle another half hour anyway without passing out? How do you fell down and she can't get up?

[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:13.340]
I think the dog fell down and can't get up. I met that woman who did that famous

[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:17.520]
person. I fell down and I can't get up. It's a writer in New York, they Michael Musto,

[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:21.260]
the writer for the village voice, and he had a birthday party and he had her coming. She's

[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:24.860]
really a very classy woman. I want to meet the old lady who does the clafting. The one

[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:29.520]
that's in bed where she claps and let the TV goes off. She's just as good. In fact, she already

[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:34.980]
fell down and can't get up and place you that a clamp. Mobile and Hollywood. Are you gone?

[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:41.680]
Long gone. Okay. Popped O'Beach is also gone. Well, we've been keeping these people on

[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:46.820]
this restaurant. They don't know where they're at. Miami. Is there anybody left on these lines?

[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:53.500]
Boy, you people are brutal. Miami Beach. Good morning. Yes, sir. Thanks for your patience.

[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:58.080]
Well, long long ago. Please acknowledge it. It is an interesting show and I'm listening

[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:02.720]
today because it is a show with conscience. The ow? Yes. I just dropped something down and you

[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:08.200]
should live and let live. I agree with you, but I think most people want the except corruption

[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:12.640]
or restlessness because they feel that if you let them get away with their corruption,

[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:16.440]
they've got to let you get away with theirs. You've read laser corruption. But yeah, so in other

[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:21.880]
words, it's okay. I had at this point a question, but I just wanted to recall a funny story

[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:26.460]
between me. The first time I ever heard of you or anything to do with you, within the harbingen

[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:32.360]
Chinese restaurant, I'm up a Broadway at least, but on this street, nearly 60s. We're a

[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:37.300]
Columbia. And we're sitting in just eating Chinese food and somebody comes walking down the aisle

[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:44.060]
saying, screw, pleasure, screw, pleasure. We had no idea what the hell was going on. And it turned

[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:49.020]
out that they were selling those magazines. That was a good old days when I could go back to them.

[01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:54.160]
It was kind of funny. And of course, I was told about... Is it like Dem Sim? Dem Sucks.

[01:06:54.160 --> 01:07:02.640]
Yeah, okay. Well, and my friend Tony California says it not well, but we're in Miami Beach. We

[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:07.620]
have our own property with the chief of police. And it's now imposing his own morality closing down.

[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:12.100]
Talk is pleasant. He's sending down letters. He's sending out letters now,

[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:17.540]
wants to with the approval of the City Commission to the employers of people who arrested

[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:24.260]
drug-related charges. So we're fighting it here. And I had a question to ask you. I'm

[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:30.380]
coordinated for Libertarian Party and Dick Knight. And I heard through some great fine that you are

[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:35.720]
connected with Libertarian Party, we're seeking their help. Yes, I expect to get the designation to

[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:44.780]
be running for Sheriff on your political affiliation. I'm going to run anyway, but what better candidate

[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:53.480]
for you than me? And so it's perfect because I am a Libertarian. And the question is, I know you've

[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:57.580]
got one winning candidate in Alaska. You're now going to have your second winning candidate. You're

[01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:03.080]
going to have a sheriff in Browell County. And we can make some changes just by ignoring the

[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:09.560]
stupid laws. I want to put the manpower where it counts against the criminals, not against the

[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:14.600]
topless clubs and the Pono shops and the Rock lyrics. I am not a music critic.

[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:20.340]
New federal legislation just went down on saying that any drug paraphernalia is now a

[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:24.460]
selling of it is a federal effect. The rest of this is getting a greater effect. It's

[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:28.460]
frightening. Neil and I have been talking about a lot of things and I was watching something on

[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:35.440]
the PBS station here in this area that fascinated, fascinated, peace, how polygamy,

[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:41.320]
how polygamy was really an extension and expression of religious, of someone's religious

[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:46.800]
religiosity. And suddenly the other religious people who may be just as nutty because I think

[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:52.020]
there are some Roman Catholics who are obviously awfully crazy values telling other religious people

[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:58.840]
what's acceptable and not. Polygamy should be covered. And then a hundred years ago in order to

[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:04.860]
be allowed into the United States, they had to give a polygamy. But the history of polygamy is

[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:10.240]
that age-old history of repression and oppression against points of view we don't like. Whether

[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:16.740]
it's sexual or ideological, it's upsetting and I see why Neil becomes cynical because I can see it.

[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:18.980]
I can see it in my own and here I am for a couple of years old.

[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:23.480]
Question for Neil is something I do when I quote fraudulent lies down here and I try not to.

[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:28.380]
I just don't even get the hell out of here if it don't view it. But I don't ask what other

[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:31.460]
people are doing. People say, well, you can't do anything. You can't do anything. You know,

[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:36.960]
they can't do anything. I say, excuse me, what are you doing? Forget everybody out. It's what you're

[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:42.020]
doing towards liberty and freedom while you are here in this planet. Well, you know, that sounds great.

[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:44.940]
Listen, it sounds great on the surface. We're really ideologically.

[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:49.880]
The approach of what people come in here all day long. I can't jungle with it. Party, I can't do this.

[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:54.220]
I can't approach to that. And what difference does it make? I say forget it. What are you doing?

[01:09:54.500 --> 01:10:00.180]
Using an individual. Well, well, if you can get to one person and as long as you're doing something,

[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:04.240]
you then will influence other people. Oh, no, I don't disagree with that. I mean, I'm not saying

[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:07.900]
that everybody should just throw their arms up and ear and give up. I mean, heaven forbid we should do

[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:12.880]
that. But you are doing that as a nation, but we're looking for somebody else. But you have to put

[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.060]
your energies in the areas where you really believe you can be affected. Like every year I do this

[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:20.720]
thing where we raise money for the Camila South in a homeless because it's a cause I believe in.

[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:24.720]
And yeah, we're going to raise over 100,000, but it's still a drop in the bucket. But at least,

[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:28.760]
it's something. At least it's directing some of your energies in a positive way and something

[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:34.460]
tangible that you can put your finger on as opposed to the wild blind idealism of the 60s. A lot of

[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:38.760]
us used to cling to where we're going to change mankind. And we're going to, and especially in this

[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:43.200]
area, you're not going to change mankind. It's like trying to talk to a rocket. Isn't going to happen.

[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:47.520]
They told me that when I first came here 15 years ago, when I was a wild-eyed idealist,

[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:51.100]
and I thought I was going to really make big changes here. We were going to do this. And

[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:55.620]
forget it. It's not going to happen because the people don't care. You can lead a horse to water,

[01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:59.640]
but you can't make him drink. And you can't force feed the public. If they don't care,

[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:03.280]
you can't force him to care. And I've learned that the hard way of believing.

[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:09.260]
The masses have never affected it. But you see, I think what people like, you

[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:13.720]
have called in and kneeled myself. By the way, I'm not in charge of if you need any help,

[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:17.020]
we will contact the party. Please thank you. Definitely.

[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:22.980]
But reasonable objectives. I think if we don't do that, we wipe ourselves out. And I think what

[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:26.580]
happens is when you believe in something you think you're going to go all the way with it.

[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:31.300]
If you make that small gesture, that small step, for me 22 years of publishing screw,

[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:37.020]
I have not been a radical change in American life. But every week that screw came out,

[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:40.740]
my near-existence was a rebuke against the Jerry Boil.

[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:44.100]
Give it to me. But you were making a comment, but you were also entertaining people.

[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:47.500]
Yes. Through magazine. And you said this yourself before. You were given a public

[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:51.820]
what they wanted. Exactly. It was juvenile. It was sophomore. Absolutely. But it also had a

[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:56.500]
message to it. That's what I do. That's what I do every day. I entertain people. I have a message

[01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:01.420]
to it. But to try to sit here and pontificate and get your blood pressure up and carry on and

[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:05.660]
think that you're going to change people's attitudes and force feed them. Forget it. It isn't going

[01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:10.020]
to happen. Bottom line we're in show business. And if you are not entertaining people,

[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:16.980]
you're right. You are failing. School magazine is not a polemic or sexual freedom.

[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:22.980]
It's near-existence is a statement. And bottom line, let's leave the reader happy, give him some

[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:32.980]
good value. That's good enough for me. Exactly. 1152. And some BLT's, no doubt, or toast or whatever

[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:37.520]
they got. Got some diet soda for me. And the best part of it is you can be witness. I'm not

[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:43.060]
touching anything. How do you like that? Oh, hash browns. Look at that. That's enough for

[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:48.600]
all what's paddagon A. Excellent. Anyway, we've reached a milestone. We need a little sound effect.

[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:55.540]
Well, that could be it or maybe. Anyway, Mr. Disney just came in. Now he already donated as he

[01:12:55.540 --> 01:13:01.260]
did last year $1,000 personally for Camilla Sounds. Now here is a check from WIOD and our friends

[01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:07.200]
the coast next door for another $1,000 for Camilla Sounds. Which puts us that's a very important

[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:15.700]
donation because it puts us over the $80,000 mark even before the mail comes in today. $80,444.85.

[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:19.980]
In fact, maybe Murray Kim. Would you do me a big favor, Murray? I mean, you already do a

[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:24.480]
civic. Can you do the erasers right there and the front is their chalk? There's the chalk on the

[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:28.500]
other row. The chalk is all gone. Okay, we'll get a piece of chalk. George, bring a piece of

[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:33.080]
chalk from the other one. Put it up because it's a real milestone. Oh, look at that little sausage,

[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:40.100]
little hand. Yeah, now we're cooking. Oh boy, I haven't seen a little us. Man, this man is smiling

[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:47.040]
from ear to ear now. The eating sheriff, huh? You know the sheriff in the car spots, the Georgia,

[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:50.900]
the guy in Georgia, the big fat sheriff that's in all those cars. But you could be like him and put

[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:55.700]
the uniform on. The only problem is it's going to cost the taxpayers a fortune to clothe this man.

[01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:59.140]
Can you imagine the sheriff's outfit that we're going to have to put together for you? We're going to

[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:05.200]
cost us millions. Is that my con, by the way? I don't think so. I don't hear it. What were you saying?

[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:09.060]
I'm going to feed myself with my own money. Any calls from Nipthal on the Broward line?

[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:14.700]
Oh, do we? Let's see. Let's take a brown-broward call from... Look at that. Six is North Miami.

[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:21.040]
Oh, four is Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Oh, back in the 60s. Do you remember a movie called It Happened

[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:26.200]
in Hollywood? I made it. You made that? I made it. I played the King of the Philistines. If you

[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:31.840]
watch The Handway Through The Film, you'll see me involved in sexual and explicit sexual activities.

[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:36.240]
I was a projectionist back then. That was an incredible thing. No one knows it's a while. The film was

[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:41.660]
made by West Craven who has become famous. This is where we would glory a letter that you denied.

[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:48.020]
This was Acrobatics Act. Yeah, but it's a it's a it's a it's a screw film.

[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:52.000]
Huh. I made it. So funny movie. We would release it, but we can't find a print.

[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:55.960]
See, back then, you know, when the movie theaters used to show when they used to have

[01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:01.080]
4.0 theaters, I ran 35 millimeter 4.0 films in one theater and the other theater was regular.

[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:05.240]
I'll Hollywood film. That's funny. That's a fuse. And it was great.

[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:09.840]
It was great. Did any of the patrons ever get confused to wind up at a wrong one?

[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.740]
Half a time. All the time. Did they ever come running out of speech and probably unlikely?

[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:21.400]
They probably stood in at a long time. What do you like better? Do you like what

[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:24.380]
you're saying here? It was more peaceful. But I really haven't found great restaurants.

[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:28.560]
I'm a Neil's giving me a list. I want to check them out. But L.A. has better food for me.

[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:31.900]
Yeah, you really need great restaurants. In fact, that'd be the best thing that happened for you.

[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.400]
I'll keep the list to myself. It will be to lose from your point. But when

[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:39.040]
when torn was brought into the home with the B.C.R.s and the video tape and everything,

[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:45.160]
do you think like back in the 60s, you know, even going to see an Andy Warhol film was considered

[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:49.800]
pornographic. It's a movie. But since it's been brought into the home, do you think it's

[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:54.940]
that one? Kind of like the down slide. I mean, it's a trivial point, but I don't know.

[01:15:55.380 --> 01:16:01.180]
Well, it did help the sale of video deaths. It was appointed X-rated represented 50,

[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.480]
60 percent of films. That was Hollywood films of burgeoning and they're more

[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.840]
audio Hollywood films is down to about 15 percent. But it's a multi-billion dollar business.

[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:13.520]
Okay, now, not no, the lovely, the not so pornographic Elaine Ettoire, depending upon who's

[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.740]
looking, I guess. I guess if you're over the age of 100, she's really something special.

[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:21.240]
And Lens got the new and W.I.O.D. news. We'll be back with Al Goldstein and Patti and the

[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:28.960]
dog and food at 1205. We're going to change the number up there. 80,444. We thank Mr. Disney and

[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.720]
company. And don't forget Rick and Puts a two sports talk at 605. Hank Goldberg eight tonight.

[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:40.000]
You're right. 1207 at W.I.O.D. and we got Al Goldstein here. Happy faces in a studio.

[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:46.460]
Even the dog is quiet. Is it not inside? She's on a four eating. Everybody's eating except me.

[01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:50.900]
I want you to verify that. I'm not eating. I'm really impressed. Now we had Rick with what

[01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:54.960]
I'm on lunch. That was a prep was I was only this. I get two minutes. I was at the American

[01:16:54.960 --> 01:17:00.500]
plan. Wasn't it? Was it a European plan? If you eat more than this, I'm going to be I'm going to

[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:06.220]
carry a elbow for Nick Navarro. That's how it's open. Neil left the room when he came back. He had

[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:12.180]
grease on his chin. I did. Yes. I took that check into his vest.

[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:16.440]
Drooping out of your quenching vest. You are so full of cramp. It is coming out for somebody

[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.940]
as skinny as you are. Man, you are really full of it. You must hide it very well.

[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:24.520]
It shakes it though. Exactly. Anyway, I wonder where she got it from. We have an open line

[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:29.640]
of dates. 751 W.I.O.D. Al Goldstein is here. We're solving all the problems in the world.

[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:33.740]
We're going to turn the world into Sodom and Gamora or at least part of that. He's going to be

[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:37.220]
sure. And let me say it again at the thing at Charquels tomorrow. We're going to be doing a show.

[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:41.880]
Church with Al Goldstein. Al will be there with a dozen. A dozen shirts. Okay. A dozen?

[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:47.200]
I don't have a consent more though. I have a 12. I'm just giving you a heart. Okay.

[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:51.680]
No, but for the next one, we do our thing. It's called around the fourth of January between now and

[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:56.220]
then. If you can give me a whole bunch more of these, we can raise money for Camino's house with

[01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:00.880]
these. These are sharp. These are beautiful. Al Goldstein for sure for the big flag.

[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:05.700]
I see anybody wearing it. If you still look like that, you might have a fight in

[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:09.220]
the ocean. So I'll tell you, look almost human. Little like Charlie Manson, but not bad.

[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:13.020]
Maybe that's what we could use for sure if it brought us Charles Manson. He's not doing anything

[01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:19.280]
productive. We have an open line at Broward 524 WIOD South Miami. Hey, how are you doing?

[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:24.980]
Okay. I don't mind to hear you on the radio. I really enjoy when you come on the show.

[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:30.780]
Thanks a lot. Thank you. Listen, the channel 10 had an exclusive last night. I don't know if you

[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:37.360]
called it out about the Broward chair office having re-separated investigations on sexual misconduct.

[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.060]
I cannot believe it. It's unbelievable. I mean, next days are really numbered.

[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:48.940]
Besides having so many of his cases reversed because of the impromptu seizures of votes and stuff.

[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:53.240]
Right. And the thing with his wife, there's some scrutiny going on on her.

[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:59.140]
It is really, he really runs the worst sheriff's office in the United States.

[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:04.700]
And again, I know nothing about law enforcement, at least know what's legal and illegal.

[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:10.720]
And the way to fight crime is to get rid of Nick. I mean, fight crime at the first place, the sheriff's

[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:15.020]
office. Well, I wish you all the luck. Thank you very much. I hope it works out. You know, you said

[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:21.220]
something earlier that made I've heard a number of times talking with associates of mine about the

[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:27.720]
homeless about saying how they're homeless because they want to be homeless. Oh, yeah, that's

[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:32.260]
the biggest crock I've ever ridden my life. Yeah, it's unbelievable. I mean, anyone who thinks that

[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:37.220]
people want to live that existence. And maybe there are a few questions. But you know, there are

[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:41.540]
some people who have been out of who are, thanks to Reagan, especially, they put, they opened up

[01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:45.300]
the mental institutions and they put a lot of people out on the streets because they cut off the

[01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:49.780]
funding. And so there are a lot of those people who are confused, who are mentally unbalanced,

[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:54.960]
I mean, who don't know any better, don't know any other way of life and just insist on perpetuating

[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:59.580]
that. But that's a very small minority of the people we're talking about. Exactly. That's another

[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:04.920]
one of the tactics that's used just like the stereotypes, the winos, the drifters. Just keep using

[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:08.600]
those terms and it eases your conscience. And then you don't have to worry about it. It does,

[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:15.000]
it gives them a, if they have any conscience or any, it makes it easier to their conscience. So

[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.100]
they don't really feel guilty about not helping a homeless. It gives them an excuse not to do it

[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:24.600]
because in their mind, they're right. And that's why you bet. You know, it doesn't make any sense.

[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:28.860]
Well, we're doing great. Even in a recession year when money is very tight and people are just

[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:33.200]
they're not spending a lot of money because they don't have it. We're over 80,000 now. We're

[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:37.580]
going to go over 100,000 by the 15th of January. And I think our people are ready to be

[01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:41.920]
commended for that. Thanks to you. Thanks a lot. Listen, one last thing. Yeah. I'm not,

[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:46.900]
a couple had a Ted couple had his documentary last night on sex and yeah, we were out of

[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:52.180]
referring to him. Yeah, it was incredible. They had a conservative party member, you know,

[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:57.640]
a lady says that they were talking about how a lot of the explicit magazines and videotapes

[01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:02.100]
are more available. And she says she says this is terrible. We should not allow

[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:07.140]
people to get their hands on this type of stuff. And I looked on my friend Dave. I said,

[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:13.140]
doesn't that sound familiar? I mean, here it is in Russia. They're talking some of the same

[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:17.860]
language that people here are talking about. That people shouldn't have accessibility to some of

[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:23.460]
these tapes and magazines and things like that. And it's unbelievable when you look at it around

[01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:29.500]
the world like that, that they're sounding a lot more like some of the people here are sounding.

[01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:34.240]
Let me give you a bottom line and that's from my perspective as an atheist, which is so many

[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:38.620]
religious, so many religions and religious leaders try to make this feel that we're guilty of sin.

[01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:45.860]
And when you're in the fighting of sin, anything goes including books, what the people did,

[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:51.660]
censorship. And then you become like a chomaine in the eye at whole that you become a true believer

[01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:56.180]
who will destroy the enemy because you know long or a person. And I don't want to give you a

[01:21:56.180 --> 01:22:01.740]
heavy philosophy. It's Florida and you little throw up and you guys want to hear it. But the bottom

[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:09.500]
line is it's good to look at it to realize for me that I'm glad I'm a panographer because at least I'm

[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:13.720]
in favor of our humanity, rather than the suppression of our humanity. Thank you.

[01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:15.120]
Thank you. Exactly. Thank you.

[01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:20.540]
1213 to WIOD. We have an open line in date 7519463. How's breakfast?

[01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:29.020]
It was nice. It was very tasty. But I'm not going to tell you because Jeff from

[01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:33.040]
Petzelov wanted to bring food also. And I told you or you tell him no way.

[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:37.740]
Because you are now you don't look quite as rotund as you were last time. Yeah.

[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:43.140]
And it actually shows which is a miracle because 12 out of four digits isn't that much.

[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:48.180]
I did a place I go to on the land of full of our bananas and they have great food.

[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:53.160]
The problem is the portions are too big here because a lot of the I think a lot of people

[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:57.660]
here in Miami they can. But now that you live in Pompo-no-B, you can go to the early bird.

[01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:03.720]
Okay. Good. And they feed you little tiny portions for a bird and the price is about the same.

[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:07.320]
It's great. It's nice that the Schicksal-Elita June there. Exactly.

[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:09.280]
Isn't the way it should be? It'll fit right in.

[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:11.600]
Robo comp is back and better than ever.

[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.460]
Hi, this is Mari Povitch. We're wishing you a happy Hanukkah.

[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:17.620]
Okay, I love the way it says it. 1217 to WIOD.

[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:20.380]
Now I've got good news for you folks. It's lighting up a cigar.

[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:24.220]
Thanks to Bob Weaver. You know, you have Weaver the Weatherman at Channel 4 to thank

[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:27.180]
you. He's a super guy. That's wonderful.

[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.400]
And he's Jewish too, so I can't be all bad. Is he fat?

[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.540]
A little bit. Because he's not fat. He's a little ugly.

[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:33.580]
What does Waste like 38?

[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:37.060]
I don't know what Bob Weaver's Waste is. How the hell do I know?

[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:40.200]
It's not my type, okay? I'd check Waste over there.

[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:43.780]
Now when these guys come in here, then I can tell you what their Waste is, okay?

[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:47.180]
When they ever come to town. When people talk to me about if somebody is handsome,

[01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:49.580]
and I'd always say if the Waste is 34 less than handsome.

[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:53.260]
No. You have so many. You never saw a skinny people in a

[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:55.880]
ugly. I always want. Oh, come on.

[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.400]
Larry King. What's his Waste?

[01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.520]
No, but he's sitting there. I think he wrote tonne.

[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.200]
Huh? He wrote tonne.

[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:02.960]
Johnny. Larry King is wrote tonne.

[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:04.400]
I think he's got a fat tummy.

[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:06.120]
You're crazy.

[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:07.000]
This is absurd.

[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:08.340]
Johnny Holmes.

[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:10.160]
Oh, 32-inch Waste.

[01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:12.080]
He was. Now what did you say was handsome?

[01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:13.520]
I think he was handsome.

[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.300]
Do you agree with that?

[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:16.120]
Patty is.

[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:18.400]
If I'm your finger, look at that. There's the hash browns.

[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.900]
Just came up again. I can't believe it.

[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:21.500]
If John Holmes was handsome.

[01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:22.720]
Well, he would be the way he was built.

[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:23.500]
Like you might know.

[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:24.120]
No, I'm too good at that.

[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.740]
Forget about that. You're off his skinny.

[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:28.440]
First of all, nobody wants to be built like an elephant number one.

[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:31.180]
That was beyond anybody's reasonable taste.

[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:31.640]
Number one.

[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:32.760]
And...

[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:34.360]
Kelvin.

[01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:35.360]
Neil.

[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:35.880]
Yeah.

[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:38.180]
How about you going to dignify that with a response?

[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:39.380]
I just ignore from the way.

[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:40.940]
When you're Jewish and that's your fantasy,

[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.480]
you're really desperate. I tell you that.

[01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:44.500]
Because the rabbi had a sharp knife.

[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:45.720]
Yes, Kelvin.

[01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:46.580]
How are you?

[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:47.120]
Okay.

[01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:48.340]
I didn't hit that question.

[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:50.740]
Um, car for a couple of reasons.

[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.760]
Well, that's good. Usually we have one reason

[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:53.760]
is usually good enough.

[01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:56.420]
Uh, it's a two good ones. I've got the Kuna'a's house.

[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.460]
All these life cards won't give money.

[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:00.440]
So, look about it. I'm just trying to get a question.

[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:01.420]
I don't know what you're going to get out of it.

[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.480]
I'm just really going to go out on them.

[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:04.660]
So, give them money and...

[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:06.120]
Lifeguard suck, Kelvin.

[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:08.380]
Literally and figuratively. Don't ever forget it.

[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:09.640]
Yeah, but what about the money?

[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.060]
That's what I'm talking about.

[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.160]
And the other one is...

[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:14.580]
It's the infuriated house.

[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.100]
Well, that's great.

[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:17.860]
I would get out the cart and play it.

[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:19.720]
But he's just, uh, I can't handle it.

[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.240]
Yeah, you know, he says, he wants me off.

[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:21.700]
He wants me off.

[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.280]
I don't know how to come on myself.

[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:24.100]
Why is that?

[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:26.180]
He says you went to the last room already.

[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:27.060]
You know, he's being a baby.

[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:27.960]
Just see if he's a butcher.

[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:30.800]
Well, you know what? We'll have a real good time without him, Kelvin.

[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:32.140]
You just show up in your underwear.

[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:33.080]
We'll have a great time.

[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:34.000]
Okay.

[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:34.800]
We'll go.

[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:35.020]
All right.

[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:36.980]
Uh, purple would be nice.

[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:38.340]
I think, uh, I'll have to go.

[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:39.700]
In fact, we got a whole bunch of Zuba caps

[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:40.720]
and pants we're giving away.

[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.180]
Tomorrow, so you might go away well dressed.

[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.000]
Okay, Kelvin?

[01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:43.640]
I'll do what I can do.

[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:44.220]
See you tomorrow.

[01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:44.760]
All right.

[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:45.900]
From a brown line.

[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:46.420]
Come on, Neil.

[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:46.940]
I want to get that.

[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:48.100]
That was a brown line.

[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.800]
Oh, that's that's that's your constituent.

[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:51.440]
See right there.

[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:53.180]
Zuba pants and caps and underwear.

[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:56.460]
I don't understand how long have you had that place in

[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:59.680]
Pompano Beach two years and you still don't understand where you are.

[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:00.560]
I'm amazed.

[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:01.900]
You don't sit back.

[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.700]
I mean, I know you've got the dog in your shoulder.

[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.600]
I love what people hear you.

[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:05.880]
Okay.

[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.920]
If you want to be the sheriff, you can't be a meek.

[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.020]
West Palm Beach.

[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:10.080]
I need a favor.

[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:10.820]
You great.

[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.200]
Jessica's vacation.

[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:13.060]
Outstanding.

[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:17.280]
The uh, uh, uh, Mr. Goldstein.

[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:17.820]
Hi.

[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:18.460]
Hi.

[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:22.860]
You had an old friend, uh, Dr. Tony.

[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:24.000]
Otoni Grant.

[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:24.580]
Yeah.

[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.100]
Well, my love interest.

[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:28.220]
Tony Grant was very big in LA radio.

[01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:31.760]
She had a book on feminism, which she basically repudiated.

[01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:35.340]
Because she felt that women should be taken care of by men.

[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:38.200]
And Tony and I will love us and live together for about eight months.

[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:42.080]
Yeah, but what I understand when you told a story once before

[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:44.060]
did she deny it even knowing you?

[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:48.720]
Yeah, but then she quit radio and she quit the station in Los Angeles

[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:50.520]
because I had everything on tape.

[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.000]
I had evidence at collaboration.

[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:53.880]
And she retired from radio.

[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.600]
LA wasn't big enough for her and I.

[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:59.040]
Tony's actually a great just as a bit of hypocrisy.

[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:02.400]
She would not admit that she went to bed with me or that she

[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:05.060]
wasn't as an emerald love to be hung upside down.

[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:06.280]
And everything was on tape.

[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:08.940]
I think it made her a more diverse radio personality.

[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:13.200]
Well, I tell you, I knew her many, many years ago in high school.

[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:13.800]
Pretty lady.

[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:15.680]
I know what she had to Jewish name.

[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:16.240]
What was her name?

[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:20.620]
She not only changed her name.

[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:22.240]
She had a family change in it.

[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:24.360]
And people never realized she was a Jew from a burning.

[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:25.280]
The Nile.

[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:27.380]
Yeah, but it's him if you're a Jew, you're a Jew.

[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:27.700]
Right.

[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:30.940]
He sees shorting the name for a marquee point of view.

[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.160]
But if you're a Jew, you're a Jew.

[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:32.960]
That's what you accept.

[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:33.600]
Like I'm sure.

[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:37.020]
Yeah, I mean, Gilbert Garfield and I are Jews and people know it, right?

[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:37.740]
Right.

[01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:39.460]
But the same thing happened to me.

[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:43.000]
I ran into her 20 years after I finished school with her.

[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:43.800]
And I knew her too.

[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:47.260]
And she wouldn't even talk to me when I tried to talk to her.

[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:49.880]
Well, in your case, she was right.

[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:51.100]
But in my case, it was wrong.

[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:53.400]
No, no, I'm just doing darn rickhoods and tricks.

[01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:54.560]
I know you're good.

[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:55.080]
Thanks, Ella.

[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:55.740]
Thank you.

[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.580]
OK, 22 after noon.

[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:58.820]
How is Tony doing, by the way?

[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.140]
She's quick radio.

[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:03.180]
She's got a new husband and no one has heard from her in two years.

[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:05.660]
I did a show with a public service then.

[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:07.180]
I drove her out of radio.

[01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:09.060]
You know, Tom Tom, like, is I did a show.

[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:12.480]
And then she tried to get him fired for putting me on.

[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:15.060]
And ultimately, two days later, she had to quit the show.

[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:21.220]
It's not that she went, that she and I were lovers, that the pandemic

[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:22.260]
said she denied it.

[01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:24.380]
I felt I was good enough to do with.

[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:26.860]
I'm good enough to at least be acknowledged for doing it.

[01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:28.040]
Doesn't that make sense?

[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.820]
But you know John Holmes clearly.

[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:31.780]
I'm so ministerial.

[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:32.920]
It's almost like not doing it.

[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:33.220]
Are you?

[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:33.880]
No, seriously.

[01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:34.860]
Are you joking?

[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:35.560]
I am a science queen.

[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:36.500]
I don't forget about that.

[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:37.400]
Festive me.

[01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:38.160]
That's a good test.

[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:42.480]
OK, that whole size, but you really thought that he was a handsome man.

[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:44.780]
Yeah, I said a fitting.

[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:45.580]
I interviewed him.

[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:48.020]
Take him to an optometrist and get the man some glasses.

[01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:51.880]
OK, he was always one of the roses looking people who was ever

[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:52.920]
on the face of the earth.

[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:54.460]
He was I like home.

[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:56.540]
I call him John homelike.

[01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:01.160]
I covered his murder trial for Playboy, which he was acquitted of those

[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:01.760]
former murders.

[01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:03.820]
And I thought he I like playing.

[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.780]
And I would have given him a right on my figure.

[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:09.940]
I never would have been rejected by a woman if I had his.

[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:10.620]
A coach.

[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:11.860]
Thank God for Peter North.

[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:15.360]
That's all I can say 12, 1227 at W.I.D.

[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:17.500]
So you're coming by and charcoal us tomorrow with the t-shirts

[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:19.040]
because you have to be free food for everybody.

[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:19.560]
Yes, good.

[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:19.980]
Good.

[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:20.400]
Good.

[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:21.700]
I want to find a place.

[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:22.920]
A few wings a little bit.

[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:25.540]
If I get the early, will they get a shine and more food?

[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:27.020]
Finger food, as they say.

[01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:29.420]
I'd rather have like, you know, armed food.

[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:31.340]
Well, they got that there too.

[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.180]
OK, we'll provide you with whatever you want.

[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:36.040]
Anyway, I just want to mention we'll be doing our show tomorrow at the brand

[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:38.760]
new charcoal is just not the commercial on university drive.

[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:43.300]
The address is 5426 North University Drive.

[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:44.740]
And we've got all kinds of stuff.

[01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:45.940]
We're going to be drawing for free.

[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:48.800]
Panasonic car phone courtesy of Gold Coast Cellular.

[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:52.960]
We've got naturally the tapes and the t-shirts and also a small select

[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:56.780]
number of the L Goldstein for Sheriff of Broward t-shirts, which are beautiful.

[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:00.560]
We've got a pair of tickets to the Paul Simon concert to be given away courtesy

[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:01.780]
of Fantasma Productions.

[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:05.120]
We've got a whole bunch of Zuba pants and hats courtesy of the dolphins.

[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:08.300]
Dinner certificates from Charcoal's and Pizza Lock dinner from

[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:11.660]
from Frascades, it's had in restaurant, a pair of matching lamps from design

[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:15.100]
lighting and a free buffet and a partridge in a pear tree.

[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.320]
What the hell more could you want than that?

[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:17.680]
When's the Paul Simon concert?

[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:18.640]
When's the Paul Simon concert?

[01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:19.700]
You don't ask me quite.

[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:20.540]
What the hell do I know?

[01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:21.360]
I went out of time.

[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:21.640]

[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:21.960]
I went out of time.

[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:26.620]
I went out of time because I was in Vegas and he's coming to Vegas.

[01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:28.620]
Like right around New Year's.

[01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:31.200]
So I'm here to January 5th and there's anything free I want.

[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.580]
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.

[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.320]
Mobile and for Lauderdale.

[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.040]
Yeah, I like to speak to Sheriff Goldstein.

[01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:37.520]
Thank you.

[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:39.100]
I love the sound of that.

[01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:39.240]
Sounds good.

[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:40.780]
I'll follow you any place.

[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.760]
Do you need a Jewish sheriff, don't we?

[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:43.360]
Absolutely.

[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:45.280]
I'd like to be a campaign manager.

[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:46.920]
Let's talk about it.

[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:49.220]
I'm Jewish.

[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:51.540]
I've come from the organ really a minute, but 20 years.

[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:53.340]
I think you'd be an elevator sheriff.

[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:54.200]
We'll buy votes.

[01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:55.500]
We'll print more than it.

[01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:57.100]
We'll have Dix paying a buck.

[01:30:57.220 --> 01:30:58.080]
We'll pay a buck ten.

[01:30:58.220 --> 01:30:59.560]
Derek, you got to get rid of that.

[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:01.400]
That's great publicity thinking.

[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:01.880]
Good space.

[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:02.480]
It really is.

[01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:04.060]
I mean, a total moan.

[01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:07.660]
And one of these days when I debate him, I'm going to highlight his failures.

[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:09.260]
I don't think he'll talk to you.

[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:10.000]
He's afraid.

[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:10.800]
He's going to be running.

[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:11.440]
He's running.

[01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:15.000]
Okay, he's Mr. Macho Man's afraid to debate out Goldstein.

[01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:16.820]
Do you think you think they do?

[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:19.580]
You got any connections you could bring John Gotti down here if you got elected?

[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:20.860]
I mean, let's have a good time.

[01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:21.360]
Okay?

[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:22.500]
You must be very good.

[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:23.420]
We know John.

[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:23.700]
Yeah.

[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:26.000]
I like John because he's getting fat too.

[01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:27.080]
He doesn't aim the weight.

[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:28.280]
He's now a 41 inch waist.

[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.700]
First, we got to get about a jail.

[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:31.820]
Yeah, he'll be up at Friday at home.

[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:34.180]
I want to wish you the best.

[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:35.020]
Thank you very much.

[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:37.040]
Have the holidays and feels very happy.

[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.200]
100 girls, everything else.

[01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:38.880]
And the same to you.

[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:39.580]
Thank you.

[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:39.960]
Okay.

[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.200]
Something about that news, if it's someone else.

[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:44.260]
I'm going to be waiting.

[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:45.320]
I want to see the movie Christmas.

[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:46.900]
Kenna Wade, first showing his 12.

[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:48.560]
You know, they're always can't win.

[01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:50.720]
We had the casino gambling things on a ballot here.

[01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:53.680]
Of course, they're so such vision in a state that they vote.

[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:54.540]
They vote it down every time.

[01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:58.940]
And one of the reasons they give is, oh, the mob is going to come in like they're not

[01:31:58.940 --> 01:31:59.460]
here already.

[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:03.200]
But we couldn't have been interesting twist the little irony on the campaign to say,

[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:04.660]
we're going to bring the mob in.

[01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:04.980]
Okay?

[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.260]
And have a great time for everybody.

[01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:08.460]
The mob's, I mean, the mob runs things.

[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:09.460]
So everyone makes money.

[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.040]
They're very efficient, very practical.

[01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:13.080]
Everybody who makes money has a good time.

[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:13.520]
That's right.

[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:16.100]
12.30, let's go to Miami.

[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:16.560]
Hello?

[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:17.840]
Hi, Okonee.

[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:18.460]
Yes, sir.

[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:18.980]
How are you doing?

[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:19.400]
Great.

[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:20.580]
How's Mr. Goldstein?

[01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:21.280]
How are you today?

[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:22.100]
I'm fine.

[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:26.540]
Listen, I was just wondering if you got a chance to see Howard Stern show the other weekend.

[01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:29.140]
I think the show is terrible.

[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:36.000]
I feel bad because I sued Howard because I did his TV show and he edited me out because

[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.080]
I'm an afterman.

[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:39.320]
But he owed me $550 which he wouldn't pay.

[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:42.660]
So I took him to small claims point and we settled him $350.

[01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:46.100]
Did you see that lesbian to mesh to me out on there?

[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:47.540]
Did you see that one, Patty?

[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:48.920]
I heard some people telling that was cute.

[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:50.440]
But he's too ugly to be on television.

[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.500]
His nose is too big.

[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:53.640]
He needs a nose job.

[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:55.940]
His hair is too long to have a hair like that.

[01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.780]
He's degrading, yes, but he is very talented.

[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:00.580]
On radio.

[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:01.280]
On radio.

[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:02.800]
His radio shows great as TV.

[01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:06.820]
You know, this is about his third or fourth attempt on TV and he just doesn't cut it on

[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:07.140]
TV.

[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:08.220]
He's gruesome.

[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:09.400]
No, no, it's true.

[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:13.580]
He's bad and then the horse's teeth, what's an ambulance?

[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:16.900]
Rob and Rob should be shot.

[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:17.880]
But she counts.

[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:19.880]
She should listen to her foot, and tap.

[01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:25.620]
One or two percent of porn is about this.

[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:31.400]
The other 90 percent, 98 percent, is consenting sex men and women who are exhibitionists who

[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:36.740]
have desires of being stars, who enjoy sex, who want to do it.

[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:39.080]
They're no different than people who are athletes.

[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:41.520]
Who are football players, or hockey players.

[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:44.660]
They're proud of their specialties and what's wrong with them.

[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:48.300]
I mean, again, it's easy to distinguish.

[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:54.760]
Do you think that the repression that they put on that is what causes these mass murder

[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:57.900]
types to claim that pornography is what fuels them?

[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:05.120]
Well, the famous one, who is the guy who is the funny, blinded and panicked?

[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:09.240]
I mean, all the studies I've seen was abused as a child.

[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:12.540]
His grandfather threw him against the wall.

[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:13.540]
He was an alcoholic.

[01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:18.520]
Bundy learned to be violent because he didn't learn love.

[01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:21.140]
He was brutalized and sort of won.

[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:22.400]
That's how he learned things.

[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:24.540]
Child abuse has become child abuse.

[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:27.160]
Pneography didn't fit anything into his life.

[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:32.640]
Everyone admits, including Gloria Steinem and Betty Frieden, that rape is not a crime

[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:33.620]
of sex.

[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:36.200]
I mean, this is boring to kneel as to me.

[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:37.720]
We've been through it for so many years.

[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:39.920]
But rape is not a crime of sex.

[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:40.880]
It's a crime of violence.

[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:41.620]
It's power.

[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:46.700]
And so Bundy blamed anybody, blamed society.

[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.440]
He refused to take responsibility.

[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.920]
And of course, the right wing jumped on his blaming a pornography.

[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:58.760]
What pornography does is it results, if it's good pornography, in an activity.

[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:04.840]
The activity is masturbation or sexuality with one's girlfriend, boyfriend or wife.

[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:09.600]
If you think that that's an activity that's a sin, this Catholic's believe that masturbation

[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.440]
is, obviously you're against pornography.

[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.520]
It's that simple.

[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:15.460]
Oh, I always just curious what you felt about it.

[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:17.920]
And I also wanted to thank Neil for what you do with the Camille town.

[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.020]
OK, thanks a lot.

[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:23.760]
And I think Nick should personally hand you some type of citation or award for what

[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.100]
you're doing.

[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:30.220]
And if I've probably a very hairy palm, you're probably waiting in pop-up beach right now.

[01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:33.280]
And if I've been proud of you, get my boat out.

[01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:34.220]
Thank you very much.

[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:36.720]
Have a good day and good luck on the campaign.

[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:37.200]
Thanks.

[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:37.720]
Bye-bye.

[01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:39.860]
1245 at WIWD.

[01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:41.660]
We've got two open lines of both in Dade County.

[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:43.640]
751 repression.

[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:46.480]
7519463 Tamarack.

[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:47.320]
Hi, Neil.

[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:47.740]
Yes.

[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:48.560]
Good day, Neil.

[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:49.300]
Good day, Alan.

[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:49.880]
Hi.

[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:52.340]
First of all, Neil, question how I ask out.

[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.000]
I was watching a show at the Neil.

[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:55.580]
And I'm not much into horse.

[01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:58.300]
I'm just trying to get a bit of a reward for walking in.

[01:35:58.660 --> 01:35:58.840]
Yeah.

[01:35:59.340 --> 01:35:59.880]
Oh, yes.

[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:01.120]
I'm not a veterinarian.

[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:03.640]
But why is my horse break the cycle prism?

[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:05.520]
It breaks down to the house of the destroyer.

[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:05.860]
It's here.

[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:06.880]
Let the animal live.

[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:07.420]
It can't be.

[01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:09.060]
Just walk around on the car.

[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:10.640]
The horses have to stand.

[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:11.400]
I know that.

[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:16.080]
And Ruffian was such a tremendous horse that when she broke down in that mat race with

[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:19.980]
fuller's pleasure, they tried to savor anyway, which a lesser horse they would have just

[01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:21.520]
put to sleep immediately.

[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:24.060]
And they operated and they tried to savor.

[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:25.420]
And the operation was successful.

[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:30.020]
But the problem was that she, even under medication, horses thrash around.

[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:30.920]
It's like a reflex.

[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:32.860]
And so much that she re-broked a leg.

[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:35.100]
And in a very short period of time, they had the destroyer.

[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:38.180]
But horses are just the standup kind of animals.

[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:40.600]
And they have to stand on their legs and the.

[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:41.620]
Is that the clear room?

[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:43.720]
The car abridged.

[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:45.620]
Have very thin legs, great big bodies.

[01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:47.280]
That was a pressure on a leg.

[01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:47.860]
Yeah.

[01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:49.640]
Well, that's one of the reasons it more from breakdown.

[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:53.300]
And for example, standard breads are harness horses because they're running and they're putting

[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:55.000]
more pressure and they're built differently.

[01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:56.160]
I think so.

[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:59.760]
In other words, less the horses like spectacular Seattle's clue.

[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:01.780]
They really don't go out that way to try to save it.

[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:04.980]
And they really didn't think of the horses they could put out of its majorly right.

[01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:05.240]
Yeah.

[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.640]
Because it's just it's virtually impossible.

[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:09.140]
I think that's the most basic.

[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:12.780]
If they had the ability to do it, like go for one, to broke down in the abridged

[01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:14.140]
a couple of few weeks ago.

[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:16.140]
It's just a hopeless situation.

[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:19.720]
Well, I thought the reason they did it was they could try for horses, who wish they

[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:20.840]
thought they could save the horse.

[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:23.560]
But since it couldn't run anymore, they couldn't make any more money out of the killer.

[01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:23.980]
No.

[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:24.800]
That's what I thought.

[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:25.360]
Okay.

[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:26.640]
I mean, it's Gallic question now.

[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:28.120]
But the horse had a very thin waist.

[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:28.860]
Right.

[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:30.160]
Oh, geez.

[01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:32.820]
He said the horse was good looking because it had a thin waist.

[01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:35.060]
Oh, okay.

[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:40.860]
I mean, if you have a little bit of a we had a natural party for much of medical students

[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:44.460]
which I am one and they're pretty preferred to die because we're the most the most.

[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:45.400]
Yeah, we've seen all of those.

[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:46.440]
Looking at bills.

[01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:47.500]
Yeah, we wait.

[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:48.160]
What do I graduate?

[01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:53.760]
My film is talking about a company that makes really good videos.

[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.500]
Not nothing was violence, but for Janus J.

[01:37:57.820 --> 01:37:58.480]
And you were a tip of it?

[01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:04.260]
Well, there was a company, Janus, that actually used to do in legitimate foreign films in the

[01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:04.960]
60s.

[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.340]
Janus, they're locating California somewhere.

[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:07.580]
Okay.

[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:11.860]
It must be a new company because Janus was actually a releasing company of foreign films

[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.820]
that were all rated and were not sexual.

[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:17.540]
So if I get a couple titles, maybe you recognize it.

[01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:17.660]
It's a little bit of a fancy film.

[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:17.940]
Yeah, I'll go ahead and shoot.

[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:19.640]
Mondo fetish.

[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:20.700]
Yeah, okay.

[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:21.980]
If I've heard of those films, right?

[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:22.600]
Yeah, but...

[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:25.180]
And they're the kinky kinds of films and they're available.

[01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:27.320]
Yeah, but not down in Florida, right?

[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:28.720]
Well, Florida, I mean.

[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:30.120]
Or was that Hondo fetish?

[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:32.240]
Is that somebody who's got a pen for John Hadler check?

[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:32.860]
What is that?

[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:35.320]
How it is the Jewish one, Hondo fetish, right?

[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:36.280]
Yeah, it's a lot of them.

[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:38.860]
I would go bargaining with a see them.

[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:40.500]
Yeah, very good.

[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:41.720]
I want them to be the big eaters like Al.

[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:42.760]
Mondo bread fetish.

[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:44.520]
Okay, I'm a question.

[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:45.200]
I want to be a hell.

[01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:47.420]
We can never understand.

[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:48.480]
We never make use of these.

[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:53.400]
What is the attraction for all most old men for women with women?

[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:54.700]
Oh, okay.

[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:56.780]
I think what I believe, it's non-threatening.

[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:01.900]
That most guys, I think, don't know what to look at in a point of film.

[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:03.860]
They don't want to look at another male Chinatail.

[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:04.380]
Yeah, I know.

[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:05.380]
Like I'm hung up with that.

[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:06.000]
I'm a big one.

[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:06.520]
I'm a smaller.

[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:07.920]
He has two.

[01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:08.640]
I only have one.

[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:09.580]
You know, stuff like that.

[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:12.320]
But you look at two women, three women.

[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:15.800]
There's nothing that is frightening to you.

[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:16.340]
What's threatening?

[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:22.900]
Plus the average male ego is such that he figures these women would not be with each other if he was on the set.

[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:27.900]
And the ultimate taboo was in one of our films.

[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.700]
Not sure if it was screw on screen or it happened in Hollywood.

[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.460]
We had a male male scene.

[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:33.840]
And that was a no-no.

[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:38.240]
That's scary because that is very threatening to most men.

[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:43.480]
Because I really think most men do have late homosexuality.

[01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:45.600]
And I'm afraid of that.

[01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:50.340]
And you don't have the problem of Montshow, Masculinity.

[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:52.520]
If you're looking at two and three women, do you have a...

[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:59.120]
I'm sure that four sexualities concerned that each person has a continuum where your line is joined.

[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:03.900]
Those with male have both female and female characters because they're females, right?

[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:05.060]
And to tell you, express it.

[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:06.460]
I know I agree with that.

[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:10.160]
I run a lot of phone lines in New York, sex phone lines.

[01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:14.700]
The most popular one, and I'll clean it up, is chicks with penises.

[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.760]
It's got a different name in the pages.

[01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:19.160]
It's a screw.

[01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:20.300]
It's a...

[01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:24.060]
Yes, pre-ops, transsexuals.

[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:28.760]
This turns on a guy because he seems to be with a woman with breasts.

[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:32.200]
That woman also has male apparatus.

[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:39.620]
So it is the number one grossing, economic grossing sex phone on we have in New York.

[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:42.400]
That seems to sound like a mixed message to a man, right?

[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:46.200]
But I think it's doubly exciting because it's also kinky, he hasn't done it.

[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:51.020]
And I mean, don't get phone sex lines or about fantasy.

[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:57.480]
Phone sex lines are about doing what you're not doing if you're married guys with the same woman all the time.

[01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:59.360]
It's exciting and stimulating.

[01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:01.820]
All I know is the numbers are really very good on that.

[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.500]
It makes the most money for us.

[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:06.340]
Okay, well, because I think they start to worry well.

[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:06.720]
Yeah.

[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:09.040]
You think they look far now?

[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:09.860]
Yeah, she's very pretty.

[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:11.400]
I've seen her in LA.

[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:15.380]
I haven't interviewed her, but she's a very attractive woman.

[01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:17.160]
Are there a lot of Jewish pointers for her?

[01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:19.640]
Yeah, with the interesting thing, we did a story in the screw.

[01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:22.200]
90% of the males are Jewish.

[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:29.280]
The women are all from like trailer cities or 98% of the women are all Christians.

[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:31.400]
Usually raised from very religious families.

[01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:37.420]
The only Jewish ones I know really were Gloria Lennon who's much past her prime family doing it.

[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:46.280]
But the women were all Catholic and the guys were happy to be getting it for free and also getting paid for it.

[01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:47.520]
Harry Reams.

[01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:49.440]
My John Lennon.

[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:50.180]
Jamie Gillis.

[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:51.340]
No, not John Lennon.

[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:52.560]
Jamie Gillis is Jewish.

[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.300]
Yeah, Jamie Gillis.

[01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:56.520]
For John Lennon, he's ugly, but he is ugly.

[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:57.140]
He is ugly.

[01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:58.340]
He is a real man.

[01:41:58.940 --> 01:41:59.220]
He is Jewish.

[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:00.980]
How it's turned nose doesn't he?

[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:02.380]
Jamie Gillis, who's known as his ugly?

[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:04.640]
How it's turned or Jamie Gillis?

[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:05.480]
Have you ever seen the devil?

[01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:06.320]
The devil.

[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:06.380]

[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:07.100]
Yeah.

[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:09.880]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:10.740]
Thanks for calling.

[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:14.640]
1251 at WIOD with Mr. Sheriff Malgoldstein.

[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:19.980]
We have an open line in Broward 524 to end date 751 WIOD.

[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:21.960]
Now, I want you to help me with a spot because you're a match.

[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:22.620]
Hello Steve.

[01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:23.160]
Really?

[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:24.720]
How old were you when you made that movie?

[01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:25.440]
Gloria Lennon.

[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:26.240]
You don't remember?

[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:27.340]
You still don't remember that movie?

[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:28.620]
In passing, I do.

[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:31.980]
Last time you hear you put on an acuportetti, you didn't remember the movie with Gloria Lennon.

[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:32.720]
But I remember that.

[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:35.480]
The only thing that happened in Hollywood where you see me knew doing it.

[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:37.120]
Oh, this is a dream.

[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:37.740]
Oh, true.

[01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:39.840]
Slim and beautiful.

[01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:41.300]
Mobile.

[01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:43.780]
Hello.

[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:44.480]
Yes, sir.

[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:44.880]
Hi.

[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.060]
I'd like to say hello to Al.

[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:49.000]
Hi, how you doing?

[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:49.720]
How you doing, Al?

[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:50.180]
Go see me.

[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:52.160]
I haven't spoken to you in about 13 years.

[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:53.880]
So I'd like to answer if you'd like to.

[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:53.960]
Two.

[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:57.280]
Number one is Joe Stovesooper in 116-14.

[01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:58.920]
Sam thinks he was.

[01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:00.040]
He died of AIDS.

[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:01.100]
Oh, you're kidding.

[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:04.920]
Four years ago, we have a new super named OB-OBI.

[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:09.840]
But we love Joe because he was big, fat, and he made me look thin-faced.

[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:13.080]
I have a picture of you, myself and Joe.

[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:14.040]
And I know you.

[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:15.080]
The toy place.

[01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:18.660]
I'm at the toy place, the kidney place.

[01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:20.340]
You're God, it's bunnies, right?

[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:20.840]
Right.

[01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:21.600]
I got you.

[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:22.420]
Hey, how are you?

[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:23.300]
How are you feeling?

[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:24.360]
I heard you were down here.

[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:26.300]
Oh, you haven't down here for about 13 years.

[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:28.340]
Okay, so are you Broward?

[01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:28.920]
Yes.

[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:29.900]
Are you Broward?

[01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:31.380]
Are you a registered voter?

[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:32.480]
Absolutely.

[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:32.860]
Good.

[01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:33.640]
You're going to be useful.

[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:34.960]
Now we have people.

[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:38.220]
Now I think we should go to dinner because I know some great places to see.

[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:38.980]
Okay, good.

[01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:39.920]
And I'm no lightweight.

[01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:40.820]
Okay.

[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:41.520]
I like that.

[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:42.360]
I don't remember you.

[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:44.040]
You remember me being in front of my Rolls Royce?

[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:44.240]

[01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:46.500]
Yeah, in front of your turquoise Rolls Royce.

[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:46.780]
That's right.

[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:48.820]
I remember the election is in 92.

[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.200]
I got to live long enough for the election.

[01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:53.500]
You know, you got to have to cut some of these meals on.

[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:53.820]
Okay.

[01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:54.720]
Believe me.

[01:43:55.940 --> 01:43:58.940]
Let me ask what you still have that little magazine gadget?

[01:43:59.500 --> 01:43:59.680]
No.

[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.060]
It was a newsletter that tested electronics.

[01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:03.980]
We did it for 12 years.

[01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:08.560]
We gave it up three years ago because newsletters are not successful unless they have stock

[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:11.860]
tips or the dealing with your own particular business.

[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:15.760]
As a discretionary publication, people would rather buy profit in mechanics and popular

[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:16.220]
science.

[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:17.680]
So we let that go.

[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:19.540]
Well, let me ask you a question.

[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:23.640]
Or if you want to give me a number, I'll give you my number.

[01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:24.460]
Absolutely.

[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:25.380]
Absolutely.

[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:26.760]
Okay, hold on a second.

[01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:27.060]
Okay.

[01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:27.640]
Okay.

[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:29.820]
That's on the star line.

[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.420]
Now, why don't you take his number?

[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:32.280]
Good.

[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:32.720]
Thank you.

[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:35.380]
And then I will call him in and you can swap numbers or whatever.

[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:36.300]
Thank you.

[01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:36.820]
Thank you.

[01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:41.280]
By the way, I have to do a little play by play on this to show you what a captivating show

[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:43.680]
we've had here today for these last three hours.

[01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:48.760]
If we only, now is the time, even as ugly as we are in fact, we'll be on television because

[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:52.620]
Patty is sitting here with one elbow on the tail with a dog in her lap.

[01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:54.580]
They are both sound asleep.

[01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:55.900]
Well, she's content.

[01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:56.920]
She had a nice breakfast.

[01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:58.900]
She's tired of hearing your BS.

[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:03.020]
She's turned it all immediately for when the face told me that she's just having a nice

[01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:03.380]
rest.

[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:05.220]
And she is out solid.

[01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:08.320]
I mean, I could see I could scream and it ain't going to bother her.

[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:09.560]
Yeah, Ms. Milwaukee is sleepy.

[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:11.760]
And she's had three years of bliss with me.

[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:12.940]
She's my fourth wife.

[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:15.480]
Well, yeah, you can say all this now because she can't respond.

[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:16.320]
No, no, no.

[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:18.360]
You realize that she has her dreams.

[01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:22.360]
She always wanted the Jewish husband and she has one for a sixer.

[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:23.800]
That is the ultimate objective.

[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:24.360]
Is it?

[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:25.500]
Have a Jew.

[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:26.800]
Her own Jew.

[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:28.340]
I thought it was no big deal.

[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:33.340]
Anyway, we have an open line today at 751 and one on the star line for our great bell

[01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:34.700]
soft mobility folks out there.

[01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:38.780]
Star I OD Elaine Etto is standing by with our exciting one o'clock news.

[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:41.760]
Elaine who is very by the way speaking of fetish, she is in the old man.

[01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:42.660]
She really is.

[01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:43.020]
Yeah.

[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:44.880]
Well, much older than you.

[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:47.060]
You have a happy way to she until.

[01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:50.640]
Well, I don't know, but her way is like Karen Carpenter.

[01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:52.420]
Anyway, she's got the one o'clock news.

[01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:55.140]
We'll come back without volts to one or five Rick and Puts.

[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:56.460]
How are you thinking?

[01:45:56.780 --> 01:45:57.780]
Well, I was playing that.

[01:45:57.980 --> 01:45:58.620]
I got it.

[01:45:58.640 --> 01:45:59.780]
I got it all song for you.

[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:01.560]
You know, you're going to get the living and breathing vote.

[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:01.980]
Right.

[01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:02.720]
That's it.

[01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:07.800]
But the big geriatric vote, you come out and deal with an early bird special.

[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:09.020]
I'm serious.

[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:10.040]
But early bird vote.

[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:12.620]
Early bird everything.

[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:13.180]
You're right.

[01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:13.660]
I give them.

[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:15.900]
Can I give them a good traffic ticket?

[01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:17.220]
Early bird.

[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:18.560]
I'm serious.

[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:19.120]
Oh, you're right.

[01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:20.380]
It's a brilliant win him over.

[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:21.160]
No problem at all.

[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:22.080]
Early bird voting.

[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:24.460]
I'll give him chicken soup before they go into the back.

[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:24.840]

[01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:25.400]
It's brilliant.

[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:30.920]
In fact, when they're standing online, you would put up a big sign, Rascal House North.

[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:33.780]
OK, and we'll pretend that they're standing online down here.

[01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:36.940]
And you'll have a guy working a line with bagels and rolls.

[01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:39.240]
We'll stuff silverware and sweet and low in their pocket.

[01:46:39.380 --> 01:46:39.600]
You're right.

[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:40.240]
You're going to have it made.

[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:41.440]
You'll shuffle in.

[01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:41.840]
No, no, no.

[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:42.740]
Give them what they want.

[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:45.080]
We're going to do it next day's on numbers.

[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:45.740]
OK.

[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:47.120]
Carol City.

[01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:48.620]
Right here.

[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:49.180]
You can hold on.

[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:50.080]
OK.

[01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:50.960]
Yeah, what's up, man?

[01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:52.000]
Was that a speaker phone on?

[01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:53.300]
Yeah, a speaker phone.

[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:54.860]
You can hold it up.

[01:46:54.940 --> 01:46:55.100]
You can always tell.

[01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:56.280]
All these hot shots as you can.

[01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:57.400]
You can always tell the right.

[01:46:57.740 --> 01:46:58.000]
No, no, no, no.

[01:46:58.060 --> 01:46:59.300]
How good they say it is.

[01:46:59.420 --> 01:46:59.720]
Terrible.

[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:02.640]
You can always tell it's it's you only in the canyon.

[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:04.100]
This is a brand new one, dude.

[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:08.140]
Yeah, but we could tell how the way you tell when I'm going to clear

[01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:10.480]
a voice and it means it's something about it.

[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:10.980]
It's not good.

[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:14.980]
You probably bought the $39 model from Home Shopping Center or something.

[01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:16.380]
No, this one was $161.

[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:18.700]
But you got peanut babe because I paid $19.95.

[01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:21.340]
But it's great because you can keep one hand on the phone and the other hand

[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:21.980]
somewhere else.

[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:24.320]
Yeah, well, it's for you scratch your forehead.

[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:24.780]
I know.

[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:26.360]
Right.

[01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:27.000]
Scratch something.

[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:27.980]
So anyway.

[01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:29.580]
That was a new.

[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:32.580]
This is a new, but yeah, do from a fire you.

[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:34.140]
How are you doing, Lou?

[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:35.120]
All right, man.

[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:35.840]
I'm all about birth.

[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:36.420]
I'll be there.

[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:37.300]
Happy birthday.

[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:38.380]
I'll be looking for you.

[01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:39.140]
I'll have bells on.

[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:39.960]
Exactly.

[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:41.800]
Somewhere where they can.

[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:42.240]
Okay.

[01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:42.840]
See you tomorrow.

[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:43.500]
No, certainly.

[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:44.820]
Yeah, I have a question for Al.

[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:45.500]
Thank God.

[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:45.920]
Okay.

[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:48.080]
Al, you're definitely wrong.

[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:49.900]
How could you say John Holmes is good looking?

[01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:51.340]
I think he is.

[01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:53.460]
But I like skin.

[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:55.540]
Al is an old man with very weak eyes.

[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:56.020]
Okay.

[01:47:56.280 --> 01:47:57.140]
And I like skinny guys.

[01:47:57.140 --> 01:47:57.740]
I really do.

[01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:59.080]
I mean, I'm a bad as bad.

[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:01.380]
I'm going to be interviewing Dom Deloise in two weeks.

[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:03.420]
And he'll, then you're going to tell me he's handsome.

[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:04.920]
No, I like his funny.

[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:05.700]
He's great.

[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:06.620]
I'm funny.

[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:08.860]
Did you put him in a glad bag and lock him up?

[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:12.040]
Well, we're going to talk about diets because he's very, he's really self-destructive

[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:13.260]
with his food as I am.

[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:15.320]
He's a man of hip, normal surgery.

[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:17.800]
A brilliant guy.

[01:48:17.980 --> 01:48:18.720]
I think he's so funny.

[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:22.080]
Al, whatever happened to Tony the hook, Chris, still around?

[01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:24.500]
No, no, no.

[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:27.120]
Years ago, years ago, you're talking about me.

[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:28.220]
And the stals are films, then.

[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:30.520]
Right.

[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:31.260]
Okay, Lou.

[01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:32.240]
Thanks, Lou.

[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:32.860]
Have a great time.

[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:34.520]
Well, Lou is just an a coma.

[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:36.820]
We have an open line today at 751.

[01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:37.460]
Oh, he's okay.

[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:38.520]
He's just a speechless.

[01:48:38.860 --> 01:48:40.100]
That one hand is too busy.

[01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:40.700]

[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:42.600]
I think we just came to a conclusion.

[01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:46.180]
751, WIOD with Al Goldstein, Sheriff Al.

[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:48.460]
For your holidays, here's a great place.

[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:49.980]
Here's another restaurant you should try.

[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:51.600]
You ever try to find do or you'd realize.

[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:53.620]
O.D. with Sheriff Al.

[01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:55.260]
We have an open line today at 751.

[01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:56.920]
Here's a mobile and port Lauderdale.

[01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:57.480]
Hello.

[01:48:57.760 --> 01:48:58.140]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:58.320 --> 01:48:59.180]
I just went to the tunnel.

[01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:00.520]
I was breaking up.

[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:03.140]
It's a real pleasure to hear you and speak to you, Al Goldstein.

[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:05.660]
I think you're doing fantastic things for people.

[01:49:05.860 --> 01:49:06.480]
Thank you very much.

[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:09.120]
You really want to be a Kenny Tunnel?

[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:10.020]
Yeah.

[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:11.280]
Who is Kenny?

[01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:13.220]
Are you going to change the name to a Kenzie Tunnel?

[01:49:14.140 --> 01:49:15.480]
But who is this guy Kenny?

[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:17.500]
He must have been some county person.

[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:17.900]
Who knows?

[01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:19.200]
Henry Kenny.

[01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:19.880]
I have no idea.

[01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:21.420]
Probably a friend of Sheriff Nick.

[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:24.120]
Well, he did poinfoam.

[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:26.540]
It's something about Sheriff Nick.

[01:49:27.420 --> 01:49:31.160]
But watch after the holidays and after the inauguration.

[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:33.940]
I think you're going to see some involve Sheriff Nick.

[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:34.740]
Good.

[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:36.920]
I really do think his day is a numbed.

[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:39.740]
I think the old ad is enough rope and no hang themself.

[01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:42.140]
It's culminating into so much stuff.

[01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:43.180]
It's perfectly true with him.

[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:47.420]
Could you tell me I said you covered the murder trial of John Holmes.

[01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:47.760]
Yes.

[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:48.860]
Could you refresh my memory?

[01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:52.160]
It was the Laurel Canyon murders.

[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:56.960]
In LA there's a guy Eddie Nash who was a drug dealer.

[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.280]
He's still in prison.

[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:03.820]
And John Holmes was a cocaine user, heroin user, really heavy drugs.

[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:08.740]
And there were four people murdered in Laurel Canyon.

[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:09.780]
Holmes was there.

[01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:11.580]
Holmes went on trial.

[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:15.080]
And any other jurisdiction but LA he would have been convicted.

[01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:18.960]
But the jury and I was there covering the trial for playboy.

[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:20.660]
That's very funny.

[01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:26.680]
So what happened was according to the defense John was forced to be there.

[01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:30.980]
Eddie Nash had been ripped off in some drug purchase and wanted revenge.

[01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:37.200]
And so Holmes and I were the saviour and led everybody to this other group of people

[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:39.160]
and all four were massacred.

[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:41.160]
And Holmes was acquitted.

[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:42.720]
But I spent time with him.

[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:43.520]
I interviewed him.

[01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:47.420]
And I mean he was a psychopath but he was a very interesting one.

[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:51.180]
And he stopped talking to me because I found that the real story by this life.

[01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:52.080]
He's born in Pennsylvania.

[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:53.600]
His father was a real road man.

[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:56.900]
He had made it a story that his mother was very wealthy.

[01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:58.340]
He grew up in upstate New York.

[01:50:58.740 --> 01:51:01.000]
And he was angry that I ran the real story.

[01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:02.560]
And he ever tracked playboy.

[01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:04.780]
It was probably one of the best articles I've ever written.

[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:08.280]
Last month's playboy had an article about me about fishing in Bangkok.

[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:10.400]
And Neil and I were talking about the truth.

[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:13.280]
Bangkok is the place to go before you die.

[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:14.120]
That's what I understand.

[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:15.280]
Bangkok you will love.

[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:16.600]
We are more friends who love it.

[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:19.600]
I'm serious about Bangkok is where you must go.

[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:24.340]
But I'm also told there's a place called something like Boyz Town where we can find lots of young men.

[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:26.560]
We're in Bangkok.

[01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:27.260]
Nearby.

[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:28.860]
Well, we've been possibly.

[01:51:29.180 --> 01:51:31.300]
Anything you can buy anything in Bangkok.

[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:34.760]
The main area is Pat Pong, which is where the sex is.

[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:40.840]
But I've been patty to a show a year and a half ago and what women do with chopsticks are amazing.

[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:43.800]
It's great though.

[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:44.820]
Everything is for sale.

[01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:46.300]
There is no sin.

[01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:47.200]
It's not dirty.

[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:48.400]
It's just a job.

[01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:50.300]
And it is essential.

[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.880]
Plus I love Thai food.

[01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:54.020]
It's wonderful.

[01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:55.400]
I think Bangkok is a great food.

[01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:58.660]
I met a guy from Thailand and we spent some time together.

[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:03.020]
And afterward I said something about being well equipped.

[01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:05.020]
And he said we're not Chinese.

[01:52:06.180 --> 01:52:07.680]
Which I thought was rather cute.

[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:10.300]
Well, Patty will tell you a story.

[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:14.080]
We were with a friend of ours from LA who's gay.

[01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:18.700]
And so he took me to a gay club he'd been to.

[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:23.320]
And Patty was with me and 50 guys were on stage doing it.

[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:27.020]
And I remember telling Patty, look at all these guys looking at me.

[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:27.760]
They want to look at me.

[01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:29.680]
They were looking at Patty because they're mostly bisexual.

[01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:33.380]
But anything goes there.

[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:34.520]
And I think it's great.

[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:35.840]
I think Bangkok is the place.

[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:40.180]
If I went on married, it's where I'd want to retire too.

[01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:40.900]
The hell would Switzerland.

[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:43.540]
Who would love to?

[01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:44.460]
We're talking about Switzerland.

[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:45.500]
I just thought that's for everything.

[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:45.940]
Okay.

[01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:48.100]
Okay, have a good one.

[01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:48.820]
Thanks a lot.

[01:52:49.260 --> 01:52:50.380]
118 in WIO.

[01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:51.620]
Do we have an open line on the star?

[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:53.480]
Where did Switzerland come from all of a sudden?

[01:52:53.580 --> 01:52:54.160]
Are you talking about Angela?

[01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:56.920]
People always say retire in Switzerland.

[01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:57.660]
For what?

[01:52:58.120 --> 01:52:59.800]
It's so beautiful and you see the mountains.

[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:01.540]
You want to see mountains.

[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:02.600]
You don't have to go to Switzerland.

[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:03.880]
The Amsterdam is great.

[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:05.500]
No, but it's too cold.

[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:06.860]
Bangkok's always warm.

[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:07.780]
It's 80 and 90 degrees.

[01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:10.580]
Listen, I don't want to sound like a world traveler because I've been to Europe two years

[01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:12.300]
in a row, which hardly qualifies me.

[01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:13.760]
I mean, been to Hawaii six times.

[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:16.840]
But as far as out of this country, I've been to Europe twice.

[01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:18.560]
And I was in Rome.

[01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:20.160]
I was in Amsterdam.

[01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:22.720]
I was in Copenhagen, which I thought was very boring.

[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:24.700]
By the way, they totally sanitize Copenhagen.

[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:26.320]
It's like a pepper pine.

[01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:26.800]
It's boring.

[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.040]
Tivoli gardens went to?

[01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:28.660]
Boring.

[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:31.100]
It's like the size of this room, Tivoli gardens.

[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:33.160]
But Rome was outstanding.

[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:33.840]
Exciting.

[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:37.060]
I think that all of Europe, I mean, you know, and years go on.

[01:53:37.060 --> 01:53:39.180]
Hopefully if I'm still around, I'm going to check it all out.

[01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:40.660]
But I think Europe is fascinating.

[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:41.720]
The dollar is weak.

[01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:42.660]
Did you find that?

[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:44.060]
I felt porn Europe.

[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:50.440]
I'm going to be going in June on a cruise with Patti, which I've never done cruise before.

[01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:52.740]
But I'm told it's 13 days of eating.

[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:53.960]
And that's really exciting.

[01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:56.060]
I'm cruising.

[01:53:56.620 --> 01:53:57.740]
Oh, it's incredible.

[01:53:58.760 --> 01:53:58.760]

[01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:00.160]
Amazing.

[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:00.900]
Wait, wait, wait.

[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.380]
By the way, you know, maybe we can have the sheriff in the box.

[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:05.440]
Okay, because that's what that thing's going to happen by 90.

[01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:06.200]
You got to stop.

[01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:08.180]
You got to stop.

[01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:09.480]
I'm going to watch my food.

[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:13.500]
But we would like to have your own Max card, because you want to eat at some of the best restaurants in town.

[01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:15.380]
That's all we talk about on this show is food.

[01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:17.420]
And I'm telling him to stop.

[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:19.320]
But you might as well save some money.

[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:20.580]
Okay, spread it around a little bit.

[01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:24.360]
If you like Chinese food, Japanese, German, Mexican, deli, whatever it is.

[01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:28.360]
Max card is honored at some of the very finest restaurants all over South Florida.

[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:29.860]
In fact, in the...

[01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:30.900]
Yeah, an eating cruise.

[01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:32.820]
123 with Mr. Food.

[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:37.020]
Why don't you just forget about your sheriff, the guy in Channel 10 looks a little long in the two-foot.

[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:38.400]
I love Mr. Food.

[01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:43.160]
You know you had problems with the station saying that I'm afraid I'm going to be on and you know I'm clean.

[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:44.560]
I didn't understand.

[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:46.440]
I'm not sure if they were growing that.

[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:48.020]
Yeah, I'm much better to talk about food.

[01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:49.360]
How's Alex Bennett doing by the way?

[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:50.620]
We did the show in San Francisco.

[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:52.800]
And Alex is good ratings there.

[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:53.360]
And he's happy.

[01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:54.120]
He hated Florida.

[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:55.380]
Florida hated him.

[01:54:55.780 --> 01:54:57.020]
And he's happy in San Francisco.

[01:54:57.720 --> 01:54:58.620]
And he's funny.

[01:54:58.820 --> 01:54:59.840]
He said that he's now 29.

[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:01.220]
I should tell you.

[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:02.900]
You remember him?

[01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:03.820]
You nailed it.

[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:06.400]
By the end of next year, this guy should be like a teenager.

[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:08.500]
In fact, by the end of the year, you'll fly him to Bangkok.

[01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:10.580]
Okay, I'll be like a unmo, lay there.

[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:13.780]
Well, I loved it because Alex is a friend and then he got caught in this lie.

[01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:16.800]
And you remember his age from his previous time.

[01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:17.840]
And he's nailed.

[01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:19.700]
And he didn't know what to do with it.

[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:23.160]
Because we lay up patty with lay up as he would have.

[01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:24.400]
Well, first of all, the guy looks...

[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:26.640]
If I looked at him, I'd say his guy is really 50s.

[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:27.560]
Which is about what he is.

[01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:27.740]

[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:30.460]
And he started out when he filled in for me.

[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:31.200]
He was 49.

[01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:32.060]
According to him.

[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:34.300]
Then he'd come back here to work a full-time gig.

[01:55:34.420 --> 01:55:35.240]
Now he's 44.

[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:36.500]
Well, it's just a few months.

[01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:38.140]
He just dropped five years.

[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:39.620]
And you pointed at that.

[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:41.220]
I don't know how much he had to understand that.

[01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:46.020]
When you're bald and aging and wrinkly, I mean, he's not a hideous guy.

[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:46.700]
But he's old.

[01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:47.300]
Like, we are.

[01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:47.940]
He's getting up there.

[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:49.600]
Why lie about your age?

[01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:50.520]
How can he be so famous?

[01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:51.460]
I thought him so, Larry.

[01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:52.320]
I loved it.

[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:52.980]
I...

[01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:53.980]
And let's see.

[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:56.360]
I mean, I didn't dig his act.

[01:55:56.460 --> 01:55:59.560]
I'm sure out there he's got the big names, Robin Williams and all those people.

[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:01.240]
And you know, they're into his thing.

[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:02.560]
I couldn't get into his thing at all.

[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:03.860]
It didn't fit this market.

[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.040]
The audience didn't take to him.

[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:08.120]
But the thing that bothered me about Alex, and of course,

[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:09.460]
as I look back to being...

[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:10.100]
Try to be fair.

[01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:11.940]
I can understand he was very uncomfortable.

[01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:15.840]
Because he came into a situation that's totally unlike what he's ever been in before.

[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:18.360]
I mean, this is not LA and it's not Frisco and Simon New York.

[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:19.980]
This is a tough place.

[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:21.680]
And...

[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:22.940]
But he was uptight about it.

[01:56:22.940 --> 01:56:25.200]
And just like the thing about his age, if he would it...

[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:27.800]
Because his whole stick was the comedy and the stand-up comics.

[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:30.520]
If he himself would have had a better sense of humor about things,

[01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:33.420]
and not been so uptight, I think he'd have had a better chance.

[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:36.380]
And I think bringing Penn down the first week was a kiss of death.

[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:37.680]
Because he always went to antagonist.

[01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:39.520]
It really endeared him to me.

[01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:42.040]
126 at WIOD.

[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:42.700]
Hi, Alia.

[01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:44.520]
Hi, Neil.

[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:46.660]
I'm a really enjoying your show today.

[01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:47.220]
Thank you.

[01:56:48.140 --> 01:56:49.780]
I certainly hope that...

[01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:52.720]
That Al does get elected up there in Broward County.

[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:53.340]
Thank you very much.

[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:54.280]
Just crown out of there.

[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:56.840]
He's got my ten votes.

[01:56:57.320 --> 01:56:57.540]
Yeah.

[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:01.000]
I think I've moved to Broward County just to vote before.

[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:01.400]
Thank you.

[01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:01.840]
Thanks, love.

[01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:08.640]
If you got in, is Sheriff up there with your app...

[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:11.100]
But you have a liberal app, too, towards massage partners?

[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:11.760]
Absolutely.

[01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:12.860]
Of course.

[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:14.100]
What do you mean liberal app?

[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:15.080]
Probably open a business.

[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:15.740]
Yeah.

[01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:19.760]
Listen, anything involved in consensual sex, I'm in favor.

[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:20.120]

[01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:20.680]
I agree with you.

[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:22.000]
You know, gay, spree.

[01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:24.360]
You know, let's leave people alone.

[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:26.900]
I don't want to check your positions out.

[01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:27.880]
I don't want to...

[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:30.060]
Anything goes as long as it's consensual.

[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:33.240]
I would love to see some way of taxing some of those activity

[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:35.040]
to balance some of the money back.

[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:39.680]
But definitely, I would not mind other people's morals.

[01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:43.620]
The safest place to be in Broward County is at a topless club.

[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:46.740]
So I think we need more topless clubs unless they know.

[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.680]
I think, you know, when you come down...

[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:51.380]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:52.340]
You do say less bingo?

[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:52.940]
You're actually...

[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:55.900]
Okay, as your campaign advisor, let me see if there was a bad...

[01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:56.820]
It was a slip of the tongue.

[01:57:57.220 --> 01:57:57.220]

[01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:58.080]
More bingo.

[01:57:58.260 --> 01:57:58.820]
That was what you said.

[01:57:59.180 --> 01:58:00.140]
Lots more bingo.

[01:58:00.380 --> 01:58:01.720]
You got to keep combining it.

[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:02.460]
My strong term.

[01:58:02.620 --> 01:58:03.600]
Can we combine it?

[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:05.180]
Can we do the My Strong and Shuffleboard?

[01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:07.020]
My Strong at the topless clubs.

[01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:07.520]
Excellent.

[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:09.700]
So you bring the Althacaka with you, right?

[01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:12.000]
And he looks at the girls with patty speech.

[01:58:12.540 --> 01:58:13.100]
Topless bingo.

[01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:14.280]
Topless bingo.

[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:15.100]
How did they...

[01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:15.660]
They're shifxing both.

[01:58:15.820 --> 01:58:17.140]
We got topless donut shops.

[01:58:17.380 --> 01:58:18.540]
What's wrong with topless bingo?

[01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:19.280]
Brilliant.

[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:20.180]
I loved it.

[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:20.840]
Okay, we're set.

[01:58:21.020 --> 01:58:21.400]
Thank you.

[01:58:21.580 --> 01:58:22.480]
16 out of the B.

[01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:26.060]
You know, Orlando, they've got Disney World.

[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:31.160]
I think we ought to have some adult programs down here to attract some of the people from...

[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:31.840]
Slash World.

[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:33.000]
There you go.

[01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:33.840]
Thank you.

[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:36.200]
But if we do everything I can to get your life...

[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:36.600]
Thanks a lot.

[01:58:36.740 --> 01:58:37.400]
I appreciate it.

[01:58:37.700 --> 01:58:41.120]
And I love your idea about early bird voting.

[01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:43.920]
And you know, the top of the...

[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:44.380]
Top of the...

[01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:44.820]
Top of the...

[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:45.640]
Patting was right on the front.

[01:58:46.060 --> 01:58:47.620]
That's actually a question, though.

[01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:50.700]
You know, the interesting thing, though, seriously, in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:58:50.900 --> 01:58:52.720]
I mean, talk about pathetic.

[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:56.420]
And again, because you got these apathetic people, nobody says too much they grumble a little.

[01:58:56.460 --> 01:58:58.240]
But unless they're in business and they're all going bankrupt.

[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:01.560]
But here we had Mayor Cox, if we could say that.

[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:03.160]
And...

[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:03.880]
Oh, we don't want all of you.

[01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:04.700]
We don't want spring break.

[01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:08.160]
We don't want all those kids in their rowdy and they're doing this and they're drinking beer.

[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:10.020]
So we had all these repressive laws.

[01:59:10.020 --> 01:59:11.640]
We started busting kids on the beach.

[01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:14.580]
And then we made an overt camp and we said, we don't want you here.

[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:15.960]
Go to Daytona, go to Texas.

[01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:17.960]
We don't want spring break.

[01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:20.960]
So we've had two years ago was bad.

[01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:22.900]
Last year an unmitigated disaster.

[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:27.100]
They tried the senior citizen break, which was a disaster,

[01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:30.360]
because they were spilling prune juice all over their bags as they were crossing the street

[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:31.440]
over their colostomy bags.

[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:32.840]
And he didn't like that.

[01:59:33.140 --> 01:59:38.540]
So now he's got the goal to say, oh, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea.

[01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:40.420]
Let's have spring break back.

[01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:41.580]
Let's invite the kids back.

[01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:41.980]
What do you know?

[01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:46.560]
It's like, if I come to your house and you say to me, you're a jackass.

[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:47.420]
I don't like you.

[01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:48.420]
I hate you like poison.

[01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:49.860]
Don't ever come back to my house again.

[01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:53.600]
And then like six weeks later you say, hey, why don't you come over for a cup of coffee?

[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:55.120]
I don't think I'm coming back.

[01:59:56.020 --> 01:59:57.340]
And that's what he's trying to do.

[01:59:57.420 --> 01:59:58.440]
I mean, these people are nuts.

[01:59:58.700 --> 02:00:00.980]
They were always saying, okay, let's throw this out.

[02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:03.620]
But they never have an idea what they're going to replace it with.

[02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:07.600]
We're never going to have this new world here because we already blew that 30 years ago.

[02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:08.900]
We already blew that down the toilet.

[02:00:08.900 --> 02:00:09.900]
We could have had it.

[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:11.500]
Orlando has got a foothold.

[02:00:11.700 --> 02:00:13.580]
I mean, they're just killing us with that kind of tourism.

[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:16.360]
So the only way this town is really going to make it.

[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:19.440]
And this is after having been in Hawaii all of the weather was terrible.

[02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:24.000]
And in Vegas where the places are jam-packed with tourists and spending millions of dollars.

[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:26.400]
Is this for me the real sun and fun?

[02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:28.820]
Not just talk about it, but let it happen and do it.

[02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:32.420]
It's so true because I was in Atlantic City a couple of weeks ago.

[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:34.480]
And it can never compete with Las Vegas.

[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:35.100]
This is the weather.

[02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:36.360]
What a smutty place.

[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:38.340]
And it's doing things half-ass.

[02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:40.220]
They closed for a clock.

[02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:43.040]
You could go with it or better out.

[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:44.200]
But in spite of that, they're still packing.

[02:00:44.340 --> 02:00:45.660]
And they're still making money.

[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:47.340]
Because they're offering people something they want.

[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:48.600]
You've got the weather here.

[02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:52.920]
This can be such an economic bonanza to everybody.

[02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:59.340]
And I mean, it's amazing to me that the political morons who we vote in.

[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:04.260]
And that's why I think your cynicism is justified because the political system always,

[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:07.020]
always spews forth the worst candidates.

[02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:08.140]
Always.

[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:09.180]
I mean, it's terrible.

[02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:11.380]
Did you vote to caucus against Bush?

[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:11.960]
I couldn't.

[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:13.420]
I hated both of them.

[02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:16.600]
Do caucus denying his membership at the American Civilist?

[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:21.280]
Yeah, but his wife is a lot better at the party than Martha Washington.

[02:01:22.140 --> 02:01:23.540]
That is the first president we ever had.

[02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:25.500]
His grandmother was in the White House with him.

[02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:26.740]
It's sad, isn't it?

[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:26.980]
Yeah.

[02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:29.360]
She's like a sweet lady, but she looks so old.

[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.440]
I hope he has a young mistress.

[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:32.960]
It's a one.

[02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:38.940]
Maybe with a one president's got a small waves, though.

[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:40.000]
He says slowly.

[02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:41.540]
He has a small brain to go with it.

[02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:43.400]
131 at W.Y.O.

[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:44.060]
Do we have an open line?

[02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:46.200]
And before we go on, they more calls.

[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:47.360]
You know, the interesting thing.

[02:01:47.460 --> 02:01:51.020]
I'm sure I said this when you were here last time, but now it's flowered more so.

[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:53.940]
Reagan, who was just a mindless puppet.

[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.080]
You know, firstly, it was a mindless puppet, a GE.

[02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:58.480]
And now he's a mindless puppet for the right-wing extremist.

[02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:01.280]
During his years, we all feared the worst.

[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:03.680]
What will happen, though, is he planted all the seeds.

[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:07.060]
And now, Mr. Kinder, Jettler, fascism has come along.

[02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:12.260]
Under the guise of wanting less government and less repression of being kind and decent everybody.

[02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:14.200]
And now, the seeds have all germinated.

[02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:17.060]
Man, we've got like a fascist state that we're living in.

[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:18.100]
It's getting worse every day.

[02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:21.740]
And the fruits of, you know, the use of a pen of Ronald Reagan.

[02:02:22.900 --> 02:02:25.640]
What's come to fruit from now on, from the time of our Ron Jr. now?

[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:28.060]
No, it's the lack of regulation.

[02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:32.400]
He said less government, so we had more corruption than the savings and loan association.

[02:02:33.100 --> 02:02:34.740]
I mean, this is a country that's run amok.

[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:37.860]
In Reagan's new book, which I looked at parts of it,

[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:40.640]
the book is almost as blank pages.

[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:42.540]
Like he is a blank mind.

[02:02:43.180 --> 02:02:46.280]
And sadly, the American public would probably vote for him again as president.

[02:02:46.660 --> 02:02:48.880]
And, you know, the first one that we had, at least in my lifetime,

[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:51.560]
I remember this whole anti-point thing, was Nixon.

[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:52.360]
Nixon went.

[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:54.280]
And Nixon appointed a one commission.

[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:55.960]
They did a long exhaustive study.

[02:02:55.960 --> 02:02:57.780]
They came up with a conclusion he didn't like.

[02:02:58.020 --> 02:02:59.800]
So then he pointed another group start all over again.

[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:01.960]
And here's a man, talk about morality.

[02:03:02.260 --> 02:03:04.160]
And I want to recommend again, if you weren't listening earlier,

[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:07.520]
the book, High Treason, which is the new book about the Kennedy Assessing Agent.

[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:10.420]
And even if you've read every book that's out, if you read this one,

[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.320]
and I'm almost finished with it, it's incredible.

[02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:14.280]
It's in paperback, you should get it.

[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:20.100]
And you cannot come away reading this book without being convinced that Richard Nixon

[02:03:20.100 --> 02:03:24.160]
and Richard Helms, who was his director of the CIA and Howard Hunt

[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:28.160]
and some of his other water-grade cronies, were also involved in the planning

[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:30.300]
and carrying out of the assassination of John Kennedy.

[02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:33.860]
So here's a man who's appointing all these commissions to study pornography

[02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:39.820]
and immorality, who turns out one of the most immoral politicians in the history of the country.

[02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:40.780]
Happens all the time.

[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:46.400]
And on that first, on Nixon's list of appointed people to the president's commission

[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:48.660]
on obscenity was the name Charles Keening.

[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:50.080]
He was on the committee.

[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:53.520]
It's a fright Mr. Morality, who's since we're paying for through the nose.

[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:55.020]
We've got to pay for four years to come.

[02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:58.660]
133 without Goldstein, we have an open line at day 7519463

[02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:02.040]
and we want to tell you again about our big giveaway,

[02:04:02.180 --> 02:04:03.140]
you're a chance away with words.

[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:06.520]
He said, the Hawaiian traffic guy is bringing in a bunch of stuff to give away

[02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:07.080]
at the remote tomorrow.

[02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:10.500]
He said, you want me to bring him in or just take his crap and, you know,

[02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:12.920]
just take his crap and get him out of here and tell him,

[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.760]
thank you very much and we appreciate it.

[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:16.240]
No, I was in Hawaii.

[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:20.860]
You know, this last vacation of mine, I went to Vegas for what was going to be a day and a half

[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:23.820]
and then I was going to spend a week basking on the beaches of Hawaii.

[02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:25.300]
Checking out all of it.

[02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:26.800]
This is my sixth time there.

[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:27.500]
Love it.

[02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:28.220]
Which island is good.

[02:04:28.620 --> 02:04:29.480]
Always like a key.

[02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:30.280]
I always go to Hawaii.

[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:31.580]
I know this great scenery.

[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:33.300]
I don't want to see scenery, okay.

[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:34.400]
I go away.

[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:35.740]
I want to have a great time.

[02:04:36.460 --> 02:04:41.200]
I get to Hawaii and it is pouring down rain, okay.

[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:47.300]
I left Vegas at 2 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon or 9 o'clock at the morning,

[02:04:47.300 --> 02:04:48.120]
I guess, in Vegas.

[02:04:48.620 --> 02:04:49.540]
I get into Hawaii.

[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:51.400]
It's like 5, 20 in the afternoon.

[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:52.620]
Pouring down rain.

[02:04:53.180 --> 02:04:54.200]
I get in my red car.

[02:04:54.460 --> 02:04:57.960]
I go to the hotel, a high at Regency Red on the Waikiki Beach.

[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:02.100]
It takes me two hours to go out as a 20-minute drive because I've been there a million times.

[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:03.820]
The traffic is unbearable.

[02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:05.580]
I get up the next morning.

[02:05:05.580 --> 02:05:06.980]
The wind is blowing.

[02:05:07.300 --> 02:05:08.100]
It's freezing.

[02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:08.820]
It's nasty.

[02:05:08.820 --> 02:05:10.400]
Of course, I've never been lucky.

[02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:12.460]
All my other times have been there.

[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:13.760]
It's always been paradise.

[02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:14.260]
Perfect.

[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:14.920]
Blue sky.

[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:15.640]
Never rains.

[02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:19.500]
I got on a plane at 120 that afternoon and back to Vegas.

[02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:22.900]
Hawaii is just packed.

[02:05:23.420 --> 02:05:24.340]
Jam packed.

[02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:25.740]
Every hotel is packed.

[02:05:26.380 --> 02:05:28.340]
Every kind of, you talk about beautiful people.

[02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:31.020]
The greatest looking people in the world are in Hawaii.

[02:05:31.140 --> 02:05:31.800]
It's Japanese.

[02:05:32.220 --> 02:05:32.580]
It's the Japanese.

[02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:33.700]
It's 80% Japanese.

[02:05:33.740 --> 02:05:35.060]
The Japanese have taken it over.

[02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:35.940]
It's on the white.

[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:37.180]
Short squads.

[02:05:37.180 --> 02:05:37.720]
No, they're not.

[02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:38.780]
How can you say that?

[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:40.160]
They are a little bold-headed women.

[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:41.500]
If you know this woman, I'm telling you.

[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:43.200]
I said, if I'm bold-

[02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:43.720]
Jesus!

[02:05:44.140 --> 02:05:45.440]
Pat the most panasonic sin.

[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:47.140]
You're all of your bruh.

[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:48.780]
All Japanese are ugly.

[02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:50.740]
I've seen some incredible looking Japanese.

[02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:52.940]
The woman I was turning on, lying in the Japanese.

[02:05:53.060 --> 02:05:53.680]
You're as crazy.

[02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:55.560]
But they're all skinnyed out.

[02:05:55.720 --> 02:05:58.320]
No Japanese guys have over 32-inch weight.

[02:05:58.420 --> 02:05:59.800]
Yeah, but that's just a hip people.

[02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:00.740]
They're not real people.

[02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:01.420]
Oh.

[02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:03.420]
Are you still fighting the warning?

[02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:04.020]
No, it's actually.

[02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:06.380]
You'd better get with it if you're going to be sure if they've taken over.

[02:06:06.380 --> 02:06:08.100]
They're buying up the whole conceptually there.

[02:06:08.180 --> 02:06:09.620]
But either they're not registered voters.

[02:06:09.620 --> 02:06:11.220]
I can still talk to the truth.

[02:06:11.480 --> 02:06:12.140]
They'll lose us.

[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:12.720]
Let me tell you what.

[02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:17.860]
When I was in Japan, when I would go to a boarddello, they would charge Americans more because

[02:06:17.860 --> 02:06:21.700]
we inserted more wear and tear into sexual parts.

[02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:23.080]
They're that small.

[02:06:23.700 --> 02:06:25.220]
They're known for being meniscule.

[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:26.040]
It's no accident.

[02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:28.740]
They created small, trained as deradiers.

[02:06:28.900 --> 02:06:30.460]
They think small is best.

[02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:31.500]
And how about Chinese?

[02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:32.780]
It's not their miniature too.

[02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:33.300]
Minotitude.

[02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:34.100]
Minotitude.

[02:06:34.100 --> 02:06:36.520]
But show me a manly Jewish life.

[02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:38.100]
Let me just say this to you.

[02:06:38.240 --> 02:06:44.480]
In spite of all of those physical problems, handicapped, they still made a billion Chinese.

[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:48.300]
So it goes to show you that it's the motion.

[02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:49.700]
That's right.

[02:06:50.020 --> 02:06:51.140]
Like Howard would say.

[02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:52.740]
I wouldn't say what Howard would say.

[02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:54.540]
I would, but I can't.

[02:06:54.780 --> 02:06:55.240]
140.

[02:06:55.500 --> 02:06:56.620]
Let's take a call from Boka.

[02:06:56.760 --> 02:06:56.960]
Hello.

[02:06:57.260 --> 02:06:57.580]
Neil.

[02:06:57.900 --> 02:06:58.240]
Yes sir.

[02:06:58.560 --> 02:06:59.600]
I ask you all a question.

[02:06:59.760 --> 02:06:59.980]
Sure.

[02:06:59.980 --> 02:07:00.140]
I'll go ahead.

[02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:03.320]
Since Mr. G is an expert on state.

[02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:04.200]
OK.

[02:07:04.460 --> 02:07:05.220]
Chronic sick.

[02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:06.480]
Fort Lauderdale.

[02:07:07.060 --> 02:07:07.380]
Hello.

[02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:08.040]
Yes sir.

[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:08.620]
Yeah.

[02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:09.060]
Hi Neil.

[02:07:09.260 --> 02:07:09.920]
Hi Mr. Goldstein.

[02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:10.340]
How you doing?

[02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:10.920]
Hi.

[02:07:11.060 --> 02:07:15.300]
I was at your remote meal in Spex on Biscayne in North Miami Beach about a month ago.

[02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:15.860]
Yes sir.

[02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:19.100]
And I bought one of the tapes and you signed your picture for me.

[02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:24.040]
And I told you I was going to dub you a copy of a Jewish comedian.

[02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:26.820]
You passed away over like 25 years ago.

[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:30.280]
And I was wondering if I could just play a cut from that real quick.

[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:31.420]
I think you missed the goal.

[02:07:31.580 --> 02:07:33.400]
But it won't do any good on the phone.

[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:35.440]
We'll never be able to hear it on the phone.

[02:07:35.580 --> 02:07:36.080]
Believe me.

[02:07:36.180 --> 02:07:37.160]
It won't go over.

[02:07:37.620 --> 02:07:37.840]
Really?

[02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:39.580]
It's a, it's Al Sherman.

[02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:41.660]
Like Bob Lee did the album.

[02:07:42.220 --> 02:07:43.760]
A lot of the 40 pounds away.

[02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:44.480]
He's the hampoint right?

[02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:46.380]
Hello, mother.

[02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:46.780]
Yeah.

[02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:47.220]
Hello, honey.

[02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:48.240]
I got all that stuff.

[02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:50.600]
I was going to play sticks and stunts.

[02:07:50.780 --> 02:07:51.380]
I got it.

[02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:52.260]
Got it already?

[02:07:52.420 --> 02:07:52.580]
Yeah.

[02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:54.580]
So I shouldn't dub you a copy.

[02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:55.540]
No, I don't.

[02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:56.480]
Dub me anyway.

[02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:56.740]
Whatever.

[02:07:56.740 --> 02:07:57.220]
You've got.

[02:07:57.380 --> 02:07:58.060]
I don't have all of them.

[02:07:58.100 --> 02:07:59.700]
But I do have an album with some of this stuff.

[02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:02.200]
I have my son, the folks, singer and my son, the nut.

[02:08:02.660 --> 02:08:03.440]
You have those two?

[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:03.900]
No.

[02:08:04.540 --> 02:08:04.800]
Okay.

[02:08:04.980 --> 02:08:05.960]
I'll dub them for you.

[02:08:06.060 --> 02:08:06.800]
You don't want to hear it?

[02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:07.380]
No.

[02:08:07.740 --> 02:08:08.440]
Dub them for me.

[02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:09.460]
I'll play him off the tape.

[02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:10.260]
It's over the phone.

[02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:11.460]
It's like a total waste.

[02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:11.720]
Yeah.

[02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:12.620]
Sounds Aussie.

[02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:13.020]
Yeah.

[02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:16.600]
I'd like to congratulate you on the Camilla House reaching 80,000.

[02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:17.400]
I think that's great.

[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:17.880]
Thank you.

[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.460]
No, we got a ton of mail here in Alice coming through with another 500 for us.

[02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:23.180]
So, um, we're way over 80.

[02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:25.660]
I'm probably over 82,000 as we speak right now.

[02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:26.240]
We're doing great.

[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:26.760]
Excellent.

[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:28.660]
I think you'll reach your 100,000 mark.

[02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:29.040]
No problem.

[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:29.500]
Real soon.

[02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:29.840]
Okay.

[02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:30.420]
Thanks a lot.

[02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:30.960]
Thanks, Neil.

[02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:33.600]
142 at WIOD.

[02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:37.700]
We have an open line in Broward, 5241 in Palm Beach, 655.

[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:41.820]
Now, if you don't succeed in Broward, you could always move to Palm Beach because that's

[02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:42.500]
real desperate.

[02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:43.960]
Talk about Geriadria.

[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:44.860]
Talk about Deadlin.

[02:08:44.980 --> 02:08:46.040]
But that's the wealthy place.

[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:46.540]
Right?

[02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:48.400]
What are you talking about, wealthy?

[02:08:48.460 --> 02:08:49.140]
Palm Beach.

[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:51.980]
Palm Beach is a size of this room.

[02:08:52.180 --> 02:08:55.560]
Palm Beach is just a handful of wealthy, but a Kennedy compound.

[02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:57.580]
An SD louder and a few of those people.

[02:08:58.240 --> 02:08:59.340]
West Palm Beach, forget it.

[02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:00.960]
They're all slippers in West Palm Beach.

[02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:04.340]
And Bokal and Tana, Bointin Beach would be...

[02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:05.200]
But Palm Beach is a...

[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:05.700]
Virgin territory.

[02:09:05.820 --> 02:09:08.080]
Palm Pino is a sort of the poor place, right?

[02:09:08.100 --> 02:09:08.940]
And the median age...

[02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:11.400]
And I'll say, if you don't make it in Palm Beach, then you'll move south.

[02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:12.360]
You go to Halendale.

[02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:13.520]
Now, you would be big.

[02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:18.440]
If only sunny Rosenberg were still there, I would draft you to run for mayor of Halendale

[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:22.060]
because the median age in Halendale is Methusel.

[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:24.000]
I mean, 800 years past death.

[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:24.780]
It's incredible.

[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:26.620]
In fact, Halendale is where...

[02:09:26.620 --> 02:09:29.220]
We have the one guy here who wants MTV on a cable.

[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:30.020]
Oh, I saw that.

[02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:31.560]
And he raised a big stimulus because...

[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:33.040]
In fact, he works on the coast of here.

[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:34.700]
He works on our sister station on the weekend.

[02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:36.760]
He started to big to do because he lives in Halendale.

[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:38.020]
And he's still alive.

[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:39.360]
He's in his 20s or whatever.

[02:09:39.660 --> 02:09:40.380]
He wants MTV.

[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:43.840]
They don't want him to have it because they don't want it.

[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:44.680]
That's how three people do it.

[02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:47.640]
I think they got the Mazurong channel in Hollywood in Halendale.

[02:09:48.860 --> 02:09:49.220]
Plantation.

[02:09:49.940 --> 02:09:51.020]
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:51.660]
Yes, sir.

[02:09:52.100 --> 02:09:52.600]
How are you doing?

[02:09:53.220 --> 02:09:55.760]
I have a couple of questions to share if I'll...

[02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:56.000]
Thank you.

[02:09:56.060 --> 02:09:56.200]
Yes.

[02:09:56.580 --> 02:10:00.500]
Have you ever gone past the swap shop on the center of Boulevard?

[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:00.860]
Yes.

[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:06.220]
Those ESOs out there, who's paying them?

[02:10:08.180 --> 02:10:09.440]
And why are they there?

[02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:11.940]
Well, it's got a quizzical look.

[02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:13.000]
What's wrong with the sunset?

[02:10:13.460 --> 02:10:13.580]
The sunset.

[02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:15.400]
The sunset, the sunset, the place is mod.

[02:10:15.660 --> 02:10:16.840]
They have...

[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:18.160]
The flea market, Thunderbird Driving.

[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:21.140]
And they have BSO pigs who stand out there

[02:10:21.140 --> 02:10:24.020]
and help traffic cross because it's always...

[02:10:24.020 --> 02:10:26.180]
Traffic backs up and pedestrians are crossing.

[02:10:26.180 --> 02:10:27.860]
It's a mob scene, especially on Sunday.

[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:29.300]
I think on weekends is when I do it.

[02:10:29.700 --> 02:10:32.500]
And I think what he's asking is, are they on duty or off duty?

[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:33.380]
Or what is the deal?

[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:34.080]
Well, we'll find out.

[02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:35.420]
I guarantee you when I take over,

[02:10:35.420 --> 02:10:36.500]
we're going to look into this.

[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:37.460]
Yeah, I mean...

[02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:40.620]
You rest assured that this will not be nepotism.

[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:42.980]
And we're going to run it like we run a business.

[02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:46.000]
I mean, anybody can stand out there and point the finger in front of...

[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:50.140]
I'll bet that somebody's being paid high hourly wages based on the way Nick operates.

[02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:52.880]
There's probably Nick's family on the dough.

[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:56.920]
You said I didn't hear the whole broadcast,

[02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:58.600]
but anything you said is...

[02:10:58.600 --> 02:10:59.240]
It's been a while.

[02:10:59.460 --> 02:11:00.400]
I did not run again.

[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:01.240]
You would not run?

[02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:03.640]
It would depend on who would replace him.

[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:07.720]
The real issue for me is that Nick is so stupid and so pro-censorship.

[02:11:08.020 --> 02:11:13.420]
And so anti-pleasure and is such a busy body about other people's mobility.

[02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:19.140]
That it's really an easily-drowing confrontation of me representing individuality.

[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:24.300]
Individuality of freedom and him representing the old values of repression.

[02:11:24.820 --> 02:11:27.500]
So if he's gone, it's not going to be as clearly drawn

[02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:30.680]
unless the other candidates are clones of him.

[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:35.560]
And again, my main campaign will be let's fight crime in the Sheriff's Office.

[02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:37.200]
Because that's where all the crime seems to be.

[02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:40.380]
He's monopolizing crime.

[02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:42.180]
Everyone's undertaken.

[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:42.800]
Not everyone.

[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:45.400]
It seems to be many people are undertaken as an office.

[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:49.320]
And he has reversals of things he's done.

[02:11:49.460 --> 02:11:50.600]
He's totally inept.

[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:51.940]
And he's cheating the taxpayer.

[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:57.260]
So, but for me, I do pray he stays in the race so we can have...

[02:11:57.260 --> 02:11:59.100]
And this is going to be a media celebrity.

[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:00.400]
Which you already attained that.

[02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:02.080]
So you don't have to spend any of your time working.

[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:02.400]
Exactly.

[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:06.100]
And again, he may be trying to earn money.

[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:08.740]
I enter the campaign as a millionaire.

[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:10.860]
So I don't have to be in for sale.

[02:12:10.860 --> 02:12:12.360]
Because I have my money.

[02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:15.380]
I will run a clean legitimate Sheriff's Office.

[02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:17.280]
Something which hasn't been done for years.

[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:18.740]
Well, you have my vote.

[02:12:18.900 --> 02:12:19.680]
Thanks very much.

[02:12:19.900 --> 02:12:20.000]
Thanks.

[02:12:20.140 --> 02:12:21.400]
One last question.

[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:23.300]
As far as your...

[02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:26.340]
The beat is concerned with the spring break and all that.

[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:28.240]
How would you approach that?

[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:32.000]
Well, I don't know what the Sheriff can do except to me.

[02:12:32.460 --> 02:12:36.660]
I would try to have a conducive atmosphere for people who want to have a good time.

[02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:41.160]
And if somebody does damage to other people's property, there are laws on the books.

[02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:43.420]
I mean, it's just respecting other people's property.

[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:45.860]
People having a good time with...

[02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:51.280]
Someone with some pretty women running around and string bikinis or guys dressed sexually.

[02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:52.560]
What's wrong with that?

[02:12:52.780 --> 02:12:53.900]
Let's have good times.

[02:12:53.940 --> 02:12:55.120]
There's nothing wrong with it.

[02:12:55.460 --> 02:12:57.180]
There's nothing sinful and pleasure.

[02:12:57.580 --> 02:12:58.120]
I agree.

[02:12:58.220 --> 02:12:58.920]
I agree completely.

[02:12:59.260 --> 02:13:00.080]
You are...

[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:01.860]
I'm not sure if this is...

[02:13:01.860 --> 02:13:02.620]
This means true.

[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:04.260]
Are the beats as close as that night?

[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:07.040]
I'm not sure about that.

[02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:11.060]
Would you open up the beat to that night so anybody can walk down the beat?

[02:13:11.260 --> 02:13:12.420]
I would look at the pros and cons.

[02:13:12.540 --> 02:13:13.880]
I don't see any reason to close.

[02:13:14.100 --> 02:13:17.180]
I know the parking meters are like after what is 7 o'clock at night or something.

[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:19.460]
It's like you get your car towed away if you're parked on the beat.

[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:22.480]
Well, keep in mind, I'm going to have a lot more law enforcement manpower

[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:25.140]
because I'm going to be taking my debt...

[02:13:25.140 --> 02:13:31.360]
I'm going to be taking the deputies and the cops or the beat of checking populous clubs and listening to rock lyrics.

[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:36.700]
We're going to triple manpower because I'm going to have people enforcing laws that make sense,

[02:13:36.700 --> 02:13:41.460]
which has nothing to do with public nudities.

[02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:44.360]
You'll have to do if you put a gun in my face, you're going to be busted.

[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:47.220]
If you punch someone in the face, you're going to be busted.

[02:13:47.380 --> 02:13:48.600]
There are laws in the books for that.

[02:13:49.100 --> 02:13:49.780]
What about speeding?

[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:52.400]
I'm against speeding.

[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:54.100]
I'm also against alcoholic drivers.

[02:13:54.500 --> 02:14:00.720]
I think if you get busted for driving while in toxin, the case that you should lose your driver's license, you do damage.

[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:04.540]
I mean, I've got to tell you, I'm not going to pussy foot around a lot of issues.

[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:06.400]
I want to say what I believe in.

[02:14:06.820 --> 02:14:09.600]
And the issue is drunk drivers are irresponsible.

[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:10.680]
They kill people.

[02:14:10.820 --> 02:14:13.300]
And if you drive while drunk, you don't drive anymore.

[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:17.100]
That's where law makes sense.

[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:22.080]
But worried about somebody and the topless club showing pubic hairs.

[02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:22.920]
That's nonsense.

[02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:26.040]
Everyone in that club is an adult.

[02:14:26.260 --> 02:14:27.580]
They chose and they go in there.

[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:28.980]
I don't want to have my company.

[02:14:34.780 --> 02:14:37.760]
I'm not in favor of nihilism.

[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:39.120]
I'm not in favor of anarchy.

[02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:43.320]
But let's not waste our time worried about string bikinis.

[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:45.080]
Yeah, very good.

[02:14:45.500 --> 02:14:46.420]
Thank you very much.

[02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:47.440]
Okay, have a good one.

[02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:49.180]
148 in WI.

[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:51.020]
They will come back with El Goldstein right now.

[02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:52.160]
Great.

[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:52.980]
We love sound advice.

[02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:53.780]
One of our sponsors.

[02:14:54.020 --> 02:14:55.160]
Anyway, it's 150 dollars.

[02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:57.940]
It's been $4,000.

[02:14:58.440 --> 02:14:58.960]
The salesman was $4,000.

[02:14:58.960 --> 02:14:58.960]

[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:00.740]
I was Mike and my installation is Saturday.

[02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:03.640]
A 35 inch mix of bishie.

[02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:04.500]
Directing.

[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:07.160]
I have rear projection, extra speakers.

[02:15:07.700 --> 02:15:08.620]
It's going to sound great.

[02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:09.960]
Saturday is the installation.

[02:15:10.140 --> 02:15:10.660]
They were very good.

[02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:13.000]
Now you're going to be watching a Bambi Woods on it.

[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:14.080]
What's Peter North?

[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:16.120]
Yeah, I want to hear a row.

[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:19.380]
Now that should be the new surround sound.

[02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:20.440]
Surround sound.

[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:21.620]
Yeah, it could be.

[02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:24.840]
And if we elect the album, they did.

[02:15:25.340 --> 02:15:25.620]
Exactly.

[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:26.180]
Okay.

[02:15:26.180 --> 02:15:27.140]
Now you're talking.

[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:28.680]
We just got another 10,000 votes.

[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:29.760]
North Miami Beach.

[02:15:29.940 --> 02:15:32.580]
You've done a few interviews and you were half of a pretty friendly.

[02:15:32.820 --> 02:15:33.180]
It's true.

[02:15:33.180 --> 02:15:37.560]
Half once owned a hotel down here called the Playboy Plaza.

[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:42.640]
How would you feel about getting involved with kind of an adult club,

[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:47.180]
mid-night blues, screw magazine type of a resort environment?

[02:15:48.420 --> 02:15:51.040]
I'm a beach in Miami Beach where everything goes.

[02:15:51.380 --> 02:15:52.420]
No, no, I'm in favor of it.

[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:53.520]
I think it makes a lot of sense.

[02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:54.940]
How can we win you?

[02:15:55.180 --> 02:15:55.800]
How can we win you?

[02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:57.540]
I'm going to give you the New York address.

[02:15:57.780 --> 02:16:01.700]
If this point, I don't want to give my home address because I'll get in and dated.

[02:16:02.100 --> 02:16:06.360]
But if you wrote to me, I'll go to the scene at 116 West 14th Street.

[02:16:06.580 --> 02:16:07.480]
It's still up 14th Street.

[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:11.760]
116 West 14th Street, New York City 10011.

[02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:14.060]
New York City 10011.

[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:15.180]
It would reach me.

[02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:16.080]
It's very faxically.

[02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:16.680]
Okay.

[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:22.560]
Again, because I don't have political headquarters and I'd like to have my home address at this point,

[02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:23.900]
a little private.

[02:16:23.900 --> 02:16:28.400]
Do you have a reach number or reach address or even a post office?

[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:32.900]
Or you call my office and get the fax number 212-989-8001.

[02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:34.440]
That's the fax number?

[02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:35.800]
No, that's the office number.

[02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:38.360]
229-898001.

[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:42.480]
It's for you that Judith's a rob in my secretaries and they'll give you the fax number.

[02:16:42.580 --> 02:16:44.220]
Could I leave a number for you to leave?

[02:16:44.220 --> 02:16:44.740]
Yes, sure.

[02:16:44.780 --> 02:16:45.700]
You'll be a engineer.

[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:48.060]
Perhaps give me a call after the show.

[02:16:48.060 --> 02:16:48.620]
Thank you very much.

[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:49.120]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

[02:16:50.100 --> 02:16:50.240]
I'm sorry.

[02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:50.800]
I'm sorry.

[02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:50.800]

[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:51.360]
You're worth.

[02:16:51.600 --> 02:16:52.160]
Thank you very much.

[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:52.900]
Thank you.

[02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:53.680]
That's on three, George.

[02:16:53.820 --> 02:16:55.640]
You want to take that to Farrell Online 3?

[02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:56.180]
You got a number.

[02:16:56.720 --> 02:16:56.940]
Mobile.

[02:16:58.140 --> 02:16:58.580]
Hello.

[02:16:58.900 --> 02:16:59.600]
How you doing?

[02:16:59.900 --> 02:17:00.600]
I'm doing great.

[02:17:00.740 --> 02:17:02.140]
It's a pleasure to talk to both of you.

[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:06.600]
I just wanted to ask now, I read the books by Gay Khalise, by neighbor.

[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:07.340]
Right.

[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:08.280]
Yes, I mean.

[02:17:08.620 --> 02:17:11.940]
And yeah, you are at it and it was very interesting reading about you.

[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:15.600]
He mentions that you have a certain fill with your tongue.

[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:17.160]
Yes, I do.

[02:17:17.380 --> 02:17:20.300]
I was wondering how you became so adaptable.

[02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:21.120]
He is a practice.

[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:25.680]
I had the calling and I worked at it and one has to make a commitment.

[02:17:26.140 --> 02:17:29.540]
And I did the Jane Fondle work at all the time.

[02:17:29.700 --> 02:17:30.320]
Thank you.

[02:17:30.580 --> 02:17:31.060]
Okay.

[02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:31.880]

[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:33.620]
Fort Lauderdale.

[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:35.160]
Hello.

[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:37.040]
Is that the clicking line?

[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:37.580]
Okay.

[02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:38.940]
Carl Springs.

[02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:40.000]
Yeah.

[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:40.740]
Al?

[02:17:41.140 --> 02:17:41.520]
Yeah, hi.

[02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:46.220]
Do you have a yourself of a large question of one of the patients?

[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:47.280]
Not really.

[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:52.260]
You know, when it becomes a business, when you do it professionally, it doesn't have

[02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:54.560]
the excitement because now it represents work for me.

[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:56.540]
I have a monthly column in Penn House.

[02:17:56.720 --> 02:17:58.240]
I have a monthly column in Porm also.

[02:17:58.940 --> 02:18:03.560]
But if you do it for a living, I just think for me it's more of a job.

[02:18:04.140 --> 02:18:04.400]
Correct.

[02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:07.520]
It's harder to get the, my dog fell down.

[02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:09.740]
It's harder to get the fantasy going.

[02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:15.960]
When I was 32 and started screw, I was much more a point of file.

[02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:17.960]
I was a point of file.

[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:18.980]
I really loved it.

[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:22.960]
And now I'm like really just an old Jew who wants to have lean pastrami.

[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:23.900]
Okay.

[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.400]
Well, I have to give you a said, you ever seen?

[02:18:26.100 --> 02:18:27.540]
I think I met movie at art.

[02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:31.160]
Well, if you ever seen or heard of a movie that was so weird or bizarre that you couldn't believe

[02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:32.740]
yourself, I'm coming really bizarre.

[02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:34.300]
Well, yeah.

[02:18:34.460 --> 02:18:41.560]
We had a woman named Honey Suckled Divine who could shoot Jurgenslotion 20 to 30 feet across

[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:41.980]
a room.

[02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:46.220]
She could put candles out and hit you in the eye and she would use her vagina.

[02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:48.120]
And that was really weird.

[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:52.320]
And then she would vacuum using a photo shame or other time.

[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:53.780]
Anyway, the next show.

[02:18:54.140 --> 02:18:54.740]
Great show.

[02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:55.400]
Thank you, wow.

[02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:55.720]
Thank you.

[02:18:55.860 --> 02:18:57.780]
Sheriff Allen who tomorrow will be with us.

[02:18:57.860 --> 02:18:58.700]
We'll make an appearance.

[02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:00.520]
We'll be eating like a hazard.

[02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:04.600]
At 5426 North University, drive the brand new charcoal.

[02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:07.220]
Just out the commercial Boulevard on the east side of the university.

[02:19:07.220 --> 02:19:09.500]
We'll be there doing our whole show tomorrow from 10 to 2.

[02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:10.400]
Come on out.

[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:12.940]
We're going to have some great giveaways on our drawings.

[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:15.900]
And we'll have those new algal stint for sure of t-shirts.

[02:19:15.900 --> 02:19:20.120]
We'll be raising money for communal sauce with our other t-shirts and tapes and all that stuff.

[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:22.080]

Rick and Spod are going to be along with the old idiot on the corner and a bunch of real wild amazing stuff this afternoon.

Hurricane Hotline, the latest on audio to Sam Jankovitz and what's going to happen to you.

[02:19:33.940 --> 02:19:36.160]
We're sure it will be a big topic conversation tonight.
