[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:03.540]
you know i had a radio accident here on the turnpike just north of open park highway

[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:09.040]
open park highway that's in Florida medical center uh went out all the old people from

[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:15.960]
allen dales now a highway is it really you need it uh in any case i was listening to you as i

[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:22.040]
usually do and paying the tolls that are over inflated on the turnpike and i passed a radio station

[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:31.900]
w r b d 1470 on your dial yeah rocking big daddy that's the one yeah and they completely

[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:36.660]
drown you out on my radio yeah for about for about a block what it was great and i turned back

[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:41.600]
to the station 1470 just to see how far these guys go yeah they didn't make it the Florida

[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:48.700]
medical center one block that's why they don't show up in a ratings that's all i have Neil okay see

[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:53.000]
up yeah there's a lot of those stages cause you've heard of drive thros at fast food joints these

[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.980]
are drive-by's you have to drive by the tower in order to hear them i don't want to mention any other

[00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:02.780]
ones that do by the way in spite of what some hosts have said erroneously i mean i'm sure it wasn't

[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:07.940]
alive it just must be a lack of technical knowledge all directional stations a m stations change

[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:13.720]
pattern at sundown sundown of course changes each month depending upon the time of year and as

[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:17.440]
any idiot knows november december jayne where for berigit at this time of the year the days are

[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:22.900]
shorter and sundown is earlier right like this month it's about five fifteen something like that

[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:28.100]
and as a result those stations that are a little more powerful the daytime sometimes much more

[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:33.460]
powerful might come sundown uh whoop there they go and all this hum and puking and crapping

[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:37.720]
depending on where your listening starts coming in so anybody that knives that is either an

[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:43.900]

[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:30.040]
I said well let's assume for a minute that what you say is true where do you come in because if

[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:34.280]
if let's assume half your audience wants their mind stimulated you waste an all that electricity

[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.680]

[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:06.760]
them I know that you know going to the sawgrass mall is like going to Disney World there's a line

[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.840]
everywhere although it's not that bad now as it wasn't the beginning but we know we went

[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:17.160]
early we went at 10 o'clock yeah and it wasn't too bad then but the guy one of the guys in the

[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:23.500]
food court told me that they're sitting on the floor eating because it does get pretty crowded

[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:30.100]
we were lucky to find a place to sit yesterday yeah it's it's great though you know you just

[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:35.260]
go with the flow all these people that say oh no big deal I mean what do they want it's not

[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:39.980]
you know most of the other malls have basically the same kind of stores and the same stuff this

[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:43.480]

We were on the ground, we're always in control

[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:05.800]
And when you say Miami, you're talking super cool

[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:10.740]
Because we're the Miami dog food, my every dog food

[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:13.600]

So that's a go, I talked to the event, of course, is in charge of the entire radio station

[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.960]
And she said no problem, we'll get it all set up, we'll get all the sizes

[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.260]
And the t-shirts too

[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.140]
And here's a little card, isn't that something?

[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.120]
Oh, this is before the, looking forward to seeing you

[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.980]
It's for what kind of male delivery is this?

[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.120]
Oh, she had no zip code, that's why it took longer

[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.380]
She mailed it on November 6th, though, six days ago

[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:32.040]
Oh, it was my back in 185

[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:36.080]
Oh yeah, when we last got that free, I get time

[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:44.380]
There must be a better way, then always asking us to pay

[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:50.300]
Don't raise the rates, cause if you do, I've got a pitfall

[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.800]
You're let he will too

[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.500]
You always keep me waiting, Mr. Postman

[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.700]
Oh, it's all constricted, mate

[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:04.020]
I said my hands, I'll get well later

[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.520]
But when he got that, she was already dead

[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.220]
Please, Mr. Postman

[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:12.440]
But man, I'm so poor, yeah

[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.340]
I get a point, even please, please

[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:19.500]
Mr. Postman, I want to see you make me nervous

[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.820]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:23.540]
It's not that simple, how bad you're serving

[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.740]
We're paying more, you're doing less

[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.920]
Soon you'll cost more than federal extra-hairs

[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.680]
You raise the rates, but service ain't faster

[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.800]
I'll tell you where you can skip your left-hairs

[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.580]
Rates are rising, rates are rising

[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.760]
Rates are rising, rates are rising

[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.320]
Rates are rising, rates are rising

[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.540]
Rates are rising, rates are rising

[00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:59.680]
Rates are rising, rates are rising

[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.360]
Rates are rising, rates are rising

[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:00.580]
Rates are rising, rates are rising

[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:00.940]
Rates are rising, rates are rising

[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.060]
140 at WIB, we have an open line in Palm Beach

[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:07.200]

[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:11.680]
Yeah, can you tell the DJ to play a Vicky Car, must be him?

[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.180]

Okay, we'll get that right on for you

[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.220]
142 at WIOD, call from Orlando?

[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:17.860]
Yeah

[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:18.880]
Orlando?

[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.140]
Yep, how you doing, Tony?

[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.520]
I'm missing the boat here, what happened with F-T-L

[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.760]
F-T-L?

[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:27.280]
Yeah, Steve's on or something?

[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.400]
Yeah, Steve's on from two to six in the afternoon

[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.020]
You can pick it up on your pop-up toaster

[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.200]
Who else is on?

[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.600]
That's it, they're playing big bands the rest of the day

[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.620]
Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller

[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.460]
Vicky Car, and it must be him

[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.240]
Johnny Mattress, and it must be it

[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.500]
What do you think about Madden and Summerall?

[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:50.160]
You like them?

[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.680]
Great, I think

[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.860]
That Summerall is outstanding, he's great

[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.760]
John Madden is hysterical, knowledgeable, but funny is all get out

[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.120]
that they're good, they're at the best

[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.900]
Walsh is an old fart, he does

[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.640]
Walsh is just, oh, he's got a personality

[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.980]
like a dead frog in heat, man

[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.420]
and he is just terminal

[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:09.680]
That was a good game yesterday

[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.660]
I mean, the first half was sloppy, but the verdict was in doubt

[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.340]
You know, there were a lot of exciting plays

[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.800]
He doesn't know what Zellbo from is that?

[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.720]
Exactly, in fact, if you notice

[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:23.000]
you never saw Zellbo the whole game, so maybe he was sitting on it

[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:23.840]
I'll see you

[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.380]
Okay, that was from Orlando, are you serial?

[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.660]
Or was that just, it was collect?

[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:28.700]
Huh

[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.360]
Well, he shouldn't have anything exciting to say

[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.960]
like I'm up here in Orlando, and it's Mickey Mouse World

[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.720]
and everything, nothing, just like a regular call, what a guy

[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.880]
Okay, we've got five calls left on air, six now

[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.940]
I think that might carry us through the rest of the show

[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.380]
We could play that new Nelson record

[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:47.440]
after the reign, the title cut, which is their new single, but we're not going to do it

[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.380]
They're going to be here, don't forget the end of December

[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.580]
All your real horny people out there

[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.120]
Thank God I'm not ready to see them

[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:58.100]
They're going to be here December, okay, 30th and the 31st New Year's Eve

[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:01.380]
And we're going to try desperately to get them here into the studio

[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:02.420]
and maybe never let them out

[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.380]
Maybe we can auction them off for Camilla's house

[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:05.580]
Huh?

[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.680]
Boy, I know who's going to make the first bid on that

[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:10.920]
Miami, where's my checkbook?

[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:11.500]
Hey Neil

[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.220]
Hey, how about another Larry King's spy report?

[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.180]
Are you ready for this one?

[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.300]
I don't know if I'm ready or not, you know Larry

[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.640]
I called him up first ever

[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.760]
and I was talking to him and he goes, yeah, I love Miami

[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:23.880]
You know how you always said

[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:24.440]
Yeah

[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.620]
And then I hit him with a line and said

[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.120]
If I was you, what would I say to Neil Rogers?

[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.080]
And he already did

[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:34.100]
Thank you, lovely reading

[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:35.020]
Yeah

[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:38.840]
He hung up and then I had to turn the radio on real quick

[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.180]
Yeah

[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:43.000]
And he was saying Neil Rogers, I haven't heard about that guy

[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.060]
Since he was doing baseball

[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:46.860]
Yeah, blow me 50 dollars

[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.140]
Unbelievable, that's usually one of his line

[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.040]
Either that I want to be a harness race driver

[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.940]
I was doing baseball, a UM baseball

[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.880]
He likes to pretend that I'm some little underling somewhere

[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.640]
That's making about a buck and a half an hour

[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.420]
And they can't have two nickels to rub together

[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:02.740]
I'm just jealous of him and his big schnauzerness suspenders

[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:05.220]
And the sloped shoulders, but that's what I think

[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:06.620]
Quite frankly, all, you know

[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.980]
Hey, let me tell you something

[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:11.580]
Hey, you know that commercial you have for Giffy Loub?

[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:15.040]
Did you have to go to Giffy Loub to get a Giffy Loub?

[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:16.460]
Have a nice day pal

[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.220]
145 at WID, no wonder Larry gave him a rough time

[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:21.700]
I don't blame him, I said Jackass

[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.660]
Where should we take our next one from?

[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.700]
How about a mobile in Boka on the Starline?

[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.280]
That's me, what's happening Neil?

[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.380]
We're here, we're ready for it

[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:34.060]
You guys are doing great in the ring, congratulations

[00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:35.700]
Has it not come as a major shock?

[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:36.820]
No, not all

[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.740]
Of course not, we knew we were kicking it

[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:39.020]
That's right

[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:40.540]
And tell by all the Black and Blue marks

[00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:43.480]
Look at that, suds is eating subway today

[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.360]
I can't believe it, he's in there eating subway before he goes on the air

[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.060]
I cannot believe it, what is it?

[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.940]
It's a sub, of course

[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.280]
What kind?

[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.060]
What kind is it?

[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.200]
What kind is it?

[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.100]
Otuna, ooh

[00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.540]
Okay, go ahead, I feel better now

[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:02.600]
I mean lunch with Tommy Denenberg today

[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:05.560]
Sir, I'm going out to a little sup and salad place today

[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:08.380]
I just wanted to bitch about the police again

[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.860]
Yeah

[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:12.820]
Because up there in Florida they give me a ticket at 123 am

[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:15.220]
Yeah, when I'm sure there was a lot of traffic around

[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:16.000]
Exactly

[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.640]
And danger in everyone's life

[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.880]
It was worse than that, I was parked at confetti's

[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:24.140]
And they're parking me, they have a two per limit on the meters

[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:27.440]
Who stays in a club for two hours on a Saturday night?

[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:27.860]
Exactly

[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:31.680]
I mean the strip shop in center is no merchant, there's no nothing

[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.880]
You can't put like $5 in the machine

[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.620]
Because they're not going to turn the damn knob

[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:36.000]
Yeah

[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000]
And they say they're just a bunch of complete morons

[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.060]
I like to call the meter made a douchebag

[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:43.440]
But they only put their names on the ticket anymore

[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.780]
Well, that's miss douchebag to you, sir

[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:49.780]
So I just want to get that off my chest and you guys are kicking ass and keep it up

[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:50.700]
Have a great life, pal

[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:51.020]
You too

[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.240]
So you haven't heard this in a long time

[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:53.580]
Oh

[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:57.880]
He is still world's biggest asshole

[00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.680]
Tom Denenberg

[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.360]
Tom Denenberg

[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.400]
Great reading, great

[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:03.880]
Thank you

[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:04.440]
You're back here

[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.840]
Okay, 147

[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:10.220]
13-2 on your incredible station, 6-10

[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:11.260]
How's the tuna?

[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:12.940]
Tuna, sub

[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.480]
Oh, geez, that's a goyish, I think

[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.000]
Yeah

[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:18.740]
6-10

[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.560]
Toppy on D

[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.520]
From the producers of Rescue 911

[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.840]
Comes an all-new emergency drama

[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:26.900]
We've got difference

[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:27.940]
Yes

[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:29.920]
Help me, I've been shot

[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.380]
Help me, I've been shot

[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:36.240]
The show were victims of mindless violence compete for valuable cash prizes

[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.200]
Where have you been shot?

[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.140]
I in the buttock

[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.780]
That doesn't sound very interesting, sir

[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:40.840]
Well, there's a lot of blood

[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.300]
Oh, good, don't touch anything

[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:42.860]
Okay

[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.020]
Remember, these are not re-enactments

[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:48.160]
These are actual people who've been shot by actual guns

[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.080]
And you'll see it live on tape

[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.920]
On help me, I've been shot

[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.080]
You guys better hurry, I'm fading fast

[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.260]
Don't worry, sir, the camera crew is on its way

[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.960]
Is this mean I win the $10,000?

[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.600]
We'll let our studio audience be the judge of that, sir

[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.080]
Help me, I've been shot

[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.780]
The audience participation show

[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.880]
Where a bullet in the butt can mean money in the bank

[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.040]
Sunday night on five

[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:07.820]
Poppano

[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:08.780]
Is this now?

[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:09.600]
Yes, sir

[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.840]
No, this is super good

[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:11.780]
Oh

[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.840]
Here's a mobile jets fan

[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:15.960]
Yeah

[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.860]
You guys did it to me again

[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:18.700]
Yeah

[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.700]
I was drinking, taking you with me, my hands off, dear

[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:25.220]
I went to the game, let me tell you something outside to state him

[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:26.200]
It was freezing

[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.360]
The wind was blowing, it was unbelievable

[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.460]
It was incredible

[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.060]
I was down in the end zone, I was right down in the corner end zone

[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:35.340]
I've seen where the, you know, that disputed play was

[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.240]
But what are you gonna do?

[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.180]
Yeah, it didn't make any difference

[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:40.600]
You know, Bill Walsh kept ripping quarterbacks for bad passes

[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:44.160]
But the fact is that with that wind blow and it's a miracle, anybody completed anything

[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:44.480]
All right

[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.740]
The wind was just going nuts

[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.800]
It was unbelievable, I didn't think it would be that cold

[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.040]
But it was, it was like a buffalo

[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.940]
But, you know, probably not as cold up there

[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.940]
Didn't you see the tapes from the buffalo game?

[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.720]
I see it, I see it when I got back back

[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.360]
Oh, I know, I believe whatever it was at East Rutherford

[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.680]
Was nothing compared to Buffalo

[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.540]
I mean, it was snow and sleet

[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:06.760]
And just wind was, it looked like Windsor Ontario on a bad day

[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.420]
Now I'm from Utica, so I know how that weather

[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:09.740]
There you go, same difference

[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.320]
But, uh, well, you guys beat us twice this year

[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:15.900]
Well, once the ghost of Joe Walton and Lou Holt's kind of

[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.540]
Disappear fate in the woodwork, you guys will make a comeback

[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:20.180]
Right, well, I'll raise you next year

[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.280]
Okay, okay, buddy
