[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.640]
Matter of fact, I'm going to be as guest of the last two hours on Monday.

[00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.860]
There's a plug.

[00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:05.360]
On Steve?

[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:05.920]
Yeah.

[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.780]
Four to six.

[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.900]
Are you serial?

[00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.360]
Yeah.

[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.660]
You want to make it more like I just can't get out of it.

[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.040]
Well, maybe they can simul cast it and interject if you comment or something.

[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.280]

[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.160]
Well, I just want to make it clear right at the outset that Tom and I have been doing these

[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.660]
shows for about 10, 11 years now.

[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.920]
I can reach as low as I can.

[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.980]
And we've had our moments, especially when your wife got psychotic.

[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.060]
Yeah, just read with something you wrote and she had the near-rangers booted on and

[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.940]
were sticking pins with it.

[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.980]
I always think these are about that.

[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.200]
But basically, Tom and I get along great and we'll continue to do so.

[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.960]
And we have some very strong disagreements about a lot of things.

[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.880]
For example, I still am waiting for my dick cat for article to come out.

[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.560]
But I'm not going to give you a few.

[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.000]
I'm not going to get into with feud with you because you and Rick Riley hate each other

[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.700]
like poison.

[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.420]
I am fascinated.

[00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.300]
I don't understand what that's all about though.

[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.660]
Well, you were a witness to it.

[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.580]
I mean, the guy could come charge and in the other way.

[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.700]
But you hated him before that.

[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.380]
No, I didn't.

[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.320]
No, I really just liked.

[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.920]
No, I mean, I was kind of indifferent towards him.

[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.320]
He has a very abyssal.

[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.260]
Happy birthday, Avent.

[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.720]
Yeah.

[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.560]
So that's birthday.

[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.840]
By the way, is Jeff bringing food for Tom from Pizza Lawn?

[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.800]
Yeah, what are you going to say?

[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.400]
You're going to start with Phoebe's stuff, a cold.

[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.280]
I'd eat those stuff.

[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.540]
Yeah.

[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.520]
Tell him bring tons of food because Tom looks like he's starving over here.

[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.200]
You know what I say?

[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.560]
And then he came in here and acted like a total jerk.

[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.740]
And I made him up for you.

[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.760]
He was just all upset that I didn't write a column the last time he got fired at the

[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.100]
waxy.

[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.620]
And I made him a promise that when he gets fired here, I'll write a column.

[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.600]
And I doubt that there'll be one before that.

[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.200]
All right, we'll come back to that obviously and spend them more than two, three hours on

[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.320]
it.

[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.360]
But speaking of waxy.

[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.020]
Oh, I think at least cold and all.

[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.720]
I mean, at least you know, yeah, say something.

[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.780]
That was the most embarrassing and I kept waiting to hear you.

[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.000]
And I heard you're like, I mean, I just got mad at by the moment.

[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.740]
And you know, I want to say in the fence of your del.

[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.480]
I mean, he was as annoyed as I was when I walked in in the morning.

[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.220]
You know, I had to get up like quarter to five in the morning to get up there.

[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.640]
They had been promoting it all week.

[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.620]
And I walk in.

[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.980]
He shows me this memo that he's got from that program.

[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.340]
Well, that's so cool program director they have.

[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.160]
We will not discuss other stations.

[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.040]
We will not discuss other personalities.

[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.660]
We will not.

[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.600]
Well, what was there left to discuss the weather?

[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.060]
Whether we're dark or.

[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.620]
Yeah.

[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.400]
And then they would do it.

[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.440]
And Greg had hoped that morning that he would be able to do a show.

[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.980]
You know, so similar, the format wise, like to this, that they ditch some of the music

[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.420]
anyway.

[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.760]
And we talk and we talk like we do about the market and about what was going on about,

[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.680]
you know, what's his name and suds in the afternoon.

[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.320]
Well, why were you there in the first place though?

[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.300]
That's what I'm trying to understand.

[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.900]
Because there was so much music going on, especially after rate 30, which is when I was

[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.120]
legit.

[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.120]
No, it's not.

[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.160]
I'm not denying 30.

[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.160]
I don't think you said anything.

[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.440]
No.

[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.940]
And well, Greg had been asking me for a long time.

[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.080]
Could you come up and I kept putting them off and putting them off.

[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.440]
And mainly for no other reason, I had to get up at quarter to five to get up there and

[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440]
made for a real long day.

[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.540]
So finally, he called one up again and he said, listen, going in, I promise I can make

[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.740]
it.

[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.360]
So I said, okay.

[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.400]
And we made a date.

[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.520]
And you know, like I said, they promoted it all week like I was going to have a role

[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.800]
in the program and really have nothing to do.

[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.920]
They played 20 minute music breaks, they had two minutes in between.

[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.880]
And all they had was that people calling up one to know what the magic money phrase

[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.400]
or whatever it is that gimmick they do.

[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.840]
That was the only cause we got.

[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.260]
And there was other calls that got well set up, right?

[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.140]
Which ones were that?

[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.100]
Oh, there were a few calls I heard like from, oh, I don't know, different characters.

[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.620]
There was one.

[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.260]
Oh, yeah, yeah.

[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.880]
It was all set.

[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.540]
It was what's his name.

[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.020]
It was all phony.

[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.040]
And Eric Lambert called him, which I didn't hear thank God, but it was all set up stuff.

[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.320]
Yeah.

[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.060]
Yeah, there was nothing like what I thought it would be.

[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.000]
And again, it wasn't Greg's fault.

[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.900]
He thought I'd be able to for that one one and they'd make an exception, but this guy

[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.320]
runs that.

[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.720]
He's a, I talked to him after the program, not about that about other things.

[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.480]
And I, ooh, so what's going on over there?

[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.400]
What is the change?

[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.240]
Does anybody know?

[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.680]
They had a big meeting.

[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.180]
All the rumors were they're going to make a big change in the music.

[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.900]
They were a mute.

[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.180]
I mean, I'll tell you what, the one thing the program director did, he called me that

[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.320]
afternoon, even though I hadn't heard the rumors because I was in the office.

[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.020]
He says, I guess you've heard the rumors.

[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.040]
I says, no, I haven't.

[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.240]
He says, well, they're not true.

[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.360]
I says, well, what's not true?

[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.820]
And he says, when I change anything, the format's staying exactly the same.

[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.100]
Wow.

[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.400]
But I'll tell you what, what's his name left a lot of fans over there because of this

[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.600]
so-called feud that we have.

[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.040]
Rick Rally.

[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.540]
Yeah.

[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.660]
Suds Pardon.

[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.420]
All morning long, people were coming in.

[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.980]
Volunteering stories about what a rectum or a façie is.

[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.920]
I mean, just personally, after person, secretaries, cleaning people, I mean, everybody

[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.540]
over there.

[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.500]
So in other words, if they'll catch you, you hate him like Poison.

[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.660]
Everybody at Waxley hates him like you do too.

[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.020]
No, I don't hate him like Poison.

[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.900]
Close.

[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.800]
Yeah, like bad tasting medicine.

[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.220]
OK.

[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.080]
Do we have a book by the way?

[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.260]
Can we get the summer book?

[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.660]
Shall we get the book in?

[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.380]
And have you seen it?

[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.800]
The whole book?

[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.700]
I only see it.

[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.920]
They sent me the 12 plus.

[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.600]
No, that's always the whole book in here.

[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.640]
When you come here, we do it right.

[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.260]
We give you pumpkin.

[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.340]
We bring in pizza law.

[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.520]
Where do these come from?

[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.800]
The pumpkin.

[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.440]
You were at the breeder's cup.

[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.720]
Yeah.

[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.580]
All right, cried like I was thinking of you being there when I watched that.

[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.540]
I have never in all the years ever go to the track for 30 years.

[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.560]
And I've never seen so much so bad happen in such a short time.

[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.520]
Not only you had three horses destroyed,

[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.580]
and with a broken collarbone.

[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.900]
And then the finish of the first race all screwed up.

[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.360]
Because you had to go to the other job and just shout out.

[00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.600]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.240]
And it just seemed like the whole day it was like a cloud hanging over it.

[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.720]
And then they had only 50,000 people.

[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.320]
Because the weather was garbage a day before.

[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.700]
What a disaster.

[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.320]
Oh, it was just a, you know, if we don't get the breeder's cup back

[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.840]
after the last side of the day, it just was so totally unplayed.

[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.060]
When I left for the track in the morning, I left early because

[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.640]
I anticipated cry, which turned out not to be that great.

[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.720]
Anyway, it was 36 degrees.

[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.000]
That's no way that a cloud would have a good time.

[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.880]
I suppose they had seats there for 18,000 people.

[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.180]
And the worst thing that you could do, you could not sit in those seats all day long.

[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.700]
You think I sound, if you were to die from pneumonia before the afternoon was over.

[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.920]
Because the way Gulf Stream is built so that the sun is not in people's faces all day,

[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.440]
the sun sinks over the grandstand by noontime.

[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.820]
So you were an absolute shade with this wind warping by the wind shield

[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.300]
fact it had to be in the 20s.

[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.400]
Nobody with it had, you know, besides what happened on the racetrack,

[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.920]
it was impossible to have a good time.

[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.040]
You mean, you said Gulf Stream was a Freudian.

[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.260]
No, yeah. Well, like, and you know, one of the things that's kind of amusing is

[00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.440]
Gulf Stream had all those problems last year with the racetrack.

[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.820]
And who did they bring down?

[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.420]
They brought down Joe King, who does the strip at Bellmont.

[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.280]
And, you know, after what happened Saturday, you're, wow,

[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.040]
but he's the guy who's redesigning the rebuilding of Gulf Stream.

[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.520]
Oh, you were there, so you didn't see the TV thing on NBC,

[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.680]
but they kept like they were talking to a Greg MacKeran

[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.400]
who was out on the outwriter.

[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.940]
And he kept saying, well, you know, there's got to be something wrong.

[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.580]
And of course, the Dewey and Lucas went nuts,

[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.460]
took us the day before they had had horses that had that broke down.

[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.340]
Oh, two of them went dry.

[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.180]
I had one of them.

[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.260]
Yeah, why not try?

[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.720]
I had. And then Lucas lost earlier in the week.

[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.700]
A failure was a full sister at a house, but what is she worth?

[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.000]
And she broke down and he had this track of real deep.

[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.600]
I mean, you know, it's hard to tell on television, but it was awful.

[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.760]
Well, it was real sandy.

[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.200]
What, what had happened was on Monday, I didn't go up until Wednesday,

[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.200]
but on Monday, they had had seven inches of rain overnight.

[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.100]
And so they didn't really put much water into the track.

[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.480]
And so it just got real deep and sandy.

[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.380]
And it was just speaking of sand anyway.

[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.400]
Yeah.

[00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.380]
So it just wasn't good.

[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.000]
In defense of the track, you know, two of the horses who died,

[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.400]
Mr. Nickerson took a heart attack.

[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.000]
He can't blame that on the track and and shake a knit,

[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.080]
tripped over Mr. Nickerson.

[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.400]
So you can't blame that on the track.

[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.500]
But there were two that went down on Friday and the Lucas Philly.

[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.860]
And really what happened was go from one just over extended a self.

[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.320]
And the crime is that like Ruffian.

[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.260]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.440]
She racing against the cold.

[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.960]
And the crime was that that probably would have been remembered

[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.040]
as the greatest race since the firm that Allie, I had by a coer

[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.180]
and I didn't want to win.

[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.460]
I mean, when I had, I cry, I'm not ashamed to say that.

[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.820]
There wasn't a dry eye.

[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.820]
I mean, a lot of people left they said that.

[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.360]
Yeah, it just just put a poll on the day.

[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.520]
And you know, it made it worse.

[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.640]
I was outside for the race and I had binoculars on it.

[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.420]
Oh, and you know, went to one thing NBC.

[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.660]
I remember the one of the facts you were right.

[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.640]
It was over the space shuttle.

[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.120]
CBS Space Shuttle Company, right?

[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.540]
And NBC, they were right up there with CBS.

[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.800]
They showed it over and over and over.

[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.740]
And then it kept sticking to microphone in the faces of like all

[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.260]
the all the connections of Go for one.

[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.860]
The groom and the trainer and the owners.

[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.880]
And I mean, she's obviously these people

[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.600]
are going to be in shock and crying and hysterical.

[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.500]
I mean, that is a pride.

[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.860]
Oh, you watch news any night.

[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.800]
You're going to find, you know, all the way to the right.

[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.380]
You know, they have these streaks and football

[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.720]
like an end is caught a pass in 82 straight games.

[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.160]
I mean, you could do the same thing.

[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.720]
How many straight nights do you have somebody crying

[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.640]
at some point in the news?

[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.720]
I mean, it's, you know, it's very dramatic photograph.

[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.780]
But what happened was when she went down,

[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.640]
I knew I had to race one with Biocolor.

[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.160]
I had no other perfective involved.

[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.300]
I only used, so instead of watching Biocolor,

[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.020]
I kept it on her and I started to get up and try and run

[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:36.940]
with the leg flapping.

[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.140]
And I just dropped my glasses down and the tears

[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.500]
just all the horrible things.

[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.740]
And I turned around and I walked right into the stands

[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.460]
and sat down and put my head in my hands.

[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.460]
I cried.

[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.960]
And like I say, I was one of 50,000 people crying.

[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.180]
Yeah, it was terrible.

[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.820]
While there will be a lot of people crying

[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.080]
when they see the numbers in this book,

[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.540]
but you look at it while we do a little break.

[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.060]
Tom Jikers here, the radio TV writer

[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.740]
for the Fort Lauderdale News and Sunsemble,

[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.100]
Rick Riley's close personal friend.

[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.580]
It's 21 after 10 at WIOD.

[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.880]
You want to tell you about the Amadillo Cafe.

[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.780]
Now what did I do with that little thing that I had?

[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.540]
I heard him say it the other day.

[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:14.620]
Howard?

[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.040]
Yeah.

[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.000]
He's going to be on an LA.

[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.620]
Yeah, now he's on in Washington, Philadelphia, New York

[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.560]
and he's going to be on an LA.

[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.880]
I guess they're going to try and syndicate the show national.

[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:23.740]
Watch out, Reneerie.

[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.160]
Anyway, it's 1026, Tom Jikers with this now.

[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:29.480]
I'm going to where to start.

[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.200]
I really don't.

[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.240]
We did the Videl thing.

[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.440]
I don't want to spend four hours ripping Rick Riley,

[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.180]
but you do obviously.

[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.600]
Now you're looking into book.

[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.140]
Yeah, did you look at any of the numbers for the afternoon?

[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:38.760]
Did you see it?

[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.000]
Oh, and you guys really had big numbers.

[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:40.540]
Oh, they did.

[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.540]
I get about personal.

[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:41.960]
What about you?

[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:42.800]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.220]
That's what bothers a lot of people is that they feel.

[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.920]
I think this is what bothers him.

[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.200]
He can handle people hating him because a lot of people already do.

[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.800]
But when you give the impression that you allow your personal feeling

[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.920]
is to cloud your judgment.

[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.080]
In other words, you hate somebody.

[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.040]
They get a big book and you don't want to give him credit.

[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.620]
Now when you say anybody who follows Neil gets numbers,

[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.080]
why ain't nobody gets a number?

[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.900]
But the number can be like a one and then it certainly didn't get a number.

[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.460]
In fact, he brought the whole station down.

[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.460]
The station was dying.

[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.540]
Yeah, dying.

[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.620]
Well, now, Alex Benning.

[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.860]
But he shot himself and the foot.

[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.240]
He was on here and now I think every day he was leaving.

[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.540]
I understand that, but that was still a byproduct of whatever his act was.

[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.300]
And what he did and the station was dying.

[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.760]
These guys came along and it took a while.

[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.140]
It took it like anything does, but they'd like I kept saying leave somebody's,

[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.780]
you know, leave it alone for a few months and give it a chance.

[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:27.360]
Yeah.

[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.060]
And the audience likes him.

[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.560]
They love him.

[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.560]
And they're doing, you know, whether you like him or not, they're doing well.

[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.980]
First of all, and I'm not just saying because I work here,

[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.300]
because I'd be the first one to tell you that Alex was an abortion

[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.960]
and that some of the people have been on at night.

[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.400]
I don't want to mention a particular name, but I'm not too crazy about it.

[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.020]
But they're doing it.

[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:43.420]
Yeah.

[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.760]
First of all, two things.

[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.980]
One, that they got, you know, that they totally overlooked.

[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.820]
And I can't believe that it wasn't intentional.

[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.480]
Is I write an opinionated column if they don't know that.

[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.240]
Then he's an imbecile.

[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.120]
I mean, I am, I report, but I have a sig.

[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.420]
I write, I am the TV radio columnist.

[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.420]
My column, anyone who reads my column, knows opinionated every day.

[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.220]
That's first of all.

[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.020]
Second of all, he intentionally missed the point of that piece,

[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.660]
purposefully missed it.

[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.560]
And in that piece, I said they had an impressive book.

[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:12.620]
I did, right?

[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.360]
And black and white.

[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.600]
He can bring it in here and read it.

[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.580]
I said they had an impressive book.

[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.100]
What I was saying was, and the whole purpose of the, it was a small,

[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.700]
actually, wasn't even a column, was part of a column.

[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.540]
What I said was that they shot themselves in the foot.

[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.940]
He had not carrying the baseball.

[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.020]
That you want to be the sports station in town.

[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:28.820]
Well, that was a separate thing.

[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:29.800]
I said that first.

[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.760]
That was the first one to set up.

[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.800]
And everybody had an air.

[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:32.780]
And he said it on the air.

[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.400]
And bear is right.

[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.180]
And that was the point of the column.

[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.820]
But you got to remember that that's an nature of the business.

[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.500]
And again, I'm not covering up because if it was grow testically embarrassing,

[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.040]
but like I mentioned, QAM carried a meds all season long.

[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.280]
They were still in a write down at last weekend.

[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.140]
It was touch and go.

[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.200]
And then all of a sudden, the last couple of weekends,

[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.360]
they don't carry day games on a Saturday and Sunday

[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.260]
because they had one day they had FSU football or some other thing.

[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.180]
And that game, by the way, was on sports channel in New York.

[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.900]
So 99% of the people here couldn't see it.

[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:00.960]
Yeah, I'm out there.

[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.340]
Yeah, but at least they did it.

[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.160]
They had a commitment to Florida football.

[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.580]
I would rather see the meds, but you know,

[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.160]
you could make the argument more people.

[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.760]
But it was sports for sports.

[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.400]
What this was, this was the playoffs.

[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.440]
And they had you had the right.

[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.660]
If you don't carry the play, how can you call yourself the sports station

[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.100]
in black people out of the play?

[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.620]
So that was the point of the column.

[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.580]
Now I call Gary up and the reason that,

[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.940]
yeah, I got to hair up my behind because he's thought,

[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.120]
you know, generally we have a very cordial conversation,

[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.920]
but he got nasty as soon as I call up on the phone.

[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.280]
Not really.

[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.700]
Yeah, he did.

[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.660]
So and so then he says to me, he starts this crappy,

[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.480]
well, Rick and size audience wanted them on.

[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.120]
And I said, well, when was that poll taken?

[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.300]
And he says, wow, it was the rating.

[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:46.640]
So all I was saying was the point of that was that the reason

[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.300]
some stations don't want to pull somebody off the air for a couple of days,

[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.460]
is you're afraid, you know, so their audience will drift away.

[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.500]
My point was, as long as these guys are playing behind you,

[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.560]
they're not going to drift away.

[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.940]
You're going to deliver an audience.

[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.140]
They could be gone from month and the audience is going to find them again

[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.660]
because they're going to come in behind you.

[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.260]
I would tell you this, if Alex Bennett was still in the station,

[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.840]
God forbid, I'd still have a four, maybe a three by now.

[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:07.960]
I believe that.

[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:08.620]
I don't.

[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.000]
I think that book was an aberrate.

[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.560]
Now, to some extent, I mean, granted there was a lot of bad ethics

[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.260]
sampling and Brad was under sample.

[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.420]
We've been through that a million times,

[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.480]
but I'm telling you, we were going through tough times.

[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.160]
We talked about it on here every day.

[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.420]
Things are not good here.

[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.200]
Everybody was fighting with each other.

[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.320]
You can't survive that way.

[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.640]
I mean, if it's done and fun, that's one thing.

[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.540]
But it wasn't fun.

[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.500]
It was painful.

[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.800]
We excruciated.

[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:30.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.940]
And like I said, the constant hopping,

[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.100]
I'm not going to be here tomorrow.

[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.240]
And like you do things in jest.

[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.460]
I mean, he sounded every day.

[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:38.080]
He said it.

[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.000]
I thought he meant it.

[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.040]
I really did.

[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.180]
He sounded like he meant it.

[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.480]
There was no humor in it.

[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.900]
There was, you know, so.

[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.080]
But, anyway, to get back to these guys,

[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.040]
so what did they, they had a big book, right?

[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.660]
Yeah, but they just coincidentally,

[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.800]
they had a big book behind your biggest book.

[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.180]
Now, let's see if your number slipped a little bit.

[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.660]
I guarantee you there, number slips.

[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.620]
So, in other words, you don't want to give them any credit.

[00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.700]
I give them credit.

[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.100]
I'll tell you what.

[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.160]
Let me ask you this.

[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.140]
I'll translate what Rick Riley said.

[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.140]
Now, give him credit for that.

[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:06.520]
Congratulations, Rick.

[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:07.320]
You're a giant.

[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.760]
You scared away fewer of Neil's audience than Alex did.

[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.200]
All right?

[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:14.900]
That's what he's talking about.

[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.260]
Roodle.

[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.020]
That's what he did.

[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:16.380]
Roodle.

[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.720]
Alex Bennett ran away.

[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.620]
Hand of your audience.

[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.380]
They only ran away.

[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.080]
30 or 30.

[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.460]
You're going to mownue the man is still brutal.

[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.120]
It's incredible.

[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.960]
I, like I said, the other day when I put those two guys

[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.880]
behind Debbie Ellis and they're a hash mark.

[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.000]
Well, let put anybody behind Debbie Ellis

[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.340]
and that you can't even see him.

[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:30.580]
Okay?

[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.080]
You could put all these pumpkins behind Debbie.

[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:32.960]
Nobody would see him.

[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.080]
So, in other words, as far as the show is concerned,

[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.240]
forget about the personalities.

[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.700]
You think they have a bad show?

[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:38.000]
No.

[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.180]
I don't.

[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.120]
It's a show that's one old on me.

[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.180]
Maybe I'm too old for them.

[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.960]
I think, you know, I think they're talking to audience.

[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:46.700]
Well, there's no question.

[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.560]
I'm just going to have to leave more people.

[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.880]
18 to 34, I think is more than that.

[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.280]
More than that.

[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.160]
The bottom end of that.

[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.020]
And like I said, I mean, you know,

[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:53.960]
a squirt might come down.

[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.540]
Back in the middle of the 30s.

[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.460]
I think that little back can go a long way.

[00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.060]
But then again, Friday, now you weren't here.

[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.980]
I heard it was one of the greatest radio shows

[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.040]
in the history of broadcasting.

[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:02.580]
And that's it.

[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.820]
Well, I was involved in it, but because it was significant.

[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:06.520]
Well, the blinds are.

[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.080]
Squirrel finds an acorn every now and then.

[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:08.640]

[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:09.680]

[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:10.420]

[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.980]
I mean, he's the one who's right here and ripped me

[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.140]
for four hours and he ripped me over looking

[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.000]
the purpose of the column, distorting what I actually do,

[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.520]
and allowing these jerks that called up, you know,

[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.940]
to make all sorts of vile threats for four hours.

[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.040]
Threats?

[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.420]
You know, you know, somebody ought to take care of that time,

[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.440]
jicker and things like that.

[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.620]
And you know, he's the one who did it for four hours.

[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.080]
Not me.

[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.220]
And he's the one who came in here like a moron

[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.260]
the last time I was on here.

[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:34.600]
I'm under the day.

[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:35.880]
I tell you what, nobody's got that.

[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.540]
Nobody's got that.

[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.800]
The last three times I've been here, I've been attacked

[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.000]
by them.

[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.880]
Well, that's why I said that.

[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.240]
It just gets to be.

[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.720]
See, when he first came in, I didn't realize

[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.440]
that was going to happen.

[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.320]
Nobody could have known that.

[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.640]
I thought it was going to be a little fun.

[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.460]
It wasn't fun.

[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.220]
I'd be glad to sit in a microphone and debate with him,

[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.700]
you know, and, you know, person to person intelligent with.

[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.300]
But I mean, the way he came in, you know,

[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.180]
roaring and calling, you know, name calling and things like that.

[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.540]
And he's the one who did it for four hours.

[00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:59.400]
I didn't start this.

[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.720]
He's a hothead, don't you understand?

[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.060]
Exactly.

[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:01.940]
He's a hothead.

[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.320]
He's temperamentally hysterical.

[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.740]
He's a maniac, but they're kicking ass.

[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.780]
So he doing very well.

[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.100]
And I said that in the column.

[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.920]
I said they had an impressive book.

[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.360]
It's in the column.

[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.960]
Let him come in and read the column

[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.020]
and show me where that's not.

[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.340]
He can't do it.

[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.340]
It's in the column.

[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:16.880]
You feel better.

[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.580]
But he never met.

[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:17.760]
Yeah.

[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.240]
He came in here with sick as a dog.

[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.100]
Even his hair is back in place now.

[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.500]
He's like the old time jitter.

[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.140]
After another hour of this, he'll be feeling great.

[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.420]
I'm getting as hysterical as him.

[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.300]
Yeah, that's good.

[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:27.900]
We like that.

[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:28.940]
1033.

[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.600]
We got keen to talk about.

[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.760]
We got WS news.

[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.040]
God, I can't believe it.

[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.720]
I think that, and I ripped you good this last few days.

[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.080]
I heard that the guy goes up there to the breeder's couple

[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.480]
of jacket I understand, because I love racing.

[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.560]
I tripped for long.

[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.300]
I understand that.

[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.480]
But just bad timing and all of a sudden all hell breaks loose.

[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.680]
I mean, we got WS news.

[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.400]
We got Steve going back to FTL coming back on the air.

[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.720]
We got the funeral on Friday.

[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.660]
If I had Anita the size of Riley, I think that they did it

[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.320]
for that reason, because they knew I was out of town.

[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.420]
But I don't have any angle that nobody has any.

[00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.160]
He goes that's probably not even came.

[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.480]
Now you're really.

[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.760]
No, not well.

[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.820]
Now you're losing a lot more pleasant to deal with.

[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.000]
I guess Egos that it's well, this is going to see now.

[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.580]
I'm going to say this again, because I don't like getting sucked

[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.080]
into things where I take a position because somebody else

[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:13.780]
wants me to do that.

[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:14.820]
I just refuse to do that.

[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.420]
No, I'm not talking about you.

[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.160]
Keenan, I have had, as you know, times when we hate,

[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.420]
well, I can't speak for him.

[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.440]
There were times I hated the man like poison.

[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:24.540]
I mean like poison.

[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:24.820]
I know.

[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.020]
I don't, I don't, not only don't I dislike him.

[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.300]
Now he showed up at the thing on Friday.

[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:29.560]
Yeah.

[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.500]
When we got over there and we were in a big empty lot, I like Steve.

[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.180]
I know he's got people and I see a lot of people in the audience

[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.080]
and say, oh, geez, we can't believe we're saying.

[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.020]
I do not, I mean, not like a close personal friend.

[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.060]
I don't look upon him that way.

[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.320]
He's not really a bad guy.

[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.060]
He's got his things like all of us doing a business

[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:47.980]
where all of us screwy.

[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.880]
And he's his own worst enemy.

[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.040]
There's no question about that.

[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.260]
But I don't dislike him.

[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:52.640]
Yeah.

[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.060]
And that bothers some people.

[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.980]
And I'm not going to say, well, I hate him.

[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.740]
I hate you just to make anybody else happy, because I don't.

[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.900]
Well, and I don't wish anybody in the, for all the kidding

[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.580]
around I do, I want to make it clear.

[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.500]
I don't wish anybody on the talent end in this business

[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.680]
bad luck, whether it's Al.

[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.380]
Now, I like Al.

[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.000]
I mean, I give it to him all the time, but that's the business.

[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:11.760]
That's what I do.

[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.640]
Sandy, I don't even know her.

[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.520]
OK, Debbie, I've never met her in my life.

[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.640]
What do I know?

[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:17.880]
I wish all those people good luck.

[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.480]
I would like to see if I'm fine work.

[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.680]
I don't dislike it.

[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.520]
I had a little bit of a few drawn with Debbie.

[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.120]
I don't even remember how that got started.

[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.820]
But I mean, personally, I have had your blimp ever

[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:27.320]
goes down.

[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.620]
There's always something like that.

[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.040]
I mean, I hope she finds work.

[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.800]
I just hope it's somewhere far away from here.

[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.140]
Exactly.

[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.380]
1035 at WIOD with Tom Jicke.

[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.560]
And we'll be right back.

[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.680]
Yes, that's the day.

[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:41.620]
WIOD.

[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.580]
22 to 11 at WIOD.

[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.220]
Now, let's talk about WS News.

[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.980]
Like I said, you missed a great day on Friday.

[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.580]
People still work on getting laid over.

[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:49.820]
They're going on.

[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.120]
Great radio shows of all time.

[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.740]
And I went through that long list.

[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.880]
But the sad part of it is, like I said yesterday,

[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.740]
here's a guy, Dennis Collins, the general mangler over there,

[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.580]
who's been Jefferson Pyle who came into this market.

[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.540]
They bought WGBS, which was a dying giant at the time.

[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.700]
I used to be a big MOR.

[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.440]
And of course, MOR died years ago.

[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.340]
And it was dying.

[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.400]
And they bought it and they made it all talk.

[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.940]
And at that time, it was amazing.

[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.920]
We had four stations in this market doing so-called

[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.140]
topical talk.

[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:21.400]
We had INZ, this station, WGBS, and WNWS, which at that time

[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.780]
was owned by Neil Rockoff, which is also after I got out.

[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.260]
Thank God.

[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.160]
Did you have, remember, Lee knew Luke Rona,

[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.380]
and I hope you didn't leave his name now?

[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.400]
How could we leave his name?

[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.100]
I even told a story about Jerry Williams trying to turn

[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.420]
the desk over on top of him.

[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.340]
And also the birdsy of the show.

[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.320]
Oh, you were not.

[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.920]
I've ever been forcibly thrown out of a station.

[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:38.460]
Yeah.

[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.540]
And you're in the hallway hiding.

[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.860]
And he's in there screaming at me during a break.

[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:43.700]
Cut the crap.

[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.780]
It wasn't crap, but that's the closest I can say.

[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.980]
We're going to lose the license.

[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:47.460]
Cut that.

[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.040]
And I'm sitting there with a jar of birdsy,

[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.000]
which he thought was marijuana seeds and the Cursette

[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.520]
look-crunk.

[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.500]
But anyway, they ruined GBS.

[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.620]
They brought in all these losers.

[00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.920]
They brought in the David Gold.

[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.600]
And well, that was foul as doing.

[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.760]
No, but I'm saying foul was in charge of it.

[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.020]
Dennis Collins was the GM and they put it on the ear.

[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:04.880]
And they got ones.

[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.520]
They never, they never in that station at that time had the big,

[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.880]
and it still does, seven, 10, which is not radio my big.

[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.880]
The biggest, strongest daytime AM signal of any station

[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.800]
in the market, you can hear them in tapin' the daytime.

[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.080]
And they had a one.

[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.600]
It's criminal.

[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.440]
When you think about, they did not make one good hire over there

[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.140]
and all the time they had the stations.

[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.940]
They think about, they inherited Al.

[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.920]
Al came along with the license in the building and everything else.

[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:32.920]
And Wichner.

[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.640]
You know, they brought, yeah, well, yeah.

[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.180]
All right, yeah.

[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.360]
And then they brought in a succession of people,

[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:43.000]
like you say, David Gold and the guy who went up to Buffalo

[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.620]
with Mike Antony.

[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.120]
He was the program.

[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.620]
He was like the producer, but he did a show too.

[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.220]
The kid who got arrested in prostitution thing

[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:52.860]
up in Palm Beach.

[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.200]
Oh, Doug Young.

[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:54.920]
Doug Young, yeah.

[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.320]
And him and...

[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.120]
They just, one person after another,

[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.380]
they got rid of somebody and they brought in somebody

[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:01.980]
even worse.

[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:02.980]
They didn't make...

[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.360]
You would think just the lower averages

[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:04.900]
that they get.

[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.940]
What a high-end job for the first day.

[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.920]
Just moving around, changing the hour.

[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.140]
And time slots, Al in the afternoon, Al in midday, Al in the morning,

[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.000]
Debbie in the afternoon, Debbie in midday,

[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.740]
Sandy in the midday, Sandy in the afternoon.

[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.860]
Not only did they bring any new people in,

[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.320]
but they also just kept trying to pedal the same crap

[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.660]
with the same old callers and the same old guests.

[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.200]
And, you know, and then they just can't,

[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:24.840]
they don't understand.

[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.700]
And they didn't have the nerve.

[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.280]
They killed.

[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.960]
They killed topical talk.

[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.780]
They didn't want to do anything really wild.

[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.960]
And on the other hand, they didn't want to do anything

[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.900]
entertaining or different.

[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.860]
So they're stuck with that one geriatric oriented thing.

[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.440]
Yeah, they died.

[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.320]
Is that a big surprise?

[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.900]
No, if you're going to do talk,

[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.600]
you've got to be willing to take some heat.

[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.420]
I mean, this place took a lot of heat

[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.600]
when you were doing, you know, things.

[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.720]
And they bore the heat and it's worked out well.

[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.040]
You know, you got a big book.

[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.520]
They were afraid.

[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.320]
All it took was one letter and they were just

[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.400]
crapping their pants.

[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.020]
It was that simple and there would be a note.

[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.300]
We won't talk about this anymore.

[00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:58.920]
Kind of like what happened to me on the other show.

[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.260]
We will not talk about other spaces.

[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.760]
We will not talk about other personalities.

[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:02.500]
We will not.

[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.400]
Well, when you start, you know, with all the will nights

[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.600]
that you want to this, you want to this.

[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.360]
What's left?

[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.080]
You know, the old, the old reliable three,

[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.580]
abortion, birth control, and bio-imbo.

[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:11.800]
What they got on there now,

[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.820]
this is a great deal of memories, radio death.

[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.180]
I can't believe it.

[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.460]
I am so obsessed with it.

[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.360]
I got to be honest with you.

[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.220]
Every morning coming to work, I listen to Mike.

[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.400]
But now I'm punching over there.

[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.960]
And not because I'm enjoying it in shock,

[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.560]
just to see if this is really the format.

[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.940]
I mean, the yesterday I'm coming to work

[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.780]
if I play in the Wood Chopper's Ball by Woody Brown.

[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:30.940]
And I tell you, I heard them.

[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.540]
I mean, stuff that's been out since high-button shoes

[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.040]
40 years ago, 50 years ago.

[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.240]
All they got for spots, the public service announcements.

[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.940]
I tuned in yesterday, because you were talking about it.

[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.060]
So I flipped up when you're commercial.

[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.440]
And he is Audrey Meadows doing a spot for the American Society

[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.760]
and behind it, they're playing this guy's in love with you.

[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.620]
Right at right behind the spot,

[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.940]
like it was two radio stations.

[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.120]
And we talk about the things we say off the O.

[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.860]
And during the last break, I said to you,

[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.260]
they can't be serious with this format.

[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.500]
I mean, I can't believe that they...

[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.780]
So that is a bleminal message, you think?

[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.860]
Maybe they're into a little beach reality or something.

[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.460]
I don't know, but they can't be...

[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.240]
Who's gonna listen to it?

[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.540]
They'd be stealing their own audience from a life.

[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.220]
Like you said, yes, these are the people

[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.260]
that are too old for life.

[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.500]
And how can he still be there?

[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.500]
How can that end again?

[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.260]
People think it's personal on my part, they're right.

[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.720]
Because to me, it's one of the most objectionable people

[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.360]
I've ever encountered in this business.

[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.320]
And almost everybody has ever worked there.

[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.880]
We'll tell you exactly the same thing.

[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.720]
I don't know if he's still doing it.

[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.860]
If he does, that's fine with me.

[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.880]
Had people taping the show for a long time, every day,

[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.760]
waiting for me to say something

[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.580]
that he could take legal action on, okay?

[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.020]
But that's the kind of paranoia that exists.

[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.300]
My personal feeling, and it's just personal feeling,

[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.300]
was when the witch hunts were going on,

[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.720]
he had a big role in it.

[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.540]
Like my feeling.

[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:46.280]
Oh, I believe that.

[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.960]
And I have plenty of evidence and reason to stand there.

[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.440]
Yeah, right.

[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.800]
I have no proof, no evidence.

[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.100]
But, you know, if you put a gun to my head and said,

[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.360]
yes, and no, I would say yes.

[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.700]
And for someone who's running a radio station.

[00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.780]
And that bothers me, if you did.

[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.720]
In other words, the message that comes from that

[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.220]
is if you can't compete, destroy the opposition.

[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.300]
What kind of crap is that?

[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.080]
In other words, if you want to do the same format

[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.640]
or something close to it, compete, put some good people

[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.740]
on the air, do something exciting, do something different.

[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.760]
Don't try to run everybody else out of town.

[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.680]
And they couldn't compete at any point.

[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.280]
Well, and it's like, you know,

[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.700]
it's like letting the fox loose in the neighbor's chicken

[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.420]
coop and not having a fence on yours.

[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.300]
I mean, when you're doing a talk program,

[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.020]
talk radio yourself to encourage anybody

[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.320]
to try and stifle talk, it's crazy.

[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.880]
Because it's just going to be a matter of time, as it turned out.

[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.040]
And I don't know.

[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:39.600]
I do know.

[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.380]
They would never, you know, I did the story with Dennis.

[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.560]
And he says, I'm a talk guy.

[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.480]
I'm committed to talk.

[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.460]
But where was the evidence of that?

[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:47.840]
He never gave his people.

[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.260]
I understand how I had a piece of Saturday.

[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.400]
I was out of town where he said that he never got the support.

[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.380]
And that was certainly my perception.

[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.280]
And from the conversations I'd had with the people on that station,

[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.500]
that they got no support from the station.

[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.380]
When they got a crankle at it, instead of the GM coming in

[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.460]
and going, don't worry about it.

[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.140]
Do you show it?

[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.080]
We can't have this.

[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.220]
We can't have this.

[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:07.980]
And how can you do a show then?

[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.740]
When you got to sit here and worry about every word you're saying.

[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.420]
In addition to which they did the thing of KT had done back in the

[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.720]
RGSKT had no choice to have much of a signal.

[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.640]
But basically what they were saying, well, what's wrong with

[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.220]
the peeling the people over the age of 100?

[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.000]
What's wrong with that?

[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.120]
Let's put on all the felting spots and all the spots for

[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.640]
fire and I can't exactly.

[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.480]
And suddenly they discovered that nobody wanted to buy that

[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.740]
audience what little they had and they're watching.

[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.160]
They're going to fire sell rates.

[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.080]
You can't support a station like that.

[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.020]
And you know, another Saturdays,

[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.780]
when as Reagan faded and you know, Reaganism faded

[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:45.260]
and the country kind of the pandemics kind of swinging back the

[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:45.960]
other way now.

[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:46.640]
What do they do?

[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.180]
They put eight hours of right wing lunacy on on Saturday,

[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.000]
right at the time when the country's going the other way.

[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.280]
They put it on and they got Thompson and the other guy from LA.

[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.620]
You know, Mike Thompson and...

[00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:58.600]
Worse being born.

[00:25:58.660 --> 00:25:59.100]
Yeah, right.

[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.380]
I mean, they put eight hours of right wing mania on there

[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.060]
when the country's going the other way.

[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.640]
It was just like, it's like they had a death wish.

[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.180]
They just wanted to commit suicide.

[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.280]
If they brought the ratings down far enough,

[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.580]
there would be no choice and they could throw up their hands

[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.760]
and go, we tried.

[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.140]
What do we do?

[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.660]
They just don't know any better.

[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.420]
That's all they know.

[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.840]
Yeah, that certainly, you know, the evidence suggests that.

[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.680]
But I'm not going to believe the celebrity caller

[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.740]
that's on the bat line now looking for publicity.

[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.400]
Mr. Chica, Mr. Rogers, how are you doing?

[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.220]
How are you doing, Steve?

[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.120]
We're going to start charging you by the minute for this.

[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.500]
What are your charges, Bob, on this?

[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.260]
I was thinking you're taking hands on your show.

[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.700]
You have a large audience, you know?

[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.300]
Yeah, for you, we got a special race.

[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.100]
Listen, I got to tell you, we got to get all this in

[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.260]
before next Monday when I go on course management at FTL

[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.980]
has told me they don't want me to be on your show

[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.300]
to promote an audience for you.

[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.600]
Well, they've done a good job up there, too, Steve.

[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.880]
I really wish a lot of luck.

[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:53.500]
That's a joke.

[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.300]
You talk about walking into a haunted mess.

[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.600]
I mean, if I were you, I'd spray the microphone

[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.960]
when I get in in the morning because we are in the afternoon.

[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.220]
I don't think the guy in front of you is a big fan of yours.

[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.560]
Oh, listen, they just have to get to know me a little bit.

[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.280]
They all love me.

[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:08.780]
Who is that?

[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:09.560]
Who's the guy?

[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.320]
I have a piece tomorrow in the paper on your Steve

[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.280]
and you might be interested in some of the things he has to say.

[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.820]
I'm sure they're all glowing.

[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:17.340]
Yeah.

[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:18.580]
In one way or another.

[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.300]
Listen, one of the words.

[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.400]
The reason I called it was listening to you talking about

[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.780]
Dennis Collins and how they didn't give any support over there.

[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.360]
The great story, I just wanted to bring it back to mind,

[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.420]
was in the height of the AIDS epidemic.

[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.560]
When I, you know, wanted to do something innovative,

[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.060]
like bring a person with AIDS in the studio.

[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.480]
Well, that's when following that.

[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.800]
You know, well, the sour and, you know, Mr. Thompson,

[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.680]
Mike Thompson was afraid that the AIDS virus would get

[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.860]
in the air conditioner.

[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:46.620]
He told them.

[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.660]
And so, you know, that he might care something like that.

[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.740]
But anyway, you know, the thing went to Dennis.

[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.380]
And believe it or not, for the longest time,

[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.580]
Dennis refused to let me have anybody with AIDS in the studio.

[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.520]
And I said, Dennis, you know, you keep building this

[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.620]
with a public service station and we're here to help them.

[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.520]
We're community oriented.

[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.560]
I said, what kind of a message is this?

[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.940]
We're sending out in the height of this panic.

[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.000]
And it was only after the story was getting ready to go

[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.320]
on 60 minutes that he finally relented.

[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.980]
But not what you'd call a great, great...

[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.180]
Well, you got with them all over the edge.

[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.920]
Have you ever get any support on any issues?

[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.600]
The interesting thing is, I got with the, see,

[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.380]
that the AIDS thing was the beginning of my,

[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.540]
the deterioration of my relationship with Dennis.

[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.320]
I used to get along with him pretty well.

[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.580]
I found him pleasant and I had really nothing bad to say about him.

[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.180]
In fact, we even parted on pretty good terms.

[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.060]
But the station took so much heat.

[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:44.140]
You know, I think what happened is Al leaked to the weekly news

[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.840]
that Dennis wasn't letting a person with AIDS in the building.

[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.840]
Although, Dennis has told me, he says,

[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.280]
I know there's no chance anybody can get it.

[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.460]
But I have to be concerned with the feeling

[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.960]
of my other employees, which didn't hold a lot of water from him.

[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.900]
Which, and there was also one of them too, by the way.

[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.100]
They didn't want to come in the studio.

[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.760]
Yeah, that's a surprise me.

[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:04.640]
It was a crazy...

[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.660]
He put a shot to James.

[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.660]
There was for right with his 45.

[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.820]
Anyway, I don't want to hog anymore here, Tom.

[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:11.820]
Thanks for letting me on.

[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.460]
Don't forget, next Monday, Tom,

[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.220]
Jacob, I guess, an FBL 1400 of a dog.

[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.920]
Jesus, who can handle it, Steve?

[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.240]
All right, Gary. Thanks a lot.

[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:19.620]
Okay.

[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.300]
Now, what other station in America would allow that?

[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.320]
I can't think of one.

[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.520]
Dennis won't probably won't either.

[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:25.420]
It's been nice working here.

[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.180]
Anyway, it's 11 to 11.

[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.100]
I knew it was going to be.

[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.240]
I think it's the Oracle right at this moment.

[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.320]
Nah, relax.

[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.800]
Everybody's under control.

[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:32.360]
Right, Rick?

[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.000]
Huh?

[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.060]
Where's that card?

[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.960]
Okay, let's tell you about Toyota Hollywood right now.

[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:38.920]
Great news for Toyota.

[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:39.380]
T.

[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:39.560]
T.

[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:39.720]
T.

[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:39.840]
T.

[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:40.080]
T.

[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:40.080]

[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:40.440]
T.

[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:40.440]

[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:40.500]

[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.100]
T.

[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:41.100]

[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:41.740]
T.

[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:41.740]

[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:41.740]

[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:41.740]

[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:41.740]

[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:41.780]
T.

[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:41.780]

[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:41.780]

[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:41.780]

[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.320]
T.

[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:43.500]
T.

[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:44.380]
T.

[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:46.660]
Walter futures?

[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:47.300]
Yeah.

[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:47.300]

[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:47.300]

[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:59.140]
He just really picked up two newAM curiosities from the

[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.040]
Inaudible Col wife and mark.

[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:00.320]
Well, my only big talent here is, like it was a drops in

[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:04.520]
an hypothesis, my biggestkte name in the NAVI had discovered

[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.400]
and informed me for me, you know, he wrote a letter that

[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:14.360]
would find the way I did, Liura, Ross and Justin.

[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.740]
what every player in the dolphins make and what every player in majorly different

[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:18.140]
ballman.

[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.940]
Different show business.

[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:24.920]
So anyway, the deal he worked out with them is he gets 50% of all the revenue he brings

[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:29.420]
in and he says that he's already got $300,000 for the first year signed up, signed

[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:30.120]
sealed and delivered.

[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:30.480]
Yeah.

[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.880]
So if he does, he's going to be making a real handsome salary.

[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.840]
Well, he must be going to run a lot of spots because if people are going to pay the kind

[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.960]
of rate that that would translate to, I just don't understand it.

[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:39.780]
What?

[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:40.600]
A minute.

[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:43.640]
What a dollar a minute?

[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.020]
No.

[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:44.940]
How much?

[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.860]
100 $100 a minute on FTL.

[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.580]
Boy, we ought to hire him here as a salesman.

[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:56.920]
If he can get a hundred bucks for a spot on FTL, he has to be the greatest salesman in the

[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.300]
history.

[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.260]
Not just the radio.

[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.760]
He says that he's incredible.

[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:01.980]
I mean, I have this on.

[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:07.000]
Anybody in this community there would say, and it's not a knock on Steve, but let's face

[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.320]
it.

[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.160]
Well, I'll give you his explanation.

[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:08.780]
No, wait a minute.

[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.580]
Let me just say that.

[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.280]
Let's face it.

[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.740]
Well, that station is a zero.

[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.000]
And they got about a one now with their big bands.

[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.380]
But you know the damn well of people who are listening to the big bands are not going to

[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.000]
be the ones listening to Steve, okay?

[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:20.980]
No, I'd say that.

[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:24.160]
He has to build his entire audience from around zero.

[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:28.280]
Now if he's got that many people that are willing to spend that kind of money on a station

[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:33.100]
with limited signal and starting from zero, all I can say is, well, I'll tell you.

[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.400]
Again, this is not absolutely incredible.

[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.780]
This is all in the column tomorrow.

[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:41.160]
But Steve's argument is that most of his, a lot of his sponsors, certainly the ones

[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.060]
that he's taken with him, most of them are Broward restaurants.

[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:48.340]
And he said, when they were buying him here for approximately double that, it was spending

[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:51.820]
a lot of their money on people who are unlikely to be the customers.

[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.140]
I mean, if you live in Kendall like I do, you're not likely to.

[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.180]
But how many people live with them three miles of the tower?

[00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:56.700]
No, no.

[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.720]
If you're in Broward, you can get FTO anywhere in Broward.

[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.260]
It's got a good signal in Broward.

[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:01.580]
It does.

[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.900]
And so his argument is that they're getting Steve came for half price.

[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.020]
They're reaching us.

[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:06.840]
It's like a double TV.

[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.580]
You realize now that it's going to be.

[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.300]
Now, even though it's up into Bocca, you can get it like between five and six PM.

[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.140]
It's going to get in Bocca in the winter time like in November, December, June,

[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:15.620]
and February.

[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:16.220]
But I'm ready.

[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.780]
What about the point is you have to cut your power down when you're like we do.

[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.500]
You have to change pattern at sundown.

[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.480]
And as you get into these months of the year, I'm not trying to create a bad situation

[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.000]
for Steve.

[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.400]
I'm just laying it out like it is.

[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:31.120]
After five or five, fifteen, which will probably be in November, December, you can't hear

[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.560]
it like anywhere except for Lauderdale parts of plantation.

[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.400]
I mean, it's really a marginal situation.

[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.240]
Again, if you know that, then you know more than I do.

[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.660]
But again, that's one of the years.

[00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:44.500]
This is how Steve is selling the program that they're getting Steve came.

[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.360]
And that basis, it makes sense.

[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.280]
You know, you're getting them for half.

[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.660]
Well, okay, let's turn it around.

[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.000]
I will look at it from this standpoint.

[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.920]
Whatever he does on there is going to be so far in a way, the biggest thing that's ever

[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.520]
happened on that stage that he's certainly going to do well.

[00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:00.360]
If he can sustain the record, that's a program.

[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.740]
He says he's bringing in more money the first week than they started in the year.

[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:04.900]
I believe it.

[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.700]
I believe it because the station is a zero.

[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:10.360]
I know that they've had real financial nightmares in that place.

[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.400]
I mean, it's been talking.

[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:17.660]
I mean, I have quotes in the column tomorrow with the owner and Mike Roberts, you know, almost

[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.760]
say in terms of, hey, it was this turn off the transmitter.

[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.560]
I mean, they didn't quite say that.

[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.160]
But they say, hey, we had to do something.

[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.380]
We had to keep the station vibrant and alive.

[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.920]
Steve is bringing in a lot of money.

[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.080]
And they're not on half.

[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.920]
But isn't it interesting, though, you say that Stern is going to be on an LA?

[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:39.900]
Isn't it amazing that people who do things that are different and radical and exciting

[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.420]
and fun and interesting?

[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.700]
Those people succeed.

[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:47.320]
People who want to keep doing the same boring crap and try to shove it down to public

[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.000]
throat and force.

[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:48.400]
Feed them.

[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:49.000]
Fail.

[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:54.060]
WLS in Chicago, all the CAHPS city stations, W-A-B-C, New York, they're trying to do that

[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:57.680]
same old boring stuff to public spread out on it.

[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.520]
They don't give a damn.

[00:33:58.580 --> 00:33:59.320]
They don't care.

[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.340]
People are looking for excitement in their lives.

[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.580]
Most people have very mundane lives and they're looking for excitement.

[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.680]
It's the same thing on television.

[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.400]
You do something, well, I shouldn't say that.

[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.700]
This is the things that are doing different.

[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:16.640]
But even for a while, the moron, which one?

[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.820]
The guy with the screamer by my brain.

[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.160]
I'm on some, yeah, right.

[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.500]
I'm on so much medication for this.

[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:21.920]
Call them.

[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.020]
Anyway, Mortar, he can't even for a year at work because he was different.

[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.640]
He was, there was some life in the show.

[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.780]
It was a horrendous show.

[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.340]
I agree, but it was different.

[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:34.320]
You didn't know if the guy was going to self destruct on the air.

[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:39.000]
I got back to Australia, I said often when, when Evil Caniva was jumping over the snake

[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.940]
river and he said, you know, well, who do you think is going to come to see this?

[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.420]
And he said, well, I'll tell you who's going to come.

[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:46.600]
He says 10% of the people that come are going to want to see me make it.

[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.660]
He says 10% are going to want to see me fail.

[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.060]
And the other 80% of there, just in case they fail, they want to see me die.

[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:52.420]
Go ahead.

[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:53.520]
And that's it, people.

[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.420]
If a guy, the Howard Beale thing, you know, he takes the guy.

[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.860]
You're tuned in just to see what he would do.

[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.260]
I mean, I think that's part of the appeal now of Dan Rather.

[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:04.300]
You know, tune in tonight.

[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.240]
This might be the night that Dan loses it.

[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000]
You just don't know.

[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.340]
And people will tune in.

[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:13.500]
I hate to even say it, but the thought occurred to me when I was trying to just gather my

[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.860]
thoughts and think about the breeders cup that because of what happened this Saturday,

[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.980]
the audience might go up next year just because there are people that tune in at a

[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.340]
ghoul in their curiosity.

[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:26.600]
And I don't, I almost like the season, you know, say, we don't want you.

[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:26.940]
Get away.

[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:30.600]
You know, we don't, if that's why you tuned in, don't, you know, and I'm not being like

[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.620]
the other, do you order races love to say, well, people don't come to see the accents?

[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:34.080]
You have right.

[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:34.520]
Sure.

[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:34.760]
Yeah.

[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:38.660]
If the Indianapolis 500, David devised a way that there would be no accident, you know,

[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.520]
you couldn't get it on WFTL.

[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.240]
Never mind network television.

[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:43.340]
Okay.

[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.420]
We're at the end of the first hour.

[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:46.700]
We had a momentous first hour here.

[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:47.920]
We got a lot more to talk about.

[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.700]
And Tom jickers with us, food from pizza loft to becoming any minute right.

[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.360]
We're getting some good chow for Tom here.

[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.180]
Have a report.

[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.060]
I've never reported.

[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.960]
He's got another call that off the air will be discussing and seeing what's going on.

[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.220]
Could be private in which case I want to ask you too many questions.

[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.380]
Anyway, we got Henry Barrow standing by.

[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.660]
Of course, Henry kind of takes this all in stride.

[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.540]
He's seen it come and go 26 years.

[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:09.360]
He's still waiting for that hurricane.

[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.480]
He's been leading newscast.

[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:11.600]
26 years.

[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.480]
The man has been here and they still won't let him back in the stadium.

[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.360]
It's just incredible.

[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.280]
They have his picture like at the racetrack, right?

[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:17.940]
Undesirable.

[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:18.580]
Exactly.

[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:19.040]

[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:20.880]
With bars across.

[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.860]
Well, the all the band is them and told if you spiked this guy tournament.

[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:24.400]
It's a picture.

[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.000]
In fact, Henry right on the back of Mr. Weaver's chair up there.

[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.060]
If you've seen this man, it says anyway, Henry's got our 11 o'clock W.I.O.D.

[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.180]
News will come back with Tom jica at 11.05.

[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:34.540]
Two of Tom's favorites.

[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.820]

[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:30.480]
Should I?

[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.640]

Cut it out Halsian.

[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:49.300]
She's a wonderful little lady but that's not screw up the show yet.

[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:50.740]
Maybe it's sabotage.

[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.380]
Maybe it was sending people over here.

[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.200]
Or somebody from the afternoon show.

[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:55.200]
Well could be.

[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.520]
Well we'll find out I guess.

[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.300]

[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:00.520]
Come on.

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.500]
Okay.

[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.140]
Well just checking we want to be real professional because we have a lot of people in the business

[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:05.420]
list.

[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.640]
I think we have everyone in the business from the calls would be.

[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:07.960]
Yeah.

[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:08.840]
Unbelievable.

[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.700]
Well so we left some stuff out.

[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:15.900]
Is there anything else we want to say about the WNWS may have rest in peace about how

[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.220]
they drove it into the ground and about cheese?

[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:23.060]
And of course I went there the day was on the air and I was there in Charlie campus and

[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:27.020]
Stan Major and Mickey Dane and I thought there was another one.

[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.480]
She called in the other day.

[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:28.740]
Yeah.

[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.640]
See last Thursday and Friday we didn't know it was coming.

[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.540]
Well she's still trying to figure out who's with the B.

[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:35.920]
Oh.

[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.100]
Like Barbara Studdly perhaps that could be it.

[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.300]
But anyway and I did this thing I still have them by the way.

[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.120]
I'm never going to throw this away and we kept adding to the list of all the names.

[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:47.520]
God the bad man.

[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.200]
Who'd worked there.

[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:49.940]
What do you mean?

[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.960]
That many I got pages and pages and when we did our little when you think that they

[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.700]
think over there I read them all off.

[00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:00.300]
If we had some appropriate music and I read all of these names Arlene Wolfe.

[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.580]
Bob is here to do a parrata.

[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:04.780]
Oh God what a list this is John levit.

[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:05.560]
Wow.

[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.180]
Wow Stacey Lieberman.

[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.580]
Man Nancy McCartney.

[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.260]
Oh I'll tell you a story about John levit.

[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.600]
I go up the you know I stayed in my mother's in Jersey.

[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:15.140]
Uh huh.

[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.020]
Who moves in next door to her last week?

[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:22.180]
A guy named Al Gordon who used to do traffic or something he said on your show and he's

[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:26.580]
like I he knocks on the door and he says your Tom joker says yes you know when your

[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:30.420]
mother moved in I saw the name I knew it had to be you know or somehow relative and

[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:34.360]
he came in except for about an hour tell you going over all and one of the names he mentioned

[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:38.280]
was John levit and you know and I was telling him because I just got north of the phone

[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:42.280]
with all the nonsense going on down here and he says well I was hoping to come back down

[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:42.800]
to the market.

[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:47.220]
He's doing some kind of a Jewish ethnic show on Sunday at some obscure station.

[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.060]
Yeah and he had John levit.

[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:49.640]
He said wow.

[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.380]
I work with John levit when he was there on the board and everything.

[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.820]
Boy that's the big time.

[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:58.080]
I want to tell you one of the great stories in history as long as we're doing the snails

[00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:58.540]
in the coffin.

[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.820]
Also yesterday another name came back to me.

[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.920]
There was a young kid of salesman Milton somebody a glasses.

[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.380]
He was like from you of Emmer something and I left him off the list.

[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:10.400]
Somebody will call in maybe Alimax.

[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.060]
Well you even did the behind the bat line.

[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.380]
Maybe Alimax would Milton's last name was because I'm trying to complete this list.

[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:15.980]
Oh yeah.

[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:20.420]
Everybody office people Jean Miller the old guy in continuity who was just a funny great

[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.920]
guy and Contita Ruiz one of the news people.

[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:26.120]
I just named the shafa Tom Shafers.

[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:26.560]
Of course.

[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:31.380]
But anyways speaking of John levit this may take too long but it's a great story.

[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.360]
Chris well John levit was my producer.

[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:39.940]
Bored up and John was just basically all this kind of from the Rick Riley school personality

[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.420]
offended a lot of people in the building.

[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:49.060]
A lot of people crazy and when hurricane David came and went was either hurricane David

[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:51.280]
or was not maybe a milder one a lesser one.

[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.620]
But at any rate he was a meteorologist evidently.

[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:54.980]
Oh yeah.

[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.000]
Oh yeah.

[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.000]
And was driving the news department crazy.

[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:03.680]
I mean just running them around like he had some kind of a title or something and I don't

[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.320]
think I was there.

[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.240]
I think I was on vacation or something at the time.

[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.880]
So wasn't hurricane David was another one.

[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.680]
And to make a long story short the staff was ready to lynch him.

[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.840]
I mean just just go and crazy and writing.

[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.960]
They didn't come to the whole news department put together a letter to him like so anyway

[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.520]
he resigned in very dramatic fashion.

[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:24.440]
Oh with the expectation that we would come running to get him back.

[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:28.420]
Well at that point I hired Chris Loner then became my producer.

[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:33.400]
Proud of remember Chris and Chris did a fine job and one night I'm on the year doing

[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:33.860]
my show.

[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:37.480]
Oh Chris is sitting in there and control room running the board answering the phones.

[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:42.820]
And John comes in with his friend Dennis who was another former board off there.

[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.260]
Dennis was the blood off of my show.

[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:44.920]
Right.

[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.260]
They come in and he sits down.

[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.260]
Remember there were like a couple of chair decks to where the board upset in the control

[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:50.480]
room.

[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.720]
It sits down waves and I wave back and I'm just doing my show and I'm talking to the

[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.340]
callers.

[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:02.140]
And we go into a break and this is the last spot we didn't have rejoined jingles.

[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.480]
His last spot would end over there.

[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.200]
The board up would give you the cue to come back your back on.

[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.380]
And now I'm watching I'm getting arms in stereo.

[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.900]
Chris Loner is pointing back and now John Levitt sitting next to me it's like wow it's

[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.280]
like old times like he's just going to move right back in and chair.

[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.660]
He's also cueing me.

[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:18.580]
I'm getting two arms.

[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.280]
I have never seen anything he sat there for like the entire show.

[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.220]
Cueing me to come back on assuming that well he was just now he was ready to come back

[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:28.640]
and we welcome him back with open arm.

[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.580]
It was just which needless to say we did not.

[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.340]
Did you talk about the time?

[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.860]
Chrome got stuck and that crime Jerry gets stuck up.

[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.220]
I was very waiting.

[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:36.680]
Yeah.

[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:37.120]
Oh yeah.

[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.460]
That was another great WNWS while I was on the year.

[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:39.860]
Yeah.

[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:44.440]
And it's the stuff coming out when I was there the 10 12 weeks that I was there was when

[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.500]
everyone was getting sick with the.

[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:45.800]
Oh yeah.

[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.260]
We also had the disease in the air conditioning events.

[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:51.360]
I forgot about that and there was something in the events and all of us were getting this

[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:55.380]
awful illness and we couldn't I did two hours into Sunday night and I couldn't talk

[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:56.300]
till Tuesday every way.

[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:56.460]
Yeah.

[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.160]
And the motto over there was there's a fungus among us.

[00:43:59.160 --> 00:43:59.380]
Yeah.

[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.740]
And go out with that.

[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:01.500]
Nothing and nothing.

[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:01.760]
Nothing.

[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.560]
Little did we realize that after some of us left the fungus would grow much more intensely

[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.520]
of course they were in the same building I don't think.

[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:09.500]
When did they go?

[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:09.800]
No.

[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.760]
It was quite a while after it was wasn't it?

[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:13.140]
Did we get Milton's last name?

[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.580]
Did anybody what was it?

[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:15.100]

[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.920]
Milton Fisher outstanding.

[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.640]
Hey wait a minute let me write that on my list.

[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:19.180]
All right.

[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:20.820]
Are we doing it?

[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.240]
See this doesn't have any security.

[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.700]
Oh man.

[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:25.980]
Just unbelievable.

[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.040]
Camille San Son, Ellen Morphonius, Cabe Aroni.

[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:30.500]
I might just read them all off again.

[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:34.180]
Paper on that's right that was another that was another thing where I got in the

[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:34.980]
Albright and Graham.

[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:37.820]
I think I got involved in it's feud with Conlon.

[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.740]
Was it Conlon's a follower over that one where the way they fired her?

[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:42.300]
Oh yeah.

[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.080]
It's all over there with that.

[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:46.100]
They were going to make a serious director and they let us serve as acting news director

[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:49.480]
for eight months and then when the stations combined they're like every Sullivan was

[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.680]
put in the driving the news van here at the library.

[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.280]
Because there were a few people gotten screwed here at two folks we don't want to go into

[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.620]
that because we don't have 30 hours.

[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.020]
I talked to Jerry for about an hour about two weeks ago.

[00:44:59.200 --> 00:44:59.320]
Yeah.

[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.100]
About the whole city.

[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.400]
He said he'd love to come back here.

[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:05.480]
I don't want to make boy Gary nervous or anything but he said that boy Gary will be

[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.080]
good and Detroit.

[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:09.800]
Anyway, this Friday night the biggest sports event in South Florida of the season.

[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.240]
It's the breeder's crown.

[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:15.520]
Unbelievable to certify vacations breeder's crown with eight division championships more

[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.400]
than two and a quarter million dollars in purses all in one night.

[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.980]
Sixty eight of the most talented pastures and trotters in racing were compete for the

[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:24.400]
crowns in the three year old and age divisions.

[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:28.140]
Friday night could become the greatest night in the history of harness racing as beach

[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:31.940]
towel attempts to become the first standard bread ever to win more than two million dollars

[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:32.660]
in one season.

[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.580]
Tom Pearl be racing to become the first Philly pace to win breeder's crown championships

[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:41.820]
as both a two and three year old in the great peace core returns to popular hardest looking

[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.260]
for a third consecutive breeder's crown championship.

[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:48.100]
You still have time to get your tickets for the certified vacation breeder's crown reserve

[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:49.740]
grandstand and box seats available.

[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:54.000]
The breeder's crown ticket office opened daily 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. so get out to Pompato

[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.500]
Park today for the best seat selection.

[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:59.800]
It's right off the Atlantic Boulevard exit of I 95 and just before minutes off the Pompato

[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.080]
ways of the term pike.

[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:06.040]
The names again incredible not just the horses all the top drivers in the sport will have

[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:11.340]
a Michael a chance in Ron Waples and John Campbell and Bill O'Donnell and Jack Moisef and

[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.880]
you have a Corp.

[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:13.360]
Who is it?

[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.220]
You Bell.

[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:15.000]
Yeah, you Bell.

[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:15.240]
Here you go.

[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.760]
We're going to bring him back.

[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:18.820]
Oh geez.

[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:17.920]
You had to throw that one in there.

[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.820]
I don't think the red man's going to be there, but we'll survive without him.

[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:21.520]
It's going to be great.

[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.000]
It's going to be the night of the lifetime in hardest racing.

[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.160]
So make your plans now.

[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:29.560]
Don't forget early post time and early opening for the gates gates will open Friday at

[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.200]
five post time for the first race.

[00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:31.640]
Seven.

[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.420]
So come out early and have a great time at Pompato, hardest this Friday night for breeder's

[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.040]
crown night.

[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.560]
1117 at W.I.O.D.

[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:43.800]
We had a great time.

[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.480]
We'd be remiss.

[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.780]
There must be something going on in TV because you're calling them in the paper this morning.

[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.900]
What's all about TV?

[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:55.320]
The sweeps, what I was saying was it's probably the tamest November sweeps that I certainly

[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:55.620]
I can.

[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:59.000]
There's only two two two two pot mini series the entire month in November.

[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.840]
I mean, this is when you used to have the Alonsoont Dubs and the Warren remembrances and

[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.080]
you know, the really great multi pot things.

[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:08.960]
The networks just aren't spending the money anymore because they don't have it.

[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:13.780]
The biggest events, which is the lead on the piece that I did is a regular series episode.

[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.280]
The 200th episode of Cheers.

[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:20.460]
There's a couple of Larry King is going to be on Murphy Brown if you can believe it.

[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:20.860]
Why why?

[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.240]
I mean, he's everywhere else.

[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:26.240]
Do you want to spend an hour or two critiquing a show which I didn't want to play?

[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:27.540]
I was on the plane.

[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:27.920]
Oh, you didn't.

[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:28.720]
You missed it?

[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:29.020]
No.

[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:29.820]
What a bad break.

[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:30.340]
Yeah.

[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.560]
Well, I missed all the excitement last weekend.

[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.060]
But as you said, I'm like, what is it?

[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:35.540]
What is it?

[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:37.020]
I thought I'd put it that I would.

[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:37.020]

[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:37.980]
Larry King?

[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:38.240]
Yeah.

[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.320]
He wants everything.

[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.720]
I mean, basically that thing.

[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.440]
I mean, the guy's making more money than God.

[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:48.720]
He's got more luck than probably anybody, all of any thousand people you know put together.

[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.780]
He's certainly taking a little bit of talent a long way.

[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:52.080]
You got to get credit for that.

[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:52.180]
You got to get credit for that.

[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:52.660]
Yeah.

[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:55.980]
Got to be the greatest BS artist in the history of the human race.

[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:56.840]
Yeah, what does he do?

[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.060]
But what does he want?

[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:01.020]
I mean, how thin can you, the guy already had what?

[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:02.220]
One or two heart attacks.

[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:02.700]
Yeah.

[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:03.980]
How thin can you spread yourself?

[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.560]
How many different things have you got to do before your satisfy?

[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:10.220]
I guess they want to say, you know, you who says you can't have it all, certainly not

[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:10.540]
Larry.

[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.940]
I mean, the thing with the Ted Turner and those games up in Seattle are worth it.

[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.500]
That was the biggest bomb in history.

[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:16.140]
I can't.

[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.720]
I really, I don't know why they're bringing them back in four years.

[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:21.860]
I mean, those games were created when the Russians and the Americans weren't talking

[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:22.420]
each other.

[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:27.160]
You know, as I said in the column before they came on, goodwill was the worst thing that

[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.500]
ever happened to the goodwill games.

[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.900]
You know, we don't have an enemy anymore.

[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:35.340]
You know, maybe if, you know, Libya had a team in the games, people could get excited.

[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.580]
But here we are.

[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:37.140]
We're all loving it.

[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:40.660]
We're all loving everything, you know, all of a sudden, Russia's on our side and everything.

[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:45.080]
They must be going crazy down in a little amount of, you know, the worst thing you can do

[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.440]
to people is take their enemies away.

[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:48.640]
Be like a brick rally left the market.

[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:49.200]
What would I do?

[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:49.880]
Oh, geezer.

[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:53.220]
Do we want to spend, I mean, if you want to got more to say, I'll just be back here.

[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:54.160]
I'll not be here any minute.

[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:56.880]
I'll just let you go on because obviously you guys just hate each other.

[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.340]
Like Poison, I don't understand it.

[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:02.760]
Well, I didn't hate him like Poison until he did that four hours on me that afternoon

[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:06.240]
and did it in a, what I thought was a very unfair and unprofessional way.

[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:10.380]
Totally overlooking the purpose of the column, leaving out things that I put in there that

[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:13.220]
would have greatly changed the nature of what he said, I said.

[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:17.400]
See, what bothers me about this business, for example, you talk to Al during the news,

[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:18.880]
you know, private, which is fine.

[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:23.200]
What bothers me is that some people, this is the one problem I have with Al and I know

[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:23.760]
he's listening.

[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:30.220]
And this isn't a defense because I've taken some pretty nasty posts, but none of it meant

[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:30.880]
to be personal.

[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.820]
In other words, if there weren't certain things that he did on the air, a lot of the

[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.060]
stuff I've done, I never would have said.

[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:35.800]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:36.960]
I don't want to get into the specifics.

[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:42.740]
But the bottom line is you've got to be able to discern the difference between what somebody

[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:45.820]
is doing as part of their job and taking it so personally.

[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:48.320]
I know it's only that bothers me because I like Al.

[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:48.880]
I really do.

[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.560]
I mean, he's not a pro.

[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:51.040]
He's not a pro.

[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.540]
He's not a person you really would have a reason to dislike.

[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:54.700]
He's a good guy.

[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:55.640]
I like him.

[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.140]
But nonetheless, when I'm on the air, I'm doing a stick.

[00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:59.100]
I'm doing my thing.

[00:49:59.200 --> 00:49:59.480]
Okay.

[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.560]
And I'm here to win.

[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:04.740]
I'm not here to, you know, in the nature of this business, look at all the people sitting

[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:07.100]
on a sideline right now who should be on the air.

[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:11.460]
I know you could make a whole radio station out of just the people who are out of work

[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.180]
in talk in this market right now and have a damn good station.

[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:15.880]
I know show business.

[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:20.540]
And I know when that's happening into a certain, like if he came in, he wanted to take some

[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:21.620]
fun, just great.

[00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.560]
You know, that's what I thought was going to back and forth.

[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:24.740]
I thought it was going to be a boy.

[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:25.320]
But it wasn't.

[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.140]
It was very, very nasty and very, very personal.

[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:31.240]
And that's when my opinion of him changed.

[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.640]
I mean, even that day came in.

[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.260]
I was annoyed when I left, but I didn't hate the guy.

[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.240]
And, you know, well, I felt that was a little bit of show business.

[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:42.240]
He certainly provided a great lead in face show that afternoon.

[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:43.360]
Well, here I am.

[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.240]
You know, I think he's got to be careful to understand.

[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:46.680]
I'm not trying to lecture him all over.

[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:47.660]
I'll do my best.

[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:50.520]
One book doesn't make a lifetime.

[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:51.080]
Exactly.

[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.680]
Or one or two books in other states.

[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:54.700]
In other words, the ratings, you know what I think of them.

[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:55.420]
I think they're garbage.

[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:58.600]
Even though I had a great summer book and all of that, I think they're crap.

[00:50:58.780 --> 00:50:59.560]
I think they're erratic.

[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:00.620]
I think they're sampling.

[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:01.500]
It's just a nightmare.

[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:05.700]
But the bottom line is over a period of time like take-wary, for example, whether you like

[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:06.180]
them or not.

[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.380]
Over 15 years in a market, the man is a monster in the morning.

[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:10.740]
Okay.

[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:10.940]
Yeah.

[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.420]
He had his down periods too, but the bottom line is right up there.

[00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:16.320]
He's got a six eight in the morning, which in this, a six eight in the morning here

[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.240]
is unbelievable.

[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.680]
I mean, nobody can understand the list during the business.

[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.180]
What a big number that is.

[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:25.560]
And over, if you can sustain it over a long period of time, then you got something to

[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.620]
start blowing your horn about.

[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.340]
You and I had some arguments over the years about Ralph Renek.

[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.140]
And that's exactly what I was saying.

[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:35.360]
I was never a fan of Ralph Renek the way he does the news, the centaurian thing.

[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:39.800]
But I respected tremendously the fact that he was on top of his long period.

[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.300]
You can stay under here in this market 30 years doing anything, even picking your nose,

[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:44.120]
man, more power, too.

[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:48.860]
And that's how I always felt about Ralph Renek that give the guy credit in a business

[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:52.040]
where at 13 weeks is forever, he was on for 30 years.

[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.300]
And the same thing, Renek, in the morning, you've got to give the guy credit.

[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:59.180]
I mean, think of all the high price talent they've thrown in against him.

[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:03.940]
I mean, you know, they're the sunny foxes and the, you know, Tanner and Cox, you know,

[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:07.680]
they've all taken their shots at the guy and Rick and Suds is another one that, you

[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:11.720]
know, they were on opposite Renek, in the morning and Hermenemick being and all the others.

[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:13.440]
He's right there, book after book.

[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:15.940]
He might have one down book, but for me, he always found this right.

[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:19.280]
I'm thinking about the station now, if I can just, which I usually don't do, but that

[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.260]
I'm excited about.

[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:23.400]
He does his thing, which is totally different from anything that I do.

[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.260]
I do my act.

[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:27.900]
In the beginning, when they came here first, because they were just thrown into it, they

[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.760]
were playing my cards and doing a lot of my stuff.

[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:32.540]
They would, you know, because they filled in for me when I was sick back in the spring.

[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:33.300]
That's how I got the job.

[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.340]
But now they have developed their own thing.

[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.660]
They do a totally different thing from what I do.

[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:38.340]
And that's great.

[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.280]
We've got three completely unique shows.

[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:44.420]
The audience is happier than they have been in a long time, at least today, who knows

[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:44.940]
about tomorrow.

[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:45.920]
And that's great.

[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.140]
That's what it's all about.

[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:52.380]
Well, I give, you know, again, I listen to this show from time to time.

[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:57.020]
I mean, I'll be honest, when I'm when I'm in hearing range now, my first choice will

[00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:58.740]
be Steve, but he does a lot of things that I know.

[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:00.440]
I mean, I turn it if he's doing something.

[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:01.600]
I'd listen to that.

[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:06.040]
I'll also say this in spite of what I said before, I listen to these guys on a way home

[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:06.560]
every day.

[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:07.000]
Okay.

[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.960]
I listen to them when Steve was here.

[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:11.320]
I would listen for 10 or 15 minutes.

[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:15.880]
And more often than not, I would change it to something else or put on music, not because

[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.400]
they don't like Steve, but because of the repetitive guests.

[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:19.240]
I mean, cheese.

[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:23.540]
I mean, and if he learns a lesson fine, I know this is a tough market for guests.

[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:24.840]
This isn't New York or LA.

[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:27.280]
They're just aren't all that many great, exciting people available.

[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:32.120]
But after you've heard the same number 4,000 times, you just can't stick with it anymore.

[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:32.500]
Wow.

[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:37.340]
As I've said many times, I don't get to hear a lot of the whoever's in that hour because

[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:39.240]
that's generally the time.

[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:44.180]
I mean, the office, a lot of days I leave early, you know, 5, quarter to 5, and then I

[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:45.120]
get to hear an outer show.

[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.820]
I turn rickensides on even now with the dispute.

[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:48.760]
I listen to them.

[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:50.840]
And as your blood boy, you get a little bit of help.

[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:51.520]
I'm upset.

[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:52.480]
I'm upset.

[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:53.580]
You start like punching the video.

[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.880]
What they do though, I don't think if I was available to listen to the show for a lot

[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:03.900]
more, I don't think that I would listen to it over a period of time because putting

[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:07.000]
with creamy your pants is not something that I find amusing more than one.

[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:07.880]
Unless you're doing it.

[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:08.160]
Yeah.

[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.340]
Okay, let me do a little break.

[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:13.080]
It's 1125 at W.Y.O.D. here is a special message from Lojak.

[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:17.160]
All of you folks out there in your cars making the most of South Florida's beautiful beaches.

[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:20.420]
If you think your car is safe away from the city, think again.

[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:24.060]
Barbara M found out the hard way she went to the beach for the weekend at a brand new

[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:24.520]
Camaro.

[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.380]
As she drove up to her hotel, she turned the car over to the valley on duty, checked

[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:28.640]
him.

[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:31.660]
After freshening up, she went out to get her car and asked for the valley.

[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.780]
What valley asked the bell boy we don't have one?

[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:35.800]
Surprise, Barbara.

[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:38.620]
But luckily, the Camaro had Lojak installed.

[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:42.200]
And if the Lojak signal was activated by the pigs, the car was recovered with hardly

[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:42.900]
any damage.

[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.820]
The Fone Valley was busted to make a long story short.

[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:48.480]
It turned out to be a happy ending instead of a nightmare.

[00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:53.060]
So remember, just like you flocked to the beach to enjoy the sun, so do the car thieves

[00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:55.760]
to enjoy the parking lots full of cars ripe for the picking.

[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:59.180]
So now let's do some douchebag ruin your weekend or your life.

[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:03.180]
Protect that investment, which is often a big one, with Lojak protection.

[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.360]
It makes all the sense in the world.

[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:08.160]
For information, or to arrange convenient installation at your home, your office, or

[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.720]
a new car dealership called Elaine.

[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:13.060]
Right now, she'll be waiting for your call till 6 o'clock tonight.

[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.240]
1-800-LO-JACK.

[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:18.200]
That's 1-800-535-6522.

[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.620]
One of the most important calls you'll ever make.

[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:28.200]
If you missed the Rick and Sud show yesterday on 610-W-I-O-D, you missed the adventures

[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.660]
of Sir Lance Lyte.

[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:30.320]
What?

[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:31.160]
That's right.

[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:35.960]
We also went over some phone calls in regards to Friday's funeral.

[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.660]
It's wanted to comment on Friday's show.

[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:38.200]
Yeah.

[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:39.180]
Incredible.

[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.540]
The radio history is certainly was.

[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:45.680]
Radio history every afternoon at 2 with Rick and Sud here at WIOG.

[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:46.060]
Hello?

[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:46.560]
Hello?

[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:47.220]
Hi.

[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:48.060]
Bay-Bud?

[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:51.120]
I said booty-low.

[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:51.940]
booty-low.

[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.260]
I was like, booty-low.

[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:53.420]

[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:53.420]

[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:53.560]
Oh, man.

[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:56.400]
Uh, limping guys.

[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:57.380]
Hat-false-tool.

[00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.620]
It's a bowl for you.

[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:00.640]
It's an excellent show for you.

[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:04.560]
Don't miss today's Rick and Sud show it too.

[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:07.200]
I'm South Florida's news traffic in weather states.

[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:08.820]
News talk radio.

[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:10.760]
610-W-I-O-D.

[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.640]
That was the best for a while.

[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:12.340]
Exactly.

[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:13.260]
Yeah.

[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:14.540]

[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:14.900]

[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:15.040]
Yeah.

[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:15.500]
Yeah.

[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:15.600]
Yeah.

[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:15.600]

[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:15.860]

[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:16.420]
Yeah.

[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:16.440]

[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:16.480]

[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:16.480]

[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:17.060]

[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:17.740]
Yeah.

[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:19.740]
Yeah.

[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:21.200]
There is a lot of people on the phone just a couple of minutes.

[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:23.640]
We've been calling, and we've been blowing them off.

[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:24.460]
We're busy.

[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:29.380]
But I want to talk about the TV news, because I keep given my opinions because I got the

[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:30.400]
cable a couple of months ago.

[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:30.940]
Finally.

[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:31.460]
Not even.

[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.100]
Maybe a month.

[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:34.580]
Finally, they got it by me, in Plantation Acres.

[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:36.920]
And watching local news again.

[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:39.680]
And like I said, during the break I think Channel 6.

[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.360]
They don't get a lot of publicity for some reason.

[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:49.720]
But I think between Hamburg and Giselle Fernandes and Marberry's slow, and Ken and Marberry

[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:50.500]
and uh... mats

[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:54.960]
i think it's a much of an excellent before them are really good

[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.720]
yet again i could live without

[00:56:56.720 --> 00:57:00.320]
of the sports guys uh... the sports guys yeah

[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:03.260]
i hit what a terrible promotion that is the terrible

[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:06.360]
and there aren't you know a tony uh...

[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:07.440]
aside from some time being silly

[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:09.760]
tony and i do a fine job on four yeah

[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.780]
but they just have never been a good spot

[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:15.760]
this is one of the weakest down for sports tv personalities ever seen well i

[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.020]
started about sports and

[00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:18.440]
we'll go to the bruh and thought of it

[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:19.380]
saturday night

[00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:21.620]
and home the breeder's cup eleven o'clock comes

[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:23.520]
i had no idea how anybody had done

[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:26.640]
you know football that day because i just really wasn't paying attention we

[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.040]
went out to dinner after the breeder's cup

[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:30.540]
i put on the eleven o'clock news guys on his truth

[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.140]
on NBC in New York

[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:36.500]
they gave no college football scores only like columbia

[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:38.140]
and like stony brook

[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:39.480]
and marist and for them

[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:43.260]
and say they didn't tell you here they didn't even tell you how the top ten did

[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:44.280]
no scores

[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:45.760]
i saturday night

[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:49.380]
on the nbc on station in the largest market in the country

[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:50.740]
no college football

[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:54.420]
i can remember during baseball season watching uh... the news on p.i.e. x in

[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:57.700]
new york on the satellite at night and they'd give the anky and a med school would

[00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:00.160]
give no other major league baseball i think because they were shipping that

[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:03.380]
thing all over the country and they didn't want to know this is i'm no i'm

[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:07.720]
talking about their local news not the uh... the whatever they know now

[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:10.480]
well that they're definitely news that right

[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:11.480]
ten o'clock

[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:12.220]
whatever

[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:14.880]
you know set maybe they didn't want to give partial scores

[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:17.520]
but we're talking about i'm just speculating

[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:21.680]
but on it and network on station in new york city in the height of the football

[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:22.120]
season

[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.500]
no college football scores none

[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.340]
zilch and of course the only thing they show the breeder's cup was going

[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:28.340]
for one break and down

[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:32.580]
they know yeah and brito wins you know all of them they have to show it over and

[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:36.620]
over and over again that's never gonna stop yet you got to get a good

[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:40.260]
one of winds the breeder's cup classic and that that's all right now this

[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:43.820]
signal problem six seems to be mostly fixed at least continental cables got

[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:44.320]
excellent

[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:48.900]
cable effects if you've got an antenna still a problem are they making any

[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:51.880]
enrolled you they still well they're in good shape because in brown county about

[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:53.880]
seventy seventy five percent of the people have cable

[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:57.620]
but i mean terms of numbers six making any in real time oh yeah they're

[00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:59.160]
finishing ahead of four some nights

[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:02.700]
c-force problem they they brought some people in

[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:05.840]
cali craigs a little too cute be dollar

[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:09.340]
i think she's she does some good things but you know she just has that

[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:13.260]
because of it you hate to you hate to stigmatize somebody because of their

[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:14.960]
parents because they happen to be good looking people

[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:18.100]
but you almost got the feeling that's the sole reason she's there and that's

[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.420]
probably not being fair to her

[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.960]
but what they've got to do whether it's cali craig and tom reyland they've got

[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:28.880]
to leave people there there another one like in w-s every time you turn around

[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:29.620]
is a different and

[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:35.180]
news is like soap operas people get comfortable with the weather some nights

[00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:38.380]
brine or cross like they're like the way it does brine Alan brine

[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:42.160]
no no well and and when steve abrums and brine Alan i mentioned this last week

[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:45.440]
are trying to do that the five thirty to six on channel four is the worst

[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:48.780]
afforded both of you the bro and are trying to be funny and are you talking

[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:53.160]
about their tie that they're wearing and oh jeez i mean steve abrums not a bad

[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:55.880]
news guy but he's about as funny as cancer of the toning

[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.240]
well it's just not a funny guy we can

[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.860]
ahead this conversation fifteen years ago we can have it fifteen years from now

[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:05.340]
this is all a product of consultants to tell you and again it gets back to

[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.620]
the comfort factor that people want to think that the

[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.940]
anchors all of each other in point of fact in most studios there's more

[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.700]
backbiting going on it's like this radio you know in a radio station

[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:16.520]
these people hate each other if they don't hate each other they dislike them

[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.080]
and if they don't dislike them they at least nervous about them to look

[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.520]
and get their job but you got to have this nice sense on the air you know how

[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.540]
you're doing and everything else i mean a good example was when uh... uh...

[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:30.660]
it is always here on on channel uh... ten you know you'd see and him kibbits

[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:34.120]
and back and forth they hated each other they hate it but they had to do because

[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.200]
the consultant tells them that's what you got to do

[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:41.340]
uh... when they start out uh... going into the new weather for example i can use

[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:45.220]
on a monday and he says well how is your weekend i don't care how his weekend was

[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.780]
i want to know how the weather is going to be i don't i don't give two

[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:51.460]
crafts about how his weekend was and neither does anybody else the best weather

[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:55.120]
and the most efficient weather we was on sunday nights with before they had a

[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.580]
weather man uh... when they were waiting for no across the city out is is no

[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:01.720]
compete and they were trying to get sports extra on they would have to guide

[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.360]
whether it's all you know what's his name

[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.020]
house ideas or bloods that it

[01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:10.000]
yeah they would have him on and you know like two minutes before the sports you

[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.500]
go uh... tomorrow be eighty eight the lobby seventy two with twenty percent

[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:17.360]
chance to rain small or exercise question and then it going to go into a big

[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:21.120]
song about the weather anyway i got to turn on a weather chain less in less

[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.620]
is uh...

[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:26.280]
in less is a hurricane something coming in as i said many times if there's a hurricane

[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:30.740]
coming to trans and whether it becomes news so that's all you need but now you got

[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:34.340]
that brine no crest on their way funny hats and dancing around walking through

[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.980]
windows that don't exist and

[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:40.460]
no cruises a nice guy but i really resent what he's done now and what they've

[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:43.640]
done with him and they turn entirely too much time over to that

[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:48.120]
the good uh... consultant again they'll tell you and this station up as long as

[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.120]
we're picking on everyone this nonsense with these promotions are adding news

[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:54.860]
weather traffic you know what that's a product of this is going out in the street

[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:58.100]
saying to people what do you want to hear in a radio station most people don't

[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:00.660]
know what they want to hear that jesus i don't know that's like you know

[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:04.060]
pornography i i i know what it when i see it i know what i like when i hear so

[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:07.040]
what it will you want to hear news weather and try to get what i want news

[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.400]
weather and traffic that's a bunch of crap they put news weather and trapping on

[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.480]
here and take you off and i'll get a ratings low but you know something that's

[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.940]
the nature of the radio business in no matter who i've worked for it's the same

[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:21.000]
thing they despise promoting personalities because

[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.160]
they're always afraid that somebody's going to walk out the next day or drop

[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.780]
did or do something horrendous they're always terrified of that so if they can

[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:32.860]
stick with things that are generic things that are institutional they'd much

[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:36.960]
rather promote that than promote personality the same way i and z it's the same

[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.400]
way here it's always going to be what you have less time five five average the

[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:45.020]
station five three five three all right i'll tell you what five point two of that

[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:49.700]
was for you was for what's his name inside was for for sports talk in the evening

[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.980]
was for an area certainly i don't mean they're overlooking i mean i listen to an area in the

[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:57.240]
but anyway and point one of it was the news weather and traffic and if they don't

[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.700]
well everybody everybody has got news weather and traffic everybody's got

[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:04.840]
any traffic in the market 90 percent of the stations it got your brinning the crowd up there

[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:08.980]
who aren't there half the time and i never write the weather i spent two hours a day they never

[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:12.600]
ever write when they say there's an accident go to that area because you'll cruise right

[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.860]
well they bid off more than they can chew that means the accident happened an hour ago

[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:20.000]
i mean we can call it sky watch six ten or up your nose you can call anything we want but

[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.720]
everybody in a market knows that they're on channel four and channel ten and they're on this

[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.460]
station and that they're all over the place and then net net that someone like us i spend

[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:32.700]
about twelve to fourteen hours a week in the car because of my commute and they're never right

[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:38.520]
ever not one out of a hundred times by accident they run into one time jikahs with us the outspoken

[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:42.140]

right yeah and if Debbie wants to call i mean it's this up first up we'd be honored yeah

[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:45.600]
we have to use the big phone mobile hi hi i think the problem with dick and most critics is that it's

[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:52.740]
one person personal opinion absolutely that's why my name's on it and but but you obviously don't

[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:57.080]
have any idea what's happening in this market is witnessed by the fact that Rick and suds are

[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:04.740]
very popular and if he came was boring repetitive just over and over the same screaming and

[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:10.180]
harring and hanging up and rudeness in the afternoon when we're all tired of that we get that at

[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:15.500]
work we don't want to hear that on the way home man we want to laugh man have you ever heard me say

[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:20.480]
that they have a bad show have you ever seen me write that they have a bad show now you just you

[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:26.420]
want to feed them to just personally uh i think he's the one who started that i think it's enough

[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:30.940]
if not them though is they did four hours on me that's right yeah that's right i want to

[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:35.200]
at present the way everyone always does but suds is a nice guy and that's really that when i came

[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.700]
here sud came in first he says hi i'm sud you know nice to meet you we've never met i enjoy your

[01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:43.880]
column and he the absolute gentleman and the other guy comes in here like a raven banshee

[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.980]
so i know what you can't take it you can take it i can take it i can take it

[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:56.340]
you use your column to dance man i did when when i understand that you um you never

[01:06:56.420 --> 01:07:00.720]
read my column i have read your column well then well then tell me when it is you heard me

[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:06.440]
bash them because i'm on time well then when did i bash them name one time one instance oh so you

[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:13.720]
did do it no i'm asking you i i i never have i never have and in every chance every show the

[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:17.640]
them up are you and your husband dinner in any restaurant in town you can pick it if you can

[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:22.560]
find the column where i i criticize their program any restaurant that's on the air this

[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:29.020]
50,000 people are hearing it one column where i bash them uh their program at any restaurant in town

[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:36.680]
you don't bash Rick to this morning i did hear personally not professionally every program that you're

[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:42.000]
on man i haven't been on it i was on waxy and they wouldn't let me talk about it this is the first

[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.760]
moment let me let me say this i'm not here to defend time because you can do that in some book

[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:49.760]
you in other words you want him to express the opinion that you like is at it no i'm not saying

[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:55.240]
that i don't saying that once in a while it would be nice if he would admit that in spite of

[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:59.860]
what his opinion is the general public seems to think that there's a terrific show on on the

[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:05.580]
afternoon on w i o d man the only column that i've mentioned that man since they've been back here

[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:10.980]
had the line in it that they had impressive ratings in the spring book or the summer book whatever

[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:17.060]
book it was i said that when i didn't and i didn't say anything at all about the program itself

[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:21.740]
now what and what i said just a few minutes ago if you're listening is i listened to the program

[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:27.480]
when i'm in the car what more can i say when did i bash them but you did but you did qualify by

[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:31.840]
saying that you know anybody who follows nil gets a number right i did say that and what was in

[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:37.200]
it was also a book in a long time etc and so on and that's what i think grind grind some people

[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:42.200]
okay because it really takes away from getting them credit for doing anything on their own well

[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:48.220]
again it was in the context of criticizing the station for night carrying the baseball and

[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:52.800]
and and and he'd like them maybe you would write a little more than oh and they do have some

[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:56.020]
impressive numbers in the afternoon well that was the other thing i think they disappointed a lot

[01:08:56.020 --> 01:09:00.040]
of us including me as a usually there are two columns i'm still waiting for the second one the

[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:04.080]
first one with the preliminary numbers for the entire station and then the second one is a big

[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:08.440]
article which even won co-texted this time in a hero and when he scoops you on anything that it's

[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:13.020]
got to be a sorry day in health because it almost never happened where we go into detail say he'd

[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:17.500]
Tanner had this in the morning and hot had that and Rodgers did this and whatever one of the

[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:21.620]
never happened yeah no that didn't and i explained that and it's not going to satisfy you the

[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:25.700]
explanation but this book happened to come out in the midst of the period when all the new shows

[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:29.980]
were coming on i was writing three and four reviews in a space of about three weeks i must add

[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:37.280]
22 columns in the paper so i gave sure to shift shift unusual to to the radio ratings yeah that

[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:42.000]
did happen that i'll admit but that's why it happened but as far as criticizing rick and so it's

[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.460]
never happened okay thank you you see this is something that's exactly what i'm saying that was a

[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:51.840]
woman who's only listened to their program and got their information from the distorted version of

[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:56.700]
Rick and because she obviously doesn't read my column if she says that i constantly criticize her

[01:09:56.700 --> 01:10:01.240]
she can say she reads the column but she you know there's the offer it's still out there bringing one

[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:10.740]
column where i criticize them well hello yes i hesitate to even call and i wasn't going to but i

[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:17.660]
think maybe a couple of facts need to be straightened out you know you don't know who this is

[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:23.540]
the voice sounds familiar would you would you like me to not call i mean you can come

[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:27.920]
you are like this how do you do either Rick or it's Greg B. Del one of the other not Greg

[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:36.320]
Greg Donald is straight me up okay well i just since Neil was an observer when i came in that day

[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:41.920]
i you know i kind of get tired of hearing me coming in like a screaming band sheet i walked in very

[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:48.720]
quietly and didn't i shake your hand yeah okay and then and uh and uh what's his name uh Douglas

[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:53.420]
and uh hola field shook hands the other night too well Tom do you want to take off on your little

[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:58.220]
things or do you want to just talk about some facts here good i'm listening okay did i not

[01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:05.260]
well it does a band sheet walk in and shake your hand i walked in and i shook your hand and i sat

[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:09.920]
down on the seat very quietly because to tell you the truth i thought that you guys were expecting

[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:14.660]
me to come in because i had some things i wanted to talk to you about apparently i was off base

[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:19.380]
but i walked in i shook your hand i sat down on the seat very quietly because you're in the

[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:23.620]
discussion i didn't say anything and i waited until i was acknowledged that i was there and i

[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:28.180]
spoke and there was no screaming and there was no yelling you know about columns that i had written

[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:32.660]
and not not writing a column when you when you got fired at waxy wait we're talking about that

[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:37.260]
then i only wrote i only write columns about people i like which means i must like all a lot of

[01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:40.700]
people because there are three hundred and thirty eight columns we don't have a disagreement i mean

[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:44.920]
i thought that was what the discussion was about what about the friday when you spent the four hours

[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:51.580]
okay let's go to that yeah let's i timed it and Neil listens on the way home i didn't say anything

[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:56.680]
it first and i you know i kind of look at you to be an arbitrator because tom and i are in this and

[01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:00.560]
it's a lot easier to observe i mean one lunch when you say at first what do you mean the first

[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:05.020]
thirty seconds the first forty five seconds the the first was listening to that program Rick

[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:10.220]
pardon me the first about ten minutes i did something else and then for about the last 15 minutes

[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:15.540]
of the first half hour i ripped you and that's it that's it and then you open the phone do you call

[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:22.240]
is your it's the car the car did it often on sporadically till three fifteen or three thirty and i

[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:27.420]
put a stop to it no you didn't put a stop to it till you had the wrestling guy on and when you had

[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:30.980]
the wrestling guy on your side here and said well i'm gonna back off here and let's side-hand

[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:35.000]
elizcus i really know nothing about wrestling and then three seconds into the interview you said

[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.200]
one thing i like about wrestlers is they good role models for kids what can i not speak

[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:45.640]
it's my show too well i mean first of all you're right talking about us tom i'm just i'm just

[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:50.800]
you i was listening to that program Rick i heard more of that program than i hear most of your

[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.940]
progress i'm about to be off that tom stick with the facts you said i ripped you for four hours

[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:59.620]
and i didn't rip you know right away you said that i've got wrestling guy on for now that

[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:04.180]
knows it wasn't an hour's half right are you rip me for three and a half hours and tom you're a

[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:10.700]
liar okay and not only that i want to tell you that i called over to waxy this morning after

[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:15.980]
i heard that there was a steady stream of secretary of everybody including secretaries to use your

[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:21.720]
words of telling me that i was a rectal office now one person is allowed in that studio in the

[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:27.080]
morning unless you went the hallway looking for for people to find stories from your liar and

[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:32.400]
also there is not one secretary because i talked with the assistant program director michael warred

[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:39.060]
who is working there that was there what i was your liar tom okay you right Rick yeah i just made

[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:43.300]
that up right off the top man nothing else to talk about so i made that up graded grade would

[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:49.160]
probably not have many good things maybe japan probably dawn but steady stream and about three of four

[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:53.840]
what a rectal office they were about eight people they were about eight people in the office

[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:58.960]
that morning and six of seven and i'm all had something nice to say about you there's nobody

[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:05.180]
working there that was i was there until almost eleven o'clock Rick i was there until almost eleven o'clock

[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:09.520]
Rick at i.o.g you'll find that believe it or not i'm a pretty nice guy

[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:16.220]
well i'm sure you think you are well you can take a poll if you'd like tom since that seems to

[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:19.980]
be what you're into i just wanted to clear up a couple of facts you're living in fantasy we're

[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:24.280]
certainly acting like a real nice guy right now you're the guy is a star i don't like to sit here

[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:28.460]
and see your meat you know you can pick on me maybe i don't but it's okay when you do a meat

[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:32.740]
before you have a program every day Rick what do you say you're up right here for i never once said

[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:38.220]
any disparaging thing about you as a person and i never one right anybody i hope what you

[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:43.920]
think i hope does not attain that program would be real embarrassing i never once said that

[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.280]
anybody ever said what you were like i kept it between you and me i didn't bring out you didn't call

[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:54.840]
me tom jerker why didn't you didn't call me tom jerker well so what oh but you didn't say

[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:59.720]
anything bad about me now you just you made my name you called you and even twisting it to tom

[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:03.400]
jerk but i don't know you didn't say that just like nobody at what everybody you're right Rick

[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:09.640]
i made it all everybody at waxy love you um you refused to give me any credit and that's

[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:15.200]
that's my style i was talking to you tom i wasn't talking about you i was talking to you what

[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:23.240]
you don't like him i don't like what he does you don't like him and when i sat in there with you

[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:27.360]
and you'll get it looked like there was going to be this fight i just thought it was going to be fun

[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:31.840]
in the beginning let me just say this to you okay you know how many guests i have i'll write like

[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:37.420]
three a year show now tom has been coming on his show for 10 years and he and i have had some

[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:41.820]
wild disagreements in spite of the fact that some people think we have this incestuous relationship

[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:47.080]
and he thinks the world the sun rises and sets on my ass or whatever it is but the bottom line is

[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:51.120]
when a guy keeps coming in and every time he comes in which that was the third time in a row

[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:56.240]
was once with dick fero and i forget who the second time was three three times in a row come

[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:02.140]
in and somebody comes in and again i thought it was going to be fun so i take part of the responsibility

[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:07.040]
which Bennett did not let fero come in here make a circus out of that show well you know i get

[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:11.420]
kind of old it reminds me of the days when i would be on with steve and all of a sudden cider

[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:16.320]
man or someone those guys would invite himself to come in after i've been invited to stick around

[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:21.160]
and come in and sit down and plop down and start a big fist fight on the air it just it gets old

[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:26.040]
you're right i apologize i thought that i was expected to come in because we knew that we had

[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:31.100]
nothing to apologize for but the bottom line is you guys dislike each other intently

[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:36.780]
i know that though i thought that you do now the point is i do not know i didn't know the man

[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:41.540]
until that now it's personal and ugly and you hate each other like poison well you know i think

[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:46.220]
we should agree uh to hate each other is basically what it's all about you know but when you say a

[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:50.540]
steady stream of people come in and say what i don't want an ass i am and this and that and

[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:55.680]
there's seven people in the office and six and i'm say that but the fact is that people weren't

[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.900]
allowed in there but can i say something great deal of friends over there Tom and nobody

[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:03.880]
no secretaries would have let him know it i got to do a break let him say this

[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:08.700]
can i say something if you call if you if you say the bad somebody anything and the guy calls

[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:12.480]
you up and says did you say that about me what are you gonna say are you gonna yeah well i did

[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:17.780]
yeah i told time you were you whatever it's a back fighting business Rick okay trust me just

[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:22.120]
keep it in mind i mean what are we gonna do i have a trial i'll bring in my witnesses i'll bring

[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:26.560]
in Greg and the other people are there to tell you yeah they did the fact is time that you're just

[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:33.140]
taking people coming in let me ask you let me ask you let me ask you this Rick let me ask you this

[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:37.480]
day i was there that someone came in one of these nonexistent people that don't that weren't there

[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:42.340]
that day came in and said you know what time Linda Thornton when she was writing the the herald

[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:47.920]
radio column what at one point said that uh that your show was mildly amusing that's what she said

[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:51.720]
mildly amusing that wasn't good enough for you so you spent about a week ripping hers that's

[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:56.580]
true or not that's we took we did not top the auto we took her apart on the air just for saying

[01:17:56.580 --> 01:18:00.700]
that you were only mildly amusing you're displaying right now what you are you're you're a hot head

[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:06.920]

[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:12.460]
i know the news is coming up so i'm really upset i don't have a lot of time here it is

first of all i want to thank you uh nale because uh i really have to hand it to you that you

[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:25.400]
did a nice thing with w w n w s and i am a listener of all stations including you and them and everybody

[01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:31.420]
i just got back into talk radio a couple of months ago like over the summer and i even i'm a writer

[01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:35.660]
and i even wrote an essay that i hope to get printed in one of our local papers because i mean

[01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:40.140]
it's been a wonderful thing to be available have available okay so i'm very yes very devastated

[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:45.340]
that w n w s i i switch back and forth i'm a switcher i switch hitter wherever you want to call it

[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:51.760]
but in any event i'll tell you a little tidbit first then only one thing to the end um

[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:58.300]
i reconfudge right okay i was from way back i've been here almost 10 years i was into waxy when

[01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:02.880]
the first cantiflora i listened to it every morning Greg and the gang right now i had a personal

[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:07.880]
feud with Greg mind you but i still you know like the day crew there and it was a good show

[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:13.660]
now and i'll tell you honestly the minute the second that that he went on despite my argument

[01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:17.820]
with him and i had a real feud with him about something they promised to do for me do for me

[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:23.060]
i did not ever listen i could not get into work and start to not knock in that one you station

[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:27.060]
but for the point of view of this the only thing like my two cents fits in here

[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:32.320]
they're on the afternoon on your station if someone isn't looking for that but they do want the

[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:37.920]

okay i have no idea who she's talking about it's 12.06 and w i o d tom jica is our guest

[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:05.000]
the radio tv troublemaker of the poor waterdale news and son sentinel we have a lady has been so

[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.640]
patient that he's probably forgotten everything he was talking about i'm gonna sum up because i

[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:13.560]
think it's rest to go to work now here's the thing yeah so i believe you both agree there has to be

[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:17.820]
variety i mean it's nice to say everybody should listen to your show and what it's

[01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:22.140]
of course all right and those people don't like like i've always said if you don't like this show

[01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:26.840]
turn it off find something else yeah well you want to know the honest truth i i got used to you i

[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:31.700]
sometimes know i want to call complain and you you know i i like the format of your show

[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:36.680]
uh more recently rather than a few months ago but i'll tell you the truth there are times like

[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:40.620]
it's like you said you have three guests a year well if i read you the list of the people i have

[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:45.760]
gotten to speak to important people i even ambassadah from my rap i mean whether i like them

[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:50.220]
or not it's very exciting i have to tell you the truth on the talk you know radio where they have

[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:55.260]
the guest and the issue so there is room for everything i think jeperson pilot and i've been

[01:24:55.260 --> 01:25:00.280]
advertising they are neurotic beyond all belief yes i don't know how they think anybody who is

[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:05.880]
going to buy supplies on a m radio on a music although don't get crazy i do listen to jerry a

[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:10.820]
little bit i you know it night because it's like it's interesting everything's different but um

[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:19.740]
but a m is not the place for music as far as i'm concerned all right it's strictly for people

[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:25.580]
like you or issue oriented shows and i'll and so therefore that's a complete error what they did

[01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:31.880]
as for this reconciling a lot of the personalities uh i have found all the idlers thing to do radio

[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:36.540]
now they get some of them admittedly do get an attitude in any kind of show this right

[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:40.920]
well rick riley and i like that i like reconciled both of them but i will be added as rick has an

[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:49.100]
attitude there's no question about right so i think you would have no young you know and he can

[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:53.600]
call it too called the call before rick riley what you were saying about me bashing i've never said a

[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:59.360]
cross word about rick riley in my car because i don't even know no i had a column yeah well no it

[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:04.860]
been how i rule yeah the same place he did to me yeah but rick riley's problem and this goes back

[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:09.320]
to the original time when he came in here the the last time i was here is that i've never written

[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:13.980]
a column saying that he's the greatest thing since light beer that's his problem he needs that he

[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:18.740]
just admitted that when the court and was used at the harrow wrote the night mildly amusing which

[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:23.300]
is kind of a compliment and he ripped up for a week he said he's on words i didn't know what i have to

[01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:28.540]
question about how old is he rick old enough to know york a final i jacquim i really don't know how

[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:33.720]
i hold it about 40ish that's about 40 days between 35 and 40 yeah well then he's really old and i

[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:39.660]
thought he was tell you the truth one last twenty nine i think what last thing and ask a favor i

[01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:44.980]
wanted to tell you one last story yeah i was in my army seventy four to seventy five or seventy

[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:50.320]
five to seventy six and that was my first experience at talk radio and i was a big day vote day

[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:56.100]
vote day of larry i was a regular on a show when he was on io d on your station okay and i have

[01:26:56.100 --> 01:27:00.220]
a nickname i'm not going to say what it is because i'm doing business with him now all right larry

[01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:04.680]
was one of the great entertainer right he got started here he'll call the so i mean he may be

[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:08.700]
over you know spreading himself to thinnages i'll tell you one of the story though i could i

[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:13.900]
talk to him about three weeks ago from his home are too lucky well i kind of felt i was um this is

[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:18.340]
if you would call me from home the thing is the thing with the show we did you know the Sunday show

[01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:21.580]
and i like what the end of it unfortunately but i'm the lion tell him i saw the whole thing

[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:27.620]
but he was asked to do that by his age and bernie brilstein said it up he didn't go looking for

[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:32.660]
that to the best of my knowledge he just did it one shot it is no contract with NBC or any thank

[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:39.360]
well you know whatever but the point is uh i i kind of like him and he's had his problems and so we

[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:44.720]
all so you know i guess you'll get fun at it but you know i'm not each other i mean everybody

[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:49.600]
about each theme on this on the radio well that's what makes some people handled it better than

[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:54.180]
that when you can when you can deal with it for what it is you're a lot better off and when you

[01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:59.280]
start taking it personally and getting hysterical you know what it's a self-sufficient process to

[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:03.860]
less thing it's to this day i am not clear as to whether Neil really does or does not like

[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:09.780]
rent i'm not sure if it's a gag or i'm not sure i really can't tell you want me do you want me to

[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:15.960]
answer the question very simply do you all right i like to know you sick are you the desert

[01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:24.300]
don't give our a matter have a great day okay hey we like musical responses to everything on a

[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:29.780]
station it's 10 past noon on radio hysteria where we just make your blood boil where everybody

[01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:36.280]
hates each other and we're happy about it is it evidently that way jeez i'm in a good way i feel great

[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:42.880]
i feel excellent today we have an opalign on the starline at star i od i will say this i hope that

[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:48.180]
i i just i don't know why i'm compelled to say it i hope rick riley never forgets as long as he

[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:54.780]
lives the joy rentals rust oasis episode if he ever doubts that i support those guys any afternoon

[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:59.840]
i mean i went the extra yard because that pissed me off the i think anything that i've ever been

[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:04.880]
involved with in this business that was one of the worst that they conned me into this clandestine

[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:10.160]
dinner and allegedly for then they denied that there was ever any saddle idea that no no no

[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:16.020]
and it just the most blatant blatant attempt for me to go to boy gary and get them can so he could

[01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:20.540]
get a job because the man's desperate for work a guy who couldn't even get a one on the weekend

[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:27.060]
they can't have a card board audience on radio oh jeez joey you're the worst she's this almost

john mcq yeah you know that list that list you ought to mail to every broadcast school in country

[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:05.480]
Gilbert oh do you remember Steve Gilbert oh geez they hired him i forget there was during the late

[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:09.980]
period when i came back from Nashville and chrome was busy trying to destroy the station and they put

[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:15.900]
him on on the weekend and he was like doing some fill-in and weekend he was one of the worst i have

[01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:21.720]
never in my life he may joys seem like uh David Letterman i mean this guy and i'll never forget the

[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:26.480]
night he was on here late nights i think it was doing like midnight to six or something 12 30 in the

[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:32.940]
morning he calls home and he's got like a nine or ten-year-old kid he says Tommy did mommy and i

[01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:40.520]
get divorced because i was in radio he's asking his little kid why oh geez i mean this guy so

[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:48.000]
Steve Gilbert w and w and he never he was like sandy paton and drag i mean that monotone oh geez how

[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.780]
could i have left him off the list that's like calling somebody and calling waxian saying my

[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:58.220]
nice guy between Milton Fisher and Steve Gilbert novelist is rounding out nicely my Emmy hello yes

[01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:05.380]
yeah you know i uh listen to uh what's been going on here and of course the thing that i would

[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:11.040]
ask for to you because and that's the economic side of the argument as to why why the station died

[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:20.920]
the and i make reference to uh that's why uh you're a bastard the uh what's up sir

[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:29.640]
the uh the thing that that used to confound me is kneels big numbers and all the criticism uh

[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:34.960]
where you guys were talking earlier the station's got to stick by and uh you know to go ahead and make

[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:40.520]
make a good show or make a good reputation and but i guess the thing that i'm asking is is

[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:47.780]
there's was a demise because they couldn't sell the show but yet neo haven't you uh talked about

[01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:53.760]
how uh management doesn't go along with you and yet you're pulling out the big numbers uh uh what

[01:35:53.760 --> 01:36:00.220]
drives the the the reason for talk radio because i think i think i have it said management doesn't go

[01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:05.080]
along with me i said management is dumb which they are and they don't listen to your suggestions which

[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:10.080]
they don't but in terms of um interfering with what you do or just totally putting the clamps on

[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:15.820]
you they don't do that um but but still if you've got the good numbers that means that you've got

[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:20.520]
a pretty good sense of what the uh the market is about and so that if uh i mean if i was the

[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:24.580]
guy that was uh holding the uh the purse strings and so and you come up to me and said okay look

[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:30.080]
why don't you go ahead and do a format uh that does this this and this uh for example when you were at

[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:36.040]
WNWS uh and then they said yeah but that was de cassebur and they did it you see he listened and

[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:41.120]
the station went from no from point one's we finally had a six point four was the the glory book

[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:46.980]
that we had like an uh 81 in the spring of 81 a four from nowhere yeah the the thing with uh

[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:52.320]
WNWS is that they're owned by an insurance company in north carolina and there's nothing more

[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:57.460]
conservative than an insurance company uh and and they would just they didn't want any controversy

[01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:01.740]
and you can't do that without having contact with them let me let me give you another example

[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:08.200]
when i was at wyng i did eight to midnight okay and it was um i had some younger people but mostly

[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:14.280]
that topic uh or issue-oriented geriatric talk okay then i convinced them finally because the

[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:18.520]
news numbers during the daytime were dismal put me on and the daytime kickass we did i want

[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:23.780]
to put in one book and nine share okay then i went over to zeta did the same thing kicked everybody's

[01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:32.820]
answer but the bottom line is that guy gannett broadcasting out of Portland main not unlike

[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:39.480]
jeferson pilot is a very yahoo a conservative outfit they were terrified and petrified by the

[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:43.700]
controversy by everything that stand and i were doing they didn't have the stomach for talking

[01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:49.640]
at least to their credit i mean in in a perverse way at least they finally in as much said okay we

[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:54.060]
were all news we want to be all news we don't have the stomach for this everybody go have a good

[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:58.480]
life and we just can't handle it anymore and they couldn't yeah but if there if if i'm making the

[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:04.660]
bottom line okay if you if i project and i say okay we're making uh because of uh the recommendations

[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:08.960]
that i'm taking from the guys that are in the seats and they're saying okay i'm getting a good

[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.960]
rate of return on the investment i'm saying hey go out there take the eat now but a big company won't

[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:20.320]
do that yeah what i'm not sure if this is what i'm not sure how about infinity broadcaster and how

[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:23.940]
it's stirring that's not a little bit like that. Coxbrook they've always been the for foxes

[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:28.700]
different situation too and that it's family held and not answering the stockholders and that

[01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:32.620]
makes a big difference. But the profit isn't enough then to go ahead and listen to what works.

[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:37.760]
They just don't want the controversy feel that they can make the money in other way these

[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:43.440]
organizations they make so much money in their other mainline of business that you know it

[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:48.780]
really is. Just enterprise versus the other interests. Yeah they just don't want to fear afraid

[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:54.320]
that and the people who orchestrate these type of campaigns what they do is they go after them

[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:59.520]
where they live they say not only will we destroy your radio station will destroy your insurance

[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:05.740]
company and they get nervous. They don't want it. They say well there's a lot of ways to make money

[01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:09.840]
but even but you're giving them too much credit even forgetting about people that go after them to

[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:14.220]
use that expression before any of that ever happened they were losing maybe they had that

[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:19.100]
geriatric audience they don't know I mean we're making it too complicated they don't know how to win

[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:24.940]
they ruined WGBS which is a major station with a big signal they ruined WNWS which a lot of us

[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:29.360]
had worked hard and built to a major factor in this market with big numbers and demographics they

[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:33.360]
weren't all geriatric we had a lot of living and breathing people and they destroyed it and they

[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:37.780]
wouldn't change and they wouldn't even run anywhere. When you say they destroyed it okay they did. Yeah

[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:43.280]
but what I'm saying is as that happens doesn't the dollar the economics come in to say hey you

[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:48.680]
know that's a dumb move but they don't know any better they don't know any better and they just

[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:52.240]
kept going with it and going with it and going with it waiting for some miracle to happen which

[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:58.100]
never did so now their answer is to can almost everybody to cut the to cut the overhead down

[01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:02.480]
to virtually nothing and so even the minimal billing that they've got they're going to cut their

[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:07.220]
losses on an AM life has got big numbers with their music on the FM that's how they're going to

[01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:11.420]
make money another way they got that AM license they don't know how to make any money with it. Bottom line

[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:17.120]
I go ahead and say okay I'm going to buy a station you know what is it take to put a station

[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:22.700]
to buy one by that and then a monthly operating cost and then what kind of a percent profit on your

[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:29.260]
return. The cost you're about a million dollars per cheap station and AM station and then

[01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:32.840]
I'll put what's a monthly operating. Well that's the point it depends you know you know what if you

[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:37.760]
want to buy an AM station the best thing to do is do like the people at VWVCG it has no public

[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:43.960]
service value broker the time sell it to the Haitians and the how this group and aggregate the same

[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:48.960]
thing broker out the time religious nuts whatever it is get the money from them you've got no overhead

[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:52.900]
they put on their own programs you make you make a fortune the people that don't on WVCG are making

[01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:57.260]
over a million dollars a year clear profit and what they got on the year I wouldn't wish on anybody

[01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:01.960]
okay but that's unfortunately what radio you know. But what I'm saying is that I think it's really

[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:07.760]
stupid when I when a guy that has demonstrated your track record and that you you know because

[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:14.540]
I always wonder why you you don't do the talk topics the issue or any stuff. It doesn't work.

[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:20.620]
It's history doesn't it. Great. I agree but I don't need money here one day about three years ago

[01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:26.220]
and I said this is even boring me so I remember I would never go back to what sir you've got to

[01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:31.120]
have a feel for what goes and you come to feel and that's a really amazing that people don't listen to

[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:36.240]
you to take it back then they never will. Listen we're doing okay. Yeah continue success. Thanks.

[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:43.320]

[01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:05.620]
the mild mannered Tom jikies our guest is 1227 at WIOD a troublemaker radio let's go to a mobile

[01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:14.180]
and Jupiter all right yes sir speak to me hello Neil yes yes I was just calling to have

[01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:22.760]
Mr. Jikap if why doesn't the subject matter work on talk radio they work on TV with your

[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:27.440]
open and all the rest of them well you know and that's part of the reason that is exactly part of

[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:31.300]
the reason I mentioned it in a column I did you know a month ago predicting what would happen to

[01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:37.420]
W.A.W.S. and you know there's your base core topics as we say abortion done control by olingo

[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:42.100]
there's some all those things and then to take some of the eduof that you fill in with some of

[01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:46.180]
these bizarre shows and those are the people now that you're getting on over and done in you

[01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:52.080]
you know the transvestite lesbian midget nines and all that other crap and because they're there

[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:57.180]
they've stripped away a lot of the guests that used to hit the talk show circuit you can't do

[01:43:57.180 --> 01:44:01.820]
on again every day you know herald she might see herald will claim that he was going to clean up

[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:08.480]
his jacket all that last I turned it on yesterday and he's doing a rape on college campuses rape

[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:13.060]
and violence on college campus which is I mean granted so legitimate topic but just to see the way

[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:19.500]
he exploits everything you know he's not kidding anybody margate hey there yes sir yeah I got

[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:25.160]
an answer to the rick ralley time jk a problem okay I think what we need to do is we get both in

[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:29.960]
the desert don't give them a man no no we need a wrestling ring gonna have the wrestle we'll have

[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:34.440]
Gordon solely referee it I got a better idea than wrestling why don't we get the farting post

[01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:40.560]
well rick rick the those wrestlers are good role models for kids you know the violence is the answer

[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:44.800]
and somebody the somebody's different kill them they're wonderful role models we have

[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:48.480]
figure we can kill three birds of one stone because we can air this during the ranny martinjo

[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:53.640]
yeah there you go I'll tell you what rick's got me out way big I mean I don't know if you know

[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:58.060]
we're in different weight classes and different we'd like to let him fly him up the time

[01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:01.520]
George and Tom go ahead at first they're about the same size then we'll work up to him we could

[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:05.120]
have the movie like the defiant one show handcuffed the two of us together and put us on a train

[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:10.700]
yeah and that and I think Steve Key is gonna do okay and then on fpl because he's you know

[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:17.520]
we the firebrand he's different well let me just say the reason I have no no problem with having

[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:21.680]
him call in and promoting the fact he's gonna be honest because I don't think he's gonna take five

[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:26.260]
of those years that rick and suds have an apno because that's a totally different kind of audience

[01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:29.960]
yeah the people are listening to this station our people are not interested in hearing the

[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:35.060]
year-end lady and the brevrens and the ministers and the hellis Ruben and those people who want that

[01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:39.480]
stuff they'll go over there and more power to them you know I think that's fine why use to listen

[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:44.540]
to them way back I speed delivery driver and sometimes I had to turn it off because some of the

[01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:48.100]
guests he had were really just too far out I mean you know it's like if these people are like

[01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:53.680]
drills oh yeah you know they had a bna breath in the head of the cooklux clan you can bet David

[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:58.140]
Duke will be on which would be a good guess that yeah David Duke on there with you know probably

[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:02.100]
off the title bomb yeah be good you get some yellow and some screaming some hatred

[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:08.160]
I said today and you know it's all gotten lost in this I said that a lot of days I used to listen

[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:12.680]
to Steve but a lot of days the same as you it would be so far out that I would turn them off

[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:17.140]
and I'll turn to everything about Steve too and talk about people doing pouring things when he

[01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:24.140]
was at WNWS before Fowler came in he was a lot more controversial a lot more emotional a lot

[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:28.700]
more exciting on here and then Fowler came in and performed the operation I like to call it yeah

[01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:33.860]
and even over here he never really went back to that kind of you say firebrand I wouldn't agree

[01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:37.920]
with that word maybe we'll be now but I never want to know before it's time boy hungry now he's

[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:43.280]
like I got to make a living yeah but I think he was at his best though on this on your station

[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:47.700]
when he didn't even have a guest on when it was just him and the callers and you know that wasn't

[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:52.080]
always his own choice unfortunately the powers that be here felt that without a guest he was lost

[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:56.480]
that was their feeling and so they force that him to have guest after guest after get and a

[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:01.520]
problem like I said and I know it because I did topical talk for uh 12 years in this market

[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:05.560]
they just start that many good guests here there's nobody here who you gonna have on after you

[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:09.320]
have the mayor and the dog catcher on a couple of times uh there's nobody left there is nobody

[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:14.620]
here that that's it for as far as your topics because I mean you can you know watch TV news

[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:19.780]
or any of these other you know donnie what you wind up with is you wind up with whoever's on the

[01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:24.400]
circuit selling a book yeah that's pretty much what it all is and people get sick of it I mean it's

[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:29.360]
like this um the thing over in the Iraq I mean you know it's on 24 hours a day seven days a week and

[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:33.840]
you know you bring on like the Iraqi ambassador like Kinghead who cares yeah you don't think

[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:37.400]
guys gonna sit there and say oh we're we're right you're wrong you know see another thing that

[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:43.320]
happened when GBS entered into the uh marked picture here is that really helped to kill I mean

[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:46.920]
good competition is one thing but when you have too much competition and too much of the same

[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:52.040]
thing and a lot of it is bad it kills it and then you wind up with the same old voices you could

[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:55.940]
when we had the four stays into a talk you could literally turn from one station to another

[01:47:55.940 --> 01:48:01.240]
and hear the same old chronic regular five minutes later here among another station saying exactly

[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:06.380]
the same thing yeah that was not it wasn't on you to go to offer a guest to be on say this station

[01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:11.960]
the morning with Andy and then on at night with uh or or if there was something hot like uh

[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:16.920]
immigration or bilingualism you could go from morning noon and night and every host on four

[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:20.720]
different stations all talking about the same thing and that's what happened nationwide with

[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:25.940]
topical talk may and became so desperate that most of it went either to news or talk and as a result

[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:31.060]
people are talked out they've heard everything said about the the death penalty about abortion about

[01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:35.660]
any of those tried and true 20 topics there's nothing left to be said it's all been said a thousand

[01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:40.900]
times and it gets real dull well hope you guys have a good one in time you know I still want to see

[01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:45.360]
the wrestling match and I do think you know and such should they do the commentage with Gordon

[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:50.240]
Sully referee and you're in a Randy Martin show well I'll concede Rick would Rick would kick my butt

[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:55.360]
well we can do much too bad I want Alex Bennett yeah well Alex Bennett I went you said if he had

[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:59.440]
the ability he tear the hairs right off Alex who said we did that again that white white

[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:02.640]

[01:49:38.540 --> 01:49:42.280]
looks like he matured minutes he was hanging out and ate some brownies and a few other things yeah

[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:46.760]
because he was gone I mean this guy would get off the air and like he wouldn't talk to any

[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:50.540]
of the people that he invited over he'd like just avoid him ignore him you know and all you know

[01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:54.700]

[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:29.120]
ought to kiss the guy to go out there and kiss Alex on the forehand if it wasn't for Alex Bennett

[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:34.160]
Eric Lambert would be still be schlepping they stand up routine up there and brow at these flop

[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:39.780]
houses so so he gave an opportunity to a lot of people who are terminal who are when anybody who

[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:45.680]
worked at a company exactly bring him off the street and it was just deadly it was just deadly but

[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:50.100]
you know that happens to a lot of people and that's one reason that I'm real reluctant to leave

[01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:55.640]
here I've invested 15 years in this market next March first will be 15 years and yeah I'm doing

[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:59.540]
fine okay but you never know you can you can be the greatest things in sliced bread you go to New

[01:50:59.540 --> 01:51:03.880]
Yorkers your connoisseur this place or that place and if they don't take to you right away or if

[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:07.440]
you have to suddenly make a big adjustment of what you used to do doesn't make it anymore you

[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:10.420]
could be all through and if he would have stayed here he'd have been people out here and I question

[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:14.720]
all the time why doesn't he'll go to New York ago and I've that's exactly what I've told you you

[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:18.620]
just don't know where your act is gonna play in addition to which you go to New York you got to

[01:51:18.620 --> 01:51:22.940]
make two or three times the amount of money you're making here at least just to be in the same spot I

[01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:27.200]
don't know you know I hate to be in New York fashion because I live there and everything but even being

[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:32.880]
up there for this four days how those people put up with a day in and day out that hassles the

[01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:38.460]
traffic the holes I mean when I talk and pine holes were talking craters craters and this isn't even

[01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:42.400]
a snowy season it's got to get worse now these are the ones that are left over from last year and if

[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:45.740]
you want to go across the George Washington bridge I had to go to the airport something I had to

[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:53.100]
look at you two hours to get eleven miles it's how and and this was a Sunday night with nothing going

[01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:57.680]
on Sunday night at seven o'clock why should the George Washington bridge been busy there was nobody

[01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:02.100]
there was nobody coming home from the Jersey Shore stand it you get to the tribe or bridge it's

[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:07.180]
you know you got to wait you're about 60th in line to pay the toll and you got some person in there

[01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:11.400]
who hates their job and makes no effort to do it fast and they count the money as if you know

[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:15.240]
they have arthritis and they don't give a damn that the traffic is backed up into into the

[01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:20.940]
battery just doesn't matter to them everybody's got alarms and bars on their windows and you know

[01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:25.260]
three German shepherds in their house and speaking of German shepherds in their house then they take

[01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:29.000]
the German shepherds out in the street you got to walk watch where you're going to walk I mean I grew

[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.160]
up in New York and I wouldn't trade it for nothing but anybody who talks with any kind of romantic

[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:38.440]
glowing times in New York is out of their mind that New York doesn't exist anymore that's what you

[01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:43.560]
mean says the same thing when I came back then the New York that people sing about does not exist that's

[01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:49.340]
Camelot. 1237 at W.I.O.D. time's going to give us some opinions in a while we have a hard time

[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:53.020]
getting them to do that Rick and Suds will be here at two to six this afternoon probably with a

[01:52:53.020 --> 01:52:56.140]
couple of opinions of their own what is that no that's not right or you want me to let that it's a

[01:52:56.140 --> 01:53:03.340]
piece of copy time just relax your so damn hyper calm down it's 23 pill one at W.I.O.D. and we'll be right back

[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:17.160]
1241 at W.I.O.D. let's take a call from Sunrise now yes sir I talked we told a little TV anything

[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:22.240]
you want why is it what's the reason with these networks telling October and already Murphy Brown

[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:28.040]
and one to use is a rerunning just the the one week well the one the years last but I wondered

[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:31.780]
about that myself because it wasn't supposed to be a rerun they had a different show list and

[01:53:31.780 --> 01:53:36.540]
TV guide they ran into some production problems and they thought they would be up against the

[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:42.260]
world series so they stuck in a rerun figuring you know nothing nothing gave nothing lost and

[01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:46.780]
they save an original episode for later in the season Murphy Brown last night was this was the

[01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:51.460]
last week before the swings you see what is you mentioned two good shows the good shows take long

[01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:58.320]
and a make they put some care into them quality takes time so they don't get them churned out as

[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:02.980]
quickly as the shows that you you know who cares so every now and then they get backed up in

[01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:07.400]
production rather than have these people operating with a gun to their head they give them a one

[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:12.420]
week break and and then they can they can operate it a human pace if you let somebody operate it a

[01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:17.140]
human pace they'll do better work what style of this excuse for way until November start oh that's

[01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:22.020]
simple there was world series games on almost every you have every you see what they didn't want to

[01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:26.040]
do they could have put Dallas on premier week in September but then it would have been on for a week

[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:28.720]
and then it would have been off for three weeks then it would have been on for another week and

[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:33.140]
off for another week and because it's a serial they thought the best thing to do was wait started

[01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:38.060]
fresh and and then just play it right through because it's it's harder to preempt a serial than

[01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:42.860]
just a normal episode because there's that continuity like Neil gets nuts when nice landing disappears

[01:54:42.860 --> 01:54:47.720]
for a couple of weeks yeah you can make people wait a week for it to see the story get resolved but

[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:53.140]
when you ask them two and three weeks at a clip and doing it regularly and at the first time one

[01:54:53.140 --> 01:54:57.920]
network ever had to play us in the world series he had almost three full weeks of baseball all right

[01:54:58.020 --> 01:55:03.520]
well you would have a lot of job they do with that well well talk about not planning I saw a movie for

[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:09.800]
HBO deception with neglect Sheridan Harry Hamlin that was HBO that was showtime showtime I rented it

[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:14.360]
can you explain it no I had no idea what happened I just loved her because she was

[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:20.160]
unrest from up the movie exactly I'll say a story back there yeah I have no idea I just want to

[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:25.060]
yesterday I'm trying to explain nothing in the movie well yeah let me tell you we were uh she was

[01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:29.940]
just in this thing lucky chances that NBC had so they had her out in the press to a last summer

[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:35.580]
so after the question and the session for uh for the NBC miniseries a couple of critics who

[01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:40.960]
felt the same way we all watched it for the sex scene and uh none of us knew what what what so we

[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:45.580]
we caught her afterwards and we said think like could you explain the plot to us and she just laughed

[01:55:45.580 --> 01:55:49.400]
and she says oh you're about the hundredth person who's asked me didn't make any sense to us either

[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:54.160]
because when they shot the husband you're really shot exactly and she did it and

[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:59.400]
and the guy did come in and he was going to attack and all the scenes when she was alone with no

[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:03.180]
camera it was just the camera and her it looked like she was really afraid she said the best and

[01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:06.920]
remember now she's in it and this is the guys on a shoot these are on words she said the best

[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:11.180]
she could figure it was originally it was supposed to be in a dream and then in the middle someone

[01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:15.840]
forgot that and took it in an entirely different direction she looks good though no they don't

[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:19.620]
shoot these things in order you shoot you might shoot the last scene of the movie and then two

[01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:23.120]
middle scenes you've been in the corner knows that the best days in our planning was two seasons ago

[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:26.820]
and Nicola Chirden and Pat Pierce and we're rolling around naked on every episode that's when it

[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:30.880]
was great remember on the what you call a croquet course which had the strip croquet with the

[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:35.120]
sound of it yes sir that she rolls around naked with Harry Hamlin which means she has that very good

[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:42.340]
taste and she doesn't have anything to worry about oh we have a great day okay so 1244 trust me at W.I.O.D

[01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:47.940]
we have an open line and Broward 524 9463 and also on a star line at star I.O.D if we have any more

[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:53.520]
radio celebrities they want to call in we've had John McHugh we had Steve Kane we had Alice

[01:56:53.520 --> 01:57:00.500]
off the air with little a tidbit or two boy got only knows what it'll be next maybe Sandy I got it

[01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:09.520]
and talk about people saying bad things what about oh she didn't look too to her effect she had

[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:13.660]
those dark eyes on and I'm just talking about the way that they a ripper hear all the people

[01:57:13.660 --> 01:57:18.220]
used to work with her oh man unbelievable and I'm sure she called them and asked them they'd

[01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:24.660]
all deny it they'd say oh yeah we said that homestead hey Neil yes sir hey Tom okay uh before I

[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:29.460]
wish Rick Rattie what they called I think he just made his casing it worse than it was before

[01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:35.260]
yeah well at least you know he I saw that thing the name on the screen and I deliberated for 20

[01:57:35.260 --> 01:57:39.820]
seconds and I thought well let's give everybody their say and get it over with yeah I wasn't

[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:44.720]
wasn't the essence of his call that he's not a hothead oh yeah no doubt about it not you know

[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:49.740]
I'll tell you some uh I don't think says just you're enough credit for making that sure what it is

[01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:55.460]
sides is such as the humor there sides is a real gentleman too yeah he's a laid-back guy and he

[01:57:55.460 --> 01:58:01.500]
he does have to play off Riley real well then if it was Riley without Sudd there wouldn't be a show

[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:05.120]
yeah but see I think that's the part about that show that makes it good is that they're both

[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:09.300]
different there's a chemistry there and Riley's the hothead and Sudd is like laid-back and

[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:14.480]
real low-key and it that's that's what makes it I mean nobody says you've got to be Mr. Mello or

[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:19.020]
Mr. Perfect off the earth I have a great show it's like the cops the good cop bad cop thing but

[01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:24.200]
sure yeah time they'll go 15 20 minutes and you hardly won't hear a word from Sudd and then

[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:28.120]
it'll just say something that's so funny you want to drive off the road well he's he's the one

[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:32.520]
that comes up with a funny stuff what I call to ask and he's a real gentleman too again I stress

[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:42.200]
oh he is no with wf you and was it ever off the 790 frequency was it ever 710

[01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:48.800]
not what wf you and was it always 790 yeah I'm sure it must have been I think it's good yes

[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:54.300]
gbs and nws to combine okay well one wonder is like you know we used to go here host

[01:58:54.300 --> 01:59:00.140]
to we used to get wf you and wq a real strong right but the tower used to be on candle for

[01:59:00.140 --> 01:59:05.220]
acumen oh I heard that's before I came here I know the office was on the office was on

[01:59:05.220 --> 01:59:10.260]
sunset drive yeah all I know is that by the time I got here just before it switched to wnws

[01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:15.460]
the signal of f you went and deteriorated so badly it was almost like off the year terrible

[01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:21.500]
I always just wonder about that all right you hear one more question now the target audience for

[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:27.360]
for you know so and so and shows is like 25 to 54 right that's the one most advertise is one

[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:33.780]
okay because the welfare general had about a week or so ago that 55 and older control most

[01:59:33.780 --> 01:59:39.900]
the money in this country this guy I was arguing a word about especially when they do but there's

[01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:44.180]
a difference they don't spend it right no they do spend that they spend more than younger people

[01:59:44.180 --> 01:59:48.360]
I mean you know they what the hell they're gonna take a with them the problem is that the

[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:52.320]
perception of advertisers right or wrong is that they're setting their ways that they're not

[01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:57.180]
as susceptible to new products and most of your advertising is done for for new products

[01:59:57.180 --> 02:00:02.780]
all right okay well when you go into a car dealership for example look around and see what the

[02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:06.760]
median age of most of the people is you're not going to see too many people 75 buy a new car every

[02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:12.820]
year that's true okay me and she's what do you think this count do once I I turned that on once

[02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:17.300]
the sun came up down here because you know we're we're way far south of that transmitter up there

[02:00:17.300 --> 02:00:24.060]
and there had to be you had to be you Johnny may I guess what are you gonna do with this fail

[02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:29.600]
do you gonna take your blame or what are they gonna do I don't what did Joe and apparently is selling

[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:35.020]
a combination right I mean this thing is gonna have if it's possible it's gonna have demographics

[02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:40.980]
even worse than W.A.W.S. had yeah yeah I absolutely they're gonna sell it in combination with WLIF

[02:00:40.980 --> 02:00:46.900]
which I'm gonna call it they're gonna call it life and death well have a great day 1248 and WI would do

[02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:04.940]
my brother wants to have Tom something go ahead doc hey Tom yeah I want to know what you feel

[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:10.220]
about the new episode of the flash I thought the pilot was wonderful wasn't yeah I thought the

[02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:15.400]
pilot was I think you know it gets all real quick how many times I did the effect are real good and

[02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:20.420]
you know I've been watching lately and you know I would think that they would die down use the

[02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:25.560]
same you know from the first one the same effect but it's been quite pretty well with it yeah I

[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:31.860]
was predisposed not to like that show because I'm not a fan of that that kind of science fiction

[02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:38.800]
but they impressed me I gave it a very very favor review I love it I love it hey Tom what do you think

[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:44.100]
it's when peace I think it's bizarre I don't I don't really care who killed Laura Palmer I find all

[02:02:44.100 --> 02:02:48.000]
the people fascinating yeah that's the same way I feel I think if it's gonna laugh yes the

[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:53.540]
deal with crazy people it's kind of kind of fun yeah you just can't take it seriously all right I hope

[02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:58.740]
I hope it lasts well it will the demographics are very good you think even on Saturday the last

[02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:02.560]
yeah don't look at the ratings the demographics for the show to refer they're getting people there

[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:07.360]
that they never got before it's for the same reason that NWS had problems because their ratings

[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:12.120]
weren't all that bad but their demographics were well the same with with twin peaks their ratings aren't

[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:17.840]
that good but the demographics are good advertisers don't buy ratings anymore they buy certain audience

[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:23.500]
segments I mean even when I run you know I run the the 12 plus ratings when I do my rating story

[02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:28.480]
because you know that's kind of like the horse race competition just overall viewers but you know

[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:32.980]
that's really misleading the same as on Thursday when you get the TV ratings the overall ratings aren't

[02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:38.760]
all that important like Cosby has been beaten the Simpsons regularly but the Simpsons has more viewers

[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:42.920]
than Cosby and you know if you want I'll take a half hour and explain to you how that could be

[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:48.500]
but essentially what it comes down to is that Cosby in a lot of those homes there's only one or two

[02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:53.580]
people watching the show where the Simpsons they find this four or five people watching so the

[02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:58.080]
rating you see in the paper is a household rating they got to multiply that by the number of people

[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:02.100]
in the household so the Simpsons actually has more people watching than Cosby I don't like

[02:04:02.100 --> 02:04:07.100]
guys that want them very much yeah can I say hello to some of my friends please yes sir

[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:16.160]

[02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:15.160]

[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:19.640]
mention Tom's name when you do it okay I'll never see it okay all right Neil thanks a lot thanks

[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:29.100]
1256 hostility radio 610 WIOD let's go to Hollywood yes hey how are you great listen I have a

[02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:35.920]
couple questions I want to ask you yeah okay the first one is what do you think of the the local

[02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:42.800]
news team do you think that they should be replaced by network news team what the anchors all right

[02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:48.120]
like on channel uh you know let's bring in Dan Rather yeah I'm sure Tom Brocle is just anxious to

[02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:54.280]
come down here and work on child floor I mean to hire executive like NBC news team instead of

[02:05:54.280 --> 02:06:01.860]
hiring local people that live here do you have any concept that television works yes I do I don't

[02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:07.020]
think you mean by executive NBC news team what does that mean well I mean uh people that you know

[02:06:07.020 --> 02:06:13.640]
work in the field like uh doing national news like on NBC or ABC but what would they know about

[02:06:13.690 --> 02:06:20.670]
this community but what's wrong with having you know people that know you know like network news

[02:06:20.670 --> 02:06:25.870]
and you know what do you want what I don't know it makes no sense to me we have local people who do

[02:06:25.870 --> 02:06:29.530]
the local news and we have network people who do national news and they're pretty simple

[02:06:30.570 --> 02:06:34.830]
isn't it right do you want a guy in New York right in the back next Tuesday's election in

[02:06:34.830 --> 02:06:39.850]
high alia no well that's what you saying well I'll scratch it I have it okay let's move out of

[02:06:39.850 --> 02:06:45.610]
the next one it's got to be better it is what do you think about scrambling I hate it you know but

[02:06:45.610 --> 02:06:51.110]
I hate it for a selfish reason did you think that they're gonna start scrambling am an FM radio station

[02:06:51.110 --> 02:06:58.050]
I think they are oh well he's having you know you know the spot that says this is your brain

[02:06:58.050 --> 02:07:02.510]
and yeah that there is the guy yeah let's go to pomp it up I remember when you used to do nights

[02:07:02.510 --> 02:07:06.050]
and topics and sometimes you get some of those women who are into the bottle you know what did

[02:07:06.050 --> 02:07:10.610]
you do time yeah this guy he's got an early study must be Hannah with Henry hello hey

[02:07:10.610 --> 02:07:16.070]
how's it going good hey Tom with shaking oh me uh because I actually think we out of people from

[02:07:16.070 --> 02:07:20.470]
time and news week right in the local newspaper here yeah Rick's got to be in here in a little bit

[02:07:20.470 --> 02:07:26.970]
so I'm shaking yeah Tom I was wondering is the satellite seeds that they're using on AM now is

[02:07:26.970 --> 02:07:33.390]
that like the wave of the future or oh I've been doing that for years it's just a you usually

[02:07:33.390 --> 02:07:37.930]
in a market this size you don't get radio stations doing that they program their own I mean I've

[02:07:37.930 --> 02:07:43.510]
even heard news that was satellite on certain stations almost all the news you hear is satellite it

[02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:47.550]
I mean it'll be a mutual and everything comes from the network is now on satellite what would

[02:07:47.550 --> 02:07:54.310]
stereo AM like would that inject new light into AM would that save it I don't think so how would

[02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:59.570]
it save it well I know maybe the music sound would be better it would be what sound just like FM

[02:07:59.570 --> 02:08:03.210]
the only problem the only problem is then everybody in America would have to go out and buy a new

[02:08:03.210 --> 02:08:07.650]
radio in order to be able to pick it up that's that's a problem you need a wide a band don't you

[02:08:07.650 --> 02:08:13.270]
no well I mean no it's just you need different receiver that's all it sounds just as good as FM

[02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:20.550]
I mean if they did go to AM stereo would would there be a or stations on AM would that sure

[02:08:20.550 --> 02:08:27.670]
why not I suppose there would be sure but one of the reasons there's no big push for it is that

[02:08:27.670 --> 02:08:32.890]
there's no shortage of space in the FM band yeah and I'm not going to do this digitalized thing

[02:08:32.890 --> 02:08:38.390]
which you I don't even understand yet so did you all know yeah anyway we'll come back for our

[02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:42.050]
big one to two are probably some folks will be coming in the building looking in the window which

[02:08:42.050 --> 02:08:46.690]
ought to be very exciting let's get some security in here for Tom the lovely the talented Elaine

[02:08:46.690 --> 02:08:51.590]
Etter is standing by with our one o'clock geriatric news no it's not the news it's geriatric it's

[02:08:51.590 --> 02:08:55.870]
Elaine's boyfriend Zimble come back at 105 Dick and Doug at two sports talks 605

[02:08:55.870 --> 02:09:05.430]
radio six can wio sure why not switch right 107 at the wio d Tom jik is here

[02:09:05.970 --> 02:09:11.450]
sudd was in studio everybody's happy says smiling got it along great how might do why can't we

[02:09:11.450 --> 02:09:16.570]
all get along yeah Rick oh he's always like that we have an open line on the star line at star

[02:09:16.570 --> 02:09:20.790]
iod for our bell soft mobility friends I'm just here to have a good time have a little lunch

[02:09:20.790 --> 02:09:28.050]
and go see mommy Jupiter yeah sir I have three quick thanks for you number one Tommy you were

[02:09:28.050 --> 02:09:34.030]
talking about advertisers don't buy and certainly two the numbers that they they're going for the

[02:09:34.030 --> 02:09:42.090]
demographic even though the number might be row yeah well depending on how low I mean you know

[02:09:42.090 --> 02:09:47.690]
yeah no bulk audience doesn't mean well but even so if you can't be off the can't be all that low

[02:09:47.690 --> 02:09:53.710]
if you got a 25 to 54 yeah you have a one but what I'm saying is like uh twin peaks does like a

[02:09:53.710 --> 02:09:59.610]
you know you drank like 70 second among the all shows in all households but demographically it's

[02:09:59.610 --> 02:10:03.470]
in the middle of the pack well then the syn nuts landing must do pretty well then too because they

[02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:07.350]
only like the last week they were 38th but you know that behind LA law yeah yeah yeah

[02:10:07.350 --> 02:10:14.330]
yeah the same time the same concept the piper radio to yeah pretty much okay okay number two

[02:10:14.330 --> 02:10:20.210]
couple weeks ago I had a radio accident I was listening to Mike Noir and he was talking about

[02:10:20.210 --> 02:10:28.930]
in books and he said we are the number one rated a radio station in the south east when you know

[02:10:28.930 --> 02:10:34.730]
what that means no no I'll tell you why he says that number one talk a m state and the reason

[02:10:34.730 --> 02:10:38.630]
for that is because they're talking to Palm Beach market and in that market they've got a big

[02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:43.290]
share right nothing else that pbr is virtually off the end yeah they've let go just about everybody

[02:10:43.290 --> 02:10:48.130]
I think they only have one live show a day I said yeah they died but everything is relevant I mean

[02:10:48.130 --> 02:10:52.670]
the number of people that it translates into is men's school because it's only Palm Beach County

[02:10:52.670 --> 02:10:55.570]
I mean if whole population of Palm Beach County is all about a half a million people yeah I'd be

[02:10:55.570 --> 02:10:59.570]
like it'd be like Jose Conceco coming down here and you know signing up at a softball league and

[02:10:59.570 --> 02:11:03.770]
hitting 800 that doesn't mean he's gonna hit 800 in the major leagues well I tell you they should

[02:11:03.770 --> 02:11:09.350]
do sell but yeah for a lot of daily area you know on their top of the RID you know just well they

[02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:13.890]
they've got a powerhouse combo them and rm f but they're they're not any factor in this market for

[02:11:13.890 --> 02:11:18.470]
example uh... the boy well about that they're looking at the book they get fractions in the day

[02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:22.930]
brow at books and they're not effective i.o.d does much better in Palm Beach than they do in

[02:11:22.930 --> 02:11:27.670]
Dayton brown as a matter of fact it matter of fact Monday through Sunday 12 plus in this last book

[02:11:27.670 --> 02:11:33.530]
they had a point five a two well I'll give you an example in the palm you know I do the Palm Beach

[02:11:33.930 --> 02:11:40.190]
ratings because uh... a lot of our readership is in Palm Beach and almost all the time four of

[02:11:40.190 --> 02:11:45.270]
the top ten stations in the Palm Beach market a day county stations I get people to appear you know

[02:11:45.270 --> 02:11:48.850]
somebody will say they were number four in the market well hell there's only six stations up here

[02:11:48.850 --> 02:11:53.870]
right well yeah it's about twelve but yeah most of them you can barely hear yeah okay uh final thing

[02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:59.530]
what uh... what they are going to be in here two thousand what's next well i think it's got to be

[02:11:59.530 --> 02:12:05.430]
pretty much what it is now a ban for for ethnic radio for uh... talk radio and for broken radio

[02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:11.270]
yeah broken radios you've got two stations in this market making a lot of money

[02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:18.630]
i mean i know i know the owner of k a t uh... i've known him for years he's a guy i talked to regularly

[02:12:18.630 --> 02:12:23.690]
on the phone how a premarine nil's not a friend of his but you know i i found him to be about he's

[02:12:23.690 --> 02:12:30.030]
a radio maven he knows what's going on uh... and you know all the stations and i i found his insights

[02:12:30.030 --> 02:12:34.690]
to be valuable and when i need you know what what this one's up to and what that that one's up to

[02:12:34.690 --> 02:12:39.630]
how it what that radio station because he always had to dream the program is on radio station

[02:12:39.630 --> 02:12:45.990]
yeah how it's father and law well yeah but yeah the point is he's you know it's his station and uh...

[02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:51.510]
but he found he's making so much money as a broken station that he just can't afford it maybe play radio

[02:12:52.170 --> 02:13:00.110]
nil yeah you know there's really truly just a handful of incredibly talented broadcasters in the

[02:13:00.110 --> 02:13:05.130]
country and and you truly want to thank you appreciate it but what he says is true without

[02:13:05.130 --> 02:13:10.330]
talking about me but there's so few people who are really creative and who are really entertaining

[02:13:10.330 --> 02:13:16.310]
and really whatever and whatever feel to happen to me and and i think now it is showing more

[02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:20.970]
than ever before now that a m is really desperate and people are well there's that new uh... talk to

[02:13:20.970 --> 02:13:26.110]
v network that's going to be coming on first quarter next year cable talk network and you look

[02:13:26.110 --> 02:13:30.190]

hello

[02:14:04.910 --> 02:14:05.270]
back

[02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.890]
yeah

[02:14:05.890 --> 02:14:07.270]
all that

[02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:08.430]
she is

[02:14:08.430 --> 02:14:12.090]
alan berk is going to be on overnight he's got like a two or three hours shift like from

[02:14:12.090 --> 02:14:16.750]
two in the morning till five in the morning in the east and midnight you know eleven to one in the west

[02:14:17.490 --> 02:14:22.510]
it's going to be simulcast all over the country uh... they they i and when you look at i said is this

[02:14:22.510 --> 02:14:23.690]
the best they can do

[02:14:24.370 --> 02:14:25.310]
you just wonder

[02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:28.410]
yeah well he sure i'd spend any money that's for sure

[02:14:28.410 --> 02:14:32.410]
twelve minutes out there he can miss that yeah well i probably uh... get his nose in there

[02:14:32.410 --> 02:14:37.170]
somewhere when you notice that big you anywhere twelve minutes after one at wio d and if you've

[02:14:37.170 --> 02:14:41.210]
heard us talk about it a lot of you probably have uh... kind of wondered about low jack does it make

[02:14:41.210 --> 02:14:46.150]
any sense does it work you can go out and spend thousands of dollars for an auto alarm system

[02:14:46.150 --> 02:14:47.650]
literally like two three grand

[02:14:47.650 --> 02:14:51.910]
and think you've got the greatest protection in the world the only problem is when somebody breaks into

[02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:57.090]
car in the alarm goes off number one nobody pays any attention and number two the experienced auto

[02:14:57.090 --> 02:15:00.850]
thief can disable the alarm in just a matter like seconds because they know where they install it they

[02:15:00.850 --> 02:15:04.930]
know how it's installed and so after a few seconds of beeping and hawking and nobody paying any more

[02:15:04.930 --> 02:15:12.330]
attention no more alarm and guess what no more car so i'll never see it again and boy uh... trying

[02:15:12.330 --> 02:15:16.270]
to collect on that auto reveal takes months and months with the insurance company and hassling

[02:15:16.270 --> 02:15:20.310]
and you'll ever get back what you have invested it's a nightmare so get yourself some realistic

[02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:25.470]
protection for your automobile or truck or van that you can afford low jack when you can do most

[02:15:25.470 --> 02:15:29.810]
new car dealerships now you'll see all the big signs they recommend it when i bought that last

[02:15:29.810 --> 02:15:33.630]

[02:16:16.850 --> 02:16:16.890]
idea

[02:16:16.890 --> 02:16:20.750]
it

[02:16:23.050 --> 02:16:24.490]
west

[02:16:24.490 --> 02:16:28.130]
izeigt

[02:16:28.290 --> 02:16:29.790]
ормill

[02:16:28.130 --> 02:16:30.130]
is no real no

[02:16:30.730 --> 02:16:33.390]
now it's like that side of the incident how desperate you are

[02:16:33.390 --> 02:16:34.830]
did you see why palis

[02:16:35.570 --> 02:16:35.890]
and what

[02:16:35.890 --> 02:16:38.030]
white palis the movie with scissors and

[02:16:38.910 --> 02:16:42.090]
now it's about like that you know that side views

[02:16:42.690 --> 02:16:45.770]
lot of rolling in he even but you never really get a clear on shot

[02:16:45.770 --> 02:16:48.650]
but i hate it don't worry about that madman rick riley

[02:16:48.650 --> 02:16:50.530]
biggest problem is

[02:16:50.530 --> 02:16:52.790]
has a poor relationship with father

[02:16:53.530 --> 02:16:54.870]
well i've got all that

[02:16:54.870 --> 02:17:00.670]
i think that's a great let's go to kendall

[02:17:00.670 --> 02:17:04.970]
uh... how i don't know how i'll be in another half hour

[02:17:04.970 --> 02:17:06.450]
the hell's it going great

[02:17:06.450 --> 02:17:09.310]
and i i i don't know if you are

[02:17:09.990 --> 02:17:13.650]
listen to dan rap is coming while you're here mind me about the

[02:17:13.650 --> 02:17:17.810]
that you know the state of america should think twice about dating iraq

[02:17:18.350 --> 02:17:20.150]
iraq why because he's not there anymore

[02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:24.050]
well you know i get to feel like this guy is like somewhat of a supporter of

[02:17:24.050 --> 02:17:24.650]
iraq

[02:17:25.330 --> 02:17:26.830]
i don't think that's true

[02:17:27.390 --> 02:17:30.210]
well i mean why would i think we should i think it's good advice to think

[02:17:30.210 --> 02:17:31.790]
twice before you invade anywhere

[02:17:31.790 --> 02:17:35.410]
i mean when you think of you think of the problems that we had in grenade

[02:17:35.410 --> 02:17:37.030]
or in panamau where they wanted us

[02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:40.310]
you know now we're going into a place where they got a military force of a

[02:17:40.310 --> 02:17:40.970]
million people

[02:17:40.970 --> 02:17:43.510]
and and i still when push comes to shove

[02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:47.350]
no offense but i don't trust all those other air of nations to really stand

[02:17:47.350 --> 02:17:48.110]
behind us

[02:17:48.110 --> 02:17:51.750]
i agree with you but i just thought that for for dan rather the state so to like

[02:17:51.750 --> 02:17:53.950]
that was kind of uh...

[02:17:53.950 --> 02:17:55.290]
one-sided situation

[02:17:55.290 --> 02:17:59.390]
i i think that's pretty good advice to think twice before you book on anything

[02:17:59.390 --> 02:18:00.190]
like that

[02:18:00.190 --> 02:18:04.490]
also rick rally and aliex been and had the same personality don't you think

[02:18:05.290 --> 02:18:08.190]
uh... i always thought aliex had a half way decent personality

[02:18:08.710 --> 02:18:11.550]
well you know he's doing the same things that uh...

[02:18:11.550 --> 02:18:14.990]
aliex did when uh... he said things about aliex and aliex would call him up on

[02:18:14.990 --> 02:18:16.750]
the phone so it's kind of uh...

[02:18:16.750 --> 02:18:17.310]
they have you

[02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:21.770]
only well only rick's got an audience yeah but it's not that you got to realize

[02:18:21.770 --> 02:18:22.650]
the show business

[02:18:23.170 --> 02:18:24.690]
okay guys thanks okay

[02:18:24.690 --> 02:18:27.970]
one eighteen and wio delets go to for water deal

[02:18:28.410 --> 02:18:29.870]
yes i know how you don't

[02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:33.230]
i was wondering i was watching the film in this morning and i'll get better

[02:18:33.230 --> 02:18:37.130]
the testing a new uh... hair product yeah i'm surprised iraq lambor was in

[02:18:37.130 --> 02:18:37.730]
on with him

[02:18:37.730 --> 02:18:41.490]
and he's going to be one of the guys are going to use it and then come on the show

[02:18:41.490 --> 02:18:43.530]
to see if it grew in the air and they showed a shot of

[02:18:43.530 --> 02:18:44.670]
his bald head

[02:18:44.670 --> 02:18:47.650]
and next week he's going to be able to read just they have a new product for a

[02:18:47.650 --> 02:18:48.650]
talent transplant

[02:18:48.650 --> 02:18:49.670]
to be great

[02:18:49.670 --> 02:18:50.850]
i want to talk about

[02:18:50.850 --> 02:18:54.070]
and only like to show evening shade is the uh...

[02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:58.750]
it's good as the amazing teddy b was which also make it

[02:18:58.750 --> 02:18:59.310]
uh... they did

[02:18:59.310 --> 02:19:02.930]
entirely different shows one was brought fast the other cell you know

[02:19:02.930 --> 02:19:05.410]
uh... i enjoyed both shows

[02:19:05.410 --> 02:19:06.770]
i like it yeah

[02:19:06.770 --> 02:19:08.830]
there's no show this year really blew me away

[02:19:09.350 --> 02:19:11.170]
i like pop rock and that's going into the toilet

[02:19:11.170 --> 02:19:12.790]
what do you think of wio you

[02:19:13.510 --> 02:19:13.910]
it's okay

[02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:15.370]
it's just okay

[02:19:15.370 --> 02:19:19.230]
uh... as far as demographics are i think that uh... another example of that

[02:19:19.230 --> 02:19:21.770]
would be uh... thirty something they get uh... not good

[02:19:21.770 --> 02:19:23.370]
right now that's the clearest example

[02:19:23.370 --> 02:19:24.870]
uh... last year

[02:19:26.390 --> 02:19:28.990]
or maybe was the year for a member writing about it the time

[02:19:29.550 --> 02:19:33.630]
the sixty minutes was not was the number four show overall television

[02:19:34.270 --> 02:19:36.810]
and uh... thirty something was number forty five

[02:19:37.510 --> 02:19:41.430]
but they got more money per per minute per commercial on thirty something

[02:19:41.430 --> 02:19:42.530]
they did on sixty minutes

[02:19:42.530 --> 02:19:46.210]
because sixty minutes again sixty minutes audience is all fifty five plus

[02:19:46.770 --> 02:19:50.230]
yeah it was it gets great yeah thirty something gets the ideal

[02:19:50.230 --> 02:19:50.810]
demographics

[02:19:50.810 --> 02:19:53.010]
that that that's probably the best example

[02:19:53.010 --> 02:19:56.070]
i just wanted to say that uh... that show on friday was incredible in the

[02:19:56.070 --> 02:19:58.030]
open with your after loan really

[02:19:58.550 --> 02:20:01.850]
that one about fifteen times when she came by and said we're all the black people

[02:20:01.850 --> 02:20:04.710]
that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that

[02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:06.510]
she really i just made it up

[02:20:06.510 --> 02:20:09.270]
because we were over across the street on the street getting ready with our

[02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:12.150]
up a session and i was just doing a little uh...

[02:20:12.150 --> 02:20:15.150]
fictitious play by plan it was funny and then closing it and and

[02:20:15.150 --> 02:20:17.530]
and i'm a great riley says anything clever it's nearly a coincidence

[02:20:17.530 --> 02:20:22.110]
have a great day okay well a little rick riley bashing that they are not taking

[02:20:22.110 --> 02:20:24.750]

[02:21:21.930 --> 02:21:22.450]
yes sir

[02:21:23.050 --> 02:21:24.870]
yeah i don't know it's interesting that uh...

[02:21:24.870 --> 02:21:27.590]
that you've been in this business long as you have any don't know anything

[02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:28.330]
yeah right

[02:21:28.330 --> 02:21:31.590]
yeah i have a feeling of learning all now yes sir a few minutes

[02:21:31.590 --> 02:21:35.570]
you know uh... i i'm kind of in fault that uh... you don't think anybody

[02:21:35.570 --> 02:21:38.970]
under fifty five years of age uh... uh... care that you think about this

[02:21:38.970 --> 02:21:39.790]
country

[02:21:39.790 --> 02:21:40.970]
when did i say that

[02:21:40.970 --> 02:21:42.790]
well that's uh... that's what you implied

[02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:47.410]
no i didn't say that i said that the kind of talk that we were doing before

[02:21:47.410 --> 02:21:50.310]
with the topics doesn't make it anymore that's what i said

[02:21:50.310 --> 02:21:53.770]
and if you go to air and if you go to all the research in every major market

[02:21:53.770 --> 02:21:54.770]
in every small market

[02:21:54.770 --> 02:21:58.470]
i guess they must all be stupid to so i don't you educate as i said a few

[02:21:58.470 --> 02:22:02.330]
minutes ago so that uh... sixty minutes it's primal audience is people fifty

[02:22:02.330 --> 02:22:04.850]
five and over that doesn't mean sixty minutes isn't a good program

[02:22:04.850 --> 02:22:07.750]
it doesn't mean there are some people under fifty five watching

[02:22:07.750 --> 02:22:10.630]
most of the numbers of people fifty five and over

[02:22:10.630 --> 02:22:14.350]
it seems to me like you know people uh... you should be doing like this

[02:22:14.350 --> 02:22:16.470]
already a station such a total waste

[02:22:16.470 --> 02:22:20.410]
what do i listen to it nothing here no then why do you listen to it

[02:22:20.410 --> 02:22:21.870]
what else is there

[02:22:21.870 --> 02:22:25.650]
but i'll come on come on what else is there but i really i was

[02:22:25.650 --> 02:22:27.970]
you can you can turn on you can turn on

[02:22:27.970 --> 02:22:30.530]
wait a minute wait a minute you have cable

[02:22:30.530 --> 02:22:33.770]
there's nothing here so you don't want to have a conversation all you want to

[02:22:33.770 --> 02:22:35.770]
is making a fault you have a do you have cable

[02:22:35.770 --> 02:22:37.590]
no i don't i don't even have a t-shirt

[02:22:38.910 --> 02:22:42.590]
also that you want to lay us on white one of the combat TV gets a cable

[02:22:42.590 --> 02:22:45.190]
watch the span and cnn and headline news

[02:22:45.190 --> 02:22:48.530]
one hour and hours and hours and hours all day long you can watch your

[02:22:48.530 --> 02:22:50.910]
government in action you can hear about what's going on in the world

[02:22:50.910 --> 02:22:54.510]
we can't be all things all this is a really unique i you know that

[02:22:54.510 --> 02:22:57.590]
the something like only one tenth of one percent of the people in this

[02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:59.710]
country dot of it all this is one of them

[02:22:59.710 --> 02:23:02.690]
no i don't have t-shirt there's nothing on there that the

[02:23:02.690 --> 02:23:05.550]
really interest me on your name yourself then you're an

[02:23:05.550 --> 02:23:08.130]
imbecile then you're telling me that the news isn't worth watching

[02:23:08.130 --> 02:23:12.270]
that nightline isn't worth watching that cnn isn't worth watching

[02:23:12.270 --> 02:23:16.550]
the piece of it when when may you get what mtv i said when i did have a

[02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:20.650]
television yeah and when i did have cable in a previous place where i was living

[02:23:20.650 --> 02:23:23.830]
yeah i did watch a great deal of c-band and cnn

[02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:25.410]
yeah so i don't have it now

[02:23:25.410 --> 02:23:27.350]
probably tell why don't you have it now

[02:23:27.350 --> 02:23:29.930]
well it's you know that's that's a personal

[02:23:30.410 --> 02:23:34.850]
question-living situation oh yeah so you can only afford to live a radio and you

[02:23:34.850 --> 02:23:37.990]
want us to you want us to get you want us to gear our gear

[02:23:37.990 --> 02:23:40.890]
live in a cardboard box under a bridge oh wait a minute you want us to gear

[02:23:40.890 --> 02:23:43.550]
our ter radio station to you the hell with the audience the hell with

[02:23:43.550 --> 02:23:46.390]
anything else we're supposed to entertain you right or inform you

[02:23:46.390 --> 02:23:51.110]
the wall i think that your type of program is okay to a certain extent but you

[02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:55.030]
spend a great deal of time you know i think there could be a nice mixture

[02:23:55.750 --> 02:23:58.710]
i'm but you know something i'm not interested in what you think because i've

[02:23:58.710 --> 02:24:02.450]
been in the business for 30 years and quite contrary to what you say i have great

[02:24:02.450 --> 02:24:05.450]
ratings and i'm making a lot of money and i'm very successful and i didn't

[02:24:05.450 --> 02:24:09.870]
consult with you first okay but you're entitled you're entitled to your opinion but i'm not

[02:24:09.870 --> 02:24:13.590]
interested in you got lazy and you just don't want to do the work to put a

[02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:18.430]
topical talk show no i know that's got nothing to do with it the fact is that it's boring okay it

[02:24:18.430 --> 02:24:21.770]
was boring to me and the fact that w-n-w-s just went off the air within their

[02:24:21.770 --> 02:24:25.810]
plane now the 1940s music has to tell you something doesn't it sir let's get that's

[02:24:25.810 --> 02:24:31.090]
get to w-n-w-s okay rest in peace all right w-n-w-s or did you

[02:24:31.090 --> 02:24:36.290]
did you listen to that when it was on uh yeah i did yeah i didn't like that much either yeah

[02:24:36.290 --> 02:24:40.730]
what do you like here what is it that what is it that you do like they didn't have any talent

[02:24:41.770 --> 02:24:47.390]
uh now get a w-n-w-s talent who would you say is talent what they did was a very positive move

[02:24:48.570 --> 02:24:54.390]
because what they had to do uh you say the snow the brain damage snowbirds are coming down

[02:24:54.390 --> 02:24:58.950]
yeah here when it comes to brain damage we finally got to an area you have some expertise in

[02:24:58.950 --> 02:25:04.530]

[02:25:17.790 --> 02:25:24.370]
well yeah but you were very good you know that's what i used to be good well they're not bad now now

[02:25:24.370 --> 02:25:30.450]
uh but um i was gonna ask Tom and i was listen to when you said discussing

[02:25:31.170 --> 02:25:38.490]
avoid these talk shows of failing and are you know in the wrong country are they really trying

[02:25:38.490 --> 02:25:44.930]
to get rid of mostly talk shows nobody is get trying to get rid of any radio station owner in

[02:25:44.930 --> 02:25:50.730]
America would put anything on the air that worked talk shows are not working now people have

[02:25:50.730 --> 02:25:55.270]
burned out on the topics there's only a few topics and as Neil said there's only a few guests

[02:25:55.270 --> 02:26:00.610]
who can articulate them very well they all have the same people they recycle them you can't sit day

[02:26:00.610 --> 02:26:06.870]
in day out hour in hour out listening to the same all stuff do you think that there's anything in

[02:26:06.870 --> 02:26:12.090]
the world that can be said new on the topic of a blusher anything that could be said new in the

[02:26:12.090 --> 02:26:16.770]
topic of gun control anything that could be said new on what the United States should do in the

[02:26:16.770 --> 02:26:21.650]
Middle East are capital punishment yeah and meanwhile that's versus the right and then that's

[02:26:21.650 --> 02:26:29.110]
what these programs trying to do yeah but at time some of these people like Neil and uh you know

[02:26:29.110 --> 02:26:40.730]
Jerry I've been in a business 30 and 35 years and now WMW MRZ still have them so I mean you know uh

[02:26:40.730 --> 02:26:48.410]
still has what 30 30 years experience what does that mean well I think the paper of experience

[02:26:48.410 --> 02:26:55.250]
show a lot in the business okay have a wonderful day 131 we had a perfected their

[02:26:55.250 --> 02:27:00.810]
Pembroke Pines hi Neil yes sir hey and nobody congratulated you on yesterday showing for a

[02:27:00.810 --> 02:27:05.690]
Monday that was on the wow we're still writing the time from Friday I think the audience is on a

[02:27:05.690 --> 02:27:11.730]
roller coaster I think maybe that's it I got something I wanted to direct something at time I

[02:27:12.250 --> 02:27:16.090]
he made a statement in the first hour you know he said how many you know you were talking about

[02:27:16.090 --> 02:27:21.290]
the racing and how they had you know people would go back just to see you know a horror accident or

[02:27:21.290 --> 02:27:26.530]
or a car at Indie how many go to see just the crash do you think that doesn't that come to play in

[02:27:26.530 --> 02:27:30.350]
in the recent events with the hockey do you think a lot of people wanted that hockey game to see

[02:27:30.350 --> 02:27:35.190]
the fight and not so much I was a small part of it that might happen during the game I don't think

[02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:39.910]
this I don't not the game that we had here I mean it just was a happening it was a one maybe once

[02:27:39.910 --> 02:27:44.090]
in a lifetime thing because right now the thing looks pretty shaky I don't know what nobody's

[02:27:44.090 --> 02:27:48.250]
behind it to for permanency but yet I think a lot of people might have went down there because

[02:27:48.310 --> 02:27:53.190]
they wanted to see everybody do it out no I think a lot of people go to hockey games to see that

[02:27:53.190 --> 02:27:57.850]
in general but I don't think that particular game is a good example okay I got one question I

[02:27:57.850 --> 02:28:02.450]
want to aim at talent I'm I think people go to hockey games in Toronto now it hopes that we might

[02:28:02.450 --> 02:28:06.510]
win another game this season but I wouldn't I wouldn't know of my breath well I'm an islander fan

[02:28:06.510 --> 02:28:11.190]
well I am that you can relate to yeah right I'll tell you it might not be the worst thing in the

[02:28:11.190 --> 02:28:16.590]
world supposedly there is another Wayne Gretzky the first draft choice this coming year oh that's

[02:28:16.590 --> 02:28:21.690]
right Toronto traded it though to Jersey they don't have a draft choice okay okay really the next

[02:28:21.690 --> 02:28:26.110]
Wayne Gretzky supposedly coming out this year what I got one question I'm not I'm not one of those

[02:28:26.110 --> 02:28:31.470]
one tenth of one percent of don't own a TV however I probably watch a TV less than two hours a week

[02:28:31.470 --> 02:28:37.270]
and that's basically because I work midnight and I stay up like during the day when I get home

[02:28:37.270 --> 02:28:41.670]
in the morning too I listen to Neil and I'm home I'm up to about three then I sleep from like three

[02:28:41.670 --> 02:28:45.970]
to nine I don't you watch the news ever a football game maybe some football on a Sunday

[02:28:45.970 --> 02:28:51.850]
you know maybe a one game would be more than two hours a week but anyway I watch very little TV

[02:28:51.850 --> 02:28:56.910]
and there was a show on years ago that I don't understand why they took it off and the network

[02:28:56.910 --> 02:29:02.290]
would never answer to why they took it off they just said it was you know this is to take it off

[02:29:02.290 --> 02:29:07.910]
and it was very popular it was called the days and nights of Molly Dodd can you tell me what why

[02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:15.410]
they the day time cable network now and they're canceling it well why it was so popular back then it

[02:29:15.410 --> 02:29:20.650]
heard it in her it like a thirty five share from she is and took it down to about an eighteen

[02:29:20.650 --> 02:29:25.710]
share and then the L.A. law would come on and it will go back up to a thirty share that's pretty

[02:29:25.710 --> 02:29:32.030]
clear rejection okay well I guess I was you know I don't get me wrong I'm making a quantitative

[02:29:32.030 --> 02:29:36.790]
judgment I thought Molly Dodd was terrific too I thought it was great I don't know I don't

[02:29:36.790 --> 02:29:41.630]
mean yet ratings but I understood from the reading the papers and like people magazine and stuff

[02:29:41.630 --> 02:29:46.250]
after they took it off the they would leave you to believe that they they couldn't understand it

[02:29:46.250 --> 02:29:51.090]
either because the show had high ratings it didn't have high ratings you never read that anywhere

[02:29:51.090 --> 02:29:56.750]
oh yes sir and reasons is because of the fact that she was an attractive woman and she attracted

[02:29:56.750 --> 02:30:03.330]
a you know she had a large male backing audience now that's that's what well he died never had

[02:30:03.330 --> 02:30:07.510]
a large audience and you never read anybody you knew anything about television say that

[02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:12.530]
okay well I just was curious about why that show I probably said it was a good show but they

[02:30:12.530 --> 02:30:17.510]
never said it was a high rated show okay Tom and it's on it's still on lifetime yeah well I

[02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:22.390]
guess I don't get I don't even I barely get three channels here and I don't turn them on 99%

[02:30:22.390 --> 02:30:26.530]
of the time anyway okay well thanks a lot for answering my question okay one thirty four on

[02:30:26.530 --> 02:30:31.270]
all intellect radio six ten WI the intellectual we gotta give you a little bit of that in because

[02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:35.230]
people are have avoidant their lives we have an open line and brownered five two four that works

[02:30:35.230 --> 02:30:41.370]
five times Jesus it looked like a minute where I just had a guy I was a guy I hope not

[02:30:41.370 --> 02:30:45.950]
no why would he be on financial it wasn't Roy but it looked just like he don't say that Roy's

[02:30:45.950 --> 02:30:50.530]
good but I don't want to look at him he just did something about him twenty six till two at WIOD

[02:30:50.530 --> 02:30:59.830]
and we'll be right back twenty two till two our new neutral system post-u-child Johnny darkis

[02:30:59.830 --> 02:31:03.810]
in the building looking slim and trim and still got the same idiotic shirt on from came

[02:31:03.810 --> 02:31:09.550]
arpeggio looks great let's go to bokeh hey Neil yes sir I'd have Tom a couple questions

[02:31:09.550 --> 02:31:16.410]
shoot Tom how long have you been listening Neil Rogers me yeah I listen to you on KAT how long

[02:31:16.410 --> 02:31:23.350]
goes that okay long enough I meet two wasn't a great way to do topics yes it was fantastic and

[02:31:23.350 --> 02:31:27.870]
and he's good doing this and now now I know to someone walking around the hallway gonna go say

[02:31:27.870 --> 02:31:32.150]
he's sucking up to Neil but I got a couple of I may know you know I've been a fan of his for years

[02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:38.330]
yeah so what do you what do you think's gonna happen to Rick Riley's numbers when Steve can get

[02:31:38.330 --> 02:31:42.430]
back on the air I don't think that Steve will have that great an impact they're really know that's

[02:31:42.430 --> 02:31:47.550]
a it's a station that only has a signal in Browell County I think Steve will have an impact in Browell

[02:31:47.550 --> 02:31:54.790]
it not the same audience yeah he'll get yeah I think they're they're what they're doing now

[02:31:55.550 --> 02:32:03.430]
primarily appeals to the lower end of the 18 to 34 demographic I think Steve plays a little bit

[02:32:03.430 --> 02:32:08.530]
older than that I would say if you asked me the average age of of their audience I would say it's

[02:32:08.530 --> 02:32:15.030]
about 22 23 yeah serious I would I'm not I'm not trying to be a smart at here and I want to label

[02:32:15.030 --> 02:32:19.050]
this clearly as my opinion because I know someone's gonna come in and probably come up with all

[02:32:19.050 --> 02:32:23.170]
of sorts and that's my opinion I would say 22 you listen to the people who call into the show

[02:32:23.170 --> 02:32:30.250]
that's how I judge I would say can you do audiences probably closer to the 35 to 40 bracket well I

[02:32:30.250 --> 02:32:37.750]
do listen to Rick and such show on occasion but you know what it is very I know you're not gonna

[02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:43.270]
agree but it is very close to what you do because again it's just another fun show and you're when

[02:32:43.270 --> 02:32:49.110]
you do it it's like you pick you know you pick through the day for that and then here comes

[02:32:49.570 --> 02:32:54.410]
and you're kind of tune in around trying to find something something else because let's face it

[02:32:54.410 --> 02:32:59.690]
since we've been listening to you for so long we like to have a little issue or a little topic

[02:32:59.690 --> 02:33:04.250]
well I you know I am going to disagree because first of all afternoon drive jury Williams proved

[02:33:04.250 --> 02:33:09.710]
that years ago and he didn't do you know bananas split in your pants but he did mostly humor in the

[02:33:09.710 --> 02:33:13.690]
afternoon here's a guy's been doing heavy duty topics and and has gone back to doing in a Boston

[02:33:13.690 --> 02:33:19.550]
for like 35 years now but when he was down here he learned very fast he said in the afternoon

[02:33:19.550 --> 02:33:23.990]
and the traffic and the heat down here the last thing people want to hear is screaming and yelling

[02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:29.070]
in afternoon drive and he was absolutely right he had a five six in the afternoon his last book here

[02:33:29.070 --> 02:33:33.690]
and an afternoon drive that is an enormous number it's incredible I remember used to come in

[02:33:33.690 --> 02:33:37.690]
some days and go I don't think I'm gonna talk to anybody today yeah talk before I was he'd be

[02:33:37.690 --> 02:33:44.150]
anticipating you know what I do think that when teen was back on there after you kneel it was

[02:33:44.150 --> 02:33:50.690]
a well-rounded show a well-rounded whole IOD was really well-rounded I was one of the guys that

[02:33:50.690 --> 02:33:56.730]
was bashing came but that's free left you know where else to go and then you brought in Bennett

[02:33:56.730 --> 02:34:03.110]
and then it was like from two o'clock I'm like radio but I just wanted to you know figure out

[02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:07.790]
what Tom thought about what's gonna happen is radio that thing they're gonna get hit a lot harder

[02:34:07.790 --> 02:34:13.750]
than you guys say well you just don't understand the nature of that radio station the signal is only

[02:34:13.750 --> 02:34:18.170]
in Broward County I mean you know maybe if you're on a hundred and eighty third street you might be

[02:34:18.170 --> 02:34:22.570]
able to hear it but for the most part it's a Broward there's another thing you're missing too and

[02:34:22.570 --> 02:34:26.850]
that is that you know what a lot of management people don't understand is you have the ability to

[02:34:26.850 --> 02:34:35.450]
expand the audience now when I went on in mid days on w i n z sandy and l were on n w s in this

[02:34:35.450 --> 02:34:42.430]
station in mid day and between them they had about a six share okay six and a half three five three

[02:34:42.430 --> 02:34:49.150]
two whatever in the spring book of that year I had a nine share al had a two seven sandy I think

[02:34:49.150 --> 02:34:53.190]
had like a two five or whatever but if you add that up that means like fourteen or fifteen

[02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:57.290]
percent of the audience we're listening to talk in midday as opposed to six and a half percent

[02:34:57.290 --> 02:35:01.210]
that we're listening before so it's not that you're always choosing from the they're dividing up

[02:35:01.210 --> 02:35:05.930]
the same pie if you put different things on it attract a different audience you expand the

[02:35:05.930 --> 02:35:10.190]
universe yeah like during during the world series is a good example the networks now a down to

[02:35:10.190 --> 02:35:14.630]
about sixty six percent of the viewing audience in any given time they used to have ninety percent

[02:35:14.630 --> 02:35:19.430]
but when the world series is on it is a major mini series or even a couple of good tv movies on a

[02:35:19.430 --> 02:35:23.790]
Sunday night the network share of the pie goes up to say eighty eighty five percent sometimes again

[02:35:23.790 --> 02:35:29.690]
so yeah so why couldn't Steve get a job at a different radio station that because we're right to you

[02:35:29.690 --> 02:35:33.390]
well yeah but where where where who's gonna harm yeah sure there's nobody doing talk

[02:35:33.390 --> 02:35:38.370]
this is like you guys do but with space and he not only does he have a good folly he had decent

[02:35:38.370 --> 02:35:43.010]
numbers no but but wait a minute wait a minute once you don't understand is nobody is doing talk

[02:35:43.010 --> 02:35:48.350]
with the last serious talk station just went off the years you know a few days ago who's gonna

[02:35:48.350 --> 02:35:52.890]
hire him he talked to QA and they already just changed format a few months ago are they gonna go

[02:35:52.890 --> 02:35:58.230]
out and hire an entire talkstance so they can put Steve on a year no and the thing with FTL again

[02:35:58.230 --> 02:36:02.730]
they're playing big bands his show on there is so in congress it's it's it's a way it could be one

[02:36:02.730 --> 02:36:07.130]
of a kind in the country but the fact is they're so desperate for money that they're willing to

[02:36:07.130 --> 02:36:11.930]
to prostitute the airwaves to put him on when it's gonna be their benefit and to his because he

[02:36:11.930 --> 02:36:16.030]
needs the job he needs the money and he's gonna do great over there compared to what they've been

[02:36:16.030 --> 02:36:20.970]
doing they got a point eight mid-day in the summer and summer book it's like K18 now you know

[02:36:20.970 --> 02:36:25.170]
the broke it station one how you have a guy doing a program in Haitian the next how you have it

[02:36:25.170 --> 02:36:29.310]
doing in Spanish I mean it's two different audience in addition to which and I said this when I

[02:36:29.310 --> 02:36:34.250]
was on Zade in the morning I said it even before then the FM programmers in this market are so

[02:36:34.250 --> 02:36:38.910]
stupid if somebody had a brain which they don't they would put talk on FM in this market which they

[02:36:38.910 --> 02:36:43.850]
been doing in Philly for years with WWWDB they'd have that younger demographic already locked in

[02:36:43.850 --> 02:36:48.550]
there most of whom already are on the FM band they could kick ass in this market with an FM talk

[02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:52.690]
station we proved that it's Zade in the morning and the people in this market are too stupid that's

[02:36:52.690 --> 02:36:56.910]
why you got love 94 where they're jazz and you got a lot of these other mark like Waxi over there

[02:36:56.910 --> 02:37:01.230]
continuing to try to bang their heads the coast is beating up on them destroying them and it still

[02:37:01.230 --> 02:37:06.590]
keep trying to they're doing the same thing the sub-destructed just like WNWS was doing that WCAU

[02:37:06.590 --> 02:37:09.990]
and Philly they'll be used to be a giant and talk they just dumped out of it they're doing all

[02:37:09.990 --> 02:37:18.390]
like QIS anything anything anything possible I mean I remember when comedy was dead on television six

[02:37:18.390 --> 02:37:23.170]
seven years ago then Cos became a long and that drama's dead you know everything moves inside

[02:37:23.170 --> 02:37:27.490]
if I could tell you what was going to work five years and now I'd be making his $1 a year as a

[02:37:27.490 --> 02:37:34.550]
consultant like Neil yeah right and a great day very Sullivan yeah sure markets down 12 points

[02:37:34.550 --> 02:37:42.010]
let's go to Miramar hello yes sir Tom yeah what do you think of the radio banded on

[02:37:42.010 --> 02:37:50.830]
on ocean he sends me tapes unsolicited and I get I just got a tape the other day from I'm with

[02:37:50.830 --> 02:37:58.430]
a note saying this is the last one I'm sending if you don't review me and I I don't find them all

[02:37:58.430 --> 02:38:03.330]
that funny I think the American comedy now he's got some clever stuff but just because he sends

[02:38:03.330 --> 02:38:07.370]
me tapes doesn't mean that I'm not a review I can't think of a reason to review on how many people

[02:38:07.370 --> 02:38:14.950]
you suppose the listening to that show okay oh of course it was him that's why I was just

[02:38:14.950 --> 02:38:19.870]
awaiting from neither a say something or choke did it which I think it ain't Goldberg so anyway in

[02:38:19.870 --> 02:38:25.190]
the last year if you were buying WFPL in the afternoon you can get off for about $40 a spot yeah

[02:38:26.310 --> 02:38:31.830]
so I have to say no Steve's getting a hundred he says I don't meant I don't I didn't know he was

[02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:37.190]
going about 40 dollars a spot I heard somebody about the rates I just said I clarified no that's

[02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:43.010]
Steve Steve's guy is old all sponsors and he thinks he you know he says he's getting a hundred oh

[02:38:43.010 --> 02:38:49.070]
well that's a hundred yeah he said he he said he was getting about 200 here so he's telling him

[02:38:49.070 --> 02:38:55.890]
that getting Steve came for half price it's 2500 spots what do you mean at 40 dollars a pop

[02:38:57.530 --> 02:39:01.710]
well I know what he mean no he says he's get no not that he's making a hundred grand he's

[02:39:01.710 --> 02:39:09.250]
charging a hundred dollars per spot that's what he says yeah okay but I'm just telling you what he says

[02:39:09.250 --> 02:39:17.430]
I'm just telling you what the what the economics are well you know it strikes me it's certainly never

[02:39:17.430 --> 02:39:22.090]
been tried to a story like that you're gonna check with a couple agencies because you know they do

[02:39:22.090 --> 02:39:27.390]
that on national media stories about projecting shows and things like that they go to agency media

[02:39:27.390 --> 02:39:32.230]
directors and find out what the markets play with Steve Steve is not going out in the street really

[02:39:32.230 --> 02:39:36.950]
he's going to all the people that he used to have here and this you know there's almost like a

[02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:42.970]
relationship there and maybe if he if he gets the hundred now I'm sure whether he continues to

[02:39:42.970 --> 02:39:48.850]
get it will depend on what kind of traffic he said it was a tragedy Saturday oh god I cried I

[02:39:48.850 --> 02:39:53.610]
said you know it was just awful I was in the year with favorite place watching it oh yeah sports

[02:39:53.610 --> 02:40:01.670]
book oh no kid which one I was at the hill how they react out there a lot of disgust and you know

[02:40:02.570 --> 02:40:06.770]
unhappiness people didn't leave they just moved over watch football games and bet on those instead

[02:40:06.770 --> 02:40:11.710]
yeah that's how it was you know I was I was at Belmont and there was some people who got up and left

[02:40:11.710 --> 02:40:16.370]
yeah oh yeah a lot of years in their eyes I mean it was it was a legitimate emotion it was

[02:40:16.370 --> 02:40:21.150]
because that was the race that was everyone was looking for and and and and it was a firm

[02:40:21.150 --> 02:40:30.990]
then Aledar all over again until that happened you know high-neil yes I heard axel on Sunday on ESPN

[02:40:30.990 --> 02:40:36.710]
and he made the comment that they had that the usual complainers hadn't complained about the track

[02:40:36.710 --> 02:40:41.330]
condition there and of course that we know people like Jolly want now yeah who normally are the

[02:40:41.530 --> 02:40:46.690]
first ones the moan if things aren't right and they and in fact some of them thought that the track

[02:40:46.690 --> 02:40:52.910]
condition was pretty good so I guess that's a question that really goes well you know go from one

[02:40:52.910 --> 02:40:56.890]
in my mind broke down because she was trying to lie the other horse took a hot attack right third

[02:40:56.890 --> 02:41:00.530]
horse tripped over the horse and took the hot attack and of all people to be complaining a lot

[02:41:00.530 --> 02:41:05.410]
it's Wayne Luke yeah who has probably broken down more horses than any race track on earth yeah

[02:41:05.410 --> 02:41:09.370]
but now he can go back to his own as a blame on the track right I mean you know Wayne has always

[02:41:09.370 --> 02:41:15.190]
been a better salesman than he has been a horseman yeah so I'm doing great yeah Saturday where

[02:41:15.190 --> 02:41:20.630]

[02:44:19.010 --> 02:44:23.530]
I'm not a great fan of the ocean but I have to say one thing at least Neil's the only one in this town

[02:44:23.910 --> 02:44:28.830]
that says something about Rick Weaver and I wanted to ask your guest what's the way back come out with it

[02:44:28.830 --> 02:44:35.090]
with an article on this scene our guy we have to listen to this guy scream people on on on the broadcast

[02:44:36.130 --> 02:44:42.330]
you know he's no hairy carry he's gone by his time well I'll tell you what I'm not I did actually

[02:44:42.330 --> 02:44:46.470]
I did a piece on Rick Weaver I did when I was at the Miami News I did a TV book cover story on him

[02:44:46.470 --> 02:44:50.990]
before one football season and it was a very fragile piece matter fact he sent me a note

[02:44:50.990 --> 02:44:59.390]
thank him before it and then right after that he got mad at me for some reason and we've never

[02:44:59.390 --> 02:45:03.190]
spoken again I don't know why I'm you know maybe you know maybe you know maybe he's a friend of

[02:45:03.190 --> 02:45:10.370]
ricks maybe he'll think maybe he'll know yeah at Robbie's kid on the year well he deserves it kind

[02:45:10.370 --> 02:45:15.270]
of broadcast and the jerk like this I mean come on well I say come out of what you missed your jerk

[02:45:15.270 --> 02:45:19.410]
to use no matter what you think of weaver and I told you that you know I personally I'm not that

[02:45:19.410 --> 02:45:24.470]
big a fan of his he does a good play by playing I'll give you a good example yeah two weeks ago in

[02:45:24.470 --> 02:45:28.630]
the dolphins were playing up at the Thursday night game the only way I could get it on the satellite

[02:45:28.630 --> 02:45:34.570]
was on the Mexican satellite and there's a slight delay about a one second delay and so I put IOD

[02:45:34.570 --> 02:45:38.770]
on the listen to the sound because I don't speak you know no no speak at his Spanish so Rick

[02:45:38.770 --> 02:45:43.590]
Rick was actually calling the play so quick that he was beating the one second delay and I knew

[02:45:43.590 --> 02:45:49.050]
what was going to happen before I saw it he does call a good game forget all the other business

[02:45:49.050 --> 02:45:53.210]
he calls a good game well you never sat in the stadium and watched the player because he's not

[02:45:53.210 --> 02:45:58.630]
calling for you people that are not even on the field well then you have you have something you

[02:45:58.630 --> 02:46:02.350]
saw something like if you're going to cut a guy like like the guy in the afternoon here who's done

[02:46:02.350 --> 02:46:06.390]
doing a show which I think it's good I didn't cut the guy in the afternoon why do we gonna get

[02:46:06.390 --> 02:46:11.830]
that straight you know what this issue is not about me cutting him the issue is that I didn't say

[02:46:11.830 --> 02:46:16.390]
was God Linda Thornton once said he was mildly amusing and he ripped the hell out of hub because that

[02:46:16.390 --> 02:46:21.130]
wasn't enough for him well I think he's very amusing I think he's a good I'm sure well why do you

[02:46:21.130 --> 02:46:25.950]
can listen to Steve King cut the whole roll down well that'll be my first choice yeah yeah

[02:46:25.950 --> 02:46:31.070]
well that that these guys like to each other be boring but wouldn't it thank you okay

[02:46:31.590 --> 02:46:35.510]
and no company say about a guy who likes Rick Riley and doesn't like Rick Weaver

[02:46:37.870 --> 02:46:43.730]
one fifty six at W.I.O.D. here's a mobile in West Palm Beach yeah hello yes sir two quick

[02:46:43.730 --> 02:46:48.950]
comments on the question one I think Neil has probably got the most amazing sense of radio he

[02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:56.070]
knows when it changed the show and that for that two recon says now we thought that one of the

[02:46:56.070 --> 02:47:00.210]
the best things they do is a lot of their humor is visual and they're doing it over the radio it's

[02:47:00.210 --> 02:47:05.050]
like David Letterman kind of like when he used to put the channel 10 news on WNWS yeah well

[02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:09.950]
it's both better the question I had for you was you keep talking about issue oriented talk being

[02:47:09.950 --> 02:47:14.910]
dead there's a guy up here I know he goes down into at least a decimal date Jack Cole who does a

[02:47:14.910 --> 02:47:20.390]
kind of strange show issue oriented I wonder what you thought of him I don't I've heard his show

[02:47:20.390 --> 02:47:25.570]
from time to time I've even been a guest on it I'm not a big fan of it I always I always thought

[02:47:25.570 --> 02:47:30.070]
at least it gave a different angle to the to the issue stuff it wasn't as serious I mean issue

[02:47:30.070 --> 02:47:35.290]
talk isn't dead everywhere it's there are some places where it works but it doesn't work the

[02:47:35.290 --> 02:47:41.530]
way it used to work here yeah I mean like in California W ABC has what they consider issue talk

[02:47:42.150 --> 02:47:46.450]
it's it's so saccharine in bland no you can't listen but you know what they'll tip off in this

[02:47:46.450 --> 02:47:50.970]
market is I was just thinking about what the caller saying about up there the tip off in the Miami

[02:47:50.970 --> 02:47:56.750]
Fort Lauderdale market is with the gigantic older audience that we have here and they still even

[02:47:56.750 --> 02:48:01.210]
in 12 plus which includes up to the age of 300 they still don't have a big number so when you

[02:48:01.210 --> 02:48:05.550]
consider the fact that you know we do have that bizarre demographic that's old and they still

[02:48:05.550 --> 02:48:10.390]
weren't cutting it it's history boy it's uh well yeah you have the older and then you have 40%

[02:48:10.390 --> 02:48:15.030]
of the market and no secret right and I mean it this is really one of the strangest markets in the

[02:48:15.030 --> 02:48:20.170]
country because in the other markets where you have large Hispanic populations New York LA and

[02:48:20.170 --> 02:48:24.850]
some of the place in Texas the Hispanics aren't as wed to their language they're all trying to

[02:48:24.850 --> 02:48:28.950]
learn English where in this market you can do very well without ever speaking the word of English

[02:48:29.510 --> 02:48:34.090]
and a lot of people do and they listen to those radio stations there are more successful Spanish

[02:48:34.090 --> 02:48:38.190]
language radio stations here than anywhere else I don't I don't think New York has more than one or

[02:48:38.190 --> 02:48:43.030]
two stations and they're insignificant and and probably in terms of people they're probably

[02:48:43.030 --> 02:48:47.690]
more exciting than New York yeah yeah you just don't hear it but yet here because the Cuban

[02:48:47.690 --> 02:48:51.650]
population is kind of built in insular culture they do very very well.

[02:48:52.910 --> 02:48:57.550]
Neil thanks a lot okay the mighty show was one of the best thanks thanks okay we're just about

[02:48:57.550 --> 02:49:02.550]
