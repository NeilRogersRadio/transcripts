[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.700]
Yeah I just want to ask you a question about a band called Camillean Church if you heard of them.

[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.260]

[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.860]

No.

[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.220]
That was it sir.

[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.180]
Okay thank you.

[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.080]
So we can cover and put their experts on that stuff one open line in date county 751 W.Y.O.D. one in brown or W.Y.O.D.

[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.220]
Hello.

[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.360]
What is that chronic idea?

[00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.980]
Okay thank you so much.

[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.740]
I would agree with that.

[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.260]
What is just out of control and just pathetic.

[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.820]
Let's see did Mark tree for man figuring some stuff out here you know because our programming department can't figure this stuff out.

[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.380]
Let's go to four lotterdale W.Y.O.D.

[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.460]
Yeah the the brown chair is out there opposing his record store.

[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.120]
Yeah.

[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.240]
The sound like copies of two I crew that was right.

[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.520]
Well I got to raise some money you know.

[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.640]
Time's good.

[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.580]
Listen I got a good idea you want to know how they could straighten out radio stations.

[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.900]
It could open up radio stations.

[00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.080]
Yeah.

[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.180]
Open up a station called W.Y.O.U.

[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.800]
Yeah.

[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.060]
Meaning that.

[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.980]
Well very keen.

[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.540]
Very keen.

[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.740]
Very keen started one called W.I.O.U.

[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.200]
I was going to say that next but you took the words right out of my shoes.

[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.240]
But anyway you know you have people coming in and they request their songs for a day and you're like winners.

[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.040]
For a day you can enter a contest.

[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.620]
Yeah.

[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.880]
And then when you win you go in.

[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.860]
But if you don't like the idea then forget about it.

[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.980]
I know what I'm gonna forget about it.

[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.880]
I know what I'm gonna forget about it.

[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.200]
I know what I'm gonna forget about it.

[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.680]
I know what I'm gonna forget about it.

[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.540]
Okay Tim that was Tim William was a little distraught that jaded and picked up those DTR listeners.

[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.640]
Okay you'll be okay Tim.

[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.920]
20 so new in a W.Y.O.D.

[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.620]
We have an open line in Dade, one in Brown, one in Palm Beach.

[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.820]
I feel like we're sitting here for something they like the numbers.

[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.940]
Let's go to Volka and there's nobody there.

[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.160]
I don't think anybody there wants to do that.

[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.740]
That Volka line.

[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.520]
I don't think so.

[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.180]
If my recent memory remembers W.Y.O.D.

[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.220]
Yes, Laura, please.

[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.300]
Who is it?

[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.980]
Laura?

[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.660]
Laura?

[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.040]
Yes.

[00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.200]
Laura's long trip.

[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.120]
W.Y.O.D.

[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.020]
Okay let's try Fort Lauderdale.

[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.340]
Hello.

[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.880]
Hey Neil how are you?

[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.080]
Okay how are you?

[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.640]
Well I got a phone to pick.

[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.080]
Everybody in this damn office makes a fun of me for listening to you and calling you all the time.

[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.320]
And I think they're all a bunch of douchebags.

[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.920]
What do you think?

[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.400]
My mom would come to me.

[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.460]
What do you want sir?

[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.980]
What do you want?

[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.460]
I'm gonna put on you trying to put on a show to impress your friends sitting there.

[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.320]
Is that what it's all about?

[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.740]
No.

[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.380]
Well what the hell do you want?

[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.400]
Talk intelligent.

[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.360]
Talk some issues.

[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.560]
Talk something meaningful.

[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.360]
Issues.

[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.520]
Like capital punishment.

[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.180]
Why?

[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.880]
For people who make calls like this.

[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.420]
Why?

[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.640]
Because that's what this show is all about.

[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.900]
It has some substance.

[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.300]
I like it better with the fun show like you know.

[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.000]
No sir.

[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.840]
Well the fun ended.

[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.120]
The minute we punched up your call W.Y.O.D.

[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.580]
Hold on a minute.

[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.600]
That was Randy.

[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.160]
She's practicing W.Y.O.D.

[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.200]
What is it?

[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.820]
Right.

[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.320]

[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.980]
Right.

[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.000]
Brian.

[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.240]

[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.660]
Yes.

[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.980]
What do you want Brian?

[00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.920]
Brian.

[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.760]
You son?

[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.340]
Okay 1142 at W.Y.O.D.

[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.220]
And speaking of that time to talk about Charod right now, they're waiting to serve you a fantastic fresh lunch right now.

[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.460]
And now for those of you watching your weight like FedRick, well, all what people around the country.

[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.100]
Okay.

[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.100]
We've got all these ridiculously bad numbers.

[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:25.200]
We have a depressing day in Johnny Dark, who can't keep his own nose over at the coast, comes in here to relate to me that he just had a call from Super Dave.

[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.700]
Okay.

[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.960]
Now if he had any brain, he would have put the call on the phone on a receiver immediately as soon as he heard that voice number one.

[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.280]
Okay.

[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.700]
So if you want to know who keeps encouraging Super Dave to bug us and that you agree what?

[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.540]
The what do you talk to him for?

[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.060]
Can't you say goodbye or is that lonely over at the coast?

[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.400]
And he's telling him about some obscure video guy and some stupid thing from WNWS.

[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.340]
It's got a thing on it.

[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.600]
It's got my name and it's really Steve Kane and people are going to be watching this all over the country.

[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.940]
What the who cares?

[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.680]
Who's going to see it?

[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.660]
Six drugs in which it's on?

[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.320]
Get out of here.

[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.820]
Go away.

[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.560]
Go away.

[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.720]
What do you want?

[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.760]
Oh no, are you even getting women numbers?

[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.540]
We don't have anyone listening to this station.

[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.060]
Do we have anyone on these women?

[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.620]
Hello?

[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.440]
Yeah.

[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.980]
Hold it.

[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.500]
Hello?

[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.180]
Yeah.

[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.800]
Hold it.

[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.700]
Hello?

[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.980]
Hold it.

[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.640]
Are you a mobile?

[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.500]
No.

[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.420]
You're a mobile, right?

[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.280]
No, no, no, no.

[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.740]
Hold on.

[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.300]
Hello?

[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:22.420]
Hi Neil.

[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.120]
We have a lady right there, I told you.

[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.980]
That's one out of four.

[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.260]
So that means that 25% of the women in the market listen to WIOD.

[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.820]
You got it.

[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.200]
Right?

[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.240]
You got it.

[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.600]
Hey Neil, what's going on with Waxi in love 94% of any parts?

[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.680]
Do they want?

[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.680]
Do they have any ratings?

[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.460]
Do they have any numbers now?

[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.420]
No, I don't.

[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.920]
I don't.

[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.260]
First of all, it doesn't mean anything yet because Videl was there during this whole thing, okay?

[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.860]
Yeah.

[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.960]
So you want to start to see that for...

[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.660]
How I see what the little man and the hat's doing?

[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.380]
The little man and the hat?

[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.660]
Well, let's see.

[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.880]
Let's just take a look at 18 plus the little man and the hat in the afternoon.

[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.500]
I went from a 32 to a 42.

[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.340]
He is kickin' butt over there, okay?

[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.680]
They have turned the corner.

[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.980]
They're going to destroy the market.

[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.660]
Yeah.

[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.120]
Greg and Rick together we're getting stereo.

[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.520]
The picture is they call them yesterday, I like that.

[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.480]
Okay, thanks so much.

[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.880]
Okay.

[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.500]
Bye-bye.

[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.760]
Nice hearing your lovely voice.

[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.280]
Thank you.

[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.620]
Bye.

[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.540]
1147 at WIOD where we're dying over here.

[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.500]
WIOD.

[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.920]
Okay, good one.

[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.940]
Let's go to Hollywood.

[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.360]
Hello.

[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.020]
Hi, Neil.

[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.800]
Yeah.

[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.360]
Would you please...

[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.620]
Sir, would you like to give us your name and address?

[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.120]
We will send you a WIOD promotional paper played in the extra charge.

[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.540]
I already have a picture.

[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.880]
If you send us the stamp.

[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.040]
Can you believe that?

[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.600]
Big time radio station, we go out, our promotion where people drive all the way from a steward.

[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.040]
Talk about loyal listeners from a steward.

[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.500]
Do you know how far a steward is, sir?

[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.220]
That's like in Yannem'svelto, the Chinese would say, okay?

[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.020]
They drive all the way down, sounds of the falls.

[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.580]
And we autographed the back of a tool for 15, 10% paper play.

[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.960]
And we say thank you for listening to WIOD.

[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.040]
Would you put it on any side of the one that got caught and got an answer?

[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:07.220]
Sir.

[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.660]
Sir, are you out of control?

[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.620]
I wish.

[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.300]
Can you take a leave of your senses?

[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.040]
I wish.

[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.120]
Don't you realize that it's trashy crap like death that's caused us our entire sophisticated listening?

[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.460]
Any audience with WIOD?

[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.140]
I can't believe it.

[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:21.540]
Clear.

[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.120]
Thank you.

[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.700]
Well, I was driving down 9.95 the other night.

[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.960]
Somebody nearly cut me right off the road.

[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.020]
I decided what I'm going to do any good to get mad.

[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.900]
I wrote a song about him and said, it goes like this.

[00:07:52.980 --> 00:08:00.040]
First people, and then for, or did you work it, it's your whole life.

[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.200]
Any other way, it worked out fine.

[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.880]
It's your assholes and dies.

[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.160]
Get your name, FFH OLE.

[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.380]
Don't you try to blame it on me.

[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.120]
You deserve all the credit.

[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.900]
You're an asshole tonight.

[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.400]
You're an asshole.

[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.300]
You're an asshole.

[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.980]
You're an asshole tonight.

[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.140]
I got a feeling.

[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.440]
You're being an asshole when the whole of your life.

[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:20.860]
You're an asshole tonight.

[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:20.860]

[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:20.860]

[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.360]
I was talking to your mother.

[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.000]
And in the end, you told her, tonight.

[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.540]
I told her, I caught your an asshole tonight.

[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.180]
I think you're right.

[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.560]
And all your friends are apples.

[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.280]
Because you know they have your whole life.

[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.480]
Somebody so mean.

[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.340]
You've got an apple for life.

[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.760]
For you more than apple.

[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.720]
Or did you work in your whole life?

[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.660]
Either way it worked out fine.

[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.760]
Or you're here in it.

[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.780]
You're right.

[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.820]
Holds nice.

[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.720]
Okay, let me 51, and WGW, thanks for the help, Gary.

[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.840]
Let's go to Miami. Hello.

[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:31.700]
Hello.

[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.680]
We couldn't have done it without the programming brain trust.

[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.520]
How you doing today?

[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:37.360]
We're doing it.

[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.820]
We are doing it, sir.

[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.220]
Can you play something?

[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.060]
More than what we're doing.

[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:41.980]
What's that?

[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:42.980]
We're dying over here.

[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.060]
I'm dying over here.

[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:44.420]
Good.

[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.860]
Can you play the Burp commercial for us?

[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.180]
The Burp commercial?

[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.040]
Yeah, I haven't heard it for a while.

[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.240]
I heard it on Rick and Puts.

[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.340]
Yeah, Suz is really hurt.

[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.460]
What do you mean by that?

[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.480]
He's just...

[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.820]
He's bothering me.

[00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.340]
I don't know.

[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.180]
You're not the one that called him up the other day.

[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.580]
That moron that called him...

[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.760]
No, I heard it on the other day.

[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:03.820]

[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.660]
No, that wasn't me.

[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.380]
Well, a lot of negative colors, you know, this...

[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.660]
I keep trying to emphasize.

[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.860]
I know it's a waste of time.

[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.460]
But like the old Cubans, man, when they get the diaries...

[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.600]
You can listen to me.

[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.060]
It's like voting.

[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:17.720]
Okay?

[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:18.300]
You understand?

[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.800]
There's like a loyal listener.

[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:20.420]
They're obsessed.

[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.440]
We here at WYOD, we've got these like wishy-washy

[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.300]
and they're all bitching and complaining on what they want.

[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.400]
And they're not loyal.

[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.640]
They don't support us.

[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.220]
And one of these days we're all going to be gone.

[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.600]
We're all going to be digging bitches out in the middle of Y75.

[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:34.920]
And they're going to want...

[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.640]
Gee, whatever happened to all our good fun and crap and stuff, you know?

[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.280]
Right.

[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.820]
Just ragging on them.

[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:41.360]
Never mind.

[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.640]
I've never really disliked them.

[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.320]
Never real life.

[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.120]
But they're doing a good job.

[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:45.680]
They're fine.

[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.660]
Can you play the burp?

[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.760]
I've got it now.

[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.620]
I'm waiting for you to say goodbye.

[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:49.160]
Goodbye.

[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:49.740]
Goodbye.

[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.320]
One in seven Americans suffers from a terrible affliction.

[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.800]
And while others find it funny, to those who have it, it's no laughing matter.

[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.920]
It's called frequent burping syndrome.

[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.000]
It's terrible.

[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:09.820]
I'll be on a date or a business meeting and...

[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.320]
Excuse me.

[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:12.660]
Excuse me.

[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.640]
Do you want to have it?

[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.460]
Frequent burping syndrome.

[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.180]
It can ruin your life.

[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:18.960]
But it doesn't have to.

[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.140]
Now there's a clinic that can help.

[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.620]
Trained specialists sensitive to the needs of compulsive belchers.

[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.080]
A special place known as burp hinders.

[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:29.600]
Gosh.

[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.600]
Burp hinders saved my life.

[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.080]
And Joanne and I were in love.

[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.160]
I really wanted to ask for the marry me.

[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:39.620]
But I just knew that when the moment of truth came, I'd let out with a big ripper.

[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:40.480]
You know?

[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.300]
Burp hinders.

[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.160]
No shame.

[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:45.980]
No guilt.

[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.740]
No more tummy rumbling.

[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.900]
Smellied belches.

[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.440]
No more stopping and mid-sentence.

[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.560]
The one for a big cheesy blaster.

[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.660]
Just carrying professionals.

[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.240]
And they help you need.

[00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.140]
Still a plate.

[00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.720]
Here's the number to call.

[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.440]
By...

[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.900]
2, 8, 7, 7.

[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.140]
That's by...

[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.460]
By...

[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.360]
Burp hinders.

[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:09.120]
Burp hinders.

[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.520]
Calls a day.

[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.700]
And stop being so gross.

[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:12.260]
Let's see.

[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.940]
Here's women 18 plus in the morning.

[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.280]
And of course, that's love 94.

[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.600]
His big thing is women 2.5 to a 27.

[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.520]
Now Greg, you never had any numbers anywhere.

[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.480]
You're not going to have any now.

[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.760]
So join the rest of us.

[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.060]
We're getting used to it.

[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.620]
Let's go to...

[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.200]
See, I guess Alice was right about that.

[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.000]
Number is me nothing.

[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:28.280]
Right?

[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.300]
That's what Joy always says.

[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.140]
But you know this.

[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.300]
It's always the people who don't have any who say that.

[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.340]
Like me.

[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.060]
Miami.

[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.220]
Yes, Neil.

[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:35.800]
Yes, sir.

[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:36.460]
Question.

[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.220]
Why is it every time the book comes out?

[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.040]
You always go through it.

[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:39.480]
It's arbitrary.

[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.060]
It's supposed to be arbitrary.

[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.640]
When I'm supposed to worry about that, your team is so far to radio.

[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:44.160]
Yeah.

[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.140]
What are you worried about?

[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:45.560]
Yeah.

[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.040]
I'm not worried I say I was worried.

[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.160]
No, no, I'm not.

[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.560]
But you read it all the time as if it means something.

[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.600]
It doesn't mean something.

[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.480]
It does mean something.

[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.620]
Sure, it's our livelihood.

[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:54.820]
I was on it.

[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:55.420]
I don't have.

[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:55.820]
Yeah.

[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.000]
I was in the business.

[00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.840]
And I went to number one in Northeast Louisiana.

[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:00.700]
Oh, man.

[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.160]
That is what I always wanted to do that.

[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.620]
Be number one in Northeast Louisiana.

[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.720]
Yeah, especially a town called Talula.

[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.000]
Yeah, that's my favorite.

[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.520]
But I mean, tell me.

[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.120]
I mean, this stuff doesn't mean anything.

[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:11.700]
Yeah.

[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.000]
Tell that to the people in Atlanta, okay?

[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:15.700]
A cops broadcasted.

[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.300]
Well, they got to have something to go by.

[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.080]
I just like the cops got to stop you and...

[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.640]
We did have it.

[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.900]
We just got to call from Atlanta.

[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:23.700]
You know what they said?

[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:24.080]
What?

[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.480]
They're phone with you and looking.

[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:26.280]
Yeah.

[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.060]
They say.

[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:27.560]

[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:43.260]
knows that birch is bogus but i got an idea if we're doing good in birch let's start saying we

[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:48.000]
think that they do a great job over birch and we're really doing it as birches a joke okay let's

[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.980]
see here we go my any four-letter day what is this for this is the new uh the one fall to winter

the three seven fall of eighty nine it's missing oh man i'm looking at numbers that are so

[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:25.280]
microscopic look at that like a three seven go ahead and don't be confused by borgia or he's

[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.940]

[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.240]
dropping and they have no excuse what is ap we don't have a call in the bat line from peter borgia

[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:06.620]
to try to alibi for their crappy numbers over at zeta okay i mean we know alibi about ours i

[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:12.000]

[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:43.420]
four sixty but it's better than tearing the ticket up but he really did all right yeah great

[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:47.980]
and they bet the new york crowd but in fact it called her to they bet that seven horse with

[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:53.480]
santo's down the way down to six to one or seven to one and he ran a gray race and with approval

[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:58.000]

[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.040]
santo court did a good read huh you paramount no sir uh... i can't believe calder didn't turn that

[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:22.220]
like two or three different horses then you don't turn it around if it's a lot okay but where you've

this brower county sheriff's guy must really be a nickbrain nickbrain or get lost on a nickbrain

[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:40.480]

[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:59.700]
you're going on vacation can i ask you what area you going to

[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.800]
what area i'm going to

[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:05.880]
say in the country you going to Europe between the earth and Uranus

[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.940]
really you think it's advisable i mean you were ill for three weeks you were out

[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:14.420]
you think it's advisable still to take off this time considering the ratings and everything

[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.800]
what is it and are you like a programming expert

[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:21.560]
no i'm just asking i know for job security i mean if my job is questioned

[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:25.260]
i don't know let me say two things to you okay first of all i'm not insecure

[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:30.120]
and secondly i have a contract okay uh-huh well in that case you don't have a

[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:34.040]
nice vacation and play out of trouble okay bye bye sweetie

[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:40.640]
what uh what a oh man kvech what a kvech job security

[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:45.080]
like while i'm away they're going to have randy you know it's going to take over the show

[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:49.180]
i mean she's a very nice young lady and she's fun and you got a good sense of humor

[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.920]
and she used to be married to jfk so please have pity on her

[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:57.660]
but i mean i'm not worried that i mean of course when boy gary is at the helm anything is possible

[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.540]
and if they want me if they want to write me a check for the rest of the year and a half

[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:04.760]
that i have to go that's fine i don't think they want to do that i don't think they're panicking

[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:09.320]
although it is interesting when he comes in here and he says what do you think of it

[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.800]
i'm not the program director i haven't molded this operation okay

[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:19.340]
i mean everything is relative and this show still has the highest numbers on the station okay

[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:24.380]
not what they used to be by any stretch of the imagination but it's that shrinking your

[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:30.660]
audience syndrome again and next month when the entire spring book comes out if it doesn't go

[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:37.140]
back up all the way around then then this time to get insecure and start to give your subred hot

[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:43.500]
dog stand tamarack gone see and i'm not even going to say it i'm not even going to say it

[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:51.460]
doca on the line seven nobody there okay is that a good example now this see i could go in and

[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:55.120]
tell him what i think what the problems are but it would be pointless because where there's no

[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:59.800]
sense there's no feeling because you can keep repeating the same things here for like a year or

[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:04.380]
20 years and as rhanerius found out you're better off just keep your mouth shut and you know leave

[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:08.580]

you know why we only have one more ready to go down but i mean in the book okay we only had one

[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:19.440]
month it started April 24th right we started here April 23rd so this is one month and two months of

[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:26.700]
Alex now Alex was not going to morph like med for right i hate to bring the news to you what but i've

[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:36.160]
been here a year and a half no i just came in here to protect my butt however i will remind people

[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:41.160]
that you were here most of my vacuum when i was sick in the hospital okay well then sure in those

[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:45.120]
down numbers roll it to the chart well i mean you're trying to cover your hands with that two nine

[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:51.300]
no what i was going to say is it started we started April 23rd yeah and the last three to the

[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:57.580]
book last month started April 24th yeah Alex if he had a three and a two and a one which probably

[01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:03.140]
left with about a one okay the average would be a two for the last book right well even if we

[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:07.240]
brought the next month up to a two we were lost the three so even with us being here we were ready to go

[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:16.480]
down do you follow that that's what we're going to do follow that first of all all i can say of this

[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:22.860]
when the spring book comes out the whole book okay if we don't go all go back up the whole station

[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:26.720]
when it occurs when area was smart he knew this was going to happen you just signed for three more

[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:31.420]
years yeah but like you guys and me and of course stand with history anyway it doesn't know it

[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:36.760]
um if we don't go back up they're never gonna crank out your records you're gonna go back up

[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:48.020]
that's what i'm trying to tell you i feel great i feel great about one i was expected to go down

[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:52.560]
do you understand that do you understand what i'm saying is anybody under what the hell am i

[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:58.180]
talking about do you understand that yeah you do yeah okay well we were expecting to go down

[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:03.720]
the fact we went up a tent is just marvelous miraculous unbelievable yeah but when you go up a

[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:08.540]
tent from a two eight it doesn't mean much no but at least we didn't go down see what we have to

[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:14.220]
hope see might disney is now on the like headhandshoek committee with arbitrage and like since that's

[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:21.040]
happened since he's been on the committee they can no longer find the i.o.d listeners every trend i

[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:26.440]
mean used to be like you get one bad one okay yeah every book then we started getting two now we

[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:30.800]
get three now you know they're out there because i've been doing this a long time i mean just look

[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:34.820]
at the phone you know they're out there hey and they're among 100 people with the sponsors in the

[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:39.260]
response they get and look at their most yeah and yet the new deal with arbitrage and look at look

[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:44.180]
it looks like it's an umber is look at a wacky well arbitrage makes the Spanish language and the

[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:49.260]
ethnic sampling that's going on between the Hispanic and black sampling there are no white people

[01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:55.800]
who get diarrhea exactly okay and the white ones don't and the white ones don't send them back

[01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:00.480]
except the middle 90 who like those uh those blues in the wipes that Alice is selling in a

[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.700]
moment why would you think for that if you to hurt that spot you better like them we may all be

[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:08.960]
talking about well we may be using them pretty yeah but do you follow what i say we've got a lot

[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.420]
of hair here before you see this listen you didn't have a lot of hair to leave it right in the

[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:18.340]
front it's on the floor you see this okay i see there's a little average right there that's Alex

[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:23.960]
yeah i see that too barely so like you see three two one okay you don't have to

[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:29.920]
spread it out okay this is also includes March so let's say we brought it back up listen

[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:34.640]
to me yeah this whole thing for all of us also includes exactly you can't fly arch was an

[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:41.760]
unmitigated disaster for the whole station it was the Alex Bennett Memorial Month okay and when

[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.620]
the whole book comes out would you an included March will be gone so if June is pretty good the

[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:51.840]
metal goose this whole thing up right at least a point okay now i got news for you if i go back

[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:57.540]
up over a five yeah next when the whole book comes out i'll be ecstatic you will you guys will

[01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:02.240]
have to like a three five you should kiss we will you and when Yuri goes back up like about a

[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:06.660]
four eight or a five hill kiss Roger on the lips i mean that'll be great are the trends weighted

[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:11.920]
just like a ledge now are there used to be but they are alleged now i don't believe that yeah

[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:17.120]
but you see why we're expecting to go down even if we brought that up that the average between

[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.100]
this you that don't understand we've been expecting you'll back up for a long time we keep expecting

[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:26.820]
and expecting and expecting and expect to expect to wait i thought i thought this one there was no way

[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:31.780]
after the station got to a three six year they think we'd be going down again he was he might

[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:37.060]
as well drove away with cattle prod he did he's only been we've only been here a month you blow

[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:41.880]
away a lot quicker than you think a batch of cast on this well so there's that hex upon us all

[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:47.840]
it'll wear off in fact uh he was last seen before went back to frisco climbing one of my billboards

[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:53.140]
trying to punch those enormous teeth out my god damn throat i heard it's true if he had the ability

[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:58.620]
you would have done it yeah yeah well so do you understand this is a great day i want to say

[01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:02.700]
i was not a great day i want to explain something to you i'm leaving

[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:07.700]
private i'm going to your bed how much back do we you're going to be happy and i don't really care

[01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:13.760]
okay i mean i care but it's not like the issue this is my new home so i care so you should be happy

[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:18.140]
because i'm not unusual because i quite frankly i've never worked at a radio station where you

[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:23.400]
went out on a remote and people came from north Miami and steward and bokeh they don't they wouldn't

[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:28.880]
take any other decision i have let me finish i was there all the way down to south bay almost a

[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:34.760]
p-rime and we signed the back of gefs paper plates from the pizza long so it's pretty bogus

[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:41.560]
not even our own paper plate bogus so the evil twins in our programming office in there

[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:47.160]
not only have they are they overseeing the falling of the Titanic the sinking but they're

[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:51.060]
promotional between the billboards in the paper place we're going to have a poll on that tomorrow

[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:56.960]
and the next remote we're going to do is take the pictures on the billboards and put them on the

[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:02.320]
back of the paper plates so you can sign like on the teeth and roll down the mold with one year rule

[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:03.100]
uh...

[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.580]
well i hope i hope they're listening because i've been full agreement

[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:08.480]
wait a minute are you still there

[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:09.820]
uh...

[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.240]
i'm telling you i can't just

[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:13.980]
uh...

[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:20.340]
okay we're going to give them far side her shoes home phone number maybe you can call him up and

[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:21.880]
cheer him up a little bit is a little under the weather

[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:26.380]
so i feel real good i just came in to say well i'm sure happy that you came in now get the hell out

[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:31.060]
by the way you think reyny martins upset because i took a little up hope that um

[01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:36.560]
no see i want to bounce this off because you know what i'm at with uh... boy giri is already all right

[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:41.600]
and i have a feeling because i said something to her the other day we're kidding around she's got a

[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:46.440]
good sense of the word and i said boy i bet you'd love to do this all the time and her face lit up like

[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:51.400]
a hannaka bush like she's uh... got it in the back of her mind or the front of her mind that she's

[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:57.380]
gonna be like my sidekick you know now i want to emphasize i work alone now i've been

[01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:02.140]
and these numbers in spite of that one in tempered call from lakeland have nothing to do with the

[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:06.780]
bird the bird was a detriment the numbers on this show started going down before the bird left

[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:11.900]
and a lot of that has to do with stuff that went on here last year okay we can't and won't talk about

[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:18.100]
right okay right i'm in total agreement but um... so reyny or nice person but i know she didn't come

[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:22.180]
into that all i don't think that's and i think she may be able to listen if that's gonna get her

[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:24.420]
no cry yeah to yourっちゃ

[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.360]
right here

[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:27.660]
okay i want to talk about them every word

mobile

The lawyer said she wanted big bucks and the plaza hotel.

[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:59.180]
The son of Donald Sonson walked into his room.

[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:03.340]
All that to find is big for a baby.

[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:07.000]
The first call comes to me.

[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:09.340]
I love his kids.

[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.760]

But not only this,

[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:19.280]
like that he's keen,

[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:23.360]
by making her style a bring up shoe.

[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:26.800]
So cheer man,

[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.360]
to cock your flat,

[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:33.140]
to make Donald look by the silly.

[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.620]
To the calmness friends,

[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:39.440]
the whole ugly end,

[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:43.520]
like Donald takes with his willy.

[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:46.700]
Oh, don't want to smart.

[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:48.700]
He will make things easier.

[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:52.820]
And fun to laugh that was fine.

[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.760]
Yeah, just like that.

[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:56.560]
To do, to do,

[01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.240]
to do, to do,

[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:00.240]
to do, to do,

[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:01.740]
to do, to do, to do,

[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:10.520]
to do, to do, to do.

[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:13.160]
I'm about to ask that.

[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:14.920]
You dare to bond him,

[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:15.780]
mess your match.

[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:17.060]
Take the cash,

[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:18.080]
the Donald's only a scratch.

[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:19.380]
And you'll be better,

[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.240]
you'll be better,

[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:21.940]
just as soon as this is over.

[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.100]
And I'm Donald's cycle.

[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.740]
So I'm back in his room,

[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:30.740]
finding more plans to do,

[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.480]
and reliable.

[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:35.020]
The post that Donald is gone,

[01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:37.260]
a bladdering bomb.

[01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:39.580]
And I don't need some

[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:42.060]
and every following one.

[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:43.300]
You say, what?

[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.080]
Just do, just do, just do,

[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:45.520]
come on down,

[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:47.020]
and we'll just do, just do,

[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:47.920]
just come on down,

[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.080]
and we'll do, just do,

[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:49.900]
just do, just do,

[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:50.140]
just do, just do,

[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:50.380]
just do, just do,

[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.560]
just try to get my stuff to go.

[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:53.900]
But when would you look at?

[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.260]
147 at W.I.O.D. Margate.

[01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:56.900]
Meal.

[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:57.440]
Yeah.

[01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:59.040]
Yeah, I had to tell you about this

[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.680]
mung brain friend of mine.

[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:02.120]
He's a cable man

[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:03.760]
and win more of all things.

[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:04.440]
Mm-hmm.

[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:07.800]
Anyway, he was telling me

[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.820]
about these oxygenated olive oil

[01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:10.160]
in him.

[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:11.840]
I thought a little,

[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.220]
uh, Godfather music might be appropriate.

[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:14.920]
Yeah, okay.

[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:15.740]
It's good luck to you.

[01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:16.860]
W.I.O.D.

[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:19.280]
W.I.O.D.

[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:20.840]
Yeah, can I have a question?

[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:21.240]
Something.

[01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:22.140]
A meal.

[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:23.020]
A meal.

[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:23.340]
Have you heard?

[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:24.140]
I have a question?

[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:24.800]
Something from Neal.

[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:25.220]
Like what?

[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:26.940]
Like the perfenders thing

[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:27.840]
that I've been dining here.

[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:28.940]
I want my girlfriend to hear it.

[01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:30.400]
We already played it today, sir.

[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:31.960]
I'll let you actually

[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:32.580]
take a picture.

[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:33.800]
It's not a long cart.

[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.640]
It's a minute and 21 seconds.

[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:36.500]
I met her at an office.

[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:37.700]
I give anything to hear it.

[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:38.500]
You ride her orifice?

[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:39.160]
Yeah.

[01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:41.060]
Okay, it's in the machine right now, sir.

[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:41.680]
Thanks.

[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:42.540]
Anytime.

[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:44.980]
Sure, because I have a feeling

[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:46.540]
that could be the next Duane's stop.

[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:47.360]
That cart.

[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:48.580]
It's getting close.

[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:50.400]
It's like bubbling under Duane's stop.

[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:51.820]
Kendall.

[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.600]
You know, if we could pull that number up,

[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:57.180]
can you imagine what the station would look like then?

[01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:57.600]
Yeah.

[01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:59.560]
Let's go to the nice room for me, Steve.

[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:00.700]
Here's in the barn.

[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:10.000]
I hold on this time, as if I don't hang up.

[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:10.740]
W-Y-O-D.

[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:15.040]
I-O-D, what do you want?

[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:17.200]
Okay.

[01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:18.940]
Let's go to the Fort Lauderdale.

[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:19.520]
New.

[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:20.100]
Yeah.

[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:21.060]
Hey.

[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.500]
I'll let you know what you want.

[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.120]
I'll let you know what you want.

[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:26.340]
I'll let you know what you want.

[01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:27.600]
Do you want to know what you want?

[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:29.000]
In Jewish polka nose?

[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:29.520]
Yeah.

[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:31.720]
Where do you ever hear that?

[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:33.520]
Sir?

[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:36.520]
My friend told me to request it, because he's like, you know,

[01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:37.960]
he's sick and stuff, because he calls...

[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:38.440]
He's sick?

[01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:39.220]
Yeah.

[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:40.120]
Like in a head?

[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:42.980]
I don't know, he didn't stick at the coldest of the...

[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:44.720]
Or is he just spent a lot of time in the head?

[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:45.780]
I don't know.

[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:47.020]
Okay, I'm planning to call you.

[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:47.840]
You never heard before?

[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:50.880]
No, he just told me to let you wear it to hear that song.

[01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:51.540]
I called his name.

[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.420]
Who's whistling on the other end there, sir?

[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:54.460]
I don't know.

[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:55.560]
It's probably my sister.

[01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:57.540]
Okay, well, tell your sister to get lost.

[01:20:57.740 --> 01:20:58.580]
Go leasing, okay?

[01:20:58.580 --> 01:20:59.140]
Okay.

[01:20:59.360 --> 01:20:59.880]
See ya.

[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:01.220]
Hello, I'm Ston.

[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:02.180]
And I'm Harry.

[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:04.180]
Here to tell you about a special place.

[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.260]
Just a short little drive.

[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:10.900]
From New York, it's the polka nose.

[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:11.920]
Let's go.

[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:14.840]
That's where I want to go.

[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.900]
To get away from it all.

[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:17.740]
What was that?

[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:19.460]
In the polka nose.

[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:22.040]
He can feel that pain.

[01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:24.060]
I saw that stuff.

[01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:26.380]
A shuffleboard, a jume.

[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:27.940]
I got a nine.

[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:29.780]
Go for Saturday, lunch.

[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.540]
All for the food on top of your day.

[01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:35.340]
I hope it's coaching the polka nose.

[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:37.260]
Guy top and bockyle.

[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:38.820]
Can't hold back in worship.

[01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:41.180]
Manally, a shoney.

[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:42.700]
They're even making money.

[01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:43.260]
No.

[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:44.640]
Let's rock and press.

[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:47.040]
Oh, we let the polka in.

[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.520]
The polka nose.

[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:50.460]
We'll have some lunch.

[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.720]
And then we'll see our show.

[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.240]
Bristol, New Orlando.

[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.340]
In the polka nose.

[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:00.960]
Get a hot shake.

[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.520]
No, for the champagne.

[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:06.300]
Sit by the pool and act like a show.

[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:09.280]
Let's get the chicks who get me in a show.

[01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:12.380]
Over by the exercise bar.

[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.080]
Hey, choose your way in the polka nose.

[01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:16.820]
Guy top and bockyle.

[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:18.520]
Can't hold back in worship.

[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.780]
Manally, a shoney.

[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:23.000]
Don't forget Mickey Ragnos.

[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.780]
They rock and press go.

[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:28.220]
Oh, we let the polka in the polka nose.

[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.240]
We'll have some lunch.

[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:32.280]
And then we'll see our show.

[01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:37.300]
We let the polka in the polka nose.

[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:38.840]
In the polka nose.

[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:39.520]
Let's go.

[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:40.620]
If you get your teeth in the water.

[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:42.340]
I don't like my teeth in the little bag.

[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.360]
But the water in the evidence.

[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:45.400]
153 and of course the fluson wipes.

[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.460]
Let's go to a halendale.

[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:47.780]
Hello.

[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:48.440]
Hey, Neil.

[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:48.860]
Yeah.

[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:49.680]
He's the cutie.

[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:50.620]
He's in the phone today.

[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:51.780]
Who is that?

[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:52.340]
Nick.

[01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:52.980]
Laura.

[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:53.520]
Laura.

[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:54.240]
What do you want?

[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.380]
I just want to say hello.

[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:56.140]
And no, Laura.

[01:22:56.260 --> 01:23:00.140]
She's a cheap, sweet little talker over there.

[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:00.360]
Ah.

[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:01.640]

[01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:01.820]
Ah.

[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:01.980]

[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:02.360]
Ah.

[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:02.520]
Ah.

[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:02.780]

[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:02.780]

[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:02.880]

[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:02.880]

[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:03.020]
Ah.

[01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:03.860]
Ah.

[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:03.920]

[01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:05.900]
Ah.

[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:06.460]
Ah.

[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:06.460]

[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:06.980]
Ah.

[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:08.320]
That's a good one now.

[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:09.160]
The opera is there.

You know, every time somebody hangs up.

[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:29.880]
Will you tell us who hung up so we can call and bother you?

[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:31.860]
Well, I tell you what?

[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:34.920]
You know, like when I hang up now, and you say.

No, I didn't know that. Well, Nails' numbers were real bad, so we're putting Sandy back on.

[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:58.580]
