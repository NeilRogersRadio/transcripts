New stock Radio 610 WIOD presents Neil Rogers to get a touch and talk call 751 WIOD in

[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.060]
day.

[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.380]
524 WIOD enbrower or 655 and 278 WIOD in the Palm Beach.

[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.120]
Other areas may call collect.

[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.780]
The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the

[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.140]
station.

[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.220]
Now here's Neil Rogers on New stock Radio 610 WIOD.

[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.640]
1007 WIOD is a great day for the Irish A.

[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.900]
Unfortunately they're all on vacation and we got Bill Cosford coming up at noon today

[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.960]
today.

[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.080]
It's my only guest.

[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.080]
They can steal my cards.

[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.620]
You can steal my material but lay off my goddamn blues way to choose.

[00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.740]
Okay guys, put the crap.

[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.780]
Man, do you believe that?

[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.660]
Also, I noticed the same thing they did but they were sharpened up to a mentioned on

[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.860]
the air about Greg V. Down the article that Tom Jicca wrote in the slum sentinel on Saturday

[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.020]
and it's in turn to page 7D or whatever it was to continue and it was nothing there.

[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.660]
It was gone.

[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.080]
History.

[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.080]
And so this morning because the sun sent those great American newspaper, they finished

[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.280]
it all off and quite frankly they had the better idea the first time.

[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.920]
There's not much there.

[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.360]
I want to congratulate Dave Caprita on getting a job being in town.

[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.220]
He's probably listening right now unless he's one of those programming meetings.

[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.460]
However, I listened a little bit this morning and I'm not making this up.

[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.660]
I was heart pressed to punch out the coast because they kept pulling a lot of records

[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.040]
that I liked but I did punch over there and I heard Caprita with noodles.

[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.280]
Dave, I'm happy for you and good luck.

[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.840]
You know what I mean?

[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.600]
Like Laxala and the music they're playing on Gloves 94 that esoteric obscure jazz

[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.740]
that nobody ever heard before gets serious.

[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.760]
I mean that stuff is went out with low button shoes.

[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.020]
I mean, forget it.

[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.260]
But anyway, good luck Dave.

[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.060]
I'm glad you're doing the thing and we got the ball game tonight.

[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.360]
We got concerted noon.

[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.240]
Lots of heavy duty stuff.

[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.560]
We also have any minute now, any day at the arrival of the program director for a

[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.060]
coast, Fleetwood Groover.

[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.820]
Now, there are people in the audience holding their sides and thinking that I'm making that up.

[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.280]
Oh wow, me.

[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.160]
But I got news for it.

[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.660]
That's his name.

[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.440]
Now, you know that nobody made that up, right?

[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.180]
Fleetwood Groover who's coming to us from WBT in Charlotte, North Carolina.

[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.900]
Hey.

[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.700]
Oh, I bet you he is some heavy duty stuff.

[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.120]
So he'll be in for a real shock when it gets to this place.

[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.340]
OK, 1009 at WIOD.

[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.320]
We got a bunch of calls on the board already, which is really great.

[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.120]
Neat Keen swell.

[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.400]
And we don't care.

[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.580]
FPL will be changing next Monday, by the way.

[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.760]
The big band sounds will be coming back.

[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.440]
Uh-huh.

[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.300]
They'll be great.

[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.380]
Granny, get your teeth out of the glass.

[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.460]
So we can chew it over.

[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.640]
Big bands are coming back to FPL.

[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.360]
What a joke.

[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.360]
What a travesty.

[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.520]
And isn't it interesting?

[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.020]
I guess it's just the coincidence that King Paul with the big schnauz, the guy who owns

[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.500]
that station went out of town Friday before the massacre takes place this week and left

[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.780]
other underlings to tell everybody how to use our rivet d'arch your asses can.

[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.700]
Isn't that nice?

[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.760]
King Paul, you make me sick.

[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.660]
You make me want a bar.

[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.060]
His nose is big as Patsy Montana, you know?

[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.520]
What else?

[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.000]
That about it.

[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.920]
Don't forget tonight.

[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.760]
We have big things doing.

[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.900]
Collect from Cleveland.

[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.100]
Hello.

[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.120]
Are you serious?

[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.020]
Oh, semi-serious.

[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.420]
Actually, I'm in Columbus right now.

[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.320]
You're in Columbus?

[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.240]
Is this Christopher?

[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.300]
Christopher.

[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.700]
Uh.

[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.780]
The Italian, the Jewish sailor?

[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.640]
Is that one?

[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.500]
Christopher Columbus?

[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.020]
How are you, Neil?

[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.480]
Okay, you're in Columbus?

[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.980]
Yeah.

[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.820]
Sionto Downs.

[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.340]
I was in Cleveland.

[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.960]
Ohio State University.

[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.620]
Kent State University.

[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.520]
The United States Trotting Association.

[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.340]
Have you ever been in this room?

[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.040]
No.

[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.940]
Have you heard of it?

[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.480]
Yes, sir.

[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.360]
Beautiful track up.

[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.280]
So what do you want?

[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.080]
I don't know.

[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.240]
You just talk to somebody from home.

[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.300]
Boys, Johnny Dirk over there next door,

[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.780]
they got that music at the coast crowd.

[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.840]
I mean, I like the music, but not while I'm on the air.

[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.340]
They got to cranked up again, loud.

[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.840]
That's it.

[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.320]
Cut it down.

[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.040]
See, he's listening, so he cut the crap.

[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.420]
Don't ever go to Cleveland.

[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.560]
I've been there.

[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.800]
Have you what you think of it?

[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.840]
Cleveland is like a cesspool.

[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.240]
It's dirty and schmutzy.

[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.320]
I turned on this.

[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.940]
I turned on the channel for the news from my hotel room.

[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.520]
Yeah.

[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.920]
It's just bright space, I suppose.

[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.800]
Dan Coglin.

[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.160]
We couldn't get rid of him in Miami, channel three.

[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.240]
Well, what the hell are you doing there?

[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.880]
Oh.

[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.260]
Because this call is just, I had a lot of calls on the board

[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.640]
when before I punched this up.

[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.380]
Hey.

[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.660]
So you were beloved copies in Pittsburgh last night?

[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.640]
We don't discuss baseball on the show anymore.

[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.880]
With 40 degrees outside.

[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.660]
Uh-huh.

[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.080]
I had a call at home in the middle of the game.

[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.900]
Norm Kent, a maniac, was calling me from three-rovers stadium

[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.480]
in the stadium on a payphone.

[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.700]
Yeah, but that's where I was.

[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.460]
I was, I was president, right?

[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.920]
To where I was.

[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.140]
Yeah.

[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.980]
I wish you would have run into him with the tractor.

[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.680]
It was only a dozen people, it was so out there.

[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.080]
He says, what's wrong with the cubs?

[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.720]
What's wrong with that?

[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.600]
I said, get off my phone, you jerk.

[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.200]
That is a fish to the game.

[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.340]
Yeah.

[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.880]
Have a nice life.

[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.180]
Take a bite, sir.

[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.260]
I can't take a bite.

[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.400]
Needless to say, this is correct.

[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.380]
Have a nice life.

[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.460]
Bye.

[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:12.860]
Uh-huh.

[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.100]
W-I-O-D.

[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.820]
Hello.

[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.280]
OK, panic, panic city.

[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.260]
W-I-O-D.

[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.760]
OK, two panics in a row.

[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.120]
We got a little trifecta going there.

[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.880]
I-O-D.

[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.120]
What do you want?

[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.140]
What is it?

[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:28.980]
Oh.

[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.960]
Yeah, phony voice, crank.

[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:31.980]
Hold on.

[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.980]
We'll get to you.

[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.680]
W-I-O-D.

[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.180]
Hold on.

[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.120]
W-I-O-D.

[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.120]
Hello.

[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.680]
Speak up.

[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.920]
Or forever hold it.

[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.540]
OK, W-I-O-D.

[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.500]
OK, we got some business to do then.

[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.540]
I'll talk about the game tonight.

[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.300]
We'll take a few calls.

[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.320]
We got Cosper at noon.

[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.040]
W-I-O-D.

[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.000]
Really?

[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.060]
Hold on, sweetie.

[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.800]
OK, let's tell you about Low Jack right now.

[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.600]
If your car is important to you, like mine is to me,

[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.580]
then you better do something to protect it.

[00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.580]
OK, because the auto thieves are out there.

[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.380]
We have an epidemic of auto theft in South Florida.

[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.300]
As they say over in the Gables, word number one.

[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.140]
OK, that's right.

[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.340]
An auto theft in the country.

[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.880]
And that's why you have to protect that big investment in your car,

[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.560]
your truck, your van, whatever the hell it is.

[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.140]
Low Jack really works.

[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.320]
It's proven protection.

[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.160]
That low-jack transmitter that they installed in your car,

[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.580]
they can do the installation by the way,

[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.600]
while you're working in your office,

[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.600]
or home wherever you want.

[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.840]
They'll come right to you and do a good professional quick installation.

[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.660]
And if your car is stolen, you go out there,

[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.420]
and you say, holy cow, what the hell am I going to do?

[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.660]
You pick up the phone, call police.

[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.580]
And out of their computer, all they do is punch in a couple of numbers

[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.620]
that activate that low-jack transmitter and sends out a homing signal

[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.180]
that they zoom in on in just a matter of minutes.

[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.780]
And generally in 30 minutes to 90 minutes or less,

[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.940]
they have that car back in one piece

[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.400]
while it's still worth getting back before they strip it down.

[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.820]
And it's gone forever.

[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.300]
And you have like a nightmare on your hand.

[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.520]
So if nothing else, at least pick up the phone,

[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.720]
call this toll free number, get all the information.

[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.000]
And I think you want to make an intelligent decision

[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.380]
by getting low-jack protection.

[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.380]
The price is right too.

[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.640]
Call toll free, 1-800-53-Low-Jack,

[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:04.700]
and ask for Elaine.

[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.020]
That's 1-800-535-6522.

[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:10.260]
Ask for a lane.

[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.080]
Get all the straight dope on low-jack.

[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.060]
But on MTV, there will be 20 seconds of dead air.

[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.660]
I know you're not going.

[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.020]
You wouldn't leave us, especially before the trip to Chicago.

[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:20.940]
W-I-O-D.

[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:21.960]
Marvin?

[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:22.740]
Yeah?

[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.520]
Let's speak with Marvin, please.

[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.000]
Speaking.

[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.580]
What do you want?

[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:28.320]
What do you want?

[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.800]
I want to talk with Marvin.

[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:30.940]
This is Melvin, Hovann.

[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.200]
The solar-flex spot is on it.

[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.280]
Also, I do want to warn you that the picture,

[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.540]
some of the cable here is erratic.

[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.340]
And of course, I know that's unusual for cable,

[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.680]
because usually it's crystal clear.

[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.960]
And the picture is unpredictable.

[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.560]
Now this morning, it's clear as a bell, the picture.

[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.940]
And if the boogie board spot that was on yesterday,

[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.260]
if that should come on MTV during the show at any time,

[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.680]
you will hear a long pause, OK?

[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.600]
Like the guys Golden Retriever with a long pause.

[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.680]
Speaking of a place to have a great time, watch a little TV,

[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.400]
maybe watch a ballgame, sit back, meet your friends,

[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.240]
and just have a great afternoon, or midday, or evening.

[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.740]
Whatever the hell you want to go over, fat Tuesdays.

[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.400]
Rick and slut were there a couple of weeks ago,

[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.920]
and I was there to join in and kind of rub elbows

[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.660]
with some of the people so to speak.

[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.380]
You know what I mean, Pat?

[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.540]
And we had a great time down there.

[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.180]
And you will too.

[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.780]
It's the place in that neck of the woods.

[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.060]
In fact, it's about the only place in that neck of the woods.

[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.860]
It's in the Miracle Center at 3301 Coral Way.

[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.300]
They're open every morning at 1130.

[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.060]
They have a great happy hour every afternoon between 4 and 8.

[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.340]
Every Wednesday night, including tomorrow night,

[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.000]
is college night at Fat Tuesdays with tutors, shooters,

[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:35.760]
yellow shots.

[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.580]
And of course, that largest election in the world

[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.060]
are frozen specialty drinks.

[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.560]
Whichever one fits your personality, like the headbutt,

[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.220]
or the white Russian, or the strawberry collater,

[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.960]
the purple passion, or the tropical itch, or the 57 Chevy,

[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.420]
or for our senior citizens, the triple bypass.

[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.900]
There's something for everybody.

[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.040]
And a great time waiting for you every day,

[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:55.820]
seven days a week.

[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.920]
Never cover charge either.

[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.820]
At Fat Tuesdays, you tell a meal and Rick and Sluts

[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.360]
sent you by their in the Miracle Center,

[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.880]
3301 Coral Way in Miami.

[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.920]
The Sixth in W.

[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.380]
The Sixth in W.

[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.460]
Summer 1990 is the summer of Dick Tracy.

[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.720]
You'll see the movie.

[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.760]
Listen to the soundtrack,

[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.020]
where the T-shirt, and read the comic book.

[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.360]
And now, just in time for Father's Day,

[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.580]
you can enjoy the fragrance that was inspired by the movie,

[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.400]
the soundtrack, the T-shirt, and the comic book.

[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.400]
New Dick Tracy Cologne.

[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.240]
Why smell like other guys?

[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.640]
Now you can smell like Dick.

[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.800]
What the hell are you talking about?

[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.140]
1026 at W.

[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.960]
I.O.D. Now, let me do the thing about the game,

[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.420]
or we're never going to get this in, okay?

[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.800]
Because we've only got an hour and a half,

[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.960]
and then Bill Cosford, the movie cryptic of the hero of...

[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.620]
No, don't panic, because we're not just going to talk about movies.

[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.440]
We'll find out what Cosford hated the bird,

[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.840]
and why he's so evasive and elusive,

[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.320]
and why he pretends to live here when he lives in Jersey.

[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.260]
It'll be pretty interesting.

[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.700]
Tonight is W.I.O.D., Neil Rogers,

[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.900]
Wayne's plus knight at Pompa No Municipal Stadium,

[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.140]
the game between the miracle and a West Palm Beach expose.

[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.160]
Game is at 705,

[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.960]
and the pregame autograph signing at 630,

[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.460]
and it's easy to get there.

[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.940]
It's north of Atlantic Boulevard west of Federal Highway.

[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.540]
But I guess...

[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.100]
It's like off Federal Highway, right?

[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.240]
You can see it from Federal Highway.

[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.460]
Yeah, you get there, no problem.

[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.700]
Gilbert's going to sing a God Bless America

[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.680]
before the game and take me out to the ball game

[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.800]
during the seventh inning stretch,

[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.100]
and the first 750 fans who show...

[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.060]
Don't forget, if you want to come to the game tonight,

[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.580]
bring about your people, just mention my name at the gate,

[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.460]
and you'll all get in free, okay?

[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.020]
Because we do have a lot of free loaders out there,

[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.520]
and just mentioning the word free, of course,

[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.460]
immediately we'll add another couple thousand people.

[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.840]
The first 750 you show up will get a miracle pen and free,

[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.480]
and a coupon good for a free,

[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.580]
there's that word again dinner.

[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.560]
When you buy one dinner at either wings plus location,

[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.880]
87 West Prospect and Fort Lauderdale,

[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.700]
98 East Samperot and Oral Springs,

[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:49.840]
Tom Deneburg will be there,

[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.060]
and you can beat up up on him too, okay?

[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.800]
We might even sing Tom Song for him at the ball game.

[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:56.740]
So be sure and come out tonight.

[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:57.640]
We'd like to have a good crowd,

[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.340]
make it look respectable, okay?

[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.020]
1027, we do have a line that just vacated in Dade County,

[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.080]
pretty depressing, 751, WIOD.

[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.420]
Now, what I was going to ask before,

[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.620]
is everybody out of school now?

[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.380]
No?

[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.200]
Just Broward and all the college punks, right?

[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.220]
Okay. A lady in Pompano.

[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.480]
Hello there.

[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.440]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.180]
I want you to know that I'm a Pompano Park supporter,

[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.240]
and I've heard Alan Sinkelson is going to be

[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.920]
at the baseball game as Miracles,

[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.140]
Stadium this evening, maybe?

[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.440]
Well, it will be a miracle if he shows up, you're right.

[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.220]
Well, he claims he's the real baseball supporter in the area.

[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.620]
Yeah, well, look at...

[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.300]
He's the Yankee fans, what does that tell you?

[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.720]
Well, he's a miracle fan now.

[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.560]
Is he really?

[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:35.960]
Yep.

[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:36.740]
Well, that's great.

[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:37.800]
Thanks.

[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.000]
Okay.

[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:40.820]
Thanks, what?

[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.560]
Did that make any sense to you?

[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.920]
I must have been one of Alan's friends.

[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:46.380]
WIOD.

[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.720]
Yeah, Marvin, please.

[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:48.660]
Marvin?

[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.480]
Yes, sir.

[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:51.480]
What do you want?

[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.560]
I want to speak to Marvin.

[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.300]
About what?

[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.140]
I'm going to Buffalo.

[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:54.940]
Yeah.

[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:55.400]
But Joey.

[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.640]
Let me tell you something.

[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:57.540]
What's that?

[00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.620]
The bus leaves in an hour.

[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.500]
Right out here in front of the 79th Street Causeway,

[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.740]
and Sally's going to come along, too.

[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.240]
It ought to be a really exciting ride.

[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.700]
Sally Ride?

[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.860]
Wasn't she the astronaut?

[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:09.540]
Huh?

[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:10.680]
Yeah, how do you like that?

[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.860]
Now, she wasn't the one that got killed though, right?

[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.840]
That was the school teacher, as Reagan said.

[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:15.980]
WIOD.

[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.140]
Yeah, hi.

[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.800]
I just heard they announced the game for tonight.

[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.820]
I think you better check the schedule.

[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.340]
I think it's at 605.

[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:26.320]
What?

[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.380]
The game.

[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.240]
It's double header.

[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.040]
Okay.

[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.680]
Because the game last night.

[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.800]
The game was right out last night.

[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.400]
Well, I got news for you.

[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:32.620]
Okay.

[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.020]
We better get that straightened out.

[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.980]
Because I'm not going to be doing, you know,

[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.440]
I don't want to sound like Mr. Primadana,

[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.200]
but I don't think I'm going to be up there doing PA

[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.760]
for a double header or the Gilbert can sing twice, you know?

[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.600]
You may have to call Harry in for that.

[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.900]
Yeah, they were rained out last night.

[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:46.860]
Yeah, they were rained out, right?

[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.760]
Yeah, so before you show up at 630, you know, I check it.

[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.180]
Well, maybe we could get Mr. Deneberg to find out

[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.460]
because as usual, anytime we go out and do something

[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.540]
of this radio station, it turns out to be a disaster, as you know.

[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.120]
Because nobody lets us know what the hell is going on.

[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:01.820]
So we'll find out.

[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.760]
Well, I get that.

[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:03.960]
Hopefully, hopefully we'll see you there.

[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:04.580]
Thank you.

[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:04.940]
Hey, yeah.

[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:05.240]
Okay.

[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.260]
Did you hear that, Melvin?

[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.020]
We don't know what the hell is going on.

[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.720]
Okay, get a hold of that little pimple head.

[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.040]
Okay, that little zit, that walking zit in the sales department

[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.340]
and give his head a squeeze and see what happens.

[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:16.880]
Excuse me.

[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.620]
W-I-O-D.

[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:18.660]
Who's this?

[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:19.980]
Melvin.

[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.640]
Oh, Neil.

[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:22.120]
Yeah.

[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.540]
The miracle game tonight is actually going to start

[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:26.880]
at the regular time seven o'clock.

[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.020]
They call me Sustidobus.

[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:29.420]
Who's this?

[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:30.720]
Who's who?

[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.200]
You.

[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.940]
Oh, this is the ledger sports reporter.

[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:34.700]
The what?

[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:35.720]
The ledger sports reporter.

[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.000]
The ledger's what?

[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.300]
The wrong information on when you were going to be there last week.

[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.240]
The Jewish ledger?

[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.580]
The Jewish ledger.

[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.100]
The pompano Jewish sports ledger.

[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:44.480]
Great.

[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.780]
We got a story about Sandy Kofax's where Ann Al Rosen.

[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.400]
What was his name?

[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.180]
Joel Herschorn?

[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.040]
No, not Herschorn.

[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:52.540]
He's a lawyer.

[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.760]
Joel Herschorn.

[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.740]
No, for the white socks.

[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:55.160]
Joel.

[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.700]
Oh, gee.

[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.540]
The Jewish pitcher.

[00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.060]
Come on.

[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:58.740]
Come on.

[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.440]
Anybody from the world with no words?

[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.120]
Joel Herschorn.

[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:02.700]
Joel Herschorn.

[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:03.480]
That's true.

[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.140]
Cubs don't have any Jews on their team.

[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.360]
For any of you.

[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.420]
The pepper, Ryan Sandberg.

[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:09.800]
Sand, Sandberg.

[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:10.860]
It's just a little joke.

[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.420]
Now what is it?

[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.660]
The game is a regular time?

[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.400]
The regular time.

[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:14.040]
Seven o'clock.

[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.020]
Normally they are at six if it's a double header,

[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.780]
but due to the fact that you're going to be there,

[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.380]
I guess the miracle kept things on schedule.

[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.640]
You're sure of this?

[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.500]
Call them this morning.

[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:25.420]
You're positive.

[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.940]
But it will be a double header.

[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:28.740]
That's true.

[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.220]
Starting at seven?

[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.120]
Starting at seven.

[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.900]
Of course it's a double header.

[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.260]
The Zemmy 1 game is a seven in the game?

[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.520]
Both games are seven in the game.

[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.380]
Oh, thank God.

[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.020]
I don't know.

[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:39.780]
Okay, thank you, sir.

[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.780]
By the way, Ellen Finkelson, the great baseball player.

[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.020]
The great BS artist, yes?

[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.800]
Has never been to a miracle game.

[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.660]
No, I'm sure of it.

[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.580]
I'm looking forward to seeing you tonight.

[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.120]
I'm also never still afraid to train.

[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:52.560]
Absolutely.

[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.540]
Okay, thank you.

[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:54.340]
Adios.

[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:55.140]
Shalom.

[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.080]
1031 at WIOD.

[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.780]
Well, we have some conflicting information there.

[00:16:58.940 --> 00:16:59.900]
I'm sure one of them is right.

[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:00.880]
WIOD.

[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:01.920]
Hi, I'm Ivan.

[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:02.460]
Yeah.

[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.060]
I'm on the scan tonight to get tickets.

[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.800]
What do we have to sign up for?

[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.060]
No, just mention Eels' name at the door and I'll let you in for free.

[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.440]
Okay, thank you very much.

[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.100]
Okay, no problem.

[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.300]
Why do I keep answering that line?

[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.140]
Nobody else will get on.

[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.260]
Like this guy is still holding.

[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:16.720]
Are you there?

[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.140]
Do you think he's still there?

[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.860]
I better put him back on hold.

[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:21.760]
He's been out a long time.

[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.700]
He's busy in the office.

[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:23.640]
WIOD.

[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.200]
Marvin.

[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:24.880]
Yeah.

[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.940]
Is my package ready?

[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:26.720]
Yeah.

[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.020]
It's in the bag.

[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:28.540]
Two, okay.

[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.140]
Okay.

[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:29.480]
Bye.

[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.560]
See ya.

[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.700]
28-11 at WIOD.

[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.960]
So we'll get that straightened out.

[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.080]
That'll be another little hook to keep you tuned in for at least another five-teminence

[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.460]
until we absolutely for sure.

[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.340]
This guy from the Jewish ledger, he sounded like he knew what he was talking about.

[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:42.500]
WIOD.

[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.560]
Yeah, can you guys give me directions to Arnold's Royal Castle?

[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:46.980]
Where are you now?

[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.620]
I'm on 95 headaches now.

[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.760]
What planet are you on?

[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.440]
Zero, are you on the Earth or Uranus?

[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.040]
I'm on.

[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.340]
This must be in the already guy.

[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:54.400]
Yeah.

[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.480]
You're on I-95 whereabouts?

[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.800]
I'm just south of Dakota.

[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.060]
Dakota?

[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:00.720]
Yeah.

[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.100]
Dakota?

[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.660]
Yeah, I'm up in Florida, but I'm heading towards Miami.

[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:05.480]
South Dakota?

[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:06.320]
Yeah.

[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.640]
No, come on, where are you?

[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:07.920]
No, Dakota.

[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.000]
I mean, you know, the design center for the Americas around the Florida airport.

[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.460]
Around the Fort Lauderdale Airport on I-95?

[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.700]
Yeah, south of there.

[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.180]
You're also by Griffin Road, you mean?

[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.120]
Yeah, we're on Griffin Road.

[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.960]
Why did you say that instead of Dakota, it sounded like you're in the state.

[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:22.820]
Okay, well.

[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.080]
Okay, so you say, you keep cal- oh, you got a way to go.

[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:25.720]
Okay.

[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.180]
You come down not that far.

[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.200]
You come down past the Golden Glades, right?

[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:29.840]
You know where that is?

[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.060]
Yeah.

[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:30.800]
Can you handle that?

[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.100]
Yeah.

[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.100]
And then you come down to 125th Street.

[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:34.820]
That's 125th.

[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:35.640]
Right.

[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.340]
Okay, I want to spell that out for you.

[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:37.680]
Okay.

[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.460]
You get off there, you go west.

[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.240]
One block.

[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.580]
Just one short, like half a block.

[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.220]
Half a block.

[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:49.040]
And right on the corner of 441 and 125th Street, there will be Arnold's Road Castle.

[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.540]
There will be all kinds of signs about nearly this and nearly that.

[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.680]
And Neil here and et cetera.

[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:54.500]
Okay.

[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.480]
Leave a lot of money and have a great lunch.

[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.720]
All right, we appreciate it, Neil.

[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.160]
And give away in a big kiss for us.

[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.920]
All right, hey, do you want me to have some jill or something?

[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.120]
Uh, Cospor's going to be here at noon.

[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.720]
No, I don't know, because he's kind of a picky.

[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.200]
Yeah, I haven't sent a bunch of stuff over.

[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.200]
I'm not going to eat any else.

[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.300]
Yeah, I know you're not eating anything out.

[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.740]
I'm going to bring some diet soda, but I have lunch at Mommy's today,

[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.720]
because it's Tuesday, but yeah, Cospor, I'm sure I'll pick out a little bit.

[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.560]
Okay, well, let's go and shoot a win-luck to away.

[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.840]
I want to call my friend Dennis and four-large nail to his bag.

[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.640]
Okay, sir.

[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.360]
Thanks a lot, Neil.

[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:19.960]
Enjoy it.

[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.240]
Bye-bye.

[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.860]
Okay, boy, we're really instructional today.

[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.180]
Guns and roses.

[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.020]
Oh, look at that sweet child of mine.

[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.400]
Are they grotesque or what, huh?

[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.520]
Great record, but they just, hmm.

[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.020]
They look like schmutzon wheels.

[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.680]
I tell you, I shouldn't have said that because all those punk kids are out of school.

[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.840]
Dade schools are out on the 20th.

[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.280]
Broward is out on the 14th.

[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.780]
I don't think so.

[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:43.940]
Today is what?

[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:44.320]
The fifth?

[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.880]
Well, how come these kids in Broward are like calling in?

[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.140]
You called?

[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.840]
Well, don't start sucking around just because you're leaving.

[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.900]
Okay, we have an open line in Broward.

[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.420]
524, Melvin.

[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.860]
524, WIOD.

[00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.660]
Want to tell you about Toyota of Hollywood.

[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:03.540]
If you are in the market, if you're thinking about trading for a new car, please check out those

[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.600]
beautiful, those well-made, those incredible looking 1990 Toyota's.

[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:13.400]
And the 91 Prevy of Van, the biggest, the most luxurious van that Toyota's ever built.

[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:19.500]
And the 91 MR2 and MR2 Turbo, the one that drives like a Ferrari at a 5th of the

[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:19.640]
cost.

[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.880]
And it is, I know that sounds crazy, okay?

[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.520]
Because the MR2, like a little sports car.

[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.580]
But when you drive it, you are going to be shocked at the new 91 MR2 Turbo.

[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.220]
It is fast.

[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.100]
It is luxurious.

[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.100]
It is incredible.

[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.840]
And as Rod Roddy would say, the price is right, okay?

[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.060]
So go over and check them all out at Toyota of Hollywood.

[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.840]
They'll treat you with velvet gloves, man.

[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.200]
They'll give you a great personal service.

[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:39.800]
No pressure.

[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.300]
No games.

[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:40.880]
No gimmicks.

[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.740]
Just great prices, great value, and the best in award-winning service.

[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.200]
Always waiting for you at Toyota of Hollywood.

[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.440]
That's what's made them number one.

[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.420]
You'll find them on 441 right between Taft and Sheridan Streets in Hollywood.

[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.320]
You tell Patrick Murray, my good friends over there, that Uncle Neil sent you by for a

[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.160]
hell of a deal at Toyota of Hollywood.

[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:34.320]
I am just wasted in cloud.

[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:43.400]
I am just space out and down.

[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.400]
I'll hold on to street.

[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.840]
Please bring me around.

[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.520]
I'm wasted in cloud.

[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.860]
It's hard to believe.

[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.720]
Got a thing in my mind.

[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.200]
I do what you want.

[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.980]
My face is just blank.

[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.520]
All of the time.

[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:27.320]
I am just wasted in cloud.

[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:36.100]
I am just space out and down.

[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:45.120]
You could call me an emotional guy.

[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:49.460]
I am just space out and down.

[00:22:58.700 --> 00:22:59.980]
Okay, so we got to worry.

[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.380]
This is a double-headed man, but it just started 7 o'clock.

[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:07.300]
What the question is, in a 7-in-a-game, when is the 7th inning stretch?

[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.360]
That's important because Gilbert is going to have to know what is saying.

[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.540]
Take me out to the ball game.

[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.520]
We have to get a lot of these things straightened out.

[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.580]
I have another Donald Trump one.

[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.940]
I know we played that one at the beginning called Donald Tycoon to the tune of Rocky Raccoon.

[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.920]
I am tempted to play it right now, but I won't.

[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:24.840]
Are you still there?

[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:25.880]
Yeah, wow.

[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.080]
I know.

[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.540]
I stuck with it through about four different chances.

[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.900]
They were assuming that you were busy.

[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:31.660]
That's incredible.

[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.460]
Not too many people would do that.

[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:38.220]
Well, the last few drinks with Fleetwood Groover, we were camping out about two weeks ago.

[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:38.680]
Groovy.

[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.420]
We were talking about a white sail that was coming up.

[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.940]
And besides that, how are you talking about?

[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:50.100]
We were looking for some clippers to put those little nails of the gerbils.

[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.120]
Cute.

[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.720]
Is this what I've had you hold all this time waiting for?

[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:54.820]
Yeah, because we're in the same team.

[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:58.920]
Don't attack the new program director in Coast 97 until he at least gets here.

[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.620]
You ask him, he's into gerbils.

[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.100]
Okay.

[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.160]
1040 at WIOD, we have an opening in day one in Broward now.

[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:10.420]
751 WIOD in day five to four WIOD in Broward.

[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:11.940]
Oh, excuse me.

[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.180]
Hello.

[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:12.700]
Hello.

[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:14.140]
WIOD.

[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:14.780]
Hi.

[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:15.520]
Yeah.

[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:16.300]
Yeah.

[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.200]
What do you want?

[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.800]
I just want to talk to the WIOD.

[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:21.360]
WIOD, what do you want?

[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:22.660]
Hold on.

[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:23.860]
WIOD.

[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.120]
Hello.

[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:25.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:26.360]
Mobile.

[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:27.640]
Dale, yes, mobile.

[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.460]
I can hear that ringing sound.

[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.940]
Yes, the Miracle Game tonight starts at nine.

[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.480]
And at the double header, I just got to do this.

[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.260]
What?

[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.220]
AM or PM?

[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.360]
The 9 PM, 9 PM and each one is going to be 11 innings.

[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:41.720]
Okay.

[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.200]
So it'll be a little bit of a draw.

[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.320]
Oh, yeah, the couple don't cry that if we played enough innings, you might score a couple of runs.

[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:46.800]
There you go.

[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.400]
Maybe they're waiting for enough people to show up to start.

[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:49.800]
Yeah.

[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:54.900]
I think they're having a waiting for a quorum before they start the game.

[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:55.300]
Right.

[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.600]
So that's why they're waiting for nine if they don't get it.

[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.300]
We're going to have a lot of people there, sir, even though you won't be there.

[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.240]
Let me ask you something.

[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:01.620]
Yes.

[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.680]
You notice when I said, even though you would be there, you didn't say, oh, yes, I will.

[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.160]
See, I know your time.

[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:07.680]
You're right.

[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.200]
Absolutely.

[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.720]
It looks like a 20-pooper.

[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.460]
Rick and Puts.

[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.840]
Is the English translation of that Rick and Dick?

[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.360]
By the way, you know, he said something the other day.

[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.840]
What are you getting all panicky about?

[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.220]
He said his name was Richard.

[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.860]
I was driving home and he said his real name, Rick O'Reilly, is Richard.

[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.040]
And I was thinking, of course, a lot of people whose name is Richard.

[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:27.920]
They're called Dick.

[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.080]
Now, if we called him by his name and he still had Puts with him as a sidekick,

[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.080]
that would be, I think, maybe a little bit too much, even for this audience.

[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.180]
Well, I don't know.

[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.340]
I think they could handle it.

[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.880]
Have a nice day.

[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.460]
Have a nice day.

[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.120]
1042, am I right?

[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.060]
Just their name?

[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.980]
Hey, listen, we can't change people's names to suit a bunch of old parts up in Washington.

[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.680]
Our paranoid and hostile and psychotic, right?

[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.060]
You're damn straight.

[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.240]
Well, we have an opening in a date county 751 WIOD.

[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.760]
We're having a great time until Bill Cosford gets here at noon.

[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.280]
Hopefully, when I will have a little food from Wayne to pacify him.

[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.200]
Cosford's always better when you show something in his mouth.

[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.300]
Poor Lauderdale.

[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:04.960]
Hi.

[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:05.480]
Yeah.

[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.440]
I'll be attending the game tonight.

[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:08.300]
Outstanding.

[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:09.460]
Starts at midnight.

[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.020]
No, it's like, I believe it's around 7 o'clock.

[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:12.680]
7 p.m.

[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.820]
Don't accept any wooden nickels.

[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.580]
Don't listen to any of these O'Jahm provocateurs.

[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.600]
These are all promoters for the dogs or something.

[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:20.760]
Don't pay any attention.

[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.180]
The game starts at 7 o'clock and we're going to have a gigantic crowd.

[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.040]
I want everyone to bring banner that say,

[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.760]
Hire a super Dave and Mystery.

[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:28.300]
Okay.

[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.880]
We have an opening in there.

[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.360]
So help me, God, if he shows up, see I didn't know who that was.

[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.320]
Did you hear who that was?

[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:34.360]
You aren't paying any attention.

[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.460]
That was that slime ball, super Dave, okay?

[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.300]
And I'm going to tell you something right now.

[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.100]
If he shows up, his ass is getting tossed right out.

[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:42.920]
Trust me.

[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.760]
And will I fat-rich there to make sure of it?

[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:47.920]
1043 WIOD.

[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.460]
Oh, Neil, please.

[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.680]
I mean, is that chronic when you just can't get rid of somebody that's a pan in the ass?

[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.940]
They just won't go away, sir.

[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.120]
Is that chronic or what?

[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:55.560]
That's it.

[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:55.940]
That's it.

[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.940]
That's the epitome of being chronic.

[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.620]
It thrust my ass a little bit.

[00:26:59.660 --> 00:26:59.980]
Exactly.

[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:01.660]
Neil, please.

[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.420]
What's going on, Harry?

[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:03.380]
I'm here.

[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.300]
I'm doing it.

[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.000]
Gilbert.

[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:06.640]
Gilbert sings.

[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:07.260]
Yes.

[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.000]
Come on, Neil.

[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:08.920]
Come on, what?

[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.100]
Gilbert two steps.

[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:11.660]
Oh, geez.

[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.200]
Are we going to do a request again?

[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.320]
We only got a limited amount of time here, sir.

[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.500]
We've only got a short amount of time.

[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.980]
We got a very important guest coming at noon alleged.

[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.880]
I'm just, I'm killing a little time to find it, okay?

[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:24.420]
Oh, okay.

[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.560]
Can I just sit here and understand?

[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.080]
No, because I found it.

[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.160]
I just found it.

[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.640]
Have a nice forever, you're even.

[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.320]
Now, put you on hold for what?

[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:33.160]
Gilbert.

[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.440]
Did anybody ever tell you you were a little bit pushy?

[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:36.320]
No.

[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.300]
Well, guess what?

[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:38.220]
What?

[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:38.820]
You are.

[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:45.880]
The singing sensation of the 90s radio legend and talk show groupie, Gilbert, sings for you.

[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:46.580]
Wow, wow.

[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.320]
Get out, I get out.

[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:55.240]
Bloody woman, walking down the street, bloody woman, the kind I like to meet.

[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.020]
It's Gilbert's magic from A to Z.

[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.200]
Wild thing.

[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.480]
You make my heart sing.

[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.320]
You make everything gloomy, wild thing.

[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.520]
You get every record ever recorded from the animals to the zombies.

[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.320]
Who could forget this timeless classic?

[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:16.680]
These foods are made for walking, and that's just what they'll do.

[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:21.040]
One of these tasty foods are gonna walk all over you.

[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.040]
And the song that said America's romantic heart on fire.

[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:30.460]
Strangers and the night, exchanging glances, strangers and the night.

[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.180]
They're all sung just for you by Gilbert.

[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.180]
Every song ever written, every song ever recorded.

[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.760]
Interpreted just for you by the golden throat himself, Gilbert.

[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.880]
Love me, tender love me, too.

[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.600]
Planned out man, love, saying woman.

[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.140]

Order today for operators who are standing by to take your order now.

[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.180]
This record collection is not available in stores.

[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.440]
They wouldn't have it.

[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.640]
Call the number flashing on your screen.

[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.600]

[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.500]
That's 1-800 Gilbert's C-R-O-A-K-S.

[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.700]

[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.440]
45.

[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.420]
Take me up to the ball game.

[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.680]
Take me up to the crowd.

[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.580]
Buy me some peanut and crack.

[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.340]
Remember, if you want it right, it's got to be Gilco.

[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.020]
You said it. Don't say it again.

[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.580]
10-46 and W.I.D.

[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.180]
It's this little preview of what to be hearing at the ballgame tonight.

[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.340]
Probably have a little stirring pre-game speech by Alan J.

[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.200]
Thank you.

[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:47.980]
Thank you.

[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:54.720]
Thank you.

[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:06.520]
Thank you.

[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:08.780]
Thank you.

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.320]

[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.360]
Thank you.

[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:26.780]

[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:26.780]

[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:26.780]

[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:26.780]

[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:27.140]
Thank you.

[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:27.160]
Thank you.

[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:27.920]
Thank you.

[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:27.920]

[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:28.300]
Thank you.

[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:31.880]
Thank you.

[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:32.980]
Thank you.

[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:35.780]
Thank you.

[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:37.920]
Thank you.

[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:38.940]
Thank you.

[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:39.080]

[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:39.080]

[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:39.080]

[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:39.080]

[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:39.120]

[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:39.120]

[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:39.120]

[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:39.120]

[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:39.140]

[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:39.140]

[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:39.140]

[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:39.140]

[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:39.140]

[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:39.240]

[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.340]
I'm Alton from Alton Road.

[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:41.760]
Who?

[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.140]
Mike Spindell.

[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.180]
Oh, please.

[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:46.600]
Mike Spindell.

[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.240]
Nick Siet.

[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.840]
Does he still have that trivia show?

[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.060]
One of the stations down here.

[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:51.860]
Mike Spindell.

[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.500]
Well, he was on weekends on FTL, but I don't know what's going to happen.

[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.280]
It'll probably be out with the laundry over there.

[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.560]
If anybody trying to pick an FTL and day counting together,

[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.240]
because they're sting those like...

[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:03.520]
They're stingable.

[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.140]
You could do better by wrapping your finger in your pop-up toaster

[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.820]
and standing outside and screaming loud like Lee Fowler

[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.640]
could have a bigger audience in the studio.

[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.640]
There are industries disaster.

[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.500]
They're almost as big of a joke as QAM, but not quite.

[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.820]
Maybe when you're on vacation, cranking film for you instead of...

[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:21.320]
Possibly.

[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.000]
Possibly.

[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.500]
I do want to mention G Michael McCay will be filling in the first day I'm going on a Friday.

[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.340]
And then Stan will be here for part of the time.

[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.280]
And then some others.

[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:33.340]
I do want to also mention that Joey will not be among those filling in officially.

[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.260]
Trust me.

[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.520]
Neil, doesn't...

[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.380]
Go to the bank on it.

[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.000]
Doesn't a guy from 10 or 2 in Saris have no job in town?

[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.580]
I mean, one day working in Rays Station during a week is not going to make a living for him.

[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:43.980]
I mean, that's ridiculous.

[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.840]
Why don't you go back to Buffalo?

[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:46.940]
I mean, I...

[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.920]
He tries to be anonymous driving that truck, you know, that big purple truck.

[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.280]
He was horrible on she, Neil when he's on she...

[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.020]
We have to discuss that creature, sir.

[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.480]
We have to discuss the...

[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.000]
No, just mention...

[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.940]
Have a little respect for the dead.

[00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:58.780]
No, I just want to know.

[00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.800]
I just want to thank you.

[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.340]
I got a card from you, the other thing, the mill.

[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.340]
With a picture you're saying now is, no more fans.

[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.300]
This now, I just want to thank you for the card.

[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:07.500]
Where'd you get that from?

[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.420]
In the mail from Rays Station.

[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.280]
Yeah, sure.

[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.640]
I'm serious, I'll show you.

[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:12.640]
You're dreaming.

[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.300]
No, I'll read it to you right now.

[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.000]
Okay.

[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.160]
You don't want to really hear it, do you?

[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:18.660]
Why is it something personal?

[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:19.720]
No, no.

[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:20.540]
It's just...

[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.760]
Unless one of my friends played a joke, but I don't think so.

[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:23.300]
What does it say?

[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.760]
It says from, you know, WRT Rays, you're Steve to my number one fan.

[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.060]
Thanks for listening to my show every day.

[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.900]
No, I would never write that.

[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.180]
Well, where do I get it from?

[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.980]
Who's picture is it, Alex Ben?

[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:37.480]
Your picture.

[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:38.440]
My picture?

[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.440]
So we'll picture yourself without the bird.

[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.440]
And what languages are written in Hebrew?

[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:43.620]
No, not Hebrew.

[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.080]
WRT 610, trunk radio.

[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.000]
Oh, that's not us.

[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:47.620]
No?

[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:48.960]
Have a nice day, pal.

[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:49.440]
All right, thanks.

[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.480]
We're going to help you get that.

[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:54.700]
Are you sending pictures out in the programming office without my knowledge and forging my signature?

[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.440]
Oh, boy.

[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.700]
Oh, boy.

[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.600]
These people in there look out for that man.

[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.200]
I'll tell you, don't ever drop the soap when they're around.

[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:07.700]
We have an open line in Dade County, 751 coast and one in Broward, 524.

[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:08.600]
They're both ringing.

[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.040]
Look at that.

[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:09.740]
WIOD.

[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.860]
Guns and roses, rural aros and it sucks.

[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:13.840]
Okay, pal.

[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.800]
Just looks straight down.

[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:15.580]
WIOD.

[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:16.600]
All right.

[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.300]
Hold on.

[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:18.380]
Okay.

[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:19.360]
What was that?

[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.140]
Are you there?

[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:20.740]
Yeah.

[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.940]
Well, hold on a second.

[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.840]
Don't get panicky and surly with me, sir.

[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:24.660]
WIOD.

[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.160]
Yeah, let the call Chris at the beach back.

[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:26.800]
Well, hold on.

[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.780]
It will give you the opportunity.

[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:32.020]
Sir, after we do a very important commercial break here on 610, WIOD,

[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.120]
you can see where your signature can never be your own.

[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.100]
Yeah.

[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:35.620]
Yeah.

[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:36.060]
Yeah.

[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:36.660]
Yeah.

[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:37.580]
Yeah.

[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:38.460]
Yeah.

[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:45.000]
It's pretty nice to see Chuck Meyer in here again talking baseball and at 10.51 at WIOD.

[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.500]
You see any time the pirates win, man.

[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.400]
He's in here like a flash after they lose about 3.4 and a row.

[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.940]
All of a sudden you couldn't find him with a magnifying glass.

[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:52.960]
But that's all right.

[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.260]
When Steve Blas starts tonight, you'll be sorry.

[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.060]
Anyway, we're going to take a call from Hollywood, I guess, hey?

[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.160]
Yeah, near how you done.

[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:00.640]
Okay.

[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.960]
Let's make a summary to ask you about 5, 6 weeks ago you were talking about the who.

[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.680]
You said they had some song.

[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.620]
There was about two aside.

[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.760]
You never talked more about it.

[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:10.300]

[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.580]
You have any idea what I'm talking about?

[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:12.320]
Yeah.

[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.460]
Well, I want to know what song you were talking about.

[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.240]
What song I was talking about?

[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.000]
It's a...

[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.200]
Oh, I don't remember the name of the album.

[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.420]
It's an old, old album.

[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.320]
It's all that's morbid, depressing stuff.

[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.400]
And there's one song in there.

[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.360]
I can't...

[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.340]
Somebody will call it and tell you.

[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:25.060]
Okay.

[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.600]
By the way, the rest are going to win the World Series this year.

[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:28.260]
Really?

[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:28.620]
Yeah.

[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:29.600]
Well, good luck to you.

[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:32.480]
Somebody's well, just called it all off the way things are going now.

[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.240]
All right.

[00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.320]
Just have a forfeit.

[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.820]
Yeah, I got one other question for you.

[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:35.980]
Yeah.

[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.460]
Yeah, I was the latest you heard on that.

[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.160]
There's a wild.

[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:39.920]
On what?

[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.140]
On Liz Wilde, number her.

[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:42.660]
Liz Wilde.

[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:42.880]
Yeah.

[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:43.400]
From She?

[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:43.860]
Yeah.

[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.280]
I don't know.

[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.800]
I don't think she's given any more interviews.

[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:47.320]
I know that.

[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.420]
Now, I used to work there.

[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.560]
And she?

[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.060]
Yeah.

[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.360]
Oh, my God.

[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.660]
Now, what do you sound so depressed?

[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:55.320]
Wow.

[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.840]
There's a pretty ugly scene over there.

[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.240]
Woo!

[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.940]
Did you suggest you're not having a dinner?

[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.180]
In Tonegly, every chase you up and down the hall with a hammer?

[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:01.660]
Which one?

[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:02.400]
Tonegly.

[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.320]
The daughter.

[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.080]
Really, with a hammer, huh?

[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.560]
Well, we'll find out.

[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.080]
We'll get answers to all of your questions, sir, because that's what we're here for.

[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:09.500]
All right.

[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:09.940]
Okay.

[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:10.440]
Have a good life.

[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.840]
See, now I put it together.

[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.740]
I want to know the song about suicide, and he used to work at Chi.

[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:15.920]
It all kind of fits together.

[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:21.200]
We have two openings in Broward, which is a shocking, I think everybody's at a school,

[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.380]
and I don't care what Marvin says.

[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:27.300]
In Broward 524WYOD, he knows the name of the album?

[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.120]
See, I told you.

[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:28.700]
Dear Field.

[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:29.760]
Hey, how you doing now?

[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.920]
We're mostly the people in Dear Field are suicidal, especially if you're under the age of 100, like this color.

[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.100]
Well, you know, one or two of us.

[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.400]
The name of the album is...

[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.460]
It's from the movie, The Quadraphineal.

[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.420]
Quadraphineal, that's the one.

[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.060]
It's a great album, but it is very modern.

[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.620]
No, more morbid, and there's one cut on there, man.

[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:47.660]
I can't think of the name of it.

[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.880]
It's something like Steeley Dan.

[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:49.680]
Are we out of gas?

[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:50.820]
Something like that.

[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:51.140]
I'm not.

[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:51.940]
It's real depressing.

[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.300]
Hey, I sent you a shirt a little while ago.

[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:55.860]
Yes.

[00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:02.160]
But I sent you a double X, and I thought I heard you say the other day that you're down to a felt little like 18, you said?

[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.520]
No, I'm not 18.

[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.840]
Tire is 16, sir.

[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:06.680]
16.

[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:07.500]
18.

[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.620]
You're practically a ballerina now.

[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:10.460]
Yes, Cloth.

[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:11.680]
That's good.

[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.980]
So, the next shirt...

[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:13.420]
Very tight.

[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:13.740]
What?

[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.560]
I should send you the next shirt.

[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:16.580]
I should send you, like, a heart.

[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:17.720]
What was it?

[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:18.780]
Excuse me?

[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.420]
What was it?

[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:23.420]
Well, I sent you two, but I sent you one with a whale on it.

[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.580]
A whale on it?

[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:26.900]
Yeah.

[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:27.720]
What was it?

[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.960]
Like a Debbie Ellis t-shirt?

[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:29.660]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:30.960]
No, it was on the front and the back.

[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.920]
I don't recall getting that.

[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.960]
Well, it was kind of like...

[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.380]
You know, you have like...

[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.880]
All kinds of thieves, I think.

[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:38.540]
I know it.

[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.660]
And we have people that sign my name, forge my name to stuff here.

[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.620]
I'm beginning to find out what the hell's going on here.

[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.720]
Well, it's good, because it was kind of a company shirt, and the company's not mine, so it doesn't matter that you didn't get it.

[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.100]
Good.

[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.140]
Anyways, double X, so I'll send you a, like, a large one.

[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.440]
I'm going to, like, triple X.

[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.160]
Seriously, what size will fit you, I want?

[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.200]
As in Debbie does Donald's stuff like that.

[00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.780]
Large, just a regular large.

[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:00.080]
Oh, that one.

[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.980]
Regular normal person size on the...

[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.100]
Oh, and you know something else?

[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.060]
What else?

[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:09.400]
In reference to last week, the deadhead they called in and said they're all Smith's sucks.

[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:10.880]
Well, we have a few of those.

[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.200]
Well, people with no taste.

[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:13.720]
Any would taste in their nostril.

[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.340]
Well, I happen to be a deadhead.

[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:21.880]
And anybody that is a deadhead that will say something like that about arrow Smith, you know, obviously isn't all the way there yet.

[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.880]
They get some space to grow.

[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.960]
They have Gary Garcia disease, that's their problem.

[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.120]
Well, I like the dead, and I also like arrow Smith.

[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:29.660]
All right.

[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.340]
And nobody's perfect.

[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.360]
And the album that I fell in love with was...

[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.740]
And Stan would say half a meat loaf is better than on it.

[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.880]
The Dream On album that...

[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.520]
Outstanding.

[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.260]
Mama Kinn.

[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:40.820]
Yep.

[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:41.640]
That's the song.

[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:42.380]
Okay.

[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:43.640]
Hey, Neil, talk to you later.

[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.520]
Have a good day.

[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.580]
Glacix, it will probably be like a three horse field.

[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:47.660]
Well, it's an ever great day.

[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:48.560]
Let me tell you something.

[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:49.260]
Quickly, quickly.

[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:53.020]
I have to leave here every 14 years.

[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.520]
I've left to go to work.

[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.960]
Worrying about whether you'll be here when I get back.

[00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.780]
This year, I don't have to worry.

[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:00.440]
I'll be here.

[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:00.960]
Thank God.

[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:01.280]
Okay.

[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:05.580]
By the way, speaking of racing, I spoke to a great gentleman in the business.

[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.520]
Phil Saltsman yesterday.

[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.440]
Big news from New York.

[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.620]
Marshall Cassidy has been put out to pasture.

[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.660]
He's going to become a racing official of some kind.

[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.980]
Any kind will be good for us.

[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:19.740]
And Tom Durkin will become the New York Racing announcer at Belmont,

[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:23.320]
an aqueduct in Saratoga, starting August 29th.

[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.720]
So thank God for good news.

[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:25.180]
Okay.

[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.380]
Here's Henry Barrow, who says thank God for good booze.

[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.500]
Newstalk Radio 610.

[00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:32.540]
All that to find is space for bed.

[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:38.740]
The host calls him sleep and all his tears.

[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.340]
He wants to say hi to be well-peded.

[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:52.680]
But normally seems like that is keen by making her sign a greener shoe.

[00:39:52.680 --> 00:40:02.700]
So cheer man, concoctured flat, to make Donald look rather silly.

[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:08.960]
To total columnist friends, the whole ugly end.

[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.680]
And I don't think this is really...

[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:18.740]
Oh, Donald was smart, deal of makingses are.

[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:23.240]
I have fun, the life that was trying to hear.

[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:37.620]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[00:40:52.860 --> 00:41:07.600]
I sort of was drunk at lunch and I was like you know playing beer-��zoned girl driving

[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:07.600]

[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.560]
And I don't need some imagery by the way.

[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.380]
You can't go.

[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.820]
Come on down it.

[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.440]
Well, do do do do do.

[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:18.220]
Come on down it.

[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.380]
Well, do do do do do.

[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.840]
I saw it down it must have the soul.

[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.640]
I love it.

[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.460]
It's 11-08 at W.I.D.

[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.880]
I know you don't like it, but that's too bad, because I don't really care.

[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:35.080]
Bill Costford, the movie I'm even from The Herald is just a real rock contour and general

[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.500]
pain in the ass will be here at noon.

[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:41.040]
And Wayne Arnold will be here at 12.30 with some food so we can keep him occupied.

[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.660]
Don't have to listen too much of his BS.

[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.720]
And then Rick and Puts will be along at 2 this afternoon.

[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.360]
What do we got?

[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.060]
We've got a schedule here somewhere we hope.

[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:48.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:50.900]
Sunny and Joe on Sports Talk at 6.05.

[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:54.200]
And another great performance by the Yankees.

[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.280]
Man, are they doing it?

[00:41:55.300 --> 00:42:00.360]
How the Red Sox and the Yankees 7.35 from Fenway to night, okay?

[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.100]
We do have an open light and brown.

[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:05.440]
Oh, don't forget the ballgame in Pompodo, a beach tonight, weather permitting, double

[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.540]
headers starting at 7 o'clock and you get two games for the price of none.

[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.080]
If you mention the arrangers at the gate, okay, they'll let you in free all your degenerates,

[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.980]
W.I.O.D., nice talking to you.

[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.320]
Probably another order.

[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.460]
A West Palm Beach.

[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.240]
I'll come you don't like Mr. Radio.

[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:20.960]
What?

[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.380]
I'll come you don't like Mr. Radio.

[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:26.820]
For the same reason I don't like you, get off my phone, you creep as somebody would

[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:30.320]
say who's no longer here and who's on the verge of losing his job, W.I.O.D.

[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.960]
Hey, good morning, Mr. Neal Rogers.

[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:36.380]
Yes, sir, Mr. Mr. Mr. Mungata.

[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.420]
That's what they call me.

[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.740]
What are we going to do with Mr. Super Dave and Mr. Radio with those two?

[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.020]
Where are we going to bury them?

[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.780]
We're going to kick their tupuses out of the stadium tonight.

[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:47.300]
Exactly.

[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.000]
Oh, so help me.

[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.300]
Super Dave's here because I've seen him at, I've seen his fat face in body at Pompodo.

[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.300]
We don't want it in here.

[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:55.080]
He shows up there.

[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.120]
We don't want him there.

[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.000]
Just find something else to do, okay?

[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.520]
We're sick and tired of people imposing their presence when they're not the desired.

[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:06.340]
Instead of a 17th impression, we'll have a 17th inning kickoff.

[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:07.000]
Okay.

[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.900]
We'll kick their butt right out of the stadium, okay?

[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:11.460]
Right to the old gold post, say?

[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.820]
Can I be a part of that, Joe?

[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:13.960]
Right to the crossbar.

[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:17.380]
I'm ready to roll.

[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.040]
I'm like an SNM caller here.

[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.240]
We ought to play the marquee desan for this guy.

[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:21.660]
Hey.

[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.840]
I just want to play these cards.

[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:26.160]
Do you realize that we, uh-oh, new kids on a block, so you're going ahead.

[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.940]
Why is this video in black and white?

[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.180]
I want to say this.

[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.060]
Let's discuss that with cost for it.

[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:32.780]
I'm going to put that down.

[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:33.960]
Hey, it's a three-mooring subject.

[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.320]
But this blood, these are too crafty.

[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.900]
Shoot it on, oh, it's not in black and white.

[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:38.920]
It's a bit like, crap.

[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.000]
Part of it's in black and white.

[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:40.580]
Over that crap.

[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:41.280]
Look at which part.

[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.120]
Over that crap that Alex made it was doing.

[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:43.700]
What was it called?

[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:44.880]
Mailbox movies?

[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:45.880]
Where do you have black lines?

[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.480]
Letterbox, letterbox format, which is the most depressing and annoying way.

[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.500]
And it looks like it's all squeezed in, you know, like it's squoes.

[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.640]
Is that like, like somebody squos it too hard?

[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.620]
God almighty.

[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.360]
What was I thinking about when I first saw this group?

[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:01.540]
I must have been, my vision must have been real bad.

[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.900]
You must have been playing with the dog.

[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.020]
Is this the hooter man?

[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:05.480]
Yeah.

[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.400]
Oh, Melvin recognized you.

[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.420]
I wasn't paying any attention.

[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.280]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.000]
I was thinking about those lyrics to that Johnny Mathis record when he was singing something

[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.560]
about Low Over Jordan.

[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:15.120]
There you go.

[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.940]
I didn't get a chance to talk Dirty with Melvin today.

[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:17.720]
Oh, really?

[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.280]
Well, that's why he looks a little depressed.

[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.700]
He easily picked a little deprived.

[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.140]
He easily picked something.

[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.680]
He easily picks up and we compare worse stories, you know?

[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.080]
Yeah.

[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.780]
But anyway, we're having Jordan going to be in here on Thursday.

[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:31.220]
Who do you?

[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.700]
From New Kids on the Block.

[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:33.940]
Oh, no.

[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:35.740]
Don't lower yourself, dude.

[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:36.920]
Don't lower myself?

[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.460]
Boy, I got a good line for that.

[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.520]
That's what Johnny Mathis was saying.

[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.240]
Something about Low Over Jordan.

[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.260]
Yeah, but remember, you're going to have a piece of the rock for that.

[00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:45.940]
Yeah?

[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:50.660]
Well, I'm not going to touch any of your materials here because you're a filthy disgusting,

[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.720]
perverted sick, grotesque person.

[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:53.760]
And we hope you call soon.

[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:54.660]
But you like me.

[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:55.440]
Have a nice day.

[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.700]
It's 11 past 11 at W-I-O-D, where we're sick as hell and that's why you listen.

[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.920]
We have an open line in Broward, 524 at W-I-O-D.

[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:06.660]
That is an interesting thing.

[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:07.960]
This video starts out.

[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.400]
I never really paid that much attention before, but I'm paying a lot closer attention now.

[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:12.840]
It starts out in black and white.

[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.680]
And then it like blossoms into full color.

[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.980]
And then there are like portions of it that are in black and white.

[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.240]
Like I said, only moments ago, I think this is pretty clever and pretty, uh,

[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:25.700]
intellectual for real as opposed to pseudo-intellectual.

[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.020]
And don't forget one of the great suits in the history of South Florida, Bill Cosfiddle

[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:33.740]
allegedly be here at noon and we'll believe it when we see it.

[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:34.160]
Miami.

[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:35.080]
Hello, Neil.

[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:35.520]
Yeah.

[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:36.380]
How you doing today?

[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:36.760]
OK.

[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:38.200]
Hey, somebody was calling before.

[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.820]
Swazies restaurant is Mall Howland Drive Cafe.

[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:41.080]
Right.

[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:41.400]
That's right.

[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.400]
It's in the water, uh, ways.

[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:44.160]
It's right there.

[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.520]
But it's got nothing to do with the unicorn.

[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.960]
It just happens to be close by.

[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:47.440]
That's right.

[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:50.200]
Well, that's that guy was in the ballpark out about it.

[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:50.800]
Yeah, right.

[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.900]
And my cup, Jay, the ballpark.

[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.160]
How 96 is sitting in, huh?

[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:56.140]
Well, I guess he's not from Palo 96 anymore.

[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.840]
Well, no from FPL most recently.

[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:58.340]
That's right.

[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.600]
And you guys have something common.

[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:01.940]
I took both your pictures.

[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:03.800]
Oh, is that all we have in common?

[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:04.960]
Well, we don't want to go into that.

[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.840]
Well, you guys both probably like arosness.

[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:07.800]
Yeah.

[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.960]
And you know how I feel about arosness, but I don't want to go into that.

[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.040]
And new kids on the board.

[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:12.240]
New kids.

[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.980]
My kids got some of those new kids cards.

[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.300]
I'll start saving you the double.

[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:16.180]
What is that?

[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.380]
No, they baseball cards.

[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.080]
Are they coming to pack?

[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:18.980]
Now they've got the new.

[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:19.940]
Are you serious?

[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.780]
Where the God, he came home with two yesterday.

[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.200]
He came home with two.

[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.340]
What cards are the group?

[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:25.960]
For the kids.

[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.460]
Well, yeah, they're personal friends about that.

[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:28.000]
Oh, that's OK.

[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.060]
The packs of cards.

[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.340]
And the gun was pretty good, too.

[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:30.840]
Uh-huh.

[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:32.400]
Oh, I used to love that boy.

[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.060]
When I was a kid and got those baseball cards,

[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:35.260]
I'd get like 20 packs.

[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.780]
And I would feel compelled because people were starving somewhere

[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:39.060]
in the world.

[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:41.900]
I feel compelled to chew every watt of food.

[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:42.320]
Beetle piece.

[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:43.340]
Your dentist like it.

[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.260]
We're going to, even some of the people are in color.

[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.720]
And the boy, this is interesting, the way they photograph.

[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:48.660]
Yeah, quick photography.

[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.220]
And some of the people in the background are black and white.

[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:52.120]
This is fantastic.

[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.540]
See, I'm getting into this arty, crafty stuff.

[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:55.700]
You know how they do that, don't you?

[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:56.000]
No.

[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.080]
Well, it's filmed in black and white.

[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:00.420]
And then they just add in the color.

[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.220]
Oh, they bring Ted Turner in.

[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:02.840]
Ted Turner.

[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:04.460]
You colorize new kids on a block.

[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.300]
Ted, you should be ashamed of yourself.

[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:07.960]
Can my two-year-old say hello to you?

[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.660]
When they're going to start showing those brave games

[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.320]
in black and white, they're really going to do it.

[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.220]
Yes, go right ahead.

[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.020]
No, you're too scared.

[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:15.200]
OK, good one.

[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:15.900]
You like that?

[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:16.460]
Excellent.

[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.960]
You know, talking about douche bags,

[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.240]
that lead story today, that guy that shook that kid,

[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:21.700]
I think we should get him like somewhere

[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:22.860]
and also some stones.

[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:26.240]
Yeah, with the Super Dave and Mr. Radio, all in the same bus.

[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:28.280]
A Greyhound.

[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:29.320]
I'll see you later, Neil.

[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.260]
Be closing.

[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.000]
Yes.

[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.420]
Tarosmiths, they don't really suck.

[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.620]
They're just not great.

[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:34.060]
Bye.

[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:35.780]
What does he know?

[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:36.600]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:37.860]
How you doing?

[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:38.440]
OK.

[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:39.800]
Done right.

[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:40.960]
OK, son, right?

[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:41.400]
Hold on.

[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.240]
We have an open line in date, one in Palm Beach,

[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:46.780]
two on the board at the same time, not a very happy site.

[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.860]
These are not happy moments at W-Y-O-D

[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:50.160]
because the video just ended.

[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:55.100]
A 751-9463-751-W-Y-O-D in Palm Beach.

[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.060]
I see, all of this, I guess these guys are passing

[00:47:58.060 --> 00:47:59.920]
now, right, because the assumptions is much hotter.

[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.860]
They're like only making about four million a day of peace now,

[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:03.900]
instead of like 20 million.

[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:05.800]
See, I can't relate to that.

[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.500]
I don't understand what that's all about.

[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.300]
A Palm Beach W-Y-O-D in your mobile.

[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:10.880]
Neil.

[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.220]
You're on the air right now.

[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:13.900]
Can't touch your sony.

[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.080]
What's happening?

[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:15.900]
What?

[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.000]
I want to be a part of your six shows.

[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:18.500]
Yeah.

[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.200]
Yeah, you got a good start on this, Carl Sir.

[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:21.920]
Yeah.

[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:22.540]
How about you?

[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.120]
Hello, baby.

[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.240]
How about getting your head out of the muffler, pal?

[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.500]
Yeah, I'm trying it.

[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.440]
It's right in there, though.

[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.040]
OK.

[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:29.560]
Wow.

[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:33.300]
That was a caller for Rick and a mutt.

[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.160]
It's 1115 at W-Y-O-D.

[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:38.280]
We have an opening in Palm Beach where Mr. Music just hung up

[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:39.820]
655 W-Y-O-D.

[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.400]
I just, I can't get over those two slabs, man.

[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:44.780]
Mr. Radio and Super Dave keep calling back

[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:45.520]
and calling back.

[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.260]
It's like there are people like that I've

[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.440]
mentioned it many times before.

[00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:50.080]
There are people who will just not go away.

[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.260]
You tell them I can't stand you.

[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:51.840]
You're disgusting.

[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:52.660]
You wrote tests.

[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:53.740]
You're obnoxious.

[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:54.880]
We hate you like poison.

[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:55.940]
The audience wants you up.

[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.440]
Hold it.

[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.480]
The boogie board spot just came on.

[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.200]
It's 1115 at W-Y-O-D.

[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:03.880]
We need somebody to fill this space.

[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.480]
Hi, Uncle Neil.

[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:06.240]
Hi, do you want, buddy?

[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:08.420]
Guess who?

[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.520]
How many guesses do I get?

[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:12.240]
Mori, boogie.

[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.900]
Yeah, I'll be very happy to fill and play a spot when you're gone.

[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:16.800]
Mori, boogie.

[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:17.660]
Yeah, well you're, Gilbert.

[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:19.720]
Well, you got two chances of that, Gilbert.

[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:20.500]
What's that?

[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:22.240]
None and much less than none.

[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:22.980]
Oh, because.

[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:25.000]
Yeah, oh because, yeah.

[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:25.820]
Yeah, because.

[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.880]
You're not about as much chance of filling in on my vacation

[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.620]
as blind Mike has doing morning drive on QAM.

[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.060]
Oh, I say.

[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:32.560]
Yeah.

[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:34.000]
Well, I guess, yeah.

[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:35.380]
Gilbert, tonight's the big night, eh?

[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:36.060]
Yeah, I know.

[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:36.500]
I'm looking.

[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.640]
Now, when are we going to have you sing and take me out

[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.140]
to the ball game?

[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:40.380]
Because there's seven in the games.

[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.480]
And there will be no seventh inning stretch.

[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.360]
We'll have to do it like in the middle of the fifth inning.

[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.980]
Well, I'll be my happy to.

[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:46.960]
The fifth inning's ready to go.

[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.200]
Yeah, you're ready to go.

[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:48.380]
You're ready to go.

[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:48.860]
You're ready to go.

[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:49.980]
Good.

[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.480]
And I guess you probably heard me on Sunday, right?

[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:53.620]
No, I sure didn't.

[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:54.840]
You mean you didn't hear the, uh, how?

[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.380]
No, I sure did not, Gilbert.

[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.080]
When my life gets that empty that I have to listen to WKAT on Sunday,

[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.600]
we'll be the day I pull the trigger as Roy Rogers.

[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.220]
Oh, because he, he out invited you over to it.

[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:07.140]
So, he said, he said, yeah, good luck.

[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:07.520]
I'll be so.

[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:08.680]
Good luck to him, Gilbert.

[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:09.800]
I, I say.

[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:10.700]
We don't slum around.

[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:12.220]
It's sub, substandard.

[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.900]
The douchebag radio station is like the cat, OK?

[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:15.360]
Yeah.

[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.000]
Got it, Gilbert?

[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.140]
Yeah, it's like a real looking flood on the outside.

[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.300]
Well, we'll see you tonight, Gilbert.

[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:21.680]
Yeah, and also next Wednesday.

[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.840]
We'll see you tonight, Gilbert.

[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:23.200]
OK.

[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:23.760]
OK.

[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.160]
Like I said, for just a moment or two there,

[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:27.980]
to fill that spot.

[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:31.280]
But briefly, it's 1117 and WIOD.

[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.420]
We have one opening indeed.

[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.000]
WIOD.

[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:35.920]
Anyone?

[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:36.980]
What is it?

[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:37.680]
Hello?

[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:38.340]
Yes.

[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:40.820]
Got a, a version of your song for you here.

[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.180]
Hold on, and we have an opening in Bokinon,

[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:44.280]
and everybody will be happy.

[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:46.020]
2789463.

[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:47.120]
What song is it?

[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:48.860]
Matt Hissin-Eyed.

[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:51.000]
Oh, he didn't even wait.

[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:52.800]
Hold on a second.

[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:54.180]
Are you there?

[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.020]
And he hangs up.

[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.740]
Man, then I'll use your, whoever that was,

[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:02.060]
you are so dumb that it's frightening, OK?

[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:06.040]
You are so dumb that you make like, I'm

[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.020]
trying to think of a real dumb.

[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:10.360]
You make Bart Simpson seem like Albert Einstein and drag.

[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:11.100]
OK, sir?

[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.480]
I was going to put you on over just a second,

[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.360]
let you show your ass to the whole world, do your thing,

[00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:18.280]
and he puts it on in the middle,

[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:21.000]
and I'm trying to talk to this idiot and he's gone.

[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.460]
And you can hear some little baby wailing

[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:26.620]
in the background pathetic, that little child

[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:29.200]
in the background here has got a higher IQ than you do.

[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.880]
That was so weak, so bad.

[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.140]
But we enjoyed it.

[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:33.960]
WIOD.

[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:34.940]
I'll fill your opening.

[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:36.640]
Cute.

[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.000]
It's 1118 in WIOD.

[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:40.020]
Now, see, that was a pervert.

[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:40.840]
I know who that was.

[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:41.580]
You know who that was?

[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:42.440]
That was that pervert.

[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.020]
I know him.

[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:44.640]
He's a real screamer.

[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.160]
Anyway, let's talk about char-hut right now.

[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:48.620]
If you're in the mood for a great lunch,

[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:50.200]
char-hut is the place to find it.

[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.340]
Lunch that is, if you live in Oral Springs,

[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.380]
Coconut Creek, North Lauderdale, Marguerite,

[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.440]
or any of the other seven location areas,

[00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:58.000]
that's kind of a little awkward, right?

[00:51:58.300 --> 00:51:59.780]
If you live by char-hut anywhere,

[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:02.160]
you got to get over there and try some of the new things

[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:02.740]
on the menu.

[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.940]
For example, well, these aren't new things on the menu,

[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:05.820]
but it's a new deal.

[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:09.020]
It's the Neil Deal at all seven soft Florida char-huts,

[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:12.560]
two of their delicious Buffalo-style jumbo hot dogs,

[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.080]
those gigantic weenies cooked on the grilled char-b-world,

[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.000]
just the way you like them with your choice

[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.220]
of fresh delicious toppings,

[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.800]
and a large soft drink, just $2.99.

[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.740]
That's the Neil Deal every day at char-hut.

[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:25.620]
And if you're watching the wait like some of us are,

[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.320]
then I'll have a 296 calorie quarter pound chicken breast.

[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:31.980]
For those of you who have to kind of watch what you eat,

[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:34.100]
that they cook on the grill exactly the way you like it,

[00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:34.920]
like they cook everything,

[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.820]
or if that's not enough, if you're a real big fresher,

[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:40.740]
they introduce the half pound double chicken breast

[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:42.340]
to like more breast for lunch, okay?

[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.220]
It is just unbelievable, and it's waiting for you only.

[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:49.260]
At char-hut also brand new, the new kids combo, kids 12 and under,

[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:52.600]
get a hot dog or hamburger, fry in a small drink for half price.

[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:55.700]
At char-hut right now, the best ingredients cooked exactly

[00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:57.180]
the way you want it fresh on the grill,

[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:58.360]
you can't beat it with a stick.

[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:00.420]
At char-hut open every morning,

[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:03.120]
early at 10.30 for lunch dinner and great late night snacks,

[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.700]
inexpensive, the food is delicious,

[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:07.760]
and sure beats the hell out of those fast food joints, okay?

[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.520]
Seven, stop floating char-huts, you'll find them in Tamarack.

[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:12.740]
Sunrise Hollywood, Davey Oakland Park Miami,

[00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:17.060]
and the newest char-hut at 306 North State Road 7 in Margate.

[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:22.440]
-♪ Six in, up to fire, young man. -♪

[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.940]
I don't believe you, Johnny Dark, you are a shameless person, okay?

[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.740]
Go back and play some of that good stuff.

[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.420]
They are playing good music over there, it's frightening,

[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.600]
not as good as we do, but pretty damn close.

[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:36.020]
Do not play this yet.

[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:38.500]
Next move.

[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.300]
Excuse me.

[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.400]
Is that a bugle in your chains?

[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.080]
Why, yes, it is.

[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:55.040]
Get in.

[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.560]
I know flight of the bumblebee.

[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.840]
And I bet you know, Splitwood grew her too.

[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:11.380]
It's 11.22 at WIOD, where we're just having one hell of a day.

[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.940]
Hey, don't forget the ballgame is tonight.

[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:16.360]
I keep reminding you that because God only knows we hope we have a few people show up.

[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.160]
At Pompatome Municipal Stadium, 7 o'clock,

[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:20.900]
double header will be there for the first game,

[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:25.140]
A, between the Miracle and the West Palm Beach Expo's.

[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.900]
And just mention my name at the door or Gilbert's name,

[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:30.500]
and you get in free in the first 750 fans who show up,

[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:33.760]
get a free Miracle pennant, and a coupon good for one free dinner

[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.960]
when you buy one at either wings plus location.

[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:38.760]
Sounds incredible.

[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:39.540]
Miami.

[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:40.540]
Yeah, now.

[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:42.980]
I have to call Steve a lady, a bunch of knuckleheads.

[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:43.540]
Yeah.

[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:44.500]
And I'll see you tonight.

[00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:45.020]
OK.

[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:45.880]
Good one.

[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:46.740]
Kendall.

[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:48.300]
Oh, Neil.

[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:48.780]
Yeah.

[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.000]
Hey, do I have a spire report?

[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:50.940]
OK, sir.

[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.720]
Rocks guy to fight over in Texas.

[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:53.400]
No way.

[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.040]
Yeah.

[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:54.940]
You're joking.

[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:55.740]
I swear to God.

[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:56.440]
For what?

[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:57.500]
I don't know.

[00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:59.120]
Usual stuff I would imagine.

[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:00.820]
I'm not just in self-centered.

[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:01.380]
OK.

[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:02.960]
But I'll check it out.

[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.420]
What's the chances of him being hired now at WIOD

[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:10.000]
with maybe two to six making an adolescent trio there?

[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:10.740]
None.

[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:13.040]
What a schmendrick.

[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:14.060]
OK, there's the call.

[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:15.560]
You can do four hours on that, guys.

[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:17.860]
Those guys are doing great.

[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:18.700]
Leave them alone.

[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:19.960]
OK, cut the crap.

[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:21.440]
Nick just brought me in.

[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:22.340]
What magazine is this?

[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:24.100]
Oh, the Center Tammant Magazine, the one

[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:26.620]
with that ugly grotesque Arnold Schwarzenegger on the cover.

[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:27.140]
He may.

[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:30.180]
Let's talk with Bill Cosper about Arnold Schwarzenegger

[00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:30.980]
for about two seconds.

[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.120]
Oh, is he just, he represent, he's

[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.180]
like a step above.

[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:39.360]
And I do say above our Sylvester Stallone, just one step.

[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.120]
And that Maria Schreiber boy, she

[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:44.200]
must have seen something that the rest of us can't see.

[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:47.820]
Because boy, what, what a, what a couple that is, huh?

[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:50.580]
Here's a broad with no chin at all.

[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:51.400]
Maria Schreiber.

[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.820]
She's attractive, except like down to the lip,

[00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:55.480]
but under the lip, there's like a chin missing.

[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.360]
And here's him, who's like, it was probably good in the sack,

[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:02.580]
but other than that, I mean, what a great intellectual coupling.

[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.500]
But anyway, inside this magazine,

[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:07.100]
here's the thing on New Kids on the Books.

[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:09.700]
It says, some people are calling New Kids on the Block,

[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.260]
the hottest pop property since the Beatles, who,

[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:14.300]
three of New Kids books are on the paperback best

[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:17.160]
analyst, the lives and loves of the New Kids on the Book.

[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:18.140]
And there's a picture here.

[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.480]
And of course, the four on the left, they can all drop dead.

[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:22.320]
But there's Jordan wearing a, what do you, like,

[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.460]
coveralls with nothing underneath?

[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:26.360]
Isn't that disgusting?

[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:28.480]
And Johnny Mathes is thinking something

[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.680]
about lowering over Jordan.

[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.000]
New Kids on the Block, a block scrapbook,

[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.260]
and the other one is New Kids on the Block period.

[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:36.200]
That's it.

[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:38.540]
No, not with a period after block.

[00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:41.600]
Well, it's kind of interesting.

[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:43.700]
Nick, not too sunny, but save the picture.

[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.160]
25 past 11 at WIOD.

[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:47.560]
Let's go to Coke and a Creek.

[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:48.260]
Deal.

[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:50.940]
Now that we've discovered MTV, man, life is worth living.

[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:51.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.700]
Neil, listen to your buddy from Rochester, New York.

[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:54.260]
All right.

[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:55.260]
Now we're talking.

[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.160]
Let's talk some shwagos white hats.

[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:57.920]
I had some.

[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.220]
I just got back yesterday.

[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:00.960]
Let's talk about Vick and herbs.

[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:02.880]
Let's talk about some real stuff.

[00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:04.000]
And Dona Bob's.

[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:05.420]
Let's talk about the.

[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:07.020]
The chocolate almanac cream.

[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:07.800]
Oh, yeah.

[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.360]
And sense of recards.

[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:11.800]
Oh, wait, did they really change an Emadonna Bob?

[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:13.100]
They're original.

[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.740]
Oh, I mean, the one out didn't the bright.

[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:15.220]
Yeah.

[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:16.260]
I don't know.

[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:16.860]
I didn't go there.

[00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:18.000]
I went to the one that the lake.

[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.580]
I didn't realize it was there anymore.

[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:22.000]
But he's still that's your regional.

[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.060]
That's what Don Barbedo started many, many.

[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:25.040]
Oh, I understand that.

[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.300]
But I used to live in Brighton, sir.

[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:28.860]
I went to school right next door to Dona Bob's in Brighton.

[00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:31.200]
I've spent, I don't know how many days they're just shoveling

[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.360]
that stuff down my throat.

[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:32.820]
Yeah.

[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:37.680]
Well, then he sold that wants to, uh, I'm

[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.080]
trying to think.

[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.900]
The guy from Wendy's who's destroying that place.

[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:41.440]
He's.

[00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:42.480]
Oh, it's terrible.

[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:43.340]
I don't go there anymore.

[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:43.660]
I know.

[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:44.000]
He's just.

[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:44.800]
I don't know that one.

[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.340]
But I go to one now down that sea breeze.

[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:48.980]
That's a.

[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.820]
Does he still, they're still doing it there, huh?

[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:51.840]
You can't believe it.

[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:54.660]
It's such a, it's such a dreary place.

[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:58.900]
The big thing is they go down by the marina there where the boats are

[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:02.020]
and the bugs are and that's the big deal for the whole weekend there.

[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:02.200]
Yeah.

[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:02.460]
Wow.

[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:02.940]
That's good.

[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.360]
They bring a few lilacs down here and sniff the flowers.

[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:06.020]
Yeah.

[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.820]
You know, we, you, uh, you were very nice this year when we, uh, I invite

[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:13.160]
you to the Rochester picnic at the T. Y. Park, you know,

[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:17.300]
every Tuesday, but we won't be having that till next.

[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:18.380]
Well, what did he know was very nice.

[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.200]
I didn't show up.

[00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:19.620]
I don't.

[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:23.500]
Yeah, well, next year, and then we start after Thanksgiving, uh, next year

[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.940]
and every other Tuesday, we're going to have the picnic there.

[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000]
And here you and mom are always invited.

[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:28.280]
Great.

[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.780]
Well, we're going to show up on these times.

[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:30.080]
Yeah.

[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.420]
And I'll have to listen to you.

[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:32.660]
Want me to bring it back to.

[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:33.900]
No, no, sir.

[00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:37.040]
I can't, I, I approached you at it, but I can't to mess around with those things

[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:37.580]
right now.

[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.700]
And if I could, Wayne Arles got him already a ship's in from.

[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:41.760]
Oh, yeah, that's right.

[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:45.100]
Yeah, you told me that the place on 125th Street, that's a seven.

[00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:45.820]
You bet you.

[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.380]
Did you know Pete Pavia?

[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:48.140]
No, sir.

[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:49.080]
I know Joe Pavia.

[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:49.720]
He drives it.

[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:50.180]
Pumpano.

[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:50.580]
Yeah.

[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:54.520]
No, the Pete was the NBA referee in basketball.

[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:54.920]
No.

[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.020]
He had a setback.

[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.060]
No, I knew less Harrison.

[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:01.680]
Oh, who did that Jack Harrison and Mugsy Solomon and met your uncle.

[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:02.100]
Right.

[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:02.500]
Right.

[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:03.620]
That's right.

[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:04.820]
It wasn't.

[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:06.980]
Let me tell you, he was one classy guy.

[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:07.540]
Yes, sir.

[00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:08.760]
And he never stole a freight train.

[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:09.720]
No, he was great.

[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:13.040]
You know, I was going to tell you that Pete Pavia and Nick on 11th, they're going to have

[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:16.160]
a banquet form that guy has in remission.

[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:18.560]
And he's been, you know, pretty sick.

[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:22.720]
But listen, everybody watches their like, oh, the red wings are the Niel.

[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:23.900]
The red wings are in first place.

[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:24.880]
They're doing it.

[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:25.360]
Oh, yeah.

[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:26.200]
They're doing it.

[00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:27.240]
I'm going to take up an internationally.

[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:28.360]
Forget the Cubs.

[00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:29.300]
I'm going to the internationally.

[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:32.080]
Listen, I, I, I got something for you.

[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:35.180]
I got a shirt and I was trying to send it here.

[00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:36.020]
I got an accident.

[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:37.940]
I got her pretty bad, but I'm okay now.

[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:38.420]
Okay.

[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:41.860]
I got one of those shirts that you know, wearing a house.

[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:43.640]
I got the Cubs shirt for you.

[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:43.840]
Great.

[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:45.960]
I can't wear it in the John.

[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:47.280]
Get, bring it down.

[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:48.780]
I'll wear it in the bathroom.

[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:52.580]
You want me to bring it down there at the station or anything that makes you happy?

[00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:54.300]
Where's the nervous convenient for?

[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.760]
I want to tell you, let me, Rochester.

[00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.900]
I go up there because I got grandkids and my mother-in-law there.

[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:03.560]
Otherwise, it's just a big waste of time.

[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.020]
The weather wasn't 84.

[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:08.880]
The weather stinks and the lilac smell and just not what you can't go back.

[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:09.880]
Well, listen, have a great day.

[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:13.900]
Listen, nice talking to you sometimes when I got a kid to you, but I just call the station

[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.100]
and give you some, or come down.

[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.260]
Give me some what?

[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:18.520]
Neil?

[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.060]
What?

[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:20.780]
I'll bring this shirt down.

[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.260]
I come down.

[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:21.460]
Great.

[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:22.700]
We'll look forward to it.

[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:22.980]
All right.

[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:23.440]
Thank you.

[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:23.680]

[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.500]
Have a nice day.

[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.440]
Get that other call.

[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.280]
Okay.

[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:26.780]
Okay.

[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:28.640]
Oh, thank God for call waiting.

[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:31.140]
29 past 11 at WIOD.

[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.660]
We got two open lines in Broward.

[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.300]
I can't imagine why.

[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:35.040]
524, White Hot.

[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:36.880]
524 at WIOD.

[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.720]
Boy, this is a pressure building now.

[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.160]
Bill Cosper is supposed to show up.

[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:41.700]
He won't be here.

[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:42.600]
No way.

[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.300]
Sunrise.

[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:44.460]
Hi, Neil.

[01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:44.920]
How are you?

[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:45.520]
Okay.

[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:47.620]
I'm calling today to talk to you about golf.

[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:48.620]
Do you know anything about it?

[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:49.220]
No, sir.

[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:51.340]
Thanks for the mic, and here is your show.

[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.520]
I have no interest in golf.

[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.580]
I know nothing about it.

[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:54.160]
It's boring.

[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:54.860]
It's tedious.

[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:55.440]
It's clever.

[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.140]
It's terminal.

[01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:57.160]
Call me here.

[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:57.740]
He's a golf.

[01:00:58.260 --> 01:00:58.740]
What is it?

[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:02.560]
I understand that coming from you, but I have to, I need a favor from you.

[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.260]
But I'm my good friend Todd Monahan.

[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.280]
Just shot a 79 Sunday on a golf course.

[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.040]
At a boy, Todd, you're a great American.

[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.060]
At a way to go, man.

[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:13.660]
And I'd also like to call a 3-back for a 26-hole.

[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.080]
No, that was for 18.

[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:15.640]
All right.

[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.840]
And I'd like to call Bill, Todd, a douchebag.

[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:18.440]
Great.

[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:21.020]
And Todd, can I please have another ass lipid?

[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:21.920]
Have a good day, Neil.

[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:22.400]
Okay.

[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:23.940]
Good one.

[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.360]
I wonder if that was figurative or literal.

[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.480]
Well, we'll find out, I guess.

[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.480]
1129 at WIOD.

[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.340]
We have two opens.

[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.020]
Broward's been a little strange today.

[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.740]
A little spotty, a little spotty.

[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.560]
The way things have been going lately, we don't expect this kind of thing.

[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.660]
524, WIOD is that Broward number.

[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:43.260]
Chris, they're all waiting for cuss for the show up, then they're all going to disappear.

[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:44.040]
WIOD.

[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.460]
Back to talk to Neil, please.

[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.340]
Sure, hold on.

[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.600]
You'll be on about the three hours.

[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:49.380]
WIOD.

[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:50.320]
Neil, please.

[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.320]
Speaking.

[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:52.920]
I can talk to Neil, please.

[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:54.380]
See, I know it.

[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:59.160]
I just always have a thing that I knew which ones are ready and which ones are full of crap.

[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:00.240]
WIOD.

[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.640]
I want to talk to Neil.

[01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:02.260]
Yeah, sure.

[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:03.060]
WIOD.

[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:05.580]
Broward.

[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:05.900]
Yeah.

[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:07.400]
What do you want?

[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.340]
Who is it?

[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:08.860]
Adam.

[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:10.440]
Adam from where?

[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.420]
From Water Hill, not Marimond.

[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:13.260]
Oh, that Adam.

[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:14.060]
Okay, hold on Adam.

[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:14.780]
WIOD.

[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:15.680]
Is this car talk?

[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:16.740]
What is it?

[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:17.440]
Car talk, yeah.

[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.460]
I literally probably was my 89 books wagon.

[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:20.820]
Yeah.

[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.560]
Who's this Ted Bundy?

[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.280]
Parking in Lakeland would be a good place to park it right out in front of ABC Lickers.

[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:28.000]
Uh-huh.

[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.100]
And there's little bugger all come out and he'll get a start to run up for you.

[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:31.680]
Uh-huh.

[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:33.180]
Yeah.

[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.500]
Little, uh, little guy.

[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:36.560]
Not bugger.

[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:37.500]
Booger?

[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.720]
Is that on the corner of the...

[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:39.420]
Oh, jeez.

[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:40.300]
Now I'm really depressed.

[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:43.140]
Here's, uh, what's his name Van Halen?

[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.200]
Oh, he makes me sick.

[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.500]
Is that Eddie Lee Roth?

[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:47.260]
David, yeah, Eddie Lee Roth.

[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.300]
David Lee Roth.

[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.140]
Oh, jeez.

[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.460]
I can hear his grotesque.

[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:52.120]
Here's, uh, man.

[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:54.900]
Do we have to get started with David Lee Roth again like we did on Seda?

[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:55.820]
I hate him.

[01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:57.560]
I just, he makes me want a barf.

[01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:58.200]
Uh-huh.

[01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:58.880]
And he's, uh...

[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.880]
Stop living, stop breathing forever.

[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.560]
Stop the compared arrow Smith through.

[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:03.920]
I beg your pardon?

[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:06.900]
Did you say arrow Smith and the same breath with David Lee Rothser?

[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.200]
Yeah, arrow Smith.

[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.020]
That's a short call.

[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.780]
And it's 1131 at WYOD.

[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:13.100]
We have an opening in Broward again.

[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.660]
Broward seems to be like a little cantankerist today, aren't they?

[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:18.160]
Or is it just the canker part we're looking at?

[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:18.980]
WYOD.

[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.580]
I hope it pours tonight.

[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:21.140]
Do you?

[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:21.660]
Yeah.

[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:22.300]
Why is that?

[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:23.280]
It's your stiff.

[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.200]
Oh, okay.

[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:24.980]
You're a stiff.

[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.600]
But you're out there listening, pal.

[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:28.780]
Mr. Stiff, you wish you were a stiff.

[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:30.980]
WYOD.

[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:31.900]
Yeah, Neil?

[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:32.420]
Yeah.

[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.180]
How come, uh, I call the other day from Detroit, I call it.

[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.460]
Oh, no wonder we shouldn't take any calls from Broward.

[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.300]
Speaking of stiff, man, everybody's call from Broward is in the bag.

[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.640]
You call from Detroit the other day?

[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.580]
Yeah, and they wouldn't take the quite call.

[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:46.000]
I call it pop-up.

[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:46.780]
Of course not.

[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.180]
We don't want to talk to a bunch of boring people in Detroit.

[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:50.160]
It's a crappy place.

[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.200]
Well, that's not it.

[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:54.280]
We've got enough of them here, sir.

[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:55.220]
I thought you liked Detroit.

[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.900]
From years ago, yeah, it was great.

[01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:58.620]
Okay.

[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.080]
Before pre-derriate, it's okay, pre-67.

[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:02.300]
Anyway.

[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:07.020]
So, that's, uh, I was just, uh, you always say call at one and I try to call.

[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:08.280]
Well, hey, don't look at me.

[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:09.340]
I didn't answer the phone.

[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.540]
But blame Melvin for it.

[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:10.940]
He's the one.

[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:11.460]
Oh, no.

[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.100]
The thing was the operator went even let the call go through.

[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.180]
She says, they're not.

[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.660]
She said they don't take call at calls on their line.

[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:18.200]
And I said, what?

[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.860]
Well, do you tell that operator?

[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:21.620]
She can spin on this.

[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.220]
Okay, tell her to drop it.

[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:23.920]
Okay, I'll do that.

[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:24.400]
Okay.

[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:24.940]
Okay, thanks.

[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:27.540]
What a jerk that ran the operator too.

[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.020]
1132 at WIOD, we have an opening and brow art.

[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:31.600]
Brow art.

[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.000]
Brow art.

[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.260]
We keep sending like a stuck record, like something in the time, like in the Holland tunnel.

[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:36.360]
WIOD.

[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:38.880]
Inbrow art.

[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:39.280]
See?

[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.500]
I mean, that was for, wait a minute.

[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:40.800]
Hello.

[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:42.760]
Hello.

[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:44.940]
Nice talking to you.

[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:45.640]
Sunrise.

[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:48.240]
Why are we staying on the brow line?

[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.940]
Why do you keep putting all these brow art people on?

[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:50.840]
There's nobody there anyway.

[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.100]
WIOD, crankline.

[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:52.760]
See?

[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.260]
Let's go to a paring.

[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:54.580]
Is that...

[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:57.280]
Hey, now we've got some real people here in paring.

[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.840]
Let's start Cubs Baseball.

[01:04:59.080 --> 01:04:59.480]
Let's not.

[01:04:59.660 --> 01:04:59.940]
Hold on.

[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:00.840]
WIOD.

[01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:02.580]
Crankline.

[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:03.840]
IOD.

[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:07.380]
Hello.

[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:09.420]
What is it?

[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:10.820]
Yeah, I should speak with Neil, please.

[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.000]
Well, how come there was like that long pause?

[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:13.580]
I don't know.

[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.040]
What was it?

[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:14.440]
It was strange.

[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:15.260]
Yeah.

[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:16.140]
What was it?

[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.240]
Is that on your end?

[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.060]
I'd probably heard it in my head.

[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:19.240]
Yeah.

[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:19.660]
Check your end.

[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:20.040]
Hold on.

[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:20.900]
WIOD.

[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.340]
Yeah, for Neil, please.

[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.020]
No, we'll...

[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:23.540]
You're a mobile?

[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:24.060]
Yeah.

[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.100]
Well, let's get right to it, sir.

[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:25.580]
Okay.

[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:26.340]
What do you want?

[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:27.620]
What's your story?

[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:31.420]
Oh, Neil, I just call him and get directions for an Arnold's little one back.

[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.640]
Can I just get him and he's eating there?

[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:33.460]
No, you didn't.

[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:34.820]
You could never have gotten there that fast.

[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:35.240]
Hi, kid.

[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:36.740]
It was delicious.

[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:40.960]
But I had your favorite white hots and some of those castle burgers or whatever.

[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:41.480]
Ray.

[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:42.700]
They were fantastic.

[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:43.780]
Neely Burgers.

[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:45.240]
Well, castle burgers.

[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.380]
Well, Neely Burgers.

[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:46.680]
There you go.

[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:47.460]
Arnold Burgers.

[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:52.800]
But I am stuffed to the gill and I'm hidden down towards the Kindle now.

[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:53.760]
For what?

[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.880]
Well, I'm doing business.

[01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:57.520]
I'm one of those sweetly sales mv.

[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:58.320]
Oh, good.

[01:05:58.620 --> 01:05:58.960]
Good.

[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.180]
I wish I had the card out to play for you, but right now I don't have the energy.

[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:03.760]
It's been a very stressful morning.

[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:07.800]
Well, when you get a chance, play the 95's, so I'm for you because I had to fight that hell.

[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:08.940]
I just drive down here today.

[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:09.260]
Okay.

[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:10.540]
Well, I'm glad you did see Wayne.

[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:11.080]
Was he there?

[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:11.940]
Yeah, he was there.

[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:12.620]
What do you say?

[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.120]
Actually, he served me.

[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:16.540]
Well, Arnold served you personal?

[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:17.000]
Yeah.

[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:17.680]
Wow.

[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:19.700]
Did you hear your call?

[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:20.600]
Yeah.

[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:23.500]
He must have been pretty impressed, huh?

[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:24.060]
Yeah.

[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:25.800]
He was the glad that you gave directions.

[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:26.980]
Well, that's great.

[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.240]
You're saying that advertising is saying all the same tips, sir.

[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:29.920]
All right.

[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:30.480]
Come on.

[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:31.080]
Okay.

[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.500]
Don't call us twice again, ever.

[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:33.260]
W-I-O-D.

[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:34.300]
Oh, Neil?

[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:34.820]
Yeah.

[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:35.980]
Speak up.

[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:36.500]
Speak up.

[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:36.820]
Come on.

[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:37.820]
Are you doing today, man?

[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:38.160]
Okay.

[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:38.940]
Hold on, pal.

[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:40.100]
W-I-O-D.

[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:41.720]
Hold on.

[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:42.200]
Hold on.

[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:42.820]
Yeah, okay.

[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.080]
How you doing today?

[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:44.460]
Great.

[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:46.840]
I want to ask you something.

[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:47.280]
I'll bet.

[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:48.320]
What do you think of that?

[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.320]
The answer, whatever it is, the answer is no.

[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:53.080]
Let me ask you something, dude.

[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:54.200]
When you go home, do you go home?

[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.900]
What, why did you say, do I want?

[01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:01.800]
When you go home, do you take 79th all the way to the express army to 95th?

[01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.280]
Well, what other way would I go?

[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:05.100]
Well, you can go far.

[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:06.000]
No, I take say, man.

[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.460]
I take say, man, I'm straight up here to like the, uh,

[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:09.060]
bay.

[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:10.340]
Okay?

[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:10.720]
Why?

[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:14.580]
When you take a quick ride, I take, I take off to like a place for steak, okay?

[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.820]
But when you go up there, I take a quick ride and I go fat and I just floor the vent.

[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.200]
I get up to about 135 miles an hour.

[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.340]
That's as fast as I go.

[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.460]
I'll say, well, why, why waste a,

[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:26.120]
Can you suppose to say you go like a bat out of hell?

[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:27.540]
No, I don't say that kind of thing on here.

[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:29.000]
Well, I don't say that kind of thing on here.

[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:33.960]
Anyway, what I'm trying to get at is, I was driving up 79th.

[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.060]
What the hell are you talking about?

[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:39.480]
I was driving up 79th.

[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:39.620]
Yeah.

[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:42.740]
And right at the railroad tracks there, just east of the bay.

[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:48.840]
Oh, speaking of the railroad tracks, I'm coming to work this morning and there were like two freight train cars, two cars.

[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:52.560]
And they screwed up the traffic, and people were getting exasperated.

[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.060]
The bars were down, you know, the railroad things.

[01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:02.480]
And people were going around them and this guy, he gets out in the middle of the street on the tracks with the two cars and it stops there.

[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:08.520]
And then he backs up, I mean, you people between the guy with the bridge up here who's a rear lia, who in the guy with the train,

[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:11.660]
You people ought to be just impealed and oil is.

[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:13.240]
Well, guess what's right by the railroad tracks?

[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.000]
You're the skewer.

[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.140]
Guess what's by the railroad tracks?

[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:16.460]
What?

[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.180]
They got this new billboard of you.

[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.600]
You're talking about sickly teeth.

[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.600]
Oh, no, not the one with the soap.

[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:25.060]
No, the new one?

[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:26.540]
On the new one?

[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.980]
Man, you guys, your teeth are, uh, on the old car.

[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:30.820]
My point is, uh, no.

[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:31.700]
Oh, no.

[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:32.800]
Man, I'm telling you.

[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:33.960]
Oh, geez.

[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.560]
You're talking about Steve.

[01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:36.340]
No, wait a minute.

[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:36.780]
Wait a minute.

[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:38.600]
I'm bisqin in 79th.

[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.940]
What the hell kind of a place is that?

[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:41.980]
Oh, that's an appropriate place to have a big mouth.

[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.020]
Well, all right.

[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:45.700]
So the railroad tracks are like two blocks up from there.

[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:47.740]
But I mean, what kind of an area is that for my billboard?

[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:48.540]
There's nobody in this.

[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:52.120]
Nobody who drives that area listens to this radio station, okay?

[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:53.100]
They can draw the metro.

[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.920]
All of them are all listening to radio and Moscow or something.

[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:55.920]
They're a bunch of Kamalistas.

[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.720]
I'm telling you, you should see.

[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.680]
Right by the immigration building, they're all the people

[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.480]
looking off the boat and see that billboard.

[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:02.160]
That's it.

[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.440]
And those teeth, man.

[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.020]
Those teeth.

[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.240]
Oh, geez.

[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:08.300]
They look like big kicklets and big, big pieces of the sidewalk.

[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.620]
Like an earthquake happening in your mouth or something.

[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.160]
They're all jagged and crooked.

[01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:15.440]
I tell you, or at the down this nightmare.

[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:16.140]
Wow.

[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:17.860]
It's really something to see.

[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.400]
Melvin sawd all he sees, like, puking in the air.

[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:22.260]
I figured they put it there so you could see it.

[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.380]
But I said, oh, maybe they don't know.

[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:25.200]
Well, I still have, I must be, I must be dynamite,

[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:26.260]
because I haven't noticed it.

[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:27.660]
Well, go straight on 79.

[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:28.360]
Don't turn it on.

[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:30.720]
Don't turn by where?

[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:31.820]
Well, that's right.

[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:32.340]
No, I don't.

[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:32.820]
Oh, I see.

[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:38.220]
In other words, it would be going west on 79.

[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:40.600]
See, I go, no, I, now I understand your question.

[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.040]
No, I go on the first three.

[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:43.720]
I go 80 first, because it's a much less travel.

[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.380]
Oh, going up 79, speed.

[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:46.460]
You got to have your head examined.

[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:47.580]
That's horrendous.

[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:48.600]
Well, you got bulletproof.

[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.200]
Oh, I know I don't mean that.

[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:51.640]
I'm just talking about the driving.

[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.260]
Man, there is so slow.

[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:55.960]
By the way, this video, this video by heart,

[01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:57.940]
all I want to do is, you would all over you,

[01:09:58.060 --> 01:09:59.540]
and that video is a killer.

[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.020]
That is sensational.

[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:04.220]
Well, let me say Steve Tyler and Mick Jagger

[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:06.640]
have nothing, can't hold a candle to you in that poster.

[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:07.400]
You damn right.

[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:08.140]
What a mouth.

[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:08.840]
Okay.

[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.160]
All right. Thanks for the warning.

[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.900]
22 till noon at WIOD, your incompetent station.

[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.360]
For the 90s, let's tell you about shells right now.

[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.440]
If we can, today is Tuesday.

[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.080]
Yeah.

[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:21.640]
You may not know it.

[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:24.680]
But today is the anniversary of the marquee desad's birth.

[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.960]
So I suggest we bake a birthday cake in his honor.

[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.600]
First, crack open a couple of eggs and separate them.

[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:32.680]
Search them right.

[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:34.320]
Then beat those yolks.

[01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:35.700]
Yeah, beat them good.

[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.980]
Then whip those egg whites until they're fluffy

[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:40.380]
and you're feeling good.

[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.780]
Flamat together with two cups of flour and a pinch of nutmeg.

[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:47.420]
Now take a sharp knife and slice up the cherries.

[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.420]
Really chop them.

[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:50.380]
Then let's crush some nuts.

[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:53.380]
Grind or pulp and dump the whole thing in the batter

[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:55.140]
and throw it in a blistery hot oven.

[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.060]
You bake it till it burns up.

[01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:00.860]
Then you eat your feet by get juved all over again.

[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:05.340]
Happy birthday, marquee desad.

[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.700]
Sometimes I feel myself.

[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.560]
1141 at WIOD.

[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.760]
You're a fun station for the 90s.

[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:21.620]
WFU in.

[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:24.080]
Let's go to Palm Beach.

[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:25.160]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:25.980]
Fun radio.

[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:27.100]
IOD where you want.

[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:27.480]
Yeah.

[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:28.240]
I love that.

[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.100]
And that was pretty good.

[01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:30.220]
That was pretty good.

[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.060]
Actually, I'm going to take that big job in Buffalo

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:34.320]
and you might be hired, sir.

[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.640]
15 hour at all the Kilbasa he can handle.

[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:42.340]
And a date with Paul Isle.

[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.560]
A date with Paul Isle?

[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:46.360]
I'll get back to you.

[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.420]
Wonderful, a wonderful liel of dreams.

[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:50.200]
So what's going on?

[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.680]
Well, we're having a great time.

[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:52.960]
Bill Cosford will be here at noon,

[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.280]
which ought to be pretty damn excited.

[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:54.900]
Yeah, right.

[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:56.580]
No, seriously, we got a lot of people out there

[01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:57.240]
into movies now.

[01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:58.300]
No, nothing about that.

[01:11:58.300 --> 01:11:59.340]
No, nothing about that.

[01:11:59.340 --> 01:11:59.720]
We got all the good stuff.

[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.020]
Because I got all those channels on my satellite

[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:03.180]
that I watch movies on.

[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:03.980]
So how are they?

[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:04.920]
Right?

[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:06.680]
No, a cost for it knows about movies.

[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:08.020]
It's fit into a...

[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:10.480]
Temple and room for the Soviet Army left over.

[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:11.900]
Robert Scott's grape stain.

[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:13.720]
Got it. Is he there yet?

[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.320]
No, he may ain't going to show up.

[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:16.640]
If he does show up, he'll be late.

[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:18.880]
I like to give him a piece of my...

[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:19.540]
Wait a minute, sir.

[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:22.040]
The juicy fruit spot is just coming on now on MTV.

[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:23.340]
Oh, gee.

[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:24.720]
Well, that's the end of my day.

[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:26.380]
I can't handle this, okay?

[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.160]
No wonder they want to ban MTV and Hellen Day.

[01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:31.320]
Amanda Pacemaker's law short circuit over there

[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.240]
if they saw any of this.

[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:34.060]
So what's this about you and Michael Jordan?

[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:35.220]
Oh, gee.

[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:35.780]
What is it?

[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.280]
What's this about you and Michael Jordan?

[01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:38.860]
No, not Michael Jordan, sir.

[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.140]
We stick with winners on this.

[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:43.380]
Okay. I told you the pistons would kick their ass tonight.

[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:44.660]
Oh, yeah. Well, yeah.

[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:46.100]
We had a last before Don concludes.

[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.440]
I was like, what was it? Like, almost 20 points in our last game.

[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:49.320]
What did 90...

[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:49.520]
Yes.

[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.200]
19 points.

[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:52.880]
That Portland was going to kick their ass.

[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.940]
Nah, I get Portland, are you?

[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:55.760]
Oh, you're even...

[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:56.200]
The cervical.

[01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:58.840]
The quail blazers get out of here.

[01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.820]
They're up in front.

[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:01.860]
They're a bogus bog club, sir.

[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:04.160]
Don't know about on a team with uniforms like that.

[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.620]
And speaking of that, did anybody see the college world series

[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:12.480]
getting this in the Citadel that grubby, grimy, greasy team that beat us here?

[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.640]
They beat Cal State Polarton.

[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:17.640]
Yeah, I was watching parts of that game.

[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:18.900]
What was it? 12 innings, I thought.

[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:21.600]
Yeah, they went 11 or 12 innings yesterday.

[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.860]
12 innings, I think, they won.

[01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.700]
8 to 7. It was just nail biting.

[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.080]
horrendous poorly played game.

[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:29.580]
And who won the LSU game?

[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:30.200]
I don't know.

[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:31.940]
When the LSU was there, like Skip Burmese?

[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:32.520]
Was that guy?

[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.160]
Yeah, and what Skip Burmese coached down here?

[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.780]
Yeah, a system coach for the Kings.

[01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:38.200]
Yes, sir, and a wonderful guy, and he could eat a good meal.

[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.660]
And it looks like he's eaten several since he lost all that weight.

[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:43.800]
So, once you know, I'm a trifecta.

[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.560]
I've called you from Dave Brower to now, Palm Beach County.

[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:48.280]
Not today.

[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:49.180]
No, I understand.

[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:50.480]
Like over a...

[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:51.720]
Oh, gee, Gremlins, too.

[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:52.540]
Here's the spot for it.

[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.100]
Don't you think Gremlins one was enough?

[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.120]
I liked it.

[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.420]
This one was pretty funny.

[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.080]
Well, I thought it was kind of cute.

[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:00.100]
But cost for it's going to rip it up and...

[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:00.480]
Yeah, you know.

[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:01.320]
He's going to rip everything.

[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:03.900]
Because, first of all, it's in English, which he doesn't like though.

[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:07.940]
Secondly, it was not made in Vienna, Austria, or somewhere like there.

[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:10.000]
So, he's going to rip the hell out of it, and they will not show it

[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.940]
at the International Film Festival in... in Can.

[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:13.960]
Yeah, now you want to know that?

[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:15.720]
That's his slogan. It's in the Can.

[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:17.820]
Ask, ask, cost for it about Ron.

[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:21.320]
And that's where I think he spends most of his time writing his reviews in the Can.

[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:21.900]
Right.

[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:22.980]
Ask him about what?

[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:27.380]
Ron, the movie Ron, with the Japanese director, Akira Kurosawa.

[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:28.900]
Oh, yeah, Akira Kurosawa.

[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:30.720]
So, man, you may say that.

[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:31.520]
That's his favorite.

[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.060]
He loves to say that over and over.

[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:33.920]
Yeah, I know he does.

[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:35.720]
Because that makes him sound like a real sued.

[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:40.220]
Yeah, he gave that four stars, and I stayed up at midnight and watched it on P.M.E.T.

[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:41.840]
because he said it was so good.

[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.400]
Yeah, anything with Akira Kurosawa, he just goes nuts over that.

[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:47.520]
Two hours and 40 minutes, Neil.

[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:47.960]
Yeah.

[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:48.900]
And it was a...

[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:49.640]
But I'll tell you one thing.

[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:51.060]
I'll tell you one thing. He loves this show though.

[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.260]
He's obsessed with the show.

[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.220]
You don't understand it, though.

[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.020]
Through Akira Kurosawa?

[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:54.420]
Yeah.

[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:55.140]
In concert.

[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:56.840]
He's obsessed with the show.

[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:58.140]
I mean, like...

[01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:59.840]
He's so far beyond just Neely.

[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.700]
I mean, he's like 20 stages beyond that.

[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:03.840]
He can't help himself, like the four tops.

[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.840]
Yeah, you tell Kurosawa that I said I was coconut smile and...

[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:08.420]
So...

[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:10.040]
See ya.

[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:10.500]
Okay.

[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:11.020]
Okay.

[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:12.800]
Good calls today, huh?

[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:13.780]
No?

[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:15.180]
1145.

[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:16.740]
What would you know about a good call?

[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:18.940]
You wouldn't know a good call if it bid you on a must-deaf.

[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:20.440]
We have an opening in Palm Beach.

[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:21.840]
655-Covac.

[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:23.800]
655-Eurny-Covac.

[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:24.520]
That's so marvelous.

[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:25.920]
It looks like the Erny-Covac.

[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:26.920]
Of course, he got killed.

[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:29.520]
Let's sit it out, please.

[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:30.060]
LSU.

[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:31.920]
So LSU lost.

[01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:34.340]
What a bad break.

[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:35.420]
I can't believe that.

[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:36.560]
Yeah, they weren't looking too good.

[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:37.420]
I saw a little bit of that.

[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:39.260]
Then, unfortunately, the Cup game came on.

[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:40.900]
And I watched some of that.

[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:41.600]
Not too much.

[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:46.320]
I didn't tape the game last night because I knew right from the beginning they looked flat and useless and useless.

[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.220]
You can just tell with them.

[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:49.900]
They just like they're going through the motions.

[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:54.140]
And then I saw the last 20s of the Metz game may be very...

[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:56.120]
See, it's not important that your team wins.

[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:58.360]
It's important that the Metz and the Yankees lose.

[01:15:59.060 --> 01:15:59.340]
Okay?

[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:00.620]
Just remember that slogan.

[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:01.780]
Are you young people who are listening?

[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.880]
It's not important that your team wins.

[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:06.520]
It's important that the Metz and the Yankees bite the bag.

[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.220]
And a little twerpy but Haroldson.

[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:10.420]
Man, what the hell is he going to do?

[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:11.260]
What is he going to do?

[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:12.400]
Light a fire under those guys?

[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:12.920]
They suck.

[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:13.960]
And a David Cohnhead?

[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:15.020]
Man!

[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:16.480]
Get cereal.

[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.700]
Against a bogus team like the Expose.

[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:21.420]
Let's go to Miami.

[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:21.880]
Hello.

[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:22.340]
Hello.

[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:23.060]
Yes, sir.

[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:23.980]
In you, I do it.

[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:24.420]
Wait.

[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:27.800]
Just going back, getting back to the flow of things.

[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:29.400]
You're getting back at us?

[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:29.860]
Yeah.

[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:32.960]
Well, I mean, I haven't listened to you guys in like about a month.

[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:33.660]
For what?

[01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:35.140]
You know, I've been...

[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:38.780]
I got a new job here and you know, it's been like really busy.

[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.020]
It's the first time that I'm sneaking a peek here.

[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:42.140]
You're sneaking a peek, huh?

[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:42.660]
Yeah.

[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:43.520]
What do you love?
