[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400]
Wow Marvin's right away Marvin finally came in. Thank you, but you're gonna like shine us again today

[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.200]
That's okay. So how are you? I'm great. I'm getting back on floor to time

[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.360]
Which is you know nobody cares that they don't care that I'm two hours off here

[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.680]
Yesterday when I woke up I woke up at 5 a.m. Which was was seven a.m

[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.180]
Right, okay, so now it's not been a little bit better, but you look great

[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.860]
You look a lot sexier today and a lot more comfortable than you did yesterday

[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.860]
I don't know why is that well, I don't know maybe meeting me for the first time and doing the four hours of

[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.300]
Neal Rogers for the first time. We had really just met yesterday

[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.880]
Right, last time last time we met you were sick. You said hello. Oh, I'm going to throw up and then you sort of

[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.140]
Left that said because it was like two days before I left for vacation and I was just you know

[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.140]
I really drug in here and

[00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.220]
I had to drive all the way back and I went to bed when I got home and I cut and you drove in cursing me all the way

[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.120]
Oh god, not at all. I want to collect my paycheck anyway

[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.020]
At least you had incentive I feel better about that

[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.940]
So stand major and I are sitting in for the vacation in Neal Rogers who

[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.480]
Boy, he's gone and he appears in the newspaper yesterday. Did you see the picture? I didn't as a matter of fact

[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.820]
I was surprised when Rick and son's talked about it because I don't get the son sent Noel anymore

[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.800]
I I was surprised that the length of the article

[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.240]
Because Neal

[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.160]
It's the mentions he wants to get rid of the pinheads as he calls them and it it warrants a

[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.740]
A two column or three column article in the son sent no

[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.040]
Well, Jack is a very big fan of Uncle Neal and a regular guest on the show so

[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.600]
Rick was right about his almost in session with relationship

[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.320]
Well, that's mostly mostly in radio anyway, but

[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.660]
So Neal's gonna make some minor adjustments. He said we'll have to figure it out when he comes back

[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.180]
Yeah, it really will be interesting because I remember when we worked out a wins he got on this

[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.580]
campaign about

[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.060]
The language thing again

[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.500]
I mean language Spanish English Spanish thing. Yeah, and that was basically the last big Neal Rogers campaign

[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.220]
Topic

[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.840]
So yeah, yeah, but that was right in the middle of doing all of the things that he does now

[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.220]
Well one good thing about Neal had doubts will and changed as well and everybody seems to hate to use the word copy

[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.480]
But if it works for Neal

[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.500]
I ran tell was quoted in the article saying well basically he sets the standard for what talk show hosts do

[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.180]
I was pretty much says yeah, I do what Neal does because it works and

[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.640]
That was pretty amusing, but so we'll have to see what happens when you come back by the way

[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.520]
We got phone lines open here this might take phone calls in the morning. I haven't heard any dizzy. We're not

[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.140]
I think he takes

[00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.500]
Everyone's very busy. He says he has a lot of things to do

[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.280]
Well, we sent a reporter up reporter from the herald coming in tomorrow sitting in with Mike one one carlo

[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.140]
Oh, is he coming in coming in coming in nearly also is that interesting? Well, that's great though

[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.360]
I mean for you and I work here. That's wonderful extra press doesn't hurt good press that press whatever

[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:25.080]
Both lines are open here folks and numbers in day 7619463 in Broward 524 W I O D

[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.900]
I O D and his focusing is history since you've gone

[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.540]
You've torn off half the numbers anyway, so that's gone from beach the number 655 W I O D

[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.600]
So give us a call this morning. So anybody else you want to drop a bomb on today?

[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.520]
No, but I would recommend that nobody unload the lawn

[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.300]
Anything connected with the lawn furniture or anything and a lighting

[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.520]
Do you believe that that's pretty sad? Wow

[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.100]
Well, they play golf out there in lightning storm

[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.980]
Not smart people on the course and fancy not smart people and

[00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.720]
Standing under a tree is also a big winner with a metal club in your hand

[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.980]
I can't think of anything worse. I mean that's a lightning robbing your hand

[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.680]
In the middle of the golf course and raise it up to the heavens and you've truly become a conductor

[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.340]
Yeah, lightning down here is pretty scary. Yeah pretty darn scary the power went out in my house twice

[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.600]
After a while everything was psychedelic everything was glowing the VCR the the LCDs on all the

[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.080]
All the clock the TV went off the TV went on it was nuts

[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.240]
So I couldn't watch anything. I started to watch the interview with the Dell Castro. Oh

[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.680]
Yeah, the interview the puff piece with Ted turn Dell needs to clean up a bit, you know

[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.520]
Is he still wearing the same fatigues? I think he's still wearing the same fatigues from the 50s

[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.680]
I absolutely think he's wearing the same fatigues

[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.320]
Needs to get you know a haircut in a shave

[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.100]
I've always wondered how he had his cigars checked out

[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.360]
You remember the story that the somebody was gonna put poison in one of his no even cigars

[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.780]
This was the CIA mafia plot. We just how they were going to get him

[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.340]
Now they're gonna get really poison in the cigar and so I've always wondered exactly how each

[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.840]
Individually wraps the guy that the Dell sticks in his mouth is checked out before he actually has an official cigar

[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.560]
I smoke her like a food taster

[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.040]
cigar smoker here. I think he has to

[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.160]
But anyway, it was interesting that Tanner was doing that this morning. Tanner was into this heavy mandela thing this morning

[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:31.680]
Yeah, I can because it's a big issue down here and a large portion of his audience are Latin and now

[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.240]
We're seeing also in the newspaper reports this morning. We're seeing interesting

[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.260]
opposition within the Cuban community now the Cuban community seems to be splitting on the mandela business

[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:52.360]
About five counties so we thought we were gonna have one big demonstration out of front

[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.980]
We're gonna end up having two big demonstrations a couple of counties

[00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.780]
I know her or cities. I should say Miami Miami Springs have come out and said

[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.040]
They will not support for sanction mandela's visit down here

[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:13.960]
We always seem to get in the news somewhere. He's been in major cities all over the country and Miami seems to always get negative

[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.840]
Yeah, well, he's addressing a session joined session of

[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.640]
Congress this morning and there's some people who are gonna either walk out or not show up

[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.160]
Boycott so you know his words the other day are

[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:36.460]
Kind of you know if he had a public relations man in New York City public relations person would be going out of the

[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.440]
Gord right now say that you had this you had this country in the palm of your hand and you walked in

[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.320]
You got some theories on that we'll take some colors on that we've got to take a break at 1012 at W IOD

[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.240]
We'll be back Miami-Midi

[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.940]
We're back we're back on a Tuesday

[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:59.180]
Is that what it is so did you normally have you ever work in your career with a another co-host?

[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.560]
Not not per se no

[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.100]
I really have it no I've always wanted to in

[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.340]
Fact when I was at wins we used to bring people in an audition them on the air

[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.360]
Really which street

[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.820]
Yeah, anybody that walked by you know

[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.480]
Good everybody happy like the girls at the time, you know come on in and

[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.600]
Right

[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:27.620]
But that that's soon ended when they they told me straight out that they didn't have the budget to have a sidekick

[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.160]
And I thought the time that the bird worked into the sidekick thing with Neil

[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.480]
And worked into it really well well it worked you know for a while and then things

[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.920]
Have to be saved as money a yell. I wonder where he used today

[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.080]
I don't know I heard a lot of rumors he was working up in Lakeland, but I'm not quite sure what he's doing

[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:50.920]
Let's take this call here. I don't know a while. Well it matters. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Rand fan show

[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.820]
Hey, Stanley what how you doing? I'm here. Hey, I got a question for you. What's the question? What yeah, what's the question?

[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:05.680]
While you're doing the daytime show if there's an opening any evening where the New York Yankees aren't losing or something like that

[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.720]
Are you still doing the evening shows or what's the scoop here? No

[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:15.100]
G Michael McCay was on last night and I completely forgot about it and I didn't turn the radio on

[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.880]
I'm sorry. I was gonna turn the radio on to see see what show sounded like but

[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.740]
So I'm very embarrassed by the fact that I didn't do that. What was I doing last night?

[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.980]
You've even listening to your own show. No, no not listening to the radio

[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.500]
But that's nothing you I hear you

[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.420]
Stanley tell me is a Randy Shihot-Dabre what the heck is going on here?

[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:40.180]
A fabulous babe. She is fabulous. It's much more relaxed today than she was yesterday. She looks great and

[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.400]
Looks like she got a nice

[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:49.520]
A nice bit of rest overnight. I had to the power went out in my house last night. Nothing else to do. It couldn't read anything

[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:55.480]
Basically implantation. Well, that's good. I'll tell you it's a pleasure and a privilege to be the very first color of the day on the Rand

[00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.300]
Stan show you guys are doing a great job and we appreciate it sir. All right. I'll talk to you later

[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.640]
See you later. Bye. Sounds like you're a guy who'd like to be on radio

[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:10.040]
Has a lot of the how do you how do you get that impression the Rand Stan show the way they lower their voice?

[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.720]
And pretend there are radio announcer being clever. Well

[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.680]
We got a mobile online five

[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.140]
How you doing Stan and Randy?

[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.080]
Great. How are you? I can't complain

[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:27.500]
Stan I'm listening to Brian Farrier. I figured you like that one. Yeah, right. Do you know that I heard it?

[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:34.260]
Do you like Brian? Farrier's Randy? Oh, yeah? Yeah, I'm listening to him play down here. Don't I know you believe that a lot of things not played down here

[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.240]
You have the album that's bad no idea or what yeah, I've got that

[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:45.020]
Talk to you a Tanner who's coming in sometimes it's more about how hard it is to get new records play down here and

[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:50.900]
I don't know why I am. Oh, let's ask him how he selects his records whether or not a consultant does it for

[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:59.960]
They flip a coin I do or dark sometimes I gotta say a Brian Farrier story. I'm sitting in a

[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:07.820]
A terrible restaurant in Colorado spring at the mall called the Red Robin which is like a Friday's but it's not a Friday's

[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:15.820]
Yeah, right it was really horrible and I hear

[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:21.560]
Slaved love by Brian Farrier playing on the you know the the system and

[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:27.460]
Which that's the first I've never heard a Brian Farrier record in a restaurant while I mean I heard it in my

[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.060]
Hair salon but anyway go ahead and your hair salon

[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:39.680]
Oh, I see well, I thought you were cutting here. Oh, okay. Hey, that's a big business. You know, that's a good business get into

[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.940]
Oh, yeah hair cutting

Poem poem a poem sure

[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.840]
Randy

[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.380]
And Stanley went up the hill both with a prop in a quarter

[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.480]
Randy came down with two I don't think

[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.480]
I hear that one, but we do appreciate you trying to be clever

[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:08.680]
I got you see when I needed the the care package. Yeah, right? You know

[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:16.800]
Speaking of which care package Salman Rusty donated eight thousand dollars is it toward the relief fund for the

[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.420]
Iranian can you imagine the reaction to that when they find out in Iran?

[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:27.160]
Yeah, they'll probably ship everything back to oh, no, are you kidding? They'll say give us money because that's what they want

[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.220]
They want money. Oh, he said strictly for humanitarian reasons

[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.120]
He'll love and even though they're still a place on the tip him put his return address

[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.740]
$100,000 or RuPaul's or whatever the hell camels

[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:46.720]
Yeah, to get him get him what the heck my Annie good morning

[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:53.180]
Yes, and good morning, Stan Randy good morning, buddy. Yeah, you were saved a few minutes ago. You were wondering why

[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.820]
Mr. Mandara said what he said well, I can give it I can give you

[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.180]
Mr. Mandara's situation in two words

[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:08.400]
He is a terrorist and he's a communist well, it's an interesting point there

[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.480]
And also something else you don't know he's also been imprisoned for 27 years

[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:19.200]
So he's in a major time or well the point is he is around terrorism. He's around murder

[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.600]
He is a communist. He's you grind himself the AC and that they see any

[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:30.160]
Congress is a line with the communist also something else you didn't know and I get from them

[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.960]
They know until I found out that our president

[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.540]
gave your taxpayer your tax money to Mr. Mandara $10 million dollars

[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.400]
I think we're 10 days ago

[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.080]
And 10 million

[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:49.380]
Was given to this organization was given to Mr. Mandara to tell him about no cement dollar and I've told a lot of people

[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:55.040]
They never even know about it, but and they what you call they are very upset that the government of the United States

[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.740]
gives money to

[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.780]
terrorists and communists when they're they're supposed to be in democratic country

[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.320]
You're simple as I mean, you know, I mean I don't I don't go for a part. I'd either okay

[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.300]
I told Mr. Mandara was what he was made out to me

[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:16.700]
But now now he puts his foot in his mouth by a lot of himself with photography and with the doubt

[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.900]
Has no one arrested these no one himself with anyone who supports his cause well

[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.120]
Anyone I mean I don't think there's anyone he doesn't support well, you know

[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.980]
The more the point is he's not he's not democratic. It's what he's not democratic individual

[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:35.300]
I mean this point's been brought out that he has and this group have murdered

[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:40.740]
For us in South Africa. I know that right. I mean anybody like that forget it

[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.100]
I listen I'm not human. I you know don't worry about myself with the human situation

[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:49.080]
But as far as Mr. Mandara I think what we shouldn't done down here

[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:54.080]
It's just told we don't need you Mr. Mandara and that and that and that ask me that that

[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.220]
The then labor organization

[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.240]
Thank God. I don't belong I don't belong to that organization

[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:05.520]
I would personally go there and kind of my card was I'm not I don't know what might union money

[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:11.920]
Go into somebody who was a communist and a terrorist. You know simple as that all right sir. Thank you

[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:18.280]
Thank you. Bye. Bye. It's interesting that this particular organization has supported Mandela financially in the past

[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.420]
And that's the reason he's coming down. You know how much money he's making at every stop

[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:27.020]
I mean he's collecting big big checks to bring back to Africa

[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:33.840]
He says to support his organization African National Congress and a lot of it is is going to buying weapons

[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.440]
You know what scares me it's the

[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.640]
the possibility that

[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.620]
His appearances in this country are

[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:51.420]
Just basically a facade. It's moderation presented. He happened to open his mouth and say the wrong thing at the wrong time

[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.200]
And after he collects all this money and he goes back

[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.060]
Then what happens? Well, that's a thing. We're gonna have bloodshed in the streets

[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.020]
Absolutely. I mean this guy couldn't back in the jail

[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.440]
You know, I don't think so. I don't think he's gonna end up back in jail

[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:12.740]
They can't possibly do that to him anymore. Well, he's he's I think he definitely should be recognized as a

[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:20.100]
human rights leader I mean for being in jail for 27 years believing in in what you

[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:27.320]
What he's believed in and kept at that fire burning I certainly don't think he's on the same scale as a Martin Luther King

[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:33.760]
No, no, I mean and he gets a ticker tape parade in New York on the Nilson Mandela tracking that he's in Washington

[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:39.940]
Then does Lana and then he comes down here on Thursday, which would be an interesting adventure 1024 when it take a break and we'll be back

[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.900]
That's horrible. They're selling well come on. They're selling all sorts of

[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:54.040]
Things during the tour, which again are going toward the African National Congress. They said any wedding mandela outfits

[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:58.400]
No, no, no, any thank goodness. I don't think that that'll catch on you know

[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.780]
Certainly not a fashion blip as they say satin tour jackets 50 bucks

[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:09.920]
T-shirts two different styles mind you 20 bucks a pop actually that's cheaper than Paul McCartney T-shirt

[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:15.220]
That was like $32 a Nilson Mandela sweatshirt for $29

[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:23.360]
baseball cap or a Nilson did you see walking around in Washington with his New York Yankees a cap on and and jacket

[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:29.520]
You can buy windshield decals for three bucks buttons for three bucks

[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.180]
I think chronicle I didn't know they were doing that. Oh, absolutely

[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:38.740]
They were writing poems and songs about this guy when he was prison now we can buy

[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.620]
T-shirts jackets

[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:45.200]
hats and Nilson Mandela I'll tell you that's the American way

[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.300]
That is the American way

[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:52.060]
American way so out of the 20 bucks. So what 10 goes to

[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:58.740]
Nelson and 10 goes to the American way of life. I saw a real example of the American way of life

[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.780]
I've been called Rado the Air Force Academy

[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:09.500]
The gift shop now they have a huge gift shop and guess what they have in there all of the things that you could possibly want to buy

[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.100]
for your wardrobe

[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:17.460]
Everything you name it all in khaki colors or well blue and silver and

[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.260]
hats and jogging outfits

[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:26.060]
I mean you don't have to go to Jordan Mars short of bird eyes or any place just go to the Air Force Academy

[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:31.660]
Pick out your whole wardrobe. I didn't see any dresses that they didn't quite go that far

[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.200]
But it was huge that those guys would look too great in dresses

[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:41.060]
No, I don't think by the way do you know that the armed forces have have banned a two-life crew?

[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.640]
We'll talk about that really from being sold in their stores or played on the base. Oh

[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.540]
Someone said well that's ridiculous. It's not like those guys haven't heard those words before

[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:56.140]
Well, it's a military is very interesting. They're very uptight about stuff because I was with AFN in Germany

[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.280]
When Elvis became very popular. This is before he went into the army

[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:06.300]
He had a lot of hit records and they didn't play any of those records. We didn't play any of the rock and roll

[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.660]
Bad rock and roll and Satan tell you

[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:14.740]
That's the same thing all over again. It really is. It's really interesting how that's coming around

[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:20.640]
They really have to recognize the fact that rap music is its own art form all together. They just don't had a deal with it

[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:26.240]
So Bill Tanner will be here from power night. I think I'm gonna come in. I think Don Cox and Mark Mosley

[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.720]
Yep, and then a little later on will have

[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:30.880]
Mindy

[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.940]
Mindy from Mindy from just from

[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:38.320]
Mindy Mindy in Malo show right from hot one of five. So it should be quite a morning right here at

[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.380]
6 and W. I.O.D. Let's take this color in Miami. Hello, Randy

[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.120]
Good morning. Hello Stan. How are you doing?

[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.080]
I don't know if you remember me. I used to use a nickname called Dancing Queen's

[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.640]
Both like Aga so much. Oh, yeah, been a long time since I've heard you the Dancing Queen. What did you say?

[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:55.720]
What was your nickname?

[00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:01.660]
nickname was Dancing Queen. It's my CD hand up because Aga was very popular. Okay. She was very into Aga

[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:10.680]
Somebody walked out of here with my CD that I had of Aga. You haven't you're a you'll get through it Stan. Trust me. I don't think so. You'll live through it

[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.680]
It's difficult to get them

[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.480]
I know

[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:23.800]
Because they don't seem to keep very much of it. Stop even though they're very still very popular than music where in Europe

[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.880]
Okay, what's up? Dancing Queen?

[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:34.980]
A little bit so that one thing I wanted to comment on the last color that you had that was talking about Mandela is that

[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:41.980]
I don't agree with everything that he had to say Mandela had to say but you've got to understand his position

[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:47.360]
Being in jail looking out from barb, you know wire. Why are you standing? I agree with you there

[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:51.620]
And the other point is that the people that he spoke about

[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.600]
Didn't um

[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.660]
hesitate to

[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:04.520]
Give them any support of the ham and yet this country sat on the fence and we're supposed to leave the human rights people and all this

[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:10.440]
And yet we were sending money into South Africa and and closing our eyes to what was going on over there

[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:17.020]
I mean we had a two-sided vision here. I think it's a United States is a real shaky position at this point

[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:23.460]
It's my own observations first of all you have a minority rules government over there white people are ruling the government

[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.780]
The majority is black and they've really kept the blacks down big time

[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.880]
And now the decision is how do they integrate them into the system?

[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:38.180]
How do they put them into the government without losing at least a bit of control and they're you know

[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.320]
They're pretty shaky or they've gone into towns

[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.740]
They've helped the economy the white folks help the economy build a town

[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:52.640]
And now the question is how do they give it over to the blacks without losing control and I mean we did the same thing with that

[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.840]
American Indians here

[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:59.780]
We sort of pushed them out of their their homeland and how do you give it back to them? That's a big problem

[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:03.960]
And that stays is not one to uh to come up with solutions in this situation

[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:10.920]
And the other part is that Mandela by coming here and going around and making these speeches and talking to the different leaders at different levels

[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.320]
Is showing that he hasn't hold a grudge against us for our policy

[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.740]
And we should think you know and why should he hold a grudge against somebody that gives you 10 million dollars

[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.200]
Well the other part is that he at least came over here with his hands open to collect checks

[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.620]
Yeah

[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.460]
That's the coming people

[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.240]
That's their choice they they were sending money over there anyway

[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:40.400]
See the thing that bugs me though is the fact that uh he has been booked by an organization which is not based in this area

[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:46.520]
He's been booked to speak in this area and his appearance here is simply going to again

[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:52.100]
divide the ethnic community in this area and and that you know

[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:58.340]
I don't know how you know under the first amendment man has a people have a right to booking man has right to speak

[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.000]
but uh

[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.920]
Why just wish that it was in Boston or someplace because here you have the uh you've all you've already got the divisiveness

[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:13.900]
But he was in Boston and we already had such we already had such prookial attitudes in Miami that we only

[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:20.900]
Listen to what we want to hear. I mean he stands for a wonderful thing. It's a horrible deplorable condition in South Africa

[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:26.820]
Awful has to be changed. I don't know how though. I don't think he does either. That's the problem

[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.660]
At least they had the dialogue at big step

[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.740]
Well, you know he's starting it

[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:37.380]
It's interesting in his little speech in his retort to Bush yesterday when Bush was quoting

[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.700]
Dr. Martin Luther King about the non-violence thing and then

[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:45.980]
Mandela came back and said wait. Whoa. Wait a minute. I'm paraphrasing very loosely here

[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:54.240]
if you're you know if you're oppressed uh and and you have to do some things that maybe you don't normally want to do

[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.120]
Which is interesting because in his support of Fidel Castro

[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.060]
There's a lot of oppression in Cuba

[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.180]
So is he advocating then the oppressed people in Cuba

[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:10.120]
To arm themselves and fight against the government which is exactly what he's saying about South Africa

[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:15.000]
Well, he certainly doesn't point that out or no he likes the fact that the Cuba

[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:21.280]
And the PLO are giving him support money whatever they're giving him. He'll take it from anyone at this point in time

[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.680]
But also he was looking back

[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:27.320]
Over the fact that it is real ascending money into South Africa and selling them

[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.960]
On things against like when they weren't supposed

[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.880]
Supposedly that wasn't supposed to be being done and we were sending money and it wasn't till

[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.720]
1985 that we voted about sanctions that's only five years ago

[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:47.160]
Yeah, we did drag our feet sometime and it doesn't really say much for supposedly we're supposed to be this

[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.440]
big democratic

[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.540]
ideal and that we

[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:58.280]
But we will still support people and governments that um yeah look what Bush is doing with China

[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.500]
China and it happens and um Central America

[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.940]
Our identity queen thanks for your thoughts. That's very very nice

[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.360]
I like you I can tell I missed him he wasn't here yesterday

[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:15.440]
In Boston you were just talking he was there there were uh dinners for Mandela

[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.060]
$5,000 of plate

[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.060]
California reception tickets were

[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.480]
$1,000 to $50,000

[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.000]
I guess to honor a new york

[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.740]
$5,000 to $25,000 of plate does that mean you get a sandwich for $5,000 and for 25 now you get

[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:38.980]
You know uh, good time rib yeah right something like that is that how it works probably all cold

[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:47.600]
I guess so good morning Hollywood. Yeah, hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello

[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.580]
Uh first of all let me tell you I miss you in the morning

[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.200]
Oh, thank you

[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.800]
My morning drive is not the same

[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.920]
Oh, I appreciate that thing

[00:24:58.940 --> 00:24:59.540]
Mandela

[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.380]
Yes, this guy what first of all let me tell you I

[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.240]
Have been to South Africa

[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.280]
I have relatives big family in South Africa

[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.300]
I talk to them all the time

[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.700]
Mandela's a communist

[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.640]
He is a bitter

[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.440]
hateful

[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.200]
miserable human being who lies

[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.700]
With every breath that he takes

[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.140]
His wife is probably worse than he is

[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.200]
They live in a one of the townships called Soweto

[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.240]
The little house that they always show you is not his house

[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:43.560]
He had a house which was for Soweto fairly large

[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.060]
Uh

[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.940]
They were building

[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.420]
He was in jail at the time when he was having a castle built

[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.820]
Cross the streets from which they presently

[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.440]
Where they were living at the time

[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.240]
But I mean a huge mansion that they never show you

[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.360]
We never hear first let me tell you apartheid is bad

[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.220]
Horrible horrible. You're horrible. It really is

[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.320]
But it's not as bad as we'll let to believe

[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:16.100]
Uh, in many instances. Sure it is. You've got a government run by a minority. We're already raised. Let me just tell you

[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.160]
It's wrong. I don't question this

[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.820]
But when you go into the big cities like Johanna'sburg

[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.760]
Blacks go into restaurants along with the whites

[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:31.960]
The blacks stay in the same hotel the government it does not have one black member

[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:32.760]
No

[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.980]
I'm not forget the government for a minute. We'll get to that

[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:42.220]
They don't they live I'm our racist. They live in the same hotels

[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:48.880]
They walk the same streets. They are not stopped for passports which we are led to believe has just happened

[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:51.280]
This has been going on for years now

[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.780]
Uh in some of the small cities

[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:54.720]
Uh

[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.140]
Like being back in Nazi dump

[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:02.600]
You know, there's just the blacks are like being there. They're total slaves in small towns

[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:07.420]
So the question is sir how do we get rid of apartheid what's the solution

[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.060]
If I do I would be a very wealthy man. That's right

[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:17.360]
That's the question. I don't think anybody knows. I don't think he knows either. He doesn't there are people there

[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.800]
What's the name border lazy who is ahead of the zoolos which is the largest tribe in Africa

[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.860]
That's who's much more moderate

[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.040]
Uh

[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.080]
Mandela has set down

[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.240]
Certain rules that he said the white government have to follow

[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:40.960]
In order for him to sit down and talk with them. He wants everybody released from prison

[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.580]
He wants all restrictions lifted. He wants a lot of things

[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:50.640]
He wants a lot of things right he has no right because he has no government standing to set down the rules that have to be far

[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.260]
Sir, you don't ask you don't get

[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:59.620]
Well, you you could ask but you don't say that this is the way it must be you ask you sit and you talk about

[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.660]
Where are you going to go? Okay?

[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:02.740]
Interesting point

[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.640]
You know another interesting thing somebody who has faded into the bar background is Desmond Tutu

[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:15.020]
Who basically is a non-violent person and now we have the Mandela's who are out in front

[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.300]
Yeah, so what's going to happen when he brings all the guns and stuff

[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:25.560]
What happens people will get shot people are going to go right what I did exactly the last time I was in Johannesburg a couple of years ago

[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:26.740]
Uh

[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.980]
We were leaving Johannesburg to go up to Pretoria, which is a terrible city by the way apartheid at the capital

[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:38.260]
Uh apartheid up there is and wise and full force. I mean it was it was awful

[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:43.820]
But we were leaving uh Johannesburg and I don't know 10 minutes after we left the city

[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.180]
There was there was an explosion

[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:52.280]
Right near one of the hotels outside one of the government police buildings it

[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.040]
Blue diamond stores jewelry stores buildings out

[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.600]
It hotels out. It was a huge explosion

[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.200]
Uh censorship of course in a newspapers people don't know about it

[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.060]
They call people you know

[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.340]
Friends or relatives or whoever they know within that area to find out what happened

[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.900]
But these bombs really don't accomplish anything. They just kill innocent people

[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.900]
Well, it sounds like the uh

[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.020]
It sounds like the guy. All right. Exactly

[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:26.980]
That's exactly what the that's what the ANC is and this guy comes in and tells our president that he's going to teach him

[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:32.920]
About apartheid and how and the story that goes on in South Africa. That's nonsense

[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:40.040]
And as far as let me just give you another as far as I'm gonna take a break here. You want to hang on sure? Okay, hang on

[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:47.020]
All right, we'll uh take a break 1041 come back don't forget around 11 o'clock. I guess uh built hanner

[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:53.480]
Don't talk mostly from power 96 will be in and we'll continue on six 10 WID

[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.220]
See

[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:01.220]

[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:05.900]
In that great boy are we heavy this morning

[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.660]
But I know I think it's a big contest going this is fascinating about all the hype

[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:19.480]
The t-shirts sat in jackets and everything so what so rather big contest going as to who has the most hype the new Tom cruise movie

[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.960]
Which opens today or the Mandela to well will be tough

[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:29.960]
I think you'll have like rock and roll shirts for you know the Wilson Mandela tour of nightie

[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.900]
You know something like that Nelson Mandela

[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:37.100]
Nelson Mandela satin jacket. Yeah, 50 bucks there great

[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:44.060]
Not bad Tom Cruise was on the cover of the Rolling Stone magazine. I guess nilson's got to make the cover of him

[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:51.000]
He'll be there next obviously are we jaded here. I mean here's a man representing the spirit of human rights

[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.280]
No the fact that people want to be free

[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.640]
Well, what are we buying here with the satin jacket? Are we buying $50 with the satin jacket?

[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.660]
Does that buy ammunition to blow away people in South Africa?

[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:06.700]
I'm sure a part of it does because he does not uh he believes in violence

[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:12.640]
To get you know the end justifies the means that type of thing or the means justifies the ends

[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.180]
He is not a nonviolent man

[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.200]
I'm not sure that's the way to go though and neither is president bush

[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:26.360]
Well now that we're going to have we had the Cuban community split in Miami on on Mandela's appearance

[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.660]
So what we can have is we can have them printing up t-shirts

[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:31.580]
Out in front

[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:36.860]
You think they'll be very vocal out in front. I don't know. I don't know

[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:42.960]
There it says somebody's holding a news conference today Cubans in favor of Mandela's appearance is holding a news conference today

[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.060]
Are you serious? Yeah, I'm absolutely serious

[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:53.600]
We'll get our news update on that one. Let's check out this line in Miami. Good morning. Good morning. How are you? Fine. How are you?

[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:55.440]
Well

[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.560]
Too good in this moment

[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:01.220]
What because I'm listening to the on Mandela debate. Uh-huh. The only good thing is that

[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:05.540]
You understand seem to be doing it pretty right and keep it above the table

[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.320]
But the other people are just um what other people sir

[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.240]
Well, what are you talking about give us an example here? Where can you

[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:18.640]
Is the feeling is the feeling of annoying that um by being from Liberty City

[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.360]
I don't have to go far to see oppression

[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:25.160]
And um knowing that you know, I don't believe in it terrorism or

[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:31.700]
Or whatever whatever but I believe in something because I'm here and to have people um

[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:39.500]
That's angry and upset and he's erasure than he's it is. They're just missing in tie-point. What is the point? Tell us

[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:45.520]
A man was imprisoned 27 years of his life. You know, he's fighting oppression

[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.780]
minority rules and uh

[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:53.760]
This I just feel real negative about Miami and in the West

[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:57.980]
Bevind us because you know, I have a lot of ad friends and a lot of whatever

[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.480]
uh, other friends and things and I don't want to um

[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:07.260]
Be angry with them because who they are but I find myself easily being able to

[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.500]
Define an anger inside

[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:15.120]
Because it's it's about living in Miami like I said, but when I live in Liberty City is my

[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:19.540]
Maybe there is something to it being oppressed and having this feeling

[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:24.880]
And um in this anger is okay to be angry and to want to strike out against something

[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:29.400]
You know for our condition or or and I'm not saying me as an individual

[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:34.120]
But you know, what does that get you or what does it get the community by striking out?

[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.400]
What is it? What does it do?

[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:41.640]
Sometimes it makes me feel closer and more informed than

[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.220]
And if it's possible blacker

[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.800]
Not not americanized, but just

[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.640]
Just right with my roots. You know what I'm saying?

[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.100]
It's it's like I live out in the found blue area

[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.360]
In the white blusher, but I hate it

[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.740]
You know because I like to smell barbie q or hear a long gunfire in the air

[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.480]
See people playing cards and I can't enjoy that

[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.840]
You know what I'm saying? You run right down to Liberty City every time

[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.540]
Well, I'm probably not gets off scott free, huh? I'm from there

[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.980]
Yeah, but you don't you don't you agree with me

[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:21.100]
You think this is good for the community for this outside group that's holding this national convention to sponsor him in here

[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:28.960]
Well, that's a good point because what what in least I mean if the if if their convention was being held in Phoenix

[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.240]
We wouldn't hear another thing about this

[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.640]
But it happens to be held here

[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.860]
Now what it means that mandela's coming here. He's already spotted the

[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:45.360]
The crap about the Castro and the PLO so he's so immediately he's got two huge groups

[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.180]
Like in which you're gonna react

[00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:49.580]
One of course and then within those groups

[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:56.720]
You're going to have people react. I don't think anybody's disputing the fact that of his struggle

[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:03.060]
Of the 27 years he was in jail the fact that he still remains true to the ideals

[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.200]
That he

[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.720]
Once held and still does

[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:15.920]
But these the solutions he's offering are not very palatable. Let me let me say our answer stands question because that brings me to the black community

[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.820]
So-called leaders these these people and they're not my leaders. I don't know who selects these people

[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.820]
Why lies can't go on? There's a self-appointed, you know

[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:28.340]
Why our lives can't go on if the Cuban community else is for this or what?

[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:32.400]
Or if the Jewish community else is for this or what why we can't have our operating Liberty City

[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.040]
Why do we have to make an issue? It was said you can't what what I'm saying we want

[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.440]
I mean none of them was to have been and face something intelligent like what you do or doing

[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.620]
I mean these people why did they be encoded in the news by

[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.360]
Saying what we're gonna go on as a community and do dada dada dada

[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.060]
You know, it's like you know there it

[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:55.960]
They don't even know what to say because they really have nothing you know the only only black leader

[00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:00.680]
I've heard being quoted around town is that the leader of the end end of ACP

[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:05.280]
Oh, she's good. She's very good. She's good. She's very strong, but she's the only one

[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.940]
We have some positive people and I will be there thirsty at on the parts

[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.800]
Well, um, this is

[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:15.420]
It's perfect for us if you know what I mean, you know for as as a people

[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.720]
Where if he doesn't need to have acceptance from um

[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:25.660]
From all of the other groups, but we as a group of people here, my name if it pisses me off that our leaders seem like

[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:29.200]
I'm milled especially if it's a riot then they can talk

[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:34.900]
But anything else like economics or they can talk about drugs, but economics

[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.440]
Well, that comes with education sir

[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:46.840]
Nothing intelligent to say in that bothers me. Well, that bothers me too, and it should bother you should bother your community

[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.280]
and and that's that's why you know, I'm not

[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:55.640]
I'm really I don't want to become emotional about this because I think you want to stay in a hell in the perfect

[00:36:55.660 --> 00:37:01.360]
You're saying what I would want to say in an intelligent highway only differences. I may become a little more emotional

[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.120]
Like with that last car. I may call him a racist and telling the shut up or something

[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.620]
Here to every now and then well listen. We appreciate your thoughts. All right. Thanks for calling

[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:17.160]
There's another aspect that's going to be very interesting and that's going to be the television coverage coverage

[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.540]
of not mandala

[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:24.640]
But the community reacting to mandat right right because the TV stations

[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.640]
here in soft lorda have this propensity to

[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:34.720]
cater to the Cuban community and they're going to find themselves in a difficult position

[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:39.840]
They cause a lot of blacks are already upset and if they

[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:48.740]
If they pull this usual stuff that the herald and that the couple of the TV stations are known for with regard to the Cuban reaction

[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:54.220]
And that's why I'm glad to see the split in the Cuban Cuban community because now what you've got

[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:59.200]
Is you're going to have the television news folks who are going to have to be on their toes to make sure

[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.680]
They don't give a slanted version of this whole thing, but we know that won't happen

[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:11.060]
I wish she'd knock some mic off here 1052 a lot of colors to get to we will do that after this break

[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:18.160]
I'm taking what they're given cousin working for in postcards of Rochester New York descend to his mom or working out in the

[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.940]
Nodless machine at the local health center

[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.560]
But Neil is on vacation

[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:28.940]
Filling in for Neil this week Randy Martin and Stan major on new stock radio 610 wio.d

[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:34.500]
I'd like to see Neil working out on the local Nodless. I think that would be quite a sight of you

[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:39.040]
I got a feeling that Neil is not where he told everybody he was going to be really

[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:43.720]
Yeah, you think he is in holiday all that I'm not going to say where I think he is but

[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.820]
From what he told me where he was going to go

[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.540]
I think he probably spent a couple of days there and what someplace else and because you said he doesn't like

[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:55.740]
The cold and it's cold there. Well, you know, let's not go any further than that

[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.960]
People are really gonna know where he is by

[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:03.160]
What a know of coldly had to buy new suits. That's what did you have to buy new suits? So did you have the pants taken in?

[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:10.800]
Why is everyone fading away and you're that kind? You don't just go down to the store and pick out new suits because you look good

[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.340]
Well, I wish I could lose two pounds and look that good

[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.440]
Ha ha ha

[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.320]
It's all on how you dress

[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:24.160]
1057 good morning. This is Randy Martin along with standmaiders sitting in for the vacationing

[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:29.040]
Neil Rogers we've got some calls coming up here before we get into newstime

[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:30.560]
Miami shores

[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.180]
Hello, hello

[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:37.340]
I'm calling about the Nelson Mandela thing the Nelson Mandela thing

[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:45.000]
Specifically the spanish community and their protest. I heard in the news. They're even talking about

[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:52.780]
Rallying when he comes in the town and I believe one of the guests said should he have come to Miami

[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:58.780]
I think it's a perfect place to come to especially with our problems that we have in the community

[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.780]
It seems the Hispanic community

[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:11.760]
Only wants to speak out on issues when it really concerns bill point of view when Orlando Bosch the whole thing was going on with him

[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:17.300]
They didn't see any shame of coming out too much for his support

[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.560]
You know, yeah, that's a great point. I was gonna bring Bosch up and I'm glad you did

[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:30.720]
You know and as a black college student it becomes very obvious how the whole little system works

[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:36.040]
It's all right to speak out against Nelson Mandela and his supposed

[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:41.640]
Terrace actions, but when it comes to Orlando Bosch you make you wonder is it all right to

[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:46.120]
bomb a couple people out of the sky because well, you know

[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.620]
That's not your your point of view and they didn't have your point of view so it's all right

[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.980]
It's for the freedom of Cuba. Oh, that's patriotism, you know

[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.400]
Right exactly

[00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:01.700]
And he was in jail simply because they couldn't find a country to take him right and now it's our

[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:08.180]
Responsibility to take in a man who the government says he had something to do with it

[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.860]
But so the Cuban community you can understand you can understand

[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:19.960]
Um, people getting upset with his comments about uh, I mean you can understand that definitely

[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:27.480]
But let's put it this way. Let's say you knew me as a personal friend. I did something for you that really helped you

[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:31.900]
You know, someone else tells you that I've been doing something else

[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:37.580]
Which might not stand up to you know your morality or something do you are you still for hate me?

[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:44.860]
I mean how are you gonna you know base that opinion the Cuban community seems to forget he's been in jail for 27 years

[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:50.560]
He hasn't been visiting for Dale, you know his name, you know, worry was on his country

[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.240]
He wasn't around visiting dignitaries and other countries

[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.240]
Well, thank you for your call. We appreciate it. We appreciate your thoughts

[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:06.420]
We've got to take break here Henry Barrow with the news and then we've got a whole studio full of people coming up next

The opinions expressed for the guest's foster colors are not necessarily those of the station

[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:39.140]
Now for Neil Rogers here's Randy Martin and Stan Major

[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.000]
I figure being radio so long. I'm deaf

[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:48.000]
I can't hear anymore without headphones. I got a crank this up real out

[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.800]
Well, we're joining the studio by Bill Tanner Martin mostly Cheryl Lee from Power 96

[00:42:55.780 --> 00:43:01.300]
Well, we're glad to be here and yeah, it is so you see you have kind of like this ghostly echo in this room

[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.900]
We like that. We like that

[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.280]
That you love him

[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:08.600]
Okay, we like that. Well, thanks for joining us. The two loud crew

[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:15.860]
Exactly the two left. Wait there Tanner watch it. I'll add to a wrist you there. I thought we brought sure it's Nick along

[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.600]
Hold on to the rest of the world for one down home

[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.340]
There's beloved morals

[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.320]
Understand where he says

[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.360]
Rest that

[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:42.840]
I wonder did you hear at this nightclub is it's the side is gonna have a tongue-up party where people can wear their tongue as I wonder if the sheriff will be there to arrest

[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:43.780]
He's been there before

[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.380]
The thought it was the future

[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:53.320]
So I'm gonna I'm gonna you're gonna be wearing a tongue. I'm gonna host. Oh in a tongue

[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.900]
Stand made they didn't they should arrest you then they have to double the price

[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:06.300]
You know I thought you want to see be us evening news the other day. Yeah, there I saw myself one day

[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.120]
I was I was watching the news

[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:13.500]
It was one of these things where I had already seen the ABC news six thirty and thought I really wasn't interested in the news

[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:18.680]
But the people were hooking the cable up. Yeah, so they flipped it over channel six and caught the seven o'clock news and all of a sudden

[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:21.360]
I came on out of file footage and what did you say

[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:26.420]
Uh first one in this chalky the first quote was pretty good. I said that

[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:32.280]
That Donna Summers love to love you baby was like an eight-minute orgasm

[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.880]
CBS selected that my mother said did you have to

[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:43.400]
That's right and then I don't remember what the second was it was highly insignificant like most of

[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.440]
What I said in my career

[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:52.080]
We were talking about uh Nell the Mandela all morning and you were doing it on your show this morning

[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:59.440]
It was the hot topic on our show this morning. Probably will be again tomorrow. It was I think one of the fairest

[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:06.060]
Most balanced sides we have a very Hispanic audience about two-thirds of the listening is Latin and uh

[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:11.940]
But there were a number of of Cuban listeners who were calling in saying well, you know there is uh

[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:16.840]
We don't agree with him and we don't agree with his comments about Castro and Gaddafi and

[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:22.200]
Arifat but we do think that he has a right to be heard and make his statement

[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:28.080]
So it was a more that's a lot of people remember the way Cuba was the day you know the way before Cuba was

[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.720]
I think we don't want it that way again

[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.900]
Yeah, we don't believe them but let them go ahead and see it

[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:36.680]
You know, it seems to be that those are it seems to be that some of the older Cubans

[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.320]
And I say this sort of as a generalization

[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:43.920]
Maybe treading on dangerous granular but seems like some of the older Cubans are the ones that are so

[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:44.800]
Uh

[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:49.200]
Benton suppressing anyone who doesn't agree with what they say. Yeah, that's younger

[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:53.200]
Which happened to be a lot of people in government. Yeah. Yeah, very true

[00:45:53.200 --> 00:46:01.440]
well of course and and this swings very neatly into this whole two-live crew issue here of of you have people playing to the voting

[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:07.280]
Public which is old and conservative and people will call talk shows like this one all day long

[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.500]
They will call my show and they will raise hell on the air

[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:15.660]
But ask them the last time that they went to vote and you'll find a awful small

[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.080]
I think this two-live crew has

[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.980]
Die down the issue has died down a lot

[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.680]
One of the polls they have third the public is

[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.020]
Exactly there was a poll what in the

[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.360]
Fort Lauderdale news through the sunset or something like that

[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.360]
We was kind of hard to because I

[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.780]
People are tired of hearing about it

[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:37.560]
Like you said stand on television defending it and so you find yourself in the position of well

[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:42.080]
Jim I really defending what they're saying and the answers no defending their right

[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:47.960]
To say it and and a thought came across on our air this morning that I thought was worth repeating and that is that

[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:53.560]
The system is supposed to I think work that you can it's a free country. It's free speech

[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.260]
You can get out and the marketplace

[00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:01.640]
Of ideas supposedly will shake out and the and the best ideas will come to the top

[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:05.940]
And that's the way it's supposed to run so that's that's what the society's all about

[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:11.020]
Tolerating descent you may not agree with the person but you should agree with their right to descent

[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:16.520]
And you're talking about here's an interesting thought that throughout we're talking about in the car coming down listen to you guys

[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.200]
Mandela will not renounce violence, right? Right

[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:27.120]
Well with the Boston Tea Party and non-violent act or what? Yeah, that's a good boy

[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:32.500]
This you know 10 years ago on why 100 when I was on in the morning I talked to the sky

[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.680]
I can't call his name. What's his name?

[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:40.160]
Puzner Vladimir Puzner and at that time he was really spouting the Soviet line

[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:43.380]
It was right after Afghanistan and I said to him sir

[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:51.440]
You know we have this problem with you're just invading another country. Can you expect Americans not to be upset?

[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.340]
Anyone on said well what if Mexico was falling and their government called your government and said please come help us

[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:01.720]
Then you saw chaos about to descend on your southern border. What would you do?

[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:10.660]
And then he said an interesting point. He said yes, we are a revolutionary society and I believe yours is too

[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:15.140]
So you can't fight on that point. Yeah, and so

[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:21.000]
Well what bothers me Bill is what's the next target then? No boy. I know. Is it any Murphy?

[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:22.680]
Well, yeah

[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:27.800]
Navarro or I assume I assume that the racial overtones let's talk about

[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:31.760]
Dice player and redis player. Well, did you hear Navarro say

[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:33.300]
that

[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:41.560]
He does not find anything else in the record stores of scenes but that he won't act until he has a complaint

[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:47.320]
What is legal or he won't actually get the court order tax? Let's let's go buy an Andrew Dice

[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:53.720]
Clay album and complain about it and see what happens. Well complain to who don't Nick. I guess but you can't take the initiative

[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:57.140]
I'm like there's a quarter order so you can do anything as long as the cameras are there

[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:58.520]
Sorry

[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:03.140]
We have two or more through life crew

[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:07.200]
I'm talking about two life news crew

[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.100]
Yeah, I

[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:13.300]
I have a makeup man that's right with me

[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.500]
He's doing a real bad job

[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:21.040]
I told him he's not supposed to Nicole my eyebrows together

[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:27.860]
You know, we have actually hidden miniature cameras in my eyebrows before when we did cops one time

[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:31.860]
Well, you know, G Michael McCay is doing the night show while you're doing the mid-day show here

[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.760]
His telephone operator for death apple bomb

[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:35.440]
Uh

[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:42.140]
Actually has had a fantasy love affair for years with Nick Navarro because she goes from then with one eyebrow

[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:47.720]
I met mold children get lost in my eyebrows

[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:55.640]
Let me ask you this bill or mark Cheryl and or sure Nick or sheriff Nick well in some sort of

[00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:01.920]
Show business here how much show business is involved with two live crew and a lot of doing a lot of business

[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:07.560]
For business I heard and saw him on on heraldor

[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:12.840]
And I don't think he he put over too many good points because of the attitude he conveyed

[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.820]
Think it turned a lot of people off to

[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:20.820]
We're back to this thing we discussed before of it's very hard to defend them because

[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:30.380]
Their ideas are not popular, but then there's something about to be said for us isn't it supposedly the hallmark of civilization is how

[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:34.440]
I'm I don't know who I'm quoting or what I'm saying. I actually saw just make this up

[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:40.620]
But how a society treats its minority voices when not this minority colors

[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:46.820]
But it's voices of dissent one of the great hallmarks of civilization is how a society or is and treats those people

[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:50.040]
And no Luke is not easy to defend

[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:56.000]
Well the thing is people are willing to listen though. It's just the way he presented his argument. Yeah, I agree

[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.140]
Angry does not

[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.740]
Exactly. I mean he was I think he's the only one that had people

[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:10.420]
That is not exactly exactly non-angry and non-hostile now is he but he's a bit more articulate oh boy is he can is from the sample of talk show people

[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:17.260]
Can that man hold his own? Oh, yeah, he's not he's not one to be politically

[00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:23.640]
What's the word I'm looking for well? He's trying to be politically astute. He isn't playing to the voting

[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:28.360]
So he doesn't he doesn't play to the camera his set of priorities and he articulates them well

[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.760]
He knows where he stands and he stands where he knows he understands what he's trying to get across. I think though the the

[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:40.080]
The fact that he's here after 27 years for everything he went through

[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.840]
That's a large reason why people are showing up anyway

[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:49.320]
He doesn't have to talk after that. By the way, let's hear it for your caller that was about 1045 1050 when we were in the car coming in

[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:53.400]
What an articulate and well spoken person we were talking about that

[00:51:53.400 --> 00:52:01.680]
The film the community city black person and he was gonna go out to see Mandela and that and your point was well taken about here

[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:04.760]
Is this what is this apps me that is bringing Mandela in?

[00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:13.380]
The problem is that that I think he should come to Miami because I think we have to confront and deal with these things

[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.240]
and I think the voices of reason have to

[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:20.440]
Speak up. In other words, rather than another police shooting

[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:28.320]
Or accidental death or an on-accidental type thing. I mean he's not gonna be available to crowds of any sort down in Miami

[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:32.860]
The only leg of his trip where he's not gonna be seen by crowd

[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.500]
Boston New York handled it, you know

[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:42.780]
Washington but not down here. Well, it's interesting that you made a reference stand to office or lasano because I was at a

[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:50.720]
Fair recently where there was a booth where they were selling t-shirts and a certain

[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:56.100]
Faction of that community views lasano is something of a hero. Oh, yeah

[00:52:56.100 --> 00:53:05.700]
So I'm surprised that a group hasn't formed to support these guys that got in that were off duty that got in the car

[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:10.000]
Exhaust duty cops and decided they pulled their pistols on do a little

[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.640]
No, yeah, a little celebrate celebrating. I'm surprised isn't a group that's you know

[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.960]
been formed to support them

[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:24.920]
Yes, that's when you see groups with the point that doesn't give a performing or getting publicity when you see group team card

[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:34.560]
When you see groups supporting lasano and selling the lasano t-shirts and t-shirts for his defense fund and things like that

[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:37.060]
Then you have to say in these are the same people that will say

[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:37.880]
um

[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:47.360]
Let's not have Nelson Mandela and you're I am me that's not by a mandality. Yeah, let's you have a mandality shirt as these people are the same people who will say

[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:52.940]
G if he ever played in Cuba. Let's not have them at coyote. Yeah

[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:59.740]
Right, I heard someone mention that on the air on my show on your show this morning and and they were mentioning in a negative context

[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:04.900]
It was a Cuban listener who said we got to tolerate make the decisions like that our community leaders

[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:12.920]
They make the decisions for the community well in the era of the sound by you get back to the whole question of what does it take to get elected

[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.640]
I saw a very

[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:21.080]
Neal would say ponderous, but it was interesting discussion. I think it was Bill Moise and of all people Leslie

[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:25.840]
Talking and it was interesting but ponderous and

[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:27.000]
Leslie

[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:30.220]
Moise was essentially essentially saying look

[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:38.020]
Um you people have permitted the election to be stolen in 84 and 88 the band and your journalistic responsibilities to

[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:39.160]
critique

[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:46.600]
Politics and to bring out the issues so as result we have flag waving and who was the prisoner that they were running around

[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:53.600]
Hortley Horton and you have all this deciding an American presidential election and let the style says wrong

[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:55.860]
We were

[00:54:55.860 --> 00:55:00.260]
Saying all the time Bush has not answered the questions on Iran Contra

[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:02.600]
Willie Horton is this and that the flag

[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:10.080]
Issue is not the big issue on to elect the president on this was in 88 and yet what you had for pictures

[00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:17.160]
When the pictures of the children waving the flags of bush visiting the flag factory and the pictures were so overwhelming

[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.560]
That they could have been going

[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:25.840]
During the narration and the public would remember those pictures and that says something

[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:29.720]
About the public about here. It'll be interesting to see what happens

[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:35.540]
To bush's popularity now that he's decided that he is going to have to bring in some new tax

[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:39.920]
Yeah, just see that on the wire and still I go wish no finally gone on record thing. Yes

[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:40.820]
Read my list

[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:46.500]
Read my list George what no well now I believe what I said was no new taxes

[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.840]
We are going to be bringing back some of the old tank

[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:54.120]
And I believe I can still keep my campaign promise the American people

[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:57.720]
Say the course thousand points of light whatever the hell that means

[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:02.080]
I don't even know dan sure is held unknown. Where is this?

[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:03.340]
I don't know

[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:06.340]
In the tree house in the tree house

[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:10.180]
With the secret service playing Nintendo all right

[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:16.880]
It's 1118 we've got to take a break. So long as we're available here give us a holler and date 7519463 and Howard

[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:20.340]

We're back 1122 build Tanner mark moseley Cheryl v from power 96 dan and I are back

[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:35.740]
smoothing in between

[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:40.000]
She thought to do you talk about on the air what you guys were just talking well

[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.500]
Yeah, I think Tanner should because that's a very important point and that is

[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:47.100]
Does the media lead or does the media respond?

[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:47.780]
Hmm

[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:55.660]
Boy the answer is is that the public really responds to the media giving the public what

[00:56:56.540 --> 00:57:00.680]
It thinks they want okay, but how many congressman and senators of ball headed

[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:02.620]
Oh, what ball headed

[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:08.940]
No, think about it. Think about it. I am working about you remember the country there

[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:13.080]
Pleasure to be there. They got to look the part of the ultimate

[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:16.080]
Yeah

[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:20.700]
Me that in reality the Republicans didn't put quail on the ticket because they thought he would be so

[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:21.440]
photo jade

[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:22.620]
Yeah, exactly

[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:26.420]
And off the air got he this big

[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:30.140]
The most money wait a minute who makes the most money during a campaign

[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:33.840]
Well the ad agency your media

[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:40.520]
Recommend that the candidate do this too and these are the guys who are sitting back in a room at the

[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:44.200]
Convention and and telling a bush or whoever it may be

[00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:53.720]
Whether or not they feel the American public is going to accept it's the instant consultant thing the instant

[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.960]
What is this where they get six people in a room?

[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:02.320]
Focus, yes, and enter instant focus group. You have an instant focus group on who your vice president

[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:05.480]
Okay, and you see here's the problem the hard choices

[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:09.840]
Facing the country are not easily definable in a TV sound bite

[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:16.800]
Explain to me to savings and loan association mess. Please and a sound bite explain to me. Please the deficit in a sound bite

[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:23.240]
It neither of these are sexy topics at all the public's kind of getting I read about savings and loan mess because they've heard enough about it

[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:28.220]
I mean it's the biggest financial scandal in history one one sound bite that comes out of that is five dollars out of every

[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:34.420]
Americans pocket for the next 27 years. Yeah, yeah, good way to and that was a very good way to someone package

[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:39.280]
But how long did it take that to come up and and in the first place? It's like oh boring

[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:42.280]
Who wants to hear about the savings and loan saying it's just not as

[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:42.720]
Thank you

[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:43.700]
The flag

[00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:49.760]
Tell them the texture pocket. Let's take a call and see what people are thinking about morning Miami. Hi good morning everybody

[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:54.300]
How are you all today? Hi good. Uh, tenor. I'm always enjoyed your phone

[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:56.740]
Examela years that you've been down

[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:57.960]
Go ahead

[00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:00.000]
400 I've been here longer than you

[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.960]
Thank you. That's right anyway

[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:08.960]
This issue has been beat to death, but I'm gonna beat it some more the two live crew issue

[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:12.920]
This one I bring up a couple of points and if you agree with me

[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:15.420]
Make no wrong

[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:23.760]
Everybody has their studies a glory seeker, but what people don't stop to realize as is this

[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:31.140]
If they're making a big deal over the two live crew thing is and I'm not putting this very well here

[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:39.600]
There's two albums out. I know you guys know this you working at radio you know this and I know I'm playing in the back versus the nasty version

[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:40.660]
Okay, yeah

[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:42.540]
He's sitting here

[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:49.660]
And standing images he's sitting here making a big deal over the two live crew when he can be going after

[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:55.080]
Anterdice Clay who doesn't make two versions of his album, but there hasn't been a complaint registered against

[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.960]
Anterdice Clay right now. I sure like to register

[00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.980]
I'll go down there to find

[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:07.200]
On the bad wagon. This is my next point here you get one person. Let me take married with children for example

[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.860]
I happen to like that so I don't like it

[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:13.800]
You have one lady up in Illinois. I wear the hell she was at make a complaint about married with children

[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:17.520]
So there you got 450 people after her that are gonna say oh, yeah

[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.920]
We're making the same you know we agree with it and it's like

[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:28.880]
We lost a lot of average then you know one nut can definitely spoil a barrel, you know, and but I love the tank

[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.920]
I'll call in a whole lot of letters to everybody in their other together point across

[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:35.740]
Well, you know what it's you know what it's gonna be next. It's not gonna be anterdice player

[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:40.140]
It's not gonna be anything like that. You know what it's gonna be it's gonna be a new to Miami heralds

[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.760]
It's gonna be Bart Simpson oh

[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:42.060]
Bart

[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:45.020]
I'll be back to play

[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:50.260]
I'll be back in play. I think it's for me. It's gonna be Bart Simpson and then here's got to go

[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.800]
Well, it's one principle already tried it right?

[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:58.200]
Danny misshared sure they said that don't want to have underachiever shirts

[01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:03.440]
You know the problem with all these arguments is that there's a little truth in both sides

[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:07.440]
And that's when the argument becomes hard is not just clearly black and white

[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.960]
Let's see tenor here's here's the thing that gets me but let's say for an example

[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:19.300]
I'll use myself as an example here because I'll do this. I'll do this. It's happened before let's say that I listen to your show

[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:22.720]
Which I happen to listen to it all let's say I listen to your show and

[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:29.960]
Tyrone does a rap or something on there and and let's say that that he does something that I don't agree with and I call up

[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.180]
And I say and I say to the station manager

[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:38.360]
Oh, this this went on the air this morning and then somehow it gets spread into the news or something like that

[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:43.600]
And then you know now you know there's gonna be three or four to people finally say yeah, we heard it too

[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:50.940]
No, yeah, now nobody's gonna say anything unless I say something. I like to ask tenor a question since these and management over there

[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:59.320]
Has tyrone ever done anything or is mark ever done anything all of tyrone which has resulted in a very legitimate and concerned

[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:02.540]
Compile from the black community. How do you handle it? Yeah, and

[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:09.280]
From time that was early on in the character early on I think that the people concerned and we liken it to the archie bunker situation

[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.700]
It's parody it's satire

[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:18.560]
We are an equal opportunity offender. We have and it's not everybody in within today. Let's jump in a red net from David Florida. Hey, yeah

[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:27.900]
Red wood ladies and gentlemen is here. Thank you. Thank you. Pio plenty. I have not bathed in a couple weeks and

[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.440]
I would like a beard

[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:37.440]
His wife is a sturdy woman with back hair. Oh, she's a cold weather woman

[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:42.680]
So you know, but that is and we got complaints

[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:49.340]
Well, we had Mindy on our show. We got complaints about Carmen Gonzalez and that was funny from the community

[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.700]
It's a hysterical character and

[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:55.520]
You know the the fact is that that people

[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.680]
Doesn't that show you though that you can't please everybody

[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:04.800]
Well here and that's something to try fortunately nobody can I think on this station

[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.760]
I mean, you know

[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.720]
They get complaints all the time about Neil and and and about I'm sure everybody else on the here

[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.220]
But if management doesn't understand that the descent is the format

[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:18.880]
I just want to ask one more question and maybe bring up another point here

[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.760]
How come they

[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:27.360]
This week is me how come they singled out the two life crew? Why not go after the public enemy number one

[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.780]
So they did professor grins or something like that because they're in broward County and another thing

[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:33.920]
Now I'm just no type for me

[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:34.880]
I don't think

[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:43.800]
Now I don't know if you're familiar with the reggae music, but reggae has if you listen to some of the reggae artists like shovel rings or a tiger

[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.760]
And you know what I don't know if you're familiar with them, but they

[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:53.360]
Just exactly do the same thing as two life pruning they're doing it you know in a different step nobody never complain about them

[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:56.060]
If you feel as strongly about any particular

[01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:00.900]
Thing that's offending you and you have the time and are willing to invest it

[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:07.240]
You can affect the type of change that the gentleman that started the two life crew has brought about

[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.080]
Thanks for calling sir. We can take some other calls

[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:15.720]
Interesting point though is it just for our county? Is it because two life crews in broward County?

[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:20.880]
Have certain function certain elements in broward County the two life crew was locally were local to date county

[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:25.880]
But they you know Dave Broward in the local area that is the judge point out is served by the same

[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:26.860]
Florida

[01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:30.000]
Think about where did that term come the media?

[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:35.220]
I mean how many people do you know they say I live in south Florida right sure

[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:39.780]
But anyway the point is you do have a publicity seeking share if you do have a

[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:42.400]
rabble rousing wrap group

[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:46.920]
That is here locally and very available and you have a

[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.180]
Backed by holding up a very

[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.960]
conservative and older voting

[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:59.080]
Public that I mean did you see the pictures in the paper of Nick with the little you know the people who've organized

[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:03.560]
Sunday schools have organized little eight-year-olds to say we love sheriff Navarro or

[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:07.760]
I mean that's that's you know he can

[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:12.660]
It's right the White House in the Nixon years when they would talk about the polls and how their mail was running

[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:18.640]
Well the sheriff tells you how his mail is running yet the poll that was taken didn't you try that interesting in the paper this past

[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.960]
Friday morning was it Thursday Friday morning when they had the poll and said that a large number of people

[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:28.300]
I think it was about a 53-54% majority really supports the two-live crew in this issue

[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:34.500]
Granted that it's the young younger and more tired of hearing them and they want Nick to get off the TV already

[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:38.220]
Third of them want to get it's enough already it's enough already

[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:42.940]
But that now Howard County okay, Nick Navarro really put it on the map

[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:50.620]
For this you ask you a question Cheryl is here and Randy here. Let's have you listen to this as vast as you want to be on

[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.580]
I think it stinks. I think it's awful and

[01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:53.880]
what

[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:59.960]
How offensive as forget about to how offensive as women is this to you

[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:05.520]
Very offensive so I don't listen to it. Uh-huh. I feel it's practically the same way. It's like it's there

[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.040]
Okay, I don't have to listen to it though if I don't want to

[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:13.400]
It's just like a lot of Andrew dice clay. I can take like five or ten minutes of Andrew dice clay

[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:19.900]
But I would not pay $20 25 to go sit through a whole concert of him cursing this that you know the F for this

[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:24.820]
Yes, where this the F for this after a while it gets to be boring. We do the right to turn it off

[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.900]
We're not going to the contest return this show off. We're not by the record

[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:33.940]
Yeah, but I think the people who want to censor that and prevent in the name of cleaning up things

[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:38.640]
But who are they to speak for Cheryl? Yeah, for you who are they who put them in charge?

[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:43.120]
There's like a lot of separation. I mean I'm a person who goes to church every Sunday and they say you know

[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.780]
Don't listen to that. That's bad

[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:48.700]
But you've got to make your own choice. It's like okay, well the church doesn't like it

[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:53.820]
But I have my own opinion like Mario Cuomo and abortion what happened with this whole thing

[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:57.960]
I think it went too far from the start we we need to protect the children

[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.500]
From being exposed

[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:07.920]
Didn't that up to a parent and Mark is my parent exact I am a parent and if I know that my eight-year-old son

[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:14.480]
Chris can go into the record store and buy the two-life crew album then that to me is unacceptable. It should be

[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:21.540]
Put behind the counter. It should see what it was was I think the judge made the ruling with the intention that

[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:22.920]
This should happen

[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:27.920]
But what what happened was then then people went too far and said okay, you can't you can't lie

[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:31.940]
No one can listen to this album. No one can listen. No, that's not about that

[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:37.720]
Definitely overstepping the the interpretation. I mean you're misinterpreting what the judges rule

[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.260]
Don't you think Bill when this goes to a higher court that's

[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:41.660]
On the next

[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:49.740]
Got there's a tool of thought that said the judge knew that he was going to be overturned on a higher level and that he could fit right nicely in with

[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:56.300]
The the right thinking moral people in our community and come down on that side easily knowing that he's going to be overturned

[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:57.360]
That's a big philosophy

[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.820]
But you have any problem with

[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:01.980]
Stickering albums, do you?

[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:07.080]
Well, I have a problem period, but I think that that in the real world

[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:11.080]
Personally, I have a problem. I think you should put it out there but they put ratings on movies exactly

[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:14.440]
And I think in the real world randy you have to accept that because

[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:19.720]
You have a lot of people just as Mark mostly said you have the two-life crew that is pushing the line

[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:24.860]
Pushing it horribly they've offended you they've offended Cheryl Mark mostly does want his kid listening to him

[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:31.100]
And therefore there must exist if we're going to have their right to speak then you have to have some sort of a screen to say

[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:34.580]
Hey, they're speaking this and maybe parents want to know about it. So yeah, I've

[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:39.500]
I've kind of reluctantly come around you think the same goes for an Aussie

[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:45.840]
Osborne. Yeah, for sure I think it's even more difficult in that situation because then you get into religious

[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:52.160]
You also have that case coming up on July 16th where they're saying that some rock group or whoever it was

[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:55.640]
Caught some city committee. It was on that was just a rolling stone

[01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:01.620]
Yeah, I remember eating that and then you have Charles Manson's people who claimed that the Beatles help the sculptor

[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:04.660]
sure was a part of

[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:10.740]
That murderous rampage it took place what the late 60s. So we should ban a little McDonald's hamburger

[01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:15.820]
Okay, let's take another call. See what's going on. Broward. You're on the air. Yeah

[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:19.640]
Basically, I'm a former broadcaster myself

[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.960]
Few of people know me

[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.800]
Basically what I'm getting at is

[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:31.160]
This is America if you want something you buy something if you don't you don't have to listen to it

[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:34.860]
Well, you don't have to buy it with a 10 year old child who really

[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:39.260]
Cannot make up his mind or that maybe drawn to this because of the

[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:46.060]
The mystery of it the entry of it can go or could go in and purchase it and I

[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:49.000]
Think that's not a good thing. Well, I mean how many

[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:53.960]
Instances do you hear of small children small young boys sneaking playboy into school

[01:09:56.260 --> 01:10:00.400]
Let's find the two-life crew out to be pornographic. Let's put it behind the counter

[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:04.220]
Let's be done with it. Let's not rate it next no one can listen to this

[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:08.940]
But I don't think you burn books or ban records in a free society

[01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:15.800]
My point is that okay sure put it behind the counter put an age limit on it

[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.260]
But you can't take it away from a free society

[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:24.660]
This is a free society as we start to see that America is turning out more like Russian Russia's turning out more like America was

[01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:25.920]
How many times have I heard that?

[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:29.200]
I'm gonna hear a lot more about it. I mean, this is absurd

[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:30.520]
It is absurd

[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:36.400]
It's really absurd unfortunately it comes from the place where we live too, which makes it even more

[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.700]
Yes guy asked me how I felt about

[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:45.980]
This area being known for dirty lyrics. I said I feel much worse about it being known for censorship

[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.200]
Yeah, you're right about that. They're saying that the

[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:55.120]
Deregulation is happening if you watch channel 39 or 33 all the non-affiliate stations

[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.480]
You can see TNA all day long

[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:03.700]
Yeah, but that's gonna stop because because Jesse Helms and his cohorts are

[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:07.280]
The holes is the right in the polls. Is he gonna lose? I hope well

[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.800]
I hope so too. What about the whole the art funding?

[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:12.800]
In the end the whole

[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:20.900]
funding or or with holding fund or shutting down exhibit? It's very hard to defend to

[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:25.080]
Christians the concept of an artistic exhibit

[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:33.060]
Where the guy is immersing across the crucifix in urine that's very hard to defend

[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:34.540]
but

[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:38.100]
The point is as a whole I

[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:43.880]
I have a run across crowds of people holding up jars of urine with crucifixes and I'm no I have a run across

[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:48.240]
Know is why could you the taxpayer fund that kind of art?

[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:53.880]
That is the real you know that's the question or whether it should come from private funding

[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:58.860]
That is is I prefer I don't think the government really has much business at all

[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:03.960]
It being involved in the arting our god. I mean then you have just who is the government Jesse Helms?

[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:06.240]
That's the scary point. I know

[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.820]
Again, who is this who is this man?

[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.700]
And why is he telling us what's art and what's not?

[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.260]
That's why we need those new taxes

[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:18.980]
You can show crucifixes in urine

[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:22.100]
Thank you George. Let's take this mobile

[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:24.440]
Totally against the lyrics

[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.400]
You're doing it

[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.840]
Yeah, I don't like broccoli

[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:38.340]
Well, let's ban it. I don't have to I wouldn't ban broccoli. I'd burn broccoli

[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.320]
I wouldn't be burdened at this juncture

[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.940]
It's talking to us wouldn't be good

[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:45.580]
Totally can't sit

[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:49.140]
Everybody has a right to listen to what they want to listen to

[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:52.280]
That's why I'm president. I make you do

[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.180]
Thank you

[01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:00.620]
Take another mobile call good morning good morning

[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:07.780]
First time caller I hear the show constantly and finally got up the nerve to make the phone call

[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:13.960]
Good for you sir. I really want to talk a little bit about the situation not only regarding two-life crew

[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:17.540]
The other things that happened happening lately and broder

[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:22.500]
I'm 31 years old and I like to go to the

[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.700]
Beach everyone

[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.580]
Your phone is really awful sir

[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:33.520]
Yeah, he's selling going on mobile. Well, thank god. He likes to go to the beach. I've got for technology right exactly

[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.640]
Spend some money to get a better phone

[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:41.900]
I hate to say this I can meet general

[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:52.220]
Generations but I have to think that if the the top the story of the century were to happen and we were to establish contact with an intelligent race from another galaxy

[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:58.300]
The first question the Spanish media would ask is what's their position on Castro? Yeah, and did they ever play in it?

[01:13:58.340 --> 01:13:59.660]
Well, and can they be using coyote?

[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:01.580]
I mean

[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:03.660]
I mean, that was just not about that

[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:10.740]
Castro's an inacred isn't even old man. He's on the way out on man. That was about something else embarrassing. He's still alive

[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:12.780]
Oh, it is

[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:20.480]
I also want to say canner you just one of the most articulate intelligent voices on the media down here and if thank you

[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:23.000]
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. No, appreciate it. That's the thing we don't get to hear you

[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.660]
That's basically like the heavy topics first thing in the morning. Yeah

[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:29.440]
That's what makes cane number one in New York. Let's talk about the new kid

[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:33.060]
My

[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:39.980]
And the media and how it influences these things. I wonder if any of you can actually say what it was that Mandela said about Castro

[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:46.220]
Boy, you know, there's not a good good question to in my mind what he said now this that that's that's very

[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:49.880]
People here know I'm sure I heard the sound bite

[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:54.800]
But let me spit back to you what what I think he said and then you can if you if you obviously have the sign

[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:56.920]
No, no, I haven't heard it and that's my point

[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:01.120]
Well, what I think he said is that he's these people supported him with nobody else did

[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.120]
And he's gonna go back on now

[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:08.480]
Because you know the challenger blows up and they practically run a continuous loop of it on CNN

[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:15.240]
But maybe it's a little bit complicated the way he phrased it and the long article in the health didn't have the quote

[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:18.420]
And it's the unarticle about that didn't actually quote I thought on TV

[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:24.860]
You know, I saw the clip. I think from the couple the couple show right exactly nightline

[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:28.960]
And why I don't think it's been on much and that's you know that that is

[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:35.520]
You know a lot of people are reacting to this as as happens typically with this kind of thing without having heard what it what it was

[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:38.720]
Yeah, I'd like to have heard it myself and and judge for myself

[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:44.000]
Nelson did not in fact, you know parade up and down the street with a flag that said yay Castro

[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.820]
Yeah, right. No, like I said he has another agenda

[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:54.640]
He's he's got a much much bigger fish to fry and he's for anybody that supports him anybody that gives them what they need and that

[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:57.540]
I have a little bit of a problem with that's kind of um

[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:03.060]
I mean come on. I mean castros human rights abuses doesn't seem well

[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:08.320]
I think I'll call highest and articulated very well in the hero yesterday. Yeah. Yeah when he said that basically

[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:13.680]
You know man Mandela our heroes have clay feet at times and that

[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:17.080]
And that mandala's off base with Castro and our fat

[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:23.240]
And that's not me and so on yeah, and but that does not mean that he's not a hero but Cawsey

[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.360]
You like your right here

[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:31.560]
So here's about something else if I may one last thing real quick about patriotism and free sweet free speech

[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:40.460]
What what flag waivers and and so-called patriots miss all the time with this kind of thing is the difference between condoning and allowing

[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:45.580]
You you know you may be and and it's it's when you find something reprehensible

[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:50.700]
Then it's all that much more important that you defend that as opposed to someone who

[01:16:50.700 --> 01:17:00.100]
Will agree with it because that's a real proof of our of our freedom and the defendable of people to tolerate ideas that is not their own

[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:01.860]
That's right and it's in the easy, you know

[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:07.860]
It's an easy top-up to call yourself a patriot and defend all the easy things like the stars and stripes and the flag and the president

[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:12.340]
But to stand up and defend something you personally find offensive that is real patriotism

[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:15.200]
And when people said that the founding fathers didn't have the two-life crew in mind

[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:19.660]
I suggest to you that they had other things that were just as intolerable to them as a true life crew

[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:24.340]
Sure they did Benjamin Franklin said I may not agree with what you say, but I'll defend to the death you right to say it

[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:33.040]
You know that yeah, thanks for time. Thank you for calling back. Bye. Bye. Let's take another line Miami. Hello. Hello. Hi. I like the direct

[01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.540]
They get what I'm saying towards

[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:41.060]
Don't you know markmozian show. Are they there now? Yes, they are. How are you doing guys? Hi?

[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:45.920]
I live in the car nice statement. I was there when cops broke his head on the car today

[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.400]
I still broken bottle

[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.180]
Yeah, I could tell a little

[01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:52.780]
I'd like to say

[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:58.520]
Dedicated to funk snap two guys. I've got the power because power 96 is the best station in the nation

[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.960]
I'll take guys later. I appreciate you. Thank you

[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.780]
The best station in the nation, eh?

[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:08.860]
Well, I do think power 96 is this it is one of America's most unusual music mixes and there's a good reason for it

[01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:11.260]
You talk a lot there's a lot of talk out there these days about

[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.420]
Bottom up marketing. It's even a book

[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.980]
Empowered i6 is a response to the community that it transmits to

[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:26.160]
Here's my question to you. How does a white boy from the south appealed to a Latin a large Latin audience by listening to the street

[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:31.760]
Both mark mostly and bill Tanner and Jim really are white boys from the south

[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:38.480]
But we love this place this wacky crazy place called Miami. I absolutely love its diversity

[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:43.400]
I live in Broward County and I love to hop in the car and spend an afternoon

[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:51.540]
What are you talking about in South Miami or our coyote or even more obscure parts of west date and then you know get in the car and go to Palm Beach and

[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.620]
You know act like you can afford the stuff on worth avenue

[01:18:55.820 --> 01:19:00.120]
I love diversity. I grew up in Mississippi, which was about as

[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:06.720]
Unilateral a society as you possibly could my father was a government employee all of his life and

[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:07.680]
and

[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:14.120]
That was then this is now and I enjoy the diversity. I think marks a very prejudice background

[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:20.300]
Fairly early age I decided that that wasn't

[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:29.420]
Me no, I like people I like differences. I grew up where am I am fascinating my grandmothers made

[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:35.500]
A black woman as dear to my family as any a family member would bring her

[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:44.720]
Her daughter was retarded and she had a child who was my age and the child would would come to work with his grandmother

[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:50.760]
And would play and we would play all the time when he came time to eat dinner and sunny. He was then with sunny

[01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:57.840]
Couldn't eat dinner with us and as a long as I can remember as a small child. I thought

[01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:00.940]
This is a pile of crap

[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:03.160]
and

[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:11.180]
I can remember many dinner table discussions my older brother through bricks at Ole Miss he threw bricks at James Meredith

[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:12.940]
and

[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:18.980]
While I was on the air as a child as a teenager broadcasting it what was in a mutual affiliate just like this one is

[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:25.860]
When Kennedy was making his speech and we were carrying it and he was appealing to the people of Mississippi

[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:30.300]
to use their sense of history and

[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:35.220]
Remember their heritage and tolerate this

[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:42.780]
You know what was then called an outside agitator and allowed this admission to Ole Miss from James Meredith without

[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:50.360]
violence while the station was broadcasting this I looked down and driving around and around the station

[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.460]
where people with Confederate

[01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:53.900]
flags

[01:20:54.800 --> 01:21:00.220]
Tied to their radio antennas and they were all we were from the second floor in the building with a newspaper

[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:05.500]
And they were riding around around the station blowing their horns and shining their headlines and

[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:07.140]
giving us the finger

[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:09.980]
And I thought to myself

[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:12.420]
I wonder if there's a runway

[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:16.220]
Back door to this place what I ever found

[01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:19.860]
Yeah, we really hit upon uh, I mean it's mostly a Latin

[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:20.900]
oriented

[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:21.920]
Station

[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:27.300]
Wasn't that way when you were at the Y100? No, I think power i6 is less

[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:34.360]
Intended to be a Latin station than it is intended to reflect Miami which is a somewhat Latin town

[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:40.080]
And that's why you'll hear a group like Rockset we played that rockset record didn't it should have been love

[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:43.300]
Could have been love might have been love must have been love

[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:51.280]
And I noticed you might have seen this morning. I had the music research out looking at it

[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:56.260]
While we were on the air and and the number one record is something like

[01:21:56.260 --> 01:22:02.600]
Tiana and first true love which is the very Latin dance record and the number two record is the Rockset record and the point is

[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:04.260]
Miami is a very

[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:07.960]
It's a melting pot and the music reflects it as a melting pot

[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:11.920]
So we're not just a dance station, but we're dancing because

[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:19.720]
The community is rather Latin. I mean even when you add Broward in there's a strong Latin influence and then on the other side of the point

[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:24.200]
When I was the program director of Y100 in the morning guy there for nine years

[01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:27.300]
Why 100 covered a lot of bases?

[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:37.840]
It was for housewives who liked rhythmic or even black music and generally the Latin listeners fell along those lines and you have white women that in teenagers

[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:40.440]
It was in the New York area that grew up listening to Wabc

[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.540]
Before Stan was on there

[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.740]
And no cane cane

[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:50.720]
BK well bottom line is what is coast going to do on the market?

[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:54.380]
Uh, it'll be in the mix with the rest of them

[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:56.280]
Better than GTR

[01:22:56.780 --> 01:23:00.600]
Number one it'll easier to sell than GTR because probably because

[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:07.020]
Yes, probably because the salesman here are more acclimated to selling it and you know this business is again

[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:12.660]
It's all about making money. I what I was going to say to answer you question about the difference in Y100 in here is that

[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:20.340]
The diversification of media the the ex the tremendous number of FM station to come along and maximize their station

[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:27.980]
Their power their signal their promotion their advertising their giveaways their disc jockeys and all the things that make a a music station

[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:29.480]
You know

[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:35.420]
Ten years ago magic one oh two which is probably the revenue leading station in the market these days

[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:39.460]
Was just a little small disco station that was the FM of WRBD

[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:43.280]
I remember that and and and and very underpowered licensed to pop and obit

[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:45.760]
So all these people have come along and improved their radio stations

[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:48.180]
So that that big tent that used to be called Y100

[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:52.880]
In fact, they're playing to a small faction then put out let out which are you know

[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:58.160]
Anglo women they've had to renounce the teens and renounce the ethnics and what they have left

[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:04.420]
Left is the third place contemporary radio station. I mean they're making a living with it and and it's at for what it is

[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:08.460]
It's all right, but what it isn't is a winner. Let's

[01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:13.700]
Let's take this mobile call. It's been on hold for a while you there. Uh, yeah, I'm still here. How are you good morning?

[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:19.340]
Um, the reason why I was following is regarding the situation with the two-life crew and

[01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:21.360]
Mr. Nick Navarro

[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:25.960]
Characere right now go ahead. Yes, I know we haven't talked enough about it yet

[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:29.820]
So that's why I want to put my two fans there. I think we've talked in the cameras in the here in a few minutes

[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:32.300]
All right, it's my her local king. Yeah fine

[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:38.920]
I felt like Andy Griffith who may know Nick. Oh Nick. Well Andy was a sheriff

[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:46.280]
Anyway, what I wanted to say I've been living in Broward for a couple of years only and

[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:50.800]
I've been noticing it's very disturbing when being a young person when you start seeing a

[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:54.980]
Destruction of the spring for example even though there were problems with it

[01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:58.360]
But I don't think they have to take so drastic measures against it

[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:04.080]
The other can't have all those kids down here sir. Yeah. Oh, no. That's that's bad. Is that the same thing?

[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:07.700]
Don't you think it's the same thing? Luther Campbell pushes the line

[01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:12.320]
The kids from spring break pushed the line all of a sudden the authority figures go

[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:18.640]
That's right. We are the enforcers and so it's all the way back. Yeah, where I want the pendulum swings all the time

[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:19.380]
Yeah

[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:26.940]
The other thing for example is uh, well, they did away with the spring break. They did away with most of the topless bars in

[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:29.240]
Broward also

[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:33.980]
Now they're uh, well forget the naughty videos. Oh, obviously

[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.800]
How about they forget them

[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:38.720]
I can't get my video

[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:49.260]
American triple X this and that's gone. I mean uh, what does it take does it take only one person to take it off or

[01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:51.700]
Did in that case? I think one person started

[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:57.160]
I mean because where are we in this situation? I would like to go against you know, whoever it is

[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:02.440]
I believe in everybody having their own right. Don't you think the problem is is that they're organized and we're not

[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:04.640]
It could be I just don't know where you're going. I think

[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.900]
Also, the people are very empathetic about voting. I think

[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:09.200]
Gosh, you really um

[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:16.160]
Tell people the only way they're going to change things like this and get people out of office that are making rules for you is to vote

[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:22.280]
I think the conservative element has always been better organized than then then I don't even call it liberal because the

[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.260]
L word is such a dirty word which remains

[01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:26.600]
Please don't use that

[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:32.260]
No way. I know the situation is how how where do I? I mean as I said

[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.600]
Haven't been here long period of time. I've been here only a couple of years

[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:39.300]
But I'd like to defend my way of living. I'd like to be able

[01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:44.240]
To have a satellite dish. I'd like to be able to go if I want to go with a poplis bar go there

[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:47.420]
If I want to random and next rated video, I want to be able to

[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:49.600]
You don't prefer to live in Romania?

[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:53.380]
I'm going to make Fort Lauderdale a great place to die

[01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:58.900]
What a great average I think yeah, a great place to do

[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:00.460]
They wouldn't call the community

[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.380]
It's true that they wouldn't name the community

[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:06.160]
Sunset because of that very fact

[01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:10.140]
No, I don't call it La Meloland

[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:11.700]
That's right

[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:16.940]
Well, it's like every comedian says you know my parents are over 60. They live in Florida. That's the law

[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:19.020]
I mean that's the law

[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:23.220]
I send them over there and forget about you know we send them there to die

[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:25.840]
So what can we do we can vote is that it?

[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:29.120]
You can vote but you have to organize and you have to have a sexy a film

[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:32.760]
Sound bites as the other people do you I mean it really is about

[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.340]
Randy's back to this whole thing of television. No, I disagree

[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:42.100]
Do you absolutely disagree? And if this gentleman to give me a minute I'll tell you exactly what he can do sure

[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:48.680]
There is an individual who will remain unnamed on this program who is basically behind all this stuff

[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:52.080]
You can do exactly the same thing

[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:57.220]
But the reverse by simply organizing a group

[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:03.920]
To keep an eye on what this particular individual here here here and what other individuals

[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:10.760]
Of like kind or doing because if as long as we can't rely on the Miami Herald

[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:16.240]
That's correct the Sunset and no we certainly can't rely on the TV stations because they're federally licensed

[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:19.820]
We can't rely on other radio stations because they're federally licensed

[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:27.460]
It takes an individual with a lot of time on his hand a lot of time a lot of money a lot of believe well organized

[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:34.240]
Who believes in the first amendment to the Constitution who believes in what a guy like Neil Rogers ought to be able to say on this program

[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:37.760]
Absolutely and let me take something stand is

[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:41.400]
110% correct sir believe it

[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:45.020]
Okay, thank you sir. Thank you for calling thank you very much

[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:51.620]
level 54 we've got to take a break here. We'll come back with the whole crew and the continued discussion next on news talk ready

[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:03.560]
Oh

[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:14.200]
Talking about how bombs are sealing 95 guard rail when southern

[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:18.800]
Lee with the bulletin to this up onto the screen

[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:24.300]
Who his partner and this up she said this up and the eyewitness noon

[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:32.040]
It's covered on Martinez and the two lies who will have more dissails coming up at 5.30

[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:42.180]
He pulled them from the thores because they so dirty. Oh, they're so dirty. Oh, they're so dirty. Oh, they're so dirty. Oh

[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:47.860]
They're so dirty. Oh

[01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:49.680]
They're so dirty. They heard

[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:54.080]
He was a Paul

He could grab a butt

So he had blood so most of the people said this guy is a putt

[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:45.800]
He read the land of that noise

[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:51.440]

[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:53.960]

[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:46.480]
And build Tanner and mark mostly and Cheryl v from power 96. So what's the problem here? You're programming this radio station

[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:50.980]
Yeah, but none of controversy Tanner so jealous of the rickshaw drop-ins

[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:54.260]
The

[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:56.000]
Yeah, come on Neil juice it up

[01:31:56.900 --> 01:32:00.640]
Do you get that stuff up? That's what he was talking about for you left. Yeah

[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:09.080]
I think um, I think that probably my admiration for Neil Rogers with people listening this show is known

[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:10.860]
I think Neil is brilliant

[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:15.740]
He is certainly one of the top people that I've ever heard on any radio station anywhere

[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:22.040]
Uh, what a tremendous wit. He's a witty to quick come back and his voice alone

[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:26.860]
You can read the expression on his face, which I tell my just jockeys they will attest to

[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:34.000]
burgundy rectus as I want to hear the expression on your face and Neil is I I hold Neil up as an example of that

[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.380]
But come on

[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:45.620]
Is juked it up Neil come on gets it and take take away the promotion department and change it to the controversy

[01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:48.600]
Department get the food out of the building and let's go

[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.280]
Yeah, right

[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:58.760]
The car sisters ain't gonna lose the license and so let's get on with some great radio

[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:02.000]
We've got some phone on open. I just want to point out one quick thing

[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:08.760]
W and Ws days where the the controversial talk radio basically started years ago what

[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:11.260]
70 like 70 is something like

[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:11.660]
70

[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:15.880]
So it existed and it was I guess

[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:18.620]
Thingly owned or you know, and it was

[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:22.040]
Kind of like it was not a big corporate situation

[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:26.800]
And it and existed kind of like a boil on the rear end of my any radio

[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:31.400]
But a lot of people listen to it and it was successful and so here comes a big company Jefferson violence

[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:36.540]
And they're gonna put on a talk radio station on a 50,000-bar radio station right beside it everybody should have switched over right

[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:38.060]
But they didn't because it was milk toast

[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:43.860]
Problem and so they said well if we can't it must be our signal we only have 50,000

[01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:49.660]
What's that by this little station over here and and we'll buy it if we can't create it we'll buy it and as soon as they bought it they ruined it

[01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:53.440]
Because the name of this format is not talk. It's controversial

[01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:56.020]
Hell raising so if you are rpd

[01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:57.360]
I would tell you to raise more

[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:00.200]
I don't know where you come hell where you come hell through the corporate people

[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:04.240]
I got the phone lines working way some hell my any

[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:06.520]
Good

[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:12.140]
Broward hey, how you guys knowing there everybody sleeps sir

[01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:14.720]
Was that the only one you're calling somebody a douchebag?

[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:15.620]
No, I'm not

[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:19.980]
Okay, okay, no, did you guys hear the news?

[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:24.420]
Martinez wants to call Mandela a commie? Well, I get to take one to no one

[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:28.300]
He's calling a douchebag and he doesn't really really okay

[01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:31.980]
You're just I'm gonna touch on this two-life cruising once you guys freak out

[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:37.420]
First thing is the parents should teach their kids morals and values not share of neck

[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:41.100]
If they know what's right and wrong and they listen to the record

[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:44.720]
They know that it's just a joke don't don't believe it

[01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:48.660]
But sheriff Nick wants everybody to think well their kids are gonna believe this

[01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:53.040]
Sure, I think wants to get elected again. That's well. I hope everybody remembers the vote in two years

[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:56.180]
That's the key that is the cat's the key. I mean I

[01:34:56.180 --> 01:35:00.940]
I registered to vote on my 18th birthday. Do you vote? Absolutely every vote

[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:03.100]
I don't care if it's for some stupid bill

[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:06.560]
You know our bond issue I vote for every time for you

[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:12.240]
I read the paper every day. I'm 25 years old. That's a majority that it takes you. No, unfortunately. It's a lot

[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:19.700]
Especially for a baby boom. So now that you do encourage your friends to how many of you how many of your friends do

[01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:24.100]
Uh, probably about 50 percent which is what showed up for the last presidential election

[01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:30.960]
It's possible to emotionally charge people to the point where they will get angry enough to go out and vote if that's what it takes to do

[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:31.880]
Then you have to do it

[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:36.560]
Well, that's what I thought if you look in contact. Well, I tell when people come and complain to me about

[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:41.680]
Reagan or Bush or anything like that. I just look at him and say did you vote and they say no?

[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:45.780]
I think then don't talk to me. Right. You're the next one. You're right. Don't talk to me. I want to hear it. I want to hear it.

[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:49.880]
He's not cool to vote. No, they're half a set of people are right to lose

[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:52.640]
Pass the crunch taters and turn up the soap

[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:53.160]
The

[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:59.540]
Three's company. Yeah, I'm too busy or I don't want to take the time. It's too much time out of my life

[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:04.700]
Well, they don't complain for the next four years. I think a lot I think a lot of what had to do with the last election was

[01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:10.500]
Everybody knew George Bush was going to win. They knew the caucus was going to lose and people don't want to vote for a loser

[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:14.960]
Well, what everybody also says and this is true too is when you're on the fence, you know, and you say, well

[01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:17.040]
You know, you think the deal goes for the winner

[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:23.840]
We all we all talk about voting and the first thing comes to mind is a presidential election when all the laws that we're bitching about here are done by the

[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:32.120]
Even the state are the local right the city ordinance people who's who's representing you at the city council meeting and and I don't know about you guys

[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:35.700]
But when I go there and I see all these names who all these people anyway, what are they saying for?

[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:39.980]
Well, we couldn't even vote in judge Gonzalez. He was appointed. Yeah, that's true

[01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:44.220]
You know that's not my we can't vote him out. We're stuck with him. Thank you Jimmy Carter

[01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:50.800]
You know, and I'll tell you that one last thing and wait till the next two live crew album because this is all gonna start again

[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:54.820]
You know it's called on you now what is it called band in the USA? Oh, yeah

[01:36:54.820 --> 01:37:00.800]
That's right. I'm not a week from tomorrow. I believe yeah, it's all gonna start again. It's gonna be just as nasty

[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:03.720]
And I'll tell you it's a media voice form

[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.300]
They're gonna send so more album

[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:12.220]
Out there have not heard that they're putting a clean version out this time although

[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:14.160]
Luther Campbell did tell

[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:22.540]
Uh, assistant program director that he was gonna do a clean version of the first single for us now whether they're going to release this is a

[01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:24.180]
You know to be bought by the public

[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:30.140]
Is the new albums coming out and it can't be played on the airwaves? We're people gonna hear it. You know what?

[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:33.760]
It will be played on the airway the little need is with that tub gin

[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:43.400]
If if it's clean then you can play it on the air and only the other they had three albums out before

[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:45.240]
Nasty as they want to be and

[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:51.480]
People that listen to two-life crew music will tell you that the third album was worse if that's possible

[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:59.620]
Yeah, I thought it was pretty funny. I mean you know what the me so horny

[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:03.360]
Sound bite from that comes from what is the movie mark you mr

[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:09.660]
It's a Vietnam movie whether the Vietnamese hookers are trying to get the soldiers to come in

[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:10.400]
Oh, I know

[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:18.580]
The horny that's the sound bite that the song me so horny was lifted with both around

[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:22.040]
Um, and so I thought the song was pretty clever

[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:25.340]
I mean it's like a lot of the other records you come. I mean are we gonna like

[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:31.760]
Yeah, I mean people say to me do you really like that music you play on the radio and I say no I much prefer bow Donald's in the Haywoods

[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:32.680]
And I play the y-100

[01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:36.440]
You know, I mean a break it's pop music, but the point is this

[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:37.520]
that

[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:40.540]
It was all right for what it was

[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:46.380]
And I knew it would be popular because the actual cleaned up version is like a link and

[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:53.980]
sexy, but not too dirty record clever records type like that are hit with the public now

[01:38:54.520 --> 01:39:00.620]
I do have some problems with this for a long time you see to our audience this whole debate is ridiculous

[01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:06.200]
Because it's closing the barn door long after the horses galloped away because they all ran out and bought whichever version

[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:10.260]
They wanted during the how many months stand nine months of year that it was out

[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:15.380]
With no one said anything about anything and so they could buy whatever they wanted so they're like what is all the house?

[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:17.860]
I wanted to I said that we sit on the air

[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:24.320]
I would have loved to have been in in the courtroom when the judge ruled on this and when he said you cannot buy this album

[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:29.120]
To been able to lean over and whisper in his ear excuse me judge they already have it

[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:38.000]
You know and it's worth just vastly increased. Thank you exactly. What did he sell 2.7 million copies something like that?

[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.580]
Yeah, it's up there. We were talking to Richie Pacto the other day trying to figure out how much of each album sold

[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:46.840]
Campbell got a lot because he does not have a record company's

[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:51.200]
That's what he pointed out exactly and he has had many opportunities to be

[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:56.580]
Affiliated with a major record label and has wisely turned them down saying why do I need you guys?

[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:00.400]
I'm getting all right. Thank you system and I have been on hard to work

[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:01.700]
I'm not a guy

[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:05.940]
But he has that's also um going over into other acts you mentioned

[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:09.740]
Adder died play who hasn't been touched yet, but Madonna was almost censored in Toronto

[01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:15.920]
Yeah, but what what really happened as soon as she said come on and made a little fuss they said oh sorry

[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:16.900]
Sorry, sorry

[01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:22.640]
Well for what I understand she said uh if you want to uh, I'm not gonna change well actually she said I'm not gonna change my

[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:28.100]
Something act for you and if you want to cancel the concert you tell 30,000 people

[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:30.460]
Yeah, not me and then they backed off

[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:33.960]
So that would work if it was made by the police not either

[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:34.560]
I mean

[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:37.660]
Everybody agrees there's a line

[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:46.360]
Over which we don't want our kids to step the exposed or our wives or our mothers or whatever and

[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:48.460]
that's sort of

[01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:57.980]
Pretty much agree of course the question is we can't agree on where the line is drawn or particularly from my saying what who's going to draw the line

[01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:06.100]
Okay, but let me ask you this question just as it just as a devil sad good here. I subscribe to HBO cinematics and showtime

[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:08.960]
I pay money for those

[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:17.080]
And an Andrew dice clay pops up or an Eddie Murphy pops up on one of those channels

[01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:22.500]
I'm not getting my money's worth because I'm not gonna watch these guys

[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:27.760]
And it bugs me that they're on these paid channels with their stuff

[01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:32.620]
Because I don't want that on my household and I don't want to watch it

[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:37.300]
It's a lock on me. I've already paid for that, but I don't want it

[01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:41.640]
It's not this and you're gonna your argument is gonna say well suppose there's a

[01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:46.580]
Arnold Schwarzenegger movie on you don't want to watch it. It's not the same thing

[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:52.540]
Because I can leave the the stupid violent movie on

[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:53.500]
without

[01:41:54.420 --> 01:42:02.700]
fearing that the children in the household are gonna hear the f-word every 10 seconds from an Eddie Murphy or whatever

[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:08.120]
Although the f-word is certainly prevalent in a lot of these movies that are yeah, that's true

[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:11.660]
But not but not it's not the extent that pull that is not the f-word

[01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:14.540]
I think it's not a whole lot rent hidey

[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:20.600]
That'll solve your problem. Yeah rent hidey and just watch some hidey movies and y'all leave me alone because I

[01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:24.900]
I'm a comedian. I'm a bad at it. I want you absolutely

[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:29.360]
10 seconds to wrap being pleased. I did I can do that. I can m- I can get your hand

[01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:34.740]
Don't don't keep the hand away. We're gonna cut out for a car. Take your hand off the butt. Where is that?

[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:42.420]
We just go sitting here trying to figure out how we would program radio stations if we had one

[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:49.820]
Do you have critiques on every radio station? Yeah sure. It's my job. Do you listen to radio station other than yours and don't

[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:55.840]
Yeah, well, I have radio stations that I live my personal favorite radio station that I listen to

[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:59.260]
Uh from my own just enjoyment if I'm

[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:01.900]
Not working is W.I.O.D

[01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:07.980]
And and I listen to the I like the CBS news on wins, you know punch over and hear that

[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:11.760]
Um, so I don't look at music radio music radio. I listen

[01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:15.120]
Around to to different radio stations. I'll punch

[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:20.020]
Competitively course I punch a Y100 and and hot 105 to see what they're doing

[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:24.360]
But they're programming doesn't really interest me because it's not much entertainment values mostly records

[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:31.580]
Just back-to-back records and so that I do more in the concept of working but uh for enjoyment. I like

[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:37.460]
I like to say about the competition though. Yeah, I think hot 105 is a good radio station that is

[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:41.800]
Extremely well programmed by a brilliant programmer Keith Heisley. He's excellent

[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:49.920]
I think that the people that my friend Frank Amadeo who programs Y100 is a nice person and

[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:55.040]
Is completely overrun by the manager of that radio station who should stay out of the programming

[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:57.040]
That you know

[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:00.980]
And uh, okay, and everybody knows it in the market too

[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:03.440]
But they'll tell us how you really feel

[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:07.520]
No, no, anything man. Come on baby. Don't sugar coat it

[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:09.760]
When you talk about the uh

[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:16.240]
Other radio stations around the the the dull contemporary stations. I find some records that I like on on coast

[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:23.020]
Um, I used to like you know what I used to like I used to like joy before they changed it because I'm 45 years old

[01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:27.840]
The format was called 41 format 41 and boy did they hit my button all the time

[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:32.100]
But you see here in the twilight years of my rather mediocre career

[01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:33.300]
I have

[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:38.160]
The demographic I have passed the the age of demographic desirability

[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:43.140]
For you and so no one programs

[01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:48.200]
When you listen to power when you're in your car. Can you listen calmly? Oh, yeah, I I

[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:50.180]
I'm getting I believe as

[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:56.880]
You get upset about some things you hear and and as cost will tell you I do call heatedly at times

[01:44:57.440 --> 01:44:59.220]
Yes, but I believe that

[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.700]
Mostly what this jockey's need when they're on the areas encouragement

[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:11.200]
You need to be the this jockey needs to hear or you toyed up on that last one excellent more more more

[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:19.520]
And that if that is the attitude that the program director has most of the time that that really brings out the creativity and the individual people on the air

[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:26.820]
That's what I want personally the program director. I will say this not many people apparently agree with me because radio is pretty damn bland out there

[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:33.980]
Yeah, some years ago somebody said oh well the disc jockeys are all talking too much and what was happening was

[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:40.640]
People who had no business being this jockeys worked on their talking talking about every day

[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:42.880]
So yeah, I think you have something to say

[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:47.860]
Who was it creatively who was the guy was it Mark Twain or someone?

[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:52.860]
I don't know who said brevity is the soul of wit and that's what being a great disc jockey

[01:45:52.860 --> 01:45:54.760]
I think is is all about when you hear

[01:45:54.760 --> 01:46:03.060]
Cox just hitting on all forces that to me my favorite personal disc jockey in all the world is Robert W Walker on our station

[01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:07.960]
And he can say more in fewer words and just fit the energy level

[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:16.460]
You know great radio and great disc jockeys enhance the enjoyment of the music otherwise they would be replaced by a CD player in your trunk

[01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:23.400]
But right a great disc jockey who really enjoys music and can and can keep you on the edge

[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:29.760]
You see the about things that are coming up and and maybe weave a little community action into what's going on could curry

[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:32.260]
Who is on our station now is a great joke

[01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:34.260]
They've been trained all the good ones are on your station

[01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:37.360]
Well, I think they can move on

[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:41.040]
I believe in disc jockeys I believe they're important you know, I don't believe it

[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:43.380]
The person non-personality radio is exactly right

[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:44.840]
Good for you mobile

[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:46.500]
Hi, how you doing?

[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.320]
Uh, just as an example how far censorship is um, it's extending

[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:52.560]
I don't know if you're aware of the example of American Exocency

[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:55.260]
I know you're just talking about what you did

[01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:56.120]
Mm-hmm satellite

[01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:58.860]
Yeah, I mean I was a subscriber to that

[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:02.300]
That was a uh, I mean you had to pay a lot of money for that

[01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:06.580]
And you had all these boxes come with a frontal lockout code

[01:47:06.580 --> 01:47:07.000]
Yeah

[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:12.060]
And uh, I don't know how far you've been to the discussion what happened but basically one state

[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:13.940]
Hello, Mama

[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:18.600]
Well, he lost it on the mobile but what happened is one

[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:20.920]
Uh, rural sheriff

[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:24.140]
Came across bunch of teenagers that had these

[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:31.080]
Poinot films that they taped off the satellite and and he filed a legal action against

[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:33.220]
Home dish the owners of the company

[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:37.820]
That operate not only at American Turtle Expo but Tuxedo which was a slightly

[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:42.420]
Tone down version of the Poinot channels that was also in the satellite and he

[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:46.360]
filed a legal complaint against the company's

[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:47.540]
Owners

[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:52.580]
Home dish satellite in in New York which by the way was some xnbc

[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:56.220]
Hauncho that ran the things. I'm gonna involve something or anyway

[01:47:56.980 --> 01:48:03.780]
Um, I mean it was to the point and it may still be to the point where the only thing that is keeping the sheriff in Alabama

[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:07.040]
From extra-diting these people

[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:12.720]
Two Alabama for criminal trial about having invading Alabama's

[01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:15.700]
Airspace I guess whatever it is

[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:17.060]
Is Mario Cuomo

[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:23.180]
And they're waiting to decide if Cuomo's gonna allow the extradition and probably he won't we hope

[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:28.900]
Also that councilman from Palm Beach Ron Howard was opi in disguise right once

[01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:35.080]
Get the 900 numbers off the uh tv. That's today in the paper. I'm advertising on tv especially the women

[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:38.540]
Well, you know, uh has nothing to do with censorship. I get tired of seeing them

[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:40.440]
I mean you watch a move

[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:41.900]
I mean

[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:49.080]
God, I mean you run it right after another, you know, and uh stand let's form a committee against boredon

[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:53.860]
That's so that's it. You know, our answers against boarding that are insulting to your intelligence

[01:48:54.600 --> 01:49:02.760]
That that in the uh the 800 p.i. stuff that just comes up the album that just comes up all the time, you know on

[01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:08.020]
Consistently about damn fear. I get you have to take that

[01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:12.700]
Yeah, you know, I never knew there was actually a damn fear until I saw

[01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:17.160]
Oh record he stole more records than the Beatles and box car really combined

[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:24.680]
It's pretty frightening. I saw a zed on people a couple weeks. I couldn't believe it

[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:28.480]
It's 1227 we're gonna take a break here and we'll be back

[01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:32.780]
The ratings a few days no the 12 the few days before he left

[01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:35.040]
He was saying just exactly what you're saying

[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:39.120]
Let's not really let's not have any more of it. He's gonna fine tune his show

[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:42.660]
According to Neil. This is what he said before left the vacation and you're right

[01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:49.320]
He will too and and what you were talking about he was talking about me was not for everybody, but he is he has

[01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:54.320]
Certainly the head of of a very slim pack of people

[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:59.640]
He can bring ratings to radio stations. Why are you listening to the stations today, ma'am?

[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:01.980]
I'm listening to the station today because

[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:07.180]
I heard a planky about how he did

[01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:08.980]
Let me tell you now

[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:15.020]
When I did go over to my cranberry in the morning and all of a sudden my quits on our

[01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:17.640]
Neil was on I listened for a while. I sent my god

[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:21.360]
He's the same that he was years ago and I switched off

[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:29.740]
Then I'd go back and forth because people do switch back and forth when they listen to the radio and I heard you on I think Stan and you

[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:37.020]
Are very interesting this morning and I agree with Stan what he said about having that in his home if he wants to

[01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:43.520]
Listen to that somewhere else five, but he's he's wise and right to say in his home. He doesn't want

[01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:48.840]
The children there to to have all this

[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:55.540]
And like this if not it's it's you know, we all know the words

[01:50:56.100 --> 01:51:01.760]
And Neil third reminds me of a little kid who says oh, I know a dirty word. I'm where did you learn them, ma'am?

[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:07.740]
Where did I learn what the words tell us the words that Neil uses are not test words

[01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:13.060]
They are words that are just in poor tail. And we want to hear where you learn them

[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:21.820]
What words the words that you're thinking of now the word I'm thinking of now is the one that Neil uses which is a

[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:24.920]
Completely non-custy word. It's just

[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:26.980]
It's just the same as he uses

[01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:33.560]
Animate to a woman who calls up and you go to a banana. It's just what Neil is doing is

[01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:37.020]
That tired parody it's shocking

[01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:48.440]
The audience is running because I don't know if anyone every time I say something Neil oh god, he is he's still on

[01:51:48.980 --> 01:51:54.460]
And that's the only reason I found out he was still on is when I switched I'm now back to WNW

[01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:58.220]
Except on this time when you when Stan and

[01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:00.620]
Randy good

[01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:06.540]
I'm gonna go off the air due to the fact that their listeners over here

[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:14.800]
Yes, well, isn't we appreciate you as a fan of her but it is boring when you have to resort towards like that

[01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:22.900]
It's just so well, thanks. Thank you for an exciting call. Well build out of it now. So

[01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:28.760]
Let's go to this mobile what line is this to mobile? Hey, she's the one to listen to ow

[01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:35.700]
Yeah, that's right. Oh, you're so wonderful. Let me tell you something you'll back

[01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:38.720]
You know, you're not the kind of people they want here anyway

[01:52:39.380 --> 01:52:44.680]
You know, you know, they have a program WID for people like that and knowing that you know

[01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:49.780]
She's one other one of those people that can quote chapter and verse of every show

[01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:53.760]
But she never would you know he's the top of her mind

[01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:58.980]
And that's that's a very interesting thing. It's incredible. She's

[01:52:58.980 --> 01:53:04.980]
Well what position did I'll take on flight burning right never figure there will be further in it

[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:10.480]
But you know, obviously you know, obviously I'll listen. I'll give us a call

[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:16.260]
Well, we do have a celebrity on the line. Marvah, who is this

[01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:21.060]
This is a celebrity. Oh, excuse me sir. Go right ahead

[01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:28.020]
Anyway, I just want to make a make that charm that because I'm driving around all of a sudden I hear this old back call

[01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:29.040]
Oh, you're so wonderful

[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:34.040]
And a ramby and the Neil so nasty it's that same old car

[01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:35.980]
Neil so nasty that's the next single

[01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:43.600]
I was listening to you in Neil Thursday and he predicted that this would all ramby you so wonderful and you know

[01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:45.340]
Breath of fresh air

[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:53.480]
And we had a couple of calls like that. Thanks. All right. We got to take this call celebrity better be a celebrity you a celebrity

[01:53:54.140 --> 01:54:03.120]
You know, where are you supposed to be on this show and you're not hearing the only person that I listen to is

[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:05.680]
Tanner in the morning. I don't even listen to my own show

[01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:06.840]
That's a parent

[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:07.220]
Ha

[01:54:09.540 --> 01:54:16.400]
You're doing a good job off the radio. Yeah, it's got some public appearance. You're living from them. I like to call a pain

[01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:18.140]
You're those hate of your mind

[01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:25.240]
Which car phone are you on though? Nice car phone. Yes, he has a like one on his belt one in his hand one in his ear

[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:32.680]
Isn't it? I think it's important to be as electronic as possible because it's to be able to reach out and touch and feel your instrument

[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:34.960]
They're absolutely at the side of that

[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:39.980]
It's the only tax reduction we have

[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:45.140]
We were just having that little discussion off the air

[01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:50.460]
I just call to say I'm listening and I haven't heard anything important yet

[01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:54.740]
It is you know, we know that's it to go sleep here for a while

[01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:58.560]
But we're back to life talks with you. You have infused this once again

[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:03.620]
Listen, Rod. I just actually took away what to call and say

[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:05.920]
God you guys are boring

[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:12.220]
We have an afternoon opening now between two and six on power 96

[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:14.520]
And you got to need the job exactly

[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:17.080]
Please go to the money. Coconut, I grow

[01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:24.800]
Hi, I don't know am I on the radio? Yes, you are sir. I don't know how I'm gonna top the laps. You've been a high stand. How you doing?

[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:26.740]
I don't know if I'm hilarious. I am

[01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:33.040]

And I am too, guys. Give me my hand here

[01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:48.600]
If they don't like it turn it off

[01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:51.680]
It's your basic sticks and spells break your bones

[01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:58.040]
You know that words will never hurt me works with me it works with Neil works with the two live crew works with Nelson Mandel

[01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:02.200]
Remember in the 1670s the best thing an artist or movie or book

[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:08.500]
What we could do is get it banned in Boston. Yeah, thank you. Hey guys. I'm listening and I'm knowing you made my day

[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:13.720]
Well, gosh, you're so easy. Thank you. Okay, Stan. Take care, buddy. I'm listening here

[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:22.180]
It's so easy. Let's go to deer fields. Hello. Hello. Randy. Yeah. I just said a curiosity. Are you the uh

[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:26.720]
You ever with a station called the lady? No. Oh god

[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:29.320]
I remember that station. I used to talk about

[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:30.380]
Yeah, we have a New York

[01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:34.600]
Yeah, right. We have an opening for a bisexual man from day to call

[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:36.700]
Oh god, they would do that

[01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:38.000]
Got a reminder me Bill

[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:38.540]
You

[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:40.380]
Oh

[01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:40.380]

[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:43.480]
Let me ask you something

[01:56:44.060 --> 01:56:49.200]
With what kind of a I don't think we want to hear that say the truth. Let's go to Miami. Hey

[01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:55.740]
Hello. Hello. I'm on a car phone sort of I heard that old douchebag talking to you a few minutes ago

[01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:01.340]
And I pulled off the road and I'm out of pay phone but I'm still sitting in my car. So that's kind of a car phone

[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:04.620]
Carpools I sell

[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:10.220]
Hey, I called because that lady caught you guys Friday

[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:14.720]
What lady that lady was calling with us talking about owl

[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:15.640]
Rantel hours

[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:21.340]
Same lady almost the same time last Friday because I take a little lunch. I come out and turn my car on

[01:57:21.340 --> 01:57:23.240]
And it was the same spiel

[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:24.380]
I know she's listening

[01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:26.740]
Same story the same douchebag

[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:29.940]
You know she kept that word bothered her last week

[01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:33.820]
I know you guys are inundated with calls so you don't remember them all but

[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:36.960]
She irritated me there and she irritates me today

[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:39.660]
Irritation then and irritation now

[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:43.100]
Is it their cream you can use for that?

[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:44.040]
Yeah, but

[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:45.740]
Oh, I can't are you?

[01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:48.580]
Hey, Randy would sell this time out of the back of his trailer

[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:50.400]
Yeah

[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:51.840]
Randy what I really enjoyed y'all

[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:56.900]
Two a.m. You still listen to you every morning and I know I did out and I know where you're gonna end up right

[01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:04.060]
Well, I'm here for now. Yeah, here's an hour gone for later. Anyway, uh, that's all I gotta say

[01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:09.400]
It's kind of a report on the old hag. Well, thanks same one from last week. Hey, I get another phone

[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:12.460]
Yeah, well, I'm running out my phone bill maybe in this car phone

[01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:15.060]
I'll talk to you later to put it back before you pull off

[01:58:15.060 --> 01:58:19.620]
I need to use some of the old drive-ins remember you put that thing on the window and drive away

[01:58:20.180 --> 01:58:22.480]
Drive away in the whole window would come out

[01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:26.560]
That's wise. Hey, to say I'm an idiot, but I did that twine

[01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:33.100]
1240 we got some day lines open here folks the number is 751 94 63

[01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:39.000]

[01:58:44.180 --> 01:58:45.480]

[01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:46.560]
My friends

[01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:51.320]
Well, haven't I heard that he is no longer with that station and Dallas that he left to go and

[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:59.320]
Worked on back in town. Well, I don't know. I kind of thought he might show up at Waxie and then Budell got that job

[01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:01.740]
Let's talk about that

[01:59:01.740 --> 01:59:06.800]
Is it their first indicated show now or something or something or an hour? Yeah, that's honey was gonna work with someone else on a

[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:14.220]
Really

[01:59:14.220 --> 01:59:23.960]
How many boys do you do I don't know you I don't know you

[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:28.740]
What you see what we like to do I love to on the air destroy my curve and he's all prepared to do

[01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:43.440]
Yeah, are you a stand-up comic also? Oh, yes to a degree. Yeah, what degree? Well, I

[01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:51.540]
I used to do it on a regular basis and now I'm in the process of getting back into it

[01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:54.220]
Got to go to eating is what it is well sleeping

[01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:57.980]
Or because you know when you work when you get up at four o'clock in the morning

[01:59:57.980 --> 02:00:03.920]
It's very hard to be out into the in the comedy club until one o'clock. How did you learn to do voices?

[02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:07.360]
I mean he does the best voices you Michael does great boy

[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:11.240]
I know you know, but the idea to comment last night. I heard you you called him

[02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:15.660]
He said I've been doing voices for 20 years and everybody's calling up and asked about mark. Yeah

[02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:21.080]
He was talking about that. Yeah, yeah, that's true. So what do you do? Do you hear a voice and stand in front of a mirror and

[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:27.320]
You know not so much standing in front of mirror do a lot of practicing and just experimenting when I'm driving in a car

[02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:28.420]
um

[02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:29.960]
I'll

[02:00:30.540 --> 02:00:36.860]
Verily very rarely do I like set my mind towards saying okay? I'm going to learn how to do this person

[02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:41.400]
It just sort of happens a lot of the impressions are learned by watching other impressionists

[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:44.640]
uh, you don't do I picked up the

[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:48.020]
Doing bush from Dana Carvey on Saturday night live

[02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:56.000]
We don't do is a mark doesn't is not we I don't do any of them and mark doesn't do as many impressions these days as he does his own

[02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:04.000]
Caraties he's come up with these two really big hit characters which are tyrone and everybody knows the tyrone some kind of a con man and

[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.720]
Red would everybody knows, you know your favorite redneck. Yeah, no

[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:13.820]
The ones here warm temperate pine down here. Oh

[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:14.740]
Hello, hello

[02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:18.760]
Dan glad to hear you back on the air. Thank you. Well people were talking about

[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:22.800]
What was really the like the nexus of this deal? Well, right now you can't talk about it

[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:26.240]
That's that's what that's the problem is you guys can't talk about it either what's going on

[02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:30.020]
What's going on soon with the two-life crew? I mean

[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:34.540]
This few wonder how the thing all started will start with people that stand and you can't talk about

[02:01:35.060 --> 02:01:37.300]
The censorship started with them. Mm-hmm

[02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:40.500]
And now it's spread to two-life crew and who knows where those guys are gonna stop

[02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:42.780]
That's why I made the statement that I made

[02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:45.540]
Uh, a while ago that

[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:48.840]
There needs to be somebody

[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:50.160]
to

[02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:56.400]
Look over the shoulder of people who get involved in this these are fanatical people

[02:01:56.400 --> 02:02:02.580]
Absolutely, and there has to be a and you can't rely on the Miami hero to the Sun symbol to do it

[02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:06.720]
You can't rely on anybody else. It's got to be somebody who wants to

[02:02:08.900 --> 02:02:13.200]
Support the first amendment and the right of people to be as filthy as they want to be

[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:16.640]
And to be rejected for being filthy or to be bought, you know

[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:19.320]
Free marketplace out there. Yeah, that's a marketplace

[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:24.820]
And that's that the problem is it's the marketplace has been taken away from us by a couple of people

[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:27.480]
We got one talk show host on another station

[02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:31.300]
He sits on a couple of phone books. He can reach the microphone and spews his hate every weekend

[02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:37.300]
Then you got the other guy no one can talk about and they're out there of running the morals for everybody else and it's just uh

[02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:42.320]
It's uh, I think it's just fascinating that uh, that uh

[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:45.820]
We don't see an ex-posa of what's really happening

[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:53.040]
And either the herald of the sun symbol which are the two primary newspapers were more likely to see it in something like the Saint Pete times

[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:54.960]
Well the new time it did a story on them

[02:02:56.580 --> 02:02:59.520]
So what is that that little uh, whining in the background?

[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:04.680]
You're killing your dog. I mean um my daughter's trying to she's throwing her lunch everywhere from a paying attention to her

[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:09.840]
I'm talking to you guys. I hope my wife isn't listening at work and she knows what I'm doing, you know

[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:11.480]
These are lovely them

[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:15.500]
We've all been through that. Well, they're go-speed your daughter, huh?

[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:19.660]
All right, we'll take care of Stan play us. Mo gets in your eyes sometime all right. All right. Bye

[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:21.520]
Mo gets in your eye

[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:24.660]
Of which you can only elude

[02:03:24.660 --> 02:03:30.500]
Should really I think be aware of the fact that he has made himself a public figure and therefore

[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:36.340]
Has to live with the fact to right that he can be criticized um

[02:03:37.420 --> 02:03:38.120]
He will

[02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:40.540]
Gonna happen

[02:03:41.740 --> 02:03:44.180]
No, it's it's not and I'll tell you

[02:03:44.180 --> 02:03:47.200]
I'll tell you the best way to

[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:50.900]
To retaliate against any kind of

[02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:52.180]
fanaticism

[02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:56.620]
Is out in the open and is with other people who

[02:03:57.140 --> 02:04:02.480]
Gotta get the people fired up, okay? I'm not in a position to go out and lead a parade

[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:08.620]
Okay, and say that uh this particular organization that that particular person is doing what they're doing

[02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:13.380]
Uh, it takes it takes somebody with a lot more time than I've got on my hands

[02:04:13.380 --> 02:04:15.720]
But it takes a lot of work. It's a full-time job

[02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:21.220]
Come up to 1240 says I've got to tell you about shale now build Tanner all right. We'll listen it Tuesday

[02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:29.780]
What a crew have here today build Tanner mark mostly Cheryl v from power 96 and Stan major and I sitting in for the vacationing

[02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:33.680]
You know, Roger. We were just talking about uh Howard Stern

[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:42.640]
I'm up in uh, that's an interesting uh situation because he's got the the people in corporate are absolutely behind him

[02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:51.840]
Absolutely, that's what it takes. It does take that uh, and I think it always has taken that because I don't know if people

[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:57.540]
Understand that performing on any medium but radio is true in television

[02:04:57.540 --> 02:05:07.460]
It's a fragile thin thing. I mean you can sling hash at the diner or work at um the K-Mart store or be an executive for IBM

[02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:12.280]
And I don't think this is much of your own personal being your soul

[02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:18.920]
That's as bad to the public and there is with performing whether you see the audience don't see the audience and you need

[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:25.540]
Mentors in management. I know I have I have not I mean it appears that I've just been here since the sand

[02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:32.360]
But I've always had a tough time in my career and I treasure and value and I know he's not listening because his wife is having a baby

[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:33.440]
So I can talk about him

[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:41.500]
I treasure and value so my relationship with with the guy that owns and runs our radio station now because um he

[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:45.920]
He brings out he brings out the performer in us

[02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:51.380]
He understands what the business is all about. He's forever saying left these people who are not broadcasting get out of the business

[02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:56.800]
They have no business in there. I hear a lot of people that yeah, but it hasn't been easy. It hasn't been easy

[02:05:57.440 --> 02:05:58.940]
Um cox will tell you that

[02:05:59.560 --> 02:06:04.420]
And one of the things though and let me just talk about it. It wasn't supposed to be easy to read. Let me talk about him for a second

[02:06:04.980 --> 02:06:06.760]
One of the things about him is

[02:06:07.620 --> 02:06:09.780]
He he's very good with words

[02:06:10.460 --> 02:06:18.640]
I'm talking about Bill Tanner now. He's very good with words. He's very good with diplomacy and he's very good with telling you exactly how he feels

[02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:22.780]
No beating around the bush none of this game playing where you go

[02:06:22.780 --> 02:06:28.300]
Well, he sent he feels this way, but does he really feel this way when you walk out of the room from when he told you something

[02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:31.940]
You know how and that's very refreshing. It's very rare in his business

[02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:36.180]
And that's what makes it such a pleasure and and a lot easier to work

[02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:42.400]
A lot of the couple of people that have worked with you for you and and the fact you were talking about a mentor before

[02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:49.060]
It's very important in this business and and they have singled you out as being very important to them and their careers

[02:06:49.060 --> 02:06:56.780]
I'm proud as to people who who rip to me it is a great thrill to hear a great performer performing great

[02:06:56.780 --> 02:07:04.800]
I mean, however cliché is that sounds when Mark is on and just being and making cracking us up when you hear you guys doing a great show

[02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:07.540]
And you're new being funny. I heard Neil one day

[02:07:07.540 --> 02:07:12.240]
Just sitting there doing a bit of where he eats his sandwich and goes down the phone's line and we've all been there

[02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:16.080]
You know trying to eat your lunch, so I was going add it add it add it add it add it

[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:22.060]
Just go down the phone lines. It was so funny. It was a crack up. I get such a charge

[02:07:22.060 --> 02:07:27.500]
I mean I can have all the P&L sheets and stuff in front of me and dealing with the thing from from a management side

[02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:30.940]
But it is a performing medium and that's what I get off on

[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:37.000]
And I try to infuse that sense of excitement and creativity and performance in the people that work with me

[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:42.960]
And to me the great thrill of it all is tuning in hearing Cox just tearing up on the radio or

[02:07:43.500 --> 02:07:45.060]
Or anybody that's a man

[02:07:45.060 --> 02:07:47.740]
Or a man I wonder now he's up in New York and

[02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:53.180]
Super talent and I must tell you that she called me the other day and and she wanted to talk to me about the job that Cheryl got

[02:07:53.740 --> 02:07:59.200]
Because we're you know, I mean to me that's a great pleasure to have someone who's gone as far as she has

[02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:02.800]
They will I like to talk about coming in and coming back coming back home. Yeah

[02:08:03.380 --> 02:08:07.180]
And well take this mobile call here. He's been hanging out for a while. You there?

[02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:10.500]
No, I'm here. I'm here. Well say something

[02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:14.540]
I was going to real complaint with your show that yesterday you making light of the

[02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:16.660]
Situation over in a ram

[02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:19.240]
And yet today you're talking about

[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:22.400]
Oh, it's said so with Nelson Mandela. He

[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:26.900]
Didn't this money and he's gonna spend it on arms and everything and I might leave the killing and everything

[02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:28.980]
I see some real contradiction there real

[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:35.500]
Hypocrysthe you're so like I said you're so unconcerned. They feel light of the uh your answer to the other hand

[02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:37.940]
You're worried about yes, it may or may not occur

[02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:40.440]
Stelling of arms or whatever

[02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:44.160]
Well, Sam, why do we want to drop that bomb yesterday? Why not?

[02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:45.840]
You're right

[02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:48.780]
But nobody said that I have to be the other way

[02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:53.180]
Nobody said I had to be logical and rational when it comes to the Uranians man

[02:08:53.180 --> 02:08:58.960]
I am totally irrational. I think that we should have gone into the embassy like 24 hours after it was taken

[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:04.740]
And I still regret the fact that Carter Carter just sat on his hands

[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:08.480]
But he did that with a Muriel boat lift too. He sat on his hands and waited around

[02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:13.880]
And it's like he had to have so much advice for so long a period of time

[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:18.180]
If we knew this is an interesting point. I wonder if we knew then

[02:09:19.140 --> 02:09:26.620]
In terms of how long those hostages were going to be kept and what they would be put through if we knew then what we know now would we have done that?

[02:09:26.980 --> 02:09:27.440]
I don't know

[02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:32.840]
It's hard to gauge what a Jimmy Carter would have done. I have to all here's a man who said that big president

[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:36.520]
The United States was when I'm gonna be any more difficult to be governor of Georgia. Yeah

[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:39.620]
So here we learn trouble when you said that

[02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:40.240]
So long

[02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:45.840]
Sir are you still there? Yeah, I just have a problem with the fact I mean

[02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:52.380]
If some other country wants that like animals, I mean certainly we didn't can him be like that. It's a very emotional issue

[02:09:52.380 --> 02:09:55.940]
Sir I understand that. Yeah, you can't be very emotional now. Yeah

[02:09:55.940 --> 02:10:04.020]
Didn't you see the scenes on the network news last night of them burning the American flag and screaming the same old crap that they've been burning over here

[02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:07.700]
I mean, I mean we're burning our own flag over here with the health of difference is just a

[02:10:08.260 --> 02:10:11.920]
Little little hidden. I want the freedom to be able to do that. Okay?

[02:10:12.780 --> 02:10:14.360]
If I want to burn my own flag

[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:19.540]
Somebody else brings that I get been out of here. We got a good point to women and children, you know

[02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:26.300]
You men and tarry and reasons you don't drop the bomb government to the problems usually not people right in most cases. Thanks for calling

[02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:33.040]
But we have your Pembert Ponds you want to hear people in the embassy and that the hostages that are held have families too

[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:33.940]
Good morning

[02:10:34.620 --> 02:10:40.360]
Folks ladies and gentlemen morning. Got to make it fast. I'm coming up to the news. Okay. First of all sunny Fox

Okay, LJ New York

[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:49.500]
Well, that would be nice. That would be nice. You'd last there approximately 90 days back

[02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:58.160]
We're gonna do well that station is the second biggest toilet in the country and I won't say which one

[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:03.700]
But I will say radio here, doesn't I'm sorry. I got a run. I got the news coming up

[02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:04.620]
Thanks for calling

[02:11:05.220 --> 02:11:09.600]
Rude of may huh? And when you gotta go you gotta go you gotta go. I gotta go. I gotta take a break

[02:11:11.380 --> 02:11:13.940]
Well, we're into the one to two hours

[02:11:13.940 --> 02:11:17.440]
Mostly leaves some uh some good stuff Marvin

[02:11:18.260 --> 02:11:23.160]
Ah very good. Isn't it? See every time see that's the other reason you book these guys on the show because

[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:23.920]
Material

[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:30.660]
This material is really material half the material in this and Neil's cart rack is from mostly and we'll take more to base

[02:11:30.660 --> 02:11:33.160]
My own cart rack here too. That's a

[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:34.600]
Price is right

[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:40.100]
The price is real right. Well, we're back again. Midi from Chris

[02:11:40.100 --> 02:11:43.500]
From cuz from cuz horrible name. I know

[02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:47.520]
The last name I wanted you but Tanner wouldn't let me he didn't want to

[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:49.620]
Yeah, I know Douglas

[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:54.120]
Mindy Douglas very came to the same thing with Jerry Seinfeld

[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:58.400]
He was doing a talk show and Jerry was his guest and said that's a terrible name

[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:01.420]
He can't just sign a failed maybe but not a fine

[02:12:01.420 --> 02:12:05.920]
He said hey, that's my name. Why can you do? I was Mindy Douglas for years

[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:09.920]
I was Mindy Douglas my first two years or my first year and a half of radio when I moved to Miami

[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:11.160]
I started working at Parano6

[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:14.600]
Tanner hired me and he said okay, so Mindy Douglas is a nice name

[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:18.100]
But what's the real name and I said froncus and he died laughing in the spot

[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:22.660]
That's you know you're you're funny and you've got personality and froncus is it

[02:12:22.660 --> 02:12:25.500]
You look like a froncus. Oh, thanks fan

[02:12:25.500 --> 02:12:30.340]
No one's like Dominique hot 105 Mindy and Mallow

[02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:31.380]
My right

[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:37.480]
And hot is still hot hot hot and still hot and staying hot very hot. We just plan to keep it going

[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:40.180]
So doing very well. Are you playing two live crew?

[02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:44.220]
Yes, we're still playing two live crew. We're a clean version. The clean version

[02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:45.300]
I don't think we ever played the door

[02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:53.640]
You know what's so amazing to me and I brought this article in it within what was it people magazine with Madonna and Warren on the cover?

[02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:55.080]
Yes, somebody actually

[02:12:55.780 --> 02:13:02.000]
Listen to the two live crew version. We so horny be ex-rated version to tell us that

[02:13:02.540 --> 02:13:05.700]
There were 226 uses of the word f

[02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:09.780]
The f word somebody actually went through the counter and counted it

[02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:15.500]
87 descriptions of oral sex one mentioned of incessant goes on and on and on listing

[02:13:15.940 --> 02:13:21.640]
What was mentioned and how many times too bad they can't just index the record to the people who are so interested and go right to the oral sex

[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:25.400]
Mentally whatever they like exactly right. Well, mint is here. We're going to talk about two live crew and

[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:30.620]
Whatever else we can figure out to talk to but does she think it's a little overkill on the f word

[02:13:31.580 --> 02:13:31.980]
Major

[02:13:33.460 --> 02:13:35.120]
All major overkill

[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:39.720]
Definitely major overkill when they do their live gig do they do that

[02:13:39.780 --> 02:13:45.960]
Much or do they tone it down a little bit their live gig is extremely live and it's very live

[02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:52.600]
And it's just what you'd expect in the same thing the performances in Hollywood and at club new was just after they were

[02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:54.820]
Band so to speak so

[02:13:55.460 --> 02:14:00.620]
Band, Navarro was a major portion of their show. Yes, he was he ain't they got people quite excited

[02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:03.080]
It's a fear going in the audience

[02:14:03.620 --> 02:14:09.000]
You know it's amazing how Brauer County has become the Boston of the 1990s

[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.160]
No longer banded Boston outspaned and

[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:14.260]
Well, we know how it's true and it's not it's not the reputation that I mean

[02:14:14.260 --> 02:14:18.800]
I've lived in South Florida most of my life and certainly since reputation that I would like us to have I know all this

[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:23.420]
I was listening to you all earlier talking with with Mark and then Bill and Cheryl and it

[02:14:23.420 --> 02:14:27.400]
I love South Florida. I it's not the reputation that I want for our community

[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:32.240]
We have such a great chance here to be in the forefront of so many things. We're not in New York and we're not not Los Angeles

[02:14:32.780 --> 02:14:37.200]
But you don't have to be you know, we have a lot of wonderful things a lot of exciting cultural events going on here

[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:42.120]
Why do we have to have such censorship since censorship going on? Oh wait wait till

[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:45.520]
Nick and his buddies start checking out the bathing suits on the beach

[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:53.000]
The easterings you know you've got enough oil from seller door had a really good quote in in the newspaper when all this was coming out

[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.120]
He said you know, I've been in the concert business a long time

[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:59.220]
And I can understand concert some concerts being banned in the South

[02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:04.480]
Some parts portions of the South the deep South but never did I think it would happen in Brauer County

[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:11.380]
You know Bobby Brown was arrested in a part of Georgia for doing one of his very sexual dances toward to one of his songs

[02:15:11.380 --> 02:15:14.020]
You know a couple of months back and it's happening

[02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:17.560]
You know it's happening more and more frequently and hey folks if you're scared about the two-life crew

[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:22.080]
There's more of this coming now more than music but more of the banning well what about

[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:27.300]
If you want to get into Elvis was only shot from the the waist up on Ed Sullivan

[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:29.880]
Jamoris how many times how long did you wait?

[02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:33.400]
But how many times was Jamoris and pulled off of stage off of the stage

[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:39.520]
I don't know many times what like Tanner said the pendulum swings and now it's time to go we went through the whole

[02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:41.320]
generation was spit on

[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:43.800]
or worse and

[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:49.260]
Things were loose and free free love remember the pre-leg generation. I was too young for that

[02:15:49.260 --> 02:15:52.260]
You two both went through and it made it open

[02:15:52.260 --> 02:15:54.420]
You know you look back and all the way around the world

[02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:58.440]
And I love loosely wiki luci couldn't even sleep in the same bed

[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:00.020]
You could mention the word pregnant

[02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:00.560]
That's right

[02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:05.960]
She couldn't want to mention that one and the old pendulum is starting to swing back again for him

[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:09.740]
But isn't also the other extent of that is doesn't some things go in full?

[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:12.180]
Oh, yeah, absolutely, but how long is it gonna be then?

[02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:12.540]

[02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:17.240]
That's the thing I don't know but the problem is that that in some ways it's it's almost

[02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:20.760]
It's not a terrible thing that any the AIDS crisis for example has brought back

[02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:26.960]
Monogamy and relationships and people cannot be as into as into casual sex and they can't be as

[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:33.480]
Unconcerned about their sexual health so the relationships are more and style big weddings are coming back

[02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:33.880]
You know

[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:38.120]
That's not necessarily bad that that's that's a healthy thing perhaps

[02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:42.900]
But when it affects everything else, you know that's something that's very difficult to reverse too

[02:16:42.900 --> 02:16:43.520]
right

[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:49.280]
Very very full one piece bathing suits are coming back. No boy in the 40s

[02:16:49.980 --> 02:16:54.500]
You know they I saw normal Kamali's new line. I really are back. I didn't really know that

[02:16:54.500 --> 02:17:00.560]
We've got two lines open here in Dave to call it 7519463 a line in Broward

[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:01.520]
524

[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:09.440]
W I O D. Let's take a call here got a mobile line you there mobile? Yes, I am. How you doing fine? How are you?

[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:10.100]
I'm on

[02:17:10.100 --> 02:17:15.660]
Visiting from Virginia and I've every time I get down here about 14 weeks out of the year. I try to listen to shows

[02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:19.640]
So it's always kind of interesting to see different personalities changes and like

[02:17:20.180 --> 02:17:21.780]
You know roll a phone or something

[02:17:21.780 --> 02:17:24.420]
They would like to talk about this no-sumindella thing

[02:17:26.020 --> 02:17:31.220]
You know in the past I will would have been makes I don't know if I can expand like there's a rock on roll thing

[02:17:31.220 --> 02:17:35.860]
But certainly I would appreciate anybody who's gone through with melcom and melcom through

[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:38.140]
But when he's come out with all this

[02:17:38.940 --> 02:17:40.860]
Has about is about

[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:41.940]
Communists

[02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:43.960]
And a supporter of Kada

[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:47.160]
Cash from support and you got a you got a wonder

[02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:47.740]
Um

[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:53.860]
How in the world we could support such a thing and by frankly in that regard I would agree with y'all

[02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:56.080]
I would certainly like to

[02:17:57.540 --> 02:17:58.040]
commend

[02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:00.220]
Miami on not

[02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:05.900]
Welcome the amount of official basis for me as a as a visor they should and

[02:18:05.900 --> 02:18:07.500]
somewhat embarrassed that

[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:10.160]
We would receive them as the third

[02:18:10.940 --> 02:18:15.800]
So William basically to make a statement before congress at the state gets

[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:19.880]
Not appropriate for an avowed communist and in a much that the

[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:24.940]
Communist world is changing and even the own communist party is turning

[02:18:24.940 --> 02:18:29.420]
Turning code on her on her own party because look at what the floor of a child has done

[02:18:30.580 --> 02:18:32.280]
I think that support

[02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:36.740]
El смindella is not the right thing to do on a pre-s teacher comment. Okay, sir

[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:40.280]
Let me get out of that line because you say now

[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:47.440]
I think a lot of it has to do with what Nelson Mandela went through which is why they're holding in such him in such a reverence

[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:51.720]
And I can I understand this this colors point of view, but I gotta say one thing

[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:57.020]
I'm not thrilled yet believe me. I do not support the PLO and I do not support Castro and very

[02:18:57.600 --> 02:19:05.440]
Very anti anti-PLO anti-Castro, but I appreciate that there is a there is a big segment of our community black white and Latin

[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:11.180]
Who do respect Nelson Mandela and I don't know if I am thrilled that there'll be no official welcome

[02:19:11.180 --> 02:19:16.540]
I'm I'm I understand that we will not we don't have a hero in Nelson Mandela who's perfect

[02:19:17.580 --> 02:19:18.780]
He he does

[02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:27.120]
Support certain people who are very volatile who are are negative in many respect who are supporting his cause who are supporting his cause when

[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:32.720]
In the paper this morning's Florida. We still have millions of dollars in businesses that invest in South Florida

[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:35.000]
My proud of that no I am not that really

[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:43.440]
Instead of supporting South Africa exactly. I'm not proud of that at all. Are we gonna have you know pagan perfect pagan statues that we can put up in respect and that that will be perfect

[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:47.660]
None of us are and Nelson Mandela certainly is a buddy did go through something very important

[02:19:47.660 --> 02:19:51.480]
I think that it's kind of a shame that South Florida isn't welcoming

[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:54.320]
Nelson Mandela in any official capacity

[02:19:55.260 --> 02:19:57.060]
We're the only one in the in the

[02:19:57.060 --> 02:20:03.480]
He got to separate the politics from this kind of thing and I was I was kind of shocked

[02:20:04.100 --> 02:20:09.520]
Well then again, I guess I wasn't to see that mayor swore as through in real quick on this so-called

[02:20:10.100 --> 02:20:14.000]
Thing the statement that they put out. I mean here's the mayor of Miami who

[02:20:14.580 --> 02:20:20.080]
Not too long ago when to run for governor was thinking about running for governor. So he got a lot of the national press

[02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:21.600]
Yeah, and he has political

[02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:26.640]
ambitions that go beyond being the mayor and yet he looks like a

[02:20:27.900 --> 02:20:32.320]
Havana city councilman, you know by making this kind of statement and

[02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:41.600]
They I don't understand it. These people under Batista if you go back that he's the had the worst

[02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:42.560]
regime

[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:45.280]
just pull a crooks

[02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:48.840]
and just all kinds of

[02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:50.780]
of right wing

[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:54.120]
Dictatorship type crap that was going on and

[02:20:55.440 --> 02:21:02.180]
It seems like the Cubans can only settle for one extreme on the left or one extreme on the right

[02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:07.680]
And they're now in a country where we don't have an extreme on the left or we don't have an extreme on the right

[02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:09.360]
And they should realize

[02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:18.820]
That a Mandela has a right to come here and speak it is just as they have a right to demonstrate against his appearance here

[02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:27.540]
That's what this country is all about. It is the same exact problem that is splitting apart South Florida that is that is causing all the racial tension and the ethnic tension that we feel it explode

[02:21:27.540 --> 02:21:29.560]
Yes, I'm the right to come here and

[02:21:30.180 --> 02:21:31.280]
Say whatever he wants to

[02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:38.380]
You don't you don't go or not to go right exactly. It's like the CDs you don't need to buy the movies you don't need to watch

[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:40.620]
The strip shows you don't need to go to

[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:45.640]
It's a one-sixteen at six ten w i r d. We'll be back after this

[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:50.760]
The scientists have warned us that as women we face some pretty serious risk

[02:21:50.760 --> 02:21:55.700]
We are vulnerable to osteoporosis the painful dedilitating loss of bone tissue

[02:21:55.700 --> 02:22:00.180]
Today's one of the only recommended treatments has been calcium supplementation

[02:22:00.180 --> 02:22:06.580]
Unfortunately, the only calcium previously available had uncomfortable even unhealthy side effects

[02:22:06.580 --> 02:22:10.040]
And some of those supplements couldn't even be absorbed by the body

[02:22:10.040 --> 02:22:12.380]
Now thankfully there is good news

[02:22:12.380 --> 02:22:15.140]
Now, thankfully there is still to count

[02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:19.220]
Citrical is the first brand of calcium citrate in the United States

[02:22:19.220 --> 02:22:24.220]
We search so that's the kind of calcium expected in a fight against osteoporosis

[02:22:24.780 --> 02:22:26.580]
Not all calcium supplements are alike

[02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:30.780]
Citrical is absorbed over two times better than other calcium supplements

[02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:33.720]
Citrical does not cause stomach upset or bloating

[02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:39.000]
And because citrical has half the size of other calcium products it's very easy to take

[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.320]
Citrical by mission pharmacol

[02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:43.580]
Thankfully it's in very good news for women

[02:22:45.700 --> 02:22:48.060]
You are right on the ball on that one Marvin

[02:22:48.060 --> 02:22:48.820]
Hi Marvin

[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:54.020]
Many funkists here from hot 105 were sort of continuing our conversations

[02:22:54.620 --> 02:22:58.100]
I think it's amazing to talk to you too about getting up at four in the morning

[02:22:58.100 --> 02:23:00.800]
Too bad, but what is life?

[02:23:01.100 --> 02:23:01.960]
What kind of lifestyle?

[02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:03.340]
No life, you have no life

[02:23:03.340 --> 02:23:06.340]
You know, I could never see doing anything else because it's really it's a

[02:23:06.340 --> 02:23:09.580]
Every day is different you talk to amazing people you mean amazing people

[02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:15.420]
The one thing that really sucks about morning shows is getting up at four ten in the morning

[02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:18.840]
I'm not happy. Let me learn about that. Oh boy. I had two alarms

[02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:23.960]
Going off just in case because I was so paranoid that I wouldn't I wouldn't miss it

[02:23:23.960 --> 02:23:25.420]
I think I was just telling you out in the hallway

[02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:29.220]
Samuel appreciate this but the few mornings of my life that I've overslapped until

[02:23:29.960 --> 02:23:33.040]
530 which is when our show begins at hot 105 you know

[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:35.320]
Malawa call me and say are you coming in?

[02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:37.340]
And believe me Keith has only happened once

[02:23:38.940 --> 02:23:43.380]
And I'll wake up at 530 and be there you know at 550 because you just throw in anything and get in there

[02:23:43.380 --> 02:23:48.540]
But it's amazing. I feel like a million dollars that day. I mean I'm rested. I look fresh. No bags

[02:23:48.540 --> 02:23:55.080]
No fine lines no creases. I'm ready to go. That's the thing the bags the bags waking up I have more eye cream than

[02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:59.800]
The Chanel cream. I understand that let's take another call here. We got a mobile

[02:24:00.300 --> 02:24:06.160]
We lost him. No, he's back again. Mobile. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. How are you fine?

[02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:10.660]
Okay, I was I was listening all this about this man number thing

[02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:16.720]
Okay, at least I mean you people shit encourage this guy and

[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:22.880]
You know this guy is not talking with two or three miles or two or three tongue in his mouth

[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:28.560]
He is saying whatever he believes in and if he is a politician like

[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:31.960]
Hushfield like Alex Dowd up here

[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:39.020]
Which are planning not to welcome him. I think that's a good thing because he should not be welcome with by these groups anywhere

[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:43.740]
Because these people have no characters you can buy them

[02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:49.800]
You know, I tell them. Yeah, you can buy them if you have the right price and you're right money in your pocket and

[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:54.800]
I think the guy whatever he is he may not you know

[02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:56.320]
Can go with us

[02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:57.760]
But he has to write to talk

[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:07.020]
But whatever he says like he said it and although he's gonna take a loss of not getting that much money if he

[02:25:07.020 --> 02:25:08.500]
You know get it to himself

[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:14.540]
So I think a lot of the reason he's coming down here. It is money, but it's not money

[02:25:14.540 --> 02:25:21.800]
So uh this this spirit the spirit of getting people riled up to put down a part time right

[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:25.780]
That's what if he goes over back you will see

[02:25:25.780 --> 02:25:31.400]
Yitzag Shamed has the same character. He was a terrorist also. He bonds for many hotels and all that

[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:35.520]
But now he's a leader and he is you know, he's a big thing and

[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:40.260]
Adaparte is a lead as a terrorist although they look the same and if

[02:25:40.260 --> 02:25:45.860]
Shamed goes in his bathroom takes his clothes out. He will look all I think he will look more terrorists than

[02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:47.400]
Adaparte is

[02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:48.240]
So

[02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:52.240]
You know, it's if you if you read newspaper and you go back

[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:58.800]
I read behind the lines you see all these people they are the same faces same characters

[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:04.060]
But different different time they talk different. Well, thank you. Thank you much

[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:11.780]
That's the terminology is so interesting because uh the Nicaraguan would claim that the contres were terrorists

[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:14.860]
We claimed their freedom fighters. Mm-hmm say

[02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:18.480]
We all in their own respect. That's it. It's all about opening up a dialogue

[02:26:18.480 --> 02:26:21.800]
And if you if you fight to keep a dialogue close you learn nothing and you become

[02:26:22.620 --> 02:26:27.280]
You become a complete intellectual zero and you live in a very limited blind world

[02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:33.580]
There's one thing. I'll say about the mandela's they tell you where they stand. I mean they didn't come over here and pull any punches

[02:26:34.740 --> 02:26:40.520]
He's rather restrained. I think people were surprised though. I think they were taken by surprise by a lot of his comments

[02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:46.680]
You know why because the news media has played him up as the next that right my

[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:55.760]
Pacific kind of person and when she when when when mandela came over here and was put on the spot about her political beliefs

[02:26:55.760 --> 02:26:59.220]
And she came out with this revolutionary rhetoric

[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:00.300]
Uh

[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:08.380]
It didn't get that much play in this country. So people aren't the I don't think if you if you took a man on the street pole

[02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:11.340]
And ask the question is

[02:27:13.620 --> 02:27:18.460]
Mandela's wife and about an outspoken revolutionary communist

[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:22.480]
People would like to you and say first of all they'd say who she

[02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:25.140]
Second of all they'd say well, I don't know

[02:27:25.740 --> 02:27:31.260]
So I don't think the American public is really informed and she's really toned down her comments a lot

[02:27:31.260 --> 02:27:36.360]
Any she makes a lot during this whole tour. Let's take another call here from Hollywood. Good morning

[02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:43.660]
Good morning. Good afternoon. How are you doing fine? Yeah, I'd like to talk to you about this mandela coming down here

[02:27:44.420 --> 02:27:46.700]
I'm a ex Vietnam bet

[02:27:46.700 --> 02:27:51.620]
And I don't believe that our government should have walked in with open arms

[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:56.280]
In front of our congress this morning. I think the man's a terrorist

[02:27:56.280 --> 02:28:01.040]
I think he's going to use the money to go back and destroy the nation. Oh, I I agree with you there

[02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:04.300]
He's definitely going to use the money for for a amount of arms

[02:28:04.860 --> 02:28:07.760]
Absolutely, and I think it's going to cause more bloodshed and more harm

[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:11.940]
I think our government could have done much more for him rather than paying them 10 million dollars

[02:28:13.740 --> 02:28:17.800]
I agree with you. I absolutely agree with you. I don't know the answer though

[02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:19.960]
I don't really know what the answer is either

[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:26.360]
But I don't think that as a people we should open our arms to everybody just because we happen to embrace one view that they might hold

[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:28.940]
You have to look at the whole picture and say hey

[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:32.700]
You know this man has a good point

[02:28:32.700 --> 02:28:39.800]
But he has several bad points. So what are we going to do? I think again as Stan was just mentioning before we're just now seeing those

[02:28:40.380 --> 02:28:42.680]
Those sort of not I don't want to call them bad points

[02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:45.960]
But getting perspectives that we didn't get before

[02:28:47.100 --> 02:28:52.200]
When he first came over here everything was with hearts and flowers everything was was wonderful

[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:58.860]
Everything was terrific and the more he spoke the more you listened you you began to to realize there were a couple of

[02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:04.060]
Of tinks in the armor there were a couple of questions that that people it was started to raise

[02:29:04.060 --> 02:29:11.100]
I didn't know that before absolutely. I didn't either. I thought that this man was was a good role model

[02:29:11.100 --> 02:29:14.160]
That's because the media or his people and I think

[02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:16.420]
But did the media know though?

[02:29:17.140 --> 02:29:18.500]
I don't know. I don't really know

[02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:21.100]
You know we turned to the media for information

[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:25.120]
But so many people didn't really they knew that there was a part-time satathical

[02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:29.300]
They didn't realize what we're going on people don't read inside of the Miami hero

[02:29:29.300 --> 02:29:36.260]
They don't know and they don't care and they don't read the New York Times. Oh, I understand I understand that and I grew within 100 percent

[02:29:36.260 --> 02:29:41.840]
But still the majority that the people in this nation depend upon all the media the radio the TV

[02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:47.760]
But they're movies or whatever magazine and TV guides sir. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. I agree with that

[02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:49.080]
Where we get our education?

[02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:53.320]
As I speak what magazine does Randy heaven front of it? That's right

[02:29:55.480 --> 02:29:56.500]
I don't want it

[02:29:56.500 --> 02:30:00.540]
I think the line of the communication ought to be left of them

[02:30:00.540 --> 02:30:04.240]
But I don't think that when a person's not ahead of state or ahead of a government

[02:30:04.240 --> 02:30:07.320]
I don't think this issue should have been walking the way they have another thing

[02:30:07.320 --> 02:30:11.220]
He deserves the platform. Don't you the you wouldn't shut him up, right? I would know

[02:30:11.220 --> 02:30:13.660]
I would absolutely not shut him up. He's got the right to speak

[02:30:14.160 --> 02:30:15.540]
But I don't think that he should be

[02:30:16.460 --> 02:30:18.700]
be entitled to the same

[02:30:19.780 --> 02:30:23.820]
Privileges or benefits that I had to stay received this man's not ahead of state

[02:30:24.520 --> 02:30:29.360]
I agree with you certainly I heard you commenting earlier that he is certainly not a Martin Luther King

[02:30:29.360 --> 02:30:30.260]
And I agree with that

[02:30:30.860 --> 02:30:35.460]
1000 percent because Martin Luther King would have never agreed with the violence of this man

[02:30:36.380 --> 02:30:44.560]
Again, he's been in a time war for 27 years and if you've been looking out from out from the inside of Bard windows your perspective may be different

[02:30:45.180 --> 02:30:52.080]
Yeah, but we he himself was surprised by the reaction that he's getting. Oh, I don't doubt that I don't doubt that a bit

[02:30:52.080 --> 02:30:58.080]
And I think probably a lot of the reaction is the strictly because he is a black elitir

[02:30:58.820 --> 02:31:03.840]
A black leader who who supports the Dell, Maulmar and the other

[02:31:03.840 --> 02:31:10.680]
Absolutely, and I cannot condone that in any way shape or form regardless of what he condones it for what his beliefs are

[02:31:10.680 --> 02:31:12.720]
Those people are terrorists

[02:31:13.480 --> 02:31:16.580]
They've done a lot of evil things we've done a lot of evil things

[02:31:17.280 --> 02:31:20.480]
But we certainly aren't gonna you know two evils don't make a good

[02:31:21.640 --> 02:31:22.120]
Thanks

[02:31:23.220 --> 02:31:28.160]
You know, Randy what I don't hear anyone talking about it all is there's a whole big flat

[02:31:28.160 --> 02:31:34.440]
We're all talking about no for Mandela. Should we welcome him? Shouldn't we welcome him? What's gonna happen? Once he leaves

[02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:38.200]
What's gonna happen? What's gonna happen nothing nothing at all?

[02:31:38.460 --> 02:31:45.180]
Unless people get involved and that's the fight of the 80s and 90s and not enough people do I agree with him

[02:31:45.180 --> 02:31:49.420]
It doesn't affect you personally. Yeah, therefore you're not gonna do anything about it

[02:31:49.420 --> 02:31:57.200]
I think his trip definitely will present an awareness get people more educated get people more robbed up then maybe

[02:31:57.200 --> 02:32:01.240]
I don't know how to end the part time. I have no idea and I haven't read

[02:32:02.060 --> 02:32:06.860]
Anywhere any anybody's version of how to do it either I don't know

[02:32:06.860 --> 02:32:10.700]
I don't know it's a difficult problem and it's a difficult situation to be in

[02:32:10.700 --> 02:32:15.340]
But I think it again going right back to where I started from I think it's wrong

[02:32:15.340 --> 02:32:20.860]
That our government is acting like they're condoning the police of this guy whether our president gets on there

[02:32:20.860 --> 02:32:23.320]
Says we had a disagreement you had a disagreement

[02:32:23.320 --> 02:32:26.860]
But you had a demand ten million dollars a couple of months ago or a month ago

[02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:32.920]
Yeah, I agree. You know, I mean that's that's my money. That's your money. That's all it taxpayers money

[02:32:33.400 --> 02:32:35.120]
That's not what our country believes in

[02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:41.920]
I mean we keep talking about we don't we we want to fight terrorism around the world and everything else and then we're supporting it

[02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:44.080]
I mean for Christchurch what about the IRA?

[02:32:44.700 --> 02:32:47.580]
Why are we giving those people such a hard time when they come over here to

[02:32:48.440 --> 02:32:53.040]
To try and get funds for their fight. I mean it's the same thing isn't it?

[02:32:53.160 --> 02:32:56.380]
Well, listen sir. I got a break here, but I appreciate your call. Okay. Thank you

[02:32:57.700 --> 02:33:02.920]
129 we're gonna take a break and we're gonna come back with more with Mindy from kids from hot 105

[02:33:02.920 --> 02:33:07.140]
And major and I on new stock radio six ten W I O D

[02:33:07.940 --> 02:33:08.340]
Thanks

[02:33:08.340 --> 02:33:14.140]
Got great. It does get confusing and yes G Michael will be on again tonight. He's on tonight. Oh no

[02:33:14.140 --> 02:33:18.720]
He's not on tonight. That's right baseball tonight Yankees and Brewer at 735

[02:33:19.540 --> 02:33:20.860]
Like Yankees and Brewer's okay

[02:33:20.860 --> 02:33:28.520]
I got it Amber is that of course you can tell that story that you told off the air that's funny you like that story

[02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:32.280]
That's great. We're talking about oh England. Yeah, we're just talking about England

[02:33:33.540 --> 02:33:37.800]
Mindy was telling us that he met some nice people there. I met a fabulous guy over there

[02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:46.000]
Fabulous three fabulous guy and I was saying that I did some work for the BBC at one point in time and it met some fabulous guys over there

[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:52.740]
But my name in England in New Zealand I found out later when the the white bread or the whip bread race was here

[02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:55.100]
Randy means hornies. Oh my

[02:33:55.860 --> 02:33:59.480]
Couldn't really have a real good conversation or a relationship

[02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:04.760]
You're wondering why people kept laughing at you. Absolutely. Your phone was ringing also. I say hi. I'm Randy and they're off

[02:34:07.560 --> 02:34:11.480]
They were through to see me. I'll tell you so it really didn't work

[02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:18.020]
I'm gonna have to find another country that it really doesn't mean much and they were appalled that my parents would name me that

[02:34:18.020 --> 02:34:23.780]
I love the name Randy for a lady. They were absolutely appalled that someone would name a name a child horny

[02:34:24.900 --> 02:34:28.020]
You know what I'm saying? You're listening to the phone calls

[02:34:28.020 --> 02:34:30.060]
Before I'm so Randy

[02:34:31.860 --> 02:34:40.820]
Fine. Yeah, listen about Nelson Mandela and Wendy Mandela. Mm-hmm. Okay. It's Winnie Mandela. I'm Mindy. She's Winnie. Oh Mindy.

[02:34:40.940 --> 02:34:44.100]
Why is he Mandela? He's Barbie. That's okay. Okay

[02:34:44.100 --> 02:34:50.580]
One thing this might not be very popular to say but I guess part of the reason that he is as popular as he is because

[02:34:51.300 --> 02:34:51.980]
I'm fact that

[02:34:52.580 --> 02:34:58.000]
He was in prisons for what 27 years? 27 years. Right and the fact that he's also blessed

[02:34:58.020 --> 02:35:05.120]
And there's also there's a tremendous amount of guilt here in this country about that. I don't think we feel guilty for that sir

[02:35:05.780 --> 02:35:08.940]
Well, no, no, no, that's specifically dad. I think it there's

[02:35:09.460 --> 02:35:14.500]
You know it's still there, but the thing is say um why him

[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:18.520]
Well, he pointed out the the chief the Zulu tribe

[02:35:19.060 --> 02:35:22.620]
I'm not gonna try hit pronouncing his name because he's not as visible

[02:35:23.140 --> 02:35:25.580]
Pardon? He's not as visible. He's not as vocal

[02:35:26.300 --> 02:35:28.160]
And he's not in it as international

[02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:34.480]
Well, I guess though, but still that the point is he he heads up to try it as well

[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:40.080]
I always think he's even though he's not as vocal is just as important. It's not as more important

[02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:43.620]
Absolutely, but he's he's been very low key compared to Nelson Mandela

[02:35:43.620 --> 02:35:48.880]
Let me lady you think that that this country feels guilty. I don't think it's no no. No, not very guilty

[02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:50.080]
I just even slightly

[02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:55.380]
But the bottom line here is that you've got the the African-American population of this country

[02:35:55.580 --> 02:35:57.240]
With a very serious lack of role models

[02:35:57.700 --> 02:36:07.960]
You've got a serious problem with the 18 to 34-year-old black male and if there there is an international figure who has put his life up to a very good cause in a very good reason and something that many people can embrace and

[02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:13.660]
So that's what they're embracing. It's not guilt. They're embracing the ideal what he stood for what he believes in

[02:36:14.580 --> 02:36:15.020]
unfortunately

[02:36:16.260 --> 02:36:22.440]
When he speaks more and more and more of his philosophy that we didn't know about is starting to come out

[02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:25.980]
That's what starting to get people pretty pretty uncomfortable

[02:36:26.660 --> 02:36:28.200]
That's the important thing

[02:36:29.140 --> 02:36:29.700]
Also

[02:36:30.420 --> 02:36:37.420]
There's other things also going on in Africa that are probably just as important I think like like the Civil War in Ethiopia

[02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:43.180]
Then nobody wants to talk about it seems where they use food primarily as weapon that is the government there

[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:48.100]
And nobody really says much about that at all. At least I haven't heard anything lately on it

[02:36:48.720 --> 02:36:49.900]
But you won't sir

[02:36:50.900 --> 02:36:53.260]
Probably not and you won't

[02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:56.600]
Yeah, it's it's not as uh you see occasional report on

[02:36:56.600 --> 02:37:01.980]
Television yeah, that's it on PBS. Yeah, I mean, they all are that kind of yeah

[02:37:01.980 --> 02:37:05.700]
Then it's see it it goes if

[02:37:06.220 --> 02:37:12.120]
50,000 people had been killed in an earthquake in India it wouldn't have been news in this country

[02:37:12.700 --> 02:37:14.460]
But it happened to happen in Iran

[02:37:14.460 --> 02:37:18.500]
You disagree with you don't lie really disagree with you. What about when the uh

[02:37:18.500 --> 02:37:21.000]
Well gosh union carbine

[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:28.440]
Explode in how many but that was an American code how many people yeah, but you can't say that was an American comedy which could be good could be sued

[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:35.180]
It could be the degree of the incident like that earthquake was pretty big and the number of people were killed

[02:37:35.180 --> 02:37:38.220]
But on the other hand it was in Iran and there is that

[02:37:38.220 --> 02:37:40.480]
There's a lot of mixed feelings about that

[02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:45.120]
What it caused us to do is what were some people in our cause to do with Nelson Mandela

[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:51.160]
There is a definite problem with Iran they embrace political views and have hated the United States for as long as anyone can remember

[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:55.600]
Yet these people are suffering injury. There's disease. There's pestilence. They had their homeless

[02:37:55.600 --> 02:37:59.320]
You see people to think well, what do I do now? I don't know people

[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:06.040]
But I don't like what they think so what matters more that they're people or that or that they uh they embrace the iatola

[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:10.800]
I would imagine that most of those people that weren't in region did not

[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:17.880]
Subscribe to the iatola sleeves completely like the flag burning the one I think their biggest problem was just it was interraving

[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:21.080]
But Stan feels very strongly about this

[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:28.100]
Sure, and thank you for calling just the same like all you know all Iran and don't feel the same way politically because some of them aren't even

[02:38:28.100 --> 02:38:32.960]
Areian I would imagine some of the people in that that part of Iran aren't you know Persian

[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:40.700]
I think again their biggest concern in life is how do I get set every day and how do I say warm or whatever it is

[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:46.280]
I camel into the garage. I think most of politics in Iran is based roughly around Iran

[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:49.420]
Okay, I'll let you guys go. Well, thank you

[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:52.840]
Thank you for letting us go. Unfortunately, that's right

[02:38:53.700 --> 02:38:55.900]
Government's action a lot of people pay for it

[02:38:56.480 --> 02:38:59.460]
I in this case the Stan wants to drop the bomb, but

[02:39:00.020 --> 02:39:01.260]
Put them out of their misery

[02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:06.980]
But I've wanted to do that for a long time. Okay. Well the nearest quake doesn't really make a difference at this point

[02:39:06.980 --> 02:39:12.880]
I mean wanted to do that forever didn't take a lot of people did also I was in a house when I told a diet

[02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:16.980]
I celebrated I popped a court. Although today they were jumping up and down

[02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:20.000]
I still I still think that what's happened over there though

[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:23.040]
I mean I feel for those people and perhaps they didn't embrace

[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:24.840]
By the way you talk about a media

[02:39:26.300 --> 02:39:34.280]
Made personality. How about the Iatola? Mm-hmm well camping out in Paris. Oh, I've nobody ever heard of me before the TV cameras caught him in Paris

[02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:36.680]
And then boy he was subbling all the time

[02:39:38.260 --> 02:39:46.240]
Visible if you if that's the word. I mean his doctor and his still quoted still a major force almost as big as Jessica Han got

[02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:52.000]
Just almost that's scary. Let's check out this mobile here. Hello good afternoon

[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:53.120]
Hi, Sam and company

[02:39:53.940 --> 02:39:55.060]
question about

[02:39:55.060 --> 02:39:57.280]
Nelson Mandela and rot and

[02:39:57.280 --> 02:39:58.240]
He's the

[02:39:59.240 --> 02:40:00.700]
Nelson Mandela and rock

[02:40:00.700 --> 02:40:04.000]
among the rock musicians and

[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:07.940]
And the guy coming from that I don't know it just

[02:40:07.940 --> 02:40:14.580]
Hello, I just wonder what you've put in that connection about Nelson Mandela and rock. It's Nelson's new group that he's

[02:40:14.580 --> 02:40:21.800]
Redezing it's Nelson and Winnie. Yes, goodbye sir. We're not quite sure if you're listening either. Oh, let's go to Cooper City

[02:40:22.540 --> 02:40:27.280]
Hello, are you there? Hello? Hello? I'm home of company. Oh my

[02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:33.620]
They're all calling up they sure are a Paul call Paul. How do you feel about Mandela? How do you feel about anything Paul?

[02:40:34.440 --> 02:40:39.780]
At 610 W I O D we're gonna take a break and we'll be back more with Mindy from hot 105

[02:40:40.820 --> 02:40:49.840]
What are we gonna do tomorrow by the way? I don't know. What do you think? Let's show up and see what happens? Okay

[02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:55.640]
You don't be plans yet. I can always take a poll on the Mandela's what whether or not

[02:40:56.780 --> 02:40:58.880]
Like a girl they're gonna make a difference here

[02:41:00.060 --> 02:41:05.380]
I don't know. I think that we should try to find a Nelson Mandela satin jacket. Yeah, that would be great

[02:41:05.780 --> 02:41:10.460]
That would be that would be nice for 50 bucks. You can get your all your Mandela paraphernalia

[02:41:10.460 --> 02:41:13.680]
Sorry, you know, I can get all of that buttons. What have you?

[02:41:14.500 --> 02:41:18.880]
Let's see. Let's take a line here mobile. Hey, how you doing Randy? Fine. How are you?

[02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:26.640]
I'm gonna extend how you okay listen. I have a opposing point of view. I disagree that they I think they should have a part type

[02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:33.360]
I think that the reason that I disagree with that is because most of the people there are very animalistic and

[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:34.640]
very

[02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:38.480]
Underdeveloped and I really think if you got your sheets on sir

[02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:42.700]
No, I'm not even burning your costs. I just want to give you an opposing view. Uh-huh

[02:41:42.700 --> 02:41:46.560]
Okay, and I really think that if the white people are so outnumbered

[02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:50.460]
Same way as the Jewish people that they would be

[02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:54.420]
destroyed by the blacks who can't even get along with themselves there

[02:41:54.420 --> 02:42:02.540]
And you know what one of the major problems that they have over in South Africa is the fighting and the conflict within the tribes themselves

[02:42:02.540 --> 02:42:03.640]
Sounds like Israel

[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:09.020]
No, it's not like that. No, no, I'm not saying that at all. I'm not saying that I don't know. I'm not saying that.

[02:42:09.020 --> 02:42:14.060]
The big white minority in the government has to make some changes

[02:42:14.060 --> 02:42:18.360]
Because right now the world is focused on their situation.

[02:42:18.940 --> 02:42:26.340]
The question is if they start to elect or to appoint black officials to the government.

[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:29.620]
Pretty soon they'll be elected out.

[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:30.260]
That's right.

[02:42:30.540 --> 02:42:32.360]
The white minority will be done.

[02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:33.100]
That's my point.

[02:42:33.420 --> 02:42:36.320]
And then therefore they will be at the mercy of all the blacks.

[02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:37.800]
And I'm not saying it because they're black.

[02:42:37.980 --> 02:42:39.520]
Let's say they were Indians or Chinese.

[02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:39.980]
Whatever.

[02:42:40.420 --> 02:42:43.520]
You cannot ignore the majority in a country.

[02:42:44.540 --> 02:42:46.260]
You cannot ignore the majority.

[02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:51.620]
Even though they're very undervalued and animalistic and that they would probably destroy all the white.

[02:42:51.660 --> 02:42:53.460]
No education is a big key here.

[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:54.900]
I understand your point.

[02:42:55.600 --> 02:43:02.260]
But you cannot, especially now, they cannot ignore the minority when there is such a world focus on them at this point in time.

[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:07.840]
I just really feel that, you know, just like it's been said many times

[02:43:07.840 --> 02:43:13.260]
that when you have a small group of people that are in power and you have a large group that aren't,

[02:43:13.360 --> 02:43:19.860]
you have to make some concessions but if they're not ready mentally or in any other way or they're going to be violent.

[02:43:19.940 --> 02:43:21.800]
Well, I haven't heard this in George Walton.

[02:43:21.860 --> 02:43:25.760]
It sounds like you think that they're doing it for the good of the blacks out Africans.

[02:43:26.380 --> 02:43:27.280]
So they're suppressed.

[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:28.380]
Are you going to keep them suppressed?

[02:43:28.620 --> 02:43:29.360]
I mean that's ridiculous.

[02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:31.360]
I'm not going to be a press secretary.

[02:43:31.420 --> 02:43:32.560]
You're educated and roll up.

[02:43:32.580 --> 02:43:35.640]
You need to educate people over the world.

[02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:37.440]
How can they govern a country without education?

[02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:39.380]
I don't know the situation over there.

[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:40.820]
He doesn't like me, he hung up.

[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:44.040]
Well, we don't like you either but we won't hang up on you.

[02:43:44.100 --> 02:43:44.740]
I like to stand.

[02:43:44.860 --> 02:43:47.120]
I've never mentioned having formed that opinion yet.

[02:43:47.420 --> 02:43:51.080]
Well, he's got an interesting point there and you're going to give him credit again.

[02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:52.720]
He's got the right to voice his opinion.

[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:59.400]
But the government there is not, they don't have the policy of apartheid for the good of the people because they're not ready.

[02:43:59.780 --> 02:44:00.560]
Doesn't that sound nice?

[02:44:00.780 --> 02:44:04.360]
You know, I'm not going to make you move out into your own apartment, Randy, until you're ready.

[02:44:04.940 --> 02:44:05.400]
Well, geez.

[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:09.920]
We're not going to point you to the council until you're a better educated.

[02:44:10.100 --> 02:44:10.900]
That's right.

[02:44:11.140 --> 02:44:13.840]
It's definitely for selfish, cruel reasons.

[02:44:13.940 --> 02:44:18.340]
They have treated the blacks so de-plorably in South Africa.

[02:44:18.820 --> 02:44:21.520]
But now it has to change and the question is how.

[02:44:22.220 --> 02:44:24.280]
How do they change it without more bloodshed?

[02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:27.660]
I mean Nelson Mandela is not a nonviolent man.

[02:44:27.860 --> 02:44:30.060]
How do they change it without really wanting to?

[02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:32.280]
They don't want to at all but they have to.

[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:39.280]
So they better start getting used to the idea because the world is changing in the past year with the Berlin Wall checkpoint.

[02:44:40.100 --> 02:44:40.920]
Charlie, things are happening.

[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:42.400]
What do you think they're good at about the world's change?

[02:44:42.400 --> 02:44:42.540]
Exactly right.

[02:44:42.900 --> 02:44:44.720]
And again, world's focus is on them.

[02:44:44.860 --> 02:44:45.280]
So what do you do?

[02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:47.620]
I have no idea how to change it.

[02:44:47.720 --> 02:44:48.280]
Because I'm not bothered.

[02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:50.480]
We just talk about the value of the idea.

[02:44:50.980 --> 02:44:52.180]
But something has to be done here.

[02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:53.820]
Let's take another call from Miami.

[02:44:54.160 --> 02:44:55.360]
Good afternoon folks. How are you?

[02:44:55.520 --> 02:44:56.200]
Fine, how are you?

[02:44:56.460 --> 02:44:56.620]
Good.

[02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:00.180]
I'm still trying to get over the mental picture of your talk, Samir naked.

[02:45:00.180 --> 02:45:00.440]
You can't get this.

[02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:02.240]
Oh my god.

[02:45:04.260 --> 02:45:05.540]
What's your way through it?

[02:45:05.640 --> 02:45:07.040]
So what's your way through it?

[02:45:08.060 --> 02:45:09.700]
I'm better than golden my ear next.

[02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:12.500]
Oh god.

[02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:19.260]
I'm constantly amazed and baffled by how an informed people are.

[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:26.800]
Nelson Mandela and the ANC have always professed to be of socialist leadings for lack of a better world.

[02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:29.900]
I don't like to put terms on anybody calming the socialists, whatever.

[02:45:30.620 --> 02:45:35.560]
I've always advocated the overthrow of the government in Pretoria by force if necessary.

[02:45:37.040 --> 02:45:40.220]
Mandela, when he was released, made speeches that effect.

[02:45:41.620 --> 02:45:43.140]
Why then the reaction?

[02:45:43.580 --> 02:45:44.020]
Why then the...

[02:45:44.020 --> 02:45:47.040]
Because people, it's politically correct to feel that way now.

[02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:54.400]
See this whole thing by the politicians, by these local mayors and other politicians who are up in arms about this, elections are coming up in November.

[02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:56.600]
These people are seizing on an issue that's going to be applied for.

[02:45:56.600 --> 02:45:58.400]
I think the public wants them to react to this.

[02:45:58.400 --> 02:45:59.600]
Of course, of course they don't kill.

[02:45:59.940 --> 02:46:04.120]
Morals have never stood in the way of getting people's votes in this country, especially.

[02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:07.460]
And I agree with Stan 100 percent on that.

[02:46:07.580 --> 02:46:10.880]
I mean these guys will do anything and they will sell anybody out for a vote.

[02:46:11.320 --> 02:46:15.540]
Our country has wanked civil rights abuses around the world forever.

[02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:23.040]
And whenever it was in their best interest, what are it be it politically or monetarily to do so?

[02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:24.560]
But let me ask you a question.

[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:30.320]
If he had not stuck his foot in his mouth and made this statement about the PLO, FITO, Castro, etc.

[02:46:32.260 --> 02:46:36.000]
Would we still be hearing the kind of calls we're getting?

[02:46:36.260 --> 02:46:39.560]
Would there still be the concern about the violence?

[02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:40.620]
Probably not.

[02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:41.780]
No, not at all.

[02:46:42.220 --> 02:46:42.660]
Probably not.

[02:46:42.700 --> 02:46:43.180]
Probably not.

[02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:44.580]
For people...

[02:46:44.580 --> 02:46:48.620]
And also these politicians would have missed a good opportunity to see something without an on issue.

[02:46:48.620 --> 02:46:53.220]
And then you have all these people who are professing such great concern, perhaps the demagogues or what have you.

[02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:54.280]
I may be using that word incorrectly.

[02:46:54.780 --> 02:46:58.400]
You have all the people who are all of a sudden concerned now that Mandela is coming to Miami.

[02:46:58.540 --> 02:46:59.940]
Maki Mandela was here several months ago.

[02:47:00.020 --> 02:47:01.140]
I went to see her at Miami, did North.

[02:47:01.620 --> 02:47:02.840]
How many of these callers did?

[02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:07.820]
How many people are concerned enough about what's going on in the world that they have an opportunity to see?

[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:11.900]
The daughter of a major leader who lived there knows what's going on, his experience that herself.

[02:47:12.460 --> 02:47:14.360]
To see her, I would say why she's there.

[02:47:14.360 --> 02:47:14.620]
Why should I understand?

[02:47:14.700 --> 02:47:15.560]
A lot of people don't vote.

[02:47:15.980 --> 02:47:16.480]
Oh, absolutely.

[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:20.480]
People in politicians in particular are concerned with their own agendas and really have...

[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:23.460]
So you think Suarez would have showed up to bask in the limelight?

[02:47:23.500 --> 02:47:23.900]
Oh, absolutely.

[02:47:24.340 --> 02:47:25.400]
Had it been politically correct.

[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:26.780]
He had not added to Del Castro.

[02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:31.400]
Had it been politically correct to do so, he would have been right there with bells and keys and...

[02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:33.820]
And the key has not been molded.

[02:47:33.940 --> 02:47:36.120]
Every other thing that he could get is grubby little paws on.

[02:47:36.460 --> 02:47:42.020]
Whatever it's going to take to get his constituency out to the voting booths.

[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:44.520]
That's really where the bottom line lies.

[02:47:45.740 --> 02:47:54.980]
Wouldn't it be interesting to find out whether our new Hispanic Congresswoman attended the speech this morning?

[02:47:55.340 --> 02:47:56.500]
I'm sure she did.

[02:47:56.600 --> 02:47:57.460]
Oh boy.

[02:47:57.600 --> 02:48:00.060]
I assume you folks read Robert Steinbeck's column in the hairless.

[02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:00.580]
Fabulous.

[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:01.360]
I brought it with me.

[02:48:01.380 --> 02:48:02.620]
Thank you guys for coming.

[02:48:03.060 --> 02:48:06.640]
There's some other good things in the viewpoint section about this whole business.

[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:06.880]
I know.

[02:48:07.600 --> 02:48:08.120]
Okay, great.

[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.920]
We'll have to see tomorrow if she did or not attend.

[02:48:12.300 --> 02:48:13.940]
A lot of people boy-cotted that.

[02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:16.760]
A lot of politicians did boy-cut that.

[02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:17.680]
And they were vocal.

[02:48:17.860 --> 02:48:19.520]
In fact, I can't remember.

[02:48:19.860 --> 02:48:20.280]
I can't hear her.

[02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:23.820]
Donner, somebody from California was the one who ever used to think of him.

[02:48:23.820 --> 02:48:23.820]

[02:48:24.060 --> 02:48:26.480]
Didn't hear any voice bit on her.

[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:27.440]
But he was an idiot.

[02:48:27.900 --> 02:48:29.080]
See, there's so many minutes.

[02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:30.540]
No, there's so many members.

[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:31.840]
This is a great thing.

[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:37.000]
I used to, when I was in Germany and in the army, we still used to read Eomasco because it had good music.

[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:46.280]
And I was always amazed that they were able to take voice cuts out of United States Congress people who were serving.

[02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:54.940]
And use it to their particular, to make a point with regard to Russia, with their politics.

[02:48:55.640 --> 02:49:00.580]
And I had a discussion with that about a couple of friends and they were smarter than I was at the time.

[02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:03.640]
They said, look, there's 400 and some members.

[02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:07.580]
And out of them, you're going to get all kinds of people.

[02:49:08.220 --> 02:49:16.320]
So this guy that they used the sound bites on yesterday who was saying that it was, you know, he was using very strong language.

[02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:20.720]
You know, okay, you're not going to attend the speech.

[02:49:20.780 --> 02:49:24.360]
You don't think Mandela should have been given the invitation of the first place fine.

[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:28.940]
You catch the language a little diplomatically and you come out smelling my caros.

[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:30.640]
This guy comes out smelling like an idiot.

[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:33.380]
You know, hot 105 is broadcasting the speech live.

[02:49:33.540 --> 02:49:34.240]
That's incredible.

[02:49:34.580 --> 02:49:35.780]
That's the pretty bold stuff.

[02:49:36.060 --> 02:49:37.400]
Did I usually make that decision?

[02:49:37.980 --> 02:49:38.640]
He was part of it.

[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:42.000]
I don't know actually who made the decision, but certainly, you know, Keith is our program director.

[02:49:42.020 --> 02:49:44.000]
I'm really amazed that they're going to do that.

[02:49:44.220 --> 02:49:47.040]
We know that the TV stations will be broadcasting his whole visit.

[02:49:47.900 --> 02:49:49.420]
So forget your soap operatives.

[02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:50.480]
And the protests outside.

[02:49:51.040 --> 02:49:55.260]
It is absolutely a world event, whether you like it or you don't.

[02:49:55.340 --> 02:49:55.980]
And it's important.

[02:49:55.980 --> 02:50:00.160]
And if people want to be informed and want to know what's going on and want to know what he's going to say,

[02:50:00.860 --> 02:50:03.200]
then you listen to the speech or you go to it or you read it.

[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:04.700]
Well, you can't go to it. It's closed.

[02:50:04.840 --> 02:50:05.840]
Right. Right. You hear it.

[02:50:06.220 --> 02:50:07.860]
Again, we were talking before.

[02:50:08.080 --> 02:50:09.320]
Miami is the only leg of the trip.

[02:50:09.320 --> 02:50:10.580]
It's the shortest leg of the trip.

[02:50:11.140 --> 02:50:16.040]
And it's also the one where he is not reaching any people other than the ones in their convention.

[02:50:16.340 --> 02:50:19.420]
There is no open forum for him to address a crowd of people.

[02:50:19.840 --> 02:50:22.560]
And we had a couple of callers this morning that we're going to make it a point

[02:50:22.560 --> 02:50:27.540]
to see if they could catch a glimpse of him or where somehow be close to where he is.

[02:50:27.620 --> 02:50:29.780]
Well, there's this rally afterwards at Gwenshary Park.

[02:50:30.460 --> 02:50:34.940]
And I hadn't heard at the station before I left whether or not he was actually going to make it appear in Theranapica

[02:50:34.940 --> 02:50:36.240]
because it's got a very tight schedule, isn't that?

[02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:40.320]
But I think that's one of the only ways people can see him unless they seem coming in.

[02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:41.860]
I don't think he'll be there.

[02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:43.280]
I saw his schedule.

[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:51.940]
I was listed in the paper and he's making the speech and then like out to the airport and into Detroit tomorrow night.

[02:50:52.520 --> 02:50:57.480]
Is he actually he's over nighting at Atlanta and then he's coming down here and then boom right off.

[02:50:57.480 --> 02:50:58.080]
That's what I think.

[02:50:58.240 --> 02:51:03.760]
We're going to take a break here and we'll be back on Newstalk Radio 610 W I O D.

[02:51:04.200 --> 02:51:06.800]
Now you didn't need a donut this morning.

[02:51:07.460 --> 02:51:08.180]
No, I didn't.

[02:51:08.260 --> 02:51:09.020]
You realize that?

[02:51:09.600 --> 02:51:10.500]
Well, is there one left?

[02:51:10.560 --> 02:51:11.340]
Break self-restraint.

[02:51:11.480 --> 02:51:11.700]
Three.

[02:51:13.760 --> 02:51:15.080]
Well, then I'll eat all three.

[02:51:15.660 --> 02:51:17.640]
No, maybe not.

[02:51:17.720 --> 02:51:18.220]
Well, I'll pass.

[02:51:18.600 --> 02:51:20.440]
We're going to let it eat all three and knock it down.

[02:51:21.620 --> 02:51:22.960]
Donuts are the worst thing.

[02:51:23.140 --> 02:51:24.960]
Dance contributions of the show was that was donuts.

[02:51:25.200 --> 02:51:25.920]
They're so good.

[02:51:26.020 --> 02:51:28.100]
When you don't the morning shift, donuts are the worst possible.

[02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:30.620]
Donuts and coffees to kill me when I did morning shift.

[02:51:30.620 --> 02:51:31.440]
I can't take heartburns.

[02:51:32.380 --> 02:51:33.000]
I don't drink coffee.

[02:51:33.600 --> 02:51:34.120]
I can't drink coffee.

[02:51:35.200 --> 02:51:35.840]
I love donuts.

[02:51:36.060 --> 02:51:37.620]
I love everything that's bad for you.

[02:51:37.780 --> 02:51:39.660]
Just name it and I like it.

[02:51:40.220 --> 02:51:43.600]
It's almost we're almost closing up the one to two hour here.

[02:51:43.680 --> 02:51:45.640]
I'll take a couple of more calls and then we're history.

[02:51:46.280 --> 02:51:47.300]
Hey, Manny, I met you once.

[02:51:47.600 --> 02:51:47.920]
You did?

[02:51:48.220 --> 02:51:49.380]
Yeah, you've been old Lynn Friedman?

[02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:50.060]
Sure.

[02:51:50.460 --> 02:51:53.000]
Yeah, I met you over at where she works one time.

[02:51:53.080 --> 02:51:53.640]
Oh, okay.

[02:51:54.060 --> 02:51:56.400]
Annie, you sound just as good as you look.

[02:51:56.580 --> 02:51:57.620]
Oh, well, thank you, sir.

[02:51:58.100 --> 02:51:58.500]
Hey, Stan.

[02:51:58.920 --> 02:51:59.040]
What?

[02:51:59.480 --> 02:52:01.140]
Did he sound just as good as you look, sir?

[02:52:01.480 --> 02:52:03.320]
Hey, Stan, it's pretty hard for you to get a word in it.

[02:52:03.400 --> 02:52:05.160]
Why is there with those two Jewish ladies, right?

[02:52:05.300 --> 02:52:05.940]
That's fine.

[02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:06.220]
There are a few of them.

[02:52:06.220 --> 02:52:07.500]
We have such a bad reputation.

[02:52:07.820 --> 02:52:09.800]
Let's call it two live Jews.

[02:52:10.400 --> 02:52:11.320]
Oh, and hey.

[02:52:12.500 --> 02:52:12.500]

[02:52:12.560 --> 02:52:12.880]
Hey.

[02:52:13.260 --> 02:52:14.300]
Hey, no, just a little joke.

[02:52:15.440 --> 02:52:16.460]
Yeah, pretty little, sir.

[02:52:16.460 --> 02:52:20.240]
You know that guy that called in about the rockers and Mandela, and you cut him off?

[02:52:20.600 --> 02:52:23.480]
He was talking about Van Zand and that whole son city thing.

[02:52:23.560 --> 02:52:24.420]
Oh, okay.

[02:52:24.780 --> 02:52:26.960]
Well, I guess I have to play in all that drivel you play.

[02:52:27.080 --> 02:52:28.840]
You forgot about real rocker role, am I, Mendy?

[02:52:29.060 --> 02:52:30.680]
Well, well, we have to play in the car.

[02:52:31.440 --> 02:52:33.200]
At least he did it for light, Lou.

[02:52:33.460 --> 02:52:34.120]
He tried.

[02:52:34.420 --> 02:52:34.640]
He tried.

[02:52:35.740 --> 02:52:39.420]
And on that note, we've got Shane Thomas on the news coming up.

[02:52:39.640 --> 02:52:41.720]
We're going to say goodbye and see you again tomorrow.

[02:52:41.880 --> 02:52:44.880]
Don't forget tonight the Yankees versus the Brewer's at 735.

[02:52:44.880 --> 02:52:49.120]
And right after the news, Rick and Sud.

[02:52:49.740 --> 02:52:51.180]
A new stock radio 610-

[02:52:51.180 --> 02:52:52.500]
We're going to show you all that.
