down so let me add that to our total for Camilla's house because that's really we're here for two

[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.140]
reasons today and that is to bring a lot of people out to the bizarre and spend billions of dollars

[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.820]

[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:33.660]
43,533 now let me share a little secret with you okay this year we started our camelist house drive

[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:38.300]
earlier than we've ever done before we started November first so today is like 28 days four weeks

[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:43.780]
to the day that we started last year at this time last year we started like I think in the middle

[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:47.480]
of November of course last year we had a little bit of an impediment because somebody was on a

[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.920]
show didn't like to talk about all of this too much and also I went on vacation the end of November

[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:58.140]
so we got off to real slow start by the 10th of December last year we had a total a grand total

[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:06.700]
of about 3500 dollars I wound up with 76,000 I would go to the bank by January bus hey I got

[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.000]
news for if you go to the bank right now these people give you a standing ovation I just hang

[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.940]
on the bank because I think there's an AmeriForrest right off the side I was a few minutes late

[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:21.240]
yeah I had to make a check the catch of 300 dollars so I could buy these two t-shirts you get

[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:26.420]
to get the 300 bucks for the two t-shirts outstanding sell them a couple of more okay no that's why

[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:32.160]
what these shirts but as I was saying now you could go to the bank you're going to hit one

[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.960]
a hundred thousand dollars for Camellia's house by charter plus you could go to the bank on it

[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.780]
and now you know it's everybody and if we fall short you'll cover it right you bring your check

[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:46.420]
book no but you can go to the bank man as bizarre as he is you know he's the only man in South
