[00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:12.220]
Let's get right back to these because it's been one of my favorite days. It's North Miami Beach next. Hello. Hello. Yeah. Are you doing Neil? Okay. Hey, I'll grab you now. Uh, what's the temperature today? What was the temperature today?

[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:27.460]
Yeah. I just wanted to tell you I was listening to that station next door and I heard Alex's buddy pen on there. He's doing some sort of promo.

[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:41.000]
He said, uh, this is 10 of pen and color McBean you suck. Oh, that's great. Excellent. Creative right to the point. But didn't Alex pay him enough to be on his show. He had to run next door. I can't afford that yet.

[00:00:41.960 --> 00:01:10.940]
Well, listen, my best friend, uh, Penn July told me that it's all just a big joke. Right. Okay. All right. My good friend George Washington and Abe Lincoln and Benjamin Harrison. Have a great day. Hey, wait. Can I, uh, can I cross my a douchebag now? No chance. Uh, you have to have better material on that to call somebody a douchebag. Miami. Hello. Neil. Yeah. How you doing? Okay. Uh, the boys and I would like to invite you to one of our theme picnics. Good. We have two open lines. You're both in Dave County 751 W I O D.

[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:28.900]
Hello. Hello. Yeah. Deal. Yes. Yeah. I got a Gilbert Spire report for you. Yeah. Yeah. It was sitting out at Mark by staying with my, my own business. And here, cruising by the field level seats is Gilbert carrying the sign of Jack with Jackie Cleason's picture on it.

[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:58.860]
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, he was a horrible last night. He was very entertaining trying to pick up on all the co ads. Uh, huh. So when you, when you talk to him, I don't talk to him. Sir Gilbert is history on this show. Don't you understand that? I mean, he doesn't have what? You got that on the car. You don't have him laughing. It's all your dreaming. Okay. I'll go back to sleep. That. Okay. When you wake up, I hope you feel a lot better. Halondale. He only over the man. What does that mean? Canada? What does that mean?

[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:28.840]
Hello, Neil. Yeah. How are you today? Where are you in Hamilton? No, Ottawa. Ottawa. Ottawa. No one likes to devil down here. What a good connection. I'm down here. Right? Yeah. Uh huh. How are you today? Great. I just, I just came up from being down there five months. And I missed you. You came up from being down there. So did you ever consider maybe taking like, you get a compass would be a good, then take a geography course? Well, um, you just came up from down there. I just came up to go up to Australia. My

[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.920]
self. No, no. I mean, I just came up from Florida to up here. What? You're in, you expect me to believe

[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.380]
you're in Canada now? I'm in Canada right now with a connection like this. Yeah. We should get a car from

[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.940]
Channel seven and it wouldn't sound this clear. Okay. No, it's probably be a wrong number. What? I'm in Ottawa. No,

[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.100]
you're not. I am. Yeah. I'll prove it to you. How can you prove it to me? Stick it out the window.

[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.320]
The phone. It's too cold out here. The phone. Yeah, I know. It's, it's terrible. Okay. If you say so,

[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.460]
well, humor, you know, how come you didn't call collect? Uh, so I didn't need to. Oh, you're loaded,

[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.680]
huh? No, I meant work. Oh, you're using somebody else's money. Of course. Great. What's the area code

[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.580]
there? 613. 613. I'll be dang. Well, that's great. Yeah. Can I, can I listen for a little

[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.160]
while? It's a foster. You would say to say hi to you too, by the way. The foster, you at the,

[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.500]
they declared Harold, Harold, Ballard in competence yesterday. I said foster. You would said to say,

[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.060]
didn't we already know about that? Okay. Harold Ballard's been incompetent for the last 50 years.

[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.800]
This morning's paper had a collection of quotes from him over the years on various subjects.

[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.440]
They were quite entertaining. Yeah. You know what the first one was?

[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.040]
No, what was it? I'm dying on the air. Hold on, sir. Now you good luck to you. Okay. I can't

[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.680]
believe that. Do you believe he's an Ottawa? I guess so if he says so, who the hell are we to

[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.680]
argue? Mobile on the turnpike that's got to be gone by now, right? No, I'm here. Well, fantastic.

[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.860]
How are you doing? How are you doing, Neil? Well, I'm not sure. I think we're making a slow come back here.

[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.820]
I hope so. Hey, you mentioned Conno Mizzillo the other day on the, on the radio and he's from

[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.940]
Canis, still in New York. One of those small handles up there in upstate New York.

[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.640]
Wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let's slow down. I mentioned Kalamazoo and he's from Canis,

[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.400]
Stoda. The common Bizzillo. The common Bizzillo. Yeah. Not Bizzillo. Bizzillo.

[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.300]
Bizzillo with a cauliflower here. Yeah. Yeah, right. And just wanted to say hi. I listen to your call all

[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.580]
the time. Is he, isn't he dead? No, no. He's, he's, he's, but he's not dead. Oh, close. Yeah, close.

[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.940]
Okay. But I just wanted to say hi to another upstate New Yorker. Great. Also, one is called

[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.480]
a white PC, a douchebag. Excellent job, sir. Very good. Have a good one. You too. Now there's a call.

[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.580]
29 after one at W. I. O. D. We have an opening in date County, but you're going to have to move like

[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:54.200]
the wind to get in. That's obvious. 751 W. I. O. D. Let's go to, um, oh, come on. I don't want it.

[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.500]
I don't want to do over and under and in and out. Get out of here with that chip to sure. Don't

[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.240]
ever put those on. Those are the most awful calls and you can't understand them and they're,

[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.100]
okay, over. Just try to impress somebody. Okay. I'm not interested in talking anybody on a ship.

[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.620]
North Miami Beach. Hello, unless they want to pick me on it and get out of here real quick. Yes.

[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.800]
Yeah. Who's this playing? Wait a minute, sir. Just slow down a minute. Yes.

[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.740]
Listen, I heard that W. N. I. I'm going to take over W. I. Yeah, right.

[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:32.140]
You have you heard that? Yeah. Just now. A Fort Lauderdale. Hello. A high net. Yeah, what do you want, Bill?

[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.620]
Pardon me? My name's Tom. I just moved down here and I really enjoy your show. Great, Jack.

[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.500]
Tom. I told the guy that I answered. We don't hear what your name is. Sir, everybody's anonymous

[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.380]
on this show. Even the host. Do you do issues? Yeah. What do you want to talk about?

[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.340]
Oh, well, you know, let's talk about the reunification of Germany. Okay, sir. Let's play

[00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.860]
Duitsland, New Boralus. The drug problem. Oh, yeah. Let's solve the drug problem. Let's get

[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.240]
in that real heavy duty, man. We've got the war on drug. How about income tax?

[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.640]
Income tax would be excellent. Okay. Let's have the the tea bag rebellion.

[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.720]
Well, man, I really like I like the show. Excellent. Okay. Far. Jack, we'll talk to you.

[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:25.840]
130 is W. I. D. We have an opening in Broward. 5249463 W. I. D. Nails. Yeah. What's up? What do you want?

[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.840]
Just to call up. See what's going on. Okay. Let's go to Boca. Hello. I want to get back.

[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:40.100]
Palm Beach. Hello. Oh, Nail. Yeah. How you doing? Okay. Now this town really depresses me. Yes. Every day.

[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.940]
And I was I was thinking if you want any special reason or just in general. Just in general.

[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.840]
But if you really want to corner the market, if you want every share. I don't want to corner the

[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.940]
market. I want out of the market. Sure. Like by two o'clock. I want out. I was thinking you should do

[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.000]
your show by Langually to a Spanish show and an English show. Right. That's just what we need.

[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.660]
Another Spanish language station. Sure. Don't you realize? Did you have any you heard that this? What

[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.880]
do they call it? All a simulation. That's what's going to happen. Everybody's going to be

[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.580]
assimilated and in no time at all all the Spanish language stations will be gone. That's why we

[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.620]
have 47 of them now. But think of it. Neil, Neil and Espanya. That would be incredible. That would

[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.280]
be absolutely incredible. El Paso, Sir, audio. It's have a wonderful life. Let's go to

[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:31.860]
Palm Beach. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah. May I hold to listen to the show? No. W-I-O-D. Yeah, how you doing?

[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.640]
Okay. Good. I know this comes in the shock. But the lines are first used to talk to people.

[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.840]
Not for people to use like as a radio. Go out and buy a radio. Okay. Cheapskate. We're using the

[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.360]
radio. The guy in Palm Beach that I just hung up on. Well, damn him. Exactly. Hello. She think

[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.980]
this is. Who the hell does he want? I don't know what the hell anyone in this town wants. I am so

[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:58.580]
mad. I am ready to spew some venom on your radio. Good. Go ahead, sir. Do it. Oakland Park,

[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:05.020]
you people in the mail department are a bunch of screw ups. They suck. They're afraid of little

[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:10.480]
barking dogs. Yes. They've got to walk all the way up to the house to the mailbox. Well, we don't

[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.620]
want to deliver mail to your neighbors because your dog barks. I hope they're listening. I hope

[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:19.120]
they're listening because I hope they dial wicked deaths. You're a painful wicked death. I'm

[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:26.420]
going to make sure they do. God, I did it. I'm going to cover that whole place in one great big bag

[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:31.800]
that I'm going to pump every poison known to man into it. I can hear me. Yeah, I can hear you.

[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.100]
Not really. I hope they hear me. I know. I'm a little upset. I'm sorry. I got to calm down.

[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:41.100]
Gonna be okay now. Yeah. I feel better. You feel better? Yeah. Yeah. I don't order lunch now.

[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.480]
Excellent. Okay. I'm not going to say anything. Have it. I say, well, I almost said something

[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:50.560]
terrible right there. It would have been true, but it would have been terrible. 133. You know what it was.

[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:58.300]
Oh, God. It would have been it would have been curtains, but I would love to say it. W-I-O-D.

[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.760]
This is the real Irene Richard.

[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:12.180]
You that was excellent. Wasn't it? I read the Queen W-I-O-D. Hello. Excuse me. Has anyone

[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:18.380]
I just barely missed your number? If I tell you a number, would you tell me whether that's

[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:23.980]
or not? No. So I'm 33 at W-I-O-D. I'll give you a number. Okay.

[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.380]
Should we take a little break here? I think we ought to probably take a little break and

[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.220]
is that her again? W-I-O-D. This is Irene Richard. Oh, hold on Irene. That sounds

[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:40.580]
more like the real one. Anyway, don't call me for numbers. Okay. Don't call me for numbers. I don't

[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.680]
know any numbers. I know the phone numbers and I know the numbers are in the clock, which means

[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.420]
that in about 25 minutes I'm getting the hell out of here. Okay. And I'm going to go home and take

[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:54.180]
a crock's animal and I'm going to feel a lot better when I get through. It's 134 at W-I-O-D.

[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.920]
911 is the oursgs here.

[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:39.320]
Come, come, baby, I can say for you, for you, for you, take it all for me

[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.560]
All I do is breathe, I can't decide

[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.940]
Come, I don't know how to say

[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:03.220]
I can't believe that people tell me

[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:11.640]
My head is all made of the name of me

[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:16.800]
I can't believe that people tell me

[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:22.760]
I can't believe that people tell me

[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:39.720]
I can't believe that people tell me

[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.760]
I can't believe that people tell me

[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:45.760]
I can't believe that people tell me

[00:11:52.760 --> 00:12:00.280]
I can't believe that people tell me

[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.200]
Driving home the music, driving home the news

[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.400]
Driving home the sports and weather

[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.600]
All the different views

[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.400]
He'll help you through the traffic

[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.440]
Care it's mild or too

[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.300]
Stop the car, those driving home with you every day

[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.300]
Stop the car, those driving home

[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.400]
My stomach plays specials double gear

[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.700]
I-O-D

[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.240]
Okay, 1-40, it's someplace embarrassing W-I-O-D

[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.280]
Pembroke Pines

[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.220]
He said, oh this is the guy that we left because he was still mumbling before

[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.460]
Are you mumbling, sir?

[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.500]
He's still mumbling, okay, he's still busy in the background

[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.360]
Miami

[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.640]
I'm holding a foot stand

[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.300]
Okay, south-seach

[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.600]
Hey, how you doing today?

[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.280]
Okay

[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.920]
I was gonna ask you, what did you used to work at before working at a talk show?

[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:57.280]
Oh

[00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.220]
At Denny's

[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.180]
At Denny's?

[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:00.340]
Yeah

[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.160]
Oh man, what's Denny's at?

[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.540]
On the buscane in 30 years six

[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.860]
Oh, it's the buscane 30 years?

[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:06.640]
Are you married?

[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.200]
No

[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.240]
Are you?

[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.160]
I'm on the bus

[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.440]
So you want to go out?

[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.840]
Yeah, do you want to go out?

[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.380]
Okay

[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.160]
Let's go to, oh, you're just listening?

[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:17.900]
Yeah

Get off the phone

[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.840]
What did you put him on a hold for, Melvin?

[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.340]
I put him on a hold no chance

[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.700]
Let's go to Dearfield, hello

[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.220]
Hello

[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:26.980]
How you doing?

[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:27.520]
Okay

[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.280]
What's up?

[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.580]
I got something for you here, Neil

[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:29.980]
I bet

[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.340]
Put it in a bag

[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.860]
Okay, this is gonna be good now

[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.900]
And you can go home for the rest of the day

[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.900]
Put it in a sack for the four forever

[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:37.320]

It's not working

How the hell did you get on there?

[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.560]

Well, I'm going to tell you something

When I get off of here I'm going to take a sash cord

[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.400]
And rip it around Nick's neck

[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.960]
Wrangle him to a beat him to a pulp with a 2x4

And then go into Boy Gary and do the same

[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.520]
Just repeat it

[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.960]

Okay?
