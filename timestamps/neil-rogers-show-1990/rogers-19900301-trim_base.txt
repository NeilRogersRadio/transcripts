[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:06.300]
WIOD

[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.380]
WIOD

[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.320]
Nell

[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.940]
Yes sir.

[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.320]
Have you seen the billboard of Luis Miguel on the palm metal?

[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.460]
I heard it's really ugly.

[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.920]
It's not the billboard.

[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.880]
He's got a big billboard on it.

[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.500]
I know but I heard it's really grotesque.

[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.460]
He's got a looking down.

[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.500]
Not very good.

[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.820]
Yeah.

[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.200]
Just want to know if he caught that.

[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.420]
No.

[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.740]
I haven't seen it yet but I'm going to drive.

[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.920]
I'm going to do a drive by right after the show.

[00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.200]
Did you get his new CD?

[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.100]
Yes I have.

[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.660]
It's so scary.

[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.980]
I'm going to do a drive by right after the show.

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.980]

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.980]

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.980]

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.980]

[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.500]
First off Florida's news.

[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.320]
Talk and entertainment station.

[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.560]
New.

[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.540]
In drivers and voters.

[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.960]
Speak of the devil.

[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.200]
From 10 p.m. tonight till 3 a.m. on Saturday.

[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.240]
Drivers and voters will be stopped in various tech points by police offices.

[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.420]
The Florida Marine Patrol and U.S. Coast Guard.

[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.340]
The Broward Sheriff's Office.

[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.100]
Tech points will be in the 1000 block of South Federal Highway and Deerfield Beach.

[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.480]
In the 2400 block of North Federal Highway near Papad, O'Veats.

[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.600]
In the 33 to 3400 blocks of West Commercial Boulevard in Tamarack.

[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.940]
Get rid of it.

[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.100]
I'm getting like goose bumps just here in that car.

[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.800]
It sucks.

[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.480]
It bites.

[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.800]
Cooper City.

[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.100]
Hello.

[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.440]
How you doing?

[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.380]
Our question.

[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.180]
Yes sir.

[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.060]
Beaver fever.

[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.420]
Beaver fever.

[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.520]
Great choice.

[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.660]
Outstanding selection.

[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.480]
You know what else?

[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.340]
Nice and long too.

[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.920]
Yeah, no.

[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.840]
And the car too.

[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.820]
Thanks again.

[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.180]
Okay. Have a great weekend.

[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.040]
See you.

[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.660]
Marlon's rule.

[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.040]
I should mention again about our Marlon Contest.

[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.420]
Should not.

[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.860]
Should really.

[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.120]
Are we getting any postcards today?

[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.340]
Yeah.

[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.420]
We better be.

[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.600]
We better be getting floated.

[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.900]
We better be getting inundated with boxes and boxes of postcards.

[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.220]
Otherwise, they were in big trouble.

[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.780]
Marlon's season tickets were given away one pair of Marlon season tickets for our inaugural 1993 baseball season.

[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:05.980]
And you don't have to answer any stupid questions or put on a silly wig or come and drag or come here or a stark naked with a little tiny bikini jock strap on although it has its possibilities.

[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.520]
Anyway, one entry per person just sent a postcard.

[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:22.860]
With your name, address phone number, shoe size and a bra size to Marlon tickets WIOD Miami 33141 postcards must be postmarked no later than Wednesday April 1st, no fooling.

[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.720]
Or you can bring them by our studios here before 5 p.m. April 3rd.

[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.540]
And then we'll draw the winner Monday April 6th on his show and that's it.

[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.160]
And somebody's going to win a pair of season tickets for the Marlon season hopefully far away from our minor going to be.

[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.540]
10 after 11 here's a big report in Miami.

[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.660]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.040]
There's porkers on bikes along with 5.0 over the overpass of the Palmetto and 836.

[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.800]
I'll be damned.

[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.820]
They're facing a westbound.

[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.760]
They're catching everybody.

[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.600]
They're point always on the east side but that way the westbounders can't see them.

[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.000]
A little subtifuses what you're saying there is sir.

[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.480]
Another one of their little games they're playing with us.

[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.660]
Games, people play.

[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.560]
Yeah, they play in the little games they have lined up with about 7 motorcycles there catching everybody.

[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.080]
Jeez.

[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.940]
So watch out.

[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.380]
Thanks for the alert pal.

[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.420]
Have a great day.

[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.720]
And speaking of that, what timing man I got news for you.

[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.040]
Even if it's only by accident the timing on the show is so swell.

[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.740]
The ticket defense team would like to help you fight back against those very self-same porkers that this wonderful caller was just alerting you to.

[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.800]
Don't go to a traffic school and you know just waste your time.

[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.080]
We've told you all about that.

[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:43.040]
Don't go ahead and pay the ticket and take the least course at least resistance because you're going to wind up with more points on your record before you know what you're going to be driving around with suspended a license man.

[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.400]
Suspended a sentence.

[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.200]
You're going to go have to see Marlon Brando and I got news for you.

[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.560]
He's so big now nobody can even get in the door at his house.

[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.380]
So instead call the ticket defense team for just 99 bucks.

[00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.060]
They'll go to court for you and they'll defend you on all non criminal traffic tickets and accident cases even DUI.

[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:08.340]
You'll have an attorney there to go to bat for you and he has a better batting average than Johnny Mies and Smoky Burgers put together the ticket defense team.

[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:16.460]
And let me remind you again if you remember of AAA in my costume nothing or pretty close to it because they will reimburse their members 50 to 100 bucks toward traffic ticket attorneys fees.

[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.340]
It really pays to fight back with the ticket defense team and they do a great job for you.

[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.020]
Call Randy Maltosh, toll free from any place.

[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.220]
1-800-741-Team.

[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.740]
1-800-741-8326.

[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.940]
If you're in date County call Randy at 3-717-377-8326.

[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.520]
Strike back against evil up porkers with the ticket defense team.

[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.780]
It's love and 14 and Andy Cald from our newsroom just made a startling announcement to it.

[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.600]
Oh, it's not bad enough that we have Orlando's picture and he advocate but other people in the newsroom are actually checking it out.

[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.820]
Anyway, Andy brings me one of these, what do they call these things? Don't they have a name for these things?

[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.140]
The years ago they used to have these little things and you'd look these little plastic things and it would be a picture.

[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.300]
A magic scope.

[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.320]
A magic scope? No, that's what you'd mouthwash.

[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:16.460]
Looks like this guy in here could use a little magic scope but it's a surfer guy and he's not blonde which of course blows it all to hell anyway.

[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.680]
And it's some promotion for where do you say up in Kissimmee they're doing a water flume thing?

[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.960]
This guy looks a little bit too old like about 90. Now he's okay, it's a good guy.

[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.080]
Andy's got his name in the dress I guess.

[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:44.300]
A show was born in the 50s about a family so white.

[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:51.480]
The reruns will last forever so you can watch the show every night.

[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.100]
Leave it to Bieber.

[00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.300]
In the morning, Bieber every day of the week.

[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.920]
Bieber.

[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.540]
Hey, Wally, how come your little brothers are geek?

[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:18.580]
The Lord does squat for a living but you wear pearls every day.

[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:27.540]
And when they want to make a movie, guess who gets in the way, leave it to Bieber.

[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.320]
In the bedroom and Bieber all through the place.

[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.400]
Bieber.

[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.140]
Gosh, Lumpy, the Bieber's always in your face.

[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.700]
Now we can't stand at the Haskell.

[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.080]
He's always telling those lies.

[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.080]
When he answers the kitchen, he says Mrs. Cleaver,

[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.940]
she looked nice, leave it to Bieber.

[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.540]
On the cable, Bieber on the UHF.

[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.680]
Bieber.

[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.900]
You can't avoid it.

[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.360]
Bieber's like taxes and death.

[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.100]
It's always Bieber.

[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.420]
In the morning, Bieber all through the night.

[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.980]
Let's shoot the Bieber.

[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.060]
So I guess for Andy's next birthday, we can get him a subscription to Playgirl.

[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.980]
It's 1117 at WIOD.

[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.100]
Well, it's always nice to know what to get people on their birthday.

[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.880]
You never know what it is.

[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.080]
They're looking for what they need.

[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.240]
And the literature of the poop that he brought in here on this water mania,

[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.400]
Catch a wave in Kassimi, Highway 192.

[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.120]
Open.

[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.560]
When is this open?

[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.120]
January through November.

[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.860]
Is it open now?

[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.260]
Why do we do a remote up there?

[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.680]
And the poop sheet on this says,

[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.640]
Hey dudes, all you moon doggies cruising the beaches for that awesome, perfect wave.

[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.040]
I thought it was going to be something else.

[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.000]
Just like the dedicated surfers in that classic surf epic endless summer,

[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.720]
We've all sure seen that many times.

[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.240]
Have it away.

[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:06.680]
You bet.

[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.000]
Check this out.

[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:15.700]
Surfs up in Central Florida with a new ride that slams you with an adrenaline pumping 35,000 gallons of water a minute

[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.880]
as in pump this, allowing for some awesome hardcore ugling.

[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:22.580]
Oggling.

[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.820]
It's OGG LING.

[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.380]
I was more thinking about ugling.

[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.180]
It's a surfers dream and a wipe out.

[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.500]
Central Florida is only the second place in the world to have it.

[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.620]
Tom Lachfield, the surfer invented this thing,

[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.960]
Desired it, a copy nature with a continuous wave form.

[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:44.260]
The ideal user friendly surf haven will be demonstrated at water mania Thursday, March 26th.

[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.640]
That's a week from yesterday next Thursday at 11 a.m.

[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.640]
In Kassimi, 60, 73 West Highway 192.

[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.040]
So go up there and check out all the surfer dudes and let's find out what it looks like.

[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:54.280]
Okay?

[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.380]
Andy wants to know too.

[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.340]
11 19 at WIOD, Dania.

[00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.160]
Hello, Neil.

[00:08:59.460 --> 00:08:59.620]
Yeah.

[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.000]
I got a request for you today.

[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.700]
I bet you do.

[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.640]
Boy, there's just no preliminary, no four play today, Maul.

[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.220]
I'll tell you the afterward.

[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.960]
That cart with Tammy Fay, with Jimmy Goes to Prisoner, whatever.

[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.420]
Yeah, keep your pants on, Jimmy.

[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.080]
That's the one.

[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:12.560]
No.

[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.620]
I was driving down.

[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.460]
I thought you said you were going to tell me afterward.

[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.940]
Well, this is afterwards.

[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:17.460]
Oh, okay.

[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:23.260]
I was driving down US one in Dania and I was a big truck and it was written on the back of it, the Supreme Meat Company.

[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.760]
And right underneath it was a sticker that said, unbelievable, Neil Wright.

[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.080]
Oh!

[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:27.560]
Yeah.

[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.180]
Well, they know they're meat over there.

[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:29.740]
I'll tell you that.

[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.120]
Have a good day, Neil.

[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.400]
Have a great life.

[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:33.200]
Bye-bye.

[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.260]
Hello, Jimmy.

[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.020]
This is Tammy Fay.

[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.400]
And here's a little song I wrote.

[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.280]
Just for you.

[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:53.740]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.940]
Jimmy's gone to prison.

[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.200]
They've locked him away.

[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:05.740]
And for the next ten years, that is where he'll stay.

[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:12.820]
There's lots of sweaty men there with nothing much to do.

[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.500]
Now, if you'll listen, Jimmy.

[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.840]
Here's some advice for you.

[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.060]
Keep your pants on, Jimmy.

[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.580]
Keep your pants on, Jimmy.

[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.280]
And don't kneel down to pray.

[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.940]
Don't kneel down to pray.

[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.840]
And don't you care, Finn, Dover.

[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.240]
You care, Finn, Dover.

[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.840]
No matter what they say.

[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.380]
No matter what they say.

[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.600]
Keep your pants on, Jimmy.

[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.460]
Or you can bet your life.

[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.860]
A big man named Baba will make you his wife.

[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.180]
You used to buy me diamonds.

[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.440]
You used to buy me pearls.

[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.100]
I'm giving you some baths out.

[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.080]
Should they say his or hers?

[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.320]
And when you take a shower, don't pick the soap up, honey.

[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.680]
Or you'll receive a donation.

[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.900]
But it won't be money.

[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.080]
Keep your pants on, Jimmy.

[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.680]
Keep your pants on, Jimmy.

[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.440]
Better run and hire.

[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.780]
Cause jail is Tony Island.

[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.840]
And you're a brand new bride.

[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.980]
Keep your pants on, Jimmy.

[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.220]
And stay inside yourself.

[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:36.900]
Because these lifestyle partners are from the BBL.

[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.980]
Squad breasts.

[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.120]
Keep your pants on, Jimmy.

[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.720]
Keep your pants on, Jimmy.

[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.420]
And don't kneel down to pray.

[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.980]
Don't kneel down to pray.

[00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.760]
And don't you dare bend over.

[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.960]
No matter what they say.

[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:09.600]
But if you'd like to trade places, just call old Tammy Faye.

[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:12.380]
Thank you.

[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:13.480]
Okay, 11.22.

[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.580]
I just found a cart that I don't know what it is.

[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.060]
How do you like that?

[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.460]
Not the American Top 40 with KCDC?

[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.460]
Well, we better check that out like after this.

[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.500]
For the next.

[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.840]
Not getting Andy Calvo subscription to Playgirl.

[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.000]
And little housey and brings the mail in here.

[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.520]
And the midst of a bunch of other crap.

[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:35.120]
Here is an issue of Playgirl.

[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.840]
With the most grotesque guy I've seen in years

[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.200]
who happens to be the centerfold and somebody should be shot.

[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.280]
Oh, God.

[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.540]
Man, gross ugly.

[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.360]
Cheers.

[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.800]
Okay, 29 after 11 at WIOD.

[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.000]
Do we have an open line on the Star Line?

[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.540]
Star IOD for Lauderdale.

[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.080]
Neil.

[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:56.680]
Yeah.

[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:57.440]
How you doing today?

[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:57.800]
Okay.

[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.780]
I got a request here for you.

[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.160]
Uh-huh.

[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.280]
Do you remember about a year ago or so a guy called

[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.340]
and real-old Jerry Atrick do his bag about the bridge?

[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:05.920]
Yeah.

[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:07.760]
Wait a minute.

[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.080]
Wait, why are you referring to it in such a way

[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.440]
like we don't know what you're talking about?

[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.020]
The bridge tender?

[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.100]
I don't know if you have it on the card or not.

[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.700]
The bridge tender you've heard us play that a million times.

[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:18.840]
Come on.

[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.240]
I want you to play that thing and it's entirety though.

[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:21.640]
Cheers.

[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.180]
The bridge tender?

[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.660]
Yeah, that'll kill about four minutes.

[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.360]
No, the bridge tender you've got to be yanking my femur sir.

[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.520]
The whole thing in the entirety.

[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.280]
Oh, God.

[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.100]
That's like two and a half minutes long.

[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.080]
Yeah, it'll kill some great quality time.

[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:35.780]
Have a great weekend.

[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.460]
Thanks a lot.

[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:36.860]
Yes.

[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.680]
Big of a ride.

[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:39.740]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.640]
It's really kind of rude to be honest with you.

[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:42.360]
Boka.

[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:43.720]
Hey.

[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:44.360]
Yeah.

[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:45.580]
Yeah.

[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.260]
What a sporting one.

[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:47.700]
Yeah.

[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:48.980]
Why can't you play it?

[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:49.960]
What's the words that you can't play?

[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.220]
Gone.

[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.460]
I don't, you'd meet the crap out of me.

[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:52.900]
What's the problem?

[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.620]
How come we play that one thing where he says, uh, trousers, sneeze, but we can't do

[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.300]
trouser trout.

[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.480]
I don't see what's so bad about that.

[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.380]
Do you ever see a trout sneeze, by the way?

[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.260]
Something to think about.

[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.960]
I guess you're pocket.

[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.960]
I guess you're not, you're allowed to sneeze, but not between your knees.

[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.580]
I didn't think it was that bad.

[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.060]
I thought it was very innocuous and very amusing, but again, you're dealing with Cox

[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.040]
broadcasting, sir.

[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:12.540]
So it's a good way.

[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.800]
You're dealing with a bunch of nervous belly.

[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.440]
It's gone.

[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:15.140]
It's dead.

[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.380]
You're dealing with it on your best off tape.

[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.320]
Uh, well, we might be able to do that.

[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.180]
Hey, if you could do that, I mean, I love that.

[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:20.940]
That's what we ought to do.

[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.600]
We ought to pull out, put all the stuff on the tape that's coming here that we can't

[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.560]
play in here, which would probably fill up like the volume.

[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.660]
Yeah, like Howard does, right?

[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.100]
Right.

[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:27.860]
There you go.

[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.320]
That kind of crap, uh, yeah.

[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.440]
I guarantee Howard could play a trouser trout with no problem.

[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:33.460]
Of course.

[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:34.660]
He's got more money than this.

[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.340]
Just saying New York.

[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.480]
That's got nothing to do with it.

[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.340]
He don't work for a Cox broadcasting, okay?

[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.180]
Uh, if he don't work for the sisters.

[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.840]
Listen to the trick you can play on cups.

[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.420]
If you're driving down the road and you're drinking one of those root beers and a round

[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.840]
bottle, yeah, I've had them pull me over like three times or drinking root beer.

[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:51.660]
Do they know those beer?

[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.600]
Yeah, like those A and W's.

[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.440]
No, I just like give a bunch of crap and then they threaten to arrest me for harassment.

[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.060]
Mm-hmm.

[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.160]
When they pull me over in the first place, it'd be nice.

[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:00.920]
Mm-hmm.

[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:02.600]
Okay.

[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:03.700]
Hey, great life.

[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.960]
1135 at WIOD.

[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.140]
There's an open line out of town.

[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.220]
I'm not even giving the numbers out today because it's a shameless request day.

[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.300]
Let me take a little peek in this thing again here.

[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.860]
Boy, looks like Andy's been looking in there real close.

[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:15.960]
What are we doing now?

[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.540]
Oh, we're doing another pizza trough.

[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.340]
All right.

[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.760]
I'm getting choked up just thinking about it.

[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.340]
Man, you'll be making those same sounds once you've eaten at the pizza trough.

[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.420]
Pizza loft, pizza loft, L-O-F-T, happy now, Jeff, you sleazy slime bag with a disgusting

[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.620]
gross ponytail and keep your hair out of our lasagna, please.

[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:42.940]
Award-winning lasagna and stuffed shells and eggplant parmesan and great pizza, Fugaza

[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.820]
pizza stuffed with spicy sauce and onions or Sicilian pan pizza.

[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.520]
For those of you who like it real thick or New York style thin pizza or calzones and just

[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:57.420]
loads of great Italian goodies and a good minister on soup and great garlic rolls and canoli.

[00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.440]
What the hell more can you want?

[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:05.180]
Great food, very modest prices and you can just see Jeff and all of his world famous chefs

[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.060]
and cooks and waiters with no extra charge.

[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:08.360]
Okay.

[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.380]
Don't forget Tuesday, March 31st.

[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.320]
That's a week from this Tuesday.

[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.900]
I'm going to be there from 6 to 10 pm.

[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.500]
At least that's the time I figured out, Jeff, unless you want a better time.

[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.380]
That's what I'm going to be there with you, like it or not.

[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:22.120]
Tuesday, March 31st, 6 to 10 and we'll have some new t-shirts and some more of our best

[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.420]
of and all of this other crap.

[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:28.200]
Pizza loft, you'll find them just east of the Palmetto on Flagler Street.

[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.280]
The exact address is 69th and Flagler upstairs or call this number for delivery.

[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.640]
In fact, you can have your delivery put on your visa or a manager card which is almost

[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.100]
unheard of.

[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.900]
That's what a trustworthy guy, Jeff, is.

[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.760]
266-651-11.

[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:46.400]
Keep in mind for next year's Purim party, the Pizza loft is great holiday catering too.

[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.340]
The Pizza Trophy, you tell them that the Fatton Hill sent you by.

[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.780]
Excuse me, you.

[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.720]
In that book I made it clear.

[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.040]
The magic butt.

[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:01.120]
The magic butt.

[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.920]
What's other men is where I steer.

[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.380]
The magic butt.

[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.500]
At Roger Daltry I sometimes stare.

[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.580]
The magic butt.

[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.440]
I like his walk and I like his hair.

[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.920]
The magic butt.

[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.840]
I watch his jeans when he struts.

[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.140]
The magic butt.

[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.760]
I just love his magic butt.

[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.340]
The magic butt.

[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.060]
When we're on tour I just hope.

[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.520]
The magic butt.

[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:33.740]
He'll lose his grip.

[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.540]
And drop the soul.

[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.760]
The magic butt.

[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.340]
I see him.

[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.280]
I see him.

[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:42.420]
I see him.

[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.260]
You can't have him.

[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:44.500]

[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.020]
He can't have him.

[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:46.800]
The magic butt.

[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.120]
The magic butt.

[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.380]
The magic butt.

[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:49.940]
The magic butt.

[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:50.620]
The magic butt.

[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.720]
So anyway, it's Logan 41 at WIO.

[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.400]
D we have an open line at day 751-WIO-O-N-D.

[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.780]
And we got Rick and Suds at Joe Robbie Stadium this afternoon from 2 to 6.

[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.960]
God only knows what they're going to do.

[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.940]
They're sitting in an empty stadium for 4 hours.

[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.280]
But hey, that's the way we do it here on WIO-O-N-D.

[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.580]
And we got the Yankees in the Braves exhibition game tonight.

[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.180]
We don't have it on the air, but we have it.

[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.080]
How come we're not broadcasting that game?

[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.320]
Being part of the Yankee Network, how come we're not doing that?

[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:18.880]
Well, that's okay.

[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.960]
We got something a lot better than that.

[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.400]
We got Hank with D on tonight.

[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:22.520]
Miami.

[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.780]
Hello, Nioh.

[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:25.400]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.800]
Hey, I've been a lot load.

[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:27.360]
Woo!

[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.860]
I've been listening to it since 1970.

[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.760]
I've been through a lot with your station.

[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:32.680]
1970?

[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:33.420]
Yeah.

[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.600]
What does that mean?

[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.020]
Well, I mean, I've been through the urine lady, the cod liver oil guy, the spoon benders.

[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:40.680]
Uh-huh.

[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.040]
But this turgent stuff's really got me worried.

[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:43.700]
Yeah.

[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.480]
Last night, I cut my wife, washing my underwear in deep turgent.

[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:49.260]
Uh-huh.

[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.860]
I'm worried about it.

[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.720]
You haven't listened to this in 1970, you're right.

[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.100]
Right.

[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:54.580]
Long time.

[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:54.940]
Yeah.

[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.580]
I call my buddy Paul Penny Pinture of douchebag.

[00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:58.980]
Okay.

[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.400]
I have a great day, sir.

[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.000]
Nioh.

[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:01.260]
Yeah.

[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.280]
Can you play the on and on disease?

[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:04.960]
Car...

[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.380]
Car...

[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.660]
What does that call?

[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:07.500]
It's not what it's called.

[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.460]
Yeah, on and on.

[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.160]
On and on, anonymous or something like that.

[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.100]
Well, I'll have to dig around for it.

[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:12.940]
I'm going to make a big effort.

[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:13.580]
Okay.

[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.280]
There's one other thing.

[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:15.020]
What is it?

[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:15.980]
I figured out...

[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:16.700]
On and on and on.

[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.120]
Right.

[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.360]
I figured out why the bears lost to the dolphins this year.

[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:20.780]
Yeah.

[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:21.820]
That last second play.

[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:22.320]
Yeah.

[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:27.480]
It was Jim Ession walking behind my dick, clapping his hands.

[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:28.380]
Okay.

[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.900]
Have a great day.

[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:30.860]
See you.

[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:31.480]
Wow.

[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:33.620]
What does he want to hear?

[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.480]
Look, is that in the...

[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.780]
He sure did it for me.

[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.500]
I'll tell you that.

[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.020]
What does it call, George?

[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:42.960]
On and on and on.

[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.440]
On and on and on.

[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.940]
And that's the way it goes.

[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.080]
I don't think that's in here.

[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:48.640]
But I'll check.

[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.100]
I'm checking for you, sir.

[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.380]
If not, it's in our thing, man.

[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.300]
It's going...

[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.100]
On and on and on.

[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:53.980]
How do you like that?

[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.480]
14 cuts, 17.

[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.480]
I'll get it for you, sir.

[00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:58.740]
Just take a deep breath now.

[00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.300]
Just inhale.

[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.280]
Ah!

[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.400]
God, I wish I could just get this last four pounds of flem out of my throat.

[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.220]
From this cold, I'd be in good shape.

[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:07.020]
Ah!

[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.400]
Oh, good.

[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.620]
We could make a little cake for a nildon Monday with it.

[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.880]
Here's a lady in sunny Isles.

[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:14.400]
Hi, Neil.

[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:14.920]
How are you?

[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:15.340]
Okay.

[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.180]
Take some more hot tea and lemon and hot wine.

[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.000]
No, no, I'm all...

[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.840]
There's always just a little hangover there, so to speak.

[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.400]
I know.

[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.240]
I call it a post nasal drip.

[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.260]
It drops down the back.

[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.720]
We've heard from a few drips this morning as a matter of fact.

[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:29.280]
Neil.

[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:29.980]
Recently, yeah.

[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:34.240]
I need some advice for you even more than hearing a cart.

[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.620]
Sunday, those Marlin applications are coming out.

[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.080]
Mm-hmm.

[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.240]
And...

[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.120]
Mine has been, of course, expect to mail it at 801 in the morning.

[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.360]
Are you getting founders' club seats for yourself?

[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:52.100]
No, I am not.

[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.360]
I have no interest in that.

[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.100]
That's for food or intellectuals.

[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.160]
Why would I be interested in that?

[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.100]
Why do I...

[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.780]
It's a little bit of an elite.

[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.660]
I don't, I'm not an elitist.

[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.060]
I don't...

[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.620]
Listen, let me say something to you.

[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.080]
Okay.

[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.860]
Whatever anybody else wants to do, that's fine.

[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:08.860]
As long as they leave me alone.

[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.500]
But I don't go to a ball game to be seen by people.

[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.000]
Did I say?

[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.380]
I don't go there like the women who go to the hockey games in Canada with their

[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.800]
ferk, the main coats, and sit in the front-red seats.

[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.140]
I'm not interested in that.

[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.480]
I go to enjoy the game and have a hot dog and scream and yell and just have a good time.

[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.560]
And be left alone.

[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.020]
That's all.

[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.520]
I don't go there to be elite or to be a hot shot, which is why they can take the

[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.140]
WIOD sky box and they can jam it up their butt.

[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.180]
So, are you getting in there?

[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.180]
Because they have all these phonies up there and all the sales people and all the

[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.480]
management people and people up there wouldn't know a ball game from their armpit.

[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.720]
And I just don't...

[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.640]
I don't have fun doing that.

[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.660]
I just want to go have fun.

[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.760]
Now, are you going to get an infield box?

[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:48.980]
I'm getting a club bomb.

[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:49.940]
I'm getting the club seats.

[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:50.720]
The club seats?

[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.360]
That Mr. Ponytail has.

[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.460]
I see.

[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.780]
Why do you keep asking me what I'm getting?

[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:56.580]
Well...

[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.220]
What are you getting?

[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.080]
I've never been to the stadium.

[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.760]
So, and I don't really love stadiums.

[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.560]
I have to be fairly close to the action.

[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.180]
What does that mean?

[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:06.980]
Why?

[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.220]
I don't like looking down.

[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.600]
It feels like I'm falling down.

[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:12.960]
Oh, you're afraid of heights.

[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:13.320]
Yeah.

[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.740]
So, get the box seats.

[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:15.640]
Get infield boxes.

[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:16.880]
Infield boxes.

[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.940]
They're great for baseballs.

[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.120]
Longs don't get them too low, though.

[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:19.980]
Mm-hmm.

[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.520]
You want to be a few rows back.

[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.900]
Well, those will be starting to come out.

[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.180]
Unless you want those people who wants to sit in the first row

[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.560]
with the Founders box and reach over and pat the guys on the butt,

[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.400]
that kind of stuff.

[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.160]
Well, I thought I'd be seen on television.

[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.020]
There you go.

[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.140]
Oh, you want to be like that white-haired lady in the club's games

[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:35.820]
that wriggly field.

[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.780]
Every time Harry sings, take me out to the ballgame.

[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.960]
Every time they've got to show this one white-haired old bag.

[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.180]
She's an air-vee game.

[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.220]
And for whatever reason, she always catches the eye of the cameraman.

[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.240]
Every day we've got to see this babe.

[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.140]
Oh, God.

[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:48.520]
Huh.

[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.280]
Well, I told my husband I was calling you.

[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.220]
And he's listening.

[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.760]
So now he'll never get those Founders club seats.

[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.900]
It's up to you.

[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.320]
Why do people care what I'm going to do?

[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.200]
I mean, what difference does it make, OK?

[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.660]
You know, you're a kind of sore.

[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.640]
No, I'm not.

[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:06.820]
No, I'm not.

[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.940]
I've never seen a baseball game at your Robbie Stadium.

[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.280]
I forgot my dolphin tickets, but that's for football.

[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.080]
I wouldn't want my football seats for baseball.

[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.080]
It's too far out, as they say.

[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.020]
So I've never even been inside the stadium.

[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.500]
Well, you're like the stadium, believe me.

[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:21.520]
It's a beautiful stadium.

[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.900]
There are very few bad seats.

[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.160]
And it's just the atmosphere is brand new.

[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:25.940]
And it's sparkling.

[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:26.560]
And it's clean.

[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.360]
And you'll love it.

[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.100]
Trust me.

[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:28.220]
OK.

[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.920]
I do trust you.

[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:30.900]
That's why I called you.

[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.160]
OK.

[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:31.880]
Have a great day.

[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.760]
And tell your husband to butcher.

[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.340]
OK.

[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.200]
Bye-bye.

[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:36.860]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.600]
How about some macaroni and cheese?

[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.180]
You know, that will, I mean, you know, make up your own mind.

[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.040]
Guys, come on.

[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.040]
And butcher up a little bit, damn it.

[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.320]
I'm 47 at WIOD.

[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.960]
Speaking of butcher up, how about that mark racing,

[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.860]
that new butcher brush cut, that haircut?

[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.280]
What do they call those now?

[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.020]
See, years ago, those were either like a brush cut or a crew cut.

[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.820]
And all the guys like in the Navy wore those.

[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.640]
Another military guys all had a crew cut.

[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:03.660]
Now, they wouldn't use that.

[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:04.500]
What would they call them now?

[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.080]
Spike.

[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.320]
No, no.

[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.300]
He's not spiked.

[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.220]
No, no, no.

[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.060]
I know what you're talking about.

[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.760]
Now, this is just like a regular military, you know,

[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:13.880]
a flat top.

[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.920]
A flat top.

[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.480]
That's even worse than the other ones.

[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.440]
Well, anyway, if you're flat on top,

[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.380]
and not because you got to cut that way,

[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.580]
but because it stopped growing some time ago, what a segway.

[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.360]
Check the Charles Alfie Erie hair system.

[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.240]
Man, it looks great.

[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:29.820]
That's what Paul Sangus said.

[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:30.620]
He said, it looks great.

[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:31.840]
It matches his thing.

[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.560]
And it's affordable, too.

[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.720]
It's priced at just $600.

[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.560]
In fact, it does match your own hair.

[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.460]
Instead of, you know, a lot of these guys that have wings,

[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.480]
they have like a little tiny bit of brown hair on the side.

[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.600]
And they got like a dark black wig in the middle.

[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.420]
And a few gray hairs in between.

[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.920]
It looks like it's color-coded, man.

[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:47.980]
All over their heads are ridiculous.

[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.980]
But the Charles Alfie Erie system blends in with your own hair.

[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.880]
It's a non-surgical method that creates the look and feel of your own hair.

[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.900]
And also gives you the freedom to take part in any and all activities,

[00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.500]
like swimming with the boys,

[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.440]
and skydiving and showering with manage and the adults.

[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.740]
So check it out.

[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.580]
It's sold here with a complete no-risk guarantee.

[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.520]
You'll wear it for 30 days.

[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.040]
If you're not completely satisfied,

[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.580]
return it for a full refund.

[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.900]
For a free consultation with no obligation, call the hair people,

[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.640]
the Charles Alfie Erie people at 1-800-321-2413.

[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.920]
1-800-321-2413.

[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.260]
If you're in date, county, it's 375-08-08.

[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.120]
375-08-08, hair for the 90s.

[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.480]
Yeah, then I thought, well, hell, I'll just recode the driveway with sealers

[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.800]
or won't crack, you know what I said.

[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.520]
Once that moisture gets in there, it's bound to make a mess of things, you know.

[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.660]
You leak them every day.

[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.780]
People talk on and on and on.

[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.160]
My brother-in-law says he knew a guy that can get me a deal.

[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.620]
Now there's help for these people.

[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.560]
An organization called On and On and On.

[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.960]
We can help cure vivacity, redundancy, and embarrassing bladder problems.

[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:55.500]
If I can't have your attention for just a moment, please!

[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.400]
Hey, shut the f*** up!

[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:04.720]
Now, I'd like to welcome a new member to On and On and On.

[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.200]
Hi, my name is Bill, and I'm a compulsive talker.

[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.060]
Hi, Bill!

[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.140]
Hi, you see my bill, Hi!

[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.420]
On and On.

[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:19.060]
If someone you know is a talker, like, call 1-900-On and On and On today.

[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.580]
The line will be busy.

[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:21.680]
But please keep trying.

[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.720]
On and On and On!

[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.340]
11.52 at WIWD.

[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.520]
Somebody in the newsroom tell Andy we got his play girl magazine for him in here.

[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.380]
Here's a lady with a pig report.

[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.440]
Hello, Neil!

[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.140]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:43.820]
We have a major pig report on 595 going west between Flamingo and 136th Avenue.

[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.240]
There's about eight up and far to five.

[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:45.440]
Eight!

[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:46.980]
Wow.

[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.300]
There they are! They're dumping them like you can't believe.

[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.140]
Yeah, well that's great.

[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.900]
They want to make sure you have a real pleasant weekend.

[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.180]
Absolutely. Go get her out there and look at people now.

[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:55.640]
Okay.

[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:56.660]
Thank you.

[00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.020]
Bye-bye.

[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.020]
11.53 at WIWD.

[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.460]
Boy, I am so...

[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.100]
This 930 to 10 is killing me.

[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.440]
Let's put that on the record, okay?

[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.120]
I can't do this, man.

[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.080]
This extra half hour is just killing me.

[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.260]
It is an abation, man.

[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.320]
Oh, speaking of an abation, here's Robin the Jeweler.

[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.020]
How you doing, Robin?

[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:19.640]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.100]
Okay.

[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.000]
How's everything?

[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:23.160]
I'm tired, man. I'm worn out.

[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.500]
I need a long rest.

[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.720]
Long weekend rest?

[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.100]
A long... I think I'm going to sleep all day tomorrow.

[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.000]
All day.

[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.280]
Yeah. That sound good?

[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.340]
Sounds good to me.

[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.440]
Just hibernate.

[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.220]
But I'm going to do tomorrow.

[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:33.680]
Yeah.

[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.120]
What was that, Robin?

[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.720]
Hey, somebody on the other end just hugged me.

[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.040]
What the hell's going on in your phone, Robin?

[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.140]
I'm going back to you, baby.

[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.720]
Listen, I got a request.

[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:43.580]
Yeah?

[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.420]
I got to call my mother a douchebag for pulling on my ear last night.

[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.740]
She pulled on your ear?

[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:52.400]
Yeah, I got an ear, a fake earring, and she yaked it off my ear and cut my ear open.

[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.280]
No.

[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:53.840]
Yeah.

[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.300]
Really?

[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:54.700]
Yeah.

[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.840]
What told you do that for?

[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:56.800]
She thought it was a ruin.

[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:57.720]
She got upset at me.

[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.000]
I told her to mind her own damn business.

[00:27:59.200 --> 00:27:59.200]

[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:03.680]
Tell her you're going to go out swimming and sit around in your wet bathing suit and get a bladder infection just out of spite.

[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:04.440]
How do you like that?

[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:05.700]
No.

[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:06.800]
And I got some notes for you.

[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.240]
The rest are out in this building, you?

[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:08.680]
Yeah.

[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.680]
Just got a new addition to their menu.

[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.920]
It's called Chicken Steak or Randall.

[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:13.840]
Really?

[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:14.240]
Yeah.

[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.980]
Well, I'm getting for that any day.

[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.260]
I thought I'd send you one over on my phone.

[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.340]
I'd like to sync my teeth into that right about now.

[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.600]
I'll send you one over on my phone.

[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:20.780]
Yeah.

[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:22.200]
Okay.

[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.920]
And can you play that set and Rick starts?

[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.060]
I'm going to put that on an endless loop.

[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:28.920]
That's great.

[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.320]
That's a great card you got.

[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.160]
Well, Robin, have a great day and tell your mom she's a sleaze bag.

[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.100]
Have a good weekend, yeah.

[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:34.480]
You too.

[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.100]
I'm going to rush the timeline passes off to the top of the key taken by Julius.

[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:38.640]
He drives.

[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.140]
Oh, my!

[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.760]
What an electrifying one in.

[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.820]
It's Windmill Dan.

[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.020]
The doctor.

[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:44.560]
Hi.

[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:45.980]
Yes, it's the doctor.

[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.620]
And when I want a fast break from the usual breakfast routine, there's only one place for me.

[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.420]
Slam Dunkin' Donuts.

[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.580]
Check out the All Star Liner.

[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.420]
They got Dale Dawkins, Jack Luffin, Thunder Donuts, Wheels Jammin' and Finger Rolls, and even Moses Malone.

[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.640]
One handed Jam Fear Donuts.

[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:03.260]
Mmm.

[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:04.500]
Hey, Doc.

[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.300]
How about a box and one to go?

[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.000]
Yeah, baby.

[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.220]
And give me a cup of coffee.

[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.940]
My one, medium one, uh, a larger one.

[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:12.880]
A larger one.

[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.400]
But no Korean, please.

[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:15.900]
Oh, that's bad.

[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:19.140]
So make your best move to Slam Dunkin' Donuts.

[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.520]
We stub off food in your face.

[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:24.740]
So what's your goal for?

[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.240]
Well, I was on the other guy's ballot.

[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:27.720]
What other guy?

[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.000]
The Republican guy.

[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:30.440]
Oh, no, man.

[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.040]
Yeah, I know.

[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:31.720]
I'm sorry today.

[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.380]
I didn't want to break it.

[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.680]
Which one did your goal for today?

[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.000]
I'm not going to get into it, Chad.

[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.000]
You'll freak out on me, okay?

[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:38.600]
Not...no way.

[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.060]
Yeah.

[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.680]
That, uh, that hooded freak.

[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.380]
Which one?

[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:45.380]
This is specific.

[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.000]
Which is name, man.

[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.340]
I'm not going to argue, Paul.

[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.800]
The guy from CNN.

[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.580]
Ted Turner, yes.

[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:52.620]
Oh, man.

[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.180]
Do you vote it for B.P.

[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:54.580]
And then?

[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.840]
I voted for Ted Turner.

[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.460]
Dude, what is it?

[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.640]
You just send the police right into my pad.

[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:00.540]
I do.

[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.100]
Why don't you give them my phone number and it's red.

[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:04.820]
Ted.

[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.360]
And let them come over and kill me.

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.940]
Man, you're gonna elect the thought police.

[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:12.520]
Ted.

[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.860]
This wasn't a presidential election.

[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.240]
This is a primary, okay?

[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.680]
I didn't have a chance to vote for the other side.

[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.080]
Give me the chance to vote for the other side.

[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:20.300]
Rick.

[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.300]
What?

[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.680]
My pal Rick voted for a Nazi.

[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:25.860]
I knew this would be...

[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.300]
I didn't vote for a Nazi.

[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.860]
Wait, does he have a lot of hoodspot?

[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:31.840]
Deliciously different,

[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.800]
Merrill, one of deliciously different,

[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.240]
Merrill, one of...

[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.240]
A lot of confused people here at WIOD.

[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:40.740]
I agree.

[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.240]
We have an open line in the starline,

[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.100]
star IOD, and he out of townline.

[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.420]
He's just kind of sitting there now,

[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.080]
making up their old mind whether they're gonna stick their finger in the phone

[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.720]
and their nose or someplace else.

[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.100]
Miami, hello.

[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:51.680]
Hey!

[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:52.200]
Yeah.

[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:52.660]
Neil.

[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:53.280]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.160]
Long time, listen up first time call.

[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:55.760]
Okay.

[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:57.080]
Listen up.

[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.980]
It's very hard for me to call because I'm usually out on a truck.

[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.640]
And I get to hear your shows from the beginning to end.

[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.520]
But I can never call you.

[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.060]
And you talk about so many interesting topics and stuff,

[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.220]
but I can never call it.

[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.400]
Well, that's what they all say.

[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.160]
That's you excuse.

[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:12.200]
I know.

[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:12.880]
Right.

[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.940]
Yesterday, I was listening to a circumcised,

[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:17.680]
an unsurconcised.

[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:18.800]
Yeah.

[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.000]
And his girlfriend...

[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.880]
That was when he said...

[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.100]
...that the theory was that the circumcised,

[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.640]
circumcised yourself, it would fall off.

[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:28.260]
Yeah.

[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.260]
I had never heard that.

[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:30.380]
Well, now you did.

[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.500]
And I was in poor.

[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.180]
I mean, we weren't rich, but we were poor in Cuba either.

[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.180]
But what does that mean?

[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:37.420]
But I got circumcised.

[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.460]
Well, good for you.

[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:38.840]
You know?

[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.420]
Let's end this guy on metal.

[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:41.320]
Yeah, I'm talking.

[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.320]
There you go.

[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:42.940]
Neil.

[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:43.420]
Yeah.

[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.580]
I got a couple of big stories.

[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:45.120]
Okay.

[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.900]
I wrote a room and I'm going to kiss your butt here,

[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.420]
but I got a couple of requests.

[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:49.740]
All right.

[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:50.520]
All right.

[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.160]
First of all, I like to clap.

[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.060]
An anthropo-mergen friend of mine,

[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.400]
who works here at Victoria Hospital,

[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.220]
Ralph and his cousin, Newton,

[00:31:59.760 --> 00:31:59.980]
John,

[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.320]
their major douchebag.

[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:03.220]
Thank you.

[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.940]
And Freddie, for makes ready equipment.

[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:06.600]
Yeah.

[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.100]
He's another major douchebag.

[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:08.460]
Yeah.

[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:09.280]
Definitely.

[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.960]
He's an amazing douchebag.

[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:11.320]
Yeah.

[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:11.940]
Yeah.

[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:12.580]
Okay.

[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:14.700]
And for the truck driver, I'm trying to hit the ramp.

[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.080]
Yeah.

[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.220]
That's another anthropo-mergen douchebag.

[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:17.620]
Yeah.

[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:18.520]
He's truck.

[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.220]
Okay.

[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.180]
Can't drive.

[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:20.800]
Okay.

[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:21.360]
What now?

[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:21.880]
In closing.

[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:22.840]
Come on, wrap it up.

[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:23.920]
I'm getting like hemorrhage from the school.

[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.800]
Can you play that burp in his song?

[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:26.340]
Okay.

[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.820]
And Freddie, for makes ready, he wants to roby Benson as God.

[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:30.580]
Okay.

[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.460]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:31.780]
Bye.

[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:32.060]
Bye.

[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.820]
Robbie Benson is God.

[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.420]
You know, I saw Robbie Benson on a preview of some show he was going to be on.

[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.160]
And I got to be honest with him.

[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.000]
I'm embarrassed for him.

[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:42.940]
He still looks the same.

[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.920]
He's got to be, what, 35, 38.

[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.160]
He's got to be like pushing 40.

[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.920]
He still looks 16 years old.

[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.360]
There's something going on in that family that we don't know about.

[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.480]
But we do know he circumcised.

[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.020]
We have an open line in day, 751, WIOD.

[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:02.240]
Alex, take Andy and his play girl magazine there in the newsroom so he doesn't miss anything out.

[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.320]
He might some fun.

[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.380]
And listen to the music.

[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:04.760]
I will.

[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.580]
I've asked my case.

[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.680]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:18.680]

[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:18.680]

[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:18.680]

[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:18.680]

[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:18.680]

[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:18.940]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:18.940]

[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:18.940]

[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:19.000]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:19.920]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:20.620]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.440]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.220]

[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:31.920]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.340]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:34.740]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.560]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:40.880]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:41.660]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:41.660]

[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:41.660]

[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:41.660]

[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:41.660]

[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:41.660]

[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:41.700]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:41.780]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:41.940]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.440]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.640]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:44.800]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:45.920]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:46.620]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:46.660]
I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:46.660]

[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:46.660]

[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:46.660]

[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:46.660]

[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:46.640]

[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:46.640]

[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:46.640]

[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:46.640]

[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:46.640]

[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:46.640]

[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:46.640]

[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:46.640]

[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:46.640]

[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:46.640]
