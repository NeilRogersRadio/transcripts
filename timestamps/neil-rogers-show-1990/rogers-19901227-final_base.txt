[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]
10 W I O

[00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.020]
Okay, like I start to say

[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.340]
We could be eating by 1115 and we played our cards right. I think today is a great day for a Wayne Arnold party

[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.660]
Don't you big party?

[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.420]
gigantic Wayne and Murray get get on the stick boys. We're gonna really do it up big today

[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.020]
We're gonna just eat till we die right on the year today, right?

[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.340]
Because it's a bogus nobody is even in the parking lot you notice next door also a channel seven

[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.680]
It must be at a busman's holiday

[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.700]
Sally went out to recharge her batteries everybody is out of town everybody's taking a busman's holiday

[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.140]
This is all make believe between now and next Wednesday

[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.760]
It's all just feeling it's all like punishment. No, most everybody's playing hooky. They're either on vacation or goofing off

[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.640]
We're here and we're not too happy about it to be honest with you

[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.200]
We don't want to do formal hours. I'm Godfather three because then Steve and Ripus again. It was terminal terminal

[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.120]
Yeah, how big is it baby?

[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.280]
That's his whole new thing now over there

[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.260]
You know, I said that I wasn't gonna talk about them, but it's so embarrassing

[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.360]
I'll talk about whatever the hell I want to talk about his whole new thing now is to see how many times it can use the word penis on here

[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.680]
That's the whole deal over there

[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.540]
In fact, that's gonna be when they make the change

[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.240]
They're gonna have a like what's gonna look like a mushroom my guess is gonna be the new logo

[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.580]
Reptile it's gonna be called all penis radio and

[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.180]
Quite frankly with the staff they're putting together

[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.200]
I think they got a hell of a head start if I can say that anyway. That's my opinion. I'm like Disney

[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.140]
It's 10.07 at W.I. I was gonna play a thing there at the beginning

[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.940]
I was kind of toying between a whole bunch of things today because I was thinking to play in the whole rack today and tomorrow

[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.920]
And on Monday Tuesday's New Year's day we got off Tuesday

[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.580]
What are we doing on Tuesday? We got ball games right lots of ball games

[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.380]
Marmite of course the blockbuster bowl or waiting in anticipation of the guy coming by with a 300 bucks today

[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.800]
For Camilla's house for those two great

[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.000]
Club seats and the preferred parking pass that Jeff Cohen from pizza loft have donated yesterday

[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.480]
what a guy and

[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.980]
Our total as of this moment. We don't have any mail in yet today

[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.940]
Is there anybody up front anybody in the building doing anything worthwhile?

[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.120]
They all just kind of wandering around and where's my check by the way?

[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.420]
Let's make sure I get that real early. Okay, just in case anything goes wrong

[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.680]
But our total as of yesterday and it's still the same today because we don't have any mail nobody's really doing much of anything

[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.780]
92,000. Where's all that activity on there by the way? Was that all bogus? Oh?

[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.160]
Yeah, oh, that's interesting. You notice how about two weeks ago? We got a lot of

[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.420]
Interesting stuff going on there must be just a coincidence

[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.040]
92,670 dollars for Camilla's house on

[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.760]
real

[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.340]
And we got them sure a bunch of mail coming in today if we ever get it sorted out if the post office ever gets off their dead ass

[00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.100]
I mean Christmas is over guys. Okay. That's generally the big excuse Christmas holiday rush and we get tons of mail

[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.700]
It's always daylight in the dollar short and it's all over

[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.660]
But I have a feeling they're probably screwing off too over there at the post office

[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.200]
So we should be well definitely will go over 93,000 to they one way or the other make no mistake about that if we fall a little short

[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.860]
Georgia will take care of that with no problem. He promised me

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.820]
Also we are in limbo can't eat open in our illustrious sales department is

[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.100]
Checking it out seeing who's being naughty and nice on that called a remote for a week from tomorrow

[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.700]
We're kind of like putting the finishing

[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.280]
touches on that aren't we make sure if we're it's gonna happen and how it's gonna happen and all of that

[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.600]
So kind of like lay back on it till we find out exactly what's going on

[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.820]
George went out so a movie last night. I don't want to mention it again because then

[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.020]
Oh is it outside? Oh geez. I forgot about it. I'll be damned. I can't believe it. I forgot

[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.100]
It's okay. It wasn't on

[00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.880]
There was wasn't on the feet. There's no not planning this week. I didn't they didn't say on the feed last week

[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.620]
There was no not planning this week. Oh

[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.680]
But I got up I put it on and there was nothing there. I said well if I had gotten up that early and I'd have turned it on to say

[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.800]
In fact, I tuned in on the satellite it tuned in channel last night

[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.400]
Thinking that I was gonna get up this morning to watch and I forgot all about it

[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.180]
So it wasn't there and I thought well why isn't it here so I was gonna see it and there's a movie on

[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.060]
I can see it's a hot. We get preempted so many damn times you know

[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.860]
Damn

[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.880]
There was nothing there probably have to go out and watch godfather three again tonight. Yeah, I think I might do that

[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.840]
I haven't seen it yet. Oh you haven't seen it all well

[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.140]
We don't want to talk about it because it's terminal and we did four hours on it yesterday

[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.780]
We're gonna get our ruler out instead see

[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.260]
It was great meeting you see if Andy Garcia measures up to expectations

[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.740]
So it's not on man

[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.500]
As soon as I saw that I'm the screen here. I saw that you were on there. I thought oh boy screwed up again didn't do my homework

[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.320]
So we can't ruin it for anybody else like we ruined the movie

[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.600]
Did you notice that the unmancipable movie broke all the all-time box office records for a single day?

[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.080]
I mean it is terminal to talk about it because nobody cares about that. They much rather hear about how big Steve's the thing

[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.380]
You know

[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.960]
But god I can't believe it

[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.800]
So people are aligning up. It's worth it. You'll enjoy it even George enjoyed and he's pretty critical

[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.260]
He's a mr. Critic, but he liked it a lot

[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.840]
I don't like it you got my intercept yesterday. He also said that Sophia

[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.140]
Mary a Corleon Sophia a copula he said that her nose looks like Mount Rushmore

[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.620]
With the six earthquakes on it. I mean it's it's so big that it looks like it's broken in six places

[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.860]
Uh-oh, but it's the bigger than Barry Manelis

[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.480]
You mean her nose

[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:50.640]
Have a great day and let me know how you like it. Okay, and the movie too. It's the movie too. See you

[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.200]
The not-slanding lady saves us from further embarrassment to show us not tonight. Well, that's okay

[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.880]
We'll get we'll get by another week without Pat Peterson's somewhere

[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.460]
It's 11 after 10 at W.I.O.D

[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.760]
And we're kind of like torn between a rock and a hard place because it's a bogus day

[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.440]
Everybody knows that everybody's just kind of screwing off

[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.200]
Kind of nice though this week coming to a traffic is very light. I left the house almost nine o'clock this morning

[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.440]
And I was here is that possible? Yeah, I let the house

[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.980]
About the six seven minutes tonight. I was here before nine thirty in credible

[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.300]
There's no, but there's not a dog out there man. It's great

[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:31.060]
Oh, speaking of traffic last night Jim Bohan in this villain in Per King, which is the only reason I would ever punch it up

[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.640]
And they had some boring guy on there talking about driving and driver safety and about the teaching

[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.800]
Driver aid and young drivers and they were going through all this crap about the insurance companies statistics

[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.600]
And they say that young women teenage women and young women are the best drivers

[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.540]
That is such a pile of crap. I have never heard anything so ridiculous. Am I right?

[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.960]
They are terrified and stupid when it comes to driving. They shouldn't even be allowed in a car

[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.860]
Okay, let me do the break and then I'll talk about that for just a minute

[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.220]
There's a reason for those statistics, okay

[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.800]
You know what it reminds me of it's like the crime statistics for Las Vegas

[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.280]
And they always say all boy there's the person the percent of crime with all of a sudden

[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.960]
There's way up there Vegas got a lot of crime

[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.940]
The statistics in Vegas are related to the permanent population which is very small

[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.440]
So it seems like they have a lot of crime per capita

[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.020]
But the fact is when you when you factor in the millions of tourists who are there every year all year long

[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:32.960]
The actual crime rate is incredibly low. It's almost nil. So you can do anything with statistics

[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.200]
Anyway, you don't need any statistical it is because it looks like the movie's gonna make a lot of money

[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.660]
After the movies over they can get the same plastic surgeon that worked on Mark Hamill

[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.340]
I was just thinking about that because they had the thing from Star Wars

[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.780]
Mark Hamill of course was an at horrible accident in a Corvette

[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.960]
I think wasn't it? You'd rather that in a brutal accident and they

[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.520]
Pasted them all together again, and he's like he looks like he was 15 years old again. Okay, it's cute

[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.160]
Actually, he's about 86 now nobody realizes that but they like

[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.520]
Kind of like Dave Johnson plastic surgery. So if they could do that with the Sophia

[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.420]
There may be a chance if they could put her nose where her

[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.260]
They could put her cheeks where her chin is supposed to be and her nose where the Mondoan shine

[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:19.760]
At her lips behind her they could tuck it behind her your neck or something man. She is gruesome

[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.280]
Anyway, it's 1018 at W. I. O. D. Let's take a collar to here and just see which way the wind is gonna blow today

[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.940]
Here's pop it. Oh, whoops. Pop it. Oh Beach nail. Yes, sir

[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.360]
I saw the godfather yesterday and I

[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.900]
We're not gonna do that again. Are we I don't care. No, let's do another four hours just to piss Steve off

[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.120]
There's just one question I have

[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.100]
Well actually a couple I noticed in the previews

[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.940]
There were some scenes that weren't in the movie but in fact a lot of them. Did you notice this? Yeah

[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.780]
You know like uh were uh

[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:49.660]
the

[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.140]
Uh cousin

[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.600]
Spitz and the guy's hands

[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.780]
Well, a perched a perched bell got upset about that and had to cut it out in soft florida

[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.060]
And worry by the way, have you ever seen a perched bell and Jackie Mason together?

[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:10.740]
Well, he's gonna be playing at the sunrise. So uh, yeah, I think that's right. He's an idiot. Okay. Go ahead and Abe too

[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.880]
Yeah, uh, by the way, you see Jackie Mason is paying for the ball dropping in time square

[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.620]
I knew you're seeing these paying for it. That's what we need. Yeah

[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.240]
but when

[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:27.740]
Michael says everybody in this room the ball the drug deal is in this room. We're dropped that. I'd be doing one line. Right. It says that right

[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.700]
The scene outside the house where

[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:39.440]
What's the guy's name Vince? Vincent. Yeah, it says what you'll you have me do stay away from my daughter never says that he says it inside

[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.840]
But anyway, let's let's not subtle intellectualize this. Did you like it or not? I like that. I thought it was pretty good

[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.600]
Especially the ending part. I thought that was that was probably

[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.640]
The best best part of the home movie. Yeah, and the last scene you mean

[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.920]
Uh, not the last scene, but just before the little oh yeah, oh yeah, I was cheering for that

[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.840]
You know, I thought it was a great climax. Mm-hmm. So to speak more or less. Yeah

[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.500]
And in closing, I just like to call all the people at CRC press douchebag. Okay. Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it

[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.860]
Okay, great American see how do you like that?

[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.840]
That probably talk about it for weeks to come. It's the happening of the century

[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.000]
But it's terminal terminal how big is it Steve?

[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:28.220]
20 after 10 at W. I. O. D. Let me give those numbers out. Although we got some calls on there. Oh, is line five still broken

[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:34.120]
Man, I'm gonna I'm gonna do four hours one day pretty soon on Larry mixing in those fakers at southern bell

[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.920]
I understand it's the holidays

[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:41.320]
But this is supposed to be a goddamn radio station and we're supposed to be doing a damn talk show here

[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.860]
Okay, and we have a sick line in brown. Listen

[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.020]
You hear it? That's all it ever comes on here. It's broken. It's been broken for now

[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.100]
Tomorrow from what I understand because I was a wind vacation

[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.920]
I was plunging my brains in Vegas and the line broke on a Friday tomorrow will be two weeks to the day

[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.520]
That it's been broken

[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.100]
So how we doing? How did we make out is it a go and no go or no

[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.120]
Under consideration time to consider this okay

[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:16.260]
Uh 21 after 10 we're still working at thing out with calder because they're basically they don't know what they're doing over there

[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:25.180]
We all know that there's an open line in Palm Beach 655 946 3 655 W. I. O. D. And of course we got line five and browned

[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.820]
crank it up open at pot

[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.720]
Two weeks. It's been like that. It's sick

[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:38.420]
It's screwed up. It's broke and you people over at Southern Bell are sitting on your dead ass while we're paying through the nose

[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:44.200]
Through the hose for gigantic phone bills and the service were getting. I wouldn't wish on uh anybody

[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.440]
I wouldn't wish this service on Mike Miller. Okay, that's how bad it is. That's really saying something

[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:58.660]
All right 1022 I'm W. I would wish it on Paul Lyle. I wouldn't wish it on Joey Reynolds and Bill Marshall. How do you like that?

[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.060]
Let's do a break my O. D. I never finished what I started to say about the driving thing

[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.700]
See those statistics are vogus because stop and think about it

[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:15.920]
When a young guy when a teenage guy at his girlfriend are in a car together. Who does the driving 99% of the time?

[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.900]
Guy does when a young couple

[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.360]
Mary

[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:26.060]
Are going somewhere in fact couple of any age for that matter, but we're talking about young drivers when young couples are going somewhere

[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:29.420]
Who does the driving the guy does again 99% of the time?

[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:34.640]
So the amount of miles driven by young males so far exceeds the amount of miles driven by young women

[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.960]
That naturally they're going to be far more accidents etc

[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.900]
Young women especially in this town. I don't want to get into an ethnic thing

[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.300]
But there are young women George. I'm sorry, but man they don't know what they're all are doing

[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:50.560]
They're terrified they're confused. They just they're either going so slow that they're not even moving or they're going so fast

[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.660]
That they don't they have no control or just laws

[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:58.020]
They just put it the accelerate of the floor and pray okay and and hold on real tight to the wheel too

[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:03.440]
And basically that's what you got. I mean and I'll grant you young guys

[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.400]
Speed no question about it. They want to drive fast a lot of them are drinking like crazy

[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.860]
They're doing drugs and stuff like that. They're out there having a good time many bad dangerous drivers

[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.500]
But in terms of handling a car being able to drive tell me that young women drive better than young men

[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.340]
You're full of crap and of a discussion. I think go that's the debate

[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.960]
1027. Let's go to Halendale. Hello. Hey Neil. How you doing? Okay, listen? I haven't seen godfather three yet because

[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:34.140]
I haven't seen two and I've been going to blockbusters to rent it and forget it because it's not available

[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.780]
But don't you have don't you have cable? I have cable, but I missed it when it was on HBO

[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:44.520]
Oh boy, but I mean it was on everywhere godfather one and two the week before this thing came on

[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.840]
They were just just drowning you with it just to get everybody prepared just to exploit it

[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:54.500]
I've seen one I put the good news is I got a friend of mine. He drives a truck for public Greg Blazingen

[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.680]
He's gonna let me he has both on tape and he's bringing them to work today

[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.360]
So I'm gonna watch a bolt tonight

[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:07.320]
Both yeah both us because I want to buy it it was a 1974 when I watch part one. I need to brush up on it. Yeah

[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:13.160]
So luckily he's got both copies and he told me that if I lose the copies

[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.640]
I'm gonna be swimming with the fishes though

[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.800]
No, it's Luca Bratsu. Yeah, I'm gonna take care of the fishes

[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.100]
Well, that's all right if you notice and godfather three in the aquarium

[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.140]
There's only one big

[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.780]
gigantic puffed up goldfish in here looks kind of like Maria's Mary's nose. Yeah, and that's it

[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.760]
So there's plenty of room in the tank. Yeah, listen. I got a question for you because I'm curious

[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.960]
I used to go to pop an old part all the time and

[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.780]
They've got quarter horse racing out there. Yeah. What happened to that allegedly it's coming back

[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.800]
This summer or something. I hope not. I hope it never comes back. You don't like quarter horse

[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.900]
Oh, I mean they run like from where I'm sitting to the wall here. It's just ridiculous

[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.060]
The only thing I don't like about they come out of a gate and they bump into each other and knock each other down

[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.920]
And it just I don't I can't handle it

[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:01.700]
Well, the only thing I don't like about it is I don't know if I want to not till the photo comes out because usually all ten or

[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.580]
Exactly. Yeah, they're running like three feet. Yeah, so you don't you can't tell if you want or not and you can't bump

[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:12.220]
At least you got a chance anyway. Yeah, now you said your next road is that calder? Well, I wouldn't get that

[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.820]
Well, that's what we've been saying all along

[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.600]
But now today we find that there are a few glitches. We're trying to get that ironed out find out exactly what we're gonna be doing there

[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.500]
Which of course are our

[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:25.040]
People never get these things straight now to head at time, but we're working on it and I'll let you know

[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.580]
Yeah, hey listen before we hang up. I want to call my Canadian next door a douchebag because they stole my mind me

[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.340]
Harold this morning. Okay, so

[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:36.280]
There's a douchebag our label douchebag. See you pal. Okay. Thanks. Lot Neil 1029

[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:42.320]
At W I O D also today aren't they drawing drawing today at Pompano Park for Sunday

[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.200]
Let's see. It's Thursday Friday, Saturday Sunday

[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:49.340]
So I should be able to tell you by the end of the day today whether Christmas list is gonna be running this weekend

[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:55.300]
That's our W I of these stable horse at Pompano has been doing very well. He's raised three times got two wins in a second

[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.880]
Under our ownership and under Bill phase excellent handing bill of course has gone off to the metal lands where he's one of the top drivers in the country

[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.560]
And I have a feeling that Joe Pavia Jr

[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:10.500]
Who at the moment? I think Joe is a leading a presented driver at Pompano is gonna be driving Christmas list

[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:16.880]
We'll see. Okay. It's 10 30. Let's go to Evan Tura. Hello. Hi Neil. Hi. I was listening to

[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:23.600]
American such yesterday and this came full of love and then I was worth a traffic and they were talking about Johnny Depp

[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:30.460]
And how they saw him on a cineo show and how the wooden and awful and he was this and that what yeah Johnny

[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.880]
Depp is wouldn't well

[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:38.080]
He's a great guy. You had him on oh, we had him on Zeta for almost four hours one morning and the wee hours in the morning

[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.240]
He was great. He's got a great sense of humor. We had a blast and he was talking about how we slept in the car

[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:48.180]
Yeah, I mean it's not to mention how good he looks too when he gets all that see that Edward Cesar hands

[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.140]
I keep seeing the previews and everybody keeps raving about it

[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:55.040]
I don't want to see Johnny Depp with all that schmutz all over him. You know with the pretty cruiser hands

[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.620]
I want to see him like naked, you know, thank God he's not a mile

[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:04.760]
But anyway, you should really enlighten Rick and Suds because they were knocking him saying he was just that he was

[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.840]
First of all, let me ask you that where do they see him? Oh, not cinnias. Well, what does that tell you?

[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.700]
What are they doing watching our cineo?

[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.040]
Is that it? Is that a dead giveaway? No, forget about stay up late

[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.240]
But isn't that a dead giveaway anybody who watches that show? I mean needs help

[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.160]
That's a friend that guy's a lot. Hey listen

[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.540]
I don't play me for the sins of my friends. That's what the Godfather's

[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:28.300]
Okay, but you should really tell them how great he is anytime they knock Johnny Depp man

[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.700]
They're gonna they're gonna have to have me to answer for I'll tell you that right now

[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.920]
I'll send Luca Bratzie over Rick Wiley's house right now if he doesn't repent for that crap

[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:41.600]
I just wish I taped that show Johnny Depp is great. He was hysterical. Yeah, really was okay

[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.820]
Have a nice holiday you too

[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.340]
Boy Rick

[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.380]
I was speaking to Rick and Suds

[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.100]
I got a book, you know

[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.240]
We get all these stupid books in the mail from these publishers

[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.320]
It wants you to bring me off the run and the shill and give him an interview to help him sell a book

[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.120]
And I was gonna throw this out

[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.180]
But now I thought about it the name of the book is children of paradise

[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:07.540]
Successful parenting for prosperous families. So I wrote for suds on the top of it for the suds father and I'll save that for him

[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.640]
Making the big bucks right

Yeah, let me tell you Christmas Eve a drop down to the teens did you see on where was it somewhere up in New York?

[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:46.440]

They said just as the shooting started a machine gun like a par I haven't seen the movie

But they said the machine gun went off in the movie two groups started firing each other a married couple got hit in the head in the back

[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.520]
You can't even go to the show on Christmas day

[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.440]
Pretty rough, huh? That's new you look yeah, well, you know why they're all down here, sir

Of course we got the orange bowl coming up on New Year's we got Notre Dame in Colorado

[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:31.980]
And I see a lot of people hope Colorado loses for a variety of reasons first of all the fact that they stole that game with that

[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:37.360]
Bogus so with that extra fifth down I don't care because I mean college sports is so corrupt anyway

[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:43.840]
What differences to make if you win with it? You know was they didn't do it the official screwed up so they took it and wouldn't anybody else you bet

[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:49.440]
So work I'm gonna be rooting so hard against Notre Dame in fact if any of the Notre Dame people are in town

Lou Holt's is here in all the Notre Dame fans from South Bend and I want to tell you this

Good luck to you. What an ugly class too, by the way, man

[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:56.180]
Well, he was class. Is he in here or he would he might be well. Let's look up for Andy Garcia

[00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:00.180]
Who's now a big star? We're making him a lot of money on this show. I'll tell you that

[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.920]
Okay, so he was like a junior right here's the junior class

[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.540]
He's not in the picture why not?

[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:16.060]

[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:30.460]
at W.I.O.D. Andy Garcia of course who was in the unmentioned but we're not talking about that today because we don't want to get the big hot new staff over there upset

[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.600]
Because it's turbo

[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.780]
It's terminal. Let's talk about how big it is

[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.500]
My plug and a core and I would say okay

[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.820]
Some people just don't measure up

[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.920]
Take it from somebody who knows okay

[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.840]
Somebody has learned the hard way okay. We have an open line in the star line star. I would deal

[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.480]
Let's try Fort Lauderdale. Hi Neil. How you doing?

[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.320]
Pretty good.

[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:00.380]
For Steve goes remember what you said is the battle with a bunch of those

[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:06.480]
All potato. Yeah in every respect not only potatoes, but I never forget that day that

He came in remember I told you that story about how you did the challenge thing and who'll take the most clothes off

[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.680]
And he made sure he got the card so he could the

[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:18.000]
Strip down naked with everybody in the room and I'm gonna tell you I mean a corn would be a compliment

[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.760]
Another thing is don't forget about Jamie Jamie. Why do you do this?

[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.260]

[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.560]

[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.940]
Okay checks in the mail. We have an open line in Brad boy that dead line really that bugs me because you know

[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:08.780]
How I am with a phone and that like effectively blocks out one desperate person every moment who wants to be unbroward

[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.440]
Although there isn't open line there now. I mean, huh? There's not

[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.340]
655 W. I. O. D. and Palm Beach where Mike Miller rules of course on the big 1230

Like I said, there's an open line in Dave County 751 and look at fat rich

[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:00.940]
Just happened a lot all in here too. Isn't that great? It's payday. We need rich to go get my check to make an offer

[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:06.500]
They can't refuse down in the counting and of course it just happened by coincidence that Wayne Arnold is on a way with just

[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:12.100]
Tons and tons and gods of fattening food, but we know that's not why riches here. It's so Thursday

[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.940]
We got a whole new team. Yeah, a lot of the only other thing I wanted to remember the first

[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:59.480]
I know you weren't gonna talk like the Godfather, but I have to I just can't remember one part

[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.460]
Well, I don't want to get Steve upset because I was gonna get a forward life

[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:08.260]
But we're gonna entertain him maybe while he thought it was terminal and of course it really hurt me

[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.920]
It wounded me to the quick. I would couldn't find it. I was like can or tank

[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.020]
Who Steve can or Steve King same difference?

[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:20.660]

[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.420]

[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.180]
Just the cheeks and the lips that's all I need

[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.420]
Yeah, we got your lips right here pal. Get him off of their real fans

[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:51.700]
I can't believe it and you know something that he's serious. That's the sad part

[00:35:53.940 --> 00:36:02.060]
Wow, I mean I've seen ugly before but she and when that brought on the CBS morning news said the yesterday morning that she was a lovely

[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.480]
Italian girl

[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:10.920]
Oh, man, even the pope was throwing canolies around he was having a fit when he heard that just before he had his evening tea

[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.180]
But uh man, can you believe that?

[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.700]

They got tons of orange juice and he did Brian's been hanging out there. They got tons and tons of orange juice

[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.400]
If you start going into like a little a hypoglycemic attack no problem to bring out like trays 50 but there we go again, see

[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.260]
Talking about that movie again. We sure don't want to bore those folks over there with their exciting

[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.280]
penis envy or whatever they do

[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:37.680]

[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:44.080]
Maybe Steve can come over here and measure it up against this canola no chance. I think you're already beaten pal

[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.620]
I know I am

[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.520]
Although that don't take much. Anyway, it's 1059. We have an open line in uh, Brown

[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:55.200]
We're really doing it today. What surprises me because we're in limbo and we admit it. We're just um

[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.660]
We're just killing time

[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.460]
Till nice Wednesday till love the second of January

[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:04.420]
Then we get serious and really start to screwing around

[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:10.880]
Okay, speaking of that the one the only the lovely Chuck Meyer is standing by with the 11 o'clock W.io. D. News

[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:14.780]
Then we'll come back at 11 o'clock and see what more damage we can do

[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:18.660]
Dan Glance vice president of sbk records

Now is that on a rotor harness reason? Well, uh, be far would be very upset. We got a big problem out there on 95 right now. Yeah

[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.420]
I don't know if you notice with a

[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.440]
Blockbuster ball is the omega-mood sisters from

[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.320]
FSU are down in math. Ooh

[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.280]
tragic out there

[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:49.800]
Put them together with the french canadians. Yeah, although the french canadians you wouldn't say there are any girls

[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:56.420]
Because even the women are all the french canadians over a hundred they won't let them out. They won't give them a visa unless they're over a hundred to get out

[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:57.480]
Yeah

[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:01.460]
Chronic sand yes, she called you she called yesterday

[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:07.740]
That she called today yet. I could picture her. Yeah, I was checking on that. I could picture her riding down the

[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.580]
Highway with her phone

[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:15.920]
In one ear and putting on a mask error with the other she don't call from a car phone. I don't think it doesn't

[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.980]
That's the not landing lady. Oh, okay

[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:24.440]
Get your player straightened out sir. Get your scorecard all us straightened out

[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:31.440]
Have a great one. Okay, he's the lost 1108 at WIOD. We have an open line on the Palm Beach line

[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:36.820]
Oh, he was on the Palm Beach line that explains it 655 9463 the canolies were great

[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:40.800]
See I didn't get that right away in the card. It said what I do with the card very cute

[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.820]
I feel a little like Eli Wallach it said from Sophia and Eli

[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.940]
Meaning Eli Wallach and Sophia

[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.100]
Coppola

[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:57.700]
But you have to see the movie because you have to see the scene where Eli Wallach is watching the opera eating the canolies

[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.040]
Which I think is kind of a tacky to be honest with it

[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:06.280]
But he was basically a tacky guy and for exacting he deserved everything he got man. He was putrid

[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:07.300]
Kendall

[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.200]

If that was stand was on this station that's screwed over. You got screwed over battery on what is it?

[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:41.880]

Standing out on the air you keep asking me that I keep trying to tell you and you keep ramble like on and on and on

When you listen put a put a lid on it for just a second or send Bernie gets to your house. Okay, just relax

[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:13.500]
Stan was on this station when came left here and went to New York, which you know how that wound up

[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:18.940]
Stan was on here and they gave him about like two months and no chance at all then they put him on at night

[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:26.240]
And they did the same thing and they put all these ball games on and then they brought in this douchebag Randy Martin and put her on and it's all history stands on the beach

[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.020]
All right, thanks for the program and get knocked it up

[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:31.500]

[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:44.180]

[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.460]
You have some good good cards. Stan had some good cards

[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.620]

[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.220]
I had a feeling it was going to be this way from the beginning and probably if we lucked out it would have been

[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:08.600]
And then we did just played all those great cards that this guy's talking about and I'd have to continue with people

[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:12.260]
Try to pretend they have something to say who really don't it's 11 22

[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:14.640]

[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:20.100]
He knows a little nutty

[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:22.680]
He knows a little really

[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:28.760]

[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:17.000]
Is in that and there's Alice look at her boy. She looks like she's ready to float away any second and surely

[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:23.260]
Surely tweeters who's changed their name and doing more of that pseudo intellectual garbage that she's famous for Barbara's

[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:27.480]
Studley. Oh, I just love the Jewish people. Do I just love them to this and

[00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:34.280]
Whichner look at that look at that plus he must have been about 90 and that picture that was taken 10 years ago

[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:39.740]
Look at that wig man. It's like sharp truce in this picture and it's in black and white, but you can tell

[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.240]
Wow

[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:50.860]
Arbitron just rated W. News day and browards leading AM station boil how the mighty have fallen huh? What was your on this

[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.720]
January 24th, 1983

That fortunately was my last year at W.S. News boy some of us know when to get the halada

[00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:02.020]
Look at that picture

[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:08.900]
There's only one superstar and South Florida talk radio. He's dynamic eloquent and controversial his name

[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:16.720]
Neal Rogers his program the highest rated in the market no one can match Neil what it comes to explaining the pros and cons of an issue

[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:20.940]
And no one can match Neal's ability to bring listeners to their feet

[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:24.580]
Whether they agree with what he says or are outraged by his comments

[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:28.260]
Neal Rogers with 15 years of talk radio experience unmatched by any other

[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:33.660]
Sound Florida talkmaster. How do you like that? Here? Neal excited audience Monday through Friday 8 p.m.

[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:38.740]
The midnight Sundays from 10 to 2 and it works six days and knows you in those years in those days

[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:40.960]
What a pile of crap

[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:46.660]
For peanuts, too. Let's do the mobile in pop and oh hello. Yes, the yeah

[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:51.540]
The Godfather of course Godfather 3 do you think that it's skipped around too much?

[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:56.180]
No, they all skipped around how about Godfather 2 that skipped all over the place

[00:51:56.180 --> 00:52:03.600]
Yeah, but this one here especially at the very end at the very very end. Yeah, well, that's obviously

[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.140]
You know sometime later like about 10 minutes later

[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:10.420]
Yeah, but you now that that goes very far forward from the time that

[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:16.960]
That we last are there and this way on the steps and then we go to that last this last scene right?

[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:25.120]
Well now what do you think they moved forward 20 years probably right well maybe five or ten and and we are to conclude or did you conclude that that was

[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:26.700]
That was Michael

[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:33.820]
You mean there's a question about it? Of course it was in well. Yeah, but and do we conclude that he died at that point?

[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:35.560]
Oh, sir

[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:43.000]
I'm begging you go back and see it again. I will yesterday. I waited until until you gave the review and then yesterday

[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.560]
I go I walk right in and I'm like the third guy in the place

[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:46.420]
I mean, you know

[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:51.880]
I missed a lot of things in there too that were very obvious that I'm embarrassed about but I mean you got to go back and see it again

[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:56.520]
Of course it's in that's it. That's the end. What does that got to do with the rest of the story?

[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:58.940]
Did it show that he died as a

[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:04.020]
A poor man or that he just said everything even though he got a mowl Larry and all these wonderful things happened

[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:07.000]
Everything he was without his daughter. He was desperate and he just died

[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:11.180]
He was like a vegetable. I mean here. He was sick to begin with don't you understand?

[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:15.260]
It looked like he was in like some kind of a home or something somewhere like who knows where he was

[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:20.060]
Is like out out on the ranch, you know and it was it? Well, that was just the love at home

[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:26.760]
That's what that place right that's what I'm saying. He was just like you know a vegetable veggie from Boko

[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:34.140]
Well, it's go see it again. I'm telling five five. Oh, definitely, but five fire was it was it was great all the way through

[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:38.820]
Well, it was a strange ending. I'll grant you that and now that we've ruined it for everybody listening

[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:42.320]
Are they'll still go out and say no they don't understand they don't have exactly

[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:47.740]
They say yeah, I mean there's still everybody that's listening just like myself and probably you are gonna have to go back

[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:50.340]
And they're just to make sure that we solve the stuff that we really

[00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:53.380]
Well, not only that we've got to make sure that Francis gets enough might to get the

[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.960]
Plastic surgery for Sophia really that

[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:01.860]
Now did you hear the guy who called in earlier and said that she was a 10 on a scale of 10

[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:07.560]
I think it was Ray Charles I could call you wrong

[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:13.500]
He goes from the Stevie Wonder School of a meal that movie appreciate no question. We'll go see it again and let me know

[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.900]
I will okay. Thank you. Wow. I thought I was confused

[00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:21.300]
Maybe it was uh, maybe that was Connie at the end with a bad hairdo

[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:29.440]
It's 1130 we have an open line on the sterline. It's star. I'm confused star i.o. D

[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:33.100]
How does the food coming by the way, huh? And look at that just as see

[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:38.060]
I always know to come up with that line and every time I say it I see Murray in the hallway man

[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.200]
It works like magic. It has never failed

[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:44.340]
Every time I say how's the food coming when and Murray come right around the corner

[00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:47.920]
With two gigantic boxes of stuff

[00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:49.880]
Look at that

[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:54.940]
Now what's the rich gonna eat that's all for me isn't it? I'm just in a eating mood today

[00:54:54.940 --> 00:55:00.280]
I'll tell you I would eat almost anything and we got look at the beautiful canola's that's uh, they brought us by today

[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:02.180]
Look at those anthos great

[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.960]
Murray looks like he'd like one. Do you want one of those?

[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:06.200]
Huh?

[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.860]
Did you see the movie? Oh, you did see the movie how'd you like it

[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:15.940]
And Wayne loved it and if Wayne are to like did you uh better say you like that he's gonna cut off your um white hot

[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:20.040]
Okay, let's go to a Miami. Hello, hey Neil. Hey doing okay

[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:22.740]
It's my report from Alice Randell

[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:25.200]
He was on speech show yesterday

[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:27.740]
Effectively he said that

[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:32.880]
He is the longest in a way you get personal help and make these

[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:37.460]
Costic attacks at him he says that if he if you do he is going to

[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:38.720]
Let me quote

[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:43.140]
The O Roger out of the uh bad. Oh boy

[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:50.420]
I'm terrified. I can uh, yeah, I was really terrified for you. Yeah, I mean, I'm what a whim, you know

[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:55.640]
Yeah, you just can't take it. No, I can't and that's what I did not already say that before that

[00:55:55.640 --> 00:56:00.560]
He just can't play the game that he's so so childish about it and takes everything so uh personal

[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:06.760]
Speaking of childhood like Michael said it's business and this man is taken at personal. I play a sonny said that

[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.660]
I plan on seeing the movie tonight. Yeah also

[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.140]
Spy report from store or cable

[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:15.980]
Rumor has it that they are real close to sighting with sports channel

[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:23.720]
However, I'm not holding my breath from a store. Well, I would be great wouldn't it? It would be but um again

[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:28.720]
I am not holding my breath and you know until I actually turn on the tv said and I see sports channel

[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:33.140]
I ain't gonna believe it. Yeah, actually I heard also that um how about continental

[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.780]
That's there's separate entity and you're gonna have to deal with continental

[00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:40.340]
Forget it. No chance. The worst the absolute worst

[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:44.880]
You're better luck without continental cable is worse than southern bail and that's sandaline

[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.940]
Well, I don't know if there's any worse in store

[00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:53.480]
Okay, thanks. Well, I guess I've been putting my place here. Thanks for the message. No problem. The uh

[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:59.520]
It's 1133 how we make it out on that big business deal. It's under consideration. I tell him to consider

[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.340]

[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:42.340]
Well, does this include the 320?

[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:51.980]
Well, no, I think it was there one in here for 300 or where I'm imagining things there was so that includes it

[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:56.640]
Are we getting a little disorganized here or what?

[00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:58.140]
Yeah, it's in there

[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:00.860]
Well, no, that's from

From the other guys that separate from this or did she give him the check find out because I don't want to screw up the whole total

[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:20.440]
Okay, we're trying to do this early legitimate

[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:23.860]

Well, what the hell is that is that this 300?

[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:47.260]
So that includes it all right. That's our total as of right now

97 and 93,000 that is in there 93,000 say here please take these because riches screw us all up

[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:57.980]

[00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:03.120]
But we're trying to do things organized and he comes in here all he wants to do is just open up the mail so we can read all the notes and read my mail

[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.700]

[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:25.220]
The point to talk about two things

[00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:30.320]
You don't leave one for no in there. You're gonna get your hands back to city that you can have one did George take one

[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:31.980]
No, take one

[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:37.440]
Yeah, take one. There's three of them in there take one don't argue with me take it Wendy cut the crap

[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:41.400]
Yeah, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Okay. I heard a lot yesterday about

[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:46.180]
Goodfellas that you had finally think changed your mind about well. I haven't changed my mind about anything

[00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:49.720]
I just didn't know what it was okay. Yeah, it's a great what's a great film

[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:55.540]
That all of anybody told you it is still playing in local theaters really it's playing up in bokeh the shadow with 12

[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:59.660]
Well, I'm not gonna bokeh to see good for us. Well, you know, it's worth it. It's worth the trip

[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:00.760]
I think it's a really good movie

[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:06.260]
But another thing that bothered me yesterday got about the right before the 11 o'clock hour called in and complained about

[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:09.820]
Frato's acting in the first two films. Oh, what an idiot. I know absolutely

[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:12.400]
John Cassali's an excellent actor was and

[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:16.460]
He said I think he made he made a comment about well. You hadn't seen him in anything since

[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:21.600]
Well, of course John Cassali was married to Merrill Streep in the early 70s and he died of cancer, right?

[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:24.780]
It's somebody mentioned that yesterday. I didn't hear that. I'm sorry. I didn't hear that

[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.700]
Anyway, you don't take a chance and go see goodfellas up at in bokeh

[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:32.180]
It's really worth going to see in a big screen. I think it's only in bokeh

[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:35.080]
Well, it's the only place I thought I was looking for it for you in the in the papers

[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.960]
And I couldn't find any other place with the shadow wood

[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:41.880]
But that's a pretty good mall cinema. They have one 70 millimeters screen. I don't have to stay in show on that particular

[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:45.840]
Where is it? It's right the corner of blades and 441

[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.540]
Hmm, let's go ways up there. I can go up to sawgrass

[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:52.140]
Yeah, you can go up the sawgrass and go straight up 441

[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:57.100]
And then it's right off. It's round the northeast corner. Okay, so there's worth it

[01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.620]
How are you? I'm Neil. Thanks. You too. Bye-bye

[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.980]
1143 W.I.D. We have a note. Now is the horse running Sunday?

[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.320]
How come I don't have is it in here?

[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:11.360]
Sometimes I feel

[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:19.620]
I don't see it. Oh, yeah Sunday night Christmas list

Let's get that information over here. Alan. Let's get on a stick over there at Pompano Park and get that stuff over here

[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.340]
They do this morning at 9 or 10 o'clock

[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:35.100]
And we're sitting here with a piece of crappy copy from Southland advertising in our hand. Okay?

[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:37.280]
Get that draw over here

[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.900]
You know this time of the year is frustrating because everybody's like in a fog

[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:45.020]
They don't want to do anything. They're like on some kind of a damn busman's holiday

[01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:48.700]
Wonder who stole that TV by the way from our newsroom

[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.980]
It's 1144 at W.I.O.D

[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:57.760]
We have an open line in Brown County get 45 guesses in the first 44 don't come by the way

[01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.260]
Can I borrow your car after lunch George?

[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:03.520]
Paul Harvey Jr. Hey, how you doing? I can't believe it

[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.040]
Listen, you remember when you were

[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:11.580]
Used to push her back remember what when you were a kid now. I can't remember that long and you used to push your face up against the window

[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:18.160]
Pain and distort it and get it all smushy. Oh like last week. That's Sophia. I was looking in my neighbor's window

[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:26.320]
That's Sophia anybody that thinks she is beautiful. Oh, I heard that caller. Oh, his guys are just putting us on

[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:33.120]
I'll tell you what nobody's that stupid there was a couple problems. I had with the movie and and tell me if you agree or not

[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.180]
with the casting

[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:41.780]
Okay, you had Sophia you had Eli right you've your Hamilton there were three bad bad numbers

[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:43.960]
Who was the other one George Hamilton the fourth

[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:49.660]
And then there was another one there was one other one the guy that plays father are Guido Sarducci

[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:56.180]
You know the character father are Guido Sarducci. Yeah, you know comedy. He was in the movie the archbishop

[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:59.800]
No, no, no, no, no, he was he was a minor character. He had probably

[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:05.640]
Five minutes he was really in it. He was in it. No get out of here. You're crazy

[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:10.540]
No, there are a couple things you miss and that was one. Okay, whatever you see was not in it as father are Guido

[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:14.420]
He was in it as another anybody with an orange head, you know, you got to listen to what this man

[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:18.820]
No, no, no, he with that guy with the that guy was that actor was in the movie

[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:21.400]
Okay, he sounded exactly like you did his father are

[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:27.080]
Yeah, when you see it again, you'll pick it up. All right, okay, and the other thing too that I'm surprised nobody's anything about

[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:30.940]
What was the dumb the retired dominant sister leave that everybody loved?

[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.820]
Don Thomas, you know, Thomas, you know that he was one of a shot in the car right?

[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.140]
Well, didn't anybody pick it up that at the end?

[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:42.220]
Michael looked exactly like him wearing the same sweater

[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:44.980]
Now he didn't look maybe a hundred pounds less

[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:51.300]
He looked a lot like no, he did not he was wearing that time. I see no had a big snows almost like Sophia

[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:54.740]
What the hell movie did you see we talked to me those are Ducci and

[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:58.440]
Oh, wait, are we talking about the guy? I want to see laughing

[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.660]
He's gonna be doing already Johnson jokes the guy that was shot in the car

[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:07.240]
Don Thomas, you know, nothing like Michael Corleone

[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:12.360]
Well, Michael was a shriveled up a little gray-haired man and with the sunglasses and

[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:19.040]
It looked nothing like that time. I see no was a big fat blob of a guy who looked like I don't want to see

[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.320]
Well anyway, he looked up to him

[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.300]
He said that everybody loved him in Sicily. He wanted to be like that. He wanted to be loved

[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.620]
Right and at the end he's wearing that same khaki

[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:33.400]
No, you're just let me say something you you're from the Bill Cosworth School of movie watching

[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:39.120]
You're trying to intellectualize and read all these things and just watch it and absorb it and enjoy it

[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:43.180]
See it again a second time and pick up the things that you miss but don't try to read all the

[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:47.520]
Cable as an airy-dave you'll be finding symbolism on Sophia's nose for fun

[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:53.080]
All out a micro-emother was really pissed off. She's never seen conoles with candy to apricots on the end

[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:59.920]
That really pissed her off. You notice that's all Connie did was just suck on the apricot

[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.880]
Yes, you need to know he no dummy

[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:08.360]
He knew too. You notice he knew yeah, he knew he said here. You're so skinny. You have some first okay?

[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:13.060]
I think you like lick like a little thing off the end of a dinner all of the dinner mouth

[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:15.540]
I don't think so. I don't know about that. How about the granoli?

[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:22.260]
I think that's why she was so surly how much mercury you think Sophia has in her mouth

[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:26.620]
Good day good day 1147 and W. I. O. D

[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:47.620]
In Broward

[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:52.220]
Miami, oh Neil. Yes, sir. This is the godfather in Tensis station now

[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:55.600]
We don't talk about things that are terminal. We're talking about how long it is listen

[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.200]
I haven't seen the movie let me ask you a question

[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:03.940]
Excuse me. What happened to Michael's two children Anthony and the little girl did they tell about that movie?

[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:06.960]
What even what happened to that's what we're talking about sir. Have you been

[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:14.840]
What's going on with you kid? That's who it is Maria. I mean Mary Corleone is the daughter that Sophia Coppola

[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.880]
Coppola whatever the hell his name is and

[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:20.820]
Anthony is the opera singer. They're like the center

[01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:24.680]
I thought that Mary was Mary the one that was it was baptized

[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:28.340]
Right, okay. I thought that was Connie's daughter

[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:34.560]
That was Connie's baby. Don't you remember he was like he said I can't kill you suddenly because I mean

[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:38.000]
Clara because I'm the godfather your baby. I can't kill your husband

[01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:42.200]
You're missing the point. She has the baby

[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:48.700]
Sophia Corleone was Connie's daughter. Okay. She got baptized in the church while he was doing mobile

[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:54.340]
I'm the other guy. Yeah, okay, but in this movie she plays Mary Corleone, which is his daughter. Oh, okay

[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:58.140]
I didn't know we don't know Connie kids have gone off to Long Island somewhere

[01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:01.660]
We don't know where the hell they are either in the fur business or so. I don't know what the hell they're doing

[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:07.040]
They're not in it. Okay, they're gone. Okay. I didn't know nothing about them. I thought that Sophia was was

[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:11.460]
Still a Connie's daughter. No, I said they changed Michael wishes that but

[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:17.140]
Believe me when you see her I'm gonna tell you I think that the previews of stuff

[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:18.960]
I haven't seen the movie but when you see the movie

[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:22.660]
I mean the previews are nothing but when you really get a look at that push up close

[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:28.540]
And when you exactly when you think about these guys who've been calling in these real

[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:31.900]
I mean you talk about destiny about how she's a 10 on a scale

[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:36.460]
She may be a 10 on a scale of four billion, but that's about as good as I'm gonna give her okay

[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:41.260]
I mean she has if there's an uglier person in Italy than her. I haven't seen it. Okay unbelievable

[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:45.900]
She I mean even Don Tomasino was a beauty compared to her. I mean she is grotesque

[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:50.820]
Well, I was the guy that called on the other day and charge a Richard Conte's name right. Thank you

[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:52.400]
She's one other thing

[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.360]
I also just found out that good fellows is playing in

[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:02.880]

[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:44.380]

[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.620]
We need drooping two if you're still running at that age

You let them do it. We're gonna beat you with a two by four rich

[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.660]
See some people in the beginning they're okay and then they start pushing too much

[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:26.880]
And that was a nice family at that one-speccer mode. They were okay

[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:31.720]
We had some fun with them and all of a sudden the two little bratty study a former met now pirate fan kids

Now if you put the two of them together and you like

W.I. Day we would have

[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:36.740]
An open line in Broward that we'd invite you to call on but unfortunately it's broke

[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:38.400]
Miami

[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:46.100]
Neil yes sir. I saw the movie on Wednesday and I thought it was great. Well thank god for a man with good taste

[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:50.460]
It wasn't as good as the first two like you've been saying but I think it was a good movie right

[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:55.180]
One thing you had a caller a little while ago that mentioned that father

[01:13:55.620 --> 01:14:01.000]
Guitarsard Dutche was in the movie. Yeah, I think he was. Are you cereal? Yeah, how could I miss that?

[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:02.660]
Well, he wasn't wearing his

[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:06.820]
Garb you know he didn't have the glasses and he didn't have the mustache

[01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:10.840]
He was the guy dressed in a dark suit that introduced

[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.860]
Michael's daughter when they were presenting the $100 million check. Oh

[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:20.600]
We're early in the movie right right. He was like the master of ceremony. I'll be dead

[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:24.500]
Well, see if Sophia was in the scene. I probably wasn't I was trying to look the other way

[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:30.020]
Yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah, wait the fellow that called yesterday don't spend it all in one place

[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:34.100]
He didn't say that she was erotic. He said he read it

[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:34.840]
exotic

[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:38.200]
exotic yeah, you had a caller

[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:40.720]
yesterday morning before the noon hour

[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:47.060]
And he said that she was exotic. Yeah, she's about as exotic as a lizard and Okachobi

[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:49.100]
Well, you know, that's pretty subjective

[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:54.840]
I don't listen. It usually is but in her case, I don't think there's much room for argument

[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:57.520]
Yeah, she is a pretty bad actor

[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:03.860]
Hmm, if you can call her that she may not look good, but she sure can't act that's right. Well, she's got an influential father

[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:04.920]
Where there you go

[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:08.820]
One final note when Connie a dad's

[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:15.500]
Kazoli a little bit that's a Zoli Kazoli is pizza canola canola. Sorry about that. How come she didn't get poisoned

[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:20.220]
Which she just had a little bit he just like gave a little a tongue on the end of the thing there

[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:23.740]
That's all she did. Yeah, maybe couldn't you tell her well. Yeah, but I mean

[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:26.220]
What was he thinking about if he thought she ate some of it?

[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:31.860]
He must he was hungry. What can I tell you yeah, he had a reacting like he did you'd have been hungry too? He ate the whole box

[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.480]
Yeah, well, it was a good way to go anyway, wasn't it? Yeah, it was it was great

[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:41.940]
I just like I'm gonna do here. I think one more these will put me in the same condition. Okay. I'm out of material name

[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:42.560]

[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:15.380]
Who the hell knows and obviously nobody cares either

[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:21.280]
What open line in date 751 2 and Broward 524 w i o d and well now this time

[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:28.800]
I'm telling you Marvin is on vacation for two weeks and this man is just filling in the breach

[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:34.260]
He has been on that phone endlessly since I sat down here at 10 o'clock last time I go to take a break

[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:40.220]
He's like don't bother me. I'm busy with Marvin's calls over here. Okay. Let's do a break and we'll be right back

[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:44.560]
He never have two or words been spoken then I'm dying over here

[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:48.360]
Wow, at one point during the break we were down to like one call now we got three

[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:53.120]
But that's certainly not didn't I tell you we should have just played the rank today and I come through this mindless exercise

[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:57.280]
Today tomorrow and Monday hopeless. This is a limbo time

[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:04.860]
Miami Beach Neil. Yeah, I got something here. I think we should talk about here. Okay

[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:09.100]
Uh, then we poured in a sleazy paper and down Miami

[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:12.300]
The organized crime is um

[01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:15.560]
Link to uh, there's no such thing as organized

[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:22.720]
No, said thing is the mafia the mob organized crime. It's all a figment of the county pinkal media

[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:26.860]
It is imagination. Not such thing as a mafia. No such thing

[01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:32.920]
But at any rate they got to school buses in New York and uh

[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:38.380]
The contractors and law enforcement officials uh, they've told the times no less

[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.320]
That union influence

[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:46.420]
By suspected organized crime figures control the cost of hiring practices that many

[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:55.360]
Of the bus companies employed by the city yeah one company that transports disabled children and Brooklyn

[01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:01.460]
Was run by a mafia hitman. I can't believe they report this past

[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:06.540]
Yeah, they were putting olive oil in the crankcase. I couldn't believe it. Yeah, it's just uh, you know, it's unbelievable

[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:10.620]
This kind of stuff is uh, it gives a bad name to

[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:18.920]
The good time people know what I mean. Yeah, should be put to start too. Okay, Vito. Okay. See it. Kazoolyse

[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.940]
Call 16 at W.Y. O.D. Now we got two calls on that board out at this point

[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:28.280]
I think it'd be a good time to start playing the cards. I mean you people are just hopeless today hopeless

[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:40.300]
You

[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:46.080]
Well see the reason to cut the women stop the music stop the reason I got disconnected is because I answered it because you're in a fog

[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:51.500]
You're like you should be in London. Okay. You should be like in London W.Y. O.D. Georgia's Dazing

[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:52.480]
Dozing

[01:19:53.700 --> 01:20:01.020]
I want to speak to me. Oh, hold on W.Y. O.D. Georgia's on vacation. We are worried about hold on W.Y. O.D.

[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:02.860]
Hello

[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:11.600]
Okay, up yours. Okay. Now what was it? Dale. Yeah, uh listen in the movie on a credit at the end. It said Nicholas Cage

[01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:18.160]
Was he in that movie? I mean, I thought a picture. I don't remember seeing Nicholas Cage. Nicholas Cage. Who the hell is that?

[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:20.860]
You know, it's the guy to play uh

[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:25.560]
Peggy Sue and pay in that play in uh in Arizona

[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:25.900]
uh

[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.540]
Well if he was in Peggy Sue that was um

[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:37.340]
That was their husband, huh? Yeah, it was Nicholas Cage. Yeah, but that was Francis Ford's movie wasn't it Peggy Sue got married? Yeah, right

[01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:41.240]
Yeah, so he's don't you understand the guys in a nepotism? I mean a guy probably

[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:46.540]
He probably he probably brought the canolies or something

[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:48.760]
He just walked maybe to walk through

[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:55.400]
Uh, yeah, for that. Yo, God damn it. Listen if anybody calls and wants to know what these types

[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:59.440]
Yeah, just look it up in the dictionary. You'll see her picture now. See her picture

[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:02.520]
That's all I got this day. Me as would be a compliment for

[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:03.940]
Have a great life

[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:09.440]
1217 and wio. They mean you know like the guy said before a lot of things are subjective

[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:12.640]
You can think somebody is beautiful somebody else's there ugly somebody uh

[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:19.300]
But in her case, there's no room for debate. Okay, it's a closed argument believe me

[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:22.140]
It's an open-and-shut case and I think they should have it on her face

[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:24.480]
Miami, how you doing now great

[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.220]
Damn she is ugly. Oh

[01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:31.900]
John us nose the size of the state of Delaware in fact it looks a little shaped like Delaware

[01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:35.940]
She fell off the ugly tree and had every branch on the way when your nose is big enough

[01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:41.200]
It can be broken in 17 different places. That's incredible. You know you're talking and are we facing between

[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:47.340]
Can we talk baseball for a sec? We can talk about whatever the how you people want because we're in La La Lancer

[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:51.780]
This is strictly an exercise. I've heard you mentioned Georgia Bell a lot if you haven't mentioned

[01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:56.540]
You guys acquired Dave Smith and Danny Jackson Danny Jackson in a partridge in a pair of three

[01:21:56.540 --> 01:22:00.520]
How come we still got all these starters? How come we still got all these catchers though

[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:03.500]
And how come we still got that first snuck in a Jerome Walton, okay

[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:10.460]
Jerome Walton is dumb. Okay. He's got raw talent, but he's dumb. He's never gonna be a great player

[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:15.300]
He can't run the bases. He just I'll take the sends a lot there any day of the week

[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.880]
Well, I'm a mad fan. I'm sorry

[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:25.680]
Well, you ought to be sorry. Okay. We were just to discuss in Kevin but you don't glad Kevin MacGrennell just milked 10 million out of them because

[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:30.960]
Strabber he's gone. I'm coming back for three more excruciating years of pain. I'm glad

[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:33.800]
Because Kevin goes to these very brief

[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:41.420]
Here's great these brief streets where he just hot as a pistol and then in the clutch he chokes. So you know that's Kevin

[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:44.560]
But I'm glad I'm glad Strabber is gone very simple. Well, you should be

[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:50.520]
temperamental guy got a little heat. He's in low jump revocator. Oh, he does sucks darling also sucks

[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:56.280]
And you know, you got one picture on a team and that's good in the rest of malls. So by all of the trees of crap

[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:59.680]
If people swing well this year they're gonna stop swinging

[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:02.640]
I'm doing. I was the last half of the season all of a sudden they stopped swinging

[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:07.180]
He's gonna be swinging from a tree in the Bronx somewhere big, but I you know

[01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:11.460]
I like the acquisition of Huey Brooks, but I don't think Vince Coleman will win. Wait a minute. Wait a minute

[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:14.240]
Are you serious? I do like you be broke up for what?

[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:25.620]
Another troublemaker you got rid of one troublemaker got another one coming in now and he's over the hailey's an old guy and I don't think I don't think Vince Coleman will do so well on the graph. How about Ronald Coleman?

[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.200]
Who's Ronald Coleman the dead actor?

[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:32.100]
Well, I'm a young guy. I don't know about Ronald. Well, that's I'm trying to educate you

[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:34.160]
I'm gonna play Clements and now that we're going back

[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:40.940]
We've been we've been over that a million times. Name is Richard Castelliano. Oh my younger boy. He's dead. He's dead. He ate too many canolies. He's dead

[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:47.560]
Oh, that's right. We've got to leave the gun bring the gun only that's right greatest to what are greatest scenes in the history

[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:50.100]
In fact the puddle is still out there in the middle of the field out there

[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:55.900]
I'd like to know I'd like to know one thing. We're in New York. Did they find a field like that? I've been in New York a many times

[01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:58.780]
Yeah, that was the whole state

[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:06.080]
There's a toxic waste bag in the back. Well, Neil. Thanks a lot and good luck to you guys. You're gonna need it

[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:08.240]
Hey, okay, good day. Okay

[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:14.160]
20 afternoon at W.I.O.D. We're picking up a little bit of smoke not steam a little bit of smoke

[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:15.980]
It looks like they just voted in the new Pope

[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:22.500]
751 and date and 655 9463 in Palm Beach 655 W.I.O.D

[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:34.840]
For all those of you into Freddie Krueger and isn't it ironic that the first movie

[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:39.480]
I can remember Johnny Deff ever being in was Nightmare on Elmestreet part one

[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:42.900]
Right

[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:47.460]
I remember that very well where he's lying in the bed naked with the T and E.

[01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:51.640]
It got sucked through the bed and the blood was all over the wall. I got very excited during that scene

[01:24:52.460 --> 01:25:00.180]
Anyway, it's 12 foot you don't remember that? You're a man. You're at and I'd in the at too many lunches with grave line. Okay. That's your problem

[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:04.400]
Wonder what they were eating. Okay, let's go to Tamarack. Hello

[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:09.100]
Yeah, Neil. I just got on I've heard a lot of talking about how ugly this girl is in the movie

[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:15.560]
How's the overall movies it worth the 1150 movie worth what the 1150 I'm gonna have to show out to go see it

[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.200]
Why you got like a whole bunch of people you're taking with you?

[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:18.720]
It's the white

[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:24.340]
Why is it 1150? Well, at least when I go in the evening it's 575 apart

[01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:27.680]
575 what a ripoff in a daytime is three bucks

[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:30.600]
Well, that's two there worked during the day. Well, why don't you go on the weekend?

[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:32.400]
I

[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:38.060]
True listen, let me tell you something no matter what you pay. It's well worth it. It's excellent

[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:41.580]
Not forget about one and two. Okay. It's not as good as one and two

[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:45.780]
But it's very good when you leave you'll be very happy when to see it

[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:51.160]
Okay, and I heard I've heard so much about this and when that pusher hers comes on a screen just to look around you

[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:55.380]
Okay, just pretend you got like an itcha and scratch your face and just the she'll get off it real quick

[01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:57.220]
She's not about Bridget fond of her. She worth

[01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:59.880]
We're good in the movie. Oh, yeah, okay

[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:05.140]
The other thing I want to call about is um, I've just a recently moved to Florida

[01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:08.420]
I just thought I listened to your show and this thing about the Camilla's house

[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:12.520]

[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:52.460]
We're just putting the erudges on the Camilla's house or make the checkout to Camilla's house put my name on the envelope

[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:56.800]
And it'll get here but we'll stamp on it there and like magic all right

[01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:59.840]
Thank you sir. Have a great life enjoy the movie

[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:04.100]
1229 at WIOD now let's see if I played my cards right

[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:09.180]
Boy and I see if I'd have known this I wouldn't have eaten all this food today

[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:15.240]
And I will admit this that the other day I was very good not by choice but by force

[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:19.460]
I didn't eat any food at the movie because I couldn't get any the lines that the can

[01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:23.700]
I mean it didn't key little theaters there at that more said theater and they got a little

[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:28.340]
Most theaters you go in there's like a big concession stand with like I have it as some people working there

[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:33.760]
No problem, you know like four sides around this thing. I like a little rickety. Uh thing there

[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:39.880]
And you'd have to stand in line for an hour to get food. So no snow caps no milk duds no nothing

[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.000]
It was incredible

[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.920]
But if I'm gonna go see like two features. I'm gonna have to you know two three boxes of snow caps at least

[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:49.040]
So let me see how we work this out

[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:52.180]
Let's see good fellas at 430

[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:57.500]
How long the movie is that? Oh, that's a long one right is it three hours

[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:01.340]
Well, it's 115 430 and 715

[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:05.680]
Huh

[01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:12.640]
It must be well, let's see in the last one is it 10 must be like two and a half hours

[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:15.640]
Well, that's good. I don't like these short movies. It are an hour and a half

[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:20.140]
It's like it's like our records. It's like those old records in the 50s that are a minute and 40 seconds long

[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:21.200]
You're not getting your money's worth

[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.960]
So godfather three is at seven

[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:32.820]
Goodfellas is at 430 boy. Can you imagine that and godfather three will be over 10 by the time I come out of there

[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:36.620]
I'll need oxygen and better take the helium tank along because if I'm gonna see one

[01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:38.260]
I might as well go see the other one again

[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:44.580]
So we can spend two or three days more on this again next we can really get cane hysterical right is hysterical

[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:46.240]
steric

[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.480]
right conny

[01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:53.460]
1231 at w.i.o. Do we have an open line and broard 524 Miami? Hello?

[01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:58.200]
You all right today. Okay, I didn't see the movie yet. So how about goodfellas. You see that?

[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:03.720]
Didn't see that one either well. I hear it's tremendous and I'm gonna tell you something if it's not you're gonna hear about it tomorrow

[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:10.340]
Yeah, I mean these people are going on. Oh, it's great. You got to see it. It's the greatest things since sliced bread

[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:13.580]
Yeah, that's well they're saying that so I we have a new baby

[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:16.980]
So we have to wait till we get a baby sitter. Well isn't that cute. Yeah, it's okay

[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:22.280]
Yeah, maybe you can give some pointers to suds when it comes on later. Yeah, that's the truth about being a geriatric father

[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:25.120]
I'm about to add old no, I'm talking about him

[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:33.020]
Man, I don't know if there's any hope did you get your letter from the Miami hockey incorporated? No, I did not not yet

[01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:38.080]
I got by in the other day. Do you have your check in there? No, no, it's a letter that says either

[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:39.620]
They want to keep our money

[01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:45.540]
And because they want to bring either a farm team or a minor league team. Oh come on

[01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:49.440]
You know how that's gonna go over here like a pregnant pole vault around the fourth of July right?

[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.260]
Well, they're taking a

[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:55.580]
Survey for a small house and then either if they don't get that then they'll give you your money back

[01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:58.700]
I believe it's in June of 91 if they don't get anything. Yeah

[01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:03.260]
But if you get something all right my foot up their butt is what they're gonna get they keep

[01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:09.280]
$100 and the mad that god free woodman, you know something right from like the second day after the game after I gave my

[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:13.260]
Panamon ear he sounded like a real marginal douchebag to me. Yeah, I

[01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:18.220]
I just can't believe they just didn't go into it whole heart. Yeah, we could have gotten if you do realize that don't

[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:23.620]
Because everybody else was back and out of it for 50 million. They all had they were screaming like let me out of here

[01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:28.660]
Forget it. Well like you kept saying they didn't put any publicity nothing not one word

[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:29.800]
Zero

[01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:32.340]
That's right

[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:40.360]
I wonder doesn't it? Yeah, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I guess I'll let him keep my money until like when that one to five shot finishes seventh and a

[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:46.040]
Six-horse field you start scratching your head and wondering how come you never got off the rail? Yeah, well

[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:50.260]
I can't wait till tomorrow so you tell us how good fellows is know what I mean I have to go see it

[01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:54.720]
Huh, I may not have to go well. Listen. How can this many people be wrong?

[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:59.140]
I mean everybody just says it's tremendous all the critics give it a rave reviews. It's supposed to be great

[01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:03.940]
Yeah, we'll just have to wait and see I just hope back in the store remember the name of it when I come back tomorrow

[01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:08.840]
Let's you know how it is that's true. You might want to go to a drugstore pick up your own candy save a little bit of money

[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:10.320]
No, listen

[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:14.820]
Don't you understand in the movie theaters? That's where they make all their monies on concessions right?

[01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:19.420]
Well, they got to pay through the nose for those movies. Yeah, they make money on pigs like us

[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:24.060]
We'll get and these people the other day they're bringing these buckets like a tub not just a bucket

[01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:30.080]
A tub of popcorn you could take a bath in that damn thing you could put a lane editor in there and have room for the Russian army left over

[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:31.640]
Yeah incredible

[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:39.000]
All of it is kind of cute because Bob Mayor stuck his head up out of the tub give the news during the before the movie started

[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:39.580]
It was cute

[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:43.060]
Well, you have a good time this evening. Yeah, have a nice life

[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:48.720]
Well, I guess my day is all spoken for 1234 at W.I.O.D

[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:52.460]
Let's do a little pop it up boy. I should have gone up to pop it out my two man

[01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:56.500]
We got a couple of real hot horses there tonight. Did we ever get the information on the

[01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:58.720]
Draw nothing

[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:02.440]
You know this place is starting to give me a little bit pissed off today

[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:08.380]
I hate to put in those grotesque terms, but I understand it's between like Christmas and New Year and nobody wants to be here

[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:12.600]
And the show is like dying over here. We understand all of that, but let's face it

[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:18.800]
There's some important business here that's got to be taken care of and like denibers out of town or somewhere and

[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:24.320]
The sales department kids all in the hands of KT. I think he's the only one back there which speaks for itself

[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:25.360]
man

[01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:30.020]
Anyway, the line five is working out man. Are we excited or what?

[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:32.920]
God, it's about time, huh?

[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:37.500]
And line four is the only open line on the board and I'm told that

[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:42.800]
Yeah, it's working that's amazing my Emmy

[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:55.520]
You know every day that I've been in this market is epitomized by that moment. Okay? 15 years of wasted time

[01:32:56.320 --> 01:33:01.380]
Finally get every line working. We're all excited. I punch up the first one. That's on a thing here

[01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:03.940]

[01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:25.280]

[01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:02.760]
I got it 12 can it be felping number one. I just came off of 40 state business trip. I was gone about three months

[01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:08.020]
Um, I saw good fellows in in LA and you're going to find that picture

[01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:11.300]
It's the best picture gangster type picture i've seen this is great now

[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:15.780]
We can talk about it tomorrow all day that'll kill Friday and then Monday which we got to work new years

[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:19.600]
Eve day would kill Monday with it okay, but it will be all set will kill us here

[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:23.900]
Okay, now let me tell it all so I was in LA. I heard like is he's doing the same old stuff

[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:27.960]
I was in San Francisco. I could only take about five minutes of Bennett. Was he singing?

[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:34.920]
Yeah, oh it shocked me. I was in Chicago. I heard last year. Yeah, he had his wife on it really shocked me

[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.220]
There's no wife. Yeah, he sounds great

[01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:42.940]
Doing what? I mean, she just sounds bright and she's and she's well. He better watch it, you know

[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:46.340]
Yeah, and then the other thing this you'll get a kick out about he's on pretty thin ice

[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:50.340]
I was embossing the day after election day. Yeah, and apparently

[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:53.740]
Jerry Williams things went his way the way he was pushing

[01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:56.620]
So he's referring to himself as the dean

[01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:58.400]
I

[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:03.580]
Couldn't tell you one thing you she's you're old enough for it. Yeah, you'll mistake about that

[01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:08.200]
He was referring to himself as a dean. When he starts growing a little white go T. I'd start getting real nervous

[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:08.640]
Yeah

[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:15.720]
But I'm glad to be back and I'll tell you I listened to talk radio all over the country because there's been a lot of time in a car and music is boring

[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:18.960]
And you are definitely the best thing because even how it's turned

[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:23.060]
Even Howard admits it Howard said at neo-Rodgers. You know, he's a fat bag

[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:26.540]
He's the best thing on here in America. That's what he said. Well, I'll tell you how it's done

[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:28.600]
He blows hot and cold. Yeah

[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.340]
Yeah, Gordon Lidion one day was one of the greatest shows I've ever heard on radio

[01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:36.960]
But that was the only one out of about four of five. Well, he's so obsessed with that damn Jessica Han

[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:41.960]
I can't believe it. Oh, I'll be honest with you know since she got a complete body change. He looks incredible

[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:46.860]
Yeah, but her her attitude and brain isn't much. Oh, they're none resistant

[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:52.220]
But she got like a whole body change. Oh, yeah, they pay boy playboy pay for the whole thing. It's like they took her brain

[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:57.060]
Which didn't take it off a lot like in a thimble and they stuck it in a whole new body. It's incredible. Yeah

[01:38:57.740 --> 01:39:00.200]
Okay, I'm thinking about trying the same thing have a great life

[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:05.020]
1258 at W.I. It and all your people from New England. Okay. We're second-tired. All your belly

[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:09.280]
And that's all you do is cry and kvetch we don't want to hear about it go back and tell to Jerry Williams

[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:14.080]
Okay, that's see now old man. You know hold he must be now man is he old

[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:16.500]
He's got to be about 70

[01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:24.080]
What are you smiling about he was 58 when he got mugged in 1980 that famous night on the air he was leaving town

[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:25.980]
That's 10 years ago

[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:29.460]
So he's 69 68 and he's pushing 70

[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:34.460]
How'd you like to be 70 and sitting on the air talking to a bunch of assholes every day, huh? God

[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:36.980]
If I had to do this another 22 years

Let's go to a nice lady in bokeh

[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:05.000]
Neil hi good afternoon. How are you? Are you a nice lady? I'm a very nice lady. That's what George said

[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:08.800]
I know don't you remember me from a couple of years ago?

[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:16.020]
Oh, uh, no, no, I didn't think so well. How could I remember from a couple of years ago?

[01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:18.260]
But I can't even remember where I was last week at this time

[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:25.900]
That's really true, but I thought maybe if I jogged your memory a girlfriend and myself who used to sell pharmaceuticals

[01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:30.480]
Stop floor to send you a couple of goody back. That's a felding lady. Oh close

[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:35.240]
We gave you that black thing that had the bubbles in it that went out slowly but surely

[01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:36.760]
down the little

[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:43.620]
It had water in it and had oil coming out of it and you said it was naked little boys sliding down the

[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:44.780]
light off of

[01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:46.600]
95 and sterling

[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.360]
Why?

[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:54.020]
naked little boys sliding off the slide at i95 and sterling road. Yeah, that's what you say

[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:55.740]
I know

[01:41:56.340 --> 01:42:00.460]
Hey, by the way, where's the bird? I think a lot of chains since I've been here before

[01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:05.880]
Yeah, the bird is in Lakeland playing modavani records on a three watt FM station in his basement. Uh-oh

[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:06.820]
He's history

[01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:12.380]
Well, what about Steve Kane and Alice Rintel and where's all the people that used to be here?

[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:17.940]
They used to be where? Where have you been? Well, I've been in South Carolina. She's got to update me

[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:22.620]
Hey, well, I'll be guys staying. I don't have time to recap everything that happened

[01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:28.540]
But the Steve went to New York and Steve got fired and Steve's back on a six watt station in four-large day old WFTL

[01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:31.380]
Doing afternoons from two to six

[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:36.480]
But by the way, you know, I know that he would never tell a fib on the air much less a lie

[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:42.800]
But that thing about how they don't change their pattern at sundown or they don't change their power at sundown after five

[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:45.960]
What is it this month when we change pattern five thirty or five fifteen five thirty

[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:51.940]
After five thirty you could be like in plantation like at the corner of flamingo and

[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:56.980]
Sunrise you couldn't hear them if they gave you a million dollars to pick it up on your radio, okay?

[01:42:57.260 --> 01:43:03.520]
Okay, so I know that it must just have been a slip of the tongue when he denied that they cut out like four watts in that or whatever the hell it is

[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:12.980]
So in other words you still don't have any decent competition and Alice Rintel is coming back on FTL next week from ten to two right here in this slot some stiff competition

[01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:18.500]
And he means business this time no more shots from Neil. He's got a really butch up this time

[01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:23.880]
Yes, so he's gonna really do a number if we even have the and first of all and even no wise things

[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:25.960]
We're gonna talk about them because it's a waste of time

[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:28.980]
But what he has the veterinarian on that's tough to compete with

[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:32.560]
You know speaking about event and surely tweeters is gonna be on there

[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:37.540]
She changed her name to Goldilocks or something. She's gonna be do psychic nutritional readings overnighter

[01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:38.880]
It's gonna be great

[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:46.100]
Hey, Neil. Yeah, I think I need the bird to get some advice here that we got your bird right over here honey

[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:49.940]
What is it? Well, I've got it. I'm saying with a girlfriend in mind who has this little

[01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:55.360]
Gellikon airy that's losing his hair. Yeah, and I asked what was wrong with him and she said he has like a

[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:56.960]
A's disease of bird

[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:03.820]
And he won't eat and he just walked around his cave and he can't even fly yeah fly on this

[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:10.740]
Sick what do you mean nice lady in bokeh? She was a sick old bitch. What the hell are you talking about or sick young bitch?

[01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:13.340]
It's 11 past one at W.I.O.D

[01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:17.800]
We have an opening on the Palm Beach line man. Is it great to have line five working again or what huh?

[01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:21.360]
God we should stick around to an extra two or three hours or not

[01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:23.940]
Why are you okay? I think during the

[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:27.800]
Cosfield Saltsman's online I think that man he can go down to get my check for me

[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:29.160]
Give him something useful to do

[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:33.460]
Somebody's got to go there and take care of this go down to accounting and make a scene down there jump up

[01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:36.340]
And down take your pants down that'll get their attention briefly

[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:39.000]
Okay, let's do this right this time, okay

[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:44.740]
You I.O.D. We have an open line in Dave County, so it's really strange going on

[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:51.660]
Miami hello. Yes, sir. How you doing? Neil. Okay. Well, wait a minute. Isn't that what you said pretty close

[01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:54.340]
Okay, even admits it now. Go ahead

[01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:57.120]
Looks like the cops are gonna do it this year. We're doing it

[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:58.960]
I think got a George Bell

[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:06.460]
George Bell we got Danny Jackson got Andre the giant we got Ryan O we got Mark Grace we got Greg Maddox

[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:11.140]
What the hell more do you want? Well, I wouldn't rely on Danny Jackson for maybe about maybe a couple of games five wins

[01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:16.680]
Maybe seven well, he gets a hang-el every now and then every now and then like the Mike Marshall of the pitching court

[01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:23.700]
Neil's one of my gonna help you kill maybe about four minutes and three seconds of airtime with with the mojo Nixon Elvis

[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:29.060]
Oh, do I have that in here or did I give it away? Oh, I do have it because I was supposed to give it away remember

[01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:33.780]
You don't remember you don't even know what that we're talking about and you brought it up and I brought it up

[01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:37.840]
No, don't you remember I had the uh thing here mode you're talking about skid roper

[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:41.620]
Right skid roper and mojo with mojo niggas and I had the thing in here

[01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:45.800]
I said some lady was supposed to come in and I was gonna give her this CD and she never showed up

[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:47.300]
That was when we were doing our lunch things

[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:51.800]
So somewhere in this damn thing. I'll find it during the break

[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:57.580]
If I don't play it that's because it's not in here not because I'm a slime ball, but it just might not be

[01:45:57.580 --> 01:45:59.860]
Well, you never can be sure

[01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:08.320]
American the blade of you stack for me. Okay, he's loving. I'm looking for it. All right. Appreciate me. I'll have a good holiday

[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.180]
Okay, 20 after

[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:15.260]
Yeah, she was supposed to come in and get that damn thing now. What did I do take it home?

[01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:20.480]
I wouldn't have done that what I got him we got him at and you realize now that Stan is gone

[01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:26.500]
And was there anybody else here who had CDs? I don't think so I think one of these in here might be sud

[01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:29.140]
So he claims I don't know which one it is, but these are all mine

[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:31.080]
Was that my check?

[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:32.680]
No

[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:36.680]
What we're gonna take lunch back if you don't cut the crap

[01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:40.940]
All right, it's 21 after a 1 to w.i.o.d

[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:44.760]
I'm gonna look furiously and frantically for that CD and probably won't find it in fact

[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:46.580]
I'd almost bet on it. We'll be right back

[01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:54.600]
The

[01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:00.920]
Okay, 126 the reason I played that is because there's a card that I've never seen before it says Gilbert

[01:47:01.460 --> 01:47:03.140]
compilation so it's like a

[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:08.880]
Four and a half minute card who the hell put this together since must have a whole bunch of Gilbert crap on there

[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:15.300]
And I think crap is the operative word what do you want Woody? I wanted to ask you why you don't do Camilla for a year round first of all

[01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:16.320]
And why is

[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:21.600]
You're squishing his face up against the glass window for the same reason

[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:23.980]
Oh 126 the w.i.d

[01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:29.380]
We have an open line indeed where we just hung up on Woody at 751 9463 751

[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:36.180]
W.i.o.d by the way speaking of Camilla Sousa our total on our way to 100,000 93,000 745

[01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:37.860]
and counting

[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:43.740]
Now what the hell is it Thursday that means tomorrow we're gonna get some mail and the weekend mailed very sometime next week

[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:45.280]
Right around the new year

[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:49.680]
We're gonna get to our 100,000 dollar goal. Un credible

[01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:56.120]
Fort Lauderdale. Hey, please not be done. Yeah, when is this? Hey, when is this?

[01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:59.520]
I just got back in from Washington. I've been up there for about five months now

[01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:03.840]
Yeah, and you know I'm and I so I haven't been keeping up with one going on, but

[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:06.000]
I've been I told all my friends about

[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:11.580]
The German Mickey Mouse Club and I know sometimes I know you don't like take requests or not depending on how busy you are

[01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:15.700]
No way to me you told all your friends about it. Are they here? No, no, I told you they're in Washington

[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:19.920]
I guess when I get a show in Washington like Howard then I'll play it. Okay

[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:26.980]
Thanks me, I'll play it if I can find it, but you don't understand you've been away. We got like 700 racks now

[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:27.480]
No kid

[01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:34.000]
God almighty the chances of my finding that on the scale of zero are a fear if you do I mean you know

[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.600]
It would be nice, but you can't you can't you know, you can't you can't I understand that's what they said to

[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:41.660]
Al Pacino in a movie and I don't think he could either

[01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:44.180]
Oh, I can't ask you what the other thing was then

[01:48:44.180 --> 01:48:49.840]
I mean everybody already said it that he died at the end of the movie, but I mean it was

[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:57.320]
They already kind of let that out of the bag any house. It's not like we're spoiling anything. Okay, where does not you Neil? Thank you. Okay. Are we prepared? Bye?

[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:01.920]
Oh god

[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:07.840]
German Mickey Mouse Club. Where the hell am I gonna find that we want to play it 7,000 times this year

[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:14.680]
And we got to get a whole bunch of material so that guy from the wing would get pacified. Okay, stick a pacifier in his mouth

[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:21.380]
Let's go to a mobile and West Palm Beach on the starline. Hello. Hi. Hi

[01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:28.280]
Guess what what I know that girl that calls from South Carolina. Yeah, boy. What a lucky break for you

[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:31.240]
But she's really not like that. I don't know what was wrong with her um

[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:36.220]
You know what she was talking about when she said that little thing with little things rolling around in and water

[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:43.360]
You know someone sent you a black thing with blue oil and it was like a little mini lava lamp and you would spin it around and oh

[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:49.040]
Yeah, you remember that yeah, I like that we're both pharmaceutical reps. You moved away and I still live here

[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:54.100]
Well, she's obviously anybody that would move to South Carolina in the first place has serious problems

[01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:58.440]
And I think it's affected whatever is left of her brain. Yeah, I think you're right. The hell is she talking?

[01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:00.720]
She has a cat and she named it Kasa

[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:02.020]
Kasa Pines

[01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:02.760]
Oh

[01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:07.240]
She's got a cat well, I'd answer that tells me everything I need to know about her

[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:13.380]
But wait, can I say one thing what's that um tell her to call me on my one 800 number and tell me where he is like caller

[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:15.280]
Okay

[01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:20.240]
Well, what does she got the number? Yeah, it's my one. Oh, I see and if she tells me where she's talking

[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:24.680]
That sounds like a personal message to me. No, it's not okay. I didn't say her name

[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:29.400]
It's an impersonal message, but I wanted to tell you one more thing and I bet you when she calls you

[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:34.360]
A lot nicer to you than she was to me. She was kind of snotty to be honest with you. We got like a bird fetish

[01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:39.460]
Yeah, what's out? That's like ancient history. You've been gone for over a year. You know what I got

[01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:45.440]
I used to send her tapes to your senses. She said no by now that she knew she just tried to be an Ojan provocateur

[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:52.020]
She's auditioning for FTO really probably show one other thing really quick. I thought good fellows. It's when it first came out

[01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:53.620]
Yeah, I'm really

[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.200]
kind of

[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:59.360]
Green minutes about blood and stuff. Yeah, an excellent movie. I loved it

[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:03.740]
But I had to close my eyes whenever they killed somebody in it. Oh good. In other words, there's a lot of murder in it

[01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:09.240]
A lot. Oh good. It's good. It makes me feel at home that way. It's a great story. It really is. Okay

[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:15.600]
Okay, we'll let you know look kill four hours with it tomorrow. Okay. We'll have the good good father. I want to hear it

Couldn't find that so I figured well listen. We try to please everybody. So just in case he likes this

[01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:38.420]
But I got it for Lauderdale

[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:45.500]
Eel. Yeah. Hi, since you recently spent time in Vegas. I've got a little betting story for you. Okay. Uh, yesterday

[01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:48.480]
I called a buddy markets up 5.44 go ahead

[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:49.560]
Speaking of betting

[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:50.680]

See if Phil wants us to guard by the way. Go ahead

[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:08.840]
And I guess he went over there this morning and the first thing the guy said it at the room was

[01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:13.840]
No way to mock. We don't listen. You're a great guy. We don't hold it against you. You smoked all our cigars

[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:19.380]
Like he pretends he's not listening, you know what I said? We don't mind. Okay. We understand you were on a very low budget

[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:21.540]
You can smoke all the cigars you want. Okay

[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:27.600]
Two boxes he's smoked all by himself he just locks himself in the closet and smokes the cigarette like chain smokes it

[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:33.500]
It's like getting even or something. I think Steve put him up to it. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Okay. So uh, he goes over to the uh,

[01:52:33.620 --> 01:52:41.360]
Wait a minute. You're not going to FTL are you? Is he going to FTL? Boy you and Nick man. What a team that'll be go ahead anyway back to big

[01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:47.320]
Um, so it goes over the room the first thing the guy says is lot presser. Boy. I don't think we got that one

[01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:54.300]
So then he looks oh yeah, there it is. So I said uh, I told my friend. I said I want to put a hundred bucks on state

[01:52:55.980 --> 01:53:00.040]
Yeah, I'm from Philadelphia. That's playing. That's one thing to me right. Let's play in its safe

[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:00.460]
So

[01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:06.220]
So he calls me back this morning says I've now got a hundred bucks on state. I don't know who to root for

[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:12.520]
In other words, he doesn't know who you got. No, well, he didn't have, you know, well, why not?

[01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:16.080]
Your bucks on state, you know, so I've got it. So, you know, yeah, you got something

[01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:23.100]
But I don't know what till it's all over. Well, Penn State's going to kick the race. I'm sorry. I think so and you're going to wind up losing

[01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:29.580]
Because you got FSU. I don't even know it. I don't know. He's also from Pennsylvania. So, you know, no, I don't know

[01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:33.520]
I don't want to start going back into Vegas again because we killed a couple of days on that and I don't you know

[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:37.340]
It'll be terminal if I say that and somebody will do it like an hour on it this afternoon and another station

[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:40.820]

Well one good shine deserves another sure good luck to you

[01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:52.820]
Some people never learn 143 at w. I. O. D. Let's go to fort lotterdale. Let's go to it

[01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:57.460]
Yeah, let's do it. That was a sad story. That was incredible. Yeah my heart is just

[01:57:58.060 --> 01:57:58.540]
trembling

[01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:04.480]
Listen to the waitances Monday to get on with my personal godfather story

[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:08.760]
Okay, now I'll need the music and I want show to prepare the pick card all right

[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:09.880]
Point going well

[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:14.500]
You know it's interesting because I just been putting away all the carts and now you're creating a lot of work

[01:58:16.900 --> 01:58:17.260]
Lot of

[01:58:17.260 --> 01:58:21.020]
I understand but it's like you don't you understand what it gets to be about the last 20 minutes

[01:58:21.020 --> 01:58:27.440]
We all pack up and we're ready to get there. I did wait Monday for nothing for here goes and it's truly a personal story

[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:30.800]
Okay, you'll have to help me with one thing what year?

[01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:35.100]
What year the what the hell was that what oh there we go. I was the wrong car

[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:39.460]
But let me ask the question first what year did the first go as far the book come out approximately

[01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:41.300]
You know the first book? Yes

[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:43.680]
Oh

[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:46.140]
I would sit when 68 oh

[01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:51.920]
Kids about these around 70 I would say even 70. Oh, that's even better for my story. Okay. Here goes

[01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:56.460]
I back in about 1967 ish all right

[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:07.540]
I'm a writer. I have a girlfriend who it turns out it turns out worked with and I knew the sister of Mario Puzo back in New York

[01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:12.140]
Yeah, of course. This is before anybody knew who Mario Puzo was

[01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:15.040]
And I will tell you this I'm bragging a little today

[01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:21.420]
I used to send money notes over to the office and all kinds of gags and all kinds of writing things and

[01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:27.160]
How one day Virginia Mario sister said to my friend Marsha that you know your friend

[01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:30.240]
No names mentioned shouldn't waste a time on the

[01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:34.940]
That bat lines ringing by the way George the bat lines ringing. Okay. No, no, I'll be finished

[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:41.320]
No, it's good. No, it's a real nice story. I have a real. Hey, didn't I give you that can only now just shut up and eat it

[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:47.420]
Let me finish. Okay, so she said you should tell your friend. This is my brother who turned out to be what the hell are you?

[01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:53.040]
Yeah, is a writer he goes to the new school this and that and she should take her writing seriously

[01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:57.380]
I mean, I was sort of being compared. Oh, we know who that is. Yeah, Puzo, which is real nice

[01:59:57.380 --> 01:59:59.920]
But here's the clinker there's a guy named so

[02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:03.560]
Living down here now getting this is where the pig noise comes in

[02:00:04.280 --> 02:00:09.360]
Just so happens the only kid only claimed to say my men in a few weeks ago and he's a real

[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:10.340]
oink oink

[02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:16.040]
Or all the many men you want male show in this pig and think he's better than any other man in the world. I think

[02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:21.140]
He happened to buy Mario Puzo's house at a North, New York

[02:00:21.140 --> 02:00:25.460]
So that's about his only claim to say man listening so you're a real

[02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:30.920]
Blind bug is but I feel good that you know, I really didn't know his sister and

[02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:35.800]
And up to two years later he becomes the biggest thing and unfortunately I haven't followed

[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:40.500]
him with that but I kind of rubbed out those with that famous and I think I'm definitely

[02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:43.660]
going to get to see this movie sooner than I ever would have thanks to you and your

[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:44.600]
followers.

[02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:46.540]
Okay?

[02:00:46.940 --> 02:00:47.500]
Is that it?

[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:48.240]
Yeah.

[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:49.120]
Okay.

[02:00:49.260 --> 02:00:49.260]

[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:50.280]
Sandy.

[02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:52.020]
Wow.

[02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:56.300]
I've heard of killing a couple of minutes but that was like butchering me.

[02:00:57.520 --> 02:00:59.220]
That's like the scene in Miami Blues.

[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:00.300]
Did you see Miami Blues?

[02:01:01.260 --> 02:01:01.520]
Anybody?

[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:02.800]
No?

[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:07.220]
There's a great scene in there where this nerd who's trying to be the Don Johnson of this

[02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:11.680]
movie goes in and he's holding up this store, this convenience store and he's got this

[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:17.040]
bodyguard in the closet and he comes out and the guy blows him away and he's got his hand

[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:17.780]
on the counter.

[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:21.380]
He's got one hand on the gun and one hand on the counter and he shoots a guy and he's

[02:01:21.380 --> 02:01:30.900]
got this big cleaver under the cash register and he chops off like all his fingers, like

[02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:32.400]
four fingers right in the counter.

[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:33.480]
They're just laying there.

[02:01:33.660 --> 02:01:34.180]
It's beautiful.

[02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:34.840]
It's great.

[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:38.040]
What the hell does that have to do with anything?

[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:04.600]
I get out and then they pull me back in.

[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:08.480]
148 at WIOD.

[02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:09.760]
The max card is for you.

[02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:10.520]
They'll make you an offer.

[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:11.320]
You'd be a fool.

[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:12.400]
Great.

[02:02:13.940 --> 02:02:14.380]
Okay.

[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:16.160]
152 at WIO.

[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:18.380]
The Ileana came in and said, how was your Christmas?

[02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:19.060]
I said, great.

[02:02:19.180 --> 02:02:20.380]
She said, you get everything you wanted.

[02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:22.760]
What a smart ass, huh?

[02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:24.400]
That'll be the day.

[02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:25.480]
Well, there's always hope.

[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:30.200]
Anyway, uh, suds by the way, Kim and Siddiquette, a great sale on coat hangers and zairs.

[02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:33.500]
So if his wife is listening, I'd head for the hills.

[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:33.940]
Okay.

[02:02:34.220 --> 02:02:36.300]
This man has got that look in his face.

[02:02:37.180 --> 02:02:37.580]
Incredible.

[02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:38.400]
You're brutal.

[02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:39.600]
Miami.

[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:45.000]
Oh, my God.

[02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:47.380]
Bring my way all around.

[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:48.780]
I'll wear your cow.

[02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:49.880]
How?

[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:50.940]
Excellent.

[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:51.740]
Okay.

[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:52.680]
Miami on two.

[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:53.000]
Hello.

[02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:53.640]
Hi, Neal.

[02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:53.940]
How you doing?

[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:54.380]
Okay.

[02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:59.040]
I was actually remote at Bizarre and I got a gift certificate at Chuck's takeout.

[02:02:59.220 --> 02:02:59.500]
Yeah.

[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:01.020]
What their Sunday night, it was fantastic.

[02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:01.720]
Great.

[02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:03.060]
It was really.

[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:04.620]
We should thank them again about 100 times.

[02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:07.000]
What did they send like $8 trillion worth?

[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:08.200]
I mean, it was really incredible.

[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:12.300]
Tell me, I think just about everybody who bought a tape, uh, got a gift certificate.

[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:12.660]
Right.

[02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:13.160]
Great.

[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:13.720]
Fabulous.

[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:14.360]
It's good.

[02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:15.740]
Also one thing about Wise Guy.

[02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:17.560]
I mean, um, good for us.

[02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:17.580]

[02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:19.500]
So that's based on a true story.

[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:21.340]
And it is a great movie.

[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:24.580]
The book Wise Guy is even better, like most books and movies.

[02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:26.520]
But um, it is great book too.

[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:28.320]
Well, I'll let you know tomorrow.

[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:32.900]
I'm going to, uh, I'm going to pack it about 400 boxes of milk duds and we'll check it out.

[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:35.060]
And the part about Al Pacino dying.

[02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:38.320]
And, um, Godfather three, that was in, um, light magazine.

[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:39.280]
Yeah.

[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:40.100]
About everybody.

[02:03:40.260 --> 02:03:43.100]
Well, let's see the point of it is you don't know how he's going to die.

[02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:45.580]
So you think he's going to die another way earlier.

[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:47.080]
But he doesn't.

[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:50.420]
But in the Andy dies, just like Marlon Brandt, well, it had to.

[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:51.760]
Yeah.

[02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:55.140]
Paved the way for Godfather for and, uh, what's his name?

[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:55.520]
Garcia.

[02:03:55.820 --> 02:03:56.220]
Andy Garcia.

[02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:57.720]
Okay. All right.

[02:03:57.800 --> 02:03:58.540]
Have a good one.

[02:03:58.660 --> 02:04:01.420]
You get from North Miami Beach or was it Miami Beach?

[02:04:01.460 --> 02:04:02.180]
I North Beach.

[02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:03.960]
North Miami Beach.

[02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:05.060]
Whatever.

[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:07.720]
Anyways, like a puny ugly kid in high school.

[02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:10.060]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:10.500]
Hello.

[02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:11.120]
Neil.

[02:04:11.340 --> 02:04:11.540]
Yeah.

[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:13.520]
Are you ready to do this service for me?

[02:04:15.180 --> 02:04:16.380]
What was this bonus, Sarah?

[02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:17.380]
Now, give me the line.

[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:18.980]
Give me the, where was that from?

[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:21.440]
That was after Sunday.

[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:22.360]
God shot on the cause.

[02:04:22.500 --> 02:04:22.960]
You got it.

[02:04:23.260 --> 02:04:23.900]
Did the greatest.

[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:25.280]
Why was that difficult?

[02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:27.940]
Well, I've got a few more, but I don't want to say to him any big things.

[02:04:28.020 --> 02:04:29.600]
Is there some day in that they may never come?

[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:31.240]
I'll ask you to perform a service.

[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:31.540]
Right.

[02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:32.180]
Right.

[02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:33.720]
And it isn't going to be a good day.

[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:36.940]
But in the meantime, except this justice is a gift on the day of the day of the wedding.

[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:37.600]
What about my daughter?

[02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:38.240]
That's great.

[02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:39.380]
My daughter's wedding day.

[02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:43.120]
Did you happen to notice that Dion is going to be in Miami on New Year's Eve?

[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:43.720]
I sure did.

[02:04:43.940 --> 02:04:44.240]
Okay.

[02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:45.380]
I know you're a Dion.

[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:46.060]
You bet.

[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:47.300]
So I'd call you on that.

[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:48.000]
Question.

[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:51.340]
I didn't catch your show yesterday because I was not able to listen.

[02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:52.200]
Well, it was terminal.

[02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:54.300]
You know, we did four hours on Godfather 3.

[02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:57.580]
And according to one of the radio talk show experts, it was terminal.

[02:04:57.840 --> 02:04:59.660]
Well, it's okay with me because I love it.

[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:00.040]
I could live on.

[02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:01.620]
It just didn't size up, I guess.

[02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:02.840]
Was it worth the thing?

[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:04.080]
I didn't hear your comment line.

[02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:04.840]
Absolutely.

[02:05:05.300 --> 02:05:05.740]
It was good.

[02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:07.080]
Don't listen to any other crap.

[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:07.860]
It's worth saying.

[02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:09.760]
Don't try to compare it to one or two.

[02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:11.520]
Just view it as a continuation.

[02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:13.120]
Take it for what it is.

[02:05:13.300 --> 02:05:16.300]
There are some weak points like there are in any movie, but it's on the whole.

[02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:17.000]
It's excellent.

[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:17.400]
Okay.

[02:05:17.540 --> 02:05:18.520]
So it's definitely worth a lot.

[02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:21.500]
I mean, it didn't grow six and a half million dollars the first day for nothing.

[02:05:21.660 --> 02:05:21.820]
Yeah.

[02:05:21.940 --> 02:05:23.340]
Well, that's been a big thing around the country.

[02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:24.860]
They've been showing on CNN and everybody.

[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:25.240]
Exactly.

[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:26.300]
It's the big story.

[02:05:26.300 --> 02:05:28.900]
And I get ripped because I spent a day talking about it.

[02:05:28.940 --> 02:05:31.400]
Now, of course, so we spent part of today also a lot of it.

[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:33.300]
But because that's the number one topic, right?

[02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:35.100]
Well, that's what people are excited about.

[02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:36.060]
Well, let me tell you something.

[02:05:36.180 --> 02:05:39.840]
In my opinion, it's one of the greatest acting jobs ever by Marlon Brando.

[02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:41.260]
It was one of the best actors in America.

[02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:42.820]
So why not talk about it?

[02:05:43.580 --> 02:05:44.540]
You mean the first one?

[02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:45.360]
Well, yeah.

[02:05:45.620 --> 02:05:46.940]
I mean, you know, but that's what it was all about.

[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:52.080]
Well, what about, but this is also one of the great jobs by Al Pacino and Andy Garcia's tremendous.

[02:05:52.300 --> 02:05:52.440]
Yeah.

[02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:53.080]
How's standing?

[02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:54.340]
He's not becoming star.

[02:05:54.420 --> 02:05:54.620]
Yes.

[02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:55.560]
Well, anyway.

[02:05:55.580 --> 02:06:00.800]
And I hope he remembers all of his pizons here in the South Florida and sends us a lot of money like Johnny Defton do.

[02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:07.060]
I took some photographs into a coconut grove camera where I live in the grove and his sister still lives in Miami.

[02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:10.080]
And this guy that works behind the things is, hey, you want to see some pictures of Niagara Steele?

[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:13.640]
They show me some like Thanksgiving pictures out in California.

[02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:14.560]
And there he was.

[02:06:14.740 --> 02:06:16.280]
It's just the normal guy sitting around the table.

[02:06:16.420 --> 02:06:16.960]
Just a guy.

[02:06:17.560 --> 02:06:21.420]
But the vet, now listen, when you see this movie, don't just look about for the acting.

[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:24.180]
Keep in mind that this is history also.

[02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:25.680]
There's so much truth in this thing.

[02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:29.500]
And, you know, the thing about the Vatican banking scandal in the Bank of Movelaria

[02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:33.220]
and the Pope dies mysteriously in good health and goes to Betty feels great.

[02:06:33.260 --> 02:06:34.140]
He don't get up in the morning.

[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:36.020]
Just keep that all in mind.

[02:06:36.020 --> 02:06:36.640]
It's incredible.

[02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:39.080]
Well, you know, I'm probably as thick a fan as you are.

[02:06:39.220 --> 02:06:40.480]
So I'm not going to be disappointed.

[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:44.360]
But just to tell you, my feeling is, I'm glad you're talking about the Godfather.

[02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:47.020]
Because it's an interesting trilogy of movies.

[02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:49.460]
And as other people don't like it, let them call them after.

[02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:50.220]
Yes, screw them.

[02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:50.600]
Okay.

[02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:52.500]
Let them take their measuring stick and sit on it.

[02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:52.800]
Okay.

[02:06:52.860 --> 02:06:53.040]
That's right.

[02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:53.420]
Listen.

[02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:58.380]
Like Marlon Brando said, I don't apologize for not, like he said at the end of the movie.

[02:06:58.380 --> 02:07:01.760]
I said, I don't apologize for the way I ran my family.

[02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:01.960]
Right.

[02:07:02.180 --> 02:07:03.480]
I never wanted this for you.

[02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:03.840]
Right.

[02:07:04.060 --> 02:07:05.500]
I thought it'd be governor calling you.

[02:07:05.620 --> 02:07:06.540]
Senator Colioli.

[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:08.720]
But another president of aunted.

[02:07:08.860 --> 02:07:09.700]
Fred, he's weak.

[02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:10.380]

[02:07:10.940 --> 02:07:11.280]
Like a son.

[02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:11.920]
See ya.

[02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:13.380]
He sleeps with the fishes.

[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:16.280]
157 at WIOD.

[02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:17.400]
Fort Lauderdale.

[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:22.200]
I should be banished to listen to STL for the next two or three weeks.

[02:07:22.220 --> 02:07:24.000]
However long they last.

[02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:26.380]
But I'm going to say something against...

[02:07:28.900 --> 02:07:31.060]
Everything that everybody told you today.

[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:31.660]
Yes.

[02:07:31.940 --> 02:07:33.760]
Good fellows is a good movie.

[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:34.840]
That's it.

[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:36.160]
It's a good movie.

[02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:37.300]
But not a great movie.

[02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:37.940]
Exactly.

[02:07:38.700 --> 02:07:39.260]
So in other words.

[02:07:39.340 --> 02:07:40.920]
But you're going to be disappointed, Neil.

[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:43.120]
Don't compare it to God for the rest of the movie.

[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:44.200]
Oh, I'm not comparing it.

[02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:45.620]
But I mean, if it's good, it's good.

[02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:48.900]
If it happens to be right there, I could roll a stone for my house to where it's planned.

[02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:51.180]
No, I know where you live and I know where it's planned.

[02:07:51.420 --> 02:07:51.520]
Right.

[02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:52.820]
It's a good movie.

[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.680]
It does not compare.

[02:07:55.180 --> 02:07:56.500]
And it's all three.

[02:07:56.700 --> 02:07:58.260]
And I've seen all three of them.

[02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:01.660]
And I'm in the guard for the intensive as you are.

[02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:04.180]
And it's a good movie.

[02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:05.760]
I didn't work out of this here.

[02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:07.540]
Excited or related.

[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:12.460]
And everybody is going to jump because all morning one of them has been telling how great it is.

[02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:13.140]
Oh, yeah.

[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:14.280]
Well, not just today.

[02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:14.740]
Yesterday.

[02:08:14.880 --> 02:08:17.320]
Oh, they're going out like, oh, forget about this one.

[02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:17.920]
You didn't see.

[02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:20.620]
And a lot of the reviewers are saying the same thing.

[02:08:20.620 --> 02:08:21.260]
Like, oh, good.

[02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:23.260]
This isn't even in the class with good fellows.

[02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:24.760]
It's like one of the top of the year.

[02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:28.000]
I'm anxious to hear tomorrow more than this.

[02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:28.160]

[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:29.500]
Do I dare you or anyone?

[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:30.160]
What?

[02:08:30.260 --> 02:08:33.260]
Whether I have to listen to SCL for two weeks or not.

[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:34.880]
Where do you live?

[02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:36.680]
I live in Fort Lauderdale.

[02:08:36.740 --> 02:08:38.140]
Oh, well, you could at least pick it up.

[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:40.320]
Well, that's something to be on the safe side anyway.

[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:41.080]
Oh, yeah.

[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:42.920]
I can pick it up if I have to.

[02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:43.440]
Yeah.

[02:08:43.780 --> 02:08:44.480]
If you're desperate.

[02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:45.880]
If you banish me to it.

[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:46.800]
Never have to.

[02:08:46.940 --> 02:08:47.320]
Okay.

[02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:48.360]
I'll let you know.

[02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:49.320]
Thank you.

[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:49.720]
See you.

[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:50.100]
Bye.

[02:08:50.700 --> 02:08:51.700]
Boy, that's music.

[02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:55.500]
It's like, it's like, it's like a neurotic obsession, isn't it?

[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:01.400]
They say you want to go out and you just pound the pasta.

[02:09:05.100 --> 02:09:06.500]
Who is that?

[02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:08.100]
Is that?

[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:09.180]
Oh, no.

[02:09:09.780 --> 02:09:12.360]
Is that Francis Ford and Mara and Sophia?

[02:09:13.220 --> 02:09:14.220]
Oh, God.

[02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:16.820]
They shot her to a screen.

[02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:18.500]
They shot her to cement.

[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:21.660]
Remember, I used to say they shot Donna Mills to Lynne Olium.

[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:23.880]
They shot her through some, and she's like in a background.

[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:24.620]
Here's Francis.

[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:25.720]
What magazine is this?

[02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:27.380]
This is in People.

[02:09:27.980 --> 02:09:34.480]
And here she is with a schnauz that killed Vermont and the cock-eyed lips that point toward Massachusetts.

[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:36.220]
Oh, man.

[02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:39.380]
She is a thing of beauty and a joy forever.

[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:41.140]
Well, listen, have a wonderful day.

[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:43.780]
We'll see you tomorrow morning at 10 and rehash all these disgusting movies.

[02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:45.640]
Anyway, we got, is it Elaine?

[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:46.860]
Is it Stephanie?

[02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:50.200]
It's Stephanie.

[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:53.540]
He is, I'm telling you, he is on permanent vacation and he don't know it yet.

[02:09:53.620 --> 02:09:54.800]
Even Aerospace is embarrassed.

[02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:56.800]
And then we got Dick and Dutta too.

[02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:00.000]
We got Hurricane Hotline with Joe and the Jim at 605.

[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:03.240]
Hurricane Basketball to Palm Beach Classic at 8 tonight.

[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:05.240]
South Florida's new.
