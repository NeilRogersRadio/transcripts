[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]
One spot was playing I'd have to queue up another real real tape

[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.620]
We'd have like five spots in a row. It was the most ectic the most pressure-filled morning show in the history of mankind

[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.880]
All you did was just queue up spots and then you give the time and you play another spot

[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.960]
And then maybe a record which give you a chance to queue up all four or five more spots

[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.880]
But they had these big cylinders and they had numbers like one through a hundred or one through two hundred and we could put all this stuff on

[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.960]
something like that and just have them in a little computer and

[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.120]
And punch up like number 78

[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.200]
Okay, well get that stuff on for that guy with him

[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.980]
We'll lose all the remaining calls what we've got but we don't care because it's Labor Day weekend

[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.200]
We don't expect anybody to call if you call we consider it a bonus, okay?

[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.920]
Tomorrow is a bonus to you. I yours truly me

[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.900]
I'm gonna be at the fountain shops of distinction and the food courtyard next to corkies restaurant in plantation

[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.400]
A remote appearance in my actual hometown. I can't believe it

[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.080]
801 South University Drive just a block south of the Broward Mall and it's the kickoff for their scheduled weekly

[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.320]

For the kids for you and the whole family will have free prizes tomorrow pizza compliments of strumbly pizza

[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.100]
We'll have those pictures allegedly alleged

Uh-huh and a lot of those brand new unbelievable bumper stickers are come out out say hi tomorrow noon to three at the fountain shops of

Distinction will be right in the food courtyard next to corkies

[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.560]
And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand whether we have kids or pets or neither

[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.300]
It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio and here's what he writes

[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.580]
Dear Casey this may seem to be a strange dedication request

[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.060]
But I'm quite sincere and it'll need a lot if you play it

[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.500]
Recently there was a death in our family

[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.120]
He was a little dog named snuckles, but he was most certainly a part of let's come start again

[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.600]
From coming out of the record play the record, okay

[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.580]
Please

[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.920]
See when you come out of those up-tempo damn numbers man is impossible to make those transitions

[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.320]
And then you got to go into somebody dying you know they do this to me all the time

[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.040]
I don't know what the hell they do it for but damn it if we can't come out of a slow record

[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.320]
I don't understand it is down on the phone

[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.140]
Okay, I want a damn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a

[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.120]
Being up-tempo record every time I do a damn death dedication

[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.080]
Now make it and I also want to know what happened to the pictures. I was supposed to see this week

[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.800]
It's a god last damn time. I want somebody use this in brain to not come out of a damn record

[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.700]
That is that's up-tempo and I got to talk about a peck and dog dying

[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.620]
Well, it's a

[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.880]
Bondarist man

[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.780]
Bondarist and ponderous another edition of America's bottom 40

[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:26.080]
Want to you buy the oxy five companies newest acne medication oxymoron five for a pimple-free teenagers

[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.540]
So it goes

[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.860]
Ha

[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.340]
I have to be a little quick on the tape boy

[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:44.440]
The good show we've got the worst songs in America and we're counting them down record stories are showing them

[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.180]
For some unknown reason you're buying them and I'm using them as coasters

[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.380]
Let's review the top three songs on the charts at number three guns and roses is singing sweet out of mind

[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.920]
Well, if I had a child around the house today I'd have these four words for lead guitar is slash and his chords

[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.620]
Stay the hell away

[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.960]
And number two you a who says they're eating a living in a perfect world and especially not for you

[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.080]
You reasoned you don't speak proper English

[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.620]
And a number one George Michael sings he's got a monkey on his back

[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.580]
Well, I would imagine it's getting a little crowded back there

[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.820]
Oh

[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.540]
But then again you probably don't mind

[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.540]
And by the way George there are these remarkable shaving instruments called razor

[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.260]
One and lose that silly ass

[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.940]
Other songs on the charts the band Johnny H. Jazz with I want to be a hero is moving down on the charts and deservedly so

[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.040]
Apparently Johnny also gave music

[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.340]
I don't think he'll status is eminent Johnny so get a real job

[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:13.000]
And there is a song I like Rod Stewart's newest release forever young and for a moment I thought it was a song about me forever hung

[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.620]
Now it's time for a long distance dedication

[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.820]
It comes to us from a listener and bastard in the California right to dear Casey

[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.980]
I'm 16 years old President of my class and six foot to I've blonde here way

[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.860]
175 pounds and started quarterback for my high school team

[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.300]
But Casey I have a problem the girls simply will not leave me alone

[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.940]
It seems as though they want me for his my good looks my excellent physique

[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:49.200]
Why can't they just like me as a friend treat me as a person instead of some sex object and quit hitting upon me all the time

[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.500]
Casey do you have any suggestions

[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.160]
Shine Todd well here's my answer

[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.660]
dear flanking

[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.300]
1127 at W.I.D. I think we're playing both cards. I should get a little more than just a t-shirt. Don't you like something

[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.500]
28 past 11 and the don't forget Rick and suds are gonna be doing their show from Joe Robby stadium

[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.620]
We're still trying to figure out exactly what that means

[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.280]
Dick Clark is gonna be there from three to three thirty

[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.480]
I hope to be involved toly carrying me away at four o'clock the dolphin cheerleaders Jennifer and Mary who are gonna be

[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.520]
Taking it off and doing just wild suggestive erotic things in the booth what you won't be able to see

[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.680]
And Tim Robby is gonna be there

[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.500]
And at five o'clock to really dead in the proceedings

[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.320]
Joe Zagaki is gonna be there so that we can kind of let the sports department take over the control

[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.780]
As we get a little bit too close to a dolphin time before um, you know what I'm what I'm talking about before it gets too late

[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.200]
And anyway Joe and Hank are gonna be doing sports talk and then we got the game at eight o'clock

[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.280]
We have a pressure packed fun feel day today, right?

[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:58.340]
And then on Monday Labor Day, I don't even want to go into it against. It's more than I can handle Palm Beach Gardens

[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.860]
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey listen. I just wanted to talk about the mess for a minute here

[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.260]
I know it's not one of your favorite topics

[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:11.080]
But you know yesterday when they went two to one they eat one out last night when they pound them and hit home runs

[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.460]
You know they got lucky

[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.640]
What's it? I also said that I'm nervous that I think they're gearing up and they're gonna win it

[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.020]
Did I say that? Well, I could have said the meds sock. They're not gonna

[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.880]
I think that they're getting their rack together. We're gonna hate to say but I think it's happening all right

[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.600]
Well good. I'm getting good pitching again now even that stick in cone

[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.400]
Why don't like in Fernandez struck out 85 million guys the other night. They're looking pretty tough

[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.520]
Hey, those two guys are the best mediocre record pictures in the league

[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.180]
Well, they're definitely a feared picture now I'd be honest with you if I had a big game to win

[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:50.440]
I don't think I'd start either one of them. Oh, well cone is good. I think I don't agree with you

[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.480]
I don't like David Cohn

[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:58.140]
What about this new guy? I'm glad they got darling out of there if this guy goes this week and then against the pirates next weekend

[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:03.060]
We could have we could really have something together. I think they're bringing back John Matlack just in case

[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.400]
Yeah, I got a ball sign by John Matlack and Yuri Kuzman

[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.460]
Jerry Kuzman and Tom Seever just in case

[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:14.900]
How listen if Oakland can bring in all these other guys will I McGee at any trade these I just don't understand it

[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.700]
Yeah, what about Gary Gentry?

[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.900]
There you go. There's another name from the past who also picks for the braves didn't they? Yeah, right? We're Mickey Lola

[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.460]
Oh, please talk about talk about talk about the Rick Russel look alike

[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:32.400]
Did you hear that tape by play to that pirate cub game? Yeah, really that fat Russel was pitching that was 1974

[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.080]
That's like a whole lifetime ago. Yeah, I don't want to think pirates right now. They're getting all the press anyway

[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.800]
Well, they blew that game or no, they won that game. Yeah, right. Well, I'm sorry about that

[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:46.280]
But at 16 years ago, don't hold it against them now. I don't tell you the more met the poised right what are they game in a half right now?

[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.180]
Yes, sir, they're poised right well, it's gonna go right down to the wire

[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:54.880]
I said that about three months ago and everybody laughed and thought I was just saying it to be well a dramatic and because it's the corny thing to say

[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.020]
But it's gonna go right down to the wire

[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:02.160]
Yeah, well that last weekend when the cubs play six against the pirates and six against the met and then

[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.720]
You do understand that those three games have been added on that they have to make up right at the very end of the season

[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.840]
The met and the pirates have a three game series. Where is that you know? No, I don't know

[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.420]
We'll find out somebody will call in that. I mean that is gonna be incredible

[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.820]
Yeah, well the met's right now. I tell you

[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:24.680]
Home runs there. They're doing good shape. I've been a met man. I'm not just let's see if you can keep Darryl awake for another month

[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.240]
You know, that's a problem with him. He goes into these long comas

[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.660]
Yeah, I think that's just the way he is kind of like the Joseph Gackie of baseball

[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.620]
It was into a long deep sleep

[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.500]
Well, listen, you know, I don't I just don't harbor those hostile feelings anymore

[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:44.120]
You know, I really don't know whoever wins it wins it and now that David Johnson's gone and they're putting his face back together

[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:49.020]
Why get upset? Yeah, but I'm in the car yesterday and I'm boiling met and Neil saying they eat one out two to one

[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.540]
Well, listen, I mean, so if you guys are gonna win it at least we give you a little heartache could go along with it okay

[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.940]
It's still a window and the record books where the guy had detects his leg or

[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.420]
That's right even though Sandberg hit that home run last night

[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:05.940]
It's still a loss no matter what the do you realize that Ryan Sandberg is the first second baseman in the history of baseball

[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:11.400]
To have two consecutive years of 30 or more home runs and you realize that sir in the history of the game

[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.700]
He's got he's dynamite. I mean, I know he's no Greg Jeffries, but he's not too bad

[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.900]
Well, I caught that on the radio last night your friend Bob Murphy when Jeffries hit that home

[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.840]
Where he wanted to say so bad that he just broke the record for his home run by a second basement for the met

[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.340]
But he was playing third base. Yeah, he like did his tongue right in the middle there

[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.880]
Well no matter where Jeffries plays it doesn't make too much difference here. Yeah, that's true. He could be the DH

[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:40.220]
Yeah, right. Well, hey Kim Tofu. What about him Tim Tofu? Yeah, he's my favorite. He's a real powder pot

[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.860]
Well, I don't know. It's it's gonna be tough. It's gonna be real interesting and exciting

[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.060]
That's all of counts as long as there'll be excitement

[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.840]
I know it's not as exciting as these exhibition football games, but we're doing the best we can

[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.620]
Well right on the elite a couple positive words about the match will you know make me feel a little bit better

[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:59.180]
Well, I said you guys are getting hot at just the right time. Yeah, well more can I say coming from me?

[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.580]
I mean, that's a major concession

[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:05.880]
You better be nice to me because I'm gonna say it again. We got six games against you guys

[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.500]
The last 10 days of the season

[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.420]
Well, that's what I was gonna ask you now if you're very nice if you're real nice

[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.220]
We'll start but lucky a couple of times and we'll bring in Jeff Pico

[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.760]
That's not a good ass if you guys could lay down a little well

[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.420]
I'll I'll see how things go. Okay, well, I could do good luck

[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.400]
Well, there's a good match fan. You got a little sense of humor and he's not all up tight

[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.400]
He's a good guy. Well, how the hell did that happen?

[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.860]
Anybody knows when those last three are gonna be played at the end of the regular season. Please let us know

[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.820]
I mean that's important because obviously the match are playing much better at

[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.960]
Home than they are in the road and the pirates at the moment are like swanning no matter where they are

[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.060]
27 till noon and W.I.O.D. Let's do a little thing here. We'll be right back

We just want everybody to be real happy, okay? Okay. Let's make it last food tomorrow. We'll look for you down at

[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.080]
Fashion mall right then we can be depressed on Sunday

[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:02.600]
Well, then we can go back to public and see what's left there. Yeah, I wanted to ask I got some friends coming down for the weekend and

[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.260]
Last year what I think when your sponsors was lots of Bernetta

[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:06.780]
Mm-hmm

[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.540]
Stolts and colors that used to be is it one is it still is good?

[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.680]
She just brought in Carolyn just brought in food yesterday morning on that the end of the mic winery show

[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.540]
I had a little a total any just a little bite or two it is spectacular

[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.580]
Just a notch, huh? In fact if you listen in the next time going to be doing a commercial

[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:29.640]
I will be waxing elegantly about a lot of banana great, so you would recommend it highly enthusiastically the best

[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:30.980]
very good

[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.660]
And the next thing I was gonna ask you how come you're thinking moving from plantation up north to oral spring

[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:42.740]
Who said I'm doing that you did no, I'm not I was just talking about the beautiful homes at the carriage point

[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:48.180]
I'm not gonna move. I would I want to move that far north really I might as well commute from Daytona

[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:54.500]
That's true now that they're finally starting to do something about the potholes and fixing a broward and knob Hill road and all that

[00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:00.540]
Hey, listen, I'm not moving far from my public's in clear a knob hill. Okay. My life is in that store

[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.400]
I love ride across the street from it. I know what your speed really? Oh, yeah

[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:09.100]
The only thing is I keep talking about I've made it so popular now that it's getting crowded

[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:15.140]
Well now that the school's open to you it's it's a traffic problem in the morning trying to get over there. Mm-hmm that

[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:22.620]
Anyway, it's still a good place. It could be a lot worse. It's a great place. Not a good place. It's sensational

[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.560]
Well, that's that's why I like it there

[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:29.220]
But we'll look for you tomorrow. No, okay. I'll see you at pubics. Okay, bye-bye

[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.240]
21 till noon at W. I. O. D. That was one of my exciting neighbors from plantation

[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.040]
Maybe my good friends from may fair will come by okay?

[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:42.620]
The good folks I used to live across from who made my life miserable and the gut carried on and hocked a trinic about my satellite dish

[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:46.680]
Maybe those people will come by and say hi at the fountain shops tomorrow from noon to three

[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.800]
Would that be great? I will put something special in their pizza from stromboli

[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:57.180]
Okay, don't forget out goldstein's coming at noon. He's gonna be really pissed when he sees that most of the food is gone too bad

[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.800]
Is Jeff coming with more food? Do we know?

[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.700]
Arnold's coming back again Cheryl did you hear that?

[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.860]
Arnold's is coming back again

[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.180]
Murray and Wayne are coming back to bring you

[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.420]
Probably another dose of all this stuff. Are they nuts?

[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.160]
How can they do that? You know he brings in all of this stuff

[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:24.000]
And you know how busy they are over there all the time and I just don't understand how they can make this much food like Jeff the same thing

[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.120]
He brings in if you could see when they carry all this food and looks like he's gonna feed to all of our troops

[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.200]
In the Middle East I just don't understand it just

[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.440]
HUNS and tons of stuff. I cannot conceive of how long

[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:40.480]
The preparation time is luckily does the stuff was ricken-mut and you know

[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.740]
It feeds the people on the street court and makes 300 pies in 20 minutes. I don't get it

[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.260]
I just don't understand how he does it

[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:53.580]
Well look at that already have to do is mention Jeff Cohen's name and he's immediately on the hotline just a pizza maker in heat

[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:58.600]
Are you doing the okay Jeff on I 95 already with food in hand really?

[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:03.080]
Well look at the timing of this funny till noon. Now Goldstein will be here at 12. It'll be hot

[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.460]
It'll be delicious and fresh

[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.940]
That's how we do it at the law will keep his monster for a few minutes

[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.240]
I don't leave that but I've I'm gonna let you borrow some of my WIOs

[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.460]
Neel Roger's pictures well isn't that great you're the guy that's got them all huh?

[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.600]

[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:24.140]
I have them whenever you need them great. So we'll see in about 20 minutes. Thanks Jeff. All right, bye

[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.960]
Well, that should the pacify that fat Goldstein shouldn't

[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.720]
Who's in the limo as we speak or that limo is never gonna be same again?

[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.880]
Can you just see it coming down the road with like the front end? Yeah, the back is like weighted down

[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.620]
The front is like the wheels are barely touching the ground

[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.160]
Miami

[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:43.740]

22 on where you're so called non-listeners non-existent. Yeah, the phantom strikes again

[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:11.140]
Listen, I'm not gonna be able to listen no more after today. Why's that getting a new job and they listen to classic oldies

[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:15.480]
What that's what they do over there. They listen to tragic

[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:21.660]
tragic 102.7 yep rhymes with on 11 as in bread as in Mata

[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.800]
I don't know what you got to be kidding. What are they into Johnny Rivers is that it?

[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.640]
Back Rivers. Oh God money Rivers. I'm too young for this stuff

[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:37.380]
So what's gonna happen? We're finished with you. You're done. You're writing us off. You're kissing me off and like that

[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.780]
No, you'll have to have your brother tape the show

[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.700]
Or else or how old your brother?

[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.560]
26 I was gonna say otherwise you beat the crap out of him

[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.460]
But I guess in this case that's not gonna fly right? No, not at all well time to tape the show

[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.900]
Are you in ten of your friends will beat the crap out of my house? That sounds good. Okay?

[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.080]
Have a great life. See you

[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.680]
1142 at W.I.O.D. Now, what is that that?

[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.660]
Who's on the bat line? That's not for me. Does anybody I know?

[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.580]
That is Norman Kent. It's probably not in strip not Norman Kent boy

[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.200]
That would be exciting if it really turned out to be norm Kent and

[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.560]
It really is okay here's second well see now

[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:27.300]
Okay, what did we do to deserve this honor? Well, I want you to be a judge next week in a very important

[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.860]
Contents by the way, where's that check now that it's Norman Kent? Where's that check in the mail? Okay? Yeah, right?

[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:38.040]
You win Larry King. It's in the mail and wait until you see the new Honda motorcycle I got really but

[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.440]
Surreal we want you to be a judge next week my friend Brian Smith has the

[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.460]
No chance Brian Smith the interstitial you know that the norm can't be seriously

[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.080]
Considering putting Mike Polackie the lucky back on his rotisserie baseball team

[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:56.000]
No, this is serious. He's putting on a play. I'm still trying to ignore you. I know

[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.320]
But this is an exciting play. We want you to be the judge for the understudy for the play Maryland in her own words

[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.840]
We want you to judge who the best Maryland Monroe

[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.980]
I have a better idea now why don't you have Steve come and walk around naked that would bring a lot more people on

[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.520]
He's already tried that and that play last year and frightened people away

[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:19.400]
But only because I heard that that baseball card show we had was just a monster success

[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:20.680]
I

[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.840]
heard that they had throng of people at least three right

[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:30.220]
But now if you were to judge this Maryland Monroe understudy it would probably be a dream on your park because it's never gonna happen

[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.000]
Never gonna happen. I hate listen

[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.960]
I have to I have to stick with my

[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:41.520]
Satellite dish and my cubs. I can't miss a second. Well, what if we do videos of these understudy? Yeah, I'll do that

[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.200]
And then you could just sit in your room and decide which is bad exactly no problem

[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.260]
But it's making it really easy. They know me keep it real simple

[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.500]
They should call a theater if they want to be a Maryland Monroe, Jr

[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.760]
They should call what theater the pussy can Brian's theater. Oh Brian's theater

[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.760]
Just like a little plug for a friend in various dorm

[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:04.020]
Maybe we'd like to talk about norm kids baseball card heaven on federal highway in for a lot of

[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.220]
I'm not doing a plug. I'm helping your audience

[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:10.860]
Well listen listen the audience can handle it. They know you're in law and they know you're full of crap

[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.240]
So give a plug baseball card heaven for a lot of hell

[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.440]
You've got all kinds of memorabilia and old cubs seats from the bleachers and

[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.460]
You mean the east sunrise Boulevard and for a lot of right where where the road turns around

[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.040]
We're ricking the Spud had Marvin arrested that day

[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.240]
That was a good move by that that was really smart. Well, I put them on the mat

[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.820]
They wanted to get in real tight with the BSL

[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:30.560]
So

[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.960]
We can count on you then yes, sir. You just bring me that tape okay and put a little mic

[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.980]
Polucky on there too. I'll probably watch it

[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:42.280]
I'll mix it in with some videos. I've had some some my other kind of clients. I'll bet okay

[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:46.440]
Okay, that'll make the cheese more binding all right. Okay norm have a great weekend

[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:51.280]
45 at W.I.O. Du Bois like an old reunion here today, isn't it? God

[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.840]
Even starting to smell like an old reunion. I guess that's from all the food

[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.340]
So I'm gonna listen do not let me eat anymore because I overdid it

[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:04.860]
I had if I told the audience what I ate just now they would get very upset because my head is already swimming

[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.500]
Okay too much too much

[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.320]
So everybody just enjoy it will put out our ghost in fact

[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:15.300]
Jeff is bringing an enormous that even Rick and Sud to be embarrassed by this you know the little things

[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.900]
They do out there with a cake in the pie in the face that stuff

[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:26.380]
He's bringing this enormous that it shaped like a bathtub and all the lasagna and the sauce and the rigatoni and all and the

[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:31.260]
Mipol and they're gonna put out goldstein naked right in the middle of it and

[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.960]
Then we're gonna have people volunteer and just give him a fork and a spoon

[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.820]
Wouldn't it be great from the Ron Jeremy School of here in my meatball boy. He is just up

[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:47.400]
He's a furball goldstein a gigantic furball. Let's now see and Wayne is coming back

[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:52.660]
Miss psychotic he's coming back and you're the one that inspired him okay?

[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:58.760]
So the fact that it's right gonna be right at noon and he's gonna miss out all that lunchtime business and probably go out of business because you

[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.200]
I wanted your thinking B.L.T

[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.500]
Because the white hots and the Niley burgers weren't good enough for her highness

[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:08.280]
I don't want that to hold heavily over your conscience because you don't have one because you're Jewish

[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:09.640]
Hollywood

[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.240]
Yes, sir, yes, sir

[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.640]
I'm at the airport you're at the airport

[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.760]
I'm gonna get the airport Mr. Rogers. Yes, sir. Hey, Mr. Rogers. I got a question. Yeah, okay

[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.580]
Yeah, good call 1147 at W.I.O.D

[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:39.580]
We have two open lines in day two and brown. That's not like you're a witcher's a twin brother that just called I

[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:43.800]
Dumped it by the way sir. So you really wasted your time and I hope your plane is okay

[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:51.120]
You anti-Semitic red neck up notches. I must have been Rick Ciderman's twin brother. I think they're joined at the lift

[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:58.620]
Anyway, as we drive down the Ho Chi Minh trail. It's time to take one of those never-ending breaks and we'll be right back

[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:10.740]
Okay, 1151 at W.I.O.D. was that on the cart or what you notice every time Johnny's voice is on a spot when the rejoin comes on

[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:18.040]
There's a little sounder exactly that's right on it anyway. I heard Rick Riley begging shamelessly for something on the area

[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:22.360]
Yesterday if he can do it I'm gonna do it too. What he was begging for some kind of Canadian

[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.380]
beverage some little sodas or something that is sparkling juices or something

[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.100]
Well anyway, you know, I've gone through all the bottled waters

[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:36.700]
I used to love mountain valley and it's still great bottled water, but it has no pizzazz to it. Just it's flat and

[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:41.660]
And I've gotten more into the bubbly fizzing kind of stuff so I can relate to Sally Fitz

[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:46.060]
I can have a bubbling personality and I went through all the Italian waters, which are good now

[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.400]
I'm heavily in this Quabell QI B.E.L

[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.580]
Because anything begins with QI can relate to and it's from sweet

[00:23:53.580 --> 00:24:00.820]
Sweet Springs mountain and the Appalachians in West Virginia. It is great. It's a little fizzy and they have the different little flavors with the

[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.880]
Essence of strawberry or Tangerina whatever I don't think it tastes like anything, but it's good

[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:10.320]
So if anybody listening is connected with the distributors for Quabell, Quabell, whatever the hell it's called

[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.740]
Send me over two 300 cases, okay?

[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:17.540]
Because if Rick Riley can snow around here, I can do it with the best of them mobile on the starline

[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:23.820]
I need to know how you doing great by the way the last time I tried something that you tell it that you there was not a sponsor

[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:28.100]
But you just said it was good was the barks root beer what a great what a great

[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.540]
That was barks diet root beer is even better than the regular

[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:35.100]
The only diet soda in the world that's even better than the regular

[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.280]
I couldn't believe how good it was. Yeah, but anyway, I'm 34 years old

[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:46.240]
So I don't know if I exist or not. Well, you're right on the borderline. I'm a borrower. So I should I don't right that explains

[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.400]
Well, I'm looking to my mirror and I'll see anything. I got a funny story for you

[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.160]
My daughter is seven years old

[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:59.200]
That's pretty funny. Yeah, that is a circle, but she always asked me questions. Why did this fly that I got this book

[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:04.260]
It's called the great big book of why it's like eight inches thick and I've always questioned

[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:11.080]
So I said, okay, you pick out a page and we'll read it. She picks out at random

[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.560]
She opens up the book at random and it says why does the stroke and

[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:22.160]
I said I can't believe this, but you picked it out. I'll read it to you. So I'm reading all this

[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:23.520]
and

[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.380]
And turns out that

[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:30.300]
I love your vocabulary, but half of things you say I don't understand

[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:36.960]
It's talking about apple plexi and now I understand all these are not apple plexi apple plexi

[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.860]
And now I understand what apple plexi is what you get from eating too much fruit. That's right

[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:47.480]
But you're just been saying you've been apple plexic and you're

[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.280]
protecting your own stroke, right? Well, I didn't want to let anybody down, you know

[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.080]
But it was just such an odd thing that as the whole thing folks you pick that out

[00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.720]
Then I want to hear what this is

[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.040]
Anyway, that's my story of matrimaterial. Okay, sir

[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.580]
Have a wonderful life and stroke this

[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.860]
Great listen when we have time someday I'll be delighted to hear your whole life story

[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.920]
Have a good day and a nice life and a great holiday. It's a goodbye

[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.200]
Okay, oh look at we've been putting this one off, but I know it's gonna be the best call of the morning

[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:21.640]
Great

[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:32.520]
You jealous about what I'm hungry and I just can remember those sounds like they have some alone and I'm hungry

[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.260]
Yeah, right

[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.420]
They bring the vat in

[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:42.540]
Johnny dark wouldn't be allowed in to eat and everybody be picking out well

[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:47.360]
It's your last it a long time didn't it three weeks and I was history is the failed experiment

[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:52.460]
My tube is firm and healthy firm and healthy

[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:57.280]
Oh, okay, and on the floor as a matter of fact what they do oh my tube is over in the corner

[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:03.020]
I got it

[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.320]
And Sally says hi to

[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:16.260]
But yeah, so did you like the that live that stuff I sent you it was great. I better not let Alex get a hold of this

[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:22.680]
I would I say Alex I meant uh, what's his name? Al Goldstein. His name could be Alex

[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:28.340]
Yes, hey speaking of Alex. I don't know if anybody told you maybe Rick and Puts did he was on MTV

[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.080]
Yeah, I already talked about that about 20 times. I saw about that. I saw

[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:37.860]
Oh, you saw if I had the ability to do I take you out here right now take your goddamn teeth

[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.080]

He is girl test looking. Yes, sir. You know I had never seen him while I saw him on

[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:50.980]
He's got he's got more wrinkles than granny aug on a bad day and Jeff from pizza loft just came up with tons of food here

[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.460]
Oh, man, I don't have it all set up when mr

[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.220]
Mr. Bouncing ball comes in here in a couple of minutes. Oh, man

[00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.600]
I think I should be going to visit you today just eat all that food

[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.800]
Well, I'm sure glad you're having a nice day all by yourself

[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:11.520]
Have a great life. Oh, yeah, I doubt it dream on take it easy. They'll keep a good grip on your life, sir

[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.460]
You're nobody. Hey, that's great. Okay, wow

[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.740]
Oh, they're all losing it out there. They're losing it and yeah, let's get rid of these empty boxes because Wayne's coming back again

[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:28.520]
How do you like that? This is like a little uh friendly contest that we have here between Jeff from pizza loft and Wayne from Wayne Arnold's

[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.460]
Just almost like in a food frenzy in a little food war

[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.480]
And one of these days when it gets really intense will have them out in the hallway throwing up

[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.140]
Neely burgers and pizzas back and forth that he said ought to be great

[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.940]
So I'm kind of unloading the food for now. Let's al can just eat right out of the big thing there

[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.960]
No problem at all. Look at that the staff comes back in again

[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:54.600]
Isn't this charming to see all these friendly faces including mr. Hussain Jr. There who's got all my ratings figure out and knows that

[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.540]
I'm never making by the end of the year and

[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.780]
Boy, it's just great. Isn't that look at all of this garlic rolls

[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:05.440]
I'm sure it's gonna be great. I want to just tell you this the zini. What did you call it yesterday?

[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:06.880]
The debut form

[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:12.600]
Base eating with mushrooms and meatballs that was I mean everything Jeff has got as great, but that was the best

[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.920]
Food that I've ever had from pizza loft. It was just phenomenal. What?

[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.000]
What does that mean?

[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:24.300]
I don't know. He just gave me like your number one or something. I know what he's talking about

[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:29.760]
But it was just phenomenal and I'm sure this will be too now. There's a couple of pies for Al. I'm sure he'll enjoy those

[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:35.300]
And Wayne is coming back good leave just a little bit for Al Goldstein like that trough that you brought there

[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.460]
Would be good. I might nibble on that but I ate a lot. I really did

[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.720]
I don't know what's gotten into me, but I'm just losing control

[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:46.900]
Okay, let's take a call from for Lauderdale. They will never be there. Hello. You're there. I'm here. I'm line six

[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.620]
This is a shocking experience

[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.000]
How you doing? You mean did you hear any like little ticking while you were holding on?

[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:58.320]
I heard you know your whole show and everything you didn't hear like a little ticking

[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.160]
Maybe like that

[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.940]
Okay, good nothing like that

[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:11.020]
Hey, um, what I never got to hear the radio yesterday because I was inside all day. Yes, sir

[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.320]
What happened at the baseball game? How many people ended up showing up?

[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.240]
3703 to be exact. I mean I wanted to go

[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:24.160]
Hundreds more than showed up for the Cardinals brave game in Atlanta last night. I believe that

[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.300]
And the biggest proud ever at a miracle game by far

[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.520]
3703 it was great. You guys own that's almost capacity, right?

[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.200]
Yeah, I think it holds about 5,000. Oh, jeez well

[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:40.680]
Any I wanted to go so bad, but I had to watch my kids that night because my wife works and and I was like

[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.800]
There's no way I'm taking two little kids, you know what I mean? Why not everybody else did

[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.420]
Well one was I got a 15 month old and a three year old

[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:52.880]
Come on butch up a little bit everybody brings their babies out and their kids and their teenagers and the kids

[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:59.300]
They find on the street. It was great. Well tomorrow is the kind of the same situation my wife's working and you're it's gonna be at the found if you don't come by the

[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.120]
Founds tomorrow never speak to you again

[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.960]
Where's okay? It found just on just out the Howard Maltz on university

[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:11.300]
Right next to cork. You know the fountain shops right next to corkies. You couldn't miss it if you tried okay

[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:18.140]
I'm gonna show up. It's from candle to or no no noon to three. Okay. I'll show up great. Hey, Neil. Do you have to work Monday? Yes, sir

[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.400]

[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.860]
Bring your thing. Okay. See you tomorrow. Bye. Wow

[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.040]
Desperado, I think is the term we use for that

[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.740]
Al Goldstein's ping of desperate will be here. We're gonna watch him eat for two hours right now

[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:38.840]
It's Elaine Etor with the news right Elaine is a wonderful American Rick and suds from Joe Robbie stadium at two the game at eight

[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:44.200]
Rest of market. This is he was used to flowers and hippie stuff lay back that's history

[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:49.760]
That's not the style. No, this is the toughest with aggressive town. I you're always knocking radio. You're right

[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:55.620]
This is I mean when I'm in New York I come back here and I find out who hates everybody the first two hours

[00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:01.300]
It is the most amazing thing. I really think it's management. They want you guys to kill each other. You are likely

[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.880]
It's like a cop fight and then I'm using the clean terms and you know in terms

[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.140]
There's been here what three minutes and he's starting all right

[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:13.340]
But it's like but you guys are like the roosters and you are supposed to main each other

[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:18.740]
It's it's extraordinary and it seems that that's what the public likes. Okay. Murray's back from away in Arnold's by the way

[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.740]
The second they were here already this morning

[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:26.200]
Because we didn't know exactly what time they were gonna get here. So we brought like a refill. I can't believe you came back

[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.660]
That was such an act of kindness. It's wonderful. I bless you

[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:35.560]
In the birch beer in the frosted the plastic cup. I have great pasta and my honey nut Cheerio is on top of it

[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.600]
Oh, that was just mix it all together because it'll all come out the same anyway

[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:43.920]
And it sure I'll get her thing on believable these people how would you like to have people come to your house here?

[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.500]
They just forced feed you wouldn't that be great? I've never had to leave the house. Just hang out at the pool

[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.520]
So to speak how you feeling though? It's just I'm feeling great

[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.400]
I ate too much this morning. I still feel good, but I shouldn't do that

[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.300]
I've avoided doing that and you know I would go into a lecture for you

[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.920]
But to be honest with you it's beyond it is pointless

[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:04.640]
It's pointless because you've dedicated your life to food you said this life here when you were here

[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:09.360]
You've dedicated your life to eating. I wrote you a letter saying that all your fat jokes are true

[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.160]
That I love food to the point of it being self-destructive. I mean just look around this table

[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:18.240]
I'm happy we often make a mess, but this is unbelievable. This is an orgy. I really do

[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:18.660]
I mean I

[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.720]
To have sex now is to ruin a great afternoon

[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.000]
boy barza

[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.360]
And also they have to be an acrobat in your case

[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:32.160]
And to get a dread you know how rickensud you know how sud every day comes on and does the thing where he used to be

[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:37.280]
The horse I missed the red or whatever and I'm kind of I said the other day used to be that big

[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:42.180]
Rover on the prisoner the big ball that used to be on the beach. They used to chase everybody that was you

[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:46.880]
I could tell by the classic. Thank you, Marie you guys are just beyond the way. It's wonderful

[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:51.780]
It is just repeating we have we have a non-stop supply just keep gnashing until two o'clock

[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.940]
This is a dream for a true non-stop supply

[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:56.340]
You didn't know that before

[00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.740]
Now you're you're running for what in brow you're gonna run

[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:05.120]
When is that coming up? It's not for a while. I know I have a while. I'm gonna be in on the on the on the

[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:05.740]
Libertarian

[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:12.360]
I need 18,000 names and it's gonna be an issue where my slogan will be screw crime

[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:19.980]
And basically it's about being left alone whether one is I mean the a sheriff should be fighting crime not not deliver

[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:25.320]
Of songs and I think largest become the laughing stock of the nation. So I'm gonna know

[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:30.540]
That's how I do it. So I'm gonna run against Nick and I really think I have a chance to be in him

[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:35.020]
I think you got a good chance. Yeah, I think your dog can run against it or you got a good chance

[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.940]
When is that gonna be

[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:40.920]
Yeah, the election will be 92

[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:49.600]
So I'm gonna basically I'm gonna announce in a couple of months and then I'm gonna permanently move here to Florida and I'm gonna be just like

[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:55.700]
Kennedy when he ran when he left Massachusetts went to New York City Robert Kennedy

[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:59.380]
And so people may say I'm a cop at bag of but I think that Nick has made

[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]
Florida look ridiculous

[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:07.640]
You've done so much on the on the uptentative censorship that I know in a believer the point but leave the lyrics alone

[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:11.040]
I mean, I don't even like them use it, but I just not just obscenity

[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.460]
But wouldn't it be great to have alcohols in a sheriff of Howard County?

[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:18.040]
Can you imagine the change we get some living and breathing people back in here? That's right

[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:23.400]
Because I think the safest place to be is at a topless club if you were at the dollhouse

[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:29.020]
No one ever gets mugged there you could turn on I mean let's make this place a fun place again

[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:31.080]
Not just for the out the caucus

[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:36.400]
No, we can send them all up to Palm Beach County. Right. We'll have shuttles. We'll have bus shuttles and move them up there

[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.280]
But these meatballs are good. Let's get back to the food because that's all he really cares about

[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:44.520]
Anything else that goes that in between is just to fill okay, we're just filling some time

[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:50.780]
Pete's a lot brought you the ZD with meatballs. What did uh, what did we bring back in from Wayne's?

[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.300]
What did he bring here? Oh, there's white hot? Now are you familiar? Are you into this stuff? No, what a white hot?

[00:35:55.300 --> 00:36:01.380]
Well, I don't want to get you aroused okay, but uh, these are indigenous to Rochester. Oh look at this you brought a whole bunch of

[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:17.580]
And I want you to delay eating one until we come back after the break and then we're gonna have like an exclusive

[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:23.060]
AP and UPI and all the networks might come down here as outgold thing puts his first white hot in his mouth

[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.600]
Right on WIOD this could be exciting

[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:33.060]
Anyway speaking of food it's 1222. I want to tell you about Lottavernetta now if you've ever been at Lottavernetta Mr. Goldstein

[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:36.000]
No, I have no oh jeez now. This is your kind of place

[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.600]
enormous portion

[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.480]
gigantic portions you sit down and bring appetizers they have

[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.980]
Like mushrooms and all kinds of and zucchini and all kinds of good appetizers

[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.240]
I'm sure you're not into that because it's probably too good for it

[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:53.520]
And then they bring soup that you could eat with your fist you can just stick your fist in there

[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.540]
What you can relate to and just pull out all the vegetables and they pasta

[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:02.900]
The pasta for jewel and the minister on it's the best soup in history and while you're doing that you're shoving the garlic bread

[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:07.220]
They have the best garlic bread in history and you're shoving it down piece by piece

[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:12.680]
And then you get ready for the entree and they've got baby cow the best deal in history

[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:17.680]
They have all kinds of great dishes cooked over angel here pasta. Where are they located?

[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.700]
I'm going to get to that in just like it

[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.440]
Why don't you get it tonight? I know they don't open no five you can eat till two and then they

[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.760]
air out on the way over there and have it in a red fire

[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:32.060]
I have my cheerios a great chicken and seafood and everything like you're having pasta now the best pasta and then angel here

[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:36.580]
They have like dishes where they put veal and peppers and onions all over the angel here pasta tremendous

[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:40.600]
And then when you're finished with that they have a dessert cart that they bring by

[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:45.080]
And they have like that turumasoo and all these great desserts and by the time you're finished there

[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:48.340]
You're you could probably last till morning in your case which is saying a lot

[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.420]
It really is great

[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:53.460]
So if you want to go out this weekend for a great Italian dinner make a reservation it's small

[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:58.540]
It's intimate and if it all is in there it'll take up half the restaurant seven two two eighteen thirty one

[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:03.160]
They're at eighty four fifty five west McNabb road and Tamarack they're not far from you at all

[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:08.960]
You're up in pop it all they're in Tamarack. I'm gonna be the Saturday night. I'm just slightly east of Pine Island on McNabb road

[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:13.680]
You can't beat it. It's just fantastic. Tell Carol then the Al Goldstein that they don't want to be the promise

[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.080]
Outstanding Lotta Bernetta

[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.260]
Al Goldstein's here. That's his pet pig you really do have a pet and don't say what you said about

[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.960]
Started I'm telling you I almost breathed all over the table all over the mic that was the most gross

[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.640]
Thing, I'll be safe something like but the miniature

[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:45.100]
Oh, it's a miniature pig no that was now up to 35 pounds patty and I gonna give it away because he's he's too big and they really are not

[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:48.440]
I don't think you could give it away patty. Yes, but I'm thinking you're

[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:53.800]
Pissed adorable anyway here now. This is the little thing we want to do on here before we get into the heavy sexual content

[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.560]
Because I know you do okay. I went in front of you on rapid

[00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.520]
Can you handle that with your short grubby hands in front of your gigantic puppet?

[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:04.340]
I'm kind of this man. He may be fat, but he is the classiest dresser

[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:10.480]
He wore a t-shirt almost the same one. Yeah mutilation with the kids head hanging is really the guy

[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:16.620]
Some guy a young guy. I then look like a bratwurst. Okay. Okay. Looks like a bratwurst now take before you get his terror

[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.320]
I know it's hard for you to wait and don't mongol over our equipment the engineering staff of Oak Creek

[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.620]
That's it take a little for put that's Wayne Arnold's hot sauce

[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:28.940]
Okay, there's a place in Rochester called Don and Bob's where you'll probably be tomorrow by the way after you're about this

[00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:33.940]
This is wonderful radio and this is where they started with the white hots and they're indigenous to upstate New York

[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.740]
And now the way to me is taking in his hand

[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:42.860]
He's got a gigantic smile on his face and if it puts that in his mouth to keep it an animal. There he goes

[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.300]
He's biting into it

[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:50.620]
The sauce is sliming all down his shirt over the mutilation thing. It looks like blood off the kids neck back there with a rope

[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:51.800]
Is it incredible?

[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.980]
And loaded with fat too. I just want to mention that to you. It's my cholesterol very good

[00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:01.240]
It's delicious. Did I had my stroke? I had three of those. I just want you to know that but they're delicious

[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:07.300]
There's Rame Arnold's royal castle now on your way back when the limo takes you back north

[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:14.120]
You get on i95 and right at the 125th Street exit, which is right up the street. It's about 36 blocks

[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:19.940]
By by 230 you'll be ready. Yeah, 125th Street exit you get off. It's a block. It's right off

[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.580]
125th so it's easy to get on the expressway easy off and you go and then they got

[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:26.720]
Neely burgers, which are a little bacon cheese burgers. We're off castle

[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.940]
You remember there was white castle and royal castle and it's the original thing and now he brought these in from Rochester

[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.720]
Because I've been talking about them for years. The greatest thing you've ever had in your mouth

[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.000]
Easily you're not gonna have see she doesn't eat

[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:43.320]
Then they what is she do she watch you we all day? Is that all that goes on in your house?

[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.260]
She sits around to watch you eat all day

[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:50.580]
I mean the audience thinks this is sick. It's not sick. The man is just he's just a human garbage

[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.800]
Are you wearing those those compounds today that you wearing the last time? It is a pretty

[00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:01.800]
In very beautiful color coordinated so I started to say at the ball game the other night outcomes on and he's wearing a t-shirt

[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.140]
That's got like mom

[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:08.580]
It'll in other words you're covered yourself. He's such a slob that when he eats it stuff always who he goes on

[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:13.620]
He gets t-shirts that already have the stains on him. Okay, so he's color coordinated to start with the man is incredible

[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:18.960]
All right, now let's talk some raw sex. This is great. This is better than the sex, you know

[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.640]
What's on the open tooth?

[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.980]
They're never close. They're even open on Tisha Bob. They're never you. I thought you were listening to this show

[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:26.680]
I thought you were

[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:32.380]
Make that up the mother people up out. I don't think you've ever heard this show

[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:35.200]
I mean he's in here giving a song and that's about how to explain it

[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:40.080]
Does the man have talent or what is he lost it? I don't want to get either way an intensive thing about that

[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.840]
But this audience despises the man with a passion. You do understand this. I think you have talent

[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:47.960]
I think once upon a time I need two nests. How old is he 60? No, I'm not

[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:53.400]
How I was sitting was he remember every year every day? Yeah, he had that disease where you keep getting young wherever he's six months

[00:41:53.400 --> 00:42:00.900]
Is that a total of the main fifty five fifty four fifty four fifty five? How old is it?

[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.360]
Fifty fifty eight bounces around like a ball. I can't believe it

[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:07.420]
So at least fifty right because when he left here it was only 44

[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:12.040]
But when you go to San Francisco you age a lot because there's a lot of stress and a lot of pressure out there

[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:16.400]
From all the fishers including the ones in the earthquake. No, I think Alex is good

[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.960]
I think it's a good show. I really do. What is a good show? What do you think you know?

[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.120]
He did here was a good show with pen now when it was nasty

[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.660]
But I think when he had comedians and it was it was a great

[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:30.700]
You didn't like that I thought I'll look for them, but it's desperation for the audience because in this town

[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.640]
How many good comedians are there? Oh, I will say and I'll give them all the credit

[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.480]
That Eric Lambert he can thank him you didn't have to thank me or Rick and suds

[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.940]
He can thank him because nobody would have ever heard him or born for Alex and those corny shows

[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:46.300]
If I had the ability to do I take you out here right now kick your goddamn teeth in all right

[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.620]
You don't want to get the hucka chanic about him because he's dead meat in this market

[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:53.600]
He's backing his own realm. There are people who are big in a given town

[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.920]
Okay, Jerry Williams in Boston. They love me. He's been there for a hundred years

[00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:02.000]
Alex in San Francisco for whatever bizarre reason they like him out there and that's where this is waiting

[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.860]
Have you look at look at that here?

[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:09.220]
Mr. punk Marvin. I can't believe it look at that

[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.740]
I just can't he looks like a different person doesn't he?

[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.460]
No, no, you look great. I can't believe it especially since it's you. I just can't get over it

[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:27.120]
Anyway, let's talk about Gloria Gloria Leonard. It's really um which the Gloria is bisexual

[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:32.660]
Yeah, is that a shock is that a major news bullet? Is that what that is?

[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:36.520]
I know the man you love is Ron Cheromy. He is really the ugliest man in the business

[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.060]
He's frightened. Well the only thing he's got going is he's double-jointed

[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:41.880]
I don't want to get graphic because I don't want them to come back to me next week

[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.460]
See we told you don't put them on it's a pornographic show

[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:55.720]
I've ever seen can you explain that to me? I think I think you and I want to discuss this before but it's long ago

[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.900]
And my mind's still wonders. I mean not everybody could look like Peter North. Okay. We're like

[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.420]
Bambi Woods

[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:06.920]
All right, you know, that's an amazing thing because I have good taste regardless of what it is my eyes are very good

[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.920]
Now Bambi Woods who is Debbie does deer field she was big

[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:17.080]
But these guys when they talk about female porn stars they never talk about her. I don't understand it. It's beautiful

[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:21.520]
I don't know. Yeah, she's got everything. She's got all the right plays and things in her right places

[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.700]
She's young she's beautiful

[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:29.660]
He's blonde and they talk about some of these really marginal people like Vanessa Del Rio for exactly. She looks like a poor authority

[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.680]
slut. I mean, I'm absolutely unattractive

[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:36.520]
I find her eternal. Yeah, gross

[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.020]
And like Gloria Leonard looks like a little old

[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:47.580]
Gloria Boehm she was just 50 less but she's always looked old but she's good actress and a nice lady and and Ron Jeremy like you said

[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:52.100]
Ron is frightening right and there are a lot of other guys. There's another guy his name is our Bola

[00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:59.280]
Oh, you know, I know it's grotesque wide and I may have realized today like people go and they buy these things and they watch him at home and

[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:04.160]
The pretend they don't see him but like in the days when porn was big which is long gone with his history

[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:13.760]
Uh 80% of the people who are in those splits were all ugly. True. Why do they believe that most people want to go see ugly people have sex?

[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:19.260]
The men are in the mirror and do that. Well, I know the theory is and I'm not gonna justify it

[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:26.720]
Is that men go for the women and all you want the male to do is be reliable in terms of a sexual context

[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:31.940]
But most of the men are ugly are Bola. I wanted to interview for screw magazine and he said no

[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:36.440]
Be to see how the legitimate acting career. I said but I said I said

[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:42.140]
Resor Robbins you are there naked doing it on screen you think people don't know who you are and he's afraid

[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:46.100]
I would ruin his legitimate career. There are real delusions here

[00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:51.200]
That are almost almost psychotic. Oh, there are a couple of like Jamie Gillis is another one

[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:56.060]
He considers himself a real actor you can tell because all the scripts of these pathetic movies

[00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:01.820]
You used to be in a real deep and real like they were really trying to do something with a message like they consider them

[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:08.700]
So great Shakespeare and actors who the hell are they kidding and he's another one me. I mean so ugly and so grotesque

[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:13.060]
Had he liked them. She thinks he's a nice Jamie Gillis

[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:17.620]
Can you put her on a mic? Oh, we'll give her a mic if you won't give you equal time. Do we have one?

[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:21.520]
I can choose or can't wait. She's sitting down in front of a white hot. Maybe that'll work. I don't know

[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.020]
This way I can see what is all huh?

[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:28.800]
Talk what in oh here it is over here. I can't see it in the middle of all the photo. Okay. Excuse me George

[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:34.080]
What the hell was that? Okay, it was my zoom tube is getting excited. Okay, so just try to relax

[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.660]
Okay, here we go. Is it on?

[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:43.660]
Okay, that's why I like his informal radio. See it was never like this with Alex before it was a little more plastic

[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:47.220]
Jamie Gillis is no, maybe you're gonna have to pull that up

[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.960]
We're gonna have to really like you're gonna

[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.820]
In what respect what is it is like from the navel down?

[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:53.860]
Beautiful

[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.100]
Jamie Gillis is beautiful. No, why do you marry now?

[00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:00.380]
My god, what's the last time you had your eyes checked? Are you serious?

[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:02.120]
How sick are those glasses?

[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:06.600]
Oh, geez god. There's hope for everybody now man

[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.100]
She said I looked almost as good as Peter North. I couldn't believe

[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:13.920]
Guys, yeah, aren't those beautiful and for the right price you can have through a few thousand

[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:18.360]
Anyways 1235 at WIOD. We're here for the outgroating two hour lunch

[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:22.400]
That's the only reason the show is going on all the rest is just feel and we'll be right back

[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:32.140]
What a great dog boy look at that. She's gonna do something on the table there. That'll be great

[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.600]
uh 1238 at WIOD and

[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:40.660]
Yeah, we're talking about during the break about continental cable which I would like to take an hour through a slamman

[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:48.260]
Some cable companies went in rains they have a problem the cable goes out for 20 minutes with continental when a pigeon flies over and lets a leg

[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:51.820]
The cable goes out for at least an hour or some time an hour and a half last

[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:55.040]
Either last year or the year before when I think I was

[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:59.340]
Had my first dish on a Sunday during the NFL playoffs

[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:04.100]
continental cable went out at about 11 30 in the morning and luckily I had my dish

[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.080]
So didn't bother me

[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:09.800]
But they were out for hours and I think it was a day on a Sunday when they had an AFC game

[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:16.080]
And known NFC game at four o'clock in the afternoon and people in that whole area must have been going nuts because they could see nothing

[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:20.640]
Because when you got the cable you usually don't even have a regular antenna that's it. That's what you depend on

[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:27.580]
The worst I was looking I'm a news junkie and I was watching CNN which is a headline news

[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:31.240]
was channel eight and all of a sudden in black and zannis

[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:38.660]
What happened and then I find out that between the hours of 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. They changed the station line up

[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:43.080]
and and headline news has now become 32 but they never told the subscribers

[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:49.540]
They don't care last night I was watching prime time a fascinating article a fascinating story on

[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.520]
William styron the writer about his depression

[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:58.180]
10 away. I'm in gross in it goes off the year for 46 minutes. They don't care

[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:05.720]
I have a satellite in New York City. I'm gonna put a satellite edition on at my condo. I just think we're too mid-night blue and brown

[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:12.520]
But you know the big bad for going on in New York City now they're trying to knock out the sex shows and Manhattan

[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:17.820]
J which is the station that always had the sex stuff is post-war theater. I told the first in fact

[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.600]
I'm gonna be doing Donnie even next week about that topic

[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:25.500]
But it's not a Florida story the point is come but it ties in with all the Florida stories

[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:30.760]
You know the American ecstasy things started in where was it in the enemy self in Louisiana or Alabama some general

[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:36.980]
in Alabama and and all of a sudden once they got it off it's off all together not that

[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:42.240]
Anybody cares because quite frankly all the movies they showed I've seen 400 times right most of them don't want to see again

[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:45.160]
But it's just the idea of people having the free choice

[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.820]
They've got a lock-out box little kids aren't gonna see it

[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:51.920]
But it just got these far missing the right wingers who want to take away everything

[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:55.660]
I I joke about it about all the fastest and about you know the Nazi

[00:49:56.100 --> 00:50:00.620]
Doitsland abroad us ought to be the theme song and brown and and everybody grabs and bitches the same thing

[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:02.420]
But it's a big joke to them. They don't care

[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:06.820]
I do listen to you and of course I am in New York so I can't hear you there

[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:11.740]
When I'm here I listen and when I love about you and the night I love your nancyness

[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:13.640]
You're I mean I just the great boy

[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:18.380]
And the witty the true is great the wise make-up even if you were a stuttering

[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:21.200]
Daughtering old fool the one mad which I will be in about a half hour

[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.680]
But what I love about you and and it's not it's not a kang you

[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:30.320]
It should go down to the fundamentals which is I really am an atheist and I think the issues are atheism versus

[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:36.700]
The Puridans the Puridans left England came here. It really had to come to appearance called the hypocrites the hypocrite

[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:39.060]
That's what they are they want to feel guilty

[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:43.940]
To me pornography is irrelevant except that it's right to exist is important

[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:47.300]
I'm not going to say pornography is important. There's a genre who cares

[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.380]
But it should be an option available

[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:53.180]
I am an atheist and every time I hear these people's tapping pornography

[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:58.020]
It's people who want to go to Sunday school Bible classes. Let them. I don't close the day of church

[00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:00.060]
Let them leave my copulous clubs alone

[00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:06.580]
What why is it that the Europeans are so far ahead of us? I go you know the last two summers for the I don't want sound like a great world

[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:11.160]
Travel because I'm not but my first two trips to Europe were last summer when I had a great two weeks

[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.160]
Then this year I cut a jerk as my health wasn't that great

[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:17.340]
But they're like light years ahead of us. They're not all uptight about sex

[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.920]
If you want to see any kind of pornography under the sun. They've got it

[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:25.820]
If you don't want to see it nobody's been drag you in they don't even talk about it because it's past say it's old ahead

[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:30.760]
It's not a big sim is they don't have a bunch of Puritans running around they have a church on every street corner

[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:35.100]
But they're all empty nobody even that they don't they don't have the same outlook on

[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:40.780]
fanatic religion on in intolerance and trying to tell everybody how to live their lives think of it in terms of the

[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:46.700]
the Puritans and the true believe that came here to this country a new beach in Europe who cares

[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:50.240]
The television shows breasts nobody cares. We are so

[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.960]
fixated and that I believe

[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:57.540]
I would not have made the money I did with screw but we're so fixated

[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:02.040]
They were so much guilt. I mean masturbation is still offensive to some people

[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:10.760]
We don't stand a chance. I mean it's absolutely extraordinary that people still fight these sex issues let it be who cares about a new

[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:12.160]
Beach

[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:18.420]
You're right about the religious thing and you know and I don't want to get into a whole thing about it because I've done 80,000

[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:23.000]
The shows on that over the years when I've used the screen and fear my gut sound and it might well been whistling it

[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:26.440]
But you know, he's got the gay rights thing coming up

[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:37.080]
The band that you should just going to statement and the archbishop over here up this street and his 80 billion dollar office

[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:41.720]
With all you know, we have every year we raise money for Kamala's house because people are starving

[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:45.840]
And we do our little bit and people out there take their harder and dollars and try to help out

[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:49.660]
But here they spend millions of dollars so that the archbishop can sit up there in fancy quarters

[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:55.200]
And he sends out his little victim that they should vote against the thing and all the religious intolerant

[00:52:55.200 --> 00:53:00.640]
Bigot and for the Catholic Church to be talking about homosexuality is it is like would be like you giving a lecture on

[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:05.300]
overeating. I mean, right incredible read aids among Catholic priests very high numbers

[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:07.380]
There are constant religious

[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:13.080]
Candles the bottom line is it really is when I do a college appearance or a good TV show now

[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:19.280]
I always go right into the fact that I'm an atheist and it's the fact that religion wants us to feel guilty

[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:26.180]
They want to delay pleasure. They say everything is is is for the hair after it is supposed to be a veil of tears

[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:27.920]
And it really is

[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.620]
Religion which is promulgating superstition and nonsense

[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:37.960]
But I don't try to close up the religions leave my topless clubs and point out that it is alone and for Nick

[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.480]
And then that's really why I want to run

[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:44.180]
For sure for Nick to be listening to lyrics when this is the most dangerous

[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:48.900]
Community in the world is is is is truly the definition of abstentity

[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.580]
It wants to be a thick tear you want to sit up there and die

[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:57.760]
What it's the same like a crap we went through with the FCC here. You know, they're worried about words

[00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:03.160]
They're worried about somebody whoever got offended by work. I'm not offended, but whoever got harmed by words

[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:08.200]
So you get offended big did you turn it off you can block it out, but I don't see where anybody gets hurt by words

[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.280]
Absolutely, absolutely. I was watching channel nine which is spent here

[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:13.780]
On the continental

[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:16.820]
system and they had some discussion

[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:23.000]
And the people who were attacking at the time was a show about table TV in New York City

[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:29.620]
The people who were offended by the pro-dex programs where people can even speak English they said you these people

[00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:34.820]
They people who never read Shakespeare never read a book don't know who does the F skis is

[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:40.240]
Again and again instead of of of enjoying the fact that we are diverse society

[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:46.740]
We constantly try to homogenize things patty and I were in Berlin a year ago before the wall came down

[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:50.580]
And I hate to say the ships. I hate Berlin. I don't like Cuba

[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:55.640]
Hate Russia because it's boring and because it's pure tanical because it's pure tanical

[00:54:55.640 --> 00:55:01.140]
And when the walls came down the first thing to East Berlin people did was not to was not to buy time magazine

[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:05.260]
They ran to the porno shops in West Berlin. That's what they were stopped for

[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:09.020]
That's what makes democracy so important and it's funny

[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:12.440]
There'll be more freedom in Russia probably next year than we have here in Florida

[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.780]
But but to go back to the art spaceship the ones who scream the most

[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:19.260]
Just like the ones who are now carrying on about the ordinance on Tuesday

[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:23.500]
Almost always are self-hating closities. You're right my whole life

[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:30.600]
I've discovered that under the Joe McCarthy's and the J of your hoover's and the Roy Cohn's and all these who just died a couple years ago

[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:32.020]
horrible death for me right right

[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:37.800]
Hippocrates self-hating hypocrites and Jimmy Swagherts and

[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:42.100]
Fallwell and Jim Baker who's cooling his heels up there. All

[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:48.180]
condemning and making judgment and making a fast buck off it to at the same time because they're feeding on people's

[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:52.640]
insecurity and our hatreds and their fears and their guilt and in the meantime they're doing everything

[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:58.980]
That's walking that's breathing that's a key concept of of of hypocrisy when I testified at the Weas Commission five years

[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:07.320]
So I looked up at this dour sour face of a guy named Bruce with him now he he runs an organization in New York called Covenant House

[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:11.440]
He hated pornography, but what he also did he was a pedophile

[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:16.140]
He was involved with young shitties. It all been proven he's fired. He may even face criminal charges

[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:20.600]
This man looked at me like I was some via leper police. I'm honest

[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:25.520]
I'm consistent with my convictions. I don't put down people for the things I'm doing

[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:32.040]
That's what Bruce ridded it. That's what I hate about the churches. You do carnal o'cona. Oh a carnal o'belmond

[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:32.860]
Do you have these?

[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:38.580]
I'm carnal o'belmond talk about a hypocrite as well documented that he was homosexual not only that

[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:42.880]
But that they used to have young boys who were brought off in limousines in the back door of the rectory or whatever

[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:46.600]
It's all where he was living. I mean and but I say that rectory

[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:51.660]
I'm very very carefully the rectum re right it's a 1248 out gold scenes here

[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:55.800]
I'm glad we got him into a real heated conversation because it we took a little break and a little

[00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:01.720]
I'm digesting exactly you can hear it if you listen carefully you can hear the digesting going on and else perfect listen

[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:06.160]
Oh, that's exciting. It's almost for a graphic and we'll do a little break

[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:10.060]
I'm gonna keep him on his best behavior. He's not gonna take another mouthful to the least nine minutes

[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:11.260]
We'll be right back

[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:20.220]
If I had the ability to do I take you out here right now. Check your goddamn teeth

[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:24.880]
Well listen. I want to keep his memory alive. I want to make you happy 1252 at wiov

[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.080]
I'll go since you're not forget Rick and smut will be at

[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:32.380]
Joe Robbie I'm a city orange for am I getting older what Joe Robbie Stadium doing their show this afternoon

[00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:33.520]
They've dick part you know

[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:39.780]
This park is older than both of us put together and he looks like the posted child for a teenage

[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:44.040]
Purple cream or something. It looks great. He does maybe he'll reveal his secret

[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:49.820]
I'm here they all I think he's showing for some show that he's doing now and the daughter and cheerleaders Jennifer and Mary

[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:55.460]
Soon probably to be posted show in and school magazine will be on four o'clock this afternoon Tim Robby will be on the show

[00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:59.820]
Joe's a ganky at five o'clock and of course after sports talk at all times at a bike from Zeta clock

[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:03.180]
You showed up at the game you know about are you a baseball fan? No, I

[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:08.740]
I showed up these but I did buy season passes. They were tuna knowledge and I bought did you really?

[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:10.920]
Does I wanted to be part of the community?

[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:15.300]
But the food was good. I like the way they grilled the hot dogs out there

[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.440]
I mean that was serious grilling it was done on the griddle

[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:22.100]
When he first got here off the air he said you were right

[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:27.800]
I did eat the whole rest of the time because you were sitting back there and it was I felt great because I'm sandwiched

[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:31.340]
To you and fair rich and people said man you lost so much weight you look great

[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:37.940]
I lost the hunt sitting between you guys next thing I know you get up and you had some lame excuse

[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:44.000]
What did you say you were like I think I said I said I'm in the school no no you said you wanted to see the game or something

[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.920]
You know

[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:51.180]
Totally bogus and you're not full of me and I said well you know the food is about how did you mention it?

[00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:54.800]
And you were over there the whole night. Yeah, I said they broke all the records for food sales

[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:58.780]
It wasn't because of the big it is good and it wasn't a rip off. I like that. It's nice

[00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:01.220]
So you'll just go out there and eat food every night. Why?

[00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:02.260]
During the season next day

[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:04.700]
It's okay for Mike Vex said it's okay

[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:10.120]
You know his father was a real hero of mine. He and should be in the baseball hall of fame. Absolutely

[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:13.000]
You're not a sports fan of yours. No one you're a friend of ours

[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.300]
I used to I used to love the Brooklyn Dodges and when they left Brooklyn I cried I know things

[00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:22.080]
Babel's lifetime batting average is three-four

[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:27.580]
Garages three-four and they some memory that when I was four years old man. Oh, yeah

[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:32.560]
I think you were statistics Hank Bauer and Bobby O'Villard and all this

[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:36.300]
I didn't know Bob color was the right hand to throw I blew that in the year. I never heard the end of

[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.860]
Have you always been in into flush racing

[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:41.580]
30 years and I've learned nothing

[00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:44.680]
I've learned absolutely nothing said maybe stay away

[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:50.200]
Do you ever go? No, I just can't see you with the track. Although I will say this if you go up to call

[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:57.260]
The racing is lounging but the food is insane. What do they say? I could take you up on the fourth floor at call in the clubhouse

[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.660]
They make a

[00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:05.200]
And deli sandwich the best deli sandwiches of the fresh corn beef for strami roast beef and Swiss on big rolls

[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.620]
You would go nuts

[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:10.720]
Forget about the race. You're only once every half-all-eat where you look out the window

[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.060]
You have some passing

[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:18.160]
What is it most places in the world you cannot get a rare hamburger?

[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:21.020]
I mean, this has been my cause now. I want to want an answer

[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.860]
As I could say because most people don't like it wrong

[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:28.260]
So I would want but I was saying that you could be a very rare blood rare

[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:32.800]
It can do with most places and not do a rare forever. I find it amazing. I mean, this is the

[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.900]
Ultimate frustration in my life. I hope you keep reading that the movie was already

[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:40.440]
Leonard that caused this fixation with eating things raw. Is that what I mean?

[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.640]
Do you remember the movie I'm talking about?

[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.920]
No, which one was it? You don't remember the movie I'm talking about?

[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.060]
You were sitting

[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.220]
I don't remember when it was naked or whatever

[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:52.620]
Three years point of gravity back here about one. If anything should be banned

[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:53.820]
They should be it as you naked

[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:58.680]
But and you were like doing a commentary and then there were all these things going on in between

[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:01.860]
But you and Gloria Leonard was sitting there. I don't know what the hell it was about

[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:04.640]
But you were in it. You were very prominent in this movie. You don't remember it?

[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.380]
I remember it.

[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:06.960]
Cheers. I think

[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.440]
That's the one on the set they had chicken wings

[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:14.340]
Oh

[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:14.880]
God

[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.480]
So what are all these people doing?

[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:17.760]
I don't know. Let me ask you this.

[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:20.740]
Because this is a very important question. A lot of people are asking to ask you

[01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:21.700]
John Holmes

[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:24.120]
John was a prosthetic or was it so?

[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.580]
No, it was real. You know, I covered his emergency trial for playboy

[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:30.640]
And when people would tell me this well

[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:34.180]
I would talk about other now. I know Patty's not gonna tell me he was the working man.

[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.640]
He was from hunger

[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.480]
But I heard of the one of the obvious people that was ever born

[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.900]
But I wouldn't give him my right on him

[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.440]
No, no

[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.900]
No, Jewish sites feel that

[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.740]
But I understand. But living he was incredible

[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:50.700]
But he was as you know by textual and he was a very heavy drug user

[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:52.700]
Very heavy drug user

[01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:53.820]
This could be cocaine

[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.140]
He died two years ago, baby

[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:00.300]
Gloria Leonard is my neighbor in LA, you know

[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.180]
And she and the Dawson and the Vikings

[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:04.880]
Are we doing a show or is she like that?

[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:06.740]
She's up and also what is this thing?

[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.600]
Is he having a hormonal problem? What year are we?

[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.060]
I don't know if they have this confusion

[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.040]
Or I never think about a much better way

[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.160]
I know this thing about me

[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.640]
And maybe he's giving it back

[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:17.500]
He's kidding

[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:35.640]

Oh boy, it's the one to two hours

[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:05.820]
Summer 1990 is the summer of Dick Tracy

[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.060]
You'll see the movie

[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:08.140]
Listen to the soundtrack

[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:10.420]
Wear the t-shirt and read the comic book

[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.900]
And now just in time for Father's Day

[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.260]
You can enjoy the fragrance that was inspired by the movie

[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.180]
The soundtrack the t-shirt in the comic book

[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:20.200]
New Dick Tracy Cologne

[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:22.220]
Why smell like other guys?

[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:24.560]
Now you can smell like Dick

[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.640]
Okay 106-WYOD

[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:29.880]
Slim Al Goldstom is here puffing on a little stokey

[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.180]
We're having

[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.800]
See some people after sex

[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.680]
They have a little smoke

[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:34.000]
Al after each course

[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.580]
Has another stokey

[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.800]
Which is what about your fourth since you came in and went on

[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.640]
And it better bad

[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:43.080]
And you know this I keep a very clean mirror right over the food

[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.660]
So I'm double as excited

[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.080]
That's the turn on for me

[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.100]
People would come to my home

[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:51.020]
When I was dating before I married Patty

[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:53.500]
And they'd say it'd be a mirror over the bedroom

[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.500]
No, there's a lot of refrigerators in the bedroom

[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:56.360]
Food

[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.700]
You are gonna stop though

[01:03:58.700 --> 01:03:59.660]
I'm not gonna stop on the break

[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:00.240]
I'm doing the break

[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:00.980]
I'm working

[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:03.680]
We're working desperately with Al to try to bring it back to the police

[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.360]
I'm out of the drug

[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:07.920]
I maintain and then I think Neil agrees with with this

[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:11.100]
That food is to me and to him

[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.360]
The way cocaine is to a drug user

[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.160]
I get it

[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:14.520]
It's a victim

[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:15.340]
It really is

[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:15.960]
I used to go there

[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:18.340]
Well nothing worse than skinny people who eat like pigs

[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:19.520]
And have never had a way problem

[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.200]
You know what I mean you're lame

[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:21.500]
And uh

[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.280]
But they don't appreciate food the way we do

[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.400]
My chick's the wife

[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.080]
Will eat tuna fish sandwiches

[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.340]
She doesn't know good food

[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:29.620]
I mean uh

[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:30.580]
She pees too

[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:31.300]
Probably um

[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:31.580]
Yeah

[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:35.880]
No one to me go to her is mashed potatoes with gravy

[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.400]
She loves

[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.220]
She loves McDonald's

[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:39.820]
I mean to her

[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:42.440]
I mean to her this is going main food

[01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:44.960]
But when she's probably healthy with food

[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.280]
Food is something she just eats

[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:46.780]
But I

[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.960]
Dream about it

[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:48.860]
I get excited

[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:50.600]
I get mesmerized by food

[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.220]
And you do have so with Dom Delory

[01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:53.620]
It was painful to movie

[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:54.320]
Wasn't it?

[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:54.680]
Yeah

[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:55.660]
Because I thought it was funny

[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:57.980]
I mean I get moments that you're gonna relate to

[01:04:57.980 --> 01:04:58.820]
But I thought it was funny

[01:04:58.820 --> 01:04:59.720]
There's so much pesos

[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.200]
I kept identifying with the part

[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:02.640]
Embedded night

[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.360]
And he's

[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.520]
Flicks through the TV

[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.600]
And every channel has got another spot

[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:07.780]
The hates are in the cheese

[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:09.180]
And oh god

[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:10.000]
It's so relatable

[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.580]
It is so relatable

[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:12.500]
Should we take

[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:13.380]
Do you think we're gonna get some

[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.460]
Cosper algolds today

[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:15.420]
Maybe some good

[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:16.780]
Maniacs

[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:17.580]
We get some hate

[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.580]
Not like the old days is it

[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.200]
See it's like when I used to have

[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.440]
Madeline or hair on all the time

[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.440]
And in the beginning

[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.520]
Changed to get all these religious nuts

[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.160]
That would call

[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:26.560]
And they would

[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.540]
Spue their hate and show what good religions

[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.140]
And then after like the

[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:31.000]
400th time

[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.100]
You wear them down

[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:33.700]
You wear down the resistance

[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:35.600]
And they just give up

[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.620]
Because they know that you're not gonna go away

[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:39.100]
And you're not gonna stop telling the truth

[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:39.540]
Right

[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.640]
And they can't handle it

[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:41.840]
Uh

[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:42.860]
Lantana

[01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:44.000]
Yeah, ow

[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:44.560]
Hi

[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.640]
You also critique films for Penn House magazine

[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.280]
Yes, they do a monthly column for Penn House

[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.760]
And a monthly column for Forum

[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:52.580]
Oh okay

[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:53.720]
Now I was just warning

[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.300]
Could you like

[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.740]
Give like the top five top films

[01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:57.980]
That are

[01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:59.520]
You know have some kind of plot

[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.360]
Because you know

[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.460]
You watch some

[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:02.460]
You go into a

[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:04.040]
Into a video store

[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.160]
And you're walking around trying to find out

[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.280]
A good film

[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.680]
Let me wait a minute

[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:08.960]
Wait a minute

[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:09.040]
Wait a minute

[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:09.220]
Wait a minute

[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:09.420]
You see

[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:09.820]
In other words

[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:10.720]
A good film to your good

[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.240]
Porto film has to have a plot

[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.280]
Well not a plot

[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.040]
But you know

[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.040]
Now where a girl comes in

[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.280]
Rough front-hand motion

[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.180]
All of a sudden they're in 2069

[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:19.600]
You know

[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.340]
You want something

[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:22.760]
That has a buildup of characters

[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:23.640]
You know where

[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:24.620]
Not where

[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:25.300]
In other words

[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.720]
You want 60 through 68

[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:27.180]
Right

[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:29.780]
Which by the way is the important thing

[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:31.720]
Because it's the tease that makes it work

[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:33.060]
I mean you're absolutely right

[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:33.520]
Just

[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:36.020]
Just having people do it is tedious

[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:36.740]
And not boring

[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:38.860]
I think that's the exciting thing about

[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:40.260]
Dating is

[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:42.340]
I mean there is attention

[01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:44.420]
To just do it right away

[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:44.880]
Is it

[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:45.880]
I mean I think boring

[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.180]
I think totally boring

[01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:50.100]
I want to talk mostly about the older films

[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:51.620]
One is called Sex World

[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:53.300]
Which is really a well done

[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:55.720]
Slick film is a film called

[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.560]
To boo

[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:00.080]
I haven't really made that agree with these thoughts

[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:02.940]
Jerry Domiano some people say it can be pretentious

[01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:06.100]
But I think the devil in this Jones is wonderful

[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:06.480]
Yeah

[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.840]
You know what

[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:07.900]
Oh

[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:09.060]
Yeah

[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:09.700]
Hate it

[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:11.620]
You know that if you eat too many of those white hops

[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:12.880]
It starts affecting the brain

[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.220]
All the fat starts flagulating under the veil

[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:15.980]
You know what I mean

[01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:17.620]
The devil in this Jones

[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:20.960]
The only movie worse than that was Deep Stroke

[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.240]
Would you everybody talk about

[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.020]
What the worst

[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:24.220]
Port movies ever made

[01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:24.700]
It's a funny

[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:25.320]
What is

[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.380]
Deep Stroke

[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:26.760]
Funny

[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:27.480]
Yeah it's funny

[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.320]
But not erotic

[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:28.740]
Oh no

[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:29.300]
You know at least

[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:29.640]
No

[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:32.260]
It's also a Harry Reams another ugly Jewish guy with hair

[01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.260]
Right exactly

[01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:34.580]
But devil in this Jones

[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:35.880]
Now here's the test

[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:38.040]
By I mean we rent a film devil in this Jones

[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:38.760]
And realize

[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.100]
Who is the genius

[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:42.220]
I, I'll go steam on Neil Rogers

[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:44.440]
And you'll see why I'm running for Sheriff and he's not

[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.040]
We know it's going to be you

[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.400]
Yeah I know why

[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.280]
I'm springing for lunch and he's eating it

[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:52.100]
Because you know

[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:54.260]
A lot of people tend to get ripped off

[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:55.440]
They just go in there and

[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.900]
Read my reviews in pen house

[01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:57.300]
Seriously

[01:07:57.860 --> 01:07:58.460]
The valuable

[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.280]
The problem is most of the films are so boring

[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:00.940]
That I'd look them

[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:02.100]
I looked them in video

[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:04.920]
And I go fast forward during the sex scenes

[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:05.780]
Because it all looks alike

[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:07.840]
And I only stop it for the dialogue

[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.340]
To see if there's anything sane

[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:11.480]
Most porn films are pathetic

[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:12.100]
Right

[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:14.200]
And there are no scripts

[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.240]
Right I have to agree with the acting

[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.200]
And it tends to

[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:18.520]
You know

[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:19.900]
The business

[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:23.520]
I mean so I'll find that there's more bad films coming out now

[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:23.980]
Yeah

[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:26.660]
And then the quality films like you say

[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:28.600]
It's even the beauty older ones

[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.420]
Where you know

[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:31.140]
Like like Debbie does Dallas

[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:31.580]
Right

[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.300]
Let me just say we shot in 35

[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:34.600]
35 millimeter

[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.620]
It took two or three weeks to do

[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:40.320]
Those films were really well done I think

[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.860]
And again I think probably

[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:42.540]
Devil and Miss Jones

[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:43.720]
Neil doesn't like

[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.620]
Because it did have some pretensions

[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:46.960]
But I liked it

[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.800]
Because it's about inside Jennifer Wow

[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:49.380]
Excellent

[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:50.080]
Excellent

[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.800]
I think it's a wonderful film

[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:53.340]
Bourbon Street

[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:56.580]
A guy named Bradley Metzka made wonderful movies

[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.120]
Camille 2000

[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.940]
He was really a superior filmmaker

[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:04.240]
And these are the films from the 70s

[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.080]
That are really good

[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.180]
And throw two, three, four us

[01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:07.880]
Stupid stuff

[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.660]
I think it's like

[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:10.540]
Anyone now can just grab a can

[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.440]
Quarter get a couple girls and make their own

[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.340]
So you know

[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:15.120]
I have it on probably having it on ABC

[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:15.820]
I'm there

[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:16.380]
49

[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:19.740]
Well it was great talking to you

[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:20.340]
Thanks a lot now

[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:20.720]
Thanks

[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.160]
Okay 12 minutes after one at WIdea

[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:23.860]
We'll take a little break

[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:25.800]
And during that break I'll try to bring this man back

[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.760]
To some sense of reality

[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.660]
Your taste is marginal at best
