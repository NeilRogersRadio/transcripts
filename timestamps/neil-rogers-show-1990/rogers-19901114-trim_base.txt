[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]
Oh, you are such a hoser, it's a bad look at a spilling stuff on the table. What's Mitch Ween gonna say when he sees the mess you're making air Mitch Lewis?

[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:08.660]
God!

[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.020]
You're worse than Jerry Lee Lewis. By the way save me one more of those okay,

[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.700]
I'm gonna have a thrill real fit in here because I have never seen such carrying on.

[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.660]
Look at that. This one's almost empty already. You people are a bunch of hosers in here okay?

[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.280]
That's pig to all you goyum. Thank you Andy.

[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.960]
Look at that we got four Jews all in here in the same room boy. I feel so much more comfortable now.

[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.280]
Oh, we need his Robbie Benson.

[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.680]
12 minutes past 11. What is he like 12 now?

[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.620]
Is he ever gonna grow up or what?

[00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.560]
Is he got one of those like pre-pubic diseases where he looks like he's 12 until a day he dies? That's kind of embarrassing isn't it?

[00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.240]
Anyway, you want a great attendant. What is, uh, look at that.

[00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.280]
You've just given a look and you're like oh am I missing something? Well I got news for you honey. There's only two slices left

[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.460]
So don't think about it. Don't scratch your head. There's only two left. What?

[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.280]
What does that mean? Oh she's going over there. You don't have to worry about it. I'll have all the pizza in the world for us over there.

[00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.340]
She's going over to Florida.

[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.240]
I'm gonna become the next case of the people versus...

[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.780]
I object, Mystic Kennedy. Yes, the trial hasn't begun yet.

[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.560]
Oh right. I knew that. Now in the matter of...

[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.100]
Full for a mistrial. Mystic Kennedy, sit down.

[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.420]
Sorry, now Councillor, you have your briefs with you. Uh, your honor, please the court. I am not wearing any underwear.

[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.400]
Please, Mystic Kennedy. Are you prepared to give your opening statement to the jury?

[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.960]
Okay. Well, uh, I'm pretty sure my guy didn't do it. Thank you.

[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.600]
Oh, Mystic, so, Coleman, do you have a question? Yes, now we've reached a verdict, your honor.

[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.480]
But we haven't heard any evidence yet.

[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.420]
Oh, that's okay. We find Mr. Kennedy not intelligent.

[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.620]
But very good looking.

[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.780]
1118 at W.I.O.D.

[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.700]
They're salad. There's pizza. Just everybody, uh, have a great time.

[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.720]
Boy, I've never seen such a psychosis. Was that faster? I'm not talking about you.

[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.260]
Do I have to go through this mood thing with you every day, Cheryl? Just take the goddamn pizza and cut the crap.

[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.260]
Anyway, we hope you're having a nice day.

[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.700]
Every day she comes in here with this mood. If you don't look at her just right, she's like moody and looking at my...

[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.680]
I think her mom oughta slap the crap out of her, okay? It's too late.

[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.800]
If I was your son, I'd run away from home.

[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.140]
Anyway, let's take a call. And how good North Miami be on one? W.I.O.D. you're not North Miami, are you? No.

[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.140]
Of course not. Well, you'd rather be in North Miami, though, wouldn't you? Probably.

[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.280]
Be honest with me. I will. Okay.

[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.620]
Do you ever, um, good, hampathy, Santa Barbara?

[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.660]
Um, maybe a few minutes here and there over the years.

[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.280]
Oh, you know who was in there last week? Kelly Craig.

[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.600]
Kelly Craig from Channel 4 News? Yes, sir.

[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.280]
Are you serial? Yeah, I can play the nurse for a couple of days.

[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.400]
You mean it was like a current like she's doing it now?

[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.660]
Like, it was, it showed, I don't know how long they filmed it, but it showed about...

[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.480]
I was able to week in a half ago.

[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.960]
Incredible. Isn't that funny? We better check that out. You do that.

[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.980]
I love Kelly Craig. I know. I thought I just like.

[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.280]
Oh, I see.

[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.860]
And she's cute as a bug and she can read the news and she's great.

[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.700]
I know. And she's their profession and excellent, although I will say at six o'clock,

[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.860]
I do turn over to Channel 6 and watch it, Giselle and John.

[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.160]
Oh, I like Channel 6. Yeah.

[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.980]
So, well...

[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.920]
The only thing is my set kind of like vibrates when Dave Game comes on.

[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.140]
The whole set starts shaking and tilting and trying to adjust, you know, center the picture. It's impossible.

[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.620]
Oh, you know what he reminds me of?

[00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.920]
Um, you watch that movie, the big one.

[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.980]
The big one? Yeah.

[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.640]
The big one? Yeah. But that John Holmes movie, yeah, I saw that.

[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.960]
Oh, that, that news reporter guy.

[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.980]
I remember when he came on the phone, I'm on the phone.

[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.060]
On the television. I get thinking, oh, first Channel 6.

[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.640]
Channel 6. Channel 7 or Channel 6, sir.

[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.480]
Whatever it is. Oh, he was terrible.

[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.140]
Well, listen, have a wonderful day.

[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.680]
Well, you too. And a great life.

[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.560]
And have a nice afternoon. And thanks for the memory.

[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.620]
All righty, so long. 21 after 11. Now, is this Bill Tanner?

[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.440]
So, we went from a 3-3 or a 3-5 to a 3-...

[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.180]
We have an open line in Palm Beach. Now, that's just pathetic, isn't it?

[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.680]
The Mr. G. I hope somebody goes up there and takes their laundry and wraps it around his neck.

[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.260]
In fact, that's one of the things they did in this movie mortal passion.

[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.620]
After they killed this, uh, the wife's boyfriend, they stuffed him in a big, um, plastic garbage bag.

[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.880]
And they buried him under the backyard under the, uh, thing.

[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.520]
Certainly something to think about, Mr. G.

[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.640]
We have an open line in Broward. Look at that. 524, we're all dead up here.

[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.000]
But spring breaks coming back. Isn't that a laugh?

[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.860]
I keep reading these articles in the Sun Sentinel now every day about that thing.

[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.180]
Well, maybe it wasn't such a good idea to get rid of those kids. Let's bring them back. We really like you, you know?

[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.300]
Yeah, that's what this town always does. They chase everybody out.

[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.800]
They have no alternative, no game plan. All they know is they don't like whoever is here.

[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.020]
How come they don't chase the damn Canadians out? They're French Canadians.

[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.100]
The only thing they bring us here is like, uh, heartburn.

[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.780]
They don't spend a damn dime. They clog up the road.

[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.260]
They run around, but they sound like they're constipated for life.

[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.260]
Get rid of them.

[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.300]
But now they think the kids are going to come flocking back to beautiful Fort Lauderdale

[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.580]
so they can see all those 150-year-old people out there with their rockers and their walkers.

[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.840]
Okay? Get serious.

[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.240]
Here's a mobile on a star line.

[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.240]
Are they both from Spain?

[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.120]
See, we. See, we.

[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.140]
We got 595 in David.

[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.860]
We're going to the media and right here. Hello, boys.

[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.320]
Okay. You know who that was, don't you?

[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.380]
He's starting to get out my nerves again, too. Now that was Woody.

[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.480]
You're getting on my nerves again, Woody. You're okay like once a week, but you're out of control.

[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.760]
What is wrong with these chronics? What is their problem?

[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.020]
They need a mental institution for chronics like Mr. G and Woody.

[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.760]
Mr. G, he wouldn't even, once a year, would be good for him.

[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.340]
But what is the problem with these people that just can't put a lid on it?

[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.320]
Market is up 13 points. Look at that.

[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.380]
I'd go out and start buying like crazy.

[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.000]
W-I-O-D, Georgia's Psychotic.

[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.000]
How you doing?

[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.760]

[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.820]
I'm calling from the airport on the mobile.

[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.320]
It's just got back into town.

[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.380]
Yeah, okay.

[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.960]
Yeah.

[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.800]
Yeah, I want to talk to Neil.

[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.980]
You're speaking to Neil, sir. Get with it.

[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.920]
Take a couple of doggy uppers and get with the program. Come on.

[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.680]
Hey, jet lag. Neil, you came in from New York.

[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.860]
Yeah, that's what we view bank head.

[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.100]
You know, your friend Howard Stern mentioned you yesterday.

[00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.820]
Yeah, I'll bet.

[00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.660]
How he said that?

[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.020]
Howard Stern don't know me from Moishi Pupico.

[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.640]
No, he did mention he said you wanted a better tower.

[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.700]
Yeah, Howard said that.

[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.620]
Sir, come on.

[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.440]
Not how he would never say that. He hates me like, please.

[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.100]
How are you robbing both of them?

[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.840]
Really?

[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:14.520]
Really?

[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.520]
Maybe I can do mid days on K-Rock.

[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.600]
That was on my way to the cemetery yesterday.

[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.060]
You know, we had him tuned in and that was it.

[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.340]
Yeah.

[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.740]
Anyway, how he's liked how he allowed you know, especially is here.

[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.560]
I'd like to just run my fingers through his hair.

[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.020]
It looks like that guy in the, what is it?

[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:29.540]
Twisted his butt.

[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.700]
Twisted his vest there, yeah.

[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.300]
Anyway, wish me happy birthday.

[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.780]
Neil's just got back in the town.

[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.820]
Happy birthday, sir.

[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.480]
Thank you.

[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.060]
I'm going to cheer up a little bit.

[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.100]
I am. How we did say that about you.

[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.080]
Well, that's great.

[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.600]
You must be going through change your life.

[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.680]
Okay. Now you take care, Beth.

[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:45.240]
See you.

[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:45.540]
Bye.

[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:51.080]
Wow. Howard Stern and Dick Summer and Dick Burton,

[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.700]
all the major talent in America.

[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.360]
Loves the Neil Rogers show, okay?

[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.000]
But you know the one that I'm proudest of of all of those people in America,

[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.920]
the one that I'm proudest who loves this show.

[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.540]
Hi, this is Larry King and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers.

[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.160]
My number one fan loves me.

[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.200]
But don't get too close, Larry.

[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.780]
Do you know that they said on CNN yesterday they were doing the story about his latest

[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.280]
break up and his impending divorce.

[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.540]
They said that this is his sixth wife, six.

[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.000]
You know what Angie Dickinson said?

[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.980]
She said if you close your eyes and take a lot of volume, Larry's not so bad.

[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.320]
Especially if it kicks in just at the right time.

[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.700]
It's 11.30.

[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.740]
And now seriously, stop and think about it.

[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.980]
I mean, let's face it, most of us are not the beauty pods, okay?

[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:46.080]
But just imagine waking up next to that to a lump of skin and bones.

[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.160]
With that big thing sticking up under the cover and of course,

[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.400]
as she pulls it up and much towards her grin, it's his nose.

[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.640]
Here's a pay phone and Fort Lauderdale.

[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.260]
Hey Neil.

[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:57.740]
Yeah.

[00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.900]
I got a beauty for you.

[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.820]
I got an excellent tick report from these douche bags down in Miami.

[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.700]
You ready for this one?

[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.400]
Okay.

[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.880]
I go down and get a dollar sticker for tonight for a heat game.

[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.100]
I'm coming down to A Street and I run a red light by mail.

[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:09.900]
Yeah.

[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.440]
This cop pulls me over.

[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.080]
I don't blame him.

[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.160]
He should have thrown your ass in a slimer, put you in Rayford.

[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:14.920]
Well, that should be the right answer.

[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.900]
Right in the chair, pal.

[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.200]
Okay, so listen.

[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:17.620]
Yeah.

[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:18.900]
Stand on behind my car.

[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:19.860]
He's writing them, check it up.

[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:25.620]
And you know just about maybe 10, 15 minutes ago before when you were yelling and screaming about the girl wanting to eat the pizza,

[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.880]
or kitchen, run away from her or all this other crap.

[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:28.580]
He should.

[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:29.380]
Okay.

[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.260]
He says, I want you to turn that radio off right now.

[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.260]
That obscene bastard right there.

[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.140]
I don't want to listen to.

[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.440]
Hey, pal.

[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.400]
I'll go back and stand at your car right there, ticket.

[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.160]
I'm listening to Ray.

[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:39.980]
Wait a minute.

[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.820]
He called me an obscene bastard.

[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.640]
A bastard.

[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.740]
A bastard, man.

[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.820]
You believe the bastard he said?

[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:46.700]
How old was he?

[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.180]
110.

[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.560]
I'm a Cuban guy about maybe 30 years old.

[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.200]
Oh, yeah.

[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.600]
Well, I got your bastard right over here, pal.

[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.960]
Okay, it's right under your badge.

[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.780]
He says, I don't want to be up to be up.

[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.360]
What happened to me?

[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.360]
He'd think exactly how he said.

[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.120]
This guy is obscene.

[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.420]
He's a bastard and I don't want to have my time.

[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.320]
Waste to listen to him.

[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.080]
I said, look, you're giving me a chance.

[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.000]
Waste to listen to his own radio.

[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.560]
Time to turn on radio memories.

[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.080]
It's right up.

[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.780]
I'm going to turn on La Cuban Isma.

[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:10.800]
That's right up his alley.

[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.320]
Well, I turned it up just a little bit louder.

[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.040]
He kind of threatened me.

[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.320]
You know, are you trying to threaten me here?

[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.240]
He says, are you trying to challenge me?

[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.060]
I said, I'm not trying to challenge you at all.

[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:21.680]
I said, you're right.

[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.240]
I'm listening to my car.

[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:23.580]
Exactly.

[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.880]
You want to listen to the damn show?

[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.840]
You know I'm here, his crap?

[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.560]
I still got a $30 ticket.

[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:28.260]
Good for him.

[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.340]
I can't even read his name.

[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.540]
I wish I could because I'd let you play.

[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.880]
He probably knows Joe Carrillo.

[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.080]
So you better watch it, pal.

[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.520]
I'm looking at God out of there.

[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.520]
Anyways, I thought you'd just like to have a little information about those lovely pigs

[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.140]
down in South Dade.

[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.240]
Those Metro bastards.

[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.440]
Let me just tell you, I want to tell you a little story, okay?

[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:51.100]
You know, we do a spot for Low Jack, which I've been doing Low Jack for years now since they first came into Florida.

[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.120]
And I really believe in it.

[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.840]
It's a great, great invention.

[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:54.880]
And it works.

[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.560]
And it's just a tremendous, okay?

[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.960]
And we do a good job for them on a show.

[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.160]
And I joke around with this thing with the pig reports and the pig patrol in a spot.

[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.340]
I'll say, you know, it helps the pigs get your car back.

[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.140]
And some Jack asks from one of the sheriffs to probably the BSL.

[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.020]
But I don't know where, call them up there whining about it the other day, okay?

[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.480]
Because I use the word pig.

[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.060]
Now, let me ask, asks you a question.

[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.760]
You know, that charity football game that they play every year, what do they call it?

[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.560]
It's called Z-Pig-A-Ball.

[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.840]
And who came up with that name?

[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.360]
Did I come up with it or did they do it themselves, okay?

[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:24.820]
Right, you know what I mean?

[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.080]
Yeah. So if they say pig bullets, okay.

[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.520]
But if I say the pigs, then right away, and I'm seeing bass, do whatever he said, okay?

[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.500]
I hope his guacamole melts on his thing, okay?

[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.120]
I hope he gets four flats and has to walk back in a station.

[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:37.400]
Yeah.

[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.440]
Radio breaks out that and outstanding.

[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.040]
And his foot's in his ears, drag all the way and burn on the spot.

[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.200]
And runs into Dave Gamer in the middle of the highway.

[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.360]
I don't know where you were born.

[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.760]
I thought you'd get a charge out of it.

[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.620]
I don't know where you were born.

[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:47.980]
See?

[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.180]
Where's the remote today?

[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.960]
We're not doing a remote.

[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.760]
I know it's not a remote, but where is the pig?

[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.360]
Flora's, it's on 79th Street, just two blocks east of Biscayne.

[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:56.980]
Can you handle that?

[00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:57.820]
I think I can.

[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.560]
You do a great job and I enjoy listening to you.

[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.480]
In fact, I turned on a police dispatcher's.

[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.720]
I work over at Fort Lauderdale and they all see you over there.

[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.420]
And anyways, I thought you didn't enjoy it, so have a good one.

[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.260]
Okay, tell him to put a lid on it.

[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:09.860]
Thank you, right?

[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:10.340]
See you.

[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.180]
I've seen bastard indeed, okay?

[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.320]
Boy, we still have...

[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.380]
See, I can understand that from 75 and 80-year-old Cubans

[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.320]
who are still screaming about Marie-O.

[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.660]
If you had any idea, if I had $10 for every Cuban who listens to this show,

[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:32.700]
I could buy Cuba and send Fidel back to where the hell he came from.

[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.560]
Where'd he come from?

[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:33.980]
Hunger?

[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.580]
So I've been here.

[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:37.740]
Thank you.

[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.440]
What's real bad for you?

[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.880]
But tastes real good.

[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:41.680]
Sugar!

[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.480]
And what gives you the excess energy to drive mom crazy?

[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.040]
Sugar!

[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.420]
So what breakfast cereal will you tell mom to buy?

[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.480]
Next time she goes shopping.

[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.800]
Sugar, sugar!

[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.200]
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar!

[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:02.540]
New super sugar-coated sugar-shockers are little bits of raw cane,

[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.540]
drenched in honey, and coated with powdered sugar,

[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.980]
glucose, fructose, corn syrup, and other natural sweeteners.

[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.520]
And tastes just like sugar-coated sugar!

[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.340]
Right, because there's no yucky vitamins,

[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.600]
minerals to spoil your fun.

[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.080]
Yeah!

[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.440]
And how does it make you feel?

[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.400]
Like I'm vibrating.

[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.040]
Mommy loves such cartoons!

[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.540]
Mommy loves to play sports!

[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.740]
Mommy loves to be fun!

[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.220]
And mom loves to love sugar-shockers too,

[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.100]
because inside every box,

[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.960]
there's a free bottle of new Flintstones-truel-bellium.

[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.440]
So try new super sugar-coated sugar-shockers

[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.400]
from your friends at irresponsible food.

[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.280]
I have no idea.

[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.020]
11.40.

[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.780]
20 till noon at WIOD,

[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.480]
there's an open line in Broward, 524.

[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.420]
Now, listen, in 20 minutes,

[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.240]
Dick and Doug will be over at Flora's,

[00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.760]
which is right up the street, 79th Street.

[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.000]
Why do people keep asking?

[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.960]
I've explained it over and over.

[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.540]
This is not a hard place to find.

[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:05.400]
Okay?

[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.840]
If you're coming from like on the beach,

[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.820]
you come on a 79th Street Causeway,

[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.500]
you come West,

[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.880]
and then the road kind of like there's a fork.

[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.300]
When you get on the other side of the bridge,

[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.800]
there's a fork in the road.

[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.680]
Pick it up and the stuff in your nose.

[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.340]
Now, there's a fork in that road.

[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.240]
So don't go to the right,

[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.220]
because that goes off the 82nd Street,

[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.140]
which is a nice way to go home from here to get to I-95

[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.680]
because 79th Street,

[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.180]
when you get west of Biscayne,

[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.000]
is the worst street in all of South Florida.

[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.600]
All of people on 79th Street are on drugs.

[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.080]
Okay?

[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:34.700]
Or on something,

[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.560]
because they drive like their finger is somewhere.

[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:38.640]
The worst.

[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.320]
Airvee, Jolopy,

[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.260]
Airvee, Maniac,

[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.300]
Airvee, Duschbeck.

[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.820]
Anyway, 79th Street.

[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.360]
It's on the right-hand side as you're going west.

[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.780]
It's on the left-hand side as you're going east.

[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.840]
It's on the north side of 79th Street.

[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.780]
A couple of blocks east of Biscayne Boulevard.

[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:56.640]
Flores.

[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.200]
It's green with the red sign.

[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:58.920]
It's outdoors.

[00:14:59.200 --> 00:14:59.780]
There's benches.

[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.900]
There's parking spaces.

[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.480]
That's Flores.

[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:03.120]
Got it.

[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.160]
It's like the other day.

[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.920]
We're like two blocks south of Gulfstream Park

[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.260]
at the Spexlast Wednesday.

[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.060]
And you still had people.

[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.260]
Oh, they're getting lost.

[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.940]
They don't know how hard it is.

[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.860]
When you say I'm at Biscayne and 208th or whatever it was.

[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.400]
How hard is it?

[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.000]
And that's one thing we'll be checking on this afternoon.

[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.760]
So anyway, they'll be over there from noon to two.

[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.580]
And we've got the unbelievable t-shirts,

[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.340]
the incredible ones that are just from Captured Glory.

[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.580]
We'll make all our t-shirts.

[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.400]
And the Rick and SUDs,

[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.840]
snooze cruise t-shirts,

[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.860]
one of which I'm modeling myself right now.

[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.540]
And those are 20 bucks a piece.

[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.600]
We'll have them in sizes, no less.

[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.660]
I mean, we really have this thing under control.

[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.260]
And the best in the Yolk cassette tapes, which are 20 bucks.

[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.980]
Now, Joe at Flores,

[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.420]
well boy, that lunch was great.

[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.840]
If you buy two slices of pizza,

[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:56.760]
so does our free.

[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.020]
If you buy some of our stuff.

[00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:58.600]
If you donate.

[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.640]
And at the end of the noon to four segment,

[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.720]
he's going to donate 20% of all the money he takes in during those four hours.

[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.480]
Two Kamala Sows.

[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.520]
And when I get over there shortly after two,

[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.500]
we will, everybody be sure when you buy any of this stuff and make your donation.

[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.980]
Are we going to take care of that, by the way,

[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.440]
if they got the entry box, great.

[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:17.960]
Boy, are we doing it today?

[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:18.780]
It's incredible.

[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:20.860]
Just wait till we get there.

[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:21.540]
We'll screw it up good.

[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.680]
But anyway, fill out one of the entry.

[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.360]
Then don't try to stuff the ballot box because then it's going to work.

[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.300]
One per customer only, okay?

[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.780]
And then between two and three, I'll draw.

[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.760]
And we'll do it.

[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.320]
We got those three pair of tickets on the 50 yard line,

[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.840]
section 420, 442, like I said.

[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.200]
And it's great, right on the 50 yard line.

[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.480]
Little up high, you look down with that panoramic view.

[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.380]
It'll be great.

[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.960]
You'll feel like you're in our sky box, but thank God you won't be.

[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.440]
It's 1143 at WIOD, four-larterdale.

[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:52.200]
Yes, Neil.

[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:52.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:53.280]
How you doing?

[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:53.740]
Great.

[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.600]
I'd like to talk to you about two subjects, sir, not even related to each other.

[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.680]
How's Bill Kolder doing?

[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.420]
He's coming along.

[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.000]
Is it?

[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:01.940]
Slow, but deal.

[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:02.540]
He'll be okay.

[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.160]
You think he's ever going to get back on here?

[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.400]
I sure hope so.

[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.260]
Okay.

[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.860]
The other question is, it's totally unrelated.

[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.040]
Who do you think is the best baseball player that ever lived?

[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.960]
I know it's a tough question, but I heard you talk about Ricky Henderson.

[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.320]
The best baseball player who ever lived?

[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:18.600]
I know.

[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.720]
This is like during football.

[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.060]
I'd say Felix Mantia.

[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:21.940]
No.

[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.700]
Do you think Mickey Mantle could have been if he never heard himself?

[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:28.120]
Wow.

[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.160]
I know it.

[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.680]
See, this kind of a question.

[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.180]
I know.

[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.060]
See, I was a big Mickey Mantle fan because as a kid I was a Yankee fan.

[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:40.820]
And, you know, he won a triple crown after you were hit 365 and 54 home runs.

[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.140]
And, whatever one.

[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.060]
And, he was great.

[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.020]
He was a tremendous speed.

[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.000]
He didn't run the bases luck because he had bad knees.

[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.400]
And, those teams used to score 10-12 runs a game so they weren't a running team anyway.

[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.260]
He didn't have to run.

[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.040]
And, the great fielder, great arm, tremendous power, switch hitter.

[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.200]
I mean, he had everything going.

[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.820]
And, he was certainly one of the top five.

[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.180]
Top five?

[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.140]
Then, there were those who say Willie Mays.

[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.920]
But, to try to compare athletes from one era to the next is not possible.

[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.860]
You can't compare Ty Cobb to Brooks Robinson.

[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:22.140]
You can't compare Babe Ruth to Henry Aaron or Willie Mays or Mickey Mantle or Luke Gerrig to many of these two Willie Stargil.

[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:22.880]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.660]
Well, Neil, I think you're the best broadcaster.

[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.320]
You can't compare Dick Rote to, say, Sean Dunston.

[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.500]
Dr. Strange Globden.

[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:29.720]
Right.

[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.220]
Neil, you're the best broadcaster that has ever been on the air.

[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.500]
No question about it.

[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.700]
That's what they're all saying now.

[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.620]
If people in South Florida ever believe that we'd really have a show.

[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.060]
People in South Florida don't know anything.

[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:41.540]
They don't know.

[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.860]
They're asked from their elbow.

[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.700]
And, including that pig cop out there was making all kinds of grotesque comments about the show.

[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.420]
I hope he sticks his burrito where the moon don't shine, okay?

[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.900]
Exactly. Go Corning. Go Corning.

[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:52.380]
Okay.

[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.040]
All right, Neil.

[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:53.540]
See you.

[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.440]
There's a guy from the Glassworks.

[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.020]
Markets up almost 12 points.

[00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:58.920]
What the hell do you want?

[00:18:59.080 --> 00:18:59.700]
Nothing's perfect.

[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.220]
And so, anyway, Dick and Dunston will be over there from noon to noon.

[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.120]
And, we do have the cellular phone over there.

[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:04.840]
Marvin is there.

[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:05.880]
Ilyana is there.

[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.500]
Who want to make a date?

[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.580]
She's been trying to pedal me that cube.

[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.360]
She's a very nice young lady, by the way.

[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.060]
She really isn't spite of all the people here trying to hit up on her.

[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.700]
But, she's a really nice person.

[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.060]
But, she's been trying to pedal me that Cuban coffee.

[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.260]
I'm sorry, okay?

[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.980]
I can, I have an iron stomach, but that stuff is like,

[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:26.160]
it's like taking acid from your battery and just swinging it down.

[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.100]
And, you've got to be nuts.

[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.940]
And, you wonder why some of those people get so emotional and temperamental.

[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.600]
And, if you were drinking that stuff, you'd be like doing a Mexican hat dance all day long.

[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.480]
You'd be like on sugar shockers 24 hours a day.

[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.120]
George likes it.

[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.320]
Because he grew up in Ovanna.

[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.580]
Little Ovanna.

[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.720]
1146 in W.I.D., I don't know where you grew up.

[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.720]
It doesn't make any difference.

[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.780]
Maybe he wants to rot a bus through Ilya.

[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:50.520]
Who the hell cares?

[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.820]
See, people don't listen.

[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.320]
They hear stereotypes.

[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.600]
People say, out in the Aradio show, a shock radio.

[00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:57.340]
It's boring.

[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:57.920]
It's vulgar.

[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:58.520]
It's disgusting.

[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.100]
He's in, what was the word, accrued something bastard.

[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.800]
The bastard part's right, but the other part offends me bitterly.

[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.440]
But then when you listen, not once, but for a few days.

[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:13.880]
Because once it's like a soap opera, you can't come in in the middle and expect to know what's going on.

[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.980]
You listen for a few days and all of a sudden you say, hey, I'm having a few laughs and not such a bad time.

[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.720]
It isn't really so bad.

[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:20.600]
Right?

[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.480]
It only hurts when they stop.

[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.400]
And now, language lab.

[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.260]
The show that teaches you a foreign language in less than 60 seconds.

[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.020]
Today's lesson, Greek.

[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:31.780]
Listen one.

[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.440]
Strawberry pie.

[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.440]
Strawberry pie.

[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.280]
Lesson two.

[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:38.540]
Apple pie.

[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.220]
Apple pie.

[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.100]
Lesson three.

[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:43.700]
Pumpkin pie.

[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:44.820]
Bunky pie.

[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.440]
Customer.

[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.120]
What kind of pie do you have?

[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:50.320]
Answer.

[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.980]
Apple pie, strawberry and funky.

[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.840]
Language lab is a public service.

[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.580]
I mean, not be copied or authorized for resale.

[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.980]
Okay, now let me ask you something.

[00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:04.300]
If you gave the Nelson twins a big haircut and you took all that here and you put it inside in one of those crusts and you put it in the oven, what kind of a pie would that be?

[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.040]
1154 at WIOD.

[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.000]
We have an open line and brown.

[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.860]
Well, think about it for two seconds.

[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.440]
524 at WIOD.

[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.520]
Okay, we're trying to pick up the FTO.

[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.720]
We're having a little bit of difficulty.

[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.740]
Let's go to plantation.

[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:22.320]
Hello.

[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.540]
Hi, first time caller in plantation.

[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:25.180]
Great.

[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.920]
Why don't you say hello and tell you that I think your show is great.

[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.280]
It's incredible, isn't it?

[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:29.880]
Yes it is.

[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.400]
More fun than a barrel of monkey do.

[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.400]
And I wanted to ask you a huge favor.

[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.600]
Okay, whatever you want.

[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.980]
Because you're so nice or at least you're pretending to be anyway.

[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.800]
Well, could you please play your KCK's show in your America's front of your accident?

[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:42.480]
Both.

[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.320]
Well, whichever you choose.

[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.480]
Well, which KC are you talking about?

[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.300]
You don't mean that one with the George Michael and a monkey on his back again, do you?

[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.580]
Well, I love that one, but you can play the other one too.

[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.680]
I'd rather play KCK's because it's great and it kills a lot of time.

[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:55.740]
Okay, also.

[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.960]
Have you ever tried picking up FTO all by the way?

[00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.760]
No, I haven't.

[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.140]
We're working on it.

[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:05.700]
Okay, now what was the other thing?

[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:09.160]
I'd like to call Kurt Apanovic in plantation a major douchebag.

[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:09.580]
Okay.

[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.620]
And I'd like to say thank you to my boss Barbara Sugarman for letting me see on the line.

[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.180]
Barbara Sugarman.

[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:15.440]
Yes.

[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:16.780]
Oh, hey, hey.

[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.320]
Have a great day.

[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.520]
Thank you very much.

[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:20.020]
See you.

[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:20.240]
Bye.

[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:20.840]
Wow.

[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.120]
Wow.

[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.860]
Two open lines and broward.

[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.480]
I'll see they know I'm going to play that.

[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.580]
That's why somebody dropped off.

[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:28.480]
Well, I got news for you.

[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.860]
If you've got something important to do in this town, God bless you.

[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:31.320]
I'm KCKism.

[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.720]
Come on to your life.

[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.640]
I'm Hollywood with another edition of America's Bottom 40.

[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.040]
Born to you by the ANSI-5 Company's newest acne medication.

[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.320]
ANSI-MOAN-5 for simple free teenagers.

[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.280]
And so it goes.

[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.200]
I have to be a little quicker on a tape, boy.

[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.500]
It's a good show.

[00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.280]
We've got the worst songs in America and we're counting them down.

[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.140]
Record stories are showing them.

[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.980]
For some unknown reason you're buying them and I'm using them as coasters.

[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:11.660]
First, let's review the top three songs on the charts.

[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.280]
And number three, Guns and Roses is singing Sweet Child of Mine.

[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:20.540]
Well, if I had a child around the house today, I'd have these four words for lead guitarist

[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.860]
slash and his chords.

[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.500]
Stay the hell away.

[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.560]
And number two, you and Roses.

[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.260]
They're eating a living in a perfect world.

[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.940]
And especially not for you, Hughie, since you don't speak proper English.

[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.540]
And a number one George Michael sings, he's got a monkey on his back.

[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.660]
Well, I would imagine it's getting a little crowded back here, George.

[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.440]
But then again you probably don't mind.

[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:58.500]
And by the way George, there are these remarkable shaving instruments called Razer.

[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.600]
I won and lose that silly ass theory.

[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.800]
Other songs on the charts, the band Johnny H. Jazz with I want to be a hero

[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.960]
is moving down on the charts and deservedly so.

[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.740]
Apparently Johnny also ate music.

[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.220]
I don't think Carol Stadis is eminent Johnny, so get a real job.

[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.960]
And there is a song I like, Rod Stewart's newest release, Forever Young.

[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.740]
And for a moment I thought it was a song about me, Forever Hung.

[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.600]
I can't now it's time for a long distance dedication.

[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.660]
It comes first from a listener in Pasadena, California, right to dear Casey.

[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:45.400]
I'm 16 years old, president of my class, I'm six foot two, I've blonde here.

[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.640]
I weigh 175 pounds and started quarter back for my high school team.

[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.400]
But Casey, I have a problem.

[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.200]
The girls simply will not leave me alone.

[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:58.800]
It seems as though I've already won before, is my good looks, my excellent physique.

[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.000]
Why can't they just like me as a friend?

[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.640]
Treat me as a person instead of some sex object.

[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.120]
And quit hitting upon me all the time.

[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.460]
Casey, do you have any suggestions, sign Todd?

[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.920]
Well, here's my answer, dear flaming horrible.

[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.820]
Okay, let's look at you at W.O.D.

[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:23.180]
Kelly Craig is going to be singing the National Anthem prior to the heat game at the arena tonight.

[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.020]
Kelly Craig is also on set at Barber.

[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.480]
She's also on the news on Channel 4. She is everywhere.

[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.780]
For a little squirt, she still gets around.

[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.780]
And you know what we say here at W.O.D., there's nothing like a little squirt.

[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.640]
Oh, it's news time already?

[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.520]
Okay, we have one open line indeed.

[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:38.480]
751.

[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.960]
And we expect you to fill it too with anything you like.

[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.780]
751, W.O.D., and then Palm Beach, 655 W.O.D.

[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.520]
When we come back after the news, Rick and Duttle be over there at Flores.

[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.540]
We'll get a little update on the phone.

[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.220]
You know, retirement just wasn't my style.

[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:56.960]
So I began working nights down here as your janitor in the solar office building.

[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.860]
Just to keep busy, I guess, because of the Facebook, and when we wait.

[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.360]
Anyway, there's the big cheese now.

[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:05.900]
Rick, how you doing tonight?

[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.000]
Hey, we're getting late, right?

[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.820]
How you doing? You having a pretty tough night?

[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.780]
Yeah. Good night.

[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:11.380]
Good night.

[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.820]
You're going to watch a game tonight?

[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.380]
Yeah, I'm in the Cross of Street, free pizza at Beer Night over there.

[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.340]
I'm having a pretty tough day.

[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.520]
I thought I'd just watch the game with the fellows over at the bar.

[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.780]
Oh, yeah. Well, I'm just going to listen to it on this old radio here.

[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.320]
And tennis kind of shaking.

[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.440]
When they get a big screen color TV over there, it's best picture ever seen.

[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:27.860]

[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:29.240]
Yeah, a big screen color. Great picture.

[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.300]
I heard it is.

[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.460]
The ride sure liked to be there.

[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.680]
When you know I got all my work done.

[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.420]
Oh, really? You're all done?

[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:35.920]
Yeah, you're supposed to. Maybe I could.

[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:36.840]
Well, I'll tell you what.

[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.300]
Maybe I could.

[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.640]
I got my BMW in the garage.

[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.800]
I got a Blah-Poodnik radio, and then I can pick up the...

[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.320]
You can drive me?

[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.240]
Anything. No, no.

[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:44.960]
I'll give my car keys.

[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:45.980]
Why don't you clean out my car?

[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.440]
I got a wicked stand in the back seat.

[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.100]
Yeah, I've got some stuff in the trunk included up with Simonis.

[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.000]
I'll be back in about two hours, and maybe I'll bring a piece of pizza.

[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:53.640]
Okay, Dad?

[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:55.800]
Well, dad, listen, thanks a lot.

[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.120]
I hear my keys, and be careful not to scratch the car.

[00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.320]
And I'll be back in about two hours.

[00:26:59.320 --> 00:26:59.800]
Two hours.

[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:00.900]
Yeah, I got one.

[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:01.520]
I've got a watch.

[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.660]
You're not going to bring...

[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:03.420]
Well, you're...

[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:04.000]
You're...

[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.600]
Esther said you were a worthless...

[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.580]
...second Simonis.

[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.400]
Hell, you can't be my son.

[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.660]
Nobody's that ungrateful.

[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:10.680]
You...

[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:11.680]
...wrap...

[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.500]
...and I'll take your...

[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.340]
...and stay BMW and run that mother...

[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.240]
...right into the damn year where you left your work.

[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.780]
Nothing gets someone's attention.

[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.740]
Second good spring of world famous.

[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:23.680]
Pig face.

[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.440]
This message brought to you by the National Curse Foundation.

[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.220]
And remember our motto.

[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.800]
Go f*** yourself.

[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.500]
Oh!

[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.140]
So, that's a feelin'

[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.800]
You'll do life with me by hand.

[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.860]
So, that's a feelin'

[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.860]
You'll do life with me by hand.

[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.520]
Feelin' right into the radio.

[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.960]
Feelin' right into the radio.

[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.860]
Feelin' right into the radio.

[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.480]
So, that's your life that you've had.

[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.740]
Still can't get it in.

[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.460]
Okay, we're trying to pick up the Mic Robert Show.

[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.480]
12-08 at W-W-I-O-D.

[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:36.560]
Look at that board boy.

[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.900]
Three hot calls on that board right now.

[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:39.920]
Did I predict it or not?

[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.540]
Do I know this crowd like a book?

[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.020]
Like a map?

[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.340]
Now, when are they gonna call in from over at Flores to give us a little lay of land?

[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:49.980]
Is that...

[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.780]
We don't want to put a lot of pressure on Rick and Doug,

[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.280]
but it would be nice to give little...

[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.440]
...for play before things get started.

[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.160]
Find out if there's some people over there.

[00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:58.940]
If there's sellin' no shirts.

[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.980]
Are we gonna do pictures in bumper stickers too today?

[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.680]
Does anybody know?

[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.040]
Now, but he's got any.

[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.740]
We don't know what we're doing, but we're having a great time.

[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.880]
We're raising a lot of money and killing some time.

[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.180]
Pembroke Pines.

[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:14.680]
Hey, Neil.

[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.340]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.800]
I got some updated information for you.

[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:18.560]
Okay.

[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.700]
About three weeks old, though.

[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.020]
Uh, Blue's minor delicatestin, still there.

[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.300]
Yeah, it's still there?

[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.180]
Yeah. Great.

[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.080]
They got two of them.

[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:28.860]
They have two?

[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:29.320]
Yeah.

[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:30.280]
Where's the other one?

[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.960]
It's not too far from the one you're talking about on near Wyoming,

[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:35.760]
and then Nickel.

[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:36.300]
Right.

[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.560]
On seven mile?

[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.360]
That's not Mickey McNichol, is it?

[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:39.700]
No.

[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:40.600]
And that's six mile.

[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.080]
No, he's at Hazel Park.

[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:42.560]
Right.

[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.700]
Keep him there.

[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.340]
Stick him in the infield and don't give him a map.

[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.780]
What happened to him? He used to be a good runner.

[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.620]
Yeah, well, I don't want to go into it.

[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:50.340]
All right.

[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.540]
Mickey, you make me sick.

[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:52.560]
Yeah.

[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.300]
Make me lose my money.

[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.220]
And a joke, pavya, man, up in the air everywhere.

[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.400]
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.580]
Hey, I know how we can make money.

[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:01.880]
Let's open up a school.

[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:07.520]
He's got more X's on the program than the used to have in the combat zone in Boston.

[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.380]
Okay, that's how many X's he's got on that program on every horse.

[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.760]
Whoop, he's in the air again.

[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.720]
Then I rent him out of Eastern Airlines.

[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.280]
Maybe it could debil themselves out.

[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:17.820]
There you go.

[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.600]
He can get you in the air for just a couple of bucks.

[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.600]
Let's open up a school on how to be a Canadian.

[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:24.740]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.280]
All right.

[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.580]
Ten past noon at WIOD.

[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.100]
You know what happened?

[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.140]
They were all lit up again there momentarily and three of them disappeared again.

[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:32.600]
Well, you people are like,

[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.000]
St. Vitus dance today.

[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.000]
Okay, you must talk about having something exciting in your pants.

[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.740]
They must have like those red fire ants all over their underwear today.

[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:41.160]
You're nuts.

[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.560]
An open line in date, one in brown,

[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.080]
and one on our star line at star IOD and the bat line isn't ringing yet.

[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:47.820]
Are they over there?

[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.080]
Suts, you know, suds isn't going to be there yet.

[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.980]
That day late in the dollar shirt routine of his is getting pretty old.

[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.760]
He's a great guy, but you know something you can't live off that forever.

[00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.300]
Right?

[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.160]
Is he over there?

[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.780]
We don't know.

[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:03.660]
We haven't heard a thing.

[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.380]
Well, that's because Marvin's over there supervising.

[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.540]
He's probably playing the grab this and grab that with Ilyana.

[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:09.500]
We know what that's all about.

[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:15.760]
This clear all production presents possibly the most important concert of our time.

[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.320]
She made aid.

[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.440]
The benefit concert to get she made Okunnersome hair.

[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:21.900]
She made aid.

[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:22.480]
Featuring.

[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.600]
John Bon Jovi.

[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:24.220]
Shear.

[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.160]
Millie Vanilley.

[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.020]
Marge Simpson.

[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.620]
Anybody on MTV and many, many more with hair to spare.

[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.280]
Check your blow dryers at the door for she made aid.

[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.440]
The concert that's head and shoulders above the rest.

[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.500]
Take it's available at Fine Arts Alliance everywhere.

[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.460]
1215 at WID.

[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.800]
Now, are they not going to call in and say that it's new things we're going a little too well.

[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.060]
And how are we going to know?

[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.500]
How are we going to be able to communicate with the audience?

[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.380]
See? Well, I'm not going to go into it.

[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.680]
For some, as our reason, all three lines and they've opened up again.

[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.140]
There they are.

[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.480]
Finally, 751-9463-751-WID and two in Broward.

[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.760]
Very strange day on a phone.

[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:06.240]
1207-Evereline on the board was lit and all of a sudden they disappeared like the phone had saved by his dance.

[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.180]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:07.920]
Hello!

[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:11.140]
What the heck happened?

[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.240]
Calm down a little bit.

[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.900]
Oh, I thought everything went away.

[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.460]
No, we're still here.

[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.300]
Okay, are we on?

[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.080]
What do you mean are we on?

[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.720]
I thought that's not where anything I can hear.

[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.140]
Oh my God, we are on.

[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.080]
Wait a minute. Don't they have a radio over there?

[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:23.660]
Well, yeah.

[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.500]
But I'm not near it.

[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:25.920]
Yeah?

[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.320]
Well, this is your good friend, sir.

[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.740]
Yeah, we know who it is.

[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.960]
Don't start sucking around with this.

[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:32.240]
Where is?

[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.300]
You're already there?

[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:33.760]
We're off?

[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.880]
Yeah. I've been here for a half an hour.

[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:36.900]
Yeah, all right.

[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.520]
You're probably calling for the car.

[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.540]
He's calling from the car.

[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:42.280]
He's on I-75 on his way to Naples.

[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.020]
He's only got American.

[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.840]
He comes to work by way of Naples, Italy.

[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.660]
We've got all the shirts laid out here.

[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.420]
Man, there are just tons of them.

[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.700]
Yeah, the snooze cruise shirts, your shirts,

[00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.880]
and all the sizes, the pictures are all here.

[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.060]
And we're set to start writing and sell it.

[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.600]
Yeah, but there are no people there yet?

[00:32:59.000 --> 00:32:59.220]
Yeah.

[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:00.460]
Eight.

[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:02.420]
What do you mean eight?

[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.520]
Well, there's eight just a few people.

[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.800]
Well, there's just a few right now.

[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.540]
Well, what the hell is that all about?

[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.420]
I don't know.

[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:11.140]
Geez.

[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.160]
What about you all this big, ya?

[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.280]
I'm sure they're on their way.

[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.860]
They better be.

[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000]
Hold on, just a minute.

[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:18.260]
Hold on. This will be great.

[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.560]
There's no more room in the parking lot.

[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:23.340]
Yeah, all right.

[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.180]
I'm serious.

[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.020]
And we got eight people there?

[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.800]
Well, I don't think they know what's going on here.

[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.620]
We're in the floor, a little dining room here,

[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.180]
in the screen room, and everybody is like milling around.

[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.680]
They're not really sure what to do yet.

[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.220]
It's basically since it involves money.

[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.860]
They got to think about it and get counseling.

[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.000]
What are you talking about?

[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:46.500]
Well, I'm just...

[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:50.140]
The parking lot is full, but we ain't selling anything.

[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.520]
You mean like the parking lot is full of their customers

[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.280]
who are there to have baked ziti and spaghetti and pizza?

[00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:58.740]
Well, I don't know.

[00:33:58.740 --> 00:33:59.660]
Get the hell out of there.

[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.040]
We got business to do here.

[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:01.820]
I know, exactly.

[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:02.920]
And I don't know.

[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.060]
I'm trying to take an inventory.

[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.100]
Oh, no.

[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.560]
You don't mean to tell me this is going to be a big bomb, do you?

[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.480]
I'm telling you, man, the parking lot has passed.

[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.380]
It's already passed, but we're not selling anything.

[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:17.920]
Now, T-shirt, Bob and Tom are here.

[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:19.600]
Which guys like to buy a shirt?

[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:21.340]
Need a little...

[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.460]
Neil is speechless.

[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.640]
What, Kurt?

[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:25.680]
Oh, jeez.

[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.860]
Here I am asking you to evil twin something.

[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.840]
The parking lot is full, right?

[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.820]
What do you mean next door?

[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.720]
Well, they can park next door.

[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.940]
But why aren't we selling any shirts or anything?

[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.340]
Why is everybody out there?

[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.240]
I'll take you.

[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.100]
You want to know why?

[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:41.380]
Yeah.

[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.680]
Because they're all there for the dolphin tickets.

[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:45.940]
Well...

[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.660]
First of all, the dolphin tickets are going to happen

[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.160]
to be between two and three.

[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:49.860]
That's number one.

[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.100]
And number two, unless they buy something,

[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.020]
they can't fill out one of the little entry slips

[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.540]
and they can't eligible to win them anyway.

[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.760]
I was going to tell you that for that is kind of a needless trip.

[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.720]
Do you mean to say that this is going to be just a bomb today?

[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:01.360]
Well, not yet.

[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.560]
It's just getting started.

[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.040]
I'm just telling you these are a thing of a plan.

[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:04.700]
What do you mean it's getting started?

[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.360]
If the parking lot is full, you've got a bunch of drifters around there.

[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.880]
Probably the same half dozen misfits that come there every remote

[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.940]
and stand around with their finger up their nose.

[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:12.840]
Well, there you go.

[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.320]
Oh, jeez.

[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.680]
You can park next door, okay, in the sun plaza.

[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.540]
Oh, right underneath the waxy sign.

[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.100]
Just tip your hat.

[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:20.720]
Yeah.

[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:21.740]
There is.

[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.440]
Just like your finger up the picture of Budell on that poster.

[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.440]
There is no picture.

[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:26.880]
Well, there won't be one I get done with it.

[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.580]
So that's it.

[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:29.360]
So it's a bomb?

[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.100]
We're here.

[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.660]
And people are like milling around my car.

[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.300]
Well, what do you mean they're milling around?

[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.360]
They're milling.

[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:37.960]
Oh, here we go.

[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.260]
We're starting to sell, okay.

[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.720]
Get the money out of your pockets and your hands too, okay?

[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.060]
And put things at change and start buying stuff.

[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:45.320]

[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.700]
What are they waiting for?

[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.000]
Are they shopping for shirts?

[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:48.560]
I don't know.

[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.580]
I'm going to have to get out here with a bullhorn to start directing.

[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.220]
Yeah, bull is the operative word pal.

[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:52.740]
Okay.

[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.040]
Well, we're here.

[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:54.700]
We're ready.

[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.620]
By the way, I'm still trying this second.

[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.380]
Hold on a second.

[00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:57.720]
Okay.

[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.620]
I'm trying to pick up the mic Robert show.

[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.360]
Here's my mic.

[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.280]
Wow, it's coming in unusually well today.

[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:05.740]
Wait.

[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.500]
I heard him say, yeah.

[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:09.920]
You're getting better than I can.

[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:10.940]
I must be having problems.

[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:11.260]
Wow.

[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.920]
Okay. Well, listen, give us another report in about 20 minutes

[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.400]
and I'm going to just land, lace into these people.

[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:16.780]
You better.

[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.460]
They are slow.

[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.000]
You better.

[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:18.900]
They are slow.

[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:20.040]
This tone has been pumped.

[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.340]
By the way, Jim Jensen was excellent yesterday.

[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.240]
Why, thank you.

[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:23.740]
He was good.

[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:24.860]
I didn't say you were good.

[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:25.660]
I said he was good.

[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.280]
I'll tell him.

[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.820]
Call him back and tell him when he wakes up.

[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.200]
He don't even know who I am.

[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.420]
You know these dolphins, they pretend they don't listen to the show.

[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.280]
Every one of those dolphins listens to this show.

[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:33.960]
Becky doesn't.

[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:34.720]
You bet he does.

[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:35.340]
Does he really?

[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:36.160]
Do you remember everything you said?

[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.380]
Sure, he listens all the time.

[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:38.140]
He loves the show.

[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.160]
He said douchebag.

[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:41.020]
That's why he came on the show.

[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.240]
Becky called Shula douchebag.

[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:42.840]
You're done right.

[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.940]
He's pretty upset about it.

[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:44.300]
Exactly.

[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:45.140]
You sure?

[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:45.940]
You heard off the air.

[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.160]
Boy, are we doing...

[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.340]
For $1,000 donation, I got those tapes.

[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.060]
Are we doing pictures today?

[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:52.500]
I hope not.

[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.040]
Oh, Neil nobody can move here.

[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.540]
No, let's forget about the pictures.

[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:56.060]

[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:59.240]
I say you just buy your stuff and get the hell out.

[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.920]
Yeah, because we've got to turn these people over.

[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:04.260]
All of the problem with that is going to be what about the...

[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.320]
Oh, did we back ourselves into a nightmare here?

[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:06.760]
What?

[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.760]
What are we going to do about the drawing?

[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.640]
Because they've got to come back.

[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.000]
They have to be there to win the tickets.

[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:11.400]
I don't.

[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.300]
Do you think that they should be the case?

[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:13.980]
They can't.

[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:14.320]
They can't.

[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.420]
Just phone numbers.

[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.080]
We'll make sure everybody puts their phone number.

[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:17.520]
Okay.

[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:18.760]
Then they'll have to pick them up here.

[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.580]
They'll have to make a donation and we'll get back to them.

[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:21.960]
Great.

[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:22.380]
That's fair.

[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.200]
Okay, that's fair.

[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:23.600]
Okay.

[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:24.160]
What a guy.

[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:24.680]
Talk to you a bit.

[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:24.960]
Bye.

[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.120]
Well, I'm see we have to kind of make it up as we go along.

[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:28.740]
Because I didn't...

[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.400]
I mean, you look at the lot from the outside as you drive by.

[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.800]
And you figure, yeah, you get a few cars in there.

[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.720]
But quite frankly, it's not like exactly a macy's, you know what I'm saying?

[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.720]
But we'll work it out.

[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.420]
So get in there, buy your stuff, fill out the thing, drop it in a box,

[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.960]
and get the hell out of there, make room for some more people with some money.

[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.180]
And then we'll draw the names between two and three.

[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:47.540]
And we'll call you.

[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.320]
Don't call us.

[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:49.100]
And that's it.

[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.000]
Okay.

[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.900]
We have one open line indeed, one in Broward.

[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:52.800]
And get over there now.

[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.060]
And don't make us into a bunch of monkeys today.

[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.080]
This isn't some kind of a Zeta remote, okay?

[00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.440]
They're used to it.

[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.080]
This isn't a Power 96 Fiasco.

[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.400]
This is W-I-O-D.

[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.980]
You're happening doing it station.

[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:08.140]
So get your asses over to Flores and come loose with a cash and buy the t-shirts

[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.900]
and the tapes and the fill out the thing and cut the crap.
