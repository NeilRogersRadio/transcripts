[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180]
The fact that he used to be here twice and got screwed over by Cox broadcasting brutally a couple of times

[00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.200]
Or that he worked at QAM. We also got screwed over and they sent him that horrendous embarrassing registered letter that said

[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.340]
Get well soon and don't ever come back to work drop dead or that he worked

[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.820]
Several times in a market at the INZ and WNWS and

[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.120]
Because that's all the pressing. It's all in the past and we're here to look forward to the future like Saturday at called a race track

[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.620]

[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.480]
She said well, I've got it. I got to work. I got a little jappy, you know

[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.340]

How come oh we know all cars? How can we ever hear from those people?

[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.540]
I'm not complaining, but you know this when you come on the show you never hear from those people

[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.620]
I don't want to hear from them from Cocker Sydney. No, he's still a gonna send you some ballpoint pens

[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.820]
So to make up for the ten bucks

Anyway, it's 1013 to W.I.O.D.

[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.280]

I feel that people on one to one

[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.280]
Great. She's a wonderful person. What do you cut off?

[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.120]
Why do you cut all these people off?

[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.320]
You just like you have important crap to say and I don't want to take them all day

[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.360]
If we if we played all of these cards with sometimes I feel you wouldn't get to say ten words

[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.500]
I doubt if I get to say ten words anyway, but all here on the way home is Jews are come all the way over there

[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.420]
And you say anyway last time I'm here you said

What do you think about that bill?

[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.680]
I never wanted you some time to think it over because you've always been a slow starter

[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.860]
Always been very tentative and today he's gonna change that image. He's gonna let it all hang out

[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.940]
We'll be hearing from I'm gonna be my see from Hollywood's gonna call in today

[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.240]
And they don't even know what that is what is that I've never been in the cars

[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.080]
Oh

[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.540]
Anyway, it's not too bad of a walk from here to Pembroke Pines 1015 at W. I. O. D

[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.560]
The book should be out about 15 minutes before we get started Tom Denenberg you saw him you all my step

[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.640]

He came in here pleading what I please promote this and since it is already next Tuesday Tuesday night of next week

[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.600]
July 20th

[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.580]
What's the answer to the question? Okay, we were just exchanging some Larry King stories during the break

[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.340]
We'll save that for a little bit later on we save the best for last what's the Jeff Brooks story

[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.740]
And incidentally what what are some of the things I can say on the air about someone that we don't get in trouble

[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.800]
Pull could I call for example? Can I call them a liar? No, but you can say

[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.480]
I can't say that

[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.380]
You can say whatever the hell you want okay because it's my show

[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.020]
Do you notice how I keep looking at my mind doesn't like it? They can why if you got

[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.140]
No, I just I'm ready to avoid looking at him well

[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:54.860]
I worked with him and he got that little Nazi mustache one of the few people that ever laughed at my jokes

[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.520]
Well, you don't laugh at mine. I'll tell you that

[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:03.720]
Anyway Jeff wise hurt them all before Jeff braze at a story. We've got some Jeff braze stories too by the way

[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.340]
Jeff take a ray who much time off bill

[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.540]
Remember that I and see

[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:17.320]
Don't you remember that no you don't remember that when you're like mother-of-law died or something like that and you had to go with Mary

[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.320]
Suda Tampa and

[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.840]
Jeff braze you would take in a couple of sick days off or something and he said you're taking too much time off

[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:30.300]
Or say you don't remember that story that wimp that suckling Jeff Ray over at W.I. and Z

[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.660]
See still there. Oh, yeah, he'll be there forever

[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.280]
Him and Tim Williams

[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.100]
Anyway, we don't want to get into that. What's the Jeff Brooks story? Oh, I wanted to tell the Jeff Brooks

[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.560]
So I try to make it very quick because I know you have a lot of call

[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:42.700]
to

[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.860]
Jeff Brooks when you mentioned him on your show it brought back a tremendous

[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.060]
Is it not that does the car show the syndicate and is very good at it? Yeah, very good at it

[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.260]
crazy for a mechanic

[00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.980]
Former gas pumper at Hess at Tampa really?

[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:08.940]
Yes, he's the pump gas at Hess and Tampa and Dale Maybury at the state of WPLP are you serious a

[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.920]
Ditter show on the weekend and that's how it all started for him

[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.100]
But anyway to make a long story short my mother-in-law restaurant piece and my father-in-law

[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.460]
always wanted Mary Sue and I to be

[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.620]
Where they were and an opening came up at PLP and I got a call

[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.520]
in New Orleans and I took the trip down there and

[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:34.960]
agreed to do something I've never done before and I would never do again audition on the air audition on the air to

[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:44.720]
Dumbest most are you listening Randy the dumbest thing anybody can do because number one you're not really doing what they got in here boy

[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.000]
They're big on it here auditioning on the air. Yeah

[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.320]
Well, I'll explain it

[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.820]
Please we let me finish the star otherwise it'll go on and on and then you'll start putting me down

[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.920]
Anyway, I

[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.680]
Went down and did the show

[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:06.060]
And it was in the afternoon and I did it they asked me to stay another day

[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:12.580]
And I stayed and I was staying with my mother-in-law. She was hysterical God lover. She wanted us there so badly and

[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.380]
finally on Friday afternoon it was all over and

[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:23.440]
And I went home there was nobody at the station. I went home to my mother-in-law's house

[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.120]
sat around and I'll never forget it. She said what do you think?

[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:34.000]
I mean she was like she didn't understand this business anyway. She wants to know Tom Schaeffer and I said no

[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.220]
He used to say what do you think and I said if I don't get this job, Mertle

[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.900]
Then there is no reality. I said it's me and

[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:53.340]
And a mechanic a car mechanic. I was just thinking of an old guest of yours. I know go ahead and

[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.860]
I said if I can't beat out this car mechanic

[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.700]
I'm gonna get out of the business and she was just oh so happy in the phone rang

[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.960]
She picked it up, and I'll never forget her voice went hello

[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.300]
She was so excited

[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:16.280]
Yes, he's here just a moment and I got on the phone and it was the program director. He said Bill

[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.560]
I don't know to tell you this but Jeff Brooks got the job

[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:29.580]
I said you're kidding. He said no was two to one in favor of Jeff and I said why and he said because

[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.400]
He knows local politics

[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:39.760]
The guy was a mechanic so whenever I think of Jeff Brooks I always think about how he

[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.840]
Made my in-laws

[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.940]
Extremely unhappy. It's not a it's not a big story. Just never

[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.860]
I knew I shouldn't tell

[00:11:54.380 --> 00:12:01.180]
Well, I'm sure when I just then I'd slow it in anyway, he's a great mechanic and as part of you over

[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.180]
You messed up your career like so many others have done. No, no, no

[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:09.060]
It was just it was one of those it wasn't a great job and didn't pay a lot of money and

[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.960]
Never had that end. I've never had a job made where I would make money like safe you

[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:20.080]
I've never had that opportunity to really stick it to money is meaningless money and cars and all that

[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.420]
meaner. Sure

[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.240]
The public doesn't want to hear about people making a lot of money because most of them don't and they don't they resent it

[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.100]
They don't like I know I know I don't want to hear it. I hear it all the way down here

[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.340]

[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.220]
Numbers are coming out about five minutes the first roll of the numbers. Okay rapid fire

[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.720]
Ask me how I think who's gonna do what?

[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.820]
LQY LQY

[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.400]
Up riot radio

[00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.360]
WLQY

[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.500]
Lucky third w QAM QAM flat

[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.960]
What do you want to say something about them you entered you want to hold it off because I hold up first thing hold up

[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:17.060]
Yeah, until J gets in the car. No, it's just you know, you don't bite the hand that feeds you Neil or they still send you a check

[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.600]
Okay, I have a few things I'd like to say about them WFTL

[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.340]
flat the coast

[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.420]
Well, I have mixed feelings about the coast

[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.880]
I like the coast a lot and then all of a sudden they're starting to place some stuff

[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.900]
I don't yeah, I'm having a hard time. That wasn't the question though

[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.820]
Well, I'm gonna skip that one because I'm auditioning WNWS

[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.300]
Another enigma life

[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.780]
It's just a bowl of cherries kiss

[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.360]
Now they've changed the music at life

[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.580]
Yeah, just Collins is put a lot of vocals in there

[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.980]
Well, he says it's just changing to make and the old people's teeth are starting to rattle in the glass

[00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:01.180]
They're getting real nervous from all those vocals and I think they're gonna have some real problems

[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:07.260]
Because what Dennis starts sticking his finger and that's what my doctor told me he said once he starts sticking his finger and things look out

[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:14.880]
WIOD IOD I think it's just a wonderful place WINZ I and Z I used to work there. I was

[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:25.960]
This goes back WCG BCG. I love I'd love there's a sleeping power 96 power 96 lots of it hot 105 in the morning with Randy Martin

[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.140]
Keith Isley can pick him

[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:35.780]
I thought that was a micronirion in the morning now come you weren't that didn't call in on the micronirion's 15th anniversary last Friday

[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.620]
Because nobody asked me to him. Why can I wear never that close?

[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.160]
Who is? See that's how he stays here all the time. He's like distant. No, we never were that close. I mean I work great

[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:51.840]
I have a little kind of a loop. He's just he and I we never really uh hit it off hit it off

[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:58.020]
I mean we didn't not get along. I don't mean that but I mean it was never it was like a

[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.200]
It was like I'm never seen you start drinking that early in the morning anyway

[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:08.160]
Um, it's like me and your mom. Okay. Your mom has never your mom has no one really said about me

[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:15.480]
Mm-hmm Joy. Sure. Well, it's seven. Yeah, too far up on the dial. I never get up that far

[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.180]
um

[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.000]
KPX

[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.320]
WKPX pipe or high oh

[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:31.180]
I you'll never get down that one like that all the pinheads is and boy this guy's a still all right listen

[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:35.880]
I didn't come on here to try to convince everybody that I was 12 years old and that

[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.160]
You're out of it you're lost

[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.960]
You got a burble out and make a barnyard sound and whatever you say back at your butt load douchebag

[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.480]
That's where it's at today forget about all those pericolour

[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.340]
It is if there's any questions that the audience has about the inside

[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:56.860]
Working's of this business and especially Larry King if there's anybody in the audience who is owed money by Larry King

[00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:01.820]
Please call in immediately if not sooner. No, but where you line would like hold on go ahead

[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.180]
Nobody in this audience is owed a penny from Larry King

[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.840]
When you filed bankruptcy you don't know many more

[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.500]
Don't be trusted

[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:22.800]
Now if you borrow it after you yeah, well, that's okay if he borrowed money from your sincere file

[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.880]
Or case since the article in the Miami news that said how many perv underwear and how many socks he had remember that I love that

[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:33.040]
Stimpson at the time. I thought it was pretty cruel, but I looked back on it in retrospect. He deserved it and then some

[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.120]
What do you say to it? What do you say to it? Oh what you and he are always very close

[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:43.080]
In fact, uh if I were you this afternoon when I drop you off sit by the phone because Larry's got this important call

[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:48.500]
That you're going to be getting from Del Sharbert at Beachville. I'll tell you one thing about Larry one of many things

[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.860]
I'll bet and I don't know how you are and maybe it's stupid

[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.820]
But tomorrow I get a national television show

[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:07.160]
On CNN or ABC or anywhere else if it's two in the morning or three in the morning or eight o'clock at night or whatever it is

[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.600]
Who do you think would be my first guest

[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.280]
You

[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.800]
Take a guess Nelson Mandela

[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.500]
Well, you got half of it right. Okay

[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.040]
You oh

[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:26.640]
Because I'm the type of person that when I want to I just I would have to have you on you know what I'm saying

[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.720]
If you don't have any talent, I wouldn't have you on but I mean I'd have you on

[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.300]
He wrote a book and he told me bill

[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.380]
You'd only want to never stock by me but the fun

[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:46.280]
There's a whole chapter on you in there. There's a whole chapter on Joe Abernathy gave me my break back here in Miami

[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.280]
hired me when nobody else would cock strike in the fire him if they brought Larry back

[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.920]
He says too late a part of he stood up for Larry

[00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:03.400]
Well the book came out and I'm going to you know go nuts. I'm in a book

[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.680]
The whole chapter

[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.340]
Well, then I'm looking well. I guess I come after the Joe Abernathy chapter

[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:11.800]
Nothing

[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.780]
And I don't feel bad for myself

[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.840]
But I do feel bad for Joe because Joe is a guy that really stuck his neck out for Larry

[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.620]
And I used to stand by him and stand by him and stand by him but now

[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.680]
I've had it with him. He's he's a sleaze bag and

[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.300]
The lion

[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:31.600]
absolute

[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:37.560]
Unbelievable. I hope that somebody calls him tonight and tells him I said that

[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:42.480]
Yeah, tell him always bill is said at okan's that a neil because he used to my Senate and then I'll say

[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.620]
Bill called or I remember him. He used to work in his business. He'll say some shot like that

[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.940]
That's always best man am I wedding 15 years ago when I worked here Bob Gordon said in for me while I was

[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:57.100]
Getting married. Well, you and Bob Gordon are pretty tired. Yeah. Well our careers have crossed

[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.500]
He Lee and all that good stuff King Paul

[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.040]
King Paul is an awesome Paul. I'm sorry

[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.920]
Remember we're going to talk about the big WFTL breakfast with King Paul that almost slipped my mind

[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:12.180]
By the way, it gets Bill some toast. Ok any kind cinnamon toast now. No, that's I told that story already

[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:17.080]
That's the most incredible story and so typical of this business. I told it when I was on your show

[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:22.580]
Last time, but I don't I'd already told it before no you hadn't because I told it to you that day

[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.820]
No, I told it to be it's one of the few things left

[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:31.420]
I told it before it happened. No, I predicted it. Hello, Anna. Hello, Anna. God love you, hon

[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:36.180]
King Paul, but he got smart plan. They went back. They went back to what works

[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:37.640]
What's that?

[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:46.060]
Failure 1032 at W. I would be now one good thing. Okay, because I know everybody's kind of laying back because we only got a couple of calls

[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.780]
Are on the board. We're not going to take any for a long time anyway. Oh, yeah, I want to take some calls

[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.900]
So I don't want to just sit here and pump each

[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.000]
Hello, there's nobody on there any way in it. Hello

[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:57.680]
Yeah

[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:00.740]
Speak up

[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.940]
Get here. Yeah, put them all over. I'll put you on something. Rowered

[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.980]
Hello, Bill. All right

[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.220]
I remember you traveling man

[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:11.980]
Traveling man

[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.400]
Oh, by the way hold on a second. Do you know that yesterday

[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:24.640]
Yesterday, I you talk about embarrassing because I confused champagne lu and woody last Friday and I'm embarrassed by that because I'm pretty good on the voices usually

[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.800]
Yesterday that that stunk that super Dave calls a brick and a slut in the afternoon

[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:35.300]
Had them totally sucked in with a really ridiculous call. I had no idea who it was and then before the end of the call

[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.760]
He says how and I'm at home just seething and before the end of the call

[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:44.260]
He says how come you're always disin super Dave? Well, first of all, anybody says disin belongs in the institution number one

[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:49.700]
But and they still at that point never they got to the whole call and they never knew who it was

[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.600]
What is the first caller say the first one? He said

[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:59.260]
Boo like that. He's put me on hold. He said he's like something. I sound like Beauforteer. Oh, I thought he was putting me down

[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:05.020]
What is it Matt? I remember Bill from the grade entertainer

[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.780]
Back in the early 20s

[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.220]
Play in the records with Chuck C's though

[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.160]
No, that was seasonal have tell you're thinking of

[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:16.900]
Oh

[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.540]
It was skipper Chuck

[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.400]
No, it didn't be help

[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.960]
That was who it was yeah

[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:24.880]
Oh

[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:35.380]
Yeah, all right hold on a second. Okay, so I know you've got nowhere to go

[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.480]
1034 at W.Y.O.D. and I started to say a minute ago the best omen for the book

[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.760]
Now is it true that the numbers were starting to be fed at 10?

[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.560]
No, I know it takes time. I'm I'm not what

[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.160]
You're not listening to me though. The point is this

[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.860]
It's 1035 already the bad line has not run yet and Tanner isn't on the phone

[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:04.040]
The only time we hear from my close personal friend Bill Tanner is when we go in the toilet

[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.300]
Which is interesting because last several months in a row we've heard from Bill Tanner

[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:11.720]
But so far I don't see the bad line ringing it all that could be a very good sign

[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:16.420]
Good sign because the day without Bill Tanner is like a day without Anita man. It's great

[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.220]
Well, it's like why do I think of them like in the same like a form without Freddie Pearl exactly

[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.140]
Well, we're gonna have a lot to say when Freddie come calls in later

[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:30.540]
I'm sure and I guarantee he'll have a lot to say right now. No question about it 1035 at W.Y.O.D.

[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.000]
We'll come back Bill callers are very important special ratings day guest here at W.Y.O.D.

[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.360]
Thank you for the bodies are buried is gonna go in and punch Phil cost in them out during the break

[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:46.660]
Is Phil cost in still here you are gonna be amazed when you discover that we have new vending machines in the cafeteria downstairs

[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:52.840]
And the sodas are still only 50 cents and we have Phil cost in the tank for that so no mess with Phil

[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.580]
Oh, I never do I've known Phil alone time if you ever say anything about the Broward Mall again

[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.700]
Anyway governor was on before the show is over today

[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.840]
Where the hell is it?

[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.680]
Where's the saying? Oh

[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:15.960]
I don't hear anybody

[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.920]
Something heads 21 to 11 at W.Y.O.D.

[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.240]
That's becoming it's all because of Bill Carter

[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:33.100]
We have this gentleman here to thank today for a song that we sing in the shower while we're scratching our nose and

[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:37.680]
Just almost anytime just break out in the song well. There's a lot of things you could thank me for but

[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:43.280]
You're like we probably won't anyway let that you want to take another call because you lost traveling that with that

[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:47.900]
I'm not gonna establish anything about myself here. This mobile caller is gone. Aren't you?

[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.920]
I'm not gone. You're still there, huh?

[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:54.260]
I'm not paying for it too. Aren't I yeah, what you're used to that? Yeah, well

[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.520]
I had to lie and say I want to talk to Bill to get on but I want to ask you a question Neil

[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:14.880]

That's got to be the silliest thing I've ever heard in my life

[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.840]
Yeah, it's depressing to think that you would go down from Alex

[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.460]
Yeah, I didn't know it was possible

[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:49.080]

Okay, it's a long car. We don't want to play the whole thing is it's too depressing and we don't need any help today

[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.860]
It's 1106 at good old w-i-o-d

[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:37.420]
Hungarian Missouri because your mic's not on by the way because Marvin's busy talking with Henry

[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:42.040]
This is my gun. I didn't hear him. Sure now. It's not I wasn't on the beginning. You're not sure

[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:49.680]
You know slimeball. Okay, what is it four minutes? That's four minutes long about yeah, we don't have time for those you like

[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:55.320]
No, where I found that's yes sir in a gas station on the ground floor in a gas station

[00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:04.320]
John in between Austin and San Antonio. I was filling in for some people in both markets auditioning on here. No, and

[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.060]
That's why you're here today how you must have had advanced numbers

[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:15.660]
No, I'm not auditioning. I'll never audition again. I don't even I don't even know what I want to work again

[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.880]
Well, you sure don't want to work at w-i-o-d again

[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.300]
Well, you're just bouncing back from illness and you've been in a pretty good mood

[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:26.940]
The chances of my working at this station again minimal are minimal. Well, that's what we said about Stan

[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.240]
And he's on tonight by the way from 8 to 11 tonight

[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:36.000]
We just mentioned that because he's not about every so maybe you could get a deal like that be on like about once every two three weeks

[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.180]
No, I don't think so. I'm going

[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.100]
in a different direction

[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:42.780]
East I

[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.200]
Think what I think what we need now to solve the problem

[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.560]
I'm just I don't want to get into a big thing like I'm an expert because obviously I know nothing and we're afraid of this

[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.400]
I need to come on

[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:55.560]
This is very short. No, I should have come right away. No, it's brief like 60 seconds or less

[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.880]
What we need now is a lot more changes

[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:07.140]
Anyway, it's 1107 at w-i-o-d see that because they change more than more than you change your

[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:10.680]
Let me ask you a question. Yeah, while the news was on yes, sir

[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.300]
Did I make a comment about?

[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:20.080]
Numbers in the station and people did I make a comment that you felt was

[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.480]
Right to the ball don't do it during the break do it on the air right?

[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.000]
I don't know. I don't leave. Don't hold back do it on the air right now

[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.260]
You said that you weren't going to hold back and be the usual wimpy

[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.460]
I'm not a wimpy guy then let it out

[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:35.800]
You let it out

[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.340]
Well, you you know you put on this act every day

[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:49.560]
Yeah, you do you come on like you're really letting it all hang out? It's a big act

[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:55.220]
They ought to find out what you really think because I know that 15 years and

[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.420]
I know the real

[00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:01.900]
I know the real Nelson do you? Yes, sir Mandela

[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.020]
You want to take a caller to here? Yes, please

[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:11.200]
God, oh boy, you're off a lot of seeing like well. I just see you like this Jupiter. Hey Bill

Was that till with you then no? I replaced Ed till would you give you an idea where where my career is going?

[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:31.420]
Are you gonna go back or you go back? How far back can I go? I've gotten sick. I can hardly walk. I'm using a cane

[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:38.640]
I've lost 59,000 pounds and I'm not working. I can barely make the mortgage

[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:46.660]
And you're asking if I can go back go back where to what I've never never been like this before my life

[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:50.640]
Well, Ed till the program directing now of SMB

[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:05.400]
Ed Kaplan and Kaplan Mike Creezy is the program director there Ed Till is in Chicago at the loop

[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.800]
That's frightening. I know

[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:14.280]
It'll just show you how far Talon will get you. Yeah, you hear any rumors of Steve gang came going to SMB

[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.080]
Yes, yes, I did. I heard that just I heard it from you

[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.760]
Yeah, well, uh, Ron Hunter wanted to say hello

[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.680]
Yeah, so it is life, but she's in a chance

[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:30.260]
Central lockup wait a minute. Do you believe that Ron Hunter story? I mean all of us here in Miami

[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.020]
Many of us I should say remember Ron when he was a channel 10

[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:41.660]
Yeah, but I remember him on the Ron Hunter show from 12 to 4 on SMB on Saturdays or during the day, you know

[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:44.300]
And then remember he had the crime show at night

What do you think I brought him in here for just to eat lunch?

[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:45.300]
No, I think you brought him in there to console and just in case news wasn't too good

[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:50.840]
And it's interesting to note no, I brought him in here so he could talk to his good buddies in radio land like you

[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:56.200]
Okay, sir. I didn't bring him in here to code my hand. All right. We're doing him and it don't start yelling at the sky

[00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:04.520]
He's a nice guy. Don't don't kind of mop or I walk you must be another rick riley and drag. Okay. This isn't the bill called her that I know

For a forum that's right

[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:36.720]
Yeah, and unfortunately the man who discovered Gilbert as well. That's correct. Don't leave that out

[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.900]
And the man who gave John McHugh you depressed me

[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:47.620]
Oh god boy, you got a good memory forever for giving for that. Yeah, right thinking of radio drifter John McHugh lived in his car

[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:54.140]
Out the parking lot at wins John McHugh's a little old DJ who lived in a shoe. Yeah, the lowest voice in radio

[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.760]
Yeah, and what a remember is he always brought his wife with him

[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:02.780]
Yeah, and she was sleeping at the uh you drive it motel

[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:04.620]

[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.660]
Don't start all over

[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:22.840]
I know that he paid you a lot for this but let's not be carried away listening. What's right is right? In fact

[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:27.760]
We would be checking the line-up card tomorrow here at 610 you never know he might be penciled in

[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:32.640]

Say goodbye sir, I don't even take your theme. I mean and put their own name

[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.540]
1114 at wiod on ratings Wednesday

[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:51.540]
Remember a black Friday and dark Tuesday. This is ratings Wednesday now knowing what a even tempered even keel guy Rick

[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:52.780]
Riley is in the afternoon

[00:39:53.420 --> 00:40:01.440]
Can you imagine what kind of a show that's gonna be is he a big guy or a big guy big guy tough big enough to know better tough mean cries a lot

[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:08.540]
And the first one I think he's gonna I could be wrong because listen a couple of months doesn't make a career and

[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:13.620]
They're certainly proof of that but I'm telling you he was expecting big things in that book

[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:18.180]
I was expecting a little increase not much and we went down even more precipitously frightening

[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.700]
But he was expecting big things

[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.660]
That's a little early and they've only got like a three-week contract

[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:30.240]
So I'm probably be nervous today psychotics surly hostile, which is when he's good. That's when he's at his best

[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.500]
I want to meet the other guy puts

[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:36.980]
He's pretty good. He's the talent. Anyway, it's 1115 and dumb question about it

[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:41.860]
Anyway, it's 1119 at wiod bill and I have the definitive reason why some of these things are happening

[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.180]
But we don't want to go into a near because it would sound bad

[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.480]
Uh back at you. Okay, let's go

[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:52.500]

Look at that. Isn't that beautiful

[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.560]
He said that he hoped that Wayne Arnold would bring some stuff

[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:33.540]
Because he never had white hot. He hasn't had any of your food. He is going to be in for such a treat today

[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:34.980]
It's going to be shocking

[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:41.400]
Now am I right and fair rich his eyes lit up like a Christmas tree and I wonder if somebody I don't want to mention his name

[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:46.620]
Who just got kicked out of here? I wonder how long it'll take before he comes sliming back. Oh, I can't believe he's still mean to him

[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.840]
Birch beer now wait a minute. Do you know who's on the bat line? I have no idea

[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:58.920]
You are just gonna first of all the fact that he's calling on the bat line is so grotesque to begin with that

[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.380]
I have no words to describe it

[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:03.400]

You don't want to talk to him do about what what does he want to talk about? I have no idea

[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.780]
Well, I mentioned his name before he calls on the bat line because veneerie actually puts him on you

[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:38.720]
Like you know something about horse racing. Oh, which he doesn't know there's nothing about it

[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.980]
He knows how to borrow money at the track though. He's sorry, yeah, Sydney, but

[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.100]
Sydney believes that the thing that the

[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:46.860]

Of course it's a sesta they get those poor horses with yeah

[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:08.380]
What do you mean grotesque on the line the only thing grotesque is the last horse Neal gave me a call

[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.800]
Yeah, I'll give you I got a horse or a king of dance

[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:15.840]

It's delicious. Hey listen. This is could be the most exciting

[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:41.800]
They just take it in your mouth and don't ask for a life history on it. Okay, okay

[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.780]

[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:45.680]
It's no great loss. Well, no, I enjoyed you maybe not on that station, but I know I've been a lot better on other stations

[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:52.580]
Yeah, I enjoy we went through the remote up at Ricky's you had there. Oh really? Yeah, that's nice to be remembered

[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:55.860]
I was Neil said I wouldn't get one call that they would remember me

[00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.100]
I remember actually I when you were in the hospital

[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:01.360]
I had dropped off a tape of Patsy Montana. I was wondering if you

[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.580]
Oh, my favorite my favorite no no no

[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:10.440]
Well, down at Baptist Hospital, they wouldn't take it at the death. They said oh, no, you have to deliver it

[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:14.040]
I said no, I don't want to bother them, but they let me make leave it at the nursing station

[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.020]
He was she was on David Letterman of all people

[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:20.660]
That's right. I heard about that. Yeah, and I heard about that. Neil doesn't know who she is

[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:25.480]
You know, he's he's in to Deon and all the old rock and rollers

[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:30.220]
Yeah

[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:36.140]
Go ahead. You don't stop off on the roof by the drifters. I'm starting to hear about the Miramar diner

[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:43.400]
Yeah, yeah, and well, and after a lot of bill sponsors. Yeah, well, no, it didn't they closed after I left

[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:48.340]
Good talk of there. Do you hear that? I can't believe it. No, it's excellent

[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:54.380]
Now this is goes right on it. I heard sunny talking up wreckage this morning on the micronary show that was shocking

[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:56.440]
That was amazing. Well, he does a good job

[00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:01.940]
He's a great guy because I'm vacation who's sunny. Oh, I touched on my mic

[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:04.880]
Just now how is it? Did you eat anything in or are you just?

[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:13.040]
Okay, so let's so Monday we go back to serious topics here. This is all over the parties over

[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:17.720]
Okay, well, I thought I'd give it a little bit more. I thought we would bounce back thanks to Rick and putz

[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:22.660]
I thought they were going to be the salvation method. They were going to be like Jesus and drag and they turned out to be more like

[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:29.800]
Monty Python. Yeah, I think like you had you pinpointed it when you said when you were out ill when they someone was covering for you

[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.040]
That all the butt loads and back edges

[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:36.740]
I think that's well, they're just too much too much of this pinhead

[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:42.780]
douchebag stuff, you know, especially just lost its focus. Well those hard hitting topics lost its focus group

[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:49.380]
We'll get them with those hard hitting topics. You bet. Okay. Okay. You have thinking float lady because the way and thank you very much

Okay, it's like Jews when somebody dies. They have a party and everybody eats a lot and the book just came out

[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:18.320]
We're doing the same thing. Okay. I bet you they are really grim up there

[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:22.620]
But we're gonna have a lot of executive meetings a lot of gnashing of teeth a lot of hysteria. Am I right?

[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:40.240]
Upper and middle-level management people who know that the end is near and that they better fire everybody else first before they get there

Incredible phone callers who's got a lot to say and is not afraid to say it

What does that mean? I'm not being precipitous, am I?

[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.620]
Well, I just said it because we were discussing you the other day as a matter of fact of the track

[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:07.520]
And we agreed that you have got a lot to say you don't beat around the bush you come right out you tell it like it is

[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:10.220]
You're not boring and well, I wouldn't say that

[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:12.960]
You're not

[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:17.600]
We also like your smooth steady style that's the cato like a rapid-fire delivery

[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:22.480]
What they do you want your show sir? How about Sunday would be good. I don't like that. You don't like what

[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.080]
That's snow cone

Oh cone what do you guys doing in there?

[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:32.580]
What the hell? So last time we ever invite this guy back on a show don't start telling us what you don't like

[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:34.840]
Tell us what you do like who me no

[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:40.040]
Wayne Arnold just brought four thousand dollars with the food in here. It is give me don't like his snow cone

[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:45.640]
Did you really have a snow cone? No, he doesn't have a snow cone. He's got a cup with too much ice in it. That's all

[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.800]
Was the white hot bill

[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:56.240]
I can't believe it built called reading on the year in the studio. Yeah, and Neil Roger. I'm never feeding him again

[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:59.400]
He is such a grouch. Yeah. Well listen. What can I say you know?

[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:02.880]
That's how those guys are castle burgers too by the way

[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:05.560]
Have something that's right like before you're finished now. What's the story?

[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:10.060]
Steve whatever the hell your name is yeah, so we're bringing Steve came back on Monday

[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:14.880]
We're gonna have the year-end lady on Tuesday and mom have the so you emulating the you em lady

[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:20.180]
Yeah, uh, Neil may I say something? We're in every place of you and basketball all during the rest of the summer

[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:25.160]
We're gonna get back to what really has always worked here at W.I.O.D. You know what it's called Steve? What's that failure?

[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:29.120]
Failure. You know what I think is happening right now. I think you're overreacting

[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:35.360]
Who me yep you well? I'm just reacting the way I know that management reacts because they had like six trends that have gone in the toilet

[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.640]
Narrow and they're just not gonna sit back to well

[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:41.500]
You know, let's just wait another month. They're gonna say up everybody's doing a lot of things wrong

[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:46.320]
And we better start interfering like crazy before we're out on the street. Don't mess with success

[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:54.120]
What success? Well, okay, I'll accept that when W.I.N.Z. ties you know that the hand writings on the wall as Daniel would say

[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:59.360]
It's all over with we're finished. We're done. Wow nice run. We had a good time and I enjoyed it

[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.780]
Listen don't don't don't sound a death knell yet Neil

[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:07.040]
Why do I sound depressed? I hate listen. I've become the last few months. I've become philosophical

[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:10.920]
It's like getting caught in a web of mong as somebody I know will say

[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:14.840]
What it is like getting caught on the Titanic like on the lower level, you know

[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:18.700]
Raging deck there. They all go down together. How do I sound today Steve?

[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:20.980]
Terrific bill with your mouth. Well, that sounds great

[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:22.160]
Hello

[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:28.620]
When Steve from Hollywood starts taking little shots at you. You know that the put all over it. Yeah, the

[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:32.480]
Spickel Bill knows that I'm just saying it in jest. You know so much. I love him

[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:35.420]
And I really admire his style as a person and as a personality

[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:38.980]
I personally think that the ratings are fixed if you want to know the truth. I've been

[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.660]
Didn't want to say that for a long time

[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:46.280]
But I think basically that the arbitrage on somebody is being paid off and there's the fixes in

[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:49.060]
Well, I don't know if you can go that far but if you're serious

[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:53.020]
I think what happens is as either you or one of the other guys will want on the station put it out

[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:57.000]
That a lot of the people to get those those diaries either don't know what the hell it's all about

[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.360]
They just sent them in because they feel they know

[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:07.560]
It's a seven and he loves the book. That's right. He thinks that the book should be put. What do you got?

[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:12.480]
Huh? What do you got? What do you mean? Just what I said? What do you got? What's your number?

[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.660]
Come on Neil don't be so cruel. I'm just well listen

[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:24.240]
I can even with them don't I? No, no, no you don't okay. Why is you feel this compulsion to beat the hell out of everybody that disagrees with you?

[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:27.780]
Because it's fun well also it's because he's lashing up there. You said earlier

[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:32.380]
He's sort of he's sort of taking the back by the ratings and I think he is taking a back

[00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:34.280]
That was at Zeta and they're still going down

[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:36.460]
The T.Rs off here. They're still going down

[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:40.200]
So if you think we're doing poorly, how are they doing? I'm not saying anything about being precipitous

[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.100]
I'm just making observation. I think that I think maybe you're overreacting a little bit Neil

[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:48.140]
Okay, don't get too serious. So a week from Monday. I'll start there with the topics

[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.560]
Okay, that's it delay of the week listen. I don't want to interrupt your dinner

[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:52.820]
I just get that nutritionist on Monday by the way

[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:57.880]
Let's get Jane Donigan with the freaking wig in here and all Sandy's old guest. Well most of them are dead by the way

[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:02.080]
I'm about out of material. I just thought I thought I was still on her show. I mean you were out of material

[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:03.920]
You didn't have any material well

[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:06.720]
Listen I can't get a word in between while wait a minute wait a minute

[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:11.140]
We never check to see how sandy and Debbie did okay? Wait a minute hold on now

[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:17.580]
Because Alice went up a little bit to a three four Alice went back to topics. So maybe we better start following analysis

[00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:18.320]
slippers

[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.520]
Do you want to do it Alice?

[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:26.360]
Unlikely. Let's see here we go. W's news midday two six to a two six

[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.200]
Not too exciting there

[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:33.820]
Well, we only got a force of what the hell are we talking about you know what they say yeah, what goes around now

[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:38.340]
Let's see 12 plus let's look at the sandy patent go round okay any afternoon Steve

[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:42.020]
That's one of your favorites, isn't it what's that sandy two wonder with two oh

[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:45.020]
No, she didn't give any prizes, so I don't bother calling you anymore. Oh, okay

[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.160]
I'm one of those I'm one of those snorered types

[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:53.000]
Well, I said Steve that's all we have to report. It's wonderful hearing from you. You're okay in our book. Don't be

[00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:55.760]
Not neurotic, okay? Okay. I won't be psychotic

[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:59.880]
Don't think it also personally like you used to in writes bill all those psychotic letters

[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:05.200]
Come on Neil I was just a radio show. I only wrote in one letter and that was a long time ago

[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:08.960]
And that was not psychotic or neurotic, but it was right on target. It was pathetic

[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:13.860]
That's the word have a great day. You two Neil so long Bill. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Have a nice meal

[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:14.640]
Sure

[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:22.380]
By the way, and we have another Alex Bennett the thing here. This is out of the examiner out of the real paper in San Francisco

[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:26.560]
Bad Alex Bennett bounces back in the gay Bay area

[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:32.420]
It says from his first day in Miami Bennett was made to feel unwelcome. Oh

[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:35.040]
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let me go back up a bit

[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:39.160]
Miami the venue and the market turned out to be anything but nice the worst place

[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:41.620]
I've ever lived in Bennett doesn't mind saying just miserable

[00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:46.760]
But they do have strange and selective tolerances there even though they've banned two live crew and Tonga bathing suits

[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:51.120]
From his first day in Miami Bennett was made to feel unwelcome mostly by people at his own station

[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:59.160]
And mostly on the air very strange says Bennett the guy who came on the air before me was the radio star of the town a guy named Neil Rogers

[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:03.780]
Well, he's that's ancient history right off. He started bashing me on the air making fun of everything

[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:08.480]
I did I never heard of someone on your station going on the air you're going on the air to say you suck

[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:13.120]
Then everyone on the station joined in it was one of the most impossible situations. I've ever been in

[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:15.300]
I went to management to ask them to stop it

[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:17.680]
They said they couldn't that it was a freeform radio station

[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:23.380]
Finally I started blowing my stack on the air. I walked into this guy's studio during a show told him if I wasn't such a nice guy

[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:24.480]
I would punch him in the nose

[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:31.020]
Then I don't have the carton machine. Isn't that a bad break after three months in Miami

[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:33.700]
Bennett was suspended by the station and he walked out

[00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:36.360]
I felt so terrible that my girlfriend and I drove to New York

[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.580]
And I'm sure I didn't say a word for a thousand miles

[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:44.980]
And it goes on and on and fetching and bitching and moaning and we're going to start doing just like he does

[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.040]
We're going to blame everybody else for our failure. Okay

[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:51.440]
If it wasn't for that goddamn Henry Barrow and at 11 o'clock news we'd have a seven

[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:54.980]
Anyway, it's 23 till noon

[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:56.360]
what

[00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:03.580]
News for drunks and with summer here what better way to cool off them with a great tcb anyway

[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:07.400]
Let's take another call build callers here. He's in a good mode. He's having a lunch

[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:10.660]
And you have some Arnold burgers some England burger. No, I'm gonna have one of those next

[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.200]
Let's the mobile's gone they give up on us his Eric

[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:23.280]
How's it going Neil? Okay, Eric. What's up? Is this Eric come a row? No, this is your valley parker Eric at the track

[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.740]
Oh Eric thanks for pulling up close to the curb

[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:31.740]
Yeah, holy and if I ever have a winning day Eric then you'll see what a real big tip is so to speak

[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:34.640]

[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.560]
Yep, be happy with that 50 Eric

[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:41.840]
And don't spend it all in one place so we're gonna come out Saturday again to celebrate the great ratings we had today

[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:45.960]
I won't be a Saturday like I said we're coming Sunday

[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:49.420]
What would you mean you're not gonna be there? No, I got

[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:55.920]
I work at UPS the nightlife at softball tournament up in Melbourne. You have a what softball tournament?

[00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:59.720]
Eric, I think your priorities are all screwed up

[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:04.480]
Because I have that shiny hundred dollar bill in my wallet that I have put in that special section

[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.060]
That of course is my gambling money. Yeah

[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:10.040]
Your gambling money seems to be diminishing at the

[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:16.420]
You're going to the track rapidly. We neither one of us cashed a ticket as a matter of fact. Yeah, I heard yeah, what's good?

[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:23.340]
So when you're gonna be back Eric? I'll be back Sunday Sunday. We were going Sunday this week anyway

[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:28.080]
Right bill. Yeah, yeah, we were thinking about that. Isn't that a funny omen? Well, no, I don't like going there and

[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:34.420]
Bringing him in his weekend condition and just having anybody open the door and carry him in and like you do

[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:36.420]
Yeah, we want to make sure that you're there Sunday

[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:41.000]
So that's why you really called right Eric right because you want to make sure we don't come when you're not there

[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.320]
I want to make sure you're taking care of me. You need that 400 bucks, right?

[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:48.240]
You want to make sure I'm taking care of? Yeah, well, we can discuss that at the car

[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.600]
Now we'll see you Sunday Eric all right and go cubs

[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.120]
Okay, all the way good luck

[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.780]
Bye, bye good kid

[01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:00.960]
Good wise guy, but good kid. Let him 43 now. He's all right. So we're just kidding Eric. We're just taking it out

[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:06.140]
We're lashing out at everybody. Okay, how come we get women 25 to 54? Oh, that's for the coast now

[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:13.040]
And that big mouth fat slob Johnny dark was just an area. Oh, they did the breakout. We beat all the AC stations in June

[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.320]
So well, of course, they're gonna go through the roof over there

[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:22.640]
Which I hope happened soon to take the heat off of us. Okay, we've supported them long enough during all those struggling days of GTR when it we didn't like to

[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:25.040]
They'll kind of a number is that

[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:30.620]
Although I guess Jay Michaels would kill for it sunrise. Yeah bill called her

[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:38.580]
Yes, sir, sorry to interrupt your lunch. No, it's over. Now he's digesting now. However, I have in my position as we speak a

[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:47.420]
promotional photograph of about 20 years ago of you standing on park Avenue apparently trying to hail a cab without much success

[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:50.500]
Uh, this is from W. H. N

[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:56.840]
My god 50 on your dial in New York City now currently WF a N I believe

[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.380]
I miss him the morning as a matter of fact

[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:01.440]
Yeah, where did you get that?

[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:04.180]
She always living in Stet Nile in New York at the

[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:10.020]
For this along with pictures of our here some names for you to remember her boss Miranda sent

[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:15.540]
Bruce Bradley Bob fit Simmons Bob Jones Dean Hunter

[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.480]
Oh my god

[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:22.340]
The late Lonnie star Lonnie star you still weekends

[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:27.080]
I thought that would kick in some memories for you here. Oh, that's terrific

[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:31.300]
6 to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday. I don't remember what you did on the weekends

[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:36.720]
But one of the highlights of most of the evening programs was the Willie birds remember the Willie bird

[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:42.180]
Going up to I guess it was Westchester or Connecticut to check out the herbace Miranda's in farm for the

[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:44.320]
The evening taking out of the garbage

[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:48.060]
Oh my god, yeah, I did a bit where I

[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:53.900]
flew over all simulated over her buskers house for the emptying of the garbage and you heard that

[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:58.300]
trumpets blaring and here came her but his robes and the

[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:02.520]
garbage bearers and all that stuff. Yeah, that was a good bit

[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.260]
Yeah, I guess that my wife I guess how to use that again, huh?

[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:06.560]
Take another shot with it

[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:12.120]
Call it the Neil Rogers emptying of the garbage here he comes out part of by two dogs and uh

[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:16.180]
Oh little tiny has um just a little bag of garbage ship

[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.460]
It's cute. Mm-hmm

[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:24.180]
Okay, well listen things were different then people were having fun on the radio

[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:28.800]
And not anymore we're stopping as of right now. I'll tell you that and we're off to a good start

[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:33.980]
Those are the good old days. Yes, sir. Well, you can't the go back. You know, you can't relive the past

[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:37.940]
That's true. No, Dylan Carly. We're not successful in catching that cab you were looking for

[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.460]
No, I never did catch it until it was too late

[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:45.680]
I don't know if that's significant of anything. Yeah, did I have a white raincoat on yeah and white gloves

[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:52.280]
Okay, now that comes from a picture called funny face with Fred Astaire and um what was her name um

[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:55.620]
The little French girl and it was like her own

[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:58.040]
Leslie Karoon and

[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.500]
All the way through the movie war white raincoat

[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:06.920]
That I went nuts for and at a hard time finding and finally found it and I think I'm wearing it in that picture

[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.400]
But right

[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:12.200]
Yes, sir and I was doing a lot of dancing then

[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.520]
Thought tap dancing in radio

[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:27.060]
Okay, that's the kind of stuff that got us that four-year sir

[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:31.880]
So I don't think you'll hear too much of it after today. Okay. We're going back to getting serious. I probably don't feel okay

[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.420]
Take care. Neal. Take care Bill. Okay, let him 47 at W.I.O.D

[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:39.760]
So all your pinheads all you slime balls that have dragged this down into the a muck and mire with you

[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.940]
It's audio's right starting tomorrow

[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:46.220]
It's heavy duty World War III talk on six ten your

[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:51.660]
Combat station W.I.O.D. So you're gonna be one combat boots. I got to say one thing. Yes

[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:53.300]
I've heard you do topics

[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.580]
Which all of a sudden? I don't know why it became a dirty word because you're doing topics every day

[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:02.760]
It's just of a different kind just that they don't talk about them. That's all oh

[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:08.420]
You don't announce that you're doing a topic, but you still give an opinion on something exactly like 20 different subjects and they never respond to them

[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:09.320]
They got their own agenda

[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:15.140]
You have done some subjects that we're not boring that we're not you know chiropractors or

[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:19.160]
That kind of thing. I mean you've done some shows that were pretty

[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:25.220]
Pretty in entertaining not lately. No

[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:28.360]
And

[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:34.120]
What's the point? I forgot now I've got a word in it and you didn't interrupt me. I forgot what I was

[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:38.760]
What is the panic? I don't understand. There is no panic, sir

[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:44.120]
No panic at all looks no fun if you can't panic look Neil you've got to relate to see when you do well

[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:49.180]
Then you savor and when you do poorly you panic doesn't only two ways to react if you just like blasey

[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:53.300]
It's no fun. No, but there's no panic. Let's relate this to baseball. Yeah, exactly

[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:58.280]
That's what the toe does. I remember don't panic. Exactly. Let me say by the way don't come back next week's him

[01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:04.520]
Let's get down to graph pack. Yeah. Okay, you relate to baseball. Okay, you're on injured reserve

[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:06.820]
It came off injured reserve

[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:11.840]
And simple you're just in a slump just a slump. No, I'm not in the mean slump

[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:15.740]
I'm doing just fine, but the audience said doesn't want this anymore. Okay, they want something else

[01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:21.100]
They want somebody else. They want to want to be Alice. I think Paul is probably oh my god

[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:25.000]
He's in Buffalo so they're not going to get him. I rather have to they want something else

[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.720]
See I know I'm not gonna see to apologize for the show because I do the best show in the market

[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:32.820]
There's nobody even close okay, and I don't want to be the one to say it but certainly nobody else well

[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:35.460]
Especially Bill Tanner who just loves to rub it in

[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:42.740]
I knew this for a Tanner was great on why 100 but on power 96 it's just the stupid pre-pubescent the pinhead show

[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:46.820]
Neil does not knock in that because there's room for a stupid

[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:52.100]
Pinhead pre-pubescent show in this market especially for ethnic pre-pubescent pinheads

[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:56.560]
That's what they do on power 96 they panders shamelessly and he admits it

[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:01.280]
No need to worry the ratings will be back up soon. No need to worry

[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:04.940]
What is that supposed to mean the ratings will be back up soon?

[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:11.840]
Very soon look at this here's mid-days and wio. This goes back to spring of 89 a six three last summer a seven

[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:17.380]
Fall a six winner a five one spring out today a four oh

[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.840]
Four oh they could have Alan Burke here and do a third of that

[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:25.200]
This to be a favor Neil don't let Johnny dark back in the studio

[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.580]
I'm sure he doesn't understand that I'm serious. He's a creep

[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:34.460]
He's climbing over a creep he comes in here and starts muscle and all he comes into the building and he's like

[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:36.840]
Mr. He just takes over the whole place

[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:37.860]
Oh man

[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:42.640]
He starts pulling and grabbing everybody's goddamn food and sticking his finger up your nose and just everything

[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:45.400]
What do you got it? He wants it and I guarantee you right now

[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:51.140]
My big dog got something that he's gonna get tomorrow too by the way and little sack from Wayne Arnold I guarantee

[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:54.260]
I get a foil I guarantee he's on the phone with the bird right now

[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:59.640]
Guarantee and they're just in there. Ah, ah, ah, he's gonna go out of a two and that's come. Hey, he'll be out of his ass

[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:03.760]
And I'll be working in in canondag with New York like to yet. I sure

[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:10.620]
Look a couple of old fish wives. That's it. That's it. Have a great day. I do. I feel a lot better. Oh, you're gonna be everything's fine

[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:13.740]
Everything's just fine. Remember the last guy you said that

[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:15.020]
See you later

[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:20.520]
What let's go. I don't know. Oh, I mean, who is it like I know these callers personally

[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:24.940]
That's bad when you start knowing every caller personally. It means you don't have many callers

[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:29.840]
No, no, but you seem to know him. I just thought maybe he sounded like a broadcaster

[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:33.660]
Better nice for Jack McDermott

[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:37.180]
It's nine till noon to do you want to repeat that? No

[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.560]
Well, why do you want to say all the good stuff off the air?

[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:42.060]
It's not good stuff

[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:46.740]
You have you only said the good stuff. Well, first of all, I'm not a kind of a wimp

[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:52.000]
Not a radio maven. I you know, I don't know what he said was he said that there's something

[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.200]
How was well? How did you phrase it?

[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:58.200]
Okay, I said and I was going down a list of

[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:04.500]
of different groups of people on the air over a period of time in this market and I said they all

[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:07.940]
Uh had something that kind of

[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.200]
held them together. There was a certain

[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:18.880]
All warmth the certain fun a certain something but a certain identity too. Yeah kind of a right identity and

[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.260]
I think that's one thing that

[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:26.300]
The station needs here is it has an identity, but it's

[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:30.780]
Now everybody's like going off in so many different directions

[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:34.160]
All attempting to do the same thing

[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:36.740]
That's all Neil junior

[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:39.960]
Well, I'm not sure exactly whether that

[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:44.740]
Would be the way I'd put it, but um, that's the way you said it off the air anyway

[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:46.920]
56 and w.i.o.d. Let's go to

[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:50.220]
Well because of actually if we hold on hold on. He's not finished

[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:53.640]
If you take if you take everybody on the air here Neil

[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.000]
Yeah, and put them in an incinerary none of them

[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.060]
Are doing anything remotely close to what you're doing. Yeah

[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.480]
So can't really say we're all failing

[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:13.960]
So I'm trying to be serious. Yes, sir. It's not me. I'm just a flighty happy guy correct. Yes

[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.940]
Hi, no, yeah

[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:18.760]
I

[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:23.740]
On this last one April May and June sir

[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:24.820]
1990

[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:26.680]
You have all over

[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:35.500]
You're what I was working for hr.s about six weeks or so ago at two separate residences one highly and one little Haiti

[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:36.400]
I saw

[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:39.620]
diary instruction

[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:47.180]
books out in the place and just not being used at all and I wondered what areas do the how many thousands do they send out in this market?

[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:51.060]
2000 2000 so there's one per every thousand people roughly

[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:56.420]
Uh, so what I'm doing. How do you figure that there's four million people and they'd rowered in Palm Beach

[01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:02.640]
Yeah, but I'm just figuring like how health has two people in the right one envelope. Oh how many households? Okay

[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:07.280]
But um, so what I'm just ignoring the representional couple thousand people. Yeah

[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.200]
And

[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.740]
If it's going strictly to a Hispanic or a

[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:17.420]
We can't keep by using that routine. I mean, you know, we've always we've always had the same factor

[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:21.900]
There've always been the same number of Spanish language stations and always that same kind of fanatic loyalty

[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:25.960]
That's always been a given so when we did very well we were up against the same mentality

[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:30.680]
So what you know, you can't keep finding excuses the fact is we suck, okay

[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:31.780]
Following

[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:41.420]
I mean, I realized we had that great promotional campaign back in the wintertime with those male outs with

[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:44.240]
There any reason a picture with his finger up his nose that really did it

[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.800]
Of course these billboards. I think are what put us over the top

[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:50.860]
I don't think we could have achieved this level of numbers without the current billboard campaign

[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:57.400]
And personally who was up to me I would bring Sandy Tinsley in here on the air and just blow off a bomb in the building

[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:00.100]
And I would solve a lot of our problems like in a little in a little room

[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.040]
But I mean I mean

[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.160]
Sure, have you seen our billboards?

[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:07.220]
And I think the one of my hair is terrible

[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:08.720]
The one of what?

[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:14.620]
Well, they're all the same. There's I mean, there's no one that's better or worse. I mean just a matter of degree

[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.400]
Just the question of who's got the biggest ugly teeth

[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.820]
But I wasn't bird that the controversy over was just a just

[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.760]
Just charging a bird or whatever you want to call them

[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.960]
That was that also in the spring time

[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.280]
No, no the birth of a gone since December

[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.220]
And then what about the Alex Bennett

[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:40.160]
That's well he was only here a month of this okay. You can't blame it all on him

[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:46.060]
Like to but we can they were here for two thirds of it so it's mostly their book don't you understand that?

[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:47.640]
Thank you

[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:52.180]
And he also filled in for two weeks while I was out sick to in a couple of weeks or then

[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:57.600]
There's a good part of both time periods that are their book. I don't want to lay it on their shoulders because Rick Riley are coming here and cry

[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:02.260]
But we all have to share in it together so we're all responsible for this

[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:08.540]
Desperate dismal failure for the sliding numbers for the demise of the current management team

[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:15.140]
For all of the really depressing morbid tones that are coming through your radio right now and you know what?

[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:16.060]
Tough

[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:22.280]
Okay, we got Chuck Meyer here with the new WIO knee-nose Chuck son a good modi's going to Chicago with us if we're still here

[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:32.740]
Attention came on shoppers. We have a lost little girl

[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:37.760]
She's 19 years old all burn hair green eyes

[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:43.760]
36 24 34 and answers to the name event

[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:47.900]
She said she lost her daddy and needs a new one

[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:56.520]
Will all prospective daddies please form a double line outside the manager's office and please have a recent

[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:01.180]
Bank statement or stock portfolio with you. Thank you

[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.960]
Sometimes

[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:17.780]
Sometimes I feel

[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:19.960]
Like people

[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.220]
You show

[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:31.480]
Like a child

[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:36.200]
You can help me get by my friend

[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:39.600]
They'll call her on radio

[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:43.620]
They'll call her on a radio

[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:46.700]
Maridio

[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.320]
Okay, mr. Carter is

[01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:56.900]
Um

[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:05.020]
207 at WIOD on a wonderful Wednesday. Hey listen. We're not going to be bothered by these little let the

[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:09.820]
People who get paid to be in management worry about all these things and figure out all the answers because they've had to

[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:14.540]
They've had so many answers already since I've been here that got only knows they can only make it worse

[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:22.300]
Uh anyway, here he comes straight from his appearance at the guest room at the Ramada Hilton on the corner of 79th and this game

[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:24.200]
What is it?

[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:27.360]
Somebody knocked over what?

[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:34.460]
Your cup oh nice some slob was in here just the mung doll over the place. Oh boy

[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:35.420]
Kendall

[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.440]
Hello, yes, sir

[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.720]
Yes, I want to talk to build

[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.340]
Bill uh, Alder

[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.060]
Are you sure now? Yeah, uh, I'm

[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:51.060]
Okay, well the way you said it we're kind of like tentative on his name

[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:56.040]
Yes, they're called her if you'd sit down in that chair and not worry about the if it's wet

[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.320]
That's the way it goes. Okay, it goes with the territory

[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.340]
This gentleman would like to speak with you. Can we get you to do that?

[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:08.280]
While he's dawdling he does what he's doing what he does best or he's dawdling and stalling around share

[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:10.360]
I'll take care of that. She's very good at that

[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:13.260]
He's still standing

[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:16.600]
I don't even want to say it

[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:17.180]
Hello

[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:24.720]
Hello, I'm dying over here. Okay, see I knew that if we waited a lot of it was he said he can't wait to hear you speak

[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:29.040]
Margate hello. Yeah, let's just pick the bill call there. Yes, sir

[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:32.860]
Bill called or um, you guess that you have today

[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:36.920]
Uh, want you when you leave the studio?

[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:41.240]
Why don't you just drop off your resume and application? I'm sure they'll be evaluated

[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:45.980]
As of the ratings this morning. Yeah

[01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:49.940]
You know, I'm a first time caller great

[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:55.180]
Are you sure you're gonna say are you paying any attention? This or are you still worrying about that coffee on the table there?

[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.940]
Call her just a little bit you can't

[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.720]
You're always been there with your little little things throw you okay?

[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:04.600]
You can't worry about that like when your horse falls down in the middle of the backstretch

[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:09.140]
You can't worry about things like that you have to just keep moving on. I want to thank Cheryl for

[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.240]
Forget about Cheryl. Okay. Cheryl is in the world of her own right now

[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:17.240]
She's in for a tough week call for you know, it's for you. Oh good morning

[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:22.220]
He's already finished saying what he had to say. What did you have to say? Go ahead sir

[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:25.720]
Uh, long time listening of yours. Thank you

[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:29.780]
Where you on when you you went dig Wilson with together

[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:37.700]
You're listening to it right over you i.o.d. Oh, okay, and sandy pecan was on that at the time. No, she was on a1a then

[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:42.660]
Oh, okay, but then when I came back to when I came back the second time sandy was on

[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:44.900]
Oh, okay, I

[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:49.940]
I think that's greatest time. They've ever tried to listen to her. I'm a service truck driver

[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:55.860]
And I used to pull over the side of road lacking so hard with you and big Wilson. Yeah, well, I'm a funny guy

[01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:57.080]
Well, so I'm sure

[01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:01.300]
Not anymore though, and I'll tell you something interesting you bring up a point sir

[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:05.980]
A lot of people say my doctor has said go back to work go back to work go back to work

[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.080]
And you know something

[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:11.080]
I'm not sure what I want to go back to work because

[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.120]
With just a couple of exceptions

[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.520]
It's it doesn't seem to be as much fun anymore everybody seems to be like

[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:22.660]
I can't even think of a word for it, but uh

[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:27.280]
I don't know like just over the last couple of years it's gotten

[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.820]
I don't know kind of too professional too commercialized too professional. No, not too professional

[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:37.900]
It's just yeah, I don't know it's just not as much fun. I don't hear as much fun on the year

[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:41.500]
I punch around and now I'm not working you know, I have time to listen

[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:47.900]
Yeah, I'm outside of rick and suds. That's it. Yeah, that's the only thing to listen to now. No, I listen to them

[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:53.880]
I listen to you gonna start in on them now. No, I do I listen to them. Yeah, and

[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:58.600]
They're great. I agree with you. They're gonna do it and they're kicking ass and

[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:04.960]
So I wanted to tell you your playing his tongue so hard that there's blood all over his dead years and all over his

[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:05.660]
forehead

[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:13.960]
Me and Neil yeah, that would really me as his sidekick would be like

[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:20.260]
Maybe one day every six months would be good. Not too much. Have a great day sir

[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:22.700]
Thank you. We've had some great moments. So we've we've been

[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:27.040]
Winds was the best. Yeah, I was doing eight. We had night bill was doing midnight to five in the morning

[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:32.820]
We had the cross over that's see we were having fun having fun and I at periods have had a lot of fun here too

[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:37.760]
And lately I've been having fun here again, but the only problem is then this stuff comes out and you look at it

[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.740]
You say I don't believe it because like everywhere we go everything we do we have these enormous turnouts

[01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:46.200]
I'm not talking about just pimple-headed geeks, but I mean like

[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:51.220]
You know living in the shoe store at 79th and that was exactly man. That was fabulous

[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:52.320]
um

[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:58.900]
No, but really we have like at the ballgame and at all these remotes and everything we do in the sponsors just get tremendous results

[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:05.520]
And so if we if we were like losing the audience like flies like this stuff would indicate to you

[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:09.440]
There would have to be some barometer that something go along with it and it's not there

[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:15.880]
It is just you don't feel it you follow what I'm saying. Yeah, so but you can't keep saying for if you're gonna talk about ratings on here

[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:20.480]
Which I've always done you can't find excuses forever. You can do it for a couple of trends or something like that

[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.380]
But you can't do it for six or seven months

[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:27.700]
You have to say well, I guess that's that's ancient history now. Let's go on to the next thing, you know

[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:30.960]
What is the next thing

[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:38.980]
Well, I wish I knew oh, we shouldn't think it's called retirement anyway 12 13. Let's take a call in a minute when you said that well

[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:45.900]
I think you're ready pop a no. I'm close. I really am. I'm close. I'm getting old in. I am too. I'm ready to retire. Just need the money. Yes, sir

[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:49.760]
How you doing today great? Yeah, you know this place has a real quick care

[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:55.240]
If you promoted drinking and partying and smoking dope and eating crappy unhealthy food and all that kind of stuff like the

[01:20:55.240 --> 01:21:00.300]
Rest of society your numbers will probably go up, you know, but the fact that you're healthy now and you're on the right track

[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:03.840]
People don't want to hear that they don't care about that. Well who the hell talks about that

[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:07.040]
I don't consider to talk about my health all day. What does that got to do with my show?

[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:11.800]
If not in other words, they liked me better when I was a big fat slob and I used to sit here shoveling food down my throat

[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.820]
Unfortunately, I think that's the way they all have all the way to I agree with you, sir

[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:19.480]
I agree. Well, we got anything left in here. No nothing. Okay. No, I agree with you, sir

[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.760]
You've that may not be the whole point

[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:26.540]
Look, I want to tell you the world's most depressing man Marvin

[01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:31.620]
Rob bar this man in there is so depressing and he's agree

[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:35.300]
He's not gonna say it's just like when the first person called a few months ago

[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:40.740]
I said well the bird you know the bird added about as much to this. I know you're side tracking your side

[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:46.080]
I'm not gonna come back. We're not talking about the bird. No, I'm not you know, it's like who's the he's just

[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:51.120]
Getting to suck along with this. No, I can take a very funny guy. Everybody attack. I don't care

[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:55.780]
I got it. I'm going to do it. Who's the guy's work with Steve Kane? Who's the guy that played in fatso?

[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.860]
Dom Deloise. Dom Deloise

[01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:05.280]
The more weight he lost the less entertaining he became the healthier he became no question about it

[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.200]
Neal live longer, etc., etc

[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.040]
but

[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:09.720]
Don't you agree?

[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:14.540]
The more weight he look at him. He's going right. Oh my god. No, I'm serious

[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:18.900]
I think it's true too because like the way it is now inside if you don't party you don't drink

[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:22.240]
You don't hang out with people that are unhealthy. I want to associate with you anymore. Exactly

[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:25.720]
And it's a small part of it, but I think all right. All right. How's this?

[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:29.980]
See now that's how they're gonna roll can and Elyberg right in my mouth

[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:35.040]
To the bacon. No, I got to bacon. See now off my now you now you're really gonna get the order

[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.300]
But I stopped doing this because I would hurt it was bad radio

[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:41.120]
Yeah, but no you didn't wait is he halfway to Louisville yet or what?

[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:46.520]
I told I want to I want to repeat this because I said several months ago not just like yesterday

[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:52.060]
But several months ago. I said given enough time boy giri and his evil twin could turn this into a parking lot

[01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:56.180]
Okay, and I wasn't joking when I said it everybody thinks when I attack management

[01:22:56.180 --> 01:23:01.280]
It's a joke, but I was serious and I got news for it. I saw six cranes out in the back

[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:06.840]
Biancing the towers off and working on new yellow lines for more parking spaces for the people of channel seven

[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:10.680]
So you know, don't think it's all a big joke, but this is this is really good though

[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:15.260]
The bottom line is your health your health is more important than any rating. No, Ron's right

[01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:15.960]
It's a little bit wrong

[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:20.340]

[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:43.460]
No, that's not what Marvin's saying Marvin is saying what Marvin knows about radio you could put in his earlobe in that room for the

[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:47.720]
So he dies out there in the control room there the unsung heroes in this business

[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:53.020]
Yeah, there are no ones that put all these pinheads on here. That's right. Marvin takes a big part of the blame for those couple of months

This is almost as exciting as our call from Cynthia Gonzalez

[01:32:53.420 --> 01:33:02.300]
Is as good as the last call about Neil should we go to Amsterdam and should we take any of the drugs with us or do they have plenty over there

Let me taste something is nothing I can do for Stan

[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:12.620]
I think you guys are like a great team. Yeah, the villain Stan. So he doesn't want to continue this conversation

[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:18.120]
You just gave me the high side he said cut this guy off immediately all right come the off no wait a minute

[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:25.640]
The reason I say that is because I I felt there was a little wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute sir hold on a second

[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:29.680]
Okay, you know, it's real interesting how some people conspire

[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:34.460]
But I saw Nick come in here a second ago and set another microphone up at the opposite side of the table

[01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:38.220]
And clear some of the white hots and they re off to the side now

[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:41.320]
I see somebody sliding her ass into the studio

[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:45.900]
Letter to is now going to come and sit down on the show and warm her way in again

[01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:50.040]
Okay, which I find to be one of the most outrageous and grotesque acts of

[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:55.360]
Vulturism in the history of broadcasting okay, I told her that I told her

[01:33:55.360 --> 01:34:00.460]
Believe in he's been saying all morning long back off a little bit Randy. Don't be so push. He don't be a jab

[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:04.020]
And she just can't control herself. I did I told her that

[01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:08.100]
The other day all of those wonderful summer evenings with Jeff Chase have left

[01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:14.900]
The redellable mark on her brain and she just can't run that was eight years ago. Well listen goes to show you what a big memory

[01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:18.620]
She wants to wiggle her way in between you two hunk

[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:24.400]
Yeah, she wants to warm her way into this program and there is no chance. I work alone

[01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:27.760]
Then that'll only she wants to sit in this chair

[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:32.720]
Thank you. Okay, sir nice talking. Okay. What was the purpose of his goal?

[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:33.660]

We're going back to heavy discussions tomorrow. We're going to talk about Orlando Bosch

[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:05.460]
And Juan Bosch and Holi and Javier tomorrow it's going to be heavy-duty. I'm not kidding. I'm more screwing around because it's it's over

[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:06.340]
It's like more downy

[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:11.760]
You know, you have to recognize when something is over when it's run its course and go on to the next thing

[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:20.420]
I don't want to get into anything. Okay. I'm just a guest. Well you said to me. You were going to read it all hang out

[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:23.600]

0.02 and don't worry about it. You're doing great. You're getting better. Don't worry about it.

[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:17.820]
This is one of those suck-a-long comments that the people in the audience say well we're in the verge of going bankrupt

[01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:21.800]
No, you're not you're not gonna go bankrupt look you're driving around in the new vats

[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:24.080]
Yeah, why are you think it's paid for?

[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:28.680]
Well, hey look a lot of things aren't you see that's what happens to everybody in this business sooner or later

[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:32.400]
They start spending money freely and living the high life and that lasts for about five minutes

[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:36.800]
And then all of a sudden they pull the plug and you're like you go to Florida bankruptcy center. It's all over with

[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:43.160]
Yeah, but look Neil there's only three American stations on that am now. So you guys are doing pretty good, okay?

[01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:47.140]
But anyway, what's going on? You do have that is a point. I never thought about that. That's the point

[01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:51.240]
Yeah, think about it. You know, an FM is gonna be swallowed up pretty soon too

[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:55.820]
So you know we haven't got much more to go. What's Bill calls are doing these days? What's he up to?

That was a great one. I was on the road and I didn't have a sure was too bad. We don't have anybody listening to hear it because we come up with some good stuff on a show

[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:39.080]
You're doing it. Don't worry about it. I read the bird. You're gonna be all right. Okay, okay?

[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:40.020]
Good life, but

WYOD

[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:02.680]
I can't believe we haven't heard from champagne. Lume my good buddy. They're probably trying to get him out of his 300 twin turbo

[01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:06.660]
With a shoehorn. Well, don't look at me. I'm just trying to make it till two

[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:10.280]
Oh, you want to go now or in a quarter? I know happy birthday Dion

[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:14.140]
See if things get rough always have something in that machine. See

[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:16.340]
What's that

[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:21.980]
Yeah, we get a lot of calls on this show too. You're he's impressed. You seen all his lines flash

[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:29.540]
Wait till you hear him. You'll be less impressed a mobile on the starline. Yeah, how you doing? Okay, I got a job for that lady. I'll bet

[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:32.180]
Hey listen. Yeah, man. What's going on with the rating?

[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:38.580]
What what is that? What kind of a question is that what's going on with the ratings? They're sinking like a rock

[01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:40.280]
How come

[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:46.620]
You're what what is your answer? Oh, can't instead of asking. I'm out of answers. What is your answer? This is what it

[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:49.360]
Yeah, this is what he

[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:51.120]
Well, that's part of the reason

[01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:59.660]
Let's go to Miami. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Yeah, how you doing? Okay, I go to a school downtown. I'm going to summer school right now

[01:44:00.180 --> 01:44:00.580]
and

[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:06.460]
I'm 15 years old. Wow

[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:07.040]
And

[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.160]
That's that's one big thing. You need the younger audience listening, but I'm sorry

[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:14.760]
Well, what does that mean? That's one big thing

[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:19.700]
Well, if you got the younger audience listening then you have about 80% of Miami

[01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:23.500]
But then again if you talk and Spanish you don't know a young people in Miami

[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:28.500]
Don't you know instead of we had a 90-year of young people we'd have a one because all most of the people here are post-death

[01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:29.640]
Don't you understand that?

[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:33.800]
You don't know what a schmuck I look like in the middle of the material station

[01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:38.560]
Laughing hysterically from your face. You're wrong. I do know what a schmuck you look like. You're absolutely wrong

[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:44.680]
How do you know that? Well, we have one of these phones that will your picture comes up on a screen. Oh really?

[01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:49.340]
Yeah, and I would zip it up if I were you okay? Oh already have a great day pal

[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:53.860]
Good call finally 1247 at W.I.D. What are you shaking your head about?

[01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:59.120]
I heard those calls on QAM with the traveling madden as cousin for half an hour and then call back three times

[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:00.800]
And Gilbert and donut Mike

[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:03.300]
I mean, I realized we can't live up to that standard

[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:07.680]
What happened to this way? What happened to the good days when we used to have those great

[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:11.900]
guest to used to come in on the show like an I and Z huh?

[01:45:13.420 --> 01:45:17.000]
I don't know. I don't have any answers. There's great comments. We're I'm

[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:18.800]
Limb

[01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:22.600]
Well, we know that let's go to Delray. Hello

[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:30.500]
Yeah, okay see see that's what we got one we got a good call of the real thing on eight and now that's like the third one

[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:36.400]
It's got to you people are pathetic. It's not W.I.O.D.s fault. It's the audience. You're about as an original as their fruit fly

[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:42.320]
Okay, they have no original material. They're like Joey Reynolds. Okay. Everything they got is washed over used in the husband

[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:47.380]
I've never met Joey. Oh, thank god. No one of you're in a good mood. Here's a mobile on the starline

[01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:52.220]
Hey, what's up? Neal? How you doing, sir? You know what? I know why you're reading this went down show sucks

[01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:56.800]
No, the show that you're great. You know is these piecehead guests that you have on the show like Bill

[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:00.920]
Like Bill exactly like Bill. You had that shf. Harvey junior last week

[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:05.280]
That that that that alone is gonna bring the ratings down right down the tubes. Yeah, you gotta just

[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:09.620]
How about wait a minute? Let me ask you this do you think some good calls might help him?

[01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:13.540]
Oh the calls usually pretty good. I've had a listen every day faithfully and you know the calls

[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:20.120]
What I said including this one. Yeah, well, no, this one I'm not saying my calls are usually you know, you know

[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:24.400]
Week a little below average maybe week but uh, you know usually the calls are pretty good

[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:27.180]
But I think if you were just hanging there on your own you'll be fine

[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:33.220]
In other words don't have Bill called her on exactly. Oh get lost you jackass. All right

[01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:38.520]
Finally it took almost three hours to get him to show his true colors. He'd love to be on this show

[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:44.560]
You make up you'd love to be sitting here in the chair show them right on your throat and acting like you knew so you'd love it

[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:02.040]
You

[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:06.100]
We got him all we got um, I wonder if that's yeah, that's how a loop a lot of them are like on a loop

[01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:08.740]
So things get slow we just put them on and walk away

[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:18.500]
It's a good one

[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:41.960]
Girl

[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:42.080]
Il

[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:47.120]
Haha

[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:48.000]
Oh

[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:57.140]
I can feel it coming back now we're getting back now folks don't don't lose faith

[01:47:57.140 --> 01:47:59.160]
1250 at W.I.O. Dean will be right

[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:09.060]
Okay, I wanted to hear that so I figured we'd pass if I'm cuz that's our crowd there a bunch of simple things

[01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:14.060]
What do you expect is it possible that most of our audience has already been put away? That's possible

[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:21.660]
Something to think about unlikely. Let's call Arcadia and find out call 53 at good old W.I.O.D. Who's that on the bat line?

[01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:24.200]
Was that like another personal call? I?

[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:25.500]
Hang up on the bat line

[01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:29.080]
Bad son bad son wow

[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:33.480]
Probably clockers Sydney again. Here's a mobile on I 95

[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:35.820]
Yes, sir great

[01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:41.940]
Just a quick suggestion what Randy was over at Q.I.M. She used to have read from thing called a quail report

[01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:46.480]
And there you got some good, you know pretty good political humor there. You may want to try reading from that

[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:48.700]
Ask Randy she has a subscription

[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:53.260]
Yeah, I didn't say that huh oh come on in other words

[01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:58.220]
I'm gonna start getting material from Randy now. Are you putting my legs sir? It was pretty funny. Yeah

[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:03.120]
You know, we know you know the kind of big cup famed, but this year is we don't want to talk about the cup too much

[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:07.720]
What are you talking about where hot as a pistol? We won three in a row man. I know kicking ass

[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:12.900]
Well, we need some pictures back. Well, don't worry about that take it one day at a time

[01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:15.320]
The jury Damon had a good game in his first game in a minor minor

[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:19.760]
Miners and as soon as he comes back, we're gonna trade him so fast. You won't know what hidden between the eyes

[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:22.700]
You know Carl Springs just put on a GN great

[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:28.300]
Outstanding good just in time to see the rest of the cup games with no pressure, right?

[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:34.260]
Okay, all right. We'll see if we can steal out material from Randy. Okay. Okay. Thanks. That'll be the day

[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:37.180]
1254 she has she's become a barracuda

[01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:41.640]
I think you did this to her because from what I understand she was a very unassuming low key type of person

[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:46.520]
That's what Jeff she was fun to work with and a lot of fun over there, but all of a sudden she's become like a

[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.780]
Hungry hungry starving

[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:54.580]
She just kind of hovers over and then she like stands behind this chair like she's real cozy with this chair

[01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:59.040]
Not those chairs over there. No this chair. She wants to be in the driver's seat

[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:03.800]
Sunrise hey Neil hey Bill. Hey, hey. Hey guys doing okay

[01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:08.840]
Man, yeah, I'm in the hospital. Yeah. Yeah, what hospital?

[01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:17.400]
I read and I tell you okay. What do you mean? What is it? What's the year I would tell you?

[01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:23.060]
What what kind of hospital is it that should be reluctant to give the name on the air?

[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:25.480]
I just don't want to have any problems

[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:29.620]
Okay, but let's move on okay, because we're already depressed enough and so far

[01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:32.980]
I have the microphone to my forehead. I'm ready to pull the trigger

[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:36.400]
Yeah, yeah, hey, you've been Neil great

[01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:40.260]
What how much weight did you lose?

[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:42.880]
400 pounds 400 yeah

[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:46.560]
We kicked the champagne luke the show. Yeah

[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:50.320]
So what's the purpose of the color must be something more than this because you come

[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:52.820]
We're kind of like me andry we're not going anywhere with this

[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:59.420]
Okay, have a good luck to you. Okay, Neil bye Bill. Oh, bye. Oh

[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:00.280]
God

[01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:04.560]
1256 I think I need to go in maybe I can get in the joining room with him

[01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:08.280]
Is that that's puts right in there is opening up the bag and

[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:14.720]
I have never met you and there's a rally with that hostile hysterical look at his face like oh Jesus

[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:17.180]
Call they're gonna do afternoons now. We've only been here like no

[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:19.260]
Oh, listen, I couldn't too many stairs

[01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:26.260]
Yeah, that's true. This this place was not the funny part of it is they were building an elevator and as soon as

[01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:32.320]
Rick Riley found out they were building an elevator and they they stopped the construction sit out a minute Rick

[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:36.760]
What is it? Oh, yeah, the ones that have the call letters

[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:43.720]
Cross look at this look at this cute. Yeah, a little black patch. They're supposed to wear the patch around your arm like an arm band

[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:47.760]
Why what are you all depressed about you only being here a couple of months?

[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:53.740]
I'm doing you say his mic is an on Marvin his microphone is it is I don't hear him do you hear him? I hear him

[01:51:53.740 --> 01:52:00.040]
I can't hear him at all well speak up. Hello. Oh, and I'll hear you. Okay. Thank you. I don't think your mic was on

[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:04.920]
You're just covering for Marvin. I know it. Well, he's got a potted way down because he thinks I'm gonna get hysterical

[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:07.580]
Well, he knows you know you're a temperamentian

[01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:09.400]
Right now. Yeah

[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:16.500]
Two six gotta pay attention to your friend. Oh, I called it a four two but this station. We are not hey. It's not

[01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:22.000]
It's not us what I agree. I'm not saying listen. I'm not apology for anything that I do

[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.360]
Because I'm great

[01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:28.460]
You okay you tell me every day god damn right

[01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:33.460]
I mean what the hell else is there in this town? You look at all these stations with these numbers and it's a hot world

[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:38.700]
I would add slimy music. They're playing in all this other crap doing the impression of me you're getting hysterical

[01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:43.440]
No, I'm not I'm just telling you what what what is the alternative? Okay, so you know this is bogus

[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:49.940]
What it's better going flying up to Beltsville, Maryland like the late the cast rule would have done and said let's see those diaries

[01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:52.000]
And what's going on on a thumb through that

[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:58.420]
Disney and boy Gary in the brain trust and those putzes up and they'll be sitting around in a big conference room

[01:52:58.420 --> 01:53:02.200]
gnashing and pairing on with pictures of all of us throwing darts and you're oh yeah

[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:06.940]
He's just painting the ass and this one. He's just allowed mouth and this one. He's doing too much of that eating on it

[01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:10.420]
I'm telling you the rest of all being here. That's the way they operate here

[01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:16.200]
Bill's gonna a lot of rest being a guest on the show. I had to try this. This is you don't you get the same numbers have gone down

[01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:22.700]
You don't see Phil cost him coming in here much anymore. Do you like he used to sucking around he knows he knows when somebody's on the way out

[01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:25.780]
Things are gonna get better. What does that mean?

[01:53:26.340 --> 01:53:29.120]
Why you think they're gonna leave us alone long enough for things to get better?

[01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:36.380]
Get the tea bigger. I think what we need is a lot more changes. Yeah, I think what we need is a panic attack at W.I.

[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:39.820]
Now you got a sofa leather sofa and a

[01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:42.540]
Well, I sold it just before I came into that chair

[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:44.540]
I gave it back

[01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:48.240]
No, 14. What is this the trading post you?

[01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:49.400]
You know

[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:53.240]
Just a minute you want to get on our show. I'd love to talk

[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:56.860]
Well talk about the sofa on your show camp trying to stay at least over a three

[01:53:57.700 --> 01:54:01.500]
When you were talking the other day about the trading post and how it doesn't work on this stage

[01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:07.340]
Yeah, I almost called you because many times Stan and I went to have Stan. I would me when I'm really desperate

[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:14.800]
We have commiserated about the fact. This is the this audience doesn't respond like any other audience in this market

[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:20.820]
I'm not talking about other markets. This is a strange audience the IOD on it. Yeah, I like the trading post

[01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:25.220]
Anyway, we've got Chuck Meyer standing by with a one o'clock WIOD news

[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:28.840]
We got a good sofa for you by the way of knockout incredible for like a chair

[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:34.420]
I got a chair for you. Yeah, and we got a chair for Randy too. Okay, we're a little surprised in a when she sits down

[01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:39.460]
Anyway, Chuck's got our one o'clock news our mammoth one to two hour comes back and when we come back after the news

[01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:43.840]
The ratings are gonna be up as a matter of fact. I think we made a mistake. I think we read them backward

[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:48.280]
I think that 4.0 was like a zero point something

[01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:58.100]
I'm talking both y'all and this is the one to two all

[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:07.640]
There isn't a day that goes by what he speaks with me on a phone every day that he doesn't rip you guys for at least a half an hour

[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:12.440]
Anyway, it's 106 and WIOD it likes you personally just thinks you're show sucks

[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:17.660]
We have an open line in Broward 524 bill and the star corder line is also

[01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:22.140]
Now why don't you admit it? Okay. This is a we agreed to turn over a new leaf

[01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:23.860]
This year a new leaf

[01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:29.160]
And let's be honest you think that they're doing my act and they should do their own thing

[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:34.580]
Whatever no, I said this on the air. I do not think they're doing your act. What do you think they're doing now?

[01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:39.320]
Come on jump ahead. Okay back at you

[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:46.480]
They're not doing your act and I you keep saying that all these people are doing your life what you said

[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:52.560]
Not on the air this would see what you say on the year and off the year are two different. Well of course. Oh

[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:55.780]
Yeah, that's something to think about maybe that's my problem

[01:55:56.300 --> 01:56:03.100]
Okay, we got two old news talking Broward 524 WIOD what loves you guys I do

[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:08.640]
I do and that's why I'm so disappointed in heaven. I've been arguing with you about that for three months now

[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:12.540]
I said these guys are gonna kick ass then the book comes out and it goes in the

[01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:16.580]
way that he's still blaming Alex Bennett. Yeah, well and when

[01:56:16.580 --> 01:56:20.660]
October comes and we're all three of us out at the Camilla's house standing online

[01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:23.040]
as an as an as a

[01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:27.000]
Disinterested as an outside of the room. Yes outside person

[01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:31.500]
I don't agree with him that it's all

[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:38.600]
Alex Bennett you can't go through life blaming Alex Bennett for everything sounds like a good idea though. It's for fees to

[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:41.820]
Orlando boss you can't do it

[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:50.640]
Yeah Orlando Bosch blamed Alex he did I heard the speech everybody blames Alex city is a comedy every if I had the ability

[01:56:50.660 --> 01:56:53.620]
To I take you out here right now kick your goddamn teeth in

[01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:55.780]
Secondly

[01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:58.940]
Yeah, the only comment I would make and I

[01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:02.060]
Probably will offend some people by saying please

[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:06.900]
So okay, yeah, okay. You advertise yourself as a news talk station

[01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:11.740]
And then everybody spends all this time talking about so and so well

[01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:18.100]
They're not a talk show host or this person's not a talk show host who this person's not a talk show host

[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:24.960]
And I think that's in Congress and in other words if you're not if you're not gonna if you're not going to

[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:31.120]
Have people who are talk show host. Yeah, then don't call yourself a talk show

[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:33.120]
I just call ourselves the entertainment station

[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:37.200]
Well, you know when we were the great hour that when we were the great entertainers

[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:42.160]
We hung it on that and everybody had a good time and that was that was our you had Larry King on a station

[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:47.620]
He wasn't a great entertainer. He wasn't even a mediocre entertainer. He's just a freeloading cheap skate

[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:50.360]
That's another story. Oh

[01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:51.660]
Okay

[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:55.840]
No, you know what I'm saying it doesn't it's like

[01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:01.600]
And you had one or two others on that station who worked great entertainers too, but I don't want to drag you into that

[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:07.780]
Discussion no, no, but the point is I understand you had a thing there was a an umbrella right and

[01:58:08.740 --> 01:58:13.500]
And everybody was under that umbrella we were the first people in town to do crossovers

[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:20.540]
We did crossovers like crazy everybody thought everybody loved each other. I never I never got along with Rene

[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:27.400]
I never thought big Wilson was the greatest talent that ever came down the pike

[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:34.860]
I never thought Larry King was Mr. Wonderful. In other words, you were the great entertainer. I was the great entertainer

[01:58:39.100 --> 01:58:39.980]
Exactly now

[01:58:39.980 --> 01:58:44.720]
We finally took me almost three and a half hours to get that out of them, but now we've got the truth out

[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:48.480]
That's what I always said. Did you ever I want to ask for a dish?

[01:58:49.140 --> 01:58:55.180]
Did you ever stop a thing about what might have happened at a radio station for getting this one?

[01:58:58.600 --> 01:58:59.080]
If

[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:03.340]
If you hadn't left

[01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:07.620]
Yeah, like say think about that. Yeah, I think about that

[01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:15.000]
I think about it with QAM like would they have gone oldies if I'd still been there? I don't think so

[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:20.340]
In other words one person can make a difference. Can you see Zeta? I do mornings

[01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:25.540]
Rick and Puts do midday you do afternoon and stand as night on Zeta

[01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:30.600]
Unbeatable talking entertainment and fun little bit of music. I'm pretty unbeatable. We have a great station

[01:59:31.220 --> 01:59:34.300]
And I don't want you know, I don't want to start getting across singover

[01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:35.180]
Yeah, across

[01:59:35.180 --> 01:59:41.920]
See that's the problem with this station and we do a little bit now, but with Alex you couldn't cross over because it would be a fist fight

[01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:43.800]
So that was impossible

[01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:49.260]
And I notice Hank see Hank is the one sports guy. I mean, I love sunny sunny is a great guy

[01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:53.600]
But on when he's doing like sports talk it's like cut off from the end of the station

[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:55.720]
Certainly when Joe is doing it's cut off from the rest of the world

[01:59:56.280 --> 02:00:01.020]
But but Hank like I noticed the other night he was joking about the management keeps saying we don't want to hear these

[02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:03.780]
Nealisms about in the area and he's making the joke out of it a stick

[02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:08.600]
And there's like cross over with you about do you hear the guy with a Corvette the other night and he said or with the

[02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:17.080]
Said in nine love the audience woman car the audience likes it and also makes the station like a family exactly like a family

[02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:22.340]
Like it's all related instead of these isolated the separated choppy you know like well

[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:26.020]
We got the dolphins over here and we never the twain shall meet

[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:32.320]
And they haven't had that here since the great entertainers true, but it's only been a couple of months

[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:36.380]
What give a time to catch that well look that's my point. I don't disagree with that

[02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:39.960]
But you know as well as I do right now they're in a cold sweat

[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:43.000]
They're sitting in their swig and see Grums is seven right now like it like

[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:45.780]
So to pop keeping busy. I'm serious

[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:48.960]
So we get this thing back on an Atlanta man. They're doing the two apple quick step

[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:53.560]
There's like a line 40 yards long to the john up in Atlanta Cox enterprise. Are you crazy?

[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:56.700]
And they're all saying well cheese for paint rogers all that big money

[02:00:56.700 --> 02:00:59.740]
He's got a stick in four share and with these guy naft know we're gonna be the great thing

[02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:04.740]
You know the way management people in this business think in the way they overreact

[02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:08.800]
I was told if we have any more changes here we might as well get the

[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:12.900]
Shovels out and start digging for the parking lot. I was told when we started here

[02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:15.520]
They're not looking for anything from us for a couple of bucks

[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:21.820]
They realized the damage that was done. Oh, and they're gonna wait. They told me that they said that they did they

[02:01:22.380 --> 02:01:26.540]
I think you said it the Atlanta. She's not here anymore. Boy Gary. Boy Gary said that

[02:01:27.540 --> 02:01:27.940]
Oh

[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:29.400]
You bet

[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:34.400]
I wait now. Are you saying that boy Gary admitted that he's a lung head and not in those words?

[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:38.760]
No seriously, but that he actually understands that he screwed this radio station up badly

[02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:43.740]
He realizes that I was still suffering the fall. I'm not gonna sit here and apologize for what I do

[02:01:43.740 --> 02:01:47.820]
And sure we got some moron callers on there, but this is a fun show. He's gonna enjoy it

[02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:51.140]
I'm not gonna come on Monday and start talking about hemorrhoids again

[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:53.600]
Tuesday maybe

[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:56.240]
You know what I think diversified a little bit

[02:01:56.780 --> 02:02:03.020]
Is because you are so popular that a lot of people on other stations are stealing your act. So it's not

[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.580]
Unique totally because they borrowed a lot of your stuff

[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:12.980]
People on other stations. Yeah, well not on this one. No. Okay. No. I mean

[02:02:12.980 --> 02:02:15.220]
I just want to

[02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:22.640]
Talk about defensive and paranoid. I think he'll pay me a great compliment when I was looking on the way in

[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:27.000]
I know he didn't mean it, but I want to point it out and maybe maybe he was being to see he was

[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:32.740]
He said you guys are a better man. Let him say what I said. He said he was listening. He tunes around

[02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:37.420]
He said radio doesn't sound fun anymore. He said outside of Rick and suds

[02:02:37.420 --> 02:02:41.280]
He said it doesn't sound like people are having fun. Whether you like the show or not we are having fun

[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:47.500]
We're having a shot and you're too stupid to understand. Well, maybe so a dig maybe so it's like a sarcastic dig

[02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:49.080]
Really good then this

[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:52.760]
What are I but you would be finished wait a minute. I don't need an interpreter here

[02:02:53.800 --> 02:03:01.220]
I think you do you're in Miami. I felt good about that. I'm not paying any more bill. This is Miami because we do have a good time our stage

[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:06.800]
What I have a good time too. I know you do who the hell am I like chop liver now?

[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.260]
Oh you're gonna have a compliment please don't be cool

[02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:14.500]
He would never compliment me because he knows that I've got a mammoth ego and I make a lot of money and he isn't gonna do that

[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:17.880]
Until he needs to ride to the track. I just said I appreciate I

[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:23.380]
I found a phone Friday at a photo. Say you know you're sure yesterday was pretty interesting there a couple or he won't say

[02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:27.300]
I was good, but he'll say there were a couple of pretty interesting callers because when it gets toward the weekend

[02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:30.260]
He starts sucking around because you know Sunday we're going to the track again

[02:03:31.180 --> 02:03:38.540]
I've known him 15 years we worked together at a 27 radio stations this month this year and to this

[02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:41.900]
Moment that's now what he's gonna say is a lie

[02:03:41.900 --> 02:03:47.520]
I know what you're gonna say. I've never complimented you. That's a lie. No, it's okay

[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:51.220]
I have gone on about him about the show on I and Z at night

[02:03:51.220 --> 02:03:57.120]
I've gone on here about I got screwed over on the station. Yeah, but that's not the one you didn't let me finish

[02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:01.940]
To say you hung around with him for 10 minutes. You're not the show does he play music?

[02:04:03.380 --> 02:04:08.600]
He plays well, I should have asked her. I thought I'd what does he do? He in other words, he doesn't do a talk show

[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:10.440]
He never did a talk show

[02:04:10.900 --> 02:04:14.080]
Oh these bozos here man. They brought this guy and all he does is that

[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:15.800]
Reduces come and see if we right with you

[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:20.840]
Wait a minute. Are you busy? Yeah, I really have to answer another call. Okay. Hold on. Okay

[02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:26.780]
You're nobody kill somebody. I better get the right car to the machine. Uh-huh

[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:29.280]
Somebody loves you

[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:31.480]
Oh nobody

[02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:33.300]
Is somebody

[02:04:35.220 --> 02:04:36.600]
Get in the right room

[02:04:37.180 --> 02:04:37.580]
Nobody

[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:40.000]
Is somebody

[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:44.980]
If I had the ability to do I take you out here right now. I'm kicking god damn teeth in

[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:48.000]
Yeah, yes

[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:49.860]
Lori, how you doing?

[02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:58.740]
Yeah, cut that back a little bit back there. We want to hear Lori. We don't want to hear all that raucous rock

[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:02.620]
Right right Lori? Yeah, we don't want to hear all that noise

[02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:05.280]
We call we call to speak to you

[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:07.380]
Okay, so what's going on Lori?

[02:05:08.260 --> 02:05:12.460]
Yeah, we're on the year on W.I.O.D. and Miami Alex's favorite station

[02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:16.160]
I see I see and there's this big article that somebody brought in from

[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:22.140]
The Marin independent journal, which I guess is one of your really big papers. Yeah, not really

[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:26.220]
Yeah, Alex is just and he was on TV. I guess on Friday

[02:05:26.980 --> 02:05:32.260]
Or last Friday. I don't know. He's just all over the place. It's amazing and since he's such a he loved Miami so much

[02:05:32.260 --> 02:05:36.520]
In such a big fan of the station and me in particular. I thought we'd call him check in with him

[02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:39.120]
Well, actually Alex can't talk enough because he's on the air

[02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:40.840]
Well, I'm on a year too

[02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:48.800]
Well, are you like blowing the off-ways at what you're doing?

[02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:53.940]
Well, wait a minute. Did you tell him that I was on the phone? He knows

[02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:56.920]
He knows them on the phone and that's why he won't come to the phone

[02:05:56.920 --> 02:06:00.740]
He doesn't do smaller markets

[02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:05.660]
Well, I have his resume here and it seems to me that he once worked in Reno, Nevada

[02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:08.940]
In San Rafael

[02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:16.420]
Yeah, well, wait a minute. In other words, you're ending the conversation. Yeah, because I had it

[02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:20.820]
So I can't ask you like what kind of a show he does out there. He plays a lot of music or

[02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:28.440]
But you don't really take phone calls on the air. I say you don't take any calls on the air

[02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:31.080]
But you just don't get many right?

[02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:37.620]
Right, well, like who's on today

[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:43.120]
I mean like Roger Craig from the Giants

[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:46.220]
Uh-huh. Well, that's pretty exciting

[02:06:46.780 --> 02:06:47.920]
Well, they're doing it

[02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:51.780]
Yeah, they're moving up a little bit and you had who you had Cisco and the eBird?

[02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:54.840]
Boy, for you guys to monkey around

[02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:59.080]
Well, tell them we're gonna work real hard so one day we can work in a big market like that too, okay?

[02:06:59.620 --> 02:07:02.680]
Give him a big kiss on that forehead and tell him happy 50th birthday

[02:07:03.860 --> 02:07:04.920]
Okay, by Laurie

[02:07:05.880 --> 02:07:07.400]
What a piece of crap

[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:12.260]
20 afternoon at WID you know, it's run the whole you didn't talk to smaller markets

[02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:15.000]
There are news for it the biggest market you were in in your life was public

[02:07:15.620 --> 02:07:17.340]
Anyway, we have an open line in

[02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:22.680]
Hey kids if you thought Peewee was fun tune in this Saturday morning for

[02:07:30.620 --> 02:07:31.580]
He's playhouse

Boys and girls welcome to

[02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:38.500]
On his playhouse today's world is oozy watch

[02:07:39.780 --> 02:07:41.520]
Wasn't that fun

[02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:45.820]
Meet some of our knees friends like Terry the Teradacto

[02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:48.300]
by Terry

[02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:50.540]

[02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:56.800]
Consider yourself extinct wasn't that fun the fun never stops at aren't he's playhouse now

Your next movie is gonna stink oh really okay kids let's sing hi head hi head

[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:16.340]
It's time to eat some lead

[02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:23.180]
Don't miss the Saturday morning madness on aren't he's playhouse don't go away

[02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:24.940]
We'll be fast

[02:08:26.420 --> 02:08:32.920]
I can't believe it. I just I'm rubbing off is it in the air it's not a kind of talk about the fact that he was the one

[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:37.040]
But Henry was in here before I off the year. I said he was the one

[02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:42.400]
It was funny and a man in the street not Larry King Larry King has never said a funny line in his life other than low

[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:43.780]
Me 50 million dollars

[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:50.400]
I said that many times and I just got through saying a moment ago you were the great entertainer big Wilson was a nice guy

[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:54.540]
Well, I let him into what I said him up for it. Yeah big was a nice guy

[02:08:54.540 --> 02:08:59.000]
But he was about as exciting as yesterday's chocolate milk. He wasn't a great entertain. He was

[02:08:59.580 --> 02:09:04.340]
boring hello big hello. I mean I granted. He's dead. He was he was a nice guy who's one of the nicest people

[02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:08.240]
I've ever known I knew him pretty well now you're missing the keyword and that that staff though

[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:11.320]
I agree with everything you say about everybody that was out of the

[02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:13.420]
The keyword was

[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:17.500]
Balance everybody was

[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:21.020]
Yeah, well the second show

[02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:26.080]
No, if there was an umbrella and everybody was different under the umbrella exactly

[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:31.100]
But like I said the other day yesterday when I went through one of my many tantrums that I've done this week

[02:09:31.100 --> 02:09:35.320]
And I think that this bears out that I'm doing it at the right time. I've been here almost two years now

[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:36.740]
There has never been one meeting

[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:42.280]
Okay, I'm not talking about where Alan Anderson will call you in and play your tape and critique you in front of everybody and rip your ass

[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:43.020]
That's not a meeting

[02:09:43.020 --> 02:09:45.480]
But I mean just to sit down and just to

[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:49.980]
Shoot the breeze and exchange ideas and and like develop a report

[02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:53.980]
Renieri comes in here man 10 o'clock in the morning. He's out the door like a weasel

[02:09:53.980 --> 02:09:56.600]
I mean, I like Michael I he's a good guy. He and I get along fine

[02:09:56.600 --> 02:10:00.640]
But he's out the door man and he like there is no crossover whatsoever

[02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:03.760]
I mean even this week like with Sonny I'll be sitting in here all of a sudden

[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:08.940]
I realize he's talking to me on the air and we're doing a little stick back at fourth why not we always use to do that

[02:10:08.940 --> 02:10:10.580]
I and Z we do it here

[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:15.200]
Why not the audience likes that it develops that kind of thing you're talking about here

[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:20.340]
It's like us against them even Steve and I used to do it and some of the audience hated it

[02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:22.960]
But was something to talk about oh don't let Steve come in there anymore

[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:26.500]
But it was still they got into it see is you gonna come in tomorrow?

[02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:32.020]
You're gonna let him in on the show, but here it's like man. It's like never the twain show meets like more

[02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:35.080]
The how are we talking? I don't know

[02:10:35.980 --> 02:10:39.440]
Be ready. Hey killed about 15 minutes. Oh, but it's true. There's no

[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:45.880]
Image but it's coming back. It is coming back. You can destroy you can destroy a whole life

[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:51.980]
You're missing it. You know, you know, you're the same guy that came in here during the news break and told me that story about how you were on the air for like four minutes

[02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:57.160]
Some station and they canned your ass and then they brought you back and they gave you enough time and you built like a five-year

[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:01.220]
No, if you wanted to tell the story I said I said the beginning of the year here

[02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:02.820]
somebody will recall I said

[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:09.060]
Between the bird being gone and all this other insanity that's gone on I said I'm really starting over again

[02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:12.520]
And I knew that I didn't realize it would get this bad for the whole station

[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:18.980]
But I feel like I'm starting all over again. I said that several times well it's a challenge because now we have to start building a whole new audience

[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:26.020]
What I said and the audience should understand this because you talk about arbitrarian a lot is there's an arbitrarian lag

[02:11:26.020 --> 02:11:32.240]
We are so secondary in their lives what they wrote down and what we're reading now is what happened four to six musk

[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:36.520]
A lot of habit you know that they don't keep a log they don't sit there and if they drive them away

[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:40.860]
How are they going to be around to notice that there's a change well be through those great billboards?

[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:43.560]
Well, that's throughout about I have forgotten about that

[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:49.340]
What I had said was teeth and town when we had started at this other station we started two weeks after a book

[02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:53.140]
We gave it we went out from a two three to a two four and they canned us

[02:11:53.140 --> 02:11:58.560]
They brought us back let us finish out another book and at two four one two a five one the next book

[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:03.520]
You gotta let it settle in they just were so secondary they could care less and when it comes to

[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:07.380]
Dictating our lives with what they fill out. They don't care. It just means nothing

[02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:15.460]
Anybody in this market really believes that people under the age of 65 are tuning in big numbers to I and Z

[02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:19.820]
They're crazy. They're nuts. It's not happening. It's not gonna happen

[02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:24.160]
Can I make one I and Z is so boring that even my dogs going to a coma. Yes sir

[02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:32.520]
To me the ideal situation is a winning a lot of it that I go back

[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:37.720]
To a guy named hot grams who was a general manager

[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:44.980]
You're gonna let me finish anything today or you want me to just get up and leave I know you can't do that. What was the name?

[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:47.180]
Let me finish hog

[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:54.020]
Hod in right he was a general manager of KSD in St. Louis and they hired me

[02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:58.580]
Away from another station now listen to the camo x

[02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:03.160]
Right the first book came out

[02:13:03.940 --> 02:13:08.260]
And I went into his office and I said how did I do how did I do how did I do

[02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:12.060]
He got up. He shut the door to his office

[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:15.300]
He poured me some scotch

[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:24.680]
And he said let's have an understanding. Yeah, he said we hired you because we like what you do

[02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:31.360]
Let us worry about the numbers you do what you do the best

[02:13:32.140 --> 02:13:35.040]
If you get off track, we'll let you know about it

[02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:41.080]
But don't worry about that book. We don't live or die by that book

[02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:43.380]
Can you get that guy back now when did you get camp?

[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:48.120]
No, it didn't get. Oh, okay, but I mean the point is in a way

[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:54.120]
I think he made a little sense because it's gotten to the point now where everybody is so

[02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:56.520]
Freaky about the book

[02:13:58.140 --> 02:14:04.160]
Freaky well, I'll give you a good example. We talk about the pluses and the mind is gonna talk about ratings on a station again

[02:14:04.620 --> 02:14:10.460]
Ever tell it. I'm not no. No, I see that would be no ever period. I'm ending it today

[02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:18.820]
Why because I just because I think what he says is true like dick per I give you an example dick perton indy trot

[02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:22.540]
I think it's one of the greatest talents and you would go along with that in the country's a funny guy

[02:14:22.540 --> 02:14:23.860]
He's been in Detroit for years

[02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:28.780]
He is had I mean his numbers are fairly good not phenomenal but good

[02:14:28.780 --> 02:14:34.160]
Uh JP McCarthy beats him all the time JP's about as exciting as this cup. Okay. I mean he's got a great voice

[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:36.280]
He's boring, but he's on wjr

[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:38.240]
He's been there forever in the morning on the same station

[02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:42.080]
He gets enormous numbers and perton can't beat him. Okay. He gets good numbers

[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:48.060]
But not phenomenal and yet he makes enormous amounts of money. They sell out his show and and I happy

[02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:53.580]
And I think what you're saying. I think what you're saying is if you know you can become so obsessed with this that it becomes like a neurosis

[02:14:53.580 --> 02:14:59.360]
Exactly, and I think that's what it's become yeah, I'm somebody called me at home last night and said

[02:14:59.980 --> 02:15:03.240]
Get me those numbers get me those numbers

[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:09.320]
And after I met my father could it no calm not at all and

[02:15:09.980 --> 02:15:14.900]
I thought about it afterwards. I thought my god. Is that what we've come to in this business?

[02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:20.900]
Numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers and when I went to work at Q.A.M. the other side of the coin

[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:25.000]
That he said I know you're not going to believe this

[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:30.400]
But if you break a one we don't have anything in there. He said you're not going to get any calls

[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:32.560]
You're not going to get anything and I said oh

[02:15:33.300 --> 02:15:38.580]
He says I'm serious. You're not going to get anything nobody's going to call nobody's going to do anything

[02:15:38.980 --> 02:15:42.860]
Because there's nobody listening if you ever break a one

[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:48.900]
He said we'll send a limousine for you. Well, he sent you a certified letter. Well same difference

[02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:52.660]
You know, I need to after when I got into a brain. I got everything is relative. It's our okay

[02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:59.360]
We still I was alone the air. I'm gonna do it. Well, when we come back after the break can we put a semi-cold in there?

[02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:01.580]
How's your colon?

[02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:07.300]
Anyway, if you're tired of paying high prices for CDs bill and I're going up to the CD exchange one of these days very soon

[02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:12.200]
Because both of us got loads of CDs every week Rick Riley goes there all the time

[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:16.700]
That's why I've got some Luis bonfire and a good part of the deal is there all the CDs are only

[02:16:16.700 --> 02:16:24.040]
75 at all times they have thousands of CDs and stock everything from jazz to classical rock to rap country to Christmas

[02:16:24.040 --> 02:16:29.300]
Even M.O.R. like on the Bob Gordon show and if you have loads and loads of those piggy-least sitting around

[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:35.340]
He'd like to bring him in and swap them the best part is they give you a five dollar credit when you trade a CD in that way a different CD

[02:16:35.340 --> 02:16:38.980]
Cost only two dollars and 95 cents an incredible deal

[02:16:38.980 --> 02:16:44.420]
So instead of spending all my harder and money for CDs. We're gonna go up there and check it all out. Okay?

[02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:47.620]
Incredible CD exchange there open every day 10 a.m. to 10 p.m

[02:16:47.620 --> 02:16:51.900]

[02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:57.540]
Just out the open park boulevard all 441 next to radio shack in the extra shopping center

[02:16:57.540 --> 02:17:01.140]
You tell them bill callers sent you by to the CD exchange

[02:17:03.820 --> 02:17:08.780]
Hi, this is Stan Bajor. Hope you enjoyed our recent program regarding the Kennedy assassination

Should we take some calls? Did you want to just ramble on it? We got a full board of calls. Let's take them

[02:17:59.820 --> 02:18:04.600]
Let's take them. Okay, oh, there's a lot of talent. Here's the first one. We ever dropped the bomb. I ain't a minute

[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:10.500]
Yeah, speaking of red necks. Where were you talking about a Carson Rennie earlier? How did you get on here?

[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:17.980]
I'm in here. Oh, you were doing the thing. I was doing it. Well, how can we stop? I just had to oh

[02:18:17.980 --> 02:18:19.820]
Before we say about that red neck

[02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:26.060]
About what Carson Carson Rennie the greatest broadcaster who ever lived I'll ever see read

[02:18:27.420 --> 02:18:27.820]
What?

[02:18:29.060 --> 02:18:34.280]
What about it? What the hell are you talking about? I can't believe it. Look at that. We have a celebrity

[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:38.960]
intern back in there Ross's back and to visit where the scene of the crime was

[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:43.540]
Hey, I saw your boys up in Atlanta last week. Okay. Hold on a second. So you're about as exciting as

[02:18:43.540 --> 02:18:46.060]
A curtlene that's the guy who was doing a cackel and he's

[02:18:46.060 --> 02:18:51.240]
Got into a different year. How did he get in the anise and Rennie? Yeah, uh, Neil. Yes, sir

[02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:54.840]
I kind of agree with you about it. Welcome to the last Neil Rogers show sir

[02:18:54.840 --> 02:18:59.880]
Well, well, then let's make it a memorable call first. I think Rick is there to

[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:05.040]
Spongebob of you like a little stuck. There is no question about it and he'd be the first one to admit it

[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:10.940]
Yeah, and so in review and I pretty upset when all the food was gone too. I'll tell you that yeah, but net bull now

[02:19:10.940 --> 02:19:15.400]
They're not enough listeners to suck off of which is what now he's got a real problem there

[02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:18.620]
They're too many why are you attacking my good friends in the afternoon?

[02:19:18.620 --> 02:19:20.560]
See this is part of the iod audience

[02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:26.040]
This is part of what's sharing our kids and out he does not do the same show that I do sir

[02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:31.160]
I do a good show. Oh, excuse me. Well, you do a good show, but you know, it's that same youth or kind of fun

[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:36.180]
Fun. What's wrong with that? What do you want this to be the dead station? We've already got WS new leather

[02:19:36.180 --> 02:19:40.100]
We've already got life in WS new. You've got two dead states. So let them talk

[02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:44.360]
No one more than death finish. Please program the show this afternoon. Are you screaming out of the microphone?

[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:49.900]
No, I think you've got them upset sir program the show this afternoon. Go ahead. Okay. Now. Yeah. Okay. Let's do it.

[02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:51.760]
Let's do it. Minify a minute. What do you want him to do when he come on?

[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:56.900]
What do you want him to say? I'll write it down. Come on. It's easy to criticize. Let's come up with something positive

[02:19:56.900 --> 02:20:03.000]
Too many people call your show Neil to go. I'm dying over here another idiot at Gilbert. He could I thought we were talking about

[02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:04.940]
Out of here for taking this show. Okay?

[02:20:05.580 --> 02:20:12.280]
Then another guy calls up because sometimes they feel then you get that old lady she goes hello, Neil

[02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:13.880]
Then there's a kid he goes

[02:20:14.740 --> 02:20:20.720]
Who wants to hear that? Mr. Radio calls one guy goes butt load back at you

[02:20:21.720 --> 02:20:22.200]
Day

[02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:27.340]
129 at W.I.O.D.

[02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:33.140]
Your friendly station for you were getting psychotic there for just I thought we were gonna lose you. I am right

[02:20:33.140 --> 02:20:36.080]
I don't hear myself did something happen from the buzzer

[02:20:37.300 --> 02:20:42.280]
Miami hello, how you doing? Welcome to the Bill Calder show with a Randy Martin on 610 W.I.O.D.

[02:20:42.660 --> 02:20:49.360]
Yes, Bill Calder. I've always heard Neil mention you but I've never heard your program with while I don't have a program sir

[02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:53.480]
When you did I never really did have a program

[02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:57.060]
Why did he go and why did he get up and run out of here like a petal and child?

[02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:01.360]
Okay, go ahead sir. They don't believe you. No, but I think you're pounding

[02:21:02.180 --> 02:21:04.360]
Let this caller speak I think he has something

[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:07.860]
You wanted to speak because he's gonna suck around with you. No, I don't think so

[02:21:09.860 --> 02:21:15.720]
You sure were a lot of fun today and I don't think he a no, I think he wants to say a state of hell off the show

[02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:20.240]
No, I don't matter fact. I think you're enlightening the program just a little

[02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:24.640]
Exactly you're adding something to it. We haven't had for a long time. No, I'm not saying no

[02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:28.960]
I told Neil during one of the breaks one of the many breaks

[02:21:29.980 --> 02:21:35.140]
That I felt I should have come on Monday as originally schedule. No, this is a much better

[02:21:35.900 --> 02:21:40.840]
I don't know. I just don't I'm not comfortable here having a radio minion would not have been up there

[02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:44.880]
Well, I feel uncomfortable because I feel a certain

[02:21:46.840 --> 02:21:50.180]
Sometimes I feel well, you know sometimes I feel that

[02:21:50.780 --> 02:21:56.240]
Well, I think I think you two are very entertaining. We are and I think it's very exciting

[02:21:56.240 --> 02:22:03.580]
You ought to ride down the work with us. I think you should continue. I've been there. I he should be on a show every day, right?

[02:22:03.940 --> 02:22:08.840]
I listen to you I do it for the free lunch. I listen to IOD I would not listen to any other AM

[02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:12.020]
stations because I think IOD is very entertaining

[02:22:12.020 --> 02:22:17.520]
Not informative that I think is a difference between I and Z and IOD

[02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:24.340]
We're not informative not why could we don't have some fat broads sitting here reading the same news 400 times in a row is that it?

[02:22:24.340 --> 02:22:26.020]
No, no, no, I'm talking about

[02:22:26.020 --> 02:22:27.180]
I'm just kidding

[02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:32.600]
When I work at you know, I've talked to you before I work at the VA when I'm working there

[02:22:33.140 --> 02:22:37.260]
I don't want to hear Yankees and I used to be a big-time Yankee fan. What the hell does?

[02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:42.360]
Nobody wants you're the Yankee. So what I do is listen I and Z at night and it's informative

[02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:49.260]
Okay, that's the difference. I don't think you compare W IOD with I and Z anybody else because IOD is in a class of its own

[02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:53.240]
That's correct. It will always be now. I was gonna ask you Neil

[02:22:54.780 --> 02:23:02.160]
Back which I didn't listen to your show back then but I heard about it through the media when you had a controversy with the condo commandos

[02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:04.200]
Did your ratings go up?

[02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:05.780]
Of course way up

[02:23:05.780 --> 02:23:09.500]
Well doesn't that tell you something maybe it's time for another one?

[02:23:09.500 --> 02:23:12.720]
No, I don't do contrived controversy sir that just happened

[02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:14.820]
But I get accused of that all the time

[02:23:14.820 --> 02:23:19.480]
I just do whatever is on my mind and whatever is timely right and I don't sit as you

[02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:22.800]
What am I going to do to start your time to start ratings? I don't do that

[02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:28.120]
Your timing's perfect, but if you notice earlier you mentioned when you went to this radio station

[02:23:28.120 --> 02:23:31.000]
The ratings went up and then they went down. Yeah

[02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:36.900]
Well, sure that went down because we got into a whole thing with the FCC and they took off about 80% of our material and

[02:23:37.680 --> 02:23:43.340]
And and that that segment of that audience that wanted to hear somebody say penis on here. They're all gone

[02:23:43.980 --> 02:23:49.000]
Okay, they're gone and what we're doing is rebuilding now and the people who wanted to hear Steve with his contrived

[02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:51.200]
Afternoon they're all gone

[02:23:52.140 --> 02:23:57.480]
Okay, basically there are two big at listen to me. There are two major elements of this radio station that have disappeared

[02:23:57.480 --> 02:24:03.060]
So you have to go out and start building again from ground level. I mean we're still it's not like we got a one share

[02:24:03.060 --> 02:24:08.800]
We still got a four okay. That's not chopped liver. It's still the highest rated top show in the market and between 10 and two

[02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:13.320]
It's about a four six or a four seven. Okay. That's not a bad number. It's a very good number

[02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:18.220]
But the bottom line is the only way this is one of the most transient and changing markets in the country

[02:24:18.220 --> 02:24:24.760]
You have to go out there and promote you can't sit back and rest on your laurels because we have thousands of new people moving into this town

[02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:29.780]
Every day and thousands of people moving out and the promotion you can't complain about the promotion on this station

[02:24:29.780 --> 02:24:36.300]
We don't have any other than billboards with false teeth. We don't have any promotion. I don't think the rating systems is true to life

[02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:40.900]
I don't think it has any kind of value at all the paparading system. They have right. I think it's great

[02:24:41.660 --> 02:24:45.080]
I just think yeah, I think yeah, I did that just to stop you in your track

[02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:49.380]
I don't want to sit here and belly ache about other rating system is bad because all the time

[02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:51.480]
I had good books which is most of the time been the market

[02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:52.480]
I never said well

[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:54.740]
We got an 11 share, but the rating system sucks

[02:24:55.240 --> 02:25:00.520]
That's like a pride baby. I just that's like something Greg Buidel would do. I must get her Alex Bennett

[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:06.780]
I'll be a lot of credit for the type of program and the type of formats they have now because I have to let me know

[02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:12.060]
Well, see now is a now it'll be an interesting time in the history of this radio station to see whether they will

[02:25:12.060 --> 02:25:15.860]
Have the courage of their convictions whether they make a couple of minor adjustments

[02:25:15.860 --> 02:25:21.320]
Where they're making grotesque mistakes? I don't want to mention the Yankees and whether they'll really do what ought to be done

[02:25:21.320 --> 02:25:26.260]
Or whether they'll repeat the historical mistakes of neurotic compulsive

[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:33.140]
repetitive changes over and over and panic like they've been doing over and over again when I was on zeta

[02:25:33.140 --> 02:25:38.380]
I used to rip this place like crazy. They were laughing stock panic and panic and change and change and recycle

[02:25:38.380 --> 02:25:42.880]
Sandy and Bill and try to put Sandy on with Mike and it was a disaster. It was a joke

[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:46.820]
Okay, and they made a bad mistake with cane a terrible mistake

[02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:51.940]
They wrote test mistake and they screwed around and messed around a lot of our audience and drove them away and did a lot of

[02:25:51.940 --> 02:25:58.220]
Now the question is will they have the common sense to let things come down to worth and a start building instead of

[02:25:58.220 --> 02:26:03.240]
Constantly tearing down what we've got left from from Mike wasn't at a good speech sir

[02:26:04.100 --> 02:26:05.820]
Outstanding from Mike to stand

[02:26:05.820 --> 02:26:09.600]
I think is the next in a combination he just has to be worked on like Rick said

[02:26:10.140 --> 02:26:11.720]
Like uh or who was it?

[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:15.260]
Sud was just there. No, I think it was the dean

[02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:16.800]
Well, I

[02:26:17.260 --> 02:26:23.920]
It's a nice conversation but you just have to give it a while it seems like the management carry or whoever he is

[02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:28.680]
Say goodbye. Okay. Well, you have a good day. Thank you. He was getting pretty boring. Why don't you?

[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:33.200]
135 at W I O D we have a couple of open lines now that both in date county

[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:37.140]
It's very unlikely you'll get on with a cheerwood impress bill if we let them up 751

[02:26:37.140 --> 02:26:42.280]
W I O D and I have a sponsor to talk about not one of my favorite restaurants in the world

[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:48.200]
Really? I'm resting well. No, it's been an interesting four hours almost four hours

[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:53.640]
And it would have been more interesting as if we had any search in here don't ever ask me back on the show again

[02:26:54.280 --> 02:26:56.240]
Come on you had a great time

[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:03.180]
No, no, no, no too much pressure. No, it's just um, I don't know. I'm not comfortable

[02:27:03.180 --> 02:27:09.380]
I'm about about the last time you're here. We had a great time. Yeah, but I like that cheer you're red. Oh

[02:27:09.380 --> 02:27:13.600]
All right, you can see that some all kidding. Just here's a mobile on the turnpike

[02:27:15.180 --> 02:27:21.780]
Gone yeah, I'm here. You are there. Okay, sir. Neil. I mean you're 30 to 54 demographic. Yes, sir

[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:27.180]
I don't want to listen to topics. Yeah, I want to be entertained. I want to smile

[02:27:27.180 --> 02:27:30.660]
I just joking when I seem going to go back to topics because I'm never going to do that

[02:27:30.660 --> 02:27:32.140]
If I have to go to work in peoria

[02:27:32.140 --> 02:27:35.940]
I'm still going to have a good time on here. I don't want to go back to that because first of all it's boring

[02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:39.300]
And it's depressing and I just have no interest in it

[02:27:39.300 --> 02:27:42.840]
Well, you lose me and the other thing is flip around the AM dial

[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:47.960]
Who else is there to listen exactly? That's why I think a lot of this is really bogus and they're gonna sit in there

[02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:52.720]
They're gonna overreact and have a nervous breakdown and start messing around and messing around and messing around

[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:56.800]
And that's gonna be a mistake because that's what we're paying for now is all the messing around

[02:27:56.800 --> 02:27:57.360]
Exactly

[02:27:59.140 --> 02:28:03.300]
Listen to me since Steve Kane left this station which is back in October

[02:28:04.520 --> 02:28:10.180]
Nothing has stayed the same in other words. There've been just a succession of changes and several day parts

[02:28:10.180 --> 02:28:16.040]
Especially after the night changing and changing and changing and changing and it's got to the point now where the audience is

[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:18.100]
The audience likes stability, okay

[02:28:18.100 --> 02:28:18.780]
Exactly

[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:19.940]
And I want to find it

[02:28:19.940 --> 02:28:23.580]
Ralph Renek was not here for 30 years of Miami because he was a great news band

[02:28:23.580 --> 02:28:25.320]
They were just comfortable with him

[02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:26.140]
Comfortable like me

[02:28:26.140 --> 02:28:31.880]
Same with our morning show. I mean we're nearly as a great guy and everything but he's doesn't he's not dick pertin or how it's stern

[02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:37.160]
But they're comfortable with him. Okay. They like what he does their comfortable or used to me fits like an old glove

[02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:38.640]
And that's what people like

[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:40.680]
Yeah, but he loses me when he starts to play

[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:43.780]
Well, but see you're not you're I'm not looking for you to critique you

[02:28:43.780 --> 02:28:47.960]
I'm just trying to explain to you what it is stability is what keeps your audience

[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:52.980]
You're right not the pinhead audience. They're like the most fickle ones of other well, you know like on Monday

[02:28:52.980 --> 02:28:55.560]
More downy rules and Tuesday. It's

[02:28:56.100 --> 02:29:00.900]
Andrew douche clay and went to somebody else the pinhead audience is the most flaky audience of all

[02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:05.960]
But when you're talking about like 25 plus that audience a different story they like stability

[02:29:05.960 --> 02:29:09.880]
Exactly and one last thing I'd like to call my brother-in-law douche bag George

[02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:15.040]
Back okay, sir. I wasn't that that was like perfect topping on a cake, wouldn't in fact

[02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:20.040]
We're so convinced of what I just said we're gonna be doing the show next week from the stable area out of corder

[02:29:21.700 --> 02:29:27.140]
Okay, King of dance is gonna be our guest on Monday for Lauderdale. I need you. Yes, sir

[02:29:27.140 --> 02:29:32.700]
A couple things first ball. I'm part of your audience 25 plus and we never got a book

[02:29:33.160 --> 02:29:37.320]
A lot of people that listen didn't get the Arbiteron book to fill it out

[02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:43.840]
Now my first question from that end as your station to Massachusetts is where the hell did they send the books?

[02:29:44.220 --> 02:29:48.960]
Well, I'll buy the coast when the people come in on their rubber rants those are the ones who get the diaries now

[02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:54.120]
That's why all these ethnic stations are getting these enormous numbers and must have went down with those 36 that went under

[02:29:54.120 --> 02:30:00.260]
But the whole thing is you've got a lot of loyal listeners that we don't get a chance to express ourselves a lot of us don't stop and call

[02:30:00.260 --> 02:30:01.500]
I haven't stopped buying

[02:30:02.120 --> 02:30:04.600]
Because I was here and a lot of negative coming in that way

[02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:10.980]
Everybody's doing a good job. I'm not blowing smoke, but the whole thing is a lot of us didn't get books and the stations like I heard

[02:30:10.980 --> 02:30:16.740]
I think you said 105 got top numbers right just shows you when south of the border and

[02:30:17.120 --> 02:30:21.520]
You know a lot of us think a lot of your recommendations. I went to one of your famous fondue restaurants

[02:30:21.520 --> 02:30:23.740]
Yeah, and had a great dinner there

[02:30:23.740 --> 02:30:28.660]
Well, I'll give you an example okay the guys from American Sticking Pizza were in the other day and they're nice guys

[02:30:28.660 --> 02:30:30.000]
They have good great food

[02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:33.420]
And they've been on only for like I don't know last three or four months

[02:30:33.420 --> 02:30:37.920]
Which is when we've been going through all these down trends and everything and they came in not only did they bring in food

[02:30:37.920 --> 02:30:42.680]
But they thank me they said the results you've gotten us is so incredible and the same with Wayne Arnold

[02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:44.820]
They brought about 20 million dollars worth of food in the day

[02:30:44.820 --> 02:30:48.400]
Here's a guy with his little royal castle over there has been there for like 20 years or more

[02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:51.580]
And since he's been advertising on a show including right now

[02:30:52.060 --> 02:30:54.620]
We have he's broken all of his records okay?

[02:30:54.760 --> 02:30:58.100]
Jeff at the pizza loft and built a new neo-rodger's dining room up there

[02:30:58.100 --> 02:31:02.860]
Not because he loves me, but because of the fact we're bringing him tremendous business. He needed more room

[02:31:02.860 --> 02:31:06.020]
Okay, that indicates to me. We got a lot of people out there

[02:31:06.020 --> 02:31:08.120]
And I know you can't alibi about numbers forever

[02:31:08.120 --> 02:31:11.860]
But I think something is dramatically wrong up there in Beltsville

[02:31:11.860 --> 02:31:15.320]
I think they're interviewed there they're giving diaries to people who are like

[02:31:15.820 --> 02:31:18.020]
In our Katie or so I don't know what it is

[02:31:18.020 --> 02:31:22.220]
But I'm not buying it and I'm not doing the numbers on the or ever again. I will never do it again

[02:31:22.220 --> 02:31:24.840]
I was driving around call spring time to be lost on sample road

[02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:28.820]
And I saw I don't know if I can mention the restaurant or not, but what do your favorite fondue places?

[02:31:29.260 --> 02:31:32.080]
And I just said that's the place that Neil talked about

[02:31:32.080 --> 02:31:34.780]
Went in and have to find your waiter Troy

[02:31:34.780 --> 02:31:39.640]
Yeah, and I said if this isn't the restaurant Neil talking about that about coming in. Oh yeah

[02:31:39.640 --> 02:31:42.120]
No, no, we'll even and everybody's pretty talented

[02:31:42.120 --> 02:31:44.500]
Well, let me see as you've been the business long time

[02:31:45.080 --> 02:31:48.780]
Do you feel that maybe the summertime ratings go towards more like rock and roll?

[02:31:49.160 --> 02:31:53.660]
These aren't summertime. This is the spring. I thought this is a mason's April April May and June

[02:31:53.660 --> 02:31:56.580]
On April May June book. No, I don't think that's got anything to do with it

[02:31:56.580 --> 02:32:00.220]
Now I think I have more people around doors. I don't have time to sit down and fill out the book where

[02:32:00.220 --> 02:32:01.500]
A lot of the people just

[02:32:01.500 --> 02:32:07.100]
I just think Arbitron is lost it with their rating samplings that it started many many months ago

[02:32:07.100 --> 02:32:11.200]
I think even I think it started last June as a matter of fact over a year ago

[02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:15.360]
Well, unless they get the books out and distributive them evenly throughout the

[02:32:15.360 --> 02:32:20.760]
But what's your but the point is we can sit here and soon will electrolyze this from now sure next sookas

[02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:25.320]
But people in management aren't interested in that because they've got to cover their own ass

[02:32:25.320 --> 02:32:30.440]
They have to answer to the people up higher than them and they have to produce so they're not going to buy that

[02:32:30.440 --> 02:32:35.100]
Tell the people in management put the headset phones on set your seat and see how they like it for a while. Okay

[02:32:36.980 --> 02:32:42.520]
145 but you're a pseudo intellectual station w. I. O. D. Let's go to Fort Lauderdale. Hello. I want to kneel. Yes

[02:32:43.640 --> 02:32:47.400]
What is it Kevin? Yeah, Kilber's buddy. Yes, sir. So what's up?

[02:32:48.440 --> 02:32:52.920]
I'll see right here. I'm glad we got this call in before the end of the show. Okay

[02:32:52.920 --> 02:32:56.440]
We've been having a lot of these calls some of them, you know, maybe not that great

[02:32:56.440 --> 02:33:00.680]
But at least attempting to respond to what we've been talking about all day having some pretty good conversation

[02:33:00.680 --> 02:33:04.620]
And you call Kevin Gilbert's buddy. So what's up?

[02:33:05.120 --> 02:33:09.340]
What you guys are doing a great show, but what does that mean Kevin? What what is that? So what's up?

[02:33:09.420 --> 02:33:12.180]
Well, just more in Gilbert's like I said, I think the ratings are correct

[02:33:12.180 --> 02:33:16.920]
I think that most people with IQ of over six don't want to hear pinheads calling saying

[02:33:16.920 --> 02:33:21.660]
How you doing? What's up? I don't think people want to hear that well. I'm sorry Neil good

[02:33:21.660 --> 02:33:25.680]
I just wanted to say you want to be sorry Kevin and if I were you I'd stop

[02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:30.060]
associating with Gilbert immediately all right because it's affecting your credibility. No

[02:33:30.060 --> 02:33:36.860]
He's a good guy. What just called me. He's like in tears. Okay. See he's a good guy. He's in tears. Okay. Kevin

[02:33:36.860 --> 02:33:38.660]
How old are you about 25? Yeah

[02:33:39.180 --> 02:33:45.220]
25? Yeah, good guess right now. Don't you think it seriously? I'm not trying to put you on uh-huh

[02:33:45.220 --> 02:33:50.740]
Don't you think in your age yeah, that you could find something more constructive and meaningful to do

[02:33:50.740 --> 02:33:53.960]
Then be like babysitter to Gilbert the rest of your life

[02:33:53.960 --> 02:34:01.900]
Well, try to be more about Ernie Sochin and Norman Kent and Ed Till and the O'Rodgers and Bill Calder and Randy Martin

[02:34:01.900 --> 02:34:06.800]
I have a good name Michael. I am a cool. I'm not the point. I'm not don't even be evasive

[02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:11.820]
I'm trying to make a point to you. You're like compulsive. You're obsessed. This business is garbage

[02:34:11.820 --> 02:34:15.460]
Don't you understand that it is swill it is the if the pits

[02:34:15.460 --> 02:34:21.120]
It's like sucking barnacles off the bottom of the Titanic. Do you understand what I'm saying Kevin? Yeah, have a nice day

[02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:22.820]
Okay, did I tell him?

[02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:25.600]
Yeah, I like to weigh your handle that okay

[02:34:26.140 --> 02:34:31.900]
Well, I always have a master attacked here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hi. How are you both great?

[02:34:32.180 --> 02:34:36.740]
Go ahead. Let's say hello to Anna. I noticed Ross came back to a test drive my Corvette today

[02:34:36.740 --> 02:34:41.420]
Is that why you came in Ross? I noticed he had his eye on it same color as your shirt almost and what is it?

[02:34:41.820 --> 02:34:47.700]
Like say hello to Craig my physical therapist. I'll be there at three never mind your physical therapy

[02:34:47.700 --> 02:34:49.320]
If you want kind of crap, are you feeding?

[02:34:49.820 --> 02:34:53.420]
Okay, hello to an old friend from WHN. Oh

[02:34:53.420 --> 02:34:56.940]
My god. Oh my Sheila. I can't believe it don't

[02:34:56.940 --> 02:34:57.580]
Please

[02:34:58.820 --> 02:35:01.280]
Let it be Sheila if he wants it to be she

[02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:02.120]
No, I don't think it does

[02:35:03.260 --> 02:35:09.140]
That's why it's yeah, I don't think I don't think I think did she hang up now? She's there no she's there

[02:35:09.140 --> 02:35:16.900]
Whatever he wants her to be let her be all I know is that we miss it. I think that is the word that would fit in her go ahead

[02:35:21.020 --> 02:35:23.940]
We miss you a lot we miss hearing your voice

[02:35:23.940 --> 02:35:26.320]
Neil the hell with the rating

[02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:31.460]
You know what your audience thinks of you you know the audience but I want to explain

[02:35:31.460 --> 02:35:34.220]
I want to explain because I know this is getting really ponderous with the audience

[02:35:34.220 --> 02:35:36.600]
But when you know you're run and listen

[02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:40.200]
I really mean a Disney is a great guy. He really is. I like him as much as anybody

[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:44.160]
I've ever worked for but and there's always a big butt standing out okay

[02:35:44.940 --> 02:35:48.660]
They these people hired me based on my track record and a reputation in the market

[02:35:48.660 --> 02:35:54.500]
They're Johnny come lately in this market. They don't really understand what I do or what I've done or what I know or anything else about me

[02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:59.660]
They really don't and all they know is that I'm kind of a hothead and a pain in the ass and you know and make a lot of waves

[02:35:59.660 --> 02:36:06.300]
And all I know is that if you were working for people who really understood everything that's going on in the background

[02:36:06.300 --> 02:36:11.100]
And all the machinations of it then you have a little better feeling about it. Okay

[02:36:11.100 --> 02:36:15.840]
When you're working for people who are like panicky and oh, it's you what do we do now?

[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:19.120]
We better make a change because the things have been the same for three days in a row

[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:23.180]
You get a little bit this concerted is the word I would use to be diplomatic

[02:36:24.060 --> 02:36:26.880]
Disconcerted I understand like panic total panic

[02:36:26.880 --> 02:36:28.880]
Neil yesterday

[02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:33.160]
Rick and studs spoke to a DJ from Boynton Beach

[02:36:33.160 --> 02:36:37.620]
Who got thrown off the air because he played bands in the USA

[02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:42.000]
Okay, not because it was dirty, but because of bad pace

[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:47.980]
Hey, but it will play that crap out of get off. They threw him off. Oh god. It's a crappy record

[02:36:47.980 --> 02:36:56.020]
We don't need any more two-live crew on here. Okay, it's no no no. I'm trying I'm trying to bring out a point

[02:36:56.020 --> 02:37:02.680]
They threw him off in the middle of the record. They shoved him out the phones didn't stop bringing for two days

[02:37:02.680 --> 02:37:06.300]
Yeah, they brought him back on the third day because the listeners

[02:37:06.300 --> 02:37:08.580]
Well, let me tell you a little story about W.I.O.D

[02:37:08.580 --> 02:37:12.200]
They canned a sandy patent and Bill Smith here several years ago

[02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:17.780]
Okay, we're two of the most boring some nambulant people in the history not a broadcasting industry of the human race

[02:37:17.780 --> 02:37:23.000]
And the phones didn't stop bringing in and they brought him back by popular demand about two weeks later

[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:28.560]
And you know what they still had no numbers and they were still boring and a station still was a laughing stock, okay?

[02:37:28.980 --> 02:37:32.100]
Yes, so what you're saying is everybody has their following no matter who they are

[02:37:32.100 --> 02:37:35.140]
Well, man, let me tell you something boy this station

[02:37:35.860 --> 02:37:37.060]
Don't get booted in

[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:44.620]
And nobody called that's right and then they booted him out again and nobody called right

[02:37:44.620 --> 02:37:49.980]
But how did you get back the second time if nobody called the first time they were desperate? I changed my name

[02:37:49.980 --> 02:37:53.640]
Yeah, he said Guillermo and they didn't know what they were talking about

[02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:58.080]
You changed your name to Bill Smith, right? Yeah, no sandy calder

[02:37:58.980 --> 02:38:00.300]
No, that's true though

[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:05.180]
What you say what did you say whatever I said whatever you said was good

[02:38:05.180 --> 02:38:08.420]
You liked the billboard, but the teacher being a big land, right?

[02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:12.360]
Okay, the billboard stuck. Oh, did you listen to me in New York when I was there?

[02:38:12.620 --> 02:38:15.300]
HN sure did I was good then one thing

[02:38:15.300 --> 02:38:15.820]
You're good

[02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:19.120]
I was

[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:22.100]
You're still funny. No, I'm not funny anymore. I'm laughing

[02:38:22.100 --> 02:38:25.500]
That's why I say those things because you accused me of never paying a compliment

[02:38:25.500 --> 02:38:29.800]
But if you don't pay me a compliment, I don't mean it, but I'm not right. Listen

[02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:32.760]
You got to take another do we have another break to do here, Marvin? I think

[02:38:33.540 --> 02:38:36.900]
You're sure that okay, I would love to continue talking to you because you're just wonderful

[02:38:36.900 --> 02:38:42.600]
You are you're probably in boy I lifted us from our depression. Wait you please listen to one more thing

[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:44.740]
Okay, both of you be healthy

[02:38:45.300 --> 02:38:50.260]
God for your health and the rest of the crap go to hell exactly let them all right to that

[02:38:50.260 --> 02:38:53.000]
Okay, I'm gonna have a little bird talk and see you

Bye-bye. Okay, 151 at W.I.D. Henry's got a little something for you before we leave and we'll be right back

[02:38:59.620 --> 02:39:05.260]

No, that guy from Eli Turgerman. Exactly. No, no, no, tell him any way that kids are rules anyway. Okay

[02:39:23.060 --> 02:39:29.220]
I got a suggestion for you. Who is Eli Turgerman? He's some crooked mayor here in surfside. Oh

[02:39:29.220 --> 02:39:34.060]
Yeah, oh in other words, it really is such a person. Yeah, yeah, he's a good man. Well, the hell with him. We don't give a damn

[02:39:34.060 --> 02:39:36.840]
Yeah, we don't care and it's thinking mayor and Hollywood man is

Banned sunglasses because it the reflects on his answer something to hell with him. Yeah, that guy's a gentsan for you

[02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:48.780]
No, he's upset about the copper towing thing or the other one with the naked butt and all that's oh man

[02:39:48.780 --> 02:39:50.680]
Holly with her just sick. Yeah

[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:56.320]
Even my mother's getting fed up with holly. We go ahead pal. Yeah, um, I got a suggestion for you since those

[02:39:56.320 --> 02:39:57.820]
Spanish A and stations are

That's such great numbers and are and Orlando bosses got that level to two hour

[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:08.080]
He's got that liberty. You can always have as a sidekick. Yeah, it's true. I'm 11 to two

[02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:13.620]
Yeah, get some of the Spanish listeners on your feet. Oh yeah now that and look at that TV real quick. Look at that. Oh geez

[02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:17.540]
Two live crew is back on area and we can't talk about the who's in between

[02:40:18.060 --> 02:40:26.380]
Oh, listen, thanks for the suggestion pal. Alright, I have a good when is this okay? Okay. We're gonna start speaking a little bit like every other word is gonna be an esponial

[02:40:27.180 --> 02:40:31.840]
Did you hear that about now the rumor is that they pay a ethnic five dollars for the diaries?

[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:34.100]
I've heard of it for a hangos only a buck

[02:40:34.100 --> 02:40:35.620]
I don't know that that's true

[02:40:35.620 --> 02:40:41.960]
And if it and if it's used they make they make them pay 250 for their diary to count us seriously

[02:40:42.940 --> 02:40:48.780]
They buy it all those old stereotypes a west pound beach. Hey guys. How you doing, sir? Hi pal

[02:40:48.780 --> 02:40:51.960]
Hey, listen, uh, I think I got it figured out. Okay

[02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:57.180]
As far as bills concerned and Rick and putt. You know like bill tries to compliment

[02:40:58.160 --> 02:41:00.020]
Rick and putt. You don't let um

[02:41:00.020 --> 02:41:00.240]
Uh

[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:04.640]
People call in trying to compliment bill. You don't let him you want to get rid of them

[02:41:05.140 --> 02:41:10.580]
So what's the deal? The only is it like you're insecure. You can't handle it. Someone else is getting compliment on your

[02:41:10.580 --> 02:41:14.820]
Radio show exactly. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Let's go to

[02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:18.820]
Miami. Hello. Yeah, that was a great call. Yeah, he's always a great great

[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:26.680]
Diary. Yeah. Yeah, uh, he's listening to radio mombi. He just started stopping call. He's not listening speaking of radio mombi

[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:32.180]
Yeah, you know your billboard that was in high a lea on 103rd street off the pound that's a good place for it

[02:41:32.180 --> 02:41:33.920]
Well, you know what that was replaced with

[02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:39.960]
The four guys from radio mombi. Uh-huh. That's what it was covered up with. Well it takes four guys to replace him

[02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:45.180]
That's correct. That's that you cover up the bed. The yellows billboard with the city of plantation. Yeah

[02:41:45.780 --> 02:41:49.060]
Well, you know when bill called the first came in this morning sounded a little weak

[02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:54.760]
And he sounds much better now. Oh, and now he's just he just getting going now. Did he start sweating when he ate that white hot?

[02:41:55.760 --> 02:42:00.160]
Nobody's starting to sweat now that you're talking about him. No, seriously though. Uh, he's doing great

[02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:05.480]
You know, you you talk about the numbers coming out and and never again. This is your last day for it never again

[02:42:05.480 --> 02:42:11.020]
Well, you know, you know what it is bottom line. I have a son that's 13 years old. Yeah, all of his face show on

[02:42:11.020 --> 02:42:19.440]
Well, what are they listening to? W. E. D. R. Okay, with that rap stuff. Okay. That's what they all listen to. We're not we're not competing for that market

[02:42:19.860 --> 02:42:25.380]
Absolutely not I know I understand that but you know when you start going and you see see people and they're talking about

[02:42:25.380 --> 02:42:28.440]
Rick and suds Rick and suds. Or did you hear what Neil said?

[02:42:29.020 --> 02:42:33.840]
How come when they come out with numbers like this? Where do these other people get these books from?

[02:42:34.500 --> 02:42:39.580]
I sampled things and where did all our audience go? I mean like I said they're not listening to hot 105

[02:42:39.580 --> 02:42:44.420]
They're certainly not listening to the E. D. R. They're not listening to a life or joy or the coast

[02:42:44.420 --> 02:42:48.380]
Where did all of these news talk or what are entertainment people go?

[02:42:48.380 --> 02:42:51.740]
And the fact is if you look through you can't find them. They're nowhere. They're gone

[02:42:51.740 --> 02:42:54.500]
This is why the sampling that they take

[02:42:54.500 --> 02:43:00.380]
So if you take a sampling of people that watch television and and you talk to I would say

[02:43:00.760 --> 02:43:05.560]
Out of 10 people six or seven will tell you that they watch an alien nation. They happen to like that show

[02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:08.820]
Yeah, 80 second in the ratings. I mean when did they get these?

[02:43:08.980 --> 02:43:14.020]
Are they are they sample of people like out in a swamp someone? You know what you want me to answer the question?

[02:43:14.140 --> 02:43:16.120]
You want to get them where howl and deal

[02:43:17.380 --> 02:43:20.980]
I should be from somewhere does that answer your question does that tell you a lot?

[02:43:21.180 --> 02:43:25.300]
It it hallowed be then all 2000 diaries this time we're in hallowed bill

[02:43:25.300 --> 02:43:29.200]
Well, I'll tell you in a lot of and half of them were in sunny Rosenberg's house

[02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:34.320]
I have never heard of rick and such before they came to this this station right okay

[02:43:34.320 --> 02:43:39.400]
You talk to people now everybody knows about rick and such I think they they talk about

[02:43:39.820 --> 02:43:45.680]
They're funny. Are they keep that afternoon going? I mean it's some of the stuff where they play off one another do remember the

[02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:47.760]
The guys used to do the

[02:43:49.560 --> 02:43:55.340]
Trying to get that beer they used to do a beer commercial up in New York they were merge beer. Yeah, no, no the two the

[02:43:55.340 --> 02:43:55.900]
Merton Harry

[02:43:55.900 --> 02:44:02.000]
Harry, okay, how they play off one another and the other ones like looking at what did you say? Yeah, that's the what they remind me of

[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:08.020]
And yet they play off one another and everybody knows about them. How could their ratings possibly go down exactly

[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:11.020]
That's what it's give us at least me

[02:44:11.020 --> 02:44:13.440]
Absolutely did a greater okay

[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:18.520]
Bert Simpson he rules okay, okay, that's gonna do a bill. It's been something

[02:44:19.100 --> 02:44:22.700]
Well, it certainly has certainly been an agonizing experience

[02:44:22.700 --> 02:44:27.040]
We didn't have anybody sneaking any compliments for it because I'd be pretty upset about it

[02:44:29.900 --> 02:44:36.380]
Anyway, Bill Carter. He'll be back with us in spite of all I will never come in back here until you talk about numbers

[02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:38.880]
Bill will be back with us tomorrow

[02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:42.580]
Ha ha ha ha not be back with us next Monday when the whole book comes in there

[02:44:42.580 --> 02:44:47.500]
We go around for a hour when you see QAM but at listen QAM.1 in the morning

[02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:51.960]
Something to think about he just stopped in mid-Satins. That's Randy's number by the way

[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:59.060]
Have a great day. Rick and thanks for having me on. Oh always a pleasure. Terri Lynn Taylor author of the messengers of blight at three o'clock
