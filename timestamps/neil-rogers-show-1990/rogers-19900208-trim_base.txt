[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]
for four hours and then everybody jumps on the bandwagon.

[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.100]
So I'm not going to follow in Bill's footsteps on this because I think it would be wrong to

[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.580]
blow Gilbert off the show entirely because I enjoy him and I just don't want to overdo it.

[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.740]
I mean he's everywhere now. He's just all over the place.

[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.460]
And he even, somebody even called him while I was sitting here with Roger sitting in his

[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.720]
studio when Mike was on a few minutes ago and called said,

[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.280]
the catch you get Gilbert on with Mike on he showed him tomorrow morning?

[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.640]
That would be like having Sandy come in tomorrow, you know, to do sugar cookies again.

[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.800]
I'm sorry, but let's just come back to reality.

[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.140]
Okay. Man, this market is pathetic.

[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.780]
It's like somebody tells a joke on show A and it's funny.

[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.780]
And all of a sudden they're like 10 other guys in a market telling the same joke.

[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.160]
I just, I'm sorry, I don't get it.

[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.880]
So Gilbert, you can call or stop and every now and then.

[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.500]
It's like a peepy in Pember Pines.

[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.100]
He calls like once a month or something or what's every few weeks and he's funny,

[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.200]
but we don't overdo it. I hate when people drive stuff into the ground.

[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.720]
And what I heard yesterday afternoon, I think we do have to get that guy

[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.780]
or some cheesecake or whatever it is that he keeps squealing about because he just lost.

[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.540]
I think it's the word getting lost somewhere in the shuffle.

[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.480]
Nice guy Alex, but let's not, I mean Tuesday it was like,

[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.820]
Jay, oh, I'm nice.

[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.340]
Sick of that and you're never going to hear that on this show and we don't.

[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.700]
And then all of a sudden yesterday he's got the guy in here exploiting him and at

[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.960]
broad that he had in here with him and some of the callers were really

[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.500]
making fun of badly poorly and I thought it was in crappy taste.

[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.100]
And I think that, well listen, that's just my opinion.

[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.880]
Okay, as far as the other thing is concerned that took place yesterday,

[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.020]
I'll get into that after the break, but I have quite a bit to say about that.

[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.140]
I think the, and I thank the people from Channel 6 all the way.

[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.140]
I have no idea why they stuck around for four hours.

[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.040]
I guess they must have been amused by the show and they had a little piece there on the 630 news last night.

[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.660]
But four hours, there must have been something else going on in town beside the bird, you know,

[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.060]
for four hours yesterday that they could have been covering,

[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.080]
like lunch at the Rascal House or anything.

[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.060]
Anyway speaking of Alex, he seems to be enjoying those wings from wing.

[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.340]
Really?

[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.920]
1015 W.5.

[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.540]
Dicky.

[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.720]
And what can I say?

[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.900]
It's some interesting stuff going on.

[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.780]
Anyway, what was I going to tell you?

[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.080]
Oh, yeah, but yesterday I want to give you the story behind the story.

[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.900]
If of course you're interested, we know this audience isn't too much into that kind of stuff.

[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.500]
But let me give you a little background or what took place here yesterday.

[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.680]
It seems that when we made the offer to the bird to come on the show, I think it was on Monday I had the

[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.160]
Nick Column and within 20 seconds he respectfully declined and cut him short and goodbye and good luck to you.

[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.640]
At that point he thought the story was going to be a real razor blade job because that's what he gave

[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.260]
as Albert Sturren, the guy who wrote the article for New Times.

[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.240]
And the reason I know that, in spite of any denials that he might make, is that Sturren was here last Friday.

[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.180]
And read to me several lines or paragraphs from what the bird had told him during that interview at his house.

[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.060]
And I mean, he called me everything under the sun.

[00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.000]
It was a razor blade job.

[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.780]
Now, the reason it didn't come out in print like that is because basically the people at New Times

[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.060]
like me and they like the show.

[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.620]
In addition to which there's some people over there, I think he's a twerp, okay?

[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.620]
And so it really kind of backfired.

[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.220]
And they turned it around and it really was a lot different than he thought it was going to be.

[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.260]
And he even told Fat Rich, which I know, even though Rich is a trouble making,

[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.340]
and I know this is true, he told me it was very nervous and concerned about how the

[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.180]
Sturren was going to come out in print because he really had done a wicked, I mean a vicious razor blade job.

[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.080]
So that's why he wasn't going to come in.

[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.400]
Then the thing comes out, he gets a hold of it Monday night or Tuesday night.

[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.240]
And then he changes his game plan.

[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.440]
So now he shows up here yesterday and you saw the thing on 6 where they interviewed him outside,

[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.400]
I guess it must have been.

[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.680]
And his game plan was that he was going to come sneaking in here.

[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.440]
He's going to wait for us to start attacking him.

[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.440]
And after the first word, he's going to come rushing in here and say,

[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.220]
what's the big deal?

[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.300]
Four days of bashing in the article is nothing.

[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.560]
What's all this hysteria about?

[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.520]
And that was his game plan.

[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.940]
Well, it comes to find out that he was intercepted in the hallway by Boy Geary.

[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.460]
And he said, what are you doing here?

[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.500]
And he said, well, I'm going to go in and defend myself.

[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.820]
And I said, no, you're not.

[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.400]
He said, we invited you to come.

[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.600]
You turned it down and now you're just going to sneak in there.

[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.700]
And it's not going to happen.

[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.360]
So that was the reason they were, you know,

[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.000]
asked him to leave the premises because again,

[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.480]
he was doing it in a sneaky, devious way instead of just to...

[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.160]
And I'm going to say something about that.

[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.100]
I'm not going to say we're going to go into Guinness Book of Records.

[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.600]
I don't know of any radio station in the history of this business that aspired somebody.

[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.720]
And then two months later invited him to come back to defend himself.

[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.640]
I never heard such a thing.

[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.940]
I don't think it's ever happened before.

[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.700]
I could be wrong.

[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.900]
And if anybody knows of it, please let me know.

[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.660]
But I don't think so.

[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.100]
I think it's a radio first in the history of the business.

[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.280]
It just doesn't happen.

[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.320]
You get fired.

[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.920]
You're gone.

[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.500]
You disappear.

[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.060]
You know, that we talk about it all the time.

[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.660]
You're gone.

[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.560]
And I say, oh, wow, he went to seek better opportunities in, you know, whatever.

[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.240]
And that's the way the business works.

[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.520]
So here's the guy who we were going to give four hours voluntarily,

[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.020]
who was then going to be devious,

[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.940]
kind of sit back, wait and see the lay of the land and how the article came out.

[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.660]
And then when it wasn't quite so bad,

[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.980]
then he's going to come in here and try to soft pedal it and be Mr. Nice Guy.

[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.680]
I really think it was like sucking around for his job back a little bit.

[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.440]
I could be wrong.

[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.800]
And to come to find out when he left here, he thought that it did him a lot of good.

[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.340]
Like, they're going to be pounding on his door,

[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.020]
I'm not going to down to offer him jobs.

[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.600]
Nobody's been doing that for two months.

[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.780]
And certainly after that pathetic performance yesterday,

[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.480]
it isn't going to happen now.

[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.500]
And some of you, I mean, I let everybody have their say yesterday,

[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.260]
there were a couple of them that irritated me because they just were looking for trouble.

[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.900]
That was obvious.

[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.300]
But I mean, some of you but bird liquors that just cannot stop.

[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.660]
Like that one young Cuban guy,

[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.000]
and he said that same thing so many times since December that it just,

[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.840]
he must have it in blazing in his brain.

[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.920]
And he called yesterday, kept repeating,

[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.620]
and did you say in these exact words, did you tell him this?

[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.480]
I got news for you.

[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.900]
I'll mind your own God's and business.

[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.220]
Okay, don't have those.

[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.380]
Huts put a call in here and tell me what I should do and how I should have said it.

[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.320]
I mean, this is life.

[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.220]
This is real life.

[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.900]
This is reality.

[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.620]
And that's what Mr. Burdbrains got to grow up in the face.

[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.320]
He's got to work.

[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.300]
He's got to work and crying over spilt milk is going to get the job done.

[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.840]
Did he make himself look better yesterday?

[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.920]
No. They don't look like a jerk.

[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.500]
And whatever respect I may have had for him at all,

[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.700]
as of last December, when we parted company,

[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.060]
I mean, by now it's gone.

[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.440]
It's completely gone because his behavior has been just pathetic.

[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.360]
And he goes through this big song and a dance about,

[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.740]
well, when we left here, he wanted to see other people and do what that was just fine

[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.700]
because I feel the same way.

[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.920]
Then why was he belly-icking in the article about, well, I thought we could be friends

[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.060]
and maybe go to the track?

[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.880]
Why would I associate with him now that I've fired him?

[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.540]
Well, I didn't associate with him when he was here.

[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.460]
We're working together.

[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.620]
Okay, it doesn't make any sense.

[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.980]
None of it makes any sense.

[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.840]
But it was pathetic.

[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.740]
It was demeaning.

[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.580]
It was just a tragedy.

[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.740]
But I'm glad that we did it.

[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.020]
I'm glad we went through the exercise.

[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.520]
Because now he's got no more sour grapes.

[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.400]
He had his opportunity.

[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.280]
He was given plenty of chance to say his piece.

[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.440]
And quite frankly, when I put him on,

[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.180]
when he was sneaking around in the newsroom,

[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.360]
I wasn't really sure whether they were very upset.

[00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:59.880]
You know, if I did put him on,

[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.960]
they were going to have a nervous breakdown

[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.900]
because they were not happy he was in the building

[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.220]
under those circumstances.

[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.500]
I'm talking about, of course, management.

[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.320]
So that was the real story behind the story.

[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.400]
Okay, the way all of us went down yesterday.

[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.360]
Paul Lyle, Gilbert Report.

[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.360]
Oh, that ought to be exciting.

[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.900]
See what I mean?

[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.020]
It's just, it's like, and of course,

[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.300]
part of it is Gilbert's fault, too,

[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.260]
because he's out of control.

[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.900]
He's calling every show in town now

[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.060]
because he's been exploited to the point now.

[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.900]
He feels like he's just out of control.

[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.800]
And I'm not ripping him by saying that,

[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.000]
but I'm just telling you, Gilbert,

[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.620]
that it's just getting to be a little much.

[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.020]
What does it say, Gilbert, wouldn't leave?

[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.680]
Or I got news for you.

[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.780]
It's not the point.

[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.980]
The point is that people, I mean,

[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.100]
if you want to sit in the audience and cack a little bit,

[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.880]
that was one thing.

[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.240]
But the brutal, I mean, the way he was brutalized yesterday

[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.240]
was unconscionable.

[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:49.680]
It really was.

[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.280]
I mean, there were people.

[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.380]
I heard a lot of it, and people making fun of him.

[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.100]
Alice wanted them to leave.

[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.600]
Well, you know, come right out and say,

[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.520]
Gilbert's time to go.

[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.340]
Audio is goodbye.

[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.640]
That would have been the way I would have done it.

[00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:58.900]

[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.160]
But, like I said, I'm a little curious

[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.340]
why a guy on Tuesday,

[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.880]
who was adamant that there was just too much,

[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.000]
Gilbert and he was sick of it.

[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.520]
He was nauseated, but was asking if he could borrow him

[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.400]
for a few minutes yesterday.

[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.760]
I just don't understand that.

[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.380]
I'm sure Alex will clarify for us

[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.500]
when he comes in today.

[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.520]
21 past 10 at WIO.

[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.060]
Dave will want to tell you about Reno's.

[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.440]
We're at the world famous Cafe Bar Fade.

[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.860]
We've replaced one of the patrons.

[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.480]
Fresh ground coffee with soldiers crippled.

[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.320]
Let's see if he notices.

[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.660]
Mmm, good coffee.

[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:30.900]
Can you pack the creamer?

[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.240]
We've replaced the creamer with ground up chalk.

[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:34.380]
Let's see if he notices.

[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:36.980]
Can you pack the sugar?

[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.460]
We've replaced the sugar with ground up freeze-dried white mice.

[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.600]
Let's see if he notices.

[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.700]
I wonder if he'll notice what we replaced the lemon with.

[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.080]
Okay, it's

[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.940]
26th and 10th at WIO.

[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.340]
Dave, something with his overhead today.

[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.680]
Let's take some calls here.

[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:57.800]
Okay, because I've already said enough.

[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.700]
Here's a Paul Lyle Gilbert report.

[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:01.640]
Gone.

[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:02.540]
Okay, good start.

[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.840]
I like when you go to that first call

[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.680]
and you're gone.

[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.440]
Well, let me tell you something.

[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.880]
Okay, I had some stuff that I wanted to say this morning

[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.720]
and excuse me for taking your valuable time for saying it.

[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.280]
Whoever the hell that was.

[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.060]
Anybody was listening to Paul Lyle anyway.

[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.000]
How smart can they be?

[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.380]
Fort Waterdale.

[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.100]
Yes.

[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:18.920]
I heard

[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.840]
Nolesce show that it's a powerful

[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.320]
Gilbert might be taking over the show.

[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.440]
Yeah, right.

[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.700]
I mean, I'm ready to throw myself out on

[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.840]
Broward Boulevard that happened.

[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:29.680]
Sure.

[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.620]
Just a joke, okay?

[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.320]
Oh, okay.

[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.240]
Just a little joke.

[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.160]
Okay, I got the...

[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.660]
I had a good time yesterday listening to that show.

[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.240]
It was very entertaining, but it was pathetic.

[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.040]
It wasn't...

[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.760]
It wasn't that he was also entertaining.

[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.720]
He was entertaining, but it was pathetic.

[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:45.960]
It's tragic.

[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.440]
Well, I want to tell you something that was more tragic

[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.680]
and maybe that is entertaining, but I went to the city of

[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.840]
Pemberk Pine, the city of the city of Meanlast night.

[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.760]
And you had to see them arguing over whether or not to reduce the price of a hole

[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.760]
from 500 to 300 and how they were going to the

[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.720]
simple math on what the actual course of

[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.460]
running on a hole took about 15 minutes.

[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:12.960]
I mean, it was just...

[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.860]
Well, it sounds pretty pathetic and we thank you so much.

[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.580]
28 after 10 at WID.

[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.500]
Come on, cut the crap.

[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.800]
Well, yeah, cut the crap.

[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.720]
Of Pemberk Pine, speak of the devil.

[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.020]
Yeah, knew how you don't.

[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.360]
Okay.

[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.240]
All right, listen, just a couple of comments

[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.460]
on what you've been talking about.

[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.620]
Yesterday, I happened to be driving.

[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.180]
I caught a little bit of Alex's event

[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.380]
and that really was a terrible job

[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.540]
with they were doing on Gilbert.

[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.480]
Yeah, it was horrendous, actually.

[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.720]
Really, and that...

[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.600]
And the Joey did the same thing.

[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.460]
And of course Gilbert is just having a good time.

[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.500]
He doesn't realize it, but...

[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.940]
And I'm not trying to be holier than now,

[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.840]
but there are some of us.

[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.020]
I think Bill knows how to do it.

[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:44.880]
And I think I've done it.

[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.740]
At least I've tried to have fun with Gilbert

[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.780]
as opposed to just massacring him

[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.580]
and making a mockery of him,

[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.960]
which is a lot of what I heard yesterday.

[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.580]
It was awful.

[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.520]
Yeah, I think he was just trying to impress

[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.540]
that Barreg Brody had on with him.

[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.840]
Well, though, let's turn this into a rip Alex thing.

[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.740]
Although, I don't know why not.

[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.420]
But, yeah, we don't have to do that.

[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.380]
But I just find it very bizarre that on Tuesday,

[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.880]
he was totally burnt out with Gilbert.

[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.120]
He was disgusted and fed up.

[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.500]
And he did have a very valid point.

[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.600]
I mean, it's getting ridiculous.

[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.020]
And then all of a sudden yesterday,

[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.600]
it turns around into a four-hour...

[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.640]
A marathon.

[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:18.940]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:19.760]
Neil? Yeah.

[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.640]
One other thing. I hope this Barreg thing

[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.180]
is if totally put the bed now.

[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.680]
It's... I mean, I'm not saying we're not going to talk about it,

[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.860]
but as far as him, he comes in here again

[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.400]
and be wasting the gas to come here.

[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.860]
Okay? He's had his last gas fun this show.

[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.260]
Yeah, because the only...

[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.300]
To summarize, the summary that I get out of it

[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.700]
is that he's nothing but a...

[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.440]
lemon.

[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.500]
Talent with...

[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.160]
Really mouth-cackling moon.

[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:41.620]
Lemon.

[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:42.860]
Have a great taste.

[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:43.540]
All right, bye.

[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.900]
Yeah, I'm disgusted with him.

[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.480]
I really am.

[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.580]
And, you know, finally,

[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.040]
I tried to be reasonable.

[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:48.840]
I really did...

[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:49.640]
And...

[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.140]
I bet over backward to be reasonable.

[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.400]
And a lot of people that, you know,

[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.560]
were sympathetic toward him to call and have a lot of time.

[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.320]
Because I didn't want him to come...

[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.960]
Well, see, I told you if I came in here,

[00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:58.920]
I wouldn't get a chance to say

[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.280]
and I gave him all the opportunity in the world.

[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.260]
And I kept giving him all this extra time

[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.560]
to think of all these reasons.

[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.760]
And the only thing he had to say was

[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.040]
it's not easy working for you.

[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.620]
Well, nobody held a gun to his head

[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.880]
and forced him to come in

[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.660]
and cackle and eat those free meals every day.

[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.220]
Okay, nobody forced him to do it.

[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.960]
In fact, when you look back on it,

[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.800]
if it was so difficult,

[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.160]
then maybe I did him a big favor.

[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.180]
Because it was such a pain in the ass working with me.

[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.260]
But, cheese, to come in and for four hours,

[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.020]
wine, and so finally,

[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.220]
I lost my cool at one point.

[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.100]
Some of you may have heard it.

[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.600]
And I really laced into it.

[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:29.900]
And I said,

[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.700]
haven't you been listening?

[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.400]
Doesn't anything penetrate your ears?

[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.320]
Don't you get the message?

[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.280]
I'm going to sit here and I'm going to talk about

[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.400]
whatever I want to talk about.

[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.200]
And it's my show.

[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.920]
And I'm not going to put up with temper tantrums.

[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.920]
And the people in the building

[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.920]
don't want to put up with your rotten temper

[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.840]
and your nasty disposition.

[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:43.900]
And that's it.

[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:44.460]
You're gone.

[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:45.540]
Oh,

[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.180]
oh, like all of a sudden,

[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.800]
you can see that little GE light bulb

[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.800]
lighting up over his head, you know.

[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.580]
Over his dome.

[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.720]
Now, he really makes me nauseous.

[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.660]
Okay, I hope he and Johnny

[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.240]
dark have a wonderful life together.

[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.800]
And they can run around,

[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.640]
writing letters to everybody else in the industry,

[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.100]
telling them how none of us know anything

[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.840]
and they know it all and et cetera, et cetera.

[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.080]
And maybe someday one or both of them will get a job.

[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:07.520]
Miami.

[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.340]
Dale.

[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.240]
Yeah, how you doing?

[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:09.600]
Okay.

[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.600]
First off, I'd like to say

[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.480]
10 times better without the bird.

[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.700]
I don't even know what you had in the first.

[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:15.600]
Well, you know, it's interesting even

[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.060]
some of the people who were defending in the

[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.460]
industry were saying that they missed them.

[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.820]
They said, what we got to admit,

[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.200]
they show us a little better

[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.620]
when that boy he got the all-been

[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.520]
out of shape about that.

[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.120]
Yeah, it's like 10 times better.

[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.760]
I don't even know how you had him on the first place.

[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.600]
Excellent point.

[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.200]
A moron.

[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:28.600]
He should.

[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.480]
Well, no, that's not.

[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.040]
That's not to say a moron.

[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.260]
Just say a cackling idiot.

[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.280]
Well, moron.

[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:34.340]
Close.

[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.500]
Moron is crass.

[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.000]
Yeah.

[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.560]
Cackling idiot has a little

[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:38.320]
flair.

[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.140]
Yeah.

[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.700]
I mean, 10 times better

[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.480]
than I wanted to say.

[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:42.460]
And good luck.

[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.380]
Thank you, Senator.

[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.000]
I'm glad you did.

[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.660]
Okay, a little minor stuff there.

[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.140]
It's 1031 at WIOD.

[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.680]
We have an opening in Dade County now.

[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:50.600]
If you move very fast,

[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.480]
it's kind of like the post-mortem.

[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.380]
And I also, the thing about Gilbert is very,

[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.860]
I'm not kidding around about that.

[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.920]
I'm just disgusted with it.

[00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:58.840]
With this, this to me,

[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.620]
it like it pitimizes the entire market.

[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.700]
And like I said before, Gilbert has to take a lot

[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.320]
of the blame for that.

[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.900]
I heard he called Larry King last night.

[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.420]
And was doing a lowly $50 routine.

[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.440]
I didn't hear it myself,

[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.900]
but I heard a little spy report.

[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.960]
And I mean, Gilbert, you just,

[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.680]
you can't, you can't be like Tom Hanks.

[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.020]
You know, you can't do 800 movies all in the same week.

[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.200]
There are only a few people who can do that,

[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.420]
like Gamali Ringworm.

[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.020]
But now I still, you know,

[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.540]
if he wants to come in once in a great while,

[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.700]
if he wants to call once in a while,

[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.360]
he can get through.

[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.760]
You know, he's always telling me he can't get through.

[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.040]
I have no problem with that.

[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.900]
I'm not going to blow him off,

[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.240]
but I'm going to try to slow,

[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.560]
put the brakes on a little bit,

[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.900]
because it's getting ridiculous.

[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.900]
Just, it also speaking to me,

[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.780]
Nicholas, did you hear what Stan said on a promo

[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.740]
about how he, I didn't hear his show last night?

[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.640]
He took the poll and Terry Miriaman beat his Elf Hernandez.

[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:43.840]
I got news for you, man.

[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.200]
It's no wonder we have so many optometrist in this town.

[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.440]
And don't tell me that I don't know a beautiful look

[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.400]
in woman when I see one,

[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.560]
because I do and Terry Miriaman is not too exciting.

[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:53.920]
Okay.

[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.720]
I mean, his Elf Hernandez has got better looks

[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.660]
on her fingernails than the Terry Miriaman

[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.320]
in her whole body.

[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.540]
It's not even a contest.

[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.880]
What are you guys looking at?

[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.520]
Are you nuts?

[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.920]
Oh, you really need some serious help.

[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.760]
It's a 1033, a WIOD Toyota.

[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.080]
I'm dying out of here.

[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.760]
WIU, I love you.

[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.500]
1036, a WIOD Volca.

[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:17.660]
I am now.

[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.340]
Yes, sir.

[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.260]
I thought we was going to tell Glyna new

[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.720]
eggsuiter yesterday.

[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.580]
I thought you were born?

[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.840]
I thought we was going to tell you a new eggsuiter yesterday.

[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.460]
Meaning what?

[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.360]
Meaning, I thought you was pretty light on it.

[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:31.920]
Yeah.

[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.140]
Intentionally, I didn't want him belly-ikin

[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.320]
about the fact that when he came in,

[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.320]
we didn't give him a chance.

[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:37.480]
Uh-huh.

[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.040]
Uh-huh.

[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:39.380]
Uh-huh.

[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:39.540]
Yeah.

[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.240]
Listen to a couple of ideas,

[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.740]
not that they're smooth, but it's slow.

[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:43.480]
Yeah.

[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.720]
Well, just like this call,

[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.600]
let's go to a call to spy report in Miami.

[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:47.940]
Hello.

[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.760]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.660]
Where's it, Hylia?

[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.000]
Well, whichever.

[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:51.580]
Hmm.

[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.580]
It's sort of on the borderline.

[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.380]
You know, I got to get out my border path

[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.440]
to go across the street.

[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.600]
Right on the cutting edge.

[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.000]
Yeah, I've written in your buddy belt this morning

[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.440]
and he blew you up and off-pause him,

[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.660]
not to call his show anymore.

[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.120]
Can I just say that a little while ago?

[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:05.980]
Oh, I didn't hear you.

[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.760]
I've been in and out of the vehicle all day.

[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:08.240]
And uh-

[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:08.880]
Who didn't know that, huh?

[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.600]
And you know how it is.

[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:10.960]
Mm-hmm.

[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.180]
Uh-huh.

[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.320]
Yeah, I got a good way for you to, uh,

[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.260]
study with your satellite situation.

[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.980]
I'm going to write you a letter and explain how you can

[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.840]
legally do it.

[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.200]
And, uh, the federal government will back you 100 percent.

[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:22.920]
Right.

[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.460]
I will write you a little letter,

[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.280]
put a little information packet in there.

[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.640]
If you're interested, give us a call,

[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.860]
and we'll be glad to help you out.

[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.220]
Okay.

[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:29.760]
Thank you.

[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.360]
Have a good day.

[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.980]
You too, 1037 WIOD Tamarack.

[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:34.520]
Nail.

[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:34.940]
Yeah.

[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.840]
I got to tell you, I haven't heard anything or seen anything

[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.620]
like yesterday's show since Jim and Tammy were on Nightline.

[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.120]
Yeah.

[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.740]
I mean, one of the site benefits, one of the site benefits

[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.620]
of yesterday's show for me personally speaking was that, uh,

[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.500]
I finally realized I wasn't the only person that got treated

[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.400]
like a piece of crap at one of the personal appearances there.

[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:56.920]
Uh, I was-

[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.480]
Well, let me-

[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.020]
There was a lot of conversation about that,

[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.460]
and there's no question that that's true,

[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.860]
but that isn't a reason he got fired.

[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:02.620]
Another way-

[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:02.620]

[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.680]
Look, I could-

[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.780]
If I wanted to be really vicious, which I wasn't,

[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.100]
because, uh, that would only play into his hand,

[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.940]
but if I wanted to really lay it on the line,

[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.460]
there are dozens of things that he did.

[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:12.820]
Yeah.

[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.440]
Like, uh, like the time that Stan and I wanted to kind of resurrect

[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.020]
our little thing at the ice cream store,

[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.840]
and all of a sudden he comes up with his talk-

[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.180]
and he started doing this repeatedly when we-

[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.140]
every time we had a remote or no matter what it was,

[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.540]
he had some excuse that he would fabricate,

[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.360]
so he's not to go along with the game plan,

[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.440]
and all along he was gonna be up and groward anyway,

[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.220]
so he set up this deal with his real estate person.

[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.580]
Now, he did that after we had already set the date up

[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.780]
to do this appearance, you know,

[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:36.960]
and I- I just got sick of that.

[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.340]
I mean, that was one of many things.

[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.860]
Here, he was getting basically a free ride here,

[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.560]
and yet, anytime we expected him or asked him to do anything-

[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.020]
I- I got important stuff to do, okay?

[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.160]
They can't wait for another day.

[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.760]
I mean, there are dozens of reasons

[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.720]
that I just got fed up with his entire attitude.

[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:51.380]
It's suck.

[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.680]
You know, attitude sucks.

[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.760]
And the idea that he comes barging in here

[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.500]
two months after he got his ass cam

[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.480]
as if a world might have started a story,

[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.160]
and you got a watch side, you're fired,

[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.840]
you're stunk, you're a pain in the ass,

[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:02.760]
I got tired of you.

[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.240]
You're gone, that's it.

[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.460]
Grow up and accept it.

[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.820]
You know, he can't do that, even now he can't accept it.

[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.320]
I'm sure it.

[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.760]
Now that Steve Kane is gone,

[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.660]
can I play amateur psychologists here?

[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.300]
Oh, sure.

[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.160]
Yeah, we need-

[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.580]
we have a void here in our lineup, we need to do that.

[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.620]
You know what word pops into my mind about Glant After In Great?

[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.000]
Immaturity.

[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:20.720]
Yeah.

[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.740]
I'm listening to four hours of the QSR,

[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.420]
and I'm glad you laid back a little yesterday

[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.660]
and let him give them to explain that.

[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.380]
This guy won't admit anything.

[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.200]
Despite your repeated conversations with him over the months,

[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.900]
he would not adjust his behavior.

[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.000]
It's just evident to me that the job wasn't that important to him.

[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.900]
You know, when I finally started screaming at him,

[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.080]
he said, well, I can't do that on my own person.

[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.320]
I said, five, then there's the reason you can't do that.

[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.460]
That's why you can't be on the show.

[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.400]
Oh, is if all of a sudden it's clarified for him, you know?

[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.220]
Yeah, one last thing, Nail.

[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.780]
I thought also he was sucking around for his job yesterday

[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.080]
because I mean, it's obvious he's not a talent

[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.360]
because he didn't get picked up right away after he got fired.

[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.040]
And I, you know, I don't know whether or not he is going to get hired by me.

[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.960]
You see, but this reveals, and this is the thing that frightens me,

[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.080]
this reveals that he really in his own mind thinks that he could go on

[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.080]
like one of his sick offense calls it,

[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.840]
oh, yeah, it would be great if NWS puts you on right off his knee,

[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:12.600]
it'll tend to two.

[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.680]
And then, you know, then it would really have something.

[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.700]
He believes that.

[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.500]
He believes he can go on and do a four-hour talk show every day

[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.340]
and carry it.

[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.760]
And the fact is that, you know, the last time I was in vacation,

[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.160]
most people said he did a good job,

[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.540]
but that was out of the ordinary.

[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.220]
In fact, the time before that he had filled in,

[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.340]
he had embarrassed himself so much that,

[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.140]
in fact, that's how Alex spent it gone here.

[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:32.400]
Yeah.

[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.860]
Okay, if it weren't for the bad job he did filling in the previous time,

[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.520]
Alex would never have been in his building.

[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.220]
Yeah.

[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.280]
Faced with Alex, he was in a little gratitude there too.

[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.140]
Well, Nail, I hate to say it, but I'm enjoying all this.

[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.080]
Well, of course, that's what this market's all about.

[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.400]
Okay, I have a great thing now, too.

[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.640]
Everybody loves a lot of bickering and hate, et cetera.

[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.200]
What are you looking at the food like?

[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.280]
What is that?

[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.820]
I think Kotobi is bringing food from the toast today.

[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:57.620]
I think that's the rumor.

[00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.700]
What are you looking for?

[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.740]
Nail, then, what the hell?

[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.500]
Who dropped the cart, standard?

[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.540]
Well, tell him to get off his lazy ass and go back there and find it

[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.900]
and don't the metal around with his show.

[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.700]
Tell him to get off this show, okay?

[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.840]
We're doing a radio show here.

[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.760]
We're not playing stand-made, you're lost and found.

[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.420]
God, anybody would do a poll and have his audience vote

[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.280]
for Terry Miriamon over his self-ornanda is that of a shame.

[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.620]
I think Stan Rigged it.

[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.340]
He doesn't like to admit it, but he's still back into that Philadelphia thing

[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.780]
with Terry Miriamon and all those Philadelphia Twinkies.

[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.100]
W-I-O-D, hello.

[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:29.780]
Hi, Nail, how are you?

[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.540]
Okay, hold on a second.

[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.700]
What card are you looking for?

[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.120]
He dropped Enbow.

[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.520]
What the hell are you playing, my cart?

[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.520]
You slimeball, Enbow's right there.

[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:40.900]
Anchor with a whip?

[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.320]
Get out of here, Stan.

[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.420]
Go get some material, will you?

[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.240]
Okay, let's, how could that be Tamarack?

[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.080]
I just put, well, listen, it's old Bizarre now.

[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.540]
We might as well put you on right now, right?

[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:50.100]
Hi.

[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.500]
I hit up all these other people.

[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.040]
Why not?

[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.700]
I think I've said about it too.

[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:54.380]
You're a good man.

[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.840]
I just called up 976 Rose because you said it was a good thing to do.

[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:58.880]
It is, they're beautiful.

[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.660]
Well, I'm having a dozen, I'm having a dozen cents a year for her.

[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.000]
My wife's pregnant and it's her birthday.

[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.240]
What a way to sell it.

[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.040]
What a way to sell it.

[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:06.040]

[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.940]
Have two dozen cents.

[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.080]
Have two dozen.

[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:10.500]
Sure.

[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.180]
Send the bill your phone.

[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.260]
Okay, have fun.

[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.980]
They got all the money in the world.

[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.800]
I was driving home last night from my health club listening to Stan on the radio,

[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.960]
talking about, you know, that thing with, you know, the other one, Maryman.

[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:23.420]
Mm-hmm.

[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.980]
I couldn't figure out why he was doing it.

[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.100]
I mean, was he a nut-n-n-elce to do?

[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.180]
Not, were you in a spare-pickin'-on-stand?

[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.260]
No, I like Stan.

[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:31.200]
I call him old.

[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.780]
Well, he does have nothing else to do.

[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.420]
It's a good time.

[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.360]
Color-time, Stan is one of the great time colors in a history of the business

[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.680]
and it's a good way to kill some time.

[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.880]
He also says he's not going to be on it too long.

[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.760]
He must not have too much confidence in it.

[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.220]
Well, first of all, let me say this.

[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.280]
He has accepted to do it as a temporary thing.

[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:47.660]
Okay.

[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.460]
But why he continues to dwell on that on the air?

[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.440]
I don't know.

[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.560]
I'm telling him every day, cut the crap, cut the crap.

[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:55.860]
I know.

[00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.760]
Just go in and do it, sit there during the ballgame, have a free meal, relax, you know.

[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.840]
And he just is compel.

[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.180]
I don't know what the hell is stories.

[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.940]
Can I change the subject first?

[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:06.860]
Maybe it's hard, though.

[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.520]
He worked with Glenn for a while.

[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.420]
Maybe you're a rough dog.

[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:10.840]
What about baseball?

[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.900]
Are we not going to have baseball down here this year?

[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.060]
Well, not there any time soon, I don't think.

[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.300]
Oh, what a bummer.

[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:16.680]
I know.

[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.420]
Can you do it, then?

[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.280]
Oh, well, let's keep what thing is for us.

[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.460]
Maybe there was nothing, you know.

[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.000]
Let's hope.

[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.540]
Listen, I enjoyed your show yesterday with the bird.

[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:26.820]
I thought you were a real man.

[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.760]
You handled it accordingly.

[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.820]
You got everything pretty much straight now.

[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.660]
A real man, well.

[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.340]
Well, you could have really never said that.

[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.440]
You know, but you're a nice guy, you know.

[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:34.740]
Sure.

[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.720]
Anyway, I get back to work.

[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.140]
Good luck.

[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:37.760]
Appreciate it.

[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.420]
Boy, they're really sucking around this morning.

[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.700]
1044 at WID.

[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.000]
How about those maple leaves, man?

[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:43.680]
Watch that game.

[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.920]
I said they kicked their crap out of San Luis 7-1.

[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.940]
Alan Vester actually played a good game in gold.

[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.920]
And Ali Afredi was going nuts.

[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.580]
And the blue France is getting.

[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.260]
It was just a grind on.

[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:55.500]
Nobody cares anymore about hockey.

[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.900]
But I just happen to watch it.

[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.360]
It was great.

[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.820]
And Toronto's only two points out of first place

[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:00.560]
in the North Division.

[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.440]
Who can believe that?

[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.900]
Let's bring the bird back and talk hockey.

[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:04.380]
OK?

[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:05.760]
Sunrise.

[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:06.860]
Neil, how you doing?

[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:07.220]
Great.

[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.200]
A couple of comments.

[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.600]
That sounds like a real good idea though.

[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.020]
Bring them back to talk about hockey.

[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.320]
Yeah, well, you use his head as the puck.

[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.900]
I just have one word for yesterday.

[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:16.940]
Not for the show.

[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:17.660]
The show was great.

[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.260]
But the key word for yesterday, I think, is just pathetic.

[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.580]
That's the word that keeps rolling around in my head.

[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:22.840]
I know.

[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.340]
You met it.

[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.320]
You met it in that word.

[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:24.940]
Oh, pathetic.

[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.300]
It's just a tragic.

[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:31.220]
And to talk about the great deal, but anyway, he.

[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:35.420]
He was calling around sports talk shows for years now.

[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.220]
He used to call it Chaplin, then.

[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.420]
I think Bill is the first non-sports talk show that he's called.

[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.220]
Yeah, I never heard of him before until I heard him on Bill's show one day ago.

[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:44.340]
Yeah.

[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.640]
And then all of a sudden, he started just like multiplying.

[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.760]
I think we have about a half a dozen Gilbert's arc there.

[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:55.360]
But the point you bring out during the series, kind of serious, about Gilbert and that fine line, you know?

[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:55.680]
Yeah.

[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.200]
It's like when you laugh at him, it's like half of it's because he's got a lot of fun.

[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.620]
And you know, maybe like the other half because you're like, you know, you're making fun of him.

[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.180]
You know what I mean?

[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:08.680]
No.

[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.000]
Well, it's like, you know, I'm not making fun of him.

[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.420]
No, no, no, I'm not saying you.

[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.140]
I find him funny and I find him amusing because he's got a good.

[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:19.440]
He knows that he's a little different and he knows that he's bizarre and he's funny.

[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.320]
And he's having a great time with it.

[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:26.240]
But I don't think he knows when he's being exploited and where people are just making fun of him.

[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.960]
And that's what happened here yesterday afternoon.

[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.640]
I don't give it in with anybody says or anybody denies it.

[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.060]
I heard it. I heard a lot of it.

[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:32.280]
Yeah.

[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:33.600]
I heard I cringed.

[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.200]
I really cringed because a lot of the callers and also the comedian who thought she was so funny.

[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.000]
She was about as funny as a wet dish right.

[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:39.860]
She had nothing to say.

[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.540]
And then basically it turned into the Gilbert show again because she offered nuts.

[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.580]
She had nothing to the show.

[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.900]
Yeah, they got pretty lame towards the end.

[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.880]
Alex kept asking to, I think, repeat the number for a neutral system.

[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.720]
And he kept the one, and he said that's pretty original.

[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.300]
Yeah, it was pretty lame.

[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.080]
Alex, why does that have to go on?

[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.040]
And why can't these guys do in their own thing?

[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.700]
Here's a guy who's been in the business for many, many years.

[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.060]
He's worked in New York in San Francisco all over the country.

[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:09.700]
What is it in his disease that these people catch when they come here that anything that they hear, especially on this show,

[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.340]
but not exclusive on this show, all of a sudden they all start doing it.

[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.000]
I don't get it.

[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.400]
I just don't get it.

[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.300]
I don't get it either.

[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.320]
I even, you know, Alex lost a lot of credibility yesterday when he did that to me.

[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.520]
Well, maybe if he finds his, whatever the hell he's looking for.

[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:25.400]
If he gets laid, I guess.

[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.420]
Oh, now you see, we decided we can't say that anymore.

[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:31.840]
He's cake, which is really, and that all these guys go, oh, yo, you're hoping it's Jerry, cheese, cake.

[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:33.700]
Oh, is that it?

[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.680]
Oh, it's getting like sandbox time.

[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.640]
Here are the sandbox at the oldies.

[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.400]
I'm sure glad I got these CFLM like who jingles card it up.

[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.140]
I'm like who?

[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.760]
I'm the people in the audience don't even remember WMYQ.

[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:52.960]
They haven't been here long enough.

[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.560]
153, a WMYD Roger just handed me a bullet in here.

[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:58.680]
Oh, it's just true.

[00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.580]
We're not making this up.

[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.060]
A buffalo in New York man was awarded $450,000.

[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:10.400]
After surgeons amputated his penis in the erroneous belief that it was cancerous.

[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.200]
Okay, seven to eleven.

[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.600]
Let's go to a lady from Miami.

[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:23.300]
Hello.

[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:23.900]
I knew.

[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.180]
The pool is cut of all, yeah.

[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.380]
The remote and the grove was your very best entertainment.

[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.600]
We had a great time there.

[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.740]
I think Gilbert helped all the shows that were trying to go on stale.

[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.620]
So don't feel sorry for the time.

[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.520]
Wait a minute, are you going stale?

[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.580]
Sort of, come on now.

[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.460]
It's serious.

[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.640]
He's a clever guy.

[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:42.740]

[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.800]
It's only the audience that gets to.

[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.400]
It's your opinion, kiddo.

[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:46.820]
Yeah.

[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.680]
You've got a lot of quiet, anyway.

[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:49.660]
We love him.

[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.420]
Yeah, but that's not the point.

[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.360]
I'm not knocking Gilbert.

[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.380]
The point is that there are people who are, it's overdone.

[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:56.600]
No, not really.

[00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:57.880]
No, Alex's phone.

[00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.920]
Alex's show was a lot of fun.

[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:00.660]
You're crazy.

[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:01.660]
You're dreaming.

[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.040]
Now Gilbert can know, Jimmy, that's where you're dreaming.

[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:05.440]
Yeah.

[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.840]
He knows what he's doing.

[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.960]
Don't worry about him.

[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:08.960]
Yeah, okay.

[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.020]
Yeah, we love him.

[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:10.580]
Yeah, okay.

[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:12.540]
Pathetic.

[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:14.780]
1054 at WIOG.

[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:15.560]
Dear Field B.

[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:15.940]
Hello.

[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:16.880]
Hello, Neil.

[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.560]
Hi, first time caller.

[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.420]
I took a lot of nerve finally call you.

[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:21.440]
How's that?

[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:22.040]
Are you in trouble?

[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.160]
Well, I listen to you a lot, and I know you put people down if you think they get boring.

[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:27.880]
But I'll try not to be.

[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.680]
I'm from Central New York, like you.

[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.960]
And I was a big fan.

[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:32.600]
It's burning down.

[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:33.220]
Finger Lakes.

[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.860]
And now I'm at Golfstream in Palpat, Iowa.

[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:35.280]
Great.

[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.740]
So I have a lot of...

[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.540]
Hold on, hold on once.

[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:37.840]
Yeah.

[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.280]
WIOG.

[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:39.580]
Hello.

[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:40.500]
Hello.

[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:41.400]
Dear Field B.

[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:41.840]
Neil, register.

[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:42.800]
One moment please.

[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:44.900]
Where was this guy?

[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.040]
Oh, in Dear Field, right?

[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:46.660]
I'm at Dear Field.

[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:47.440]
Hold on a second.

[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:48.480]
WIOG.

[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.500]
Good morning, Arthur Modell.

[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.500]
Would like to speak with the O'Rager's concerning football.

[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:54.540]
Yeah, right.

[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:55.540]
Hello.

[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.240]
I'm still here.

[00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.160]
Yeah, I'm going to give Art Modeel some pointers.

[00:27:59.320 --> 00:27:59.800]
Get rid of Bernie.

[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.580]
Okay, any quarterback that plays side-sale can't be all good.

[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:03.600]
Definitely.

[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.780]
Hold on one second, sir.

[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:05.760]
WIOG.

[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.640]
The line checker.

[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.400]
Okay, it was just a line checker.

[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:09.840]
Are you done checking lines?

[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:10.160]
Yeah.

[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:10.740]
Okay.

[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.540]
I don't know.

[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.400]
A couple of browners that aren't there lit, so, you know, be prepared.

[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.420]
You're going to be, it's adding something to your call.

[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.000]
Okay.

[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:17.540]
Hold on.

[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:18.620]
WIOG.

[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.300]
What the hell do you want?

[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.100]
Hold on.

[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:23.880]
I'll tell you in a second.

[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:24.840]
WIOG.

[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.240]
I don't think it was just because I could hear it.

[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.560]
Does Neil Carey speak with me?

[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:29.240]
Goodbye.

[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:30.920]
Yes, sir.

[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:31.700]
Bill?

[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:32.100]
Yeah.

[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:32.620]
Okay.

[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:39.020]
Well, the reason I finally got tipped off enough to call because of yesterday's show about the bird.

[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:42.980]
And after seeing him on TV last night and what he looks like, and I know what he found out.

[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:43.520]
Hold on one second.

[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:44.900]
WIOG.

[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.280]
Oh, glacial jingle.

[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:47.220]
Hold on a minute.

[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:47.680]
We'll do it.

[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.040]
Hey, yeah.

[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:48.300]
Okay.

[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.200]
Now they're all full, so you don't have to anything to worry about.

[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.220]
You got to hear sailing.

[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:51.760]
Terrific.

[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:52.300]
Okay.

[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.100]
Well, like I said, we have a lot in common, but the thing I call about is bird.

[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.360]
And I was with Armed Forces Radio and TV.

[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:03.880]
And this guy couldn't get an audition or pants the audition at AFN in Europe or any AFRTF.

[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.340]
He doesn't have an ad goods.

[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:05.860]
Wait a minute.

[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.260]
How do you spell out AFRTF?

[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.760]
Armed Forces Radio and Television.

[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.440]
Can we spell it on the air?

[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.340]
Yeah, you can just spell it off.

[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.220]
It could be far to you.

[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.280]
I don't see.

[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.720]
That's the difference.

[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.400]
I spelled it.

[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.440]
It was a little subtle.

[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.440]
And you come out and you blurt out far.

[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.020]
Well, I don't know.

[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.160]
It's just like an awful, it's terrible.

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.600]
Right.

[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.460]
And I'm horrible.

[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.300]
Oh, no, it's not.

[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.820]
I've heard you said a lot.

[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.660]
Well, I don't care.

[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.340]
That's not the point, but there's a subtle way to do so.

[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:36.580]
Right.

[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.700]
And then there's a crash.

[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.160]
Well, it's like Joey.

[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.840]
It's like a elephant in a Chinese shop.

[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.700]
You have to do things very subtly.

[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.840]
Well, no.

[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:46.660]
Yeah, all right.

[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:47.400]
Hold on a second.

[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:48.220]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.340]
We want Gilbert.

[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.200]
Hold on a minute.

[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.100]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:52.380]
Jingle.

[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.340]
All right.

[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:54.900]
Well, another showing up on other lines.

[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:55.400]
What is it?

[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:55.880]
Okay.

[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:56.920]
One other thing.

[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.360]
Oh, look at this.

[00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.460]
Slim Rich is here.

[00:29:59.520 --> 00:29:59.800]
Look at that.

[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.920]
He put a smaller shirt on.

[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.380]
They look like he lost 20 pounds.

[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:03.900]
Well, that's great.

[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.500]
I needed this is my last cigar.

[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.600]
Boy, you must be psychic.

[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.420]
A fat rich probably some cigar, sir.

[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.960]
Hey, you don't care.

[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:11.580]
You don't care.

[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.220]
Am I on?

[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:12.660]
Yeah.

[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:13.200]
Oh, good.

[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.280]
I'm talking to you.

[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.660]
I'm having a little arachnid.

[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.180]
I'm talking about six people at one.

[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.720]
Well, of course, that's what this is.

[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.680]
It's like a little circus.

[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.620]
You can relate to it.

[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.860]
I got a question.

[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.940]
You know that with the announcer at golf stream, Ross Martin.

[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.660]
From finger lakes.

[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:26.300]
Exactly.

[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.180]
I ought to go back.

[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:27.740]
Exactly.

[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.100]
Night's voice, the kid.

[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.000]
Oh, we're doing it.

[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:30.800]
No, no.

[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.280]
Sometimes you don't even know what rates are.

[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.660]
Constipated sound.

[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.640]
You got to watch the TV to find out what's going on.

[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.400]
Why can't we invite Tom Durkin to come down for the rest of the golf stream?

[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:38.840]
I don't know.

[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.220]
The Don family is just enchanted with Ross Morton.

[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.640]
I have no idea what that's all about.

[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.160]
Yeah, good voice, but can't speak.

[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.820]
No, I can't speak.

[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:46.860]
Speak, or speak.

[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:47.900]
Marbles in his mouth.

[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:48.700]
He's the worst.

[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.320]
A little disappointed with Alex.

[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.820]
I thought he was going to be good, but I thought he was a great one.

[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:54.500]
Oh, great.

[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.960]
Are we going to start with Alex?

[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:56.740]
No, I said go ahead and hit him.

[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:57.380]
No, no, no.

[00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:58.300]
I like Alex.

[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:00.800]
But yesterday he must have been hard up for material.

[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.320]
That woman.

[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.420]
That woman had just called to use so full of crap.

[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:09.060]
That is the most outrageous call for anybody to say that they didn't exploit and mock you.

[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:09.720]
Oh, it was pathetic.

[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.200]
Gilbert was pathetic.

[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.040]
He's harder for materials.

[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.140]
He's got to pick on Gilbert.

[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.380]
He'll have to play.

[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.380]
How come between Tuesday and Wednesday there was this tremendous turn around?

[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.400]
On Tuesday, everybody, according to Alex, everybody was Gilbert did out.

[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.340]
It was getting ridiculous.

[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:22.620]
Right.

[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.420]
No, it was good last of the, he's in here for the entire show.

[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:31.640]
I mean, Alex is the one who wants to know how, but he really had too much fun at Gilbert's expense.

[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:32.160]
Exactly.

[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.160]
One item on his family.

[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:34.800]

[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.020]
Let's send the Buffalo for another one of the fancy things.

[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:41.080]
Hey, he's taking a Buffalo, my roommate from Buffalo, and he knows Buffalo wings like nobody.

[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:41.980]
Well, that's great.

[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.800]
Stand majors should stick to topics.

[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.300]
He's very good with topics.

[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:51.660]
But the minute he tries, the minute he tries to do your job.

[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.640]
Start playing my cards.

[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:53.680]
He tries to play you.

[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:54.380]
Get your own cards.

[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:54.880]
Stand up.

[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.360]
That's a crap.

[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.080]
It doesn't work.

[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.900]
He cannot add lip for four hours.

[00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:58.640]
It was his own thing.

[00:31:58.860 --> 00:31:58.980]
Okay.

[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.800]
It was a Twinkie show every night.

[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:01.640]
Exactly.

[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.720]
That's a crap already.

[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.280]
Well, listen, you've been quite a caller, sir.

[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.540]
Well, maybe I'll see you at, not if I know what you look like, and I go to gallstream.

[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.900]
Maybe I'll stop and have a beer.

[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:11.700]
No chance.

[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.380]
Now the chance.

[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:12.940]
Have a good time.

[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:13.800]
I hope you win a lot of money.

[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.220]
Well, you'd like my roommate, too, so I don't know.

[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:16.540]
Great.

[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.560]
Have a lot of, like I said, we'll be looking for you.

[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:18.920]
Bye.

[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:19.460]
See you.

[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.440]
Well, listen, that's the end of a very amazing first hour.

[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.280]
We've got good old Henry Barrow standing by.

[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.320]
Henry's Neil Rogers.

[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.480]
Our new SOG Radio 610 WIOB.

[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.840]
You know, we live in real life.

[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.260]
Let's be in a little good.

[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.680]
But we don't drink or drink.

[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.140]
No, we just need a blow.

[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.760]
They take me to the stage.

[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.680]
Okay, it's 11.05 at WIOB.

[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.580]
Well, I can't remember those.

[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.420]
Those would be real good for going into a record.

[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.960]
I was going to play a record for the bird.

[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:48.700]
Bell on.

[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:49.780]
Bell on.

[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:50.400]
Bell on.

[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.060]
Bell on.

[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:51.960]
Bell on.

[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:52.420]
Bell on.

[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.160]
Bell on.

[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:53.880]
Bell on.

[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.480]
Bell on.

[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.320]
Come on, yes.

[00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:58.900]
Yes, sir.

[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.160]
Am I.

[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.140]
Is this Neil Rogers?

[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:02.660]
Yes.

[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.960]
Am I on now?

[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.180]
Because the other day I was following.

[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:08.940]
I was following.

[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.400]
Nobody told me how long it would have taken to me beating.

[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.160]
Well, you run right now.

[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.020]
You're rather than wasting all these.

[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:14.300]

[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.000]
lunges hear it?

[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.180]
You're arresting the ancient past.

[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:24.160]
A year ago, I told the station.

[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:24.660]
Yeah.

[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:31.360]
And I, I, I, I complained that the bird was, was nothing more than a laughing hyena.

[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.860]
And I, I just assumed that the station was just visible.

[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.300]
But listen to this now.

[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:44.040]
I was told specifically that management felt that this was a good combination.

[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:45.820]
Period.

[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.760]
They want me to, what do you expect them to tell you?

[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.140]
Well, what do they expect?

[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.840]
You expect them to say, well, we're right.

[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:52.800]
No, no, no, no, no.

[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.080]
Wait a minute.

[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.340]
You're expecting to say, yeah, you're right and he'll be gone tomorrow because you're

[00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:56.700]
called.

[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.520]
But wait a minute.

[00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:57.940]
Wait a minute.

[00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:59.040]
No, of course not.

[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.500]
There's just one, one little nail in the coffin.

[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:07.720]
But the other thing is, aren't you responsible for the people who are with you if it's your

[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.020]
show?

[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:08.440]
Yes.

[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.640]
That's why he's gone.

[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.880]
Well, how come you've been getting a bit of melat sooner?

[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:16.300]
Because I'm a, a, a fool because I'm a soft-hearted slum, sir.

[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:17.840]
I'm a jerk.

[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.680]
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a,

[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:31.560]
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm

[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:31.560]

[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.360]
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm

[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:52.660]
a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm

[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:21.740]
a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm

[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:51.240]
a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a

[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:56.800]
isn't that a real interesting lesson with the audience. Isn't that a real interesting lesson with the audience. Did we never give the numbers?

[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:04.160]
Did we never give the numbers once. We never gave the numbers once. We never gave the numbers once. We never gave that the number once. I've half-rolled wages give them element at one time, LOVE.

[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.620]
I don't know.

[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:21.220]

[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.540]
Okay, well think about it for a while, call us back.

[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.740]
Craig, Craig got five ladies in gentlemen.

[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.820]
Okay, it's nine minutes after, WYOD, hello.

[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.000]
Okay, line checker, write these down now,

[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.700]
because that's gonna be the next IOD contest.

[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.680]
You're gonna have to do a track, all of these calls.

[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.480]
And whoever gets the first 4,000, right?

[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:39.340]
WYOD.

[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.920]
Hi, can I talk to Neil?

[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:41.660]
Sure, hold on, please.

[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:42.820]
WYOD.

[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:43.460]
Neil.

[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:45.840]
Yes, hold on a second.

[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:46.700]
WYOD.

[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.480]
Line checker, yes.

[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.540]
Now we're gonna for, by the way, hold on.

[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:51.360]
WYOD.

[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.960]
Line checker again, for, yes.

[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:54.760]
Neil.

[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.100]
Yeah, hold on a second.

[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:56.920]
WYOD.

[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:01.420]
Hello.

[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.480]
Okay, put them on hold.

[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.620]
Okay, this is other guys gonna go nuts, aren't you, sir?

[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:06.300]
Yes, Neil.

[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.200]
You can't stand it.

[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.000]
I know, Neil.

[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.320]
And a while back, remember when Irene Richards called.

[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.680]
The burn, and she's not in.

[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:13.960]
You know, we're in a...

[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.540]
Which time?

[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.240]
Irene called many times.

[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:16.420]
Well.

[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.620]
Many times to unleash her anger and fury.

[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:25.020]
And a couple days later, I called after, and I started ripping her bird.

[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.600]
And I don't know what happened to you, but you started defending him, and you then...

[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.300]
Well, what did you mean?

[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:30.800]
Wait a minute.

[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:31.220]
Wait a minute.

[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.360]
Was that after or before he was gone?

[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.840]
That was before he was gone.

[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:42.100]
Well, of course, if he's still here on the show, I'm not gonna orchestrate a crucifixion on

[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:42.540]
the air.

[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.280]
You crucified me that day.

[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:45.300]
Well, you deserved it.

[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.300]
I probably did.

[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:46.960]
And...

[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:47.980]
And the anonymity's gone.

[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:48.780]
What do you want to say?

[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:49.700]
Uh-huh.

[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.580]
Well, now that he's gone, what do you want to say?

[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:52.820]
He's not even hiding in the newsboard.

[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.220]
Let's rip him a good ass.

[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.160]
Okay, he deserves it.

[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:55.700]
He's pathetic.

[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.560]
It's true, and especially after everything he said yesterday about you, and here you were trying

[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.060]
to defend him, and I was trying to rip his ass.

[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.400]
And there's a lot of crap about how loyal he was, man.

[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:09.660]
Every time I was out of this room, even if I went to the John, I'd come back up and I'm

[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.060]
a hallway speaker right here.

[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.020]
Oh, boy!

[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.060]
And I would never call except when he...

[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.440]
And he would suck it up, man.

[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.260]
He loved it.

[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.420]
He loved it.

[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:18.880]
Is he going to be working anywhere?

[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.040]
Do you have you heard any rumors?

[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.720]
Are you kidding me?

[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.420]
Although I understand they're hiring over at publics.

[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:26.880]
Oh, okay.

[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.580]
Yeah, he's going to be pushing the little cart.

[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.280]
Couldn't be.

[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.420]
Behind Dicky Farkel.

[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:30.920]
Maybe.

[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.040]
Okay, well, Neil, thank you.

[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.200]
Farkel will be on the aisle on the extreme right.

[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:36.700]
Ah, I guess.

[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:37.460]
Good luck to you, sir.

[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.020]
It's 11 after 11 at the WID.

[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:43.160]
The audience is vicious and nasty and brutal today, just the way we like it.

[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.660]
Well, we do have an open line in Palm Beach.

[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.480]
I just mentioned that.

[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.680]
I don't really feel like right now.

[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:48.920]
I felt great this morning.

[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:49.620]
I came in.

[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.440]
I felt marvelous.

[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.260]
And now a little headache.

[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.640]
Maybe it's the six cigars I smoked before I came.

[00:38:54.780 --> 00:39:00.280]
It's not cigars in the morning, just after the first dozen or so it starts to get to you.

[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:00.980]
WID.

[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:01.760]
Yes.

[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:02.820]
Hold on, please.

[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:03.880]
Okay?

[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:04.300]
Yes.

[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.020]
Thank you.

[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.760]
The problem is that after 11 used cars, boy...

[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.680]
Well, let's see.

[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:10.260]
We can play it.

[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.440]
First, it gets down underneath.

[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.160]
Well, the console really plays.

[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.820]
Call that wrong and turn free back then.

[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.880]
Send the facts, send the facts, send the facts.

[00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:32.660]
If you are a six, eight or so, it starts to be quieter.

[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.400]
If you raise a bell, give a call to John Paul.

[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.940]
Under the banner, get white.

[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:49.740]
While your drugs are hell like hot, and you yell, yes, I quit monsoon, I'll be your wild and true star rockin' rollin' you.

[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.980]
With the sisters, I can call you.

[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:58.960]
Don't you ask, don't you ask, like, oh, three, you like him, now the mark goes to four, six, eight.

[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.260]
Dunshouting don't hesitate.

[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.880]
Tell me, oh, now, I'm light or wrong.

[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.320]
We'll make sure, drop me a home.

[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.900]
John Paul gets mad, well, some old fun.

[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.040]
Well, the dope put the Pope on the rope.

[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.560]
Don't you wait for the rescue.

[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.100]
Don't feel like picking up your doubts.

[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.340]
Don't send a century inside a minute, century.

[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.840]
Do the remaining, and I do the adding hand.

[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.900]
Just tell me, I'll be a living kid.

[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.980]
Anyway, Sunday on Facelation, a gullbid one.

[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:29.220]
Guesting?

[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.740]
What is her name that does the face of the nation?

[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:37.980]
Leslie Stahl from CBS will be interviewing Gilbert, discussing democracy in the Eastern Block Nations.

[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.000]
It's gonna be incredible.

[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.320]
Okay, Boken Palm Beach, you're both open.

[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.100]
We just mentioned that.

[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:46.260]
I would be glad to tell you what the time was, but, well, it's 5133.

[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.260]
That's what it says here.

[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:48.540]
What, what, what happened there?

[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.720]
All of a sudden, not a nowhere.

[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.960]
A clock on a wall, and a clock on the thing here.

[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.100]
They just all went nuts.

[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.180]
Dear Field.

[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:55.820]
Dear Field.

[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:56.540]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.220]
Hey, you doing this?

[00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:58.960]
It's who?

[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:00.300]
Call me from public.

[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.600]
Yeah, tell me what's up.

[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.180]
Hold on a sec, I don't have a phone.

[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:03.740]
Okay.

[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.480]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.180]
Whoop, sorry, wrong number.

[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:07.600]
Okay.

[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.040]
The bulk align, by the way, when you press the button down here, it sticks.

[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:17.240]
So not only do we have a problem on the line, but also when the physical thing there, it's through the end of the line.

[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:18.180]
Palm Beach.

[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:19.940]
Palm Beach, mobile.

[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:20.680]
Yeah.

[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:21.740]
Deal.

[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:22.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.580]
I just want to judge you something.

[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.400]
I've been listening to you for a long time.

[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:27.640]
Hold on a second.

[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.660]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:30.360]
Hello?

[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.220]
Okay, it was a line checker on Bokeh.

[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:33.620]
Go ahead.

[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.300]
I just wanted to judge you something.

[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:38.840]
Since you got rid of that parasite, that's the only word I can use for a...

[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.200]
Reming.

[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:40.120]
Huh?

[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:40.840]
Reming.

[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.120]
Well, I said what I said.

[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.240]
You said it was you said...

[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:44.840]
Melonhead.

[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:45.960]
Whatever.

[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.660]
And you should have known it...

[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:52.640]
You should have known it when you were in Chicago, because you've shown that you did from there by yourself with...

[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.520]
with so fantastic.

[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.700]
Because at that time, I finally realized what it was.

[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.400]
That asshole was not here with...

[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:01.940]
Did you... did you hear that alibi he gave yesterday about why he didn't go up there?

[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.280]
Now, that was the lamest excuse.

[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:04.860]
Be well.

[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:08.000]
He knew all we talked about was the Cubs, and he wasn't going to be a...

[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.400]
Like, he could pick and choose his spots.

[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:10.900]
Okay?

[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:16.960]
In other words, if it wasn't something that he was interested in, he wasn't going to be bothered, you know, like with a free trip to Chicago.

[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:21.180]
And we stayed in the Ritz Carlton, which to me is one of the finest hotels in the world.

[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.360]
You almost got killed, didn't you?

[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.880]
Well, that's another story, but I mean, the food was fabulous.

[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.780]
He didn't have to go to the ball games.

[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:32.240]
There were a lot of people along any after-wise who went through on way like Melvin who went out and got bombed and had a good time.

[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:33.220]
Melvin did that?

[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.820]
Oh, Melvin had a great time up there. He didn't want to come back.

[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.120]
I also remember my telling the story every morning.

[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:42.700]
We'd get up and go out to breakfast at 7.30. He'd be just coming in from the night before.

[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.480]
I realized that when I was listening to you, you had a young girl over there.

[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.680]
She started a lap and she started with much better than him. That's when Harry Carrey came in.

[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.780]
Oh, yeah. That was...

[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:53.820]
Dork Lady Jr. That was the...

[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:54.820]
I don't know. Who was great?

[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.300]
And I said, what the hell did he need that cashing asshole?

[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:57.980]
No, exactly.

[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.700]
All right. You're doing great. Just keep it up there.

[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.680]
We wish him all the best in the world. In fact, maybe, you know, now that they have these sun,

[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.960]
what do they call those things where they get electricity from... You know what I'm talking about?

[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:08.360]
Oh, solar.

[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:11.360]
So, yeah, they can use his head as a solar energy source.

[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.440]
Well, maybe he could be a taxi driver in Miami. Only he speaks English.

[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.800]
Okay. Good luck to you, sir.

[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:19.520]
Yeah, I think it would be good. We could put him like out right between the station in Channel 7

[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.640]
and just point his head at the sun.

[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:25.360]
And we could probably run both transmitters for us in GTR.

[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:30.100]
By the way, Spike Wise looks spiffy this morning. He was downstairs with his cowboy hat

[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.900]
and his skirt kickin' outfit. He's got a chorus off to Atlanta.

[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:39.100]
And those two, I just can't believe it because WXIA and Atlanta

[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:43.060]
were some of us do see on a satellite, F-12, by the way.

[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:47.640]
But anyway, they run a lot of spots for that... It's F-M-106 and 104.

[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.440]
It's the only SimalCast F-M, I think, in the country.

[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:54.380]
And there are different sides of the city. You must have a big signal.

[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:58.900]
If they have the ZybelCast. And it's old countries.

[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.660]
A country Y's is gonna be up there and who are we sure wish him the best.

[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:05.420]
And hope that he does well enough that he never has to come back.

[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.300]
Oh my God, where the hell have you been?

[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.820]
Where's the Donnie Osmond pictures?

[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.180]
Why? All right, Melvin, go in and get the story.

[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:23.620]
All we got is a picture of Fat Rich feeding his face at the specs.

[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.440]
What happened?

[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.080]
Where are those under... Oh, you didn't take the Donnie.

[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.900]
I look through the window. You look like George. Oh, no.

[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.980]
One of you looked perplexed. Oh, look at that. There I am with one of those cigars.

[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.520]
There's no wonder I'm getting a little out of the weather. I'm... I'm chain smoking cigars.

[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.820]
And there's another one where I'm giving the Dictaphyrola salute. That looks good.

[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.980]
Or why are you giving these to me one at a time? Is there a special reason for that?

[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.300]
It's something with a mind of some of your... Oh, I see.

[00:44:55.820 --> 00:45:00.060]
Well, now look at that. I look about a spay and that picture is spay-way and that is darling.

[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:04.760]
What kind of a picture is that? It looks like a scene out of Lakaja Full or something.

[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.640]
And I don't want that one, okay?

[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.700]
I don't want my dogs to see that they leave home.

[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:16.800]
God, that is the fiest picture I have ever taken in my life.

[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.860]
Well, listen to Macho either. Well, that's a guard.

[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.880]
I'm holding it like... It could be something else, you know.

[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:27.080]
That's pretty good. Now, this is a good one here. This is a good picture.

[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.880]
Excellent. Are these mine?

[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.620]
There's one that you're going to be with. It's my only picture.

[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.580]
Well, what about this? Can I have this one?

[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.580]
And I'll give you these other limperasted ones here to take back.

[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.340]
Thank you very much. What a gentleman.

[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.540]
Or I thought, no, I looked through there and you can't always see the lighting isn't good.

[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:46.080]
And I thought it was George and I said, we're those darling ozman pictures.

[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:50.720]
This is Parallel Adenis from Parallel Act Systems Irrigation.

[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.980]
So if you need to have your system irrigated, are you listening to Alex?

[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.420]
Here's a guy who could do it for you. These are the photos from Mammades.

[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.280]
We had a great time down there. It's a bit so it was fabulous.

[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.260]
And the rich of course is doing what he does best eating.

[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:07.580]
Alright, let's... Dear Field, didn't we do Dear Field?

[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:09.480]
Just can't be another Dear Field. Are you in Dear Field?

[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.740]
Dear Field, yeah. I'm back.

[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:11.400]
Oh, okay.

[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:13.520]
Are you the one that was on the phone or something?

[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.660]
Oh, yeah. I'm back.

[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:15.680]
How was it?

[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:16.540]
Oh, it's okay.

[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:17.080]
Okay.

[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:22.120]
I went to your friend's breakfast.

[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:24.560]
I mean, your friend's birthday party.

[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:25.160]
Bill's holder.

[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:25.920]
You got it.

[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:26.960]
I'm making yogurt.

[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:27.580]
Yeah.

[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:28.740]
Gilbert's a nice guy.

[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:29.440]
Yes he is.

[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:31.540]
Alex still not know what he did yesterday.

[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:35.740]
Now he did a really tacky thing yesterday and I hope he comes on and apologizes at life

[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:36.720]
although I know he won't.

[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:37.240]
But I know.

[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.820]
It was very, very poor.

[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.600]
And he was the one that he was on at Billy Acid about why we had so much of money here.

[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.720]
I mean, how many more shows does Gilbert need to be on?

[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.380]
Really. He's a really, really nice guy.

[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.080]
Yes he is.

[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:52.240]
And a lot of fun and he knows where it's at and that's it.

[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:52.940]
That's right.

[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:56.180]
And he was nailing fans as much as he was nailing Gilbert.

[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:57.940]
Was he?

[00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:58.360]
Yeah.

[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.420]
He hates to stand with a passion.

[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:05.540]
I guess that's the way I'm trying to replace somebody and the guy's down and up and you have to pick on him.

[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:07.000]
You know, I would never do that to stand.

[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:07.380]
No.

[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.080]
Although he is getting pretty, you know.

[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:09.940]
Anyway.

[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.540]
And your numbers should be lowered.

[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:16.720]
I mean, I'll probably lower than a really young because everybody here at public on the drivers listen to you all the time.

[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:17.960]
They should be lower than they are?

[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.600]
I mean, they're lower than they really are.

[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.020]
Yeah.

[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:21.560]
They're all the drivers you're living to.

[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:22.280]
Excellent.

[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:25.000]
Well, we're going to make sure you guys all get diaries next time.

[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.920]
John Raimi, he's a douchebag.

[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.200]
Okay. Excellent job, sir.

[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:28.700]
All right.

[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:29.280]
Have a good one.

[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:29.640]
Bye-bye.

[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.760]
Okay. It's 51-33 at WI.

[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:32.620]
I don't know what time it is.

[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.800]
It's about 12-46, 11-46.

[00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:36.980]
Whatever the hell time I want it to be, I guess.

[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:39.900]
What is that?

[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:40.780]
Call that for what?

[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:41.420]
On the year?

[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.600]
I'm not going to waste my time with that.

[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.060]
WI-O-D.

[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:48.980]
Yeah.

[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:49.900]
I'll talk to Neil.

[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:50.460]
Hold on.

[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:51.600]
Please WI-O-D.

[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.020]
Collect for Mr. G.

[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:53.720]
Will you buy it?

[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:54.460]
No.

[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.560]
Let's go to...

[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.220]
No, we're tired of him already.

[00:47:58.460 --> 00:47:59.340]
North Miami Beach.

[00:47:59.400 --> 00:47:59.620]
Hello.

[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:00.140]
Neil.

[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:00.620]

[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:01.260]
How you doing?

[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:01.960]
Good.

[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.080]
Well, no matter what anyone says, you're a great humanitarian.

[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.040]
You bet.

[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:09.280]
You hung out with that bird for the longest time.

[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:09.960]
Too long.

[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:10.220]

[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:10.860]
Much too long.

[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.940]
You know, and then with...

[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:12.940]

[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:15.080]
with the miller's house and with Gilbert.

[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.080]
You know, and then...

[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:17.560]
and then...

[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:18.640]
they abuse of you.

[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.240]
You know?

[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:20.960]
I wish.

[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.440]
You know, you wish.

[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.580]
No, I mean...

[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:24.500]
You're like a planet, Eric, just like...

[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:24.840]
What happened?

[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:25.560]
You said...

[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:27.400]
I mean, Alex just destroyed him.

[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:27.960]
He really did.

[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:30.360]
I heard him tell Gilbert to say red rover.

[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.060]
And then he was...

[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:34.920]
he was arguing about the dangerous crabs and everything.

[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.340]
I mean, he just ripped them.

[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:39.100]
He was ripping Gilbert's dangerous crabs?

[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.160]
Yeah, something...

[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.320]
We don't monkey around with Gilbert's dangerous crabs.

[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:43.480]
I'll tell you that right now.

[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.940]
Well, listen, I think...

[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:46.060]
Those are fighting words.

[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.120]
I know this is something you don't do that much.

[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:50.820]
But I think you should go on and show...

[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.280]
and just rip them and know how...

[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:52.480]
Who?

[00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:53.420]
I don't...

[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:54.140]
I don't see...

[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:56.340]
I don't go for that Steve King contrived.

[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.180]
I'm gonna come on and...

[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.360]
Well, let me...

[00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.280]
Who won?

[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:00.620]
He's being like Steve King.

[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.400]
He's coming in a couple minutes every day before you show me.

[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.820]
I don't have any problem with that.

[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:05.980]
But I want to say it again.

[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.920]
Why isn't anybody responding to this?

[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:08.560]
Are they all deaf?

[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.460]
Don't you remember...

[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:10.720]
Right.

[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.080]
...when he came in on Tuesday.

[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:12.680]
I know.

[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:13.900]
Maybe he didn't do it on...

[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:14.360]
Oh, Gilbert.

[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.340]
It was at the beginning of his show.

[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.180]
And he said it's a Gilbert-free...

[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.720]
He must have said this 30 times Tuesday all during the show.

[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:21.200]

[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.900]
It's a Gilbert-free Tuesday and tomorrow's gonna be Gilbert-free Wednesday.

[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:27.120]
And every day on my show's gonna be Gilbert-free because it's out of control...

[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:30.020]
between Neil and this one and even Stan's talking about it.

[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:31.280]
And he's right.

[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:32.780]
He had a very valid point.

[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:33.940]
It's just getting out of control.

[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.080]
Then he comes on yesterday and he's gonna have him on for 10 minutes...

[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.480]
and it turns into a...

[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:39.280]
a nightmare.

[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.840]
I don't get it.

[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:41.160]
Right.

[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:41.920]
Well, let me...

[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:42.460]
Let me answer something.

[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:43.700]
Why are you talking to Boy Gary?

[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:44.940]
What the hell do they want?

[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.040]
Talk to Boy Gary about getting Gilbert...

[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.100]
maybe half of what the bird made...

[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:49.940]
and put him on your show.

[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:51.660]
Maybe about 25 grand a year.

[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.420]
No. No. I work alone, sir.

[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:54.640]
You know, there's a lot of fun.

[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.200]
One to week. One to week.

[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:56.960]
Once in a while.

[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.260]
I don't like to be predictable.

[00:49:58.500 --> 00:49:59.180]
Once in a while.

[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:00.720]
Once in a while you'll bring Gilbert in.

[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:00.940]
Right.

[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.480]
We like him to call. Gilbert call once in a while.

[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:03.900]
Okay.

[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:05.040]
All right. See ya.

[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:05.320]
Right.

[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:08.320]
Are they gonna do something about the clock today?

[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:09.140]
Or is it...

[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:10.140]
I don't get that.

[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.500]
Where is this time come from?

[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.940]
I sure hope it's not connected to the atomic clock...

[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.280]
because otherwise the whole world is in big trouble.

[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.300]
I can just see the Queen standing out there looking at big Ben right now.

[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:22.700]
Or at Prince Charles.

[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:25.120]
Boy, they had a thing about...

[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:29.600]
I don't know, his entertainment tonight or one of those last night about Prince Charles and Diana.

[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.320]
He is so meus.

[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.480]
I mean, honest to God.

[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:34.280]
That man...

[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:35.280]
that child...

[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:36.580]
whatever he is...

[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.480]
I'm not sure what category he fits into...

[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.020]
but he is so ugly and scrawny...

[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:42.280]
and his ears are bigger than his body...

[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.700]
he looks like Dumbo on a bad day.

[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:49.540]
And he was in a bathing suit and he's got like the ugliest...

[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:50.700]
the most hideous body...

[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:54.060]
his body is almost as ugly as his face...

[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:56.460]
and those British with that royalty...

[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:57.920]
they just gotta be something done about that.

[00:50:58.060 --> 00:50:58.960]
Okay. They're just like the bird.

[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.160]
They don't know they lost the war.

[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:03.080]
Okay. Nobody ever told them that they lost the war.

[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:05.020]
And they just...

[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.840]
don't know what the hell is going on those British.

[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:08.500]
We're probably gonna get a call about that, huh?

[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.700]
It's one of those Queen worshipers.

[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:13.020]
Anyway, and stand is looking at my watch.

[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:14.740]
It's 1150, a WYOD.

[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:16.260]
All right.

[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.080]
Just stand.

[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.360]
Just stand.

[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:19.660]
Just stand.

[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.820]
Okay. It's 5133.

[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.020]
I think ever gonna fix that...

[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:25.820]
what the hell happened?

[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.220]
A clock on a wall...

[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.020]
and then we have a little clock on our board here...

[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:30.900]
and it's...

[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:34.620]
they both say 5133 and they're just stuck in suspended animation.

[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:37.520]
I wonder if there's something significant about that.

[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:38.840]
Maybe that's a code.

[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:40.660]
Here's a Pembroke Pine.

[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:41.060]
Hello.

[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:42.360]
Oh, where's the adrenaline hands?

[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:43.800]
Borshing nipples.

[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:45.220]
Neal.

[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:47.600]
This year it's called a birthday party the other night.

[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:52.120]
But I saw so many of these strange chronics like the guy with the eyes.

[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:52.700]
Yeah.

[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:54.800]
We were talking to him and getting to these a friend of.

[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.500]
Your other buddy Ken Block.

[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.340]
Don't I know that?

[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.100]
I don't even know that.

[00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:59.640]
He was all riddance of a feather.

[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:01.920]
You know, Ken's such a nice guy.

[00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:04.680]
And he loves to go in so much.

[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:05.040]
Yeah.

[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.240]
You screwed, go in so...

[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:06.440]
Yeah.

[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.120]
Oh, I know.

[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:07.700]
I know.

[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:11.160]
He's the one that came out to the track that they had highly and they had him thrown out.

[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.960]
He told that story and how you were saying, you know, he was...

[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.440]
He was just fun with you, you know.

[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:16.840]
He wasn't fun with anybody.

[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.740]
He's standing behind me babbling to nobody.

[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.060]
I mean, there was nobody there and he's standing way behind me.

[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:23.800]
Oh, what you do to the bird was I'm comfortable on Ken.

[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.160]
He's got this other goofball that hangs out with him as Alex.

[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:27.840]
And I'm telling you, it's just...

[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.860]
It's amazing when guys get to be that age and they have nothing better to do.

[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.840]
It's like sandbox time, you know.

[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:33.540]
It's unbelievable.

[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.780]
Anyway, last night I was in my way to class.

[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:39.020]
And I clicked in on Ernie Soach and showed just before seven.

[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:40.780]
Oh, well, you're covering all the bases now.

[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:41.780]
What can I say now?

[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.420]
And guess who he had on?

[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:44.380]
Mr. Levit.

[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:45.840]
Federal Levit.

[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.780]
Discussing his investigative...

[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.780]
An investigation he had done into your friend and Coral Gable.

[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:58.400]
And how you had done all these bad things to him and you had personally threatened him and his wife.

[00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:59.540]
Yeah, well, it's...

[00:52:59.540 --> 00:52:59.540]

[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:04.820]
And Ernie was defending you and Ernie pointed out that, well, if Neil was a bad guy,

[00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:07.020]
why was he restraining order put against the other guy?

[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:07.300]

[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:12.800]
And Ferrell goes, oh, because the concentration is so big and poor Jack is just wondering why...

[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.680]
Let me tell you something.

[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:14.640]
Let me tell you something.

[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:17.980]
Dick Ferrell is one of the most chronic troublemakers I've ever encountered in a business.

[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.400]
It no wonder that Steve is the one that found him.

[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.840]
And from the day that he came in his building, he was looking to make trouble.

[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.500]
That's his... that seems to be his main goal in life.

[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:27.600]
His goal in life.

[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:28.640]
He's a troublemaker.

[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.960]
Well, good luck to him, okay.

[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.200]
Anyway, last one.

[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:36.320]
Well, I really was really risen to his own level now at FPL.

[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.380]
I was sunk to whatever.

[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:38.900]
Yeah, well, whatever.

[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:39.380]
No way.

[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:46.560]
So last night when Stan was playing some of police song at 10, I clipped back to FPL and guess who did a 15 minute interview with Gilbert?

[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.700]
Paul wasn't going to Paul Wyle.

[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.460]
Yeah, crying.

[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:51.980]
Gilbert, you're my friend.

[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:55.840]
Why didn't you come on my show and Gilbert goes, well, you have my number, you never called me.

[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:56.560]
That's it.

[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:58.900]
I'm going to do...

[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:01.260]
Listen, I'm going to do the same thing that Bill did this morning, okay?

[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:03.120]
Gilbert, you're a wonderful guy.

[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:04.060]
I love you.

[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:04.700]
You're funny.

[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:07.740]
And I'll use the cards, but that's it.

[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:08.140]
But enough.

[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:09.340]
You're Gilbert enough.

[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:13.620]
I mean, just out of control, it's like a mania now.

[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:14.420]
It's insanity.

[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.460]
And I'm not saying that anybody owns anybody else.

[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:22.340]
But you just can't be all over the dial everywhere, monopolizing every show and time.

[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.540]
It takes the edge.

[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:24.600]
It's not funny anymore.

[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:25.160]
Absolutely.

[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:25.860]
But it's pathetic.

[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:26.640]
Absolutely.

[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:27.860]
I have a great day.

[00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:28.260]
Okay.

[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.780]
Yeah, that's inches it from me.

[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.560]
Gilbert, we wish you the best, okay?

[00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:35.080]
It's 1156 at WIOD.

[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.540]
There's an open line in Dave County if you're rush now.

[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.280]
But of course we've always got...

[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.020]
Just to be, you know, safe.

[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:42.840]
Kendall.

[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:43.560]
Hello.

[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:44.020]
Yeah.

[00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:44.820]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:45.280]
Okay.

[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.060]
Well, how does it look?

[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:48.000]
I'm a first time caller.

[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:48.880]
It is great.

[00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:50.480]
And how is it so far?

[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:52.140]
Well, I'm okay so far.

[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:53.500]
Are you standing up or sitting down?

[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:54.300]
I'm sitting down.

[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:54.840]
Holds on?

[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:55.880]
Yeah.

[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.820]
Something's out, but I got the clothes on.

[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.380]
Anyway, Gilbert Mania has taken over Kendall.

[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.480]
I mean, I'm a Miami-Dade student and we're all nuts about Gilbert.

[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:07.860]
Maybe you can have him on your station down there.

[00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:09.140]
Yeah, I wish we...

[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.340]
Hopefully we will soon.

[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:12.620]
But I made a little tape for you.

[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.300]
Maybe you'd like to hear Gilbert in action.

[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:15.640]
What is it?

[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:16.980]
Well, it's a little something I made.

[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:17.480]
Okay.

[00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:18.720]
You want to hear something you made?

[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:19.900]
Yeah, here it is.

[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:23.840]
My, my, my, my name, man, my, my, my, name, man.

[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:24.740]
Gilbert!

[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:25.400]

[00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:27.060]
Gilbert!

[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:27.660]
Gilbert!

[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:29.980]
Gilbert!

[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:30.960]
Gilbert!

[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:31.880]
Gilbert!

[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:32.460]
Gilbert!

[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:34.340]
Gilbert!

[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:35.380]
Gilbert!

[00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:36.020]
Gilbert!

[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:36.440]

[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:36.920]
Gilbert!

[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:38.840]
Gilbert!

[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:39.160]

[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:39.420]
Gilbert!

[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:39.720]

[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.920]
And I'm so thankful thank you for that.

[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:44.200]
And so, Gilbert!

[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:48.140]
I'm glad you guys were learning something about me.

[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:48.880]
We're thanking him.

[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:49.420]
Have a great thing.

[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:50.940]
That was cute.

[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:56.420]
1158 at WIOD, we have an opening in Dave County now where Albert Einstein just turned

[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:56.580]
up.

[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:57.300]
Now he's a good guy.

[00:55:57.340 --> 00:55:58.300]
I don't want to get to all of us.

[00:55:58.380 --> 00:55:59.380]
I've got to put it away now.

[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:06.140]
We have an open line in Dave County, 751 WIOD and one in Palm Beach, of course, at 655

[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:07.240]
Hmong.

[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:07.900]
If we can say that.

[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:09.200]
Can we steal a word from Lee Fowler?

[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.460]
Can we say Hmong on the ear?

[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:12.140]
Oh, God.

[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.260]
It just wears you out.

[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:15.160]
It just tears your kiss cues out.

[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.380]
But that's where it goes.

[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:22.720]
Don't forget Alex Bender today and there's something unusual, like comedian on the Alex

[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:23.240]
Bender Joe.

[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.160]
Joe Vega will be here at 3 p.m.

[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:26.960]
We all, of course, know Joe.

[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:28.460]
And that's it.

[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.260]
I'm sure there'll be more.

[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.560]
And of course, that live studio audience and food coming in.

[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:32.600]
I'll speak at a food coming in.

[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:33.360]
I don't want to start getting.

[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:33.940]
Did you call?

[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:35.860]
There are boys.

[00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:38.100]
Here's a guy who's worth every penny of it.

[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:39.360]
Well, probably my last chance.

[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:40.500]
I don't be broke after this.

[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:41.240]
I believe it.

[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:42.260]
Well, just send us the bill.

[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.580]
We won't pay it, but send it to us.

[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:44.400]
It'll make you feel better.

[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.000]
Yeah, send me a quarter.

[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:46.760]
I'll send it to you.

[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:47.060]
Okay.

[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.700]
Phil, we'll send you a stamp.

[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.320]
Oh, guys, send it to stamp.

[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:53.760]
Phil, yeah.

[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:55.820]
What happened with the bird yesterday?

[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.780]
I mean, why did he bother showing up?

[00:56:57.820 --> 00:56:58.840]
That's an excellent question.

[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:02.040]
Well, he thought he was going to be real cute and Mr. Cooy and he was going to come in

[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:07.180]
and crash the proceedings here and we just caught him with his tail between his legs

[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:07.740]
so to speak.

[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.900]
I think he did more damage than anything else.

[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:10.800]
Well, he sure didn't.

[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:11.220]
My eyes.

[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:11.720]
I'll tell you that.

[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:12.500]
I think he's a nerd.

[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:14.180]
I think he's a jerk.

[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:16.360]
I know they just took the whole cake in the ice cream out of here.

[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:18.060]
Well, we didn't want the party in here.

[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:19.640]
We wanted to eat the ice cream in the cake.

[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.600]
And where's my check?

[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.660]
Boy, this is getting pretty smart, man.

[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:25.460]
Here, I'll tell you that.

[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:26.260]
What is it, sir?

[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:26.800]
The bird?

[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:27.660]
The bird.

[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:29.100]
Yeah, the bird is history, right?

[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:29.820]
You've heard now.

[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:31.600]
He's not going to be showing up here any day now.

[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:32.640]
Well, he's not on this show.

[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:33.320]
I guarantee you that.

[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.660]
And if anybody else puts him on, I'll do a week and rip them.

[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:36.560]
I'll tell you right now.

[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:39.200]
We don't want him off the property, sir.

[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.760]
I have quite used to deal with Adam now.

[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.480]
We want his feathers off the property.

[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.640]
Let him go make his mess someplace else.

[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.960]
And then I'll go back to gloves 94 and be Irene Richard sidekick.

[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:48.920]
That's what he deserves.

[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:51.280]
As far as Alex goes, I think he's fine as his ditch.

[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:52.400]
I don't know.

[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:53.400]
Give him a little more time.

[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:53.940]
What is it?

[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:55.820]
I think he's trying to be too much like you.

[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.040]
I really know he's not.

[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:57.860]
He's not always.

[00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:58.320]
He always.

[00:57:58.480 --> 00:57:59.280]
Where I can't believe it.

[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:01.340]
No, he doesn't sound like me.

[00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:03.120]
You know, he doesn't.

[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:03.820]
OK, Neil.

[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.480]
He's a little more whiny than I am.

[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.020]
I'm probably sticking it up here.

[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:07.900]
I got to hang up today.

[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:08.620]
OK, see you.

[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:11.740]
It's probably one tell to a WIO day.

[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:13.280]
It's got nothing to do with him being like me.

[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:15.520]
It's just got to do what he's got to learn the lay of the land.

[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:18.200]
So to speak, the lay of the land, which is what he's looking for.

[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:20.180]
Here's the not-landing lady.

[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:20.920]
Hi, Neil.

[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:21.960]
Were you on before?

[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:22.580]
Yes, I was.

[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.340]
Well, I'm very sorry.

[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.700]
I was getting emotionally distraught and carried away.

[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:26.940]
And I shine you, I guess.

[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:27.420]
That's OK.

[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:27.960]
That's OK.

[00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:29.860]
You know, when I found out we're going to be related.

[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:31.320]
Really?

[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:32.240]
Related by Lisa.

[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:33.940]
What do you mean?

[00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:35.740]
My brother, Ciance.

[00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:35.860]
Is that a name?

[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:37.980]
Her answer is your landlord.

[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.280]
Are you serious?

[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:40.920]
Is that a real?

[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:42.780]
Isn't that great?

[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:43.200]
Yeah.

[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.160]
Your brother's fiance's aunt.

[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:47.820]
That's it.

[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:49.620]
Is my landlord my land lady?

[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:50.420]
Your land lady.

[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:51.000]
In California.

[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:51.660]
Right.

[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:53.040]
Well, they're nice people.

[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:53.700]
Yeah, they are.

[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:56.040]
And they also want me to keep my satellite dish.

[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:56.500]
That's right.

[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:57.280]
So is my brother.

[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:57.940]
Good.

[00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:58.560]
Oh, boy.

[00:58:58.680 --> 00:58:59.600]
I sure lucked out now.

[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:01.340]
He's got good ideas to help you.

[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:03.340]
I'll tell you one thing that's really fascinating.

[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:04.840]
And all of a sudden, the last couple of days,

[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:06.020]
my neighbors are so friendly.

[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:07.080]
It's disgusting.

[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:07.740]
Really?

[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:09.000]
They're just all walking their dog.

[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:10.180]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:11.560]
They weren't the ones they call.

[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:15.220]
I sure like to see that Ferrari finally move from over there

[00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:18.140]
for just, you know, and see Dave came and washed the car.

[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:18.820]
Boy.

[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:19.620]
Yeah.

[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.520]
Well, listen, that's a big improvement.

[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.260]
I'm not complaining.

[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:23.140]
At least they're speaking.

[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:23.940]
That's a good start.

[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:24.600]
That's true.

[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:25.220]
That's true.

[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:27.020]
So not planning.

[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.080]
We're going to hope it's good tonight.

[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:30.820]
Well, we know that Michael and the old senator there,

[00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:32.560]
who I'm getting so tired of, I could vomit,

[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:35.260]
but we know that they're going to have a little chat about something

[00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:36.600]
because they saw the preview last week.

[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:39.560]
So at least he'll be on for another 20 or 30 seconds,

[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:40.400]
maybe more tonight.

[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:42.080]
He'll be sharing with Liam D'Vane.

[00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:43.840]
And of course, we have all that black men.

[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.000]
Now, that ought to be pretty interesting.

[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.140]
All the blackmail stuff with Tom.

[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:48.880]
With Tom and what's his name?

[00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:50.020]
Yeah, I can't ever think of Tom.

[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:50.640]
I can't either.

[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:51.740]
I think there's a good reason.

[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:52.880]
Henry is not Henry.

[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:53.900]
It's Harvies.

[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:54.260]
They're Harold.

[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:54.900]
Harold.

[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.020]
I was close.

[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:56.460]
Harold.

[00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:57.960]
Yeah, Harold's a dork.

[00:59:58.320 --> 00:59:58.520]
Right.

[00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.780]
And you notice how fast, how quick he made up with his wife.

[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:02.800]
Hey, if I mean that was a...

[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.520]
That's a test you could get.

[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.260]
There wasn't even any fun, you know?

[01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:07.380]
He knew he'd have nobody else.

[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:07.760]
Yeah.

[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.700]
So she must need some contacts.

[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:11.500]
Definitely.

[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:12.740]
You see, he's a girl's top buck.

[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:14.340]
And she's settling for that.

[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.020]
Well, it'll never last.

[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.440]
No, never last.

[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:18.780]
And don't be pretty good.

[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:19.660]
I think so.

[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.360]
And I think they're going to put the William D'Vane away

[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.200]
at the end of the show tonight.

[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:23.280]
Yeah, let's hope so.

[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.480]
Put him in a rubber room for a while.

[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:25.640]
Well, both of us are fingers crossed.

[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.020]
And he'll go off and visit Donna Mills.

[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:28.420]
Yeah, that's a good idea.

[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.100]
Did you hear the thing that next season is

[01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:31.160]
a Michelle Ease last year?

[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:31.700]
Is it?

[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.080]
That story as long as Michael Steele.

[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:34.940]
Thanks for happening.

[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.520]
Now they'll be the main character.

[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:37.260]
Like, right.

[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:38.540]
Something to be...

[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.540]
Maybe he'll move in with Mack.

[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:39.880]
Right.

[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:40.860]
Have a great day.

[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:41.800]
Talk to you tomorrow.

[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:42.100]
Bye-bye.

[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:43.440]
There she is.

[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.220]
The not-slanding lady we got our ice cream and cake.

[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:46.120]
The cake is delicious.

[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.340]
The ice cream, of course, is vanilla.

[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:49.140]
Right?

[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:50.200]
It's okay.

[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.520]
But vanilla is so...

[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:56.480]
I do not believe that anybody likes vanilla ice cream.

[01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:59.040]
I mean, it's okay.

[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:03.320]
But it's nothing exciting.

[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.440]
Anyways, 42 at WIV.

[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.140]
Are you still eating?

[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.120]
Okay, hold on.

[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:13.200]
Or all gables.

[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:13.500]
Hello?

[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.260]
Don't be...

[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:20.740]
I'm sorry.

[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:21.500]
Oh.

[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.140]
Can't you finish it?

[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.300]
Come on, you can do it.

[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:27.600]
A...

[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.160]
Your cat.

[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:29.760]
Excellent.

[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.880]
It was worth it, wasn't it?

[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.960]
Yeah, after all, a sn�-sli-l-brotherhood week, right?

[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.380]
You feel better now, sir?

[01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:35.860]
Yeah.

[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:37.740]
See ya.

[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.120]
Okay, boy.

[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:41.020]
Uh, don't worry.

[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.520]
Hey, Leo, how you doing?

[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:43.060]
Okay.

[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:44.660]
It looks like I got a baseball question.

[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.640]
Get off this birdcrap.

[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.520]
Get off the birdcrap, excellent.

[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.460]
Uh, you see Mitch Whips, that Webster got a million fine?

[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.260]
No.

[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:52.800]
Yeah, from the Cleveland India.

[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:53.660]
Want to stay home?

[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.140]
Yeah, that's what I thought.

[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:56.360]
Boy, you got to be...

[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.700]
Yeah, I saw on the paper the other day.

[01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:57.940]
What?

[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:01.360]
A million fine for a guy who strikes out 100 times?

[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.700]
Well, lucky he only got 675,000.

[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:04.680]
That's what I heard the other day.

[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:06.100]
And I would pay him a lot more than that.

[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:07.340]
Just to come by the house.

[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:07.840]
You bet.

[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:09.580]
Mitch, when you were...

[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:10.500]
You were doing the game.

[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.920]
Were you there when Nelson Santovini was catching?

[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:13.260]
Sure.

[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:14.420]
How about Mike Brownie?

[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.020]
Yeah.

[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:16.080]
Danny Smith?

[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:16.680]
Yeah.

[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:17.360]
Ross Jones?

[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:17.880]
Sure.

[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:19.000]
Those are all my kids.

[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:21.000]
What do you mean they're all your kids?

[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.380]
Well, I used to coach those guys in the club.

[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.020]
Well, you used to call them.

[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:24.200]
Well, I'll say they're all your kids because they'll

[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.020]
be quite an accomplice.

[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:25.440]
Yeah, really.

[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.320]
I was the same time.

[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:27.860]
Because Ross Jones was Jewish.

[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:29.900]
Yeah, what?

[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:30.700]
No, he wasn't.

[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:32.100]
Yes, he was, I think, or half.

[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:32.960]
Maybe.

[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:35.420]
Danny Smith was a nice kid.

[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.420]
How about you?

[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:37.060]
Oh, I know.

[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:37.340]

[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.780]
Mike Brownie was pretty bizarre character.

[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.500]
He sure was.

[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:43.860]
I had him when he was 15 and he went all the way to the Legion team.

[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.840]
Did you ever give him a bar or so?

[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.640]
I don't think you knew how to take a bath.

[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:48.020]
No.

[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:50.580]
I just wanted to call and say the bird.

[01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:51.560]
Blow out of the nest.

[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:52.660]
Those were the days, blah.

[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:55.680]
That's when you went baseball was really odd tell you.

[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.700]
Yeah, when when skip was there, they, you know, yeah, they had a good team.

[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.160]
Well, I'm not saying it to them.

[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:03.060]
I could now that they might not have a surprising season this year.

[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:04.340]
They start out good against Stetson.

[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:05.020]
Red to toe.

[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:05.580]
You bet.

[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.620]
OK, nobody liked my buddy Ron.

[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.240]
Let me tell you.

[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.140]
Well, yeah, we grew up right down the street from Ron.

[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:10.660]
He's a great guy.

[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.340]
Ron is the greatest.

[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:12.460]
OK, have a nice day.

[01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:12.800]
See you.

[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:13.060]
Bye-bye.

[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.180]
144, a WIOD.

[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:16.620]
That sounded like George Washington there.

[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:17.860]
Sound like the father of our country.

[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:18.700]
Well, this is not bad.

[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:18.940]
Take.

[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.160]
I like the artificial coloring the best.

[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:24.200]
Hmm, not bad at all.

[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:27.820]
What I say, Stetson, sitting on what excuse me?

[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:28.380]
OK.

[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.180]
Fight the big one.

[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.220]
OK, just leave me alone.

[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:32.940]
I have my take.

[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:34.580]
Hey, my seat.

[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.500]
Now is my mic rodent all now.

[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.180]
You made me say you made me say right.

[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:42.080]
Hi, everybody.

[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:46.660]
This is Gilbert and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers.

[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:50.480]
And I like it when Neil sits in on my show.

[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.400]
Anytime, Gilbert.

[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.780]
OK, dear Phil, still eating, of course.

[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:54.920]
No, of course.

[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:56.360]
Let's go to a parkland.

[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:57.420]
Hey, Neil.

[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.020]
How you doing?

[01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.080]
This is all about you.

[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:00.100]
I'm like, you're eating too.

[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:02.600]
This is all about Gilbert.

[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:03.120]
Yeah.

[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:06.560]
First observation suggestion, then a Gilbert's fire at work.

[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:11.500]
I don't know if you realize Gilbert is the very broad element of Neil Rogers.

[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:12.160]
Yes, I do.

[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:15.820]
And you can use him in that same way, Letterman uses that.

[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:17.660]
But Melmond's only on once in a while, though.

[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:18.720]
Yeah, once in a while.

[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:19.760]
He's on a wide.

[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:20.640]
Exactly!

[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.180]
Otherwise, he'll be on once in a while.

[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:22.480]
Right.

[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:27.840]
In any case, I'm just saying that before you decide to get rid of you the first one to have

[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:29.280]
on your show, no, it was not.

[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:32.080]
And you're the first one to have him on the show.

[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.140]
It's not on the phone.

[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.820]
Oh, no, I wasn't.

[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:35.660]
Joey Reynolds.

[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:37.640]
Ah, you had him a door elaborate last week.

[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.120]
Well, that's right, you're right.

[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:43.960]
Anyway, in any case, Giver in order for Gilbert was on a letter of K-Hale last night.

[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:44.240]
I know.

[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.760]
He did the $50 to answer when I heard to the great fine.

[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:47.120]
Yup.

[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:48.280]
OK, that's it, Neil.

[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.300]
Everywhere okay, good luck you

[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:56.600]
146 the W.I.D. Boy's been pretty interesting day. We had a little um what the hell did we have?

[01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:01.640]
Well, we had the pizza from GTR that they gave us very grudgingly and also made a few of derogatory comments

[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.880]
I know it's for a man

[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:07.340]
Next time anybody except Meg's son comes over from GTR. They've had it. What's his name?

[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.860]
What is it Robin as

[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:11.540]
Embatman

[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.940]
Orabi as in Joe Jr

[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:19.440]
Okay, Robby you didn't come by here anytime. Okay, just take your clothes off nobody will tell mom

[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:22.840]
He is getting look better isn't he in the beginning? He was pretty schmutz you look a man

[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:26.500]
He'd like some help and now he's gonna look a little better or I'm getting more desperate

[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.640]
I'm not sure which it is this Saturday night is backed by popular demand

[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.080]
You can win cash in a poppin o'hara super five thousand dollar giveaway

[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:37.160]
This Saturday night ended when you're sure of five thousand bucks in cash

[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:41.560]
I wonder where the hell is this show gone is this mobile still here in Boka? Yes, I am the hawk

Shocking sir I knew that would set you back a couple it takes me a bag

Hey, no, when did this Gilbert guy come from anyway? Where did he come from? Yeah, all of a sudden now I had this guy's a little over town

[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:58.760]
He's like it's like an epidemic sir. He's everywhere. He's spreading all over the radio dial

Know who that is. Okay. I just wonder and one other thing you remember about five or six years ago

[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:31.720]
They said that if they ever got a basketball team we get a hockey team. Yeah, and they tried to sell tickets or season tickets

[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:35.760]
No, no, that's a long time ago. That was the screaming Eagles. That's 14 years ago

[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:39.300]
