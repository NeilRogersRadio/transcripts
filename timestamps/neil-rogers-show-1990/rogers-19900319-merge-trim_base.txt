[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.380]
This comes across the timeline passes off to the top of the key taken by Julius E.T.

[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.980]
Bob Oh, Bob, what an electrifying one-handed windmill dam!

[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.580]
Oh, the Dr. E.T.

[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.220]
This is the doctor.

[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.160]
And when I'm on a fast break from the usual breakfast routine, there's only one place for me.

[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.960]
Slam, dunk it, don't knock.

[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.320]
Check out the All Star lineup.

[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.700]
They got Dale Dawkins, Chackloth Thunder, Donuts, Will Chameleon, Finger Rolls, and even Moses Malone.

[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.160]
One-handed jam, Bill Donuts.

[00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.280]
Hmm, hmm.

[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.960]
Hey, Doc, how about a box and one to go?

[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.660]
Yeah, baby.

[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.980]
And give me a cup of coffee.

[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.980]
My one, medium one, a lardewon.

[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.000]
A lardewon.

[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.600]
But no Korean, please.

[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.260]
Oh, that's bad.

[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.660]
So make your best move to slam, dunking Donuts.

[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.120]
We stub off food in your face.

[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.600]
Oh, terrible.

[00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.860]
Get it off, okay?

[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.700]
Stop the cart.

[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.320]
They suck.

[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.120]
They're terrible.

[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:43.360]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.800]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.800]

[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.940]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.940]

[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.940]

[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.940]

[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.140]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.420]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.420]

[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.420]

[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.580]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.580]

[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.740]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.300]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.740]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.120]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.380]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.380]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.100]
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.120]
Crank.

[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.560]
I love those.

[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.100]
Man, that's my favorite thing.

[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.000]
And the whole world is when we get them when they're calling in.

[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.220]
And as soon as they realize they're on the air,

[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.440]
they go into a cold panic.

[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.320]
W-I-O-D.

[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.500]
Hey, Neal, how you doing?

[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.900]
Okay.

[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.760]
Did you ever get tested?

[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.260]
Wait a minute.

[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.380]
Wait, uh, see, I can see the way these little games.

[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.680]
Just keep talking real fast so I can't keep you on hold, right?

[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.860]
You're not fooling me.

[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.040]
Go ahead, though.

[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.220]
The technique worked.

[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.040]
All right, it's quick.

[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.560]
I promise.

[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.880]
You weren't fooling me, though.

[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.320]
Did you think you were fooling me?

[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.780]
Well.

[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.560]
You know, what can I say?

[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.680]
Yeah, don't even take a breath.

[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.340]
Just keep spewing it out.

[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.920]
When and down, spewing it out.

[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.980]
That's what Joey says.

[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.560]
Hey, you got to watch when you're spewing things out.

[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.080]
Now, what do you think of Bill Marshall being our new sidekick, so?

[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.820]
Oh, he's an asshole.

[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.220]
Thank you.

[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.560]
He's an asshole.

[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.080]
Get him out of there.

[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.440]
Don't hold back.

[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.460]
I like this real audience a lot.

[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.120]
No wonder I stick around in this God for sake in hell.

[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.580]
We got a great audience, you know?

[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.360]
They don't beat around the bush, Bill.

[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.640]
They come right out.

[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.480]
This fact thinks you're an asshole, Bill.

[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.800]
It's Miami-Man.

[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.280]
And he's only got very thin hair, too, by the way.

[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.600]
Oh, yeah?

[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.240]
He probably hangs out with Alex and Eric Lambert.

[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.260]
Yeah, they can go to those hair transplant, but together.

[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.340]

[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.080]
And then, you've ever find that MSU fightsong, you got to play it in the other end of the sweet 16.

[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.040]
Oh, don't start.

[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.080]
I'm going to call it that.

[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.460]
I don't know where it is, though.

[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.680]
I don't know what the hell stand did with it.

[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.640]
Yeah, you got to get on his butt, so to speak.

[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.640]
No, thanks.

[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.440]
Yeah, okay.

[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.080]
Not for me.

[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.140]
Okay, well, my-

[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.640]
I don't know how big around here.

[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.620]
I don't know where the hell it is.

[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.140]
Okay.

[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.800]
How about those Michigan Wolverines, huh, Mandage?

[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.540]
Oh, I'll tell you what.

[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.980]
Woo!

[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.500]
Yeah.

[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.460]
Oh, I loved every second of that one.

[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.120]
Yeah, they can take a shower for a long time.

[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.140]
149 points.

[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.040]
149 points.

[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.060]
Yeah.

[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.660]
What the hell is that?

[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.180]
Boy, Ellen Merrimaut, it's a good team.

[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.080]
I'll tell you what, I didn't really underestimate it.

[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.680]
Yeah, they are good.

[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.600]
They can shoot.

[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.800]
They can shoot.

[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.280]
So to speak.

[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.060]
Yeah, so to speak.

[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.240]
Okay, Neil, we're all behind you.

[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.500]
Oh, what is that name?

[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.800]
I just did Joe.

[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.260]
Okay.

[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.920]
I'll get emotional.

[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.360]
See ya.

[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.020]
W-I-O-D.

[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.880]
Neil.

[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.380]
Yeah.

[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.340]
Guess what?

[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.920]
I can't hear you.

[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.540]
Hello?

[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.160]
When you're going to spew whatever you're about to spew, at least make sure we hear it.

[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.120]
I know, you're great.

[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.000]
I know that.

[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.920]
Could you put me at home?

[00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.340]
Sure.

[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.540]
See, butlicker.

[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.140]
See, that butlicker, I don't go for that.

[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.560]
The engraciators out there.

[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.860]
Does Joey like that?

[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.960]
He likes it, doesn't he?

[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.200]
Yeah, he likes to be stroked.

[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.000]
No, he likes to.

[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.440]
So to speak.

[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.440]
He likes conflict?

[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.020]
Yeah.

[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.380]
When's that going to start?

[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.760]
Oh, you mean with management?

[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.120]
Well, they've been going on for a long time.

[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.760]
Over the ratings.

[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.420]
Boy, he's worked in a lot of places for a guy 70.

[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.260]
Okay, we have an open line in Dade County, 7519-463.

[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.560]
If you want to take any cheap shots at Joey, now's the time to do it, because Bill is here.

[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.920]
None of you know who Bill is.

[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.820]
Or you can call him take cheap shots at him.

[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.840]
All of the one guy did a good job.

[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.640]
There were more than well-known.

[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.720]
Well, that was pretty much a generic cheap shot.

[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.820]
You can call anybody an asshole.

[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.860]
Yeah, but in your case, he meant it.

[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.120]
Here's a mobile in...

[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.760]
How did the remote go Saturday, Chuck?

[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.960]
Good?

[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.680]
Where was it?

[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.840]
Chuck, good to the Saturday.

[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.300]
We can magazine show.

[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.840]
I forgot.

[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.800]
Well, actually, I slept.

[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.580]
I can't believe it.

[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.840]
I slept till 20 till noon on Saturday.

[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.720]
I haven't slept.

[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.440]
Usually, my dogs give me up at about 1.7, which they did do.

[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.600]
But then I went back to bed and I just slept like a baby.

[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.080]
I haven't slept that late in years.

[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.700]
Well, I used to do eight to midnight.

[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.780]
There are a lot of nights I go out to eat, come home and watch a little TV, go to bed at three,

[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.200]
and sleep till 10 or 11, even noon some days.

[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.660]
But now, that's a change.

[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.780]
Since I did that morning show on Zaden, beat the crap out of Joey.

[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.720]
I mean, here's a...

[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.720]
You didn't have to beat the crap out of Joey there.

[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.060]
Wait a minute.

[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.060]

[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.360]
You hear that?

[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.920]
You hear the racket coming from FM?

[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.860]
It's a low rumble.

[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.560]
Does that happen on Saturday?

[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.240]
No.

[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.980]
No, sometimes from this side.

[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.760]
If they're producing...

[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.420]
Sometimes.

[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.600]
Okay, here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.080]
Hello.

[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.780]
And that also frosted my butt when he had what's his name?

[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.960]
Larry Brenleron here.

[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.140]
And the guy called him wanted him to play the Bill Calder song sometimes on the...

[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.320]
on the...

[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.980]
What is that he plays?

[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.460]
The flute?

[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.160]
What is that thing he plays?

[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.640]
Whatever it is, the mouth organ.

[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.980]
And he wouldn't play it.

[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.380]
Malice got all bent out of shape.

[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.860]
What is his problem?

[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.620]
Okay, why can't he just warm up a little bit?

[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.500]
Okay?

[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.300]
Am I right or is it my imagination?

[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.820]
Melvin says I'm right.

[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.840]
Chuck, of course, also says I'm right, which is surprising because he's a newsman.

[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.640]
He tries to be near the middle.

[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.000]
What?

[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.800]
And what do you say, sir?

[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.780]
I say you're right.

[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.220]
Okay.

[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.080]
Uncle Neil.

[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.380]
You're just a butt-looking.

[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.920]
What is it?

[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.000]
Uncle Neil, the news...

[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.780]
The news can't say a few moments ago.

[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.540]
This Tommy Mercer says that all the Canadians are happy.

[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.840]
That baseball is going to start.

[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.100]
Why don't they just go home?

[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.780]
Yeah, well that's what they're excited about.

[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.300]
They're going to be playing in Toronto and Montreal.

[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.960]
They're all on their way home right now.

[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.040]
Go home for hockey.

[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.960]
They'll leave us alone.

[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.380]
That's right.

[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.120]
It's almost time for the Stanley Cups.

[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.960]
So put on your cups and head north, folks.

[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.720]
Get boot of here already, A.

[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.840]
Yeah, A.

[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.880]
Joey will take him.

[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.040]
A.

[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.520]
Put him on the A train.

[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.840]
The A train, and we'll listen to...

[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.960]
With Joey S. Conductor.

[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.540]
You would love to sit here in life at my material because mine is funny.

[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.300]
And I don't have three by five cards, Bill.

[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.160]
Okay, listen, have a great day, sir.

[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.720]
Thank you, sir.

[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.280]
All right, 12 minutes back.

[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.140]
You don't have to knock Joey just because he's not here.

[00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.520]
Where's he?

[00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.080]
He in town?

[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.440]
I just came in to get some promotion because he's in town.

[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.660]
He's talking about Joey and...

[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.140]
Well, what the hell is there to talk about?

[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.000]
He's a potty mouth-old man with no act and no show.

[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.840]
And he says, faggot every 30 seconds.

[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.600]
Has that show?

[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.320]
Exactly what it is that gets folks to listen.

[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.580]
When you rip him.

[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.220]
What?

[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.460]
That's it.

[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.920]
We think that's one of the...

[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.000]
One of the gonna start writing it down.

[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.000]
It didn't help but the she...

[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.020]
I talked about him incessantly over there and his numbers dropped like a rock.

[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.200]
Oh, wait.

[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.320]
He went down to a one-three.

[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.200]
You know what a one-three translates to.

[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.020]
It's like...

[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.500]
We had more kids in this room than we're listening to Joey and Morning Drive.

[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.280]
Well, that was a great inside job over there.

[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.000]
Management, submarine that show,

[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.380]
much more effectively than even competition could have.

[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.200]
Oh, here we go.

[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.480]
In other words, these guys that blames the management.

[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.840]
Thank God I never do that.

[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.160]
It's 12th, 13th at WIOD.

[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.960]
We'll be right back.

[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.520]
See what's in.

[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.600]
Double-dry fire, dig.

[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.620]
Trump, the monster ego.

[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.300]
Live like a king.

[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.160]
And frolic twid, some new-byel chicks.

[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.100]
And had himself a fling.

[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.480]
Little wife, Viva, no.

[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.240]
Sood that arasco, Trump.

[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.080]
And soop the house, and 20 mill.

[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.720]
And other fancy stuff.

[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.300]
Oh, together they would shut her.

[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.440]
Buying anything for sale.

[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.600]
Viva, no kipped.

[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.260]
Oh, look out, perched.

[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.060]
Wild Trump went out for sale.

[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.760]
Starlit spam sent in bows.

[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.740]
Wood bow and air he came.

[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.320]
I rate Pimps wood lord, their price.

[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.960]
When Trump roared out his name.

[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.760]
Oh, Trump, the monster ego.

[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.460]
Live like a king.

[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.280]
And frolic twid, some new-byel chicks.

[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.040]
And had himself a fling.

[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.360]
Then one night it happened.

[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.660]
All the papers gave the score.

[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.420]
Trump's game was a doatery.

[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.120]
To Ivana, this meant wolf.

[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.360]
Castles and casinos.

[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.280]
Trump would all retain.

[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.460]
Por Ivana got the shaft.

[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.120]
Pre-Nup chose made it plain.

[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.760]
Without his lifelong friend.

[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.540]
His marriage on the shelf.

[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.780]
Then Trump's that monster ego.

[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.940]
Gladly made love to himself.

[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.940]
Oh, Trump, the monster ego.

[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.700]
Live like a king.

[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.440]
And frolic twid, some new-byel chicks.

[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.300]
And had himself a fling.

[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.960]
Trump, the monster ego.

[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.660]
Live like a king.

[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.480]
And frolic twid, some new-byel chicks.

[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.960]
And had himself a fling.

[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:06.460]
Too long.

[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.100]
Too long, ponderous, weak, pretty weak.

[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.380]
1218 at WID.

[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.080]
What would you get down there?

[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.020]
Scale of 1 to 2.

[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.580]
Oh, definitely towards a 2.

[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.360]
A 1?

[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.820]
On a scale of 1 to 2, it would definitely be on here or 2.

[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.000]
Up near a 2?

[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.540]
Boy, this man is profound.

[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.300]
You've been hanging around with Joey too long.

[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.440]
Yeah.

[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.200]
What do you mean not that song?

[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.160]
That's his latest, more than Joey plays.

[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:33.580]
That's right.

[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.420]
If he'd start playing, he might get a 2.

[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.600]
I doubt it.

[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.060]
But it's worth a shot at this point.

[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.780]
1219 at WID.

[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.720]
Bill Marshall is hanging out in the background, making guttural sounds.

[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.320]
Here's a mobile on I-95.

[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.200]
Are you there?

[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.340]
Yeah, I know how you're doing.

[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:51.800]
OK.

[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.900]
I got a question for Bill.

[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.400]
That was pretty weak, wasn't it, that ACN bit?

[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.460]
No, it was great.

[00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:58.320]
Crapie.

[00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.340]
No, that's all right.

[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.180]
Bill was an Alex.

[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.700]
Listen, Bill, whatever happened at Guy Lary that was doing the show,

[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.480]
the weather reports, and all that.

[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.260]
You remember on the sheet?

[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.600]
He's living at a home in Philadelphia.

[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.200]
Is that guy, or is that guy?

[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.480]
That's like a retirement home.

[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.280]
Is that guy for real?

[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.160]
Old folks home.

[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.200]
Yeah, that guy is honest to God for real.

[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.520]
That's that guy's fond of.

[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:17.860]
Well, it was.

[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.920]
That was the highlight of the show as far as I'm concerned.

[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.200]
Well, it sure wasn't Joey.

[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.040]
It's like an idiot Savon type.

[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.700]
Knows every oldie ever recorded.

[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.080]
That was what he was fond of.

[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.420]
What do you mean an idiot Savon?

[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.520]
You mean literally?

[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:30.740]
Yes, honest to God.

[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.680]
Yeah, you were.

[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:31.880]
He was.

[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:32.020]

[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:32.200]
He was.

[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:32.340]
He was.

[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.440]
Are you serious?

[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.160]
I mean, Joey was exploiting somebody like maybe Gilbert.

[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.800]
He was exploiting someone.

[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:41.720]
Yeah, can you imagine?

[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.140]
Yes.

[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.400]
Well, Neil, do you know the guy I'm talking about?

[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:44.720]
No.

[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.520]
I don't know if there's a card around or something.

[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.840]
That guy is funny attack.

[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:49.920]
Well, great.

[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.280]
He's got a weird voice.

[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:51.840]
Mm-hmm.

[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.440]
Yes, he does.

[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:53.840]
Easy.

[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.980]
Well, that's going to be our joy for the show from 2 to 6.

[00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.160]
He's going to be exploiting mentally handicapped

[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.140]
and retarded people.

[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.760]
Maybe they ought to have a guilt or playoff with that guy.

[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.680]
Him and him and Larry.

[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:05.680]
Okay, sir.

[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.120]
Thank you so much.

[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.720]
That's a revealing 20 afternoon at WIOD.

[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.720]
We have an open line in Dade County where Rainman just hung up 751.

[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.720]
9463, 751 WIOD.

[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.100]
One is the Oscars on.

[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:20.640]
Is that Sunday?

[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.560]
Saturday, Monday.

[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:23.740]
Next week?

[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.500]
Next week?

[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.280]
Monday?

[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.280]
Oh, well, we don't want to talk about it anyway.

[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.780]
I'm sure we'll hear lots about it in the afternoon.

[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.480]
Anyway, let's go to...

[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:34.940]
I'm serious.

[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.920]
I never really dreamed that I would get to the point where I'd be hostile

[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.660]
and bitter with this guy, but I am.

[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:40.760]
It's not a joke anymore.

[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:41.960]
He just bugs me.

[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.960]
You don't like me off.

[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.960]
No, I didn't say I don't like him because I don't even know him.

[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.220]
But I just...

[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.720]
He just says such frustrating stupid things, okay?

[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:53.800]
Okay?

[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.300]
Okay.

[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:55.100]
Good.

[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.620]
Here's a...

[00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.100]
Mobile in Palm Beach.

[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.240]
Oh, that laugh is just...

[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.420]
There just ends chills up and down my spine.

[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.060]
Is it irritating to me?

[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.940]
You sound like a cross between Lee Fowler and Paul Harvey Jr.

[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:08.900]
You really do.

[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:09.780]
Yes, sir.

[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:10.520]
Hello.

[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.060]
Don't be intimidated by this spaker, sir.

[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:13.820]
Not at all, I am.

[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.340]
He's been sent here by Joy Reynolds.

[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.880]
He's an Ojrán provocateur.

[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.080]
I got a little bit of a Joey Spire for it for you.

[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:19.360]
Okay.

[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.940]
Well, actually, I want to talk to Bill.

[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:21.440]
Billy, you there?

[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:22.600]
I'm sure, sure, Ann.

[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:22.960]
Okay.

[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:24.020]
Yeah.

[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.680]
I go along with Ann.

[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.460]
Bill, I don't know if you remember.

[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.500]
I gave Joey a call on Saturday and I was at it.

[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.240]
Can you guys...

[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:30.720]
You're the one.

[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:31.460]
Yeah.

[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.360]
Well, I just Joey up.

[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.860]
I was at the Joey Wine.

[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.080]
He thought Neil ripped him so much all the time.

[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.040]
Yeah, you really didn't seem to have an answer form.

[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.960]
Because he sucks, sir.

[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.120]
Is that an answer that...

[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.580]
But see, Neil, the one thing he did say was that you have a key or a G-Go.

[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:49.980]
Almost like a...

[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:50.760]
No, I don't.

[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:51.900]
I just Steve Kane type of...

[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.420]
No, I don't have any E-Go, sir.

[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.220]
I have no E-Go.

[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.180]
I work with management that's brutal and I have no E-Go.

[00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.900]
But why do you consistently rip, Joey?

[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.800]
Maybe Bill can answer something.

[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.880]
I just answer the question because I think he sucks.

[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:03.960]
Because it's something to do.

[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.280]
No, not at all.

[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:05.900]
I think...

[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.260]
What do you mean?

[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.900]
Didn't you just say before that I haven't been talking about him lately

[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.560]
and you came in to try to stir up a little publicity because he does...

[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:11.840]
Absolutely.

[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.860]
And nobody calls and you couldn't buy a show with the million dollars.

[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.500]
Oh, it's so difficult.

[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.140]
Something like that.

[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.040]
I would say something positive.

[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.420]
Hey, I think we're nearly...

[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.140]
I think we're nearly just a great job.

[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.180]
He goes up every morning and he's a big member of his own business.

[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.080]
He doesn't use anybody else's material.

[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.780]
Why not rip the personalities at the other stage?

[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.060]
I think Hayd Goldberg, my best friend, is wonderful.

[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.480]
He tells it like it is.

[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.040]
I think Chuck Meyer is a great American.

[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.120]
He's a wonderful newsman.

[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.120]
He's got a...

[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.440]
Would just die to have two to six in the afternoon?

[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:41.780]
He would.

[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:42.460]
He won't admit it.

[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.140]
But he wants to be a taco so bad.

[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:44.820]
And he would be good.

[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:45.560]
He would do a good job.

[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.000]
That's a great show on Saturday morning.

[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:47.900]
If nobody listens.

[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.140]
But Neil, how often do you do this except to make a point?

[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.340]
Look at Meg Green, for example.

[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.740]
She's a legend in her own mind.

[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.840]
Now she's going into TV.

[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.360]
She's lost control of herself.

[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.140]
She's gone nuts.

[00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:57.760]
She is.

[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.620]
She's a legend among the blue hairs.

[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:00.620]
Well.

[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.680]
Every day when they go down to see the CD rate,

[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.720]
they have their little Meg Green picture in their wallet.

[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.460]
See how?

[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.160]
Look at that.

[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.320]
Meg said, don't worry.

[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.300]
It'll be okay.

[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.580]
Would you see Neil the plug that you just get into a bridge?

[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.360]
I got to make Green much better than what you gave to Chuck.

[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:12.720]
All right.

[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.560]
Joey's great.

[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.020]
Okay.

[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.000]
Joey's got the best.

[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.000]
It's like his of death.

[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:17.740]
Don't do that.

[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.840]
You're the one that brought him up.

[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.480]
You're the one that brought him up, sir.

[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:27.720]
I brought him up.

[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.280]
You've been ripping him for the last hour.

[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.680]
If I've been ripping Joey for the last hour, why?

[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.440]
First of all, let me say this to you, sir.

[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:34.700]
I have a question.

[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:34.700]

[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:34.700]

[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:34.700]

[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:34.700]

[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.980]
I didn't even think about Joey until his sidekick

[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.340]
muscled his way into the studio.

[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.100]
He worked there.

[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.100]
And now he's accomplished just what he wanted.

[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.420]
You're complaining about it.

[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.900]
He's happy about it, okay?

[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.620]
He worked there.

[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.080]
He needs the publicity.

[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.400]
This station don't give anybody any promotion.

[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.700]
Say goodbye, sir.

[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.280]
Who was that?

[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.600]
24 afternoon at WIOD.

[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.360]
We have an opening in Dave County, 751 WIOD.

[00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.140]
If you have an opening in your teeth, then call

[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.880]
ProSmart Cosmetic Dentistry.

[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.100]
But what a segue that was, huh, Bill?

[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:04.660]
That was close.

[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.580]
That was pretty sneaky, wasn't it?

[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:06.820]
Very, very.

[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.660]
You have a little space there between your teeth.

[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:09.300]
I do.

[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.960]
And also in your forehead, I noticed.

[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.940]
But anyway, ProSmart Cosmetic Dentistry, these are

[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.820]
micro thin shells that they adhere to the surface of your natural teeth or caps.

[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.020]
Porcelain laminates.

[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.160]
There's no pain, no drilling, no slicing, no strain.

[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.860]
It'll make it a pleasure almost to go to the dentist.

[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.500]
That's why a lot of people, even people with money, walk around in a smile

[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.800]
and their teeth are, you ask yourself, how can they look like that?

[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.960]
Because people are terrified of the dentist, right?

[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:36.580]
They are.

[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.800]
You're not too crazy about going.

[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:38.300]
No.

[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:38.760]
No.

[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:39.720]
It's a halftime.

[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.100]
But anyway, ProSmart is endorsed by the American Deadly Association.

[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.600]
They did a whole hour on the Donahue show, which I saw the tape, and it's amazing.

[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.700]
The before and after, like it takes like 20 years of, in fact, joy might help him.

[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.840]
Take 20 years off your age.

[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.720]
You can look like 60.

[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.320]
And affordable payment plans are available.

[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.700]
It comes with a lifetime guarantee.

[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.540]
So if you're really disgusted with the chipped cracked teeth and the gaps between your teeth,

[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.940]
or whatever the problem is in Admouthe viewers, you call ProSmartle.

[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.020]
And if you tell them that Neil Rogers told you to call, you'll get a consultation,

[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.020]
absolutely free, and I'll show you what your teeth can look like.

[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.220]
Here's the number to call.

[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.200]
1-800-940-Smile.

[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.980]
They have offices in Dade, Broward and West Palm Beach.

[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.120]
You call them right now for your free consultation.

[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.800]
1-800-940-Smile for ProSmartle.

[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:27.520]
3-610-2-I-O-T

[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.760]
Listen, more fun on the number one sound.

[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.300]
In town, the wonderful radio, 61.

[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.420]
OK, next time Ron St. John calls, let's play that before he does his talk up.

[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.360]
It would fit right in 28 past noon.

[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.920]
Been a very pressure-packed Monday.

[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.160]
First, we had the two groups from Piper High outstanding.

[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.700]
Boy, they were great, some greater than others.

[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.880]
And then we had, what's his name in here?

[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.440]
And he just left, by the way, he'll be pleased to know that.

[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.340]
We froze him out.

[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.960]
See, that works every time.

[00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.520]
And we got it so cold in here you could hang meat from the ceiling.

[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.500]
And we froze his ass out, so to speak.

[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:07.460]
So Bill Marshall's gone, and he was, what can I say?

[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:08.960]
What am I going to say?

[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.460]
Am I going to say that the guy was in here.

[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.640]
I told him to his face that his laugh made me, it made my skin crawl and the joey sucks.

[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.820]
And what else am I going to say?

[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.260]
I'm not talking just now that he left.

[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.300]
That's what I'm saying.

[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.320]
He's terrible.

[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.140]
Okay, dear field, hello.

[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.120]
Oh, get out of here.

[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.800]
Will you go to it somewhere else?

[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.760]
Here's a pay phone.

[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.360]
Bill.

[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.520]
Mr. G.

[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.300]
Was that BM next to you?

[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:30.400]
I beg your pardon?

[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.460]
Was that Bill Marshall?

[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.200]
BM, yes.

[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.500]
Well, that's why those are his initials.

[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.320]
Did you listen to him Saturday?

[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.720]
I heard about ten minutes.

[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.920]
They were ripping you with Dave Game.

[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.500]
Don't ask me what?

[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.260]
Dave Game?

[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:42.900]
Yes.

[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:43.820]
I'm not that big.

[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:44.480]
I know.

[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.840]
But speaking of that, we're having a march for the fat people.

[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:48.680]
Are you available?

[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.080]
A march for the fat people, only if Champagne Lou shows up.

[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.080]
He said he'd be there.

[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:54.500]
I'll bet.

[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:55.500]
So how's it going?

[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.300]
Okay.

[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.360]
Not too bad.

[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.680]
What's the purpose of your call?

[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.440]
You seem to be all over the place here today, kind of like Buc shot.

[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.520]
Or Buc me.

[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.440]
That's what they call me, Buc.

[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:04.820]
Yeah.

[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:05.860]
Buc him up.

[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.180]
Well, listen to me, I'll keep it in your pants.

[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:08.720]
Okay.

[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:09.480]
See ya.

[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:09.860]
See ya.

[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.260]
Round Bucca.

[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.080]
Yes, is that the Marshall and any relation to Peter Marshall?

[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.460]
Yes, that's his brother.

[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.300]
Oh.

[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.180]
And what are the nephew Pete LaCocke used to play baseball for the Cubs?

[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.500]
Right, I remember him well.

[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.520]
Just don't repeat his name.

[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.360]
I won't.

[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.040]
Okay.

[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:25.540]
Okay.

[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.000]
Excellent calls.

[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.960]
Now that we're stimulated this older crowd, it sounds like Joey's audience is tagging along now.

[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:31.780]
W-I-O-D.

[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.280]
It's Bill Marshall.

[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.260]
What is it?

[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:35.840]
Everything's fine.

[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:37.480]
Cuck.

[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:39.460]
Cuck.

[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:39.900]

[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.380]
Cuck.

[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:40.380]

[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.000]
That's the, that's getting close, boy.

[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.520]
His laugh is, you notice he restrained himself in here today, but on Saturday.

[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.380]
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.640]
I can't duplicate it.

[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.200]
It just makes your skin and crawl.

[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:58.180]
It's like somebody is scratching their fingers not on a blackboard, but on your back with real sharp like Elvira's fingernails.

[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.820]
Although I know a lot of you guys are into that.

[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.000]
A West Palm Beach.

[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:01.360]
Hello.

[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:02.740]
Hey, Neil.

[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.420]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.260]
How's it going?

[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:04.740]
Okay.

[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.400]
So baseball's finally going to be played.

[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.200]
Isn't that great?

[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.140]
Isn't that you excited?

[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:09.680]
No.

[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.540]
I'm offended, Neil.

[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:12.300]
What can I say?

[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.620]
I'm offended by what?

[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.900]
Oh, come on.

[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.800]
I mean, you got this crap going on in baseball and now Marino with the dolphins.

[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.140]
Forget about Marino in the dolphins for a while.

[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.040]
Okay, forget about football for a few months.

[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:25.900]
This is baseball.

[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.660]
But it's all the same in pro-span.

[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:28.400]
No, it's not.

[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.860]
It's all big business, but we don't care about that.

[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:31.520]
Oh, come on.

[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.020]
We're victims of our own childishness.

[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.200]
Tennis is lousy.

[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.060]
You got mac and row.

[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:36.620]
You got 30 year olds.

[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:42.260]
Who cares about tennis and about these 13 year old little pimpleheads that they want to make superstars out of?

[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.500]
You know, I figured it out.

[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.560]
Everybody in America is a star for five minutes.

[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:46.200]
Okay.

[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.500]
That's what it's all about.

[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.400]
Everybody's on inside edition and more public for five minutes.

[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.860]
And then they're most of them become obscure.

[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.160]
And now we have another star.

[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.160]
Did you see that?

[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.340]
That ought to be the national anthem looking for a hero.

[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:04.500]
Instead of the star-spangled banner, the people in this country are so into idle worship that it's frightening.

[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.400]
They're going to have a new hero every couple of minutes.

[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:11.300]
And then they want to tear them down and find out something disgusting in their background and then destroy them

[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.240]
and then make a new hero and then destroy them and get another one.

[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:14.620]
Right?

[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:15.480]
Exactly.

[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.480]
Did you catch that golf tournament yesterday?

[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:17.820]
It's disgusting.

[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.060]
Vile Vogueur.

[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:19.600]
What is it?

[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:20.680]
Golf tournament.

[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.620]
Are you crazy?

[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.220]
Oh, come on.

[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:27.200]
While the cubs were playing the Cardinals on WGN, I'm going to watch some stupid guy chasing a ball.

[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.020]
These are real gentlemen.

[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.220]
I'm talking about a real pro sport.

[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.140]
Oh, spare me the pain.

[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.040]
Will you please, sir?

[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.020]
No, seriously.

[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.180]
Real gentlemen.

[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.340]
That's the most boring.

[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.740]
That's not even a sport.

[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:39.400]
Listen to this.

[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.980]
Chasing some little ball around in a silly card.

[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:42.940]
Get out of here.

[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:43.580]
Yesterday.

[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:50.340]
We can go out to win more into the go out to Jack Arrandon, see all these 90-year-old farts chasing around their balls.

[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.720]
They're gentlemen out there.

[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:52.020]

[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.440]
Who cares?

[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.060]
They're gentlemen.

[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:59.460]
They're all got so much money that the skins game and this game, I'll give you a game.

[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.760]
Get out of my life already.

[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.580]
These people are like Nicholas, man.

[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:07.880]
If they were dropping bombs on Palm Beach County, he'd be talking about that short putt.

[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.600]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.680]
I listen to this for gentlemenly.

[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.320]
I'm serious.

[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.000]
That's all these guys care about.

[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.100]
Why don't they retire already?

[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.540]
Give somebody else a chance.

[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.600]
I listen to this, Neil.

[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:20.700]
I can't get hit on these balls.

[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.200]
Like seniors baseball, like these hockey guys.

[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.840]
That was so embarrassing a couple weeks ago when I had that old-timer senior hockey.

[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.260]
I'm not joking.

[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.280]
I couldn't believe it.

[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.320]
I thought it was a joke.

[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.700]
And here they had these old maple leaves out there.

[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.040]
They were clapping along on their skates that could barely stand up and no checking, man.

[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.080]
If they breathed on each other, they would fall down.

[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.320]
Here was the norm all men out there.

[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.380]
He's only 106 in Paul Henderson.

[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.420]
My God.

[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.180]
I know I'm rambling because you got started with a stinkin' golf.

[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:48.760]
It's pork.

[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.080]
I'm trying to say anything to avoid listening to you talk about golf.

[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.340]
But there's only one thing I can do when that's hang up.

[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.520]
1233 at WIOD, right Ron?

[00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.060]
Grapefruit.

[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.800]
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait. Wait. Let's give you the right answer.

[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.620]
Listenin' for fun on the number one sound in town.

[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.680]
The wonderful radio.

[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:07.800]
Sixty one.

[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.940]
That's right. 1233. The home of the jingles right here on A1A.

[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:16.240]
Rossing, John, I had got a little dedication to Ricky Tiggy and Joey Reynolds.

[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.100]
Everybody do it with the WDKR Twins.

[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.960]
All the DJs in the movie too.

[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.740]
The WDKR Twins.

[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.100]
Ron's getting here anyway.

[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.820]
Now this is an ACN, is it?

[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:53.720]
Okay, put him...

[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.080]
Oh, I cut him off. Wait a minute.

[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.280]
Are you still there?

[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.940]
He's still twisting.

[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.500]
Okay, 1234 at WIOD.

[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.860]
It's not on every show in town. You get Ron St. John.

[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.780]
You don't have to listen to magic to get the real Ron, okay folks?

[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.320]
And look at this.

[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.440]
Ron St. John, I hear you have Ron St. John on.

[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.140]
That's right, Rick.

[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.720]
Oh, listen to who this is.

[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.460]
It's Mr. Shine. He's shine.

[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.900]
No, you know. He's calling on the podium.

[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.580]
I left it.

[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.360]
He's doing his Ricky Tiki imitation.

[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.540]
I left it.

[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.600]
I left it up to my buddy Stan.

[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:27.160]
Yeah.

[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.920]
You know, I thought that you got it.

[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.400]
Left it up to your buddy Stan.

[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.200]
I thought I got the message through to you.

[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:32.600]
What?

[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.000]
I had like a real life that week.

[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.860]
I had to work.

[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.600]
What does that have to do with Neil Jr.?

[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.180]
I mean Stan, what does that have to do with him?

[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.920]
Because I left a message with him.

[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.920]
I called him and told him to relay the message.

[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.020]
He didn't relay any message.

[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.480]
Well, that's because he likes to...

[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.580]
The only time he leaves me a message is when it's something morbid and depressing.

[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:54.720]
Oh, God. When I hear his voice on an answering machine, I want to blow my brains up.

[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.360]
Believe me, I would have left.

[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.580]
Probably something sinister and depressing and morbid and really...

[00:24:59.300 --> 00:24:59.940]
Oh, God.

[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:00.940]
More than less of that?

[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:01.340]
Down.

[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.760]
Oh, he makes less of it or seemed like a good humor man.

[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.540]
No, believe me, I would have rather been in there.

[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.840]
You know, you don't start making up stories.

[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.480]
I understand.

[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.640]
You would have been rather been in there.

[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.380]
We didn't need you. We had a bunch of good-looking guys.

[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.640]
I know. I realize this.

[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.400]
By the way, when are we going to start having more of these classes come in here like we did this more?

[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.380]
Now, that was some fun.

[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.360]
I know, I'm serious.

[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.880]
We had a good time here, right?

[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:24.280]
I did.

[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.620]
That was a hell of a time.

[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.200]
That was pretty interesting.

[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.280]
Got a couple of numbers, too.

[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.520]
Not just a little joke.

[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.900]
It's just a joke.

[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.640]
Hey, listen, I was radio-action.

[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.060]
I want to get all those homophobic maniacs hysterical.

[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.900]
I can't even say it. I'm forming it them out.

[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:40.720]
There he is. He's trolling again.

[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:41.560]
He's trolling.

[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.560]
Yeah, it's better to be looking at a dance party at 12-year-old girls on a year, right?

[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:46.580]
That's okay.

[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.260]
I don't read it.

[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:48.560]
I don't know.

[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:49.780]
And not only that, they're all pigs.

[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.200]
They're the ugliest kids I've ever seen in my life.

[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:57.160]
They got about 500 girls and four guys, and all the girls are dancing with each other,

[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:01.120]
and the four guys, they're dancing with each other because they don't want nothing to do with the 500 girls.

[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.020]
They're all little pigs.

[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.220]
They're piglets.

[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:04.920]
Honest to God.

[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.480]
Hey, where's that show from, too?

[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.040]
What's that?

[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:07.640]
Dance party.

[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:08.400]
I have no idea.

[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:09.900]
I think Tallahassee.

[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:10.120]
Yeah.

[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.580]
I had a radio-action the other day.

[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.360]
It's out of Philly.

[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.760]
Oh, that explains it.

[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.660]
Oh, those people in Philly are so ugly.

[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.280]
Woo.

[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.520]
I don't know if you heard this.

[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.220]
I'm sure you did.

[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:20.680]
Like, Joe.

[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.440]
I had a radio-action the other day.

[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.260]
Are you, what are you in slow-mo today?

[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.520]
Are you on doggy downers?

[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.800]
I'm already two minutes over on a break, and you're like, one word at a time.

[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.280]
I'm listening.

[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.800]
I'm listening to the guy that follows you at around five to five.

[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:35.960]
Speaking of shine, yeah.

[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.140]
And he goes to...

[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.020]
And he goes to...

[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.040]
You know, he waxes his head before he comes in here.

[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:40.760]
It's a true story.

[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.500]
He shines up his head.

[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.800]
He goes to the body shine shop before he comes in here.

[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:45.920]
I can't...

[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.580]
Anyway, David.

[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.820]
Have you ever heard of Nusson's like Mount Everest?

[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:49.320]
What is it?

[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.540]
I'm not a gylimatic auto.

[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.140]
You ever heard him go to his Tommy traffic thing?

[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.280]
Yeah, when he goes to the traffic.

[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.780]
No, well, it's always awkward.

[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.720]
It's never like...

[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.680]
There's never a transition.

[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.540]
Tom always comes on like, oh, okay.

[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.520]
I can see my own.

[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:01.940]
Exactly.

[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.440]
Oh, that's what it's supposed to be.

[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.500]
It's like a fumbling, bumbling...

[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.900]
Like Friday, it was like 10-2.

[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.840]
Do you have any idea how long the last break in this hour is going to be?

[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.380]
If you don't get to the point, we're going to be like an Allen.

[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.460]
Burke, 9-minute break.

[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.000]
All right, all right.

[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.020]
All right, let me...

[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.100]
He goes to Tommy traffic and he wasn't ready.

[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.820]
So there's like a minute of dead air.

[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.020]
And then all of a sudden, you hear Tom Roberts come on.

[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.260]
He doesn't think he's on the air.

[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:27.540]
We've got an important hernia center spot standing by here and you're patching around.

[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.440]
And Tom Roberts comes on.

[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:30.500]
He doesn't think he's on the air.

[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.000]
He thinks he's talking to the program director or whatever.

[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.240]
And he goes, let's forget about...

[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:35.840]
Oh, I heard that.

[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:36.420]
Yeah, I heard it.

[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.000]
That's when I was listening.

[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.100]
Surely after the ripping of ACN and Mark Mosley.

[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.060]
How was quite interesting.

[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:42.900]
Well, you know that.

[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.440]
Well, you're a no-talent too, okay?

[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.220]
How do you like that?

[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.220]
I know, I do those...

[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.700]
All those stupid song parodies.

[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.080]
You don't even sound like Elvis.

[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:49.620]
You suck.

[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:50.760]
Yeah, I do.

[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.900]
Take a few lessons from Eric Lambert, okay?

[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.040]
The attack of the stand-up comment.

[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.660]
You can grow some hair and be a chronic pain in the ass too.

[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.580]
And so that's going to be a movie, the attack of the stand-up comment.

[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:01.740]
Good day.

[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:02.660]
Take care.

[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.640]
22-till-a-one at WIOD.

[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.620]
610-cub-d-i-on-d.

[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.780]
Oh, no.

[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.280]
Now, not another one of these.

[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.800]
Oh, scary tales can come true.

[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.040]
It can happen to you.

[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.840]
If you're carry-haw.

[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.820]
Well, that's Wica, that's bad.

[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.660]
While the white dwarf is away.

[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.800]
In the townhouse you play.

[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.340]
If you're carry-haw.

[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.640]
I'd rather sing a little bit for you today like that old black magic.

[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.780]
A big price you'll pay.

[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.960]
It with a weapon you play.

[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.540]
Not once, it was twice.

[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.760]
You were caught with misrides.

[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.220]
Has me in a spin.

[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.980]
You're really not too smart.

[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.800]
If you can't stay apart.

[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.720]
Now you won't be president.

[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.440]
Carry heart.

[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.380]
You won't be the president.

[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:11.020]
No.

[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.580]
Carry heart.

[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.660]
Ah, guys, every day.

[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.900]
I didn't even have to tune in.

[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.080]
I heard the show yesterday.

[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.440]
Same old douching in the same old talking.

[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.320]
Come on, give us a breath.

[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.280]
Same old song parodies.

[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.400]
1243 at W.I.D.

[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.680]
Here's the collar in Hollywood with these joys funny.

[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.560]
Boy, it's amazing that Bill got to a pay phone so fast.

[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:37.880]
How you doing, Bill?

[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.000]
Oh, Bill's even changing his voice now.

[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.400]
First time I ever heard Joey Reynolds with yesterday.

[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.460]
Well, that's funny because he's not on.

[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.460]
He's not on yesterday.

[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:50.420]
Okay.

[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.260]
I listen to you all the time.

[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.060]
So I get to hear you all the time.

[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.860]
Can I ask you what kind of phone this is?

[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.800]
Well, it's a Southern bad phone.

[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.940]
It's a Southern Baptist phone.

[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:02.660]
Southern bad phone.

[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:03.980]
Boy, this phone don't have a prayer.

[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:04.660]
I'll tell you that.

[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:05.720]
Listen to the quality.

[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:06.160]
Woo!

[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.280]
Sounds like you've got 14 Nylons over the phone.

[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.180]
Can you hear me?

[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.260]
Well, I can hear you, but it's real muffled.

[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:13.740]
Okay.

[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.160]
I'll try to speak louder.

[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:15.680]
Boy.

[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.540]
Anyway, so I finally heard him say it at all.

[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.760]
I had his voice and I thought it was funny.

[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.080]
Yeah.

[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.360]
I don't know.

[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:23.980]
I don't know what's going with him.

[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.000]
He's, I don't either.

[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.340]
I've been trying to figure it out for 30 years since he was a kid.

[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:29.040]
I'm not that bad.

[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:29.600]
And I wanted it.

[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:35.480]
You know that bit you just said about the old lady that, uh, you know, I have the same old thing.

[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:35.840]
Yeah.

[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.840]
She sounds just like Ruth Gordon.

[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.220]
It is Ruth Gordon.

[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:39.900]
Is it?

[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:40.320]
Yeah.

[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:40.860]
Uh.

[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.380]
No, it's Jack Gordon.

[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.680]
Well, he sounds just like...

[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.140]
Well, he's right.

[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:44.600]
What are you doing?

[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.020]
No, no.

[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.160]
It's nice and cold in here.

[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.540]
Melvin, don't turn it up.

[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.820]
Then you'll get, once his name out here, he'll turn it down to 50.

[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.140]
I like it nice and freezing.

[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.760]
I want to get pneumonia so I can take a couple weeks off.

[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:56.640]
Right?

[00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:58.500]
Hello?

[00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.100]
Hello?

[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.660]
This is the first time I ever called you.

[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:02.400]
Well, it's okay.

[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.800]
You'll notice that when you call it, it's like four different conversations.

[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:06.400]
Okay.

[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.620]
I also think Ruth and Fred do it for me.

[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.080]
Yeah.

[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.580]
Well, look, at least you're consistent.

[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.760]
And I think Eric Bennett is kind of, he talks about the same thing all the time.

[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.060]
He talks about what?

[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:20.840]
Oh.

[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:21.640]
Everything.

[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:25.600]
Well, that's because he can't remember what it's like he's trying to keep the memory alive.

[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:27.380]
Okay.

[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:28.220]
Okay.

[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:28.800]
Have a nice one.

[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:29.420]
Get a new phone.

[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.500]
Okay, that is the worst phone I've ever heard in my life.

[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:33.960]
Yeah, let's try it.

[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.840]
It's 12.45, those phones are not coming on too well.

[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.660]
It's 12.45 a.1 a.m.

[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:39.980]
We got all the cheekbones you have in one ear.

[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.600]
Tone it down a little, Ron.

[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.260]
Let's speak about some old guy now.

[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:45.880]
Overmodulating, Ron.

[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.560]
Oh.

[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:50.820]
Everybody's got this.

[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.840]
We're going, we're going.

[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.320]
We're making, we're going.

[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.520]
We're going, we're going.

[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:02.800]
Okay, good job, Ron.

[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.680]
It's 12.45 at WIOD and let's go to Miami.

[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.240]
Hello.

[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:07.980]
Neil.

[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:09.500]
Look at this here, Aldi.

[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.780]
Rochester, Amher, coaches in their records starting with Joe Crozier and Rudy Migue.

[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.680]
And Steve Kraftcheck.

[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:20.200]
And they even have the roster for Rochester and Buffalo and the American Hockey League.

[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.160]
Isn't that exciting, sir?

[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:21.900]
Neil.

[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.060]
There's Geet Trotje.

[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:23.920]
Hello.

[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:24.780]
And Ron Ingram.

[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:25.920]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:26.320]
Go ahead.

[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.320]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.260]
Okay.

[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:29.040]
Okay.

[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:32.020]
Neil, first to get something out of the way here.

[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.900]
Johnny Bohatch, Jose and Julie are all bunch of douchebags.

[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:36.360]
Okay.

[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:37.040]
Number two.

[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:37.940]
There's Ron Outwell.

[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:38.980]
Yeah.

[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:39.880]
Dennis Hextal.

[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.100]
Number two.

[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.040]
Ronco Horvath.

[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.700]
Uh, spy reporter from Gilbert.

[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.920]
You don't know where I saw him.

[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.140]
I'm afraid to ask.

[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:50.480]
I have a softball game.

[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:51.300]
Uh-huh.

[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.120]
He plays softball one of the guys here at work.

[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:53.780]
Great.

[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.420]
Well, he seems to play ball with all the guys.

[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:56.800]
Yeah.

[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.100]
If he catch my drift, sir.

[00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.940]
But he doesn't get into the game too much.

[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:00.620]
Mm-hmm.

[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.100]
Nope.

[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.100]
I think he plays the field.

[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.040]
And I saw his mom in the game.

[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:07.700]
Uh-huh.

[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.360]
She showed up with a fur coat.

[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:10.360]
Great.

[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.740]
With 80-degree weather.

[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:13.320]
Well, that's what you get.

[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:13.920]
Yep.

[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.200]
Anyways.

[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:16.740]
Is that it?

[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:17.640]
That's it, Neil.

[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.220]
Oh, I bring back Bill Marshall.

[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:19.860]
Yeah.

[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.860]
Have a great day, sir.

[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:22.200]
Okay.

[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.160]
Oh, what a call.

[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:24.360]
1247 at WIOD.

[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.560]
Let's go to...

[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.060]
Hi, Alia.

[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.260]
I got one.

[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.360]
I can't help it.

[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:30.620]

[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:31.640]
Yeah, good.

[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:32.440]
Go back to sleep.

[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:33.920]
Let's go to Boca.

[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:34.240]
Hello.

[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:35.980]
Boca.

[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:36.960]
Go on.

[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.580]
No obling lace?

[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:39.760]
Adios.

[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.060]
Miami.

[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.560]
Oh.

[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:43.040]
Yeah.

[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:45.420]
Yes.

[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.080]
Hello.

[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.960]
That must be from Homestead.

[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:54.800]
Can you believe that?

[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.380]
Here's a lady in plantation.

[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:57.200]
Neil.

[00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.980]
Who wonders what this is all about?

[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.120]
You got that right.

[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.720]
Friend Healy and Ralph Kiner.

[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.780]
Oh, God.

[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.380]
Friend Healy.

[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.740]
Friend Healy giving new meaning to the word illiterate.

[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:09.740]

[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:09.740]

[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:09.740]

[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.380]
I just can't believe that man.

[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.000]
He is...

[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.040]
He makes Kiner...

[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:13.500]
You beg.

[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:15.960]
You pray for Kiner to come back on the game.

[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:16.880]
And that's saying a lot.

[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:17.860]
That's right.

[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.200]
Oh, friend Healy, I'd forgotten all about him.

[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.460]
That's why I'm dover.

[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:22.060]
Oh.

[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.600]
Yeah, how could you forget about him, guy?

[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.580]
Well, of course, Le Grand Orange.

[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:27.140]
Don't forget about Rusty Stab,

[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.820]
who's busy cooking gourmet cuisine in the kitchen right now.

[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:31.340]
Oysters Rusty.

[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.080]
And I wonder who's in the kitchen with Rusty,

[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.080]
but that's another story.

[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:34.480]
What a rope.

[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.660]
We'll ask Steve Thone.

[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.620]
He'll probably tell us.

[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:38.580]
Thanks, O.

[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:39.700]
I know so.

[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.140]
Really?

[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.060]
Believe me.

[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:41.820]
How much is that, that?

[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.220]
No, ma'am.

[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.700]
Steve Thone is Jewish.

[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:46.340]
Did you know that?

[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.820]
Among other things?

[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:49.880]
Yeah, I did not.

[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:50.360]
He's great.

[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:51.280]
He's okay in my book.

[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.900]
He keeps Harry on these straight and narrow paths.

[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:56.040]
Or at least part of that.

[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.140]
Harry's a great guy.

[00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:57.560]
He is.

[00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.560]
So anyway, in closing.

[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.020]
Anyway, one thing before I go.

[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.200]
If Alex Minnett is in Manage's Word,

[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.060]
and he's leaving, he says he is.

[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:08.820]
He's not going anywhere.

[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.140]
They'll call her in my radio.

[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:10.900]
Two to three.

[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:11.960]
He's not going anywhere.

[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:12.700]
Don't you understand?

[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.980]
He's just putting on that sympathy act.

[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.800]
Like you're picking on me and cutting it out.

[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.520]
And if you don't stop, I'm going to leave.

[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.160]
I'm okay.

[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.060]
Like a little petulant child.

[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.220]
You know, he's not going anywhere.

[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:22.740]
Really?

[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:23.380]
No.

[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.380]
Well, anyway, in closing to that.

[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:26.820]
Lovely way.

[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.240]
If he ever left us, how would we know what good taste was?

[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.640]
We wouldn't know how to dress or what to eat,

[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.740]
or what to listen to, or what to watch,

[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.740]
or what movies to go to.

[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.800]
He's terminal meal.

[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.200]
I tried.

[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.080]
I gave him a shot.

[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.740]
Well, we're going to drive him down to the bus terminals,

[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.940]
as a matter of fact, a little later on,

[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.340]
and see if he gets the hint.

[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.540]
Now, he's okay.

[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.420]
He's just a pain in the end.

[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:51.140]
He's not sad at all.

[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.020]
But he's so during the weakest.

[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.420]
Well, that's because he's got those 9 or 10 dunderheads in here,

[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.680]
and he does the whole show for them.

[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.480]
Have you ever noticed?

[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.280]
What was the show I was watching the other day?

[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.960]
Oh, it's that amazing discoveries.

[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.740]
Have you seen that?

[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.460]
Oh, with the setting, the car on fire,

[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.700]
and their washing, their hands, and their body parts,

[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.440]
and selling these products,

[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.900]
and they have that phony, live studio audience.

[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.200]
Then they give you the offer.

[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:22.020]
No more, more, we want more.

[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.300]
This is the new thing in America now.

[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.780]
Everybody will act like a hyena.

[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.080]
It really started on a more downy junior show,

[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.580]
when he had all these animals in there from the Bronx going,

[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.740]
and he was like, oh, oh, oh.

[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.940]
That's all loaded in the producer, I think.

[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:34.880]
Like, what is it?

[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.500]
The all loaded in the producer.

[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:36.920]
Yeah.

[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.820]
Or they pay, I think they pay him off is what it is.

[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:40.620]
They have to.

[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.520]
Absolutely.

[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:43.560]
And that's what we have basically in here,

[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:44.900]
no matter what's going on,

[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:45.500]
it's like, wow!

[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.520]
You know, I just, I don't know.

[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.340]
He's live studio audiences, man.

okay they have they have a song

[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.360]
and Ron St. John Jr. actually played this

[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:48.800]
and if you play it sometime you'll notice that they actually say instead of memories

[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.220]
they actually say memories

[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:51.020]

[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.680]
what the hell kind of crap is that?

[00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.140]
well I mean memories

[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:02.480]

[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.140]

[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.500]

[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.940]

I wish he was in the stand so he could choke

[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:35.400]
I bet your manage took six showers during that game

[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.460]

[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:38.820]

okay don't keep asking the same question Joel

[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.520]
I'm sorry I'm a little bit nervous

[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:48.380]
because you have nothing to say don't keep saying how's everything

[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.720]
I say okay and then you ask it again and the audience is saying

[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.780]
geez God

[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:52.480]
I was a little nervous

[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:53.260]
what is this?

[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:53.920]
I just want to

[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.600]
Howard Stern would never talk to somebody you talk like that

[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:57.420]
that's true that's true

[00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:00.480]
this people have to have the IQ of an Australian pig me

[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.280]
I think we're doing great

[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.520]
I'm an aborigini

[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.080]
I want to have a koala bear

[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.360]
I wanted to comment on that

[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.380]
Bill character from the Joey Reynolds show

[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:08.880]
oh man was that exciting?

[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.460]
I was doing great till he came in the whole show has gone down

[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:12.100]
Hilsen's though

[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.920]
for me he's like the Ed McMahon Jr

[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.900]
they say anything and he's cracking up in the background all the time

[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:20.580]
but he has that herniatic laugh he got to go to the herniest center out on you

[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:24.460]
ugly laugh and he is that wild herniatic is stare

[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:25.260]
yeah

[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:28.500]
and nothing funny that they say nothing at all is funny

[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.740]
and they laugh like it was like the last thing

[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:33.880]
well it's one thing I wouldn't be called dead having somebody sitting in cackling

[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.140]
in the background of my show

[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:37.180]
that for sure not even you're right

[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.900]
yeah by the way Chuck Myers on the weekend

[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:44.420]
he is great I like he's a great he's a good talent man

[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:47.900]
how he ever wound up at this radio station is one of the great mysteries of all time

[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.720]
he was a great newsman he's got a gift to gab

[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.680]
he knows a lot about sports and about news and about anything

[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.400]
he can talk he can speak

[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.980]
he's showing Saturdays I enjoy it

[00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:58.340]
doesn't take any crap from anybody

[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:01.260]
he does play a lot of my cards though I noticed that but that's okay

[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:04.920]

115 at W.I.O.D. we have an opening in date where Joel just hung up

[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:37.360]
Joel's taking grammar lessons from Luther's skywalker I think

[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:40.960]
Luke what is his name Luke skywalker I doesn't really make any difference

[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.680]
what do you call him that's still the same end result and if Michael

[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:46.520]
Putney is listening or anybody who knows Mike I want to say it again

[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:49.600]

[00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.760]

hard to get out to the clubs and the well you'd be great on the Alex

[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:52.220]
Benichoke because he hasn't done it quite a while either by the way speaking of

[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:56.920]

[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:09.320]
I'm gonna have no doubt no don't do it don't do it no we have don't leave me

[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:13.960]
along with this man we have number 10 sucking long Reynolds family tradition

[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:18.400]
number nine Joey Lister's have habit of not wearing dentures when calling in

[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:22.780]
number eight constant cletching about soaring prices of laxatives in

[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:27.600]
Canada number seven nine out of ten doctors prefer Joey Reynolds show to

[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:31.900]

three lengthy discussions of sex with Yenthas number two continually daydreams

[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:52.580]
out loud I could have been heraldo and the number one reason of the Joey Reynolds

[00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:57.200]
show sucking is slam some of sexuality because of deep guilt over secretly

[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:02.940]
wearing bra and panties on the air miss one with young lucky and there they are

[00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:09.120]
yeah there they are for your perusal and amusement ladies and gentlemen let's

[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.000]

the show is he'll have a he'll have a guy on that he'll say that is really funny

[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:32.900]

the studio or whatever too many guests at one time you'll never hear the guy say

[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:40.380]

a little p.o. I'll make it short and sweet okay when you're talking to the

[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.280]
about the garbage in your yard I got a great idea you got to do from now on when

[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.440]
you move to new area like that you got to interview everybody in a neighborhood

[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.560]
make sure that's where you want to live yeah I mean that's the bottom line you

[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.700]
got to interview you know what they're like and what they don't like what you

[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.460]
realize that you'd be living in a pup tent if you did that in this town you

[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:16.500]
never move anywhere because they all hate each other well I mean I'm not kidding

[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:20.640]
man my neighbors they all and not just little stories I mean venomous stories

[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.640]
like I don't want to see your ugly face I'm gonna build a fence they hate each

[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:29.520]
other like poison well that's true most stuff Florida but anyway a friend

[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:33.260]

[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:07.840]
bottom line is a grumpy old guy well what can you do it doesn't have a sense of

[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:11.520]
humor he takes everything personally and he starts attacking and leash it

[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:17.020]
lashing and leashing out that's because he just got attacking ACN satire and

[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:20.840]
song parodies and then all those other interpretable marks he made that I

[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:26.300]

[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:52.100]
critique there and that includes the people who call in who who just think all
