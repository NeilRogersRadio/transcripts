[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]
This is the Neal Roger show.

[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.700]
This is your brain.

[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.600]
Any question?

[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.020]
Yeah, lots.

[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.060]
Anyway, it's 10.07 at WIV, just like old times.

[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.880]
It's just a boy, you just wait.

[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.840]
Just wait a few days.

[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.700]
We're going to be rekindling all those old memories.

[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.480]
I forgot, by the way, to bring in the Dick Purtentape.

[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.980]
So the two pinheads that called in yesterday

[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.720]
that were just desperate to hear that again.

[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.660]
You have to wait till tomorrow.

[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.880]
You'll have to wait till I remember to bring in the cassette.

[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.040]
When I'm good and ready to bring it in, that's when you'll hear it.

[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.400]
Okay?

[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.980]
When the dog barks and says,

[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.720]
Hey, bring the cassette, dummy.

[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.280]
That's when I'll remember to bring it in.

[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.140]
Anyway, we have something unusual today.

[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.060]
We have open phones from 10 to 2.

[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.180]
And Richard Simmons, one of my,

[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.000]
oh, I have such ambivalent feelings about him,

[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.260]
like I do about most people.

[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.500]
Because most people are at least 50% full of crap.

[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.460]
I think you'll discover that way as you go through life.

[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.920]
And Richard had been on my show many, many times,

[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.120]
until a time that he practically strangled me

[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.160]
with an affectionate love grip on my neck.

[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.800]
He's not as bad as Joey.

[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.800]
At least he doesn't kiss,

[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.260]
at least not on the first August appearance anyway.

[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.080]
But he put his, came up from behind me

[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.720]
and put his hands around my neck

[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.680]
and got ahold of my larynx

[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.020]
and just about crushed my voice box,

[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.140]
which would have been the end of me.

[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.380]
But anyway, he's getting fat too, by the way.

[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.980]
Have you seen him lately?

[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.060]
He is putting on the pounds, man.

[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.280]
He is really doing it.

[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.020]
But he'll be on, I think, by phone, right?

[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.900]
I pray.

[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.960]
Oh, I hope he's not going to be in a building.

[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.500]
Because if he is, he'll come in here again

[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.040]
and start smoothing up to me.

[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.500]
And I can't, he's not my type, Richard.

[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.940]
I'm sorry.

[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.220]
I don't think you're anybody's type.

[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.600]
He's going to talk about his predictions for the 90s.

[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.440]
Also, from WLRN's off the beaten path.

[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.540]
Can we say that comes Bob Slade.

[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.780]
Oh, my God, look at this.

[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.300]
And representatives from WKPX,

[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.660]
Piper Radio will be here to talk new music and music radio.

[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.440]
And talk a lot about Elvis Costello and the Ramones, no doubt.

[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.380]
On the Alex Penicillus.

[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.220]
So we got a lot of stuff coming up later.

[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.960]
Nothing now.

[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.180]
We have nothing now.

[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.640]
Just the four hours.

[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.560]
I was going to go into a big song

[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.600]
and a dance today about my satellite dish

[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.460]
and about my neighbors that I mentioned yesterday.

[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.060]
And why is it that people, neighbors in this town suck so bad.

[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.920]
They're just brutal.

[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.640]
They're nasty.

[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.320]
They're hostile.

[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.880]
And also the city of plantation lied through their teeth to me.

[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.120]
I don't want to mention any names on the air, but they lied.

[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.760]
And now they're sending me a notice, a citation.

[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.720]
We're just like back where I started two years ago.

[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.800]
The same crap with the satellite dish.

[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.800]
And the bottom line is, they're afraid that you're going to see something

[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.700]
that they can't see and you're going to have a good time,

[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.680]
which is against the law.

[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.940]
And secondly, the cable company just want to make it as difficult as possible.

[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.680]
I have continental implantation and they have got to be one of the worst.

[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.580]
They won't give us GN.

[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.660]
See, because all these cable companies are in bed with Ted Turner.

[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.680]
They get a special deal because they got the CNN and headline news.

[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.780]
And the TNT, which is a piece of crap.

[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.320]
Did you hear Alex say yesterday TNT was one of his favorites?

[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.300]
I can't believe anybody watches TNT.

[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.440]
All those old washed out 40s movies they put on there.

[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.980]
I've crap.

[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.520]
Nobody watches TNT.

[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.200]
But anyway, in exchange for getting all of that at a reduced price,

[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.380]
they carry WTBS, which nobody, unless you want to see green acres,

[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.740]
nobody wants to see WTBS because the only thing they have of interest

[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.480]
is the braves.

[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.000]
And they're only about six people interested in the braves,

[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.080]
plus a couple of perverts who want to see Dale Murphy.

[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.540]
And that's about it.

[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.660]
And we could have WGN, but instead we get stuck with that.

[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.340]
And of course, we don't have sports channel either.

[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.240]
So if you got continental, you really are screwed badly, badly.

[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.360]
And that's the name of the game.

[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.700]
So the city of plantation, a special salute,

[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.760]
may you may not be good, but at least you're consistent.

[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.160]
You're consistently full of crap.

[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.400]
You're like a bunch of little dictators over there.

[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.340]
And all you want to do is make everybody's life as miserable as possible

[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.040]
like your $16 of box plantation bags, which I hope,

[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.980]
I hope that each one of the city commissioners in plantation

[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.980]
wakes up one morning with a blue garbage bag around his head, okay?

[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.540]
We just a few holes in it so that they're still breathing.

[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.780]
Barely.

[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.080]
Boy, you people make me sick.

[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.360]
Man, do things that are not in any way bothering anybody else

[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.760]
or at least shouldn't be, and it doesn't make a bit of difference.

[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.540]
Just a hopeless, same old crap.

[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.020]
You don't want to be bored with that, do you?

[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.480]
You don't want to hear that same old crap.

[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.940]
You don't want to hear me cletching on the air.

[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.300]
You've heard it a million times before.

[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.040]
And that's it.

[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.660]
You don't like it.

[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.740]
Get the hell out of here, right?

[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.540]
You don't like it.

[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.840]
Leave.

[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.280]
That's it.

[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.560]
Never going to change.

[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.060]
It sucks.

[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.420]
That's the way they want it.

[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.860]
They don't watch you seeing all that sports and all those movies

[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:44.880]
and having a good time.

[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.980]
And American ecstasy once in a while too, just for variety.

[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.860]
Now, that's old stuff on there, boy.

[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.760]
They even have run Jeremy movies on there.

[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.020]
He looks just like Al Goldstein.

[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.720]
I got a incredible letter, which I think I'll read,

[00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.860]
because I got nothing going today.

[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.620]
It's Tuesday tomorrow.

[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.820]
We got our big, remote, it's spec.

[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.900]
So I'm just kind of laying low today,

[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.280]
getting ready for tomorrow's big extravaganza.

[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.480]
Joey's going to be stopping by and Rick and Puts.

[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.620]
And Fat Rich will be there.

[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.860]
A force feeding food down his throat that he doesn't even want

[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.860]
just to be a nice guy.

[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.600]
Right?

[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.160]
Anyway, I got an incredible letter from Al Goldstein.

[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.620]
He is obsessed with this show.

[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.840]
He's just obsessed.

[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.440]
And a copy of the latest screw magazine.

[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.360]
Maybe we should read some of the columns.

[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.120]
The name of some of the columns from screw.

[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.880]
That'll get the license in about five minutes, okay?

[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.880]
Well, here's one.

[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.600]
We can read this.

[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.820]
It's called Not A Peep.

[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.240]
Rag Queens.

[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.380]
Papal smear.

[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.480]
Prank and file.

[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.720]
Not these are pretty, there's one here that I'm not going to say.

[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.380]
Limps something.

[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.380]
I'm not going to read what it says.

[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.340]
Anyway, 13 past 10 at WIOD.

[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.460]
And, oh, you just don't listen to it.

[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.260]
Well, anyway, congratulations to Cheryl and Mitch,

[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.140]
who over the weekend.

[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.880]
Where did you go?

[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.440]
Nowhere.

[00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.360]
Is that a secret?

[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.420]
Okay, they got married, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.580]
And we wish them the best.

[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.240]
They're just two wonderful human beings.

[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.360]
It's a match made in heaven.

[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.200]
And I don't say that's sarcastically.

[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.820]
I say that.

[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.000]
It's just a wonderful match.

[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.760]
It's one of those rare occasions when two perfectly matched people in temperament and taste, etc.

[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.180]
Have Wade and Holy Matrimony.

[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.080]
And they're taking up the office pool right now.

[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.600]
Okay, now what is that?

[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.420]
That looks pretty good.

[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.200]
That's not a bigel.

[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.140]
That's an onion roll, right?

[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.600]
Thank you, Paul.

[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.880]
Paul over at Bagels & Co.

[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.680]
He sent the little stuff here this morning.

[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.960]
Well, that's what?

[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.820]
Vegetable cream cheese, isn't that great?

[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.980]
It's not even drafe.

[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.420]
Look at that.

[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.000]
It's great.

[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.940]
It's kosher for suckers.

[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.820]
I don't know why suckers always comes to my mind.

[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.020]
That's because it's the eating holiday.

[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.620]
I mean, pass over you have a little satyr,

[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.020]
but suckers is like the festival of eating, of picking out.

[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.960]
That riches ancestors must have started that holiday.

[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.880]
Look at that.

[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.520]
It's all sliced with all those nice onions.

[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.780]
Now, are you doing that for me?

[00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.080]
Oh, thank you.

[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.200]
I was getting a little nervous.

[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.400]
Anyway, it's 10, 17, and W.I.

[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.000]
A day later, I'll read Al Goldstein's,

[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.800]
the letter Al is obsessed with this show.

[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.940]
Boy, he just, I think Al is in love with me.

[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.620]
I'm nervous about that, because he signs it with love and kisses Al.

[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.800]
And I'm not, have you seen him lately?

[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.100]
Cheryl, have you seen Al Goldstein lately?

[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.400]
Mount Vesuvius on a bad day.

[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.880]
Gotta go on a diet first, Al, and lose about 100 pounds in 100 years.

[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.720]
Let's go to Margate for a wonderful call.

[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.020]
Hello.

[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.020]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.440]
Great.

[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.800]
Hey, I got something, uh, pot that you did.

[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:33.920]
I bet you did.

[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.900]
About the Super Bowl.

[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.520]
It's the best time to go out to a restaurant.

[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:38.700]
Uh-huh.

[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.920]
Went to the pot Sunday.

[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.820]
You went to the pot?

[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:41.480]
Yes, great.

[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.840]
Around a lot of our listeners who spent a lot of time at the pot.

[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.600]
It was great.

[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:45.760]
Did my banana?

[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:46.680]
Yeah.

[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.420]
It was unbelievable.

[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.120]
Great.

[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.440]
Another thing I want to talk about is...

[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.940]
You do realize that there's no melting pot in plantation, don't you?

[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.960]
It's too good for plantations against the law.

[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.200]
In fact, I don't even know how quirky snake didn't.

[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.280]
It's right, anything good there.

[00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.180]
They knew how good that was.

[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.040]
They'd probably close them up by Friday.

[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.540]
Well, they got a good sound, body bags and plantation.

[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.020]
I don't want to sound bitter in hostile, but I am.

[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.280]
So you moved, huh?

[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:07.920]
Mm-hmm.

[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:08.440]
Yeah.

[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.560]
You still live in a different ranch?

[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.360]
Do you still in Jacarana?

[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:11.720]
No.

[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.080]
I don't discuss where I live on the Irrister.

[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.120]
I mean, are you a reinsurge or what?

[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.640]
You want me to give the address on the Irr?

[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.260]
I can come cruising by your house.

[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.380]
And by the way, Marcy, who lives in my complex, who's called yesterday,

[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.740]
she's called a couple of times.

[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.420]
It didn't dawn on me.

[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.620]
I was just thinking about this.

[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.020]
Thank you.

[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.240]
I was just thinking about this.

[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.920]
But remember, she said yesterday, were you listening?

[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.040]
Mm-hmm.

[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.820]
You don't know what I'm talking about.

[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.800]
She said that when the inspector from plantation came evidently

[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.440]
to look at the did.

[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.080]
Yeah, the car.

[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.220]
He was looking at the Ferrari.

[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.360]
Well, she doesn't live in the same part of the complex that I do.

[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.380]
So unless she's a super yenta, how does she know what he was looking at?

[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.540]
Unless he's kind of like hanging out the house being a little inspector?

[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:50.600]
Yeah.

[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:51.340]
Well, you know what?

[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.420]
What a bunch of yentas in this town, man.

[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.700]
You build that garbage bag up.

[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:55.440]
Mm-hmm.

[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.680]
You guys get the ACN tapes?

[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:57.900]
I beg your pardon?

[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.940]
Did you guys get the ACN tapes?

[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.260]
We don't discuss these things here until we're ready to discuss them, okay?

[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.020]
Well, you play...

[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.560]
You're just an awful pushy today.

[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.660]
You're an awful, well, listen.

[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.040]
We're just giving you a little taste.

[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.720]
You're just giving a little taste.

[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.000]
You're playing Stevie Nade.

[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.280]
And here what I just said, we're giving you a little taste.

[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.220]
I want a big taste.

[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.200]
I'll give you a taste.

[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.120]
It's 10.19 at W.I.A.

[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.860]
That was our first friendly call of the morning.

[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.820]
And that should give you visitors a real good idea what this town is all about.

[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.380]
Get out before it's too late, okay?

[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.520]
Get on the bus.

[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.800]
And go back where you came from.

[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.180]
This is a little, this is good, but it's heavy.

[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.440]
I mean, I don't think you're supposed to make a sandwich out of it.

[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:33.420]
Huh?

[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.160]
No, you're not.

[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.120]
It's too much, too much.

[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.460]
And I got to go to mommy's today.

[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.820]
This is just, um...

[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.020]
No, I'm having some orange juice.

[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.120]
And I have a little bit of this.

[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:43.720]
A little taste.

[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.180]
It's good.

[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.080]
It's delicious.

[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:47.560]
Mm.

[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.000]
If you could eat that whole thing, then you'd start gaining some weight.

[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.320]
Then you could look like Alice Goldstein at about 10 weeks.

[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.080]
Here's a mobile and four-letter deal.

[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:58.260]
Hello.

[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:58.940]
I don't know.

[00:09:59.100 --> 00:09:59.380]
Okay.

[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.960]
Listen, everybody sounds like an inspector gadget.

[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:03.680]
Yeah.

[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.740]
And you're in your place.

[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.160]
I anyway...

[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.460]
I had a nightmare this morning.

[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.940]
I woke up, I put the dogs down, I went back to sleep,

[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.560]
and I had a nightmare about the homeowners association they came.

[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.160]
No, seriously, and all these weird people came in and were inspecting my house

[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.540]
and for some reason there was all this mud all over the floor.

[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.320]
Probably with a magnifying glass, too, right?

[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:21.520]
Yeah.

[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:22.260]
Jesus.

[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.460]
Anyway, I find...

[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.060]
I think most of them need a magnifying glass.

[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.900]
Well, I'm starving.

[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.780]
I've been eating all day since 5 o'clock this morning.

[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:31.220]
Why?

[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.160]
And I'm just hungry.

[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.200]
And I'm going over to quirky now,

[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.640]
and I'm going to cleanse my palate over there.

[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:35.900]
Good.

[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.400]
Excellent.

[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.160]
And I some matter of fact right now, I'm on my way there.

[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.780]
And the other thing I was going to tell you,

[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.040]
I didn't get to call you yesterday,

[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.340]
but it was through a super bowl day.

[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.320]
I ate like an animal.

[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.820]
I felt like I was ESP.

[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.660]
I was having Tony the Tiger also.

[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.580]
I ate all day long.

[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:50.740]
All day long, I had...

[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.180]
But you talked about frosted flakes.

[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.300]
I didn't gain any weight.

[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.420]
I was too nervous to get on the scale yesterday.

[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:55.720]
Really?

[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.560]
So I got on this morning, and I did him the same.

[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.220]
I didn't gain any weight, which I don't know how.

[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:01.380]
But I had too many...

[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.080]
Wait a minute, look at that Bob Barker is on Sally Jesse,

[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.260]
and he's wearing a mint coat.

[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.180]
I can't believe it.

[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.440]
Yeah, but it's probably made from artificial flavorings and dye number three and stuff like that.

[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:11.280]
Good.

[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.880]
I hope it gets seeps into his pores and it comes out in his hair.

[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.620]
I hope that when they put him in a cascadise,

[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.920]
dies his blinded mink.

[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.980]
I hope his hair looks like a chipmunk tomorrow on the praces, right?

[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.960]
I like Bob Barker, but he's a little too cozy with those animals, you know?

[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:25.800]
Take it a little too serious.

[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.520]
Yeah, he shouldn't take it that serious.

[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:27.940]
That's right.

[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.820]
Anyway, I'd like to call all those people and inspect your house and plant taking a bunch of douchebag, including that marshy.

[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:33.640]
Okay.

[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.060]
Okay.

[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.320]
I have a great lunch.

[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:35.740]
The chew butt.

[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:36.120]
Bye.

[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.100]
Well, this is delicious.

[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.160]
It's an onion...

[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:40.720]
Not a roll.

[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.140]
I don't know what the hell it is.

[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:49.100]
It's like an all-long onion thing with vegetable cream cheese inside.

[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.320]
And Cheryl made a big sandwich out of it and it's disgusting.

[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.080]
It's just too big.

[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.100]
Too big, Cheryl.

[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.160]
What do you want, Henry?

[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:55.800]
That's good.

[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.820]
No, it's Chateau-la Crap.

[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:01.700]
It's not too full.

[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.200]
Yeah.

[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.320]
22 past 10 at W.O.D., we still have a couple of open lines in Dade County.

[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.680]
They're not too sociable this morning.

[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.100]
Boken, Palm Beach, you're still wondering what the topic is.

[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.120]
751 W.O.D., now that's...

[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.020]
A B.A.L.E.

[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.380]
Isn't it a flat...

[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.020]
It's hard to tell.

[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:17.700]
I can't tell.

[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.280]
It's also loaded with onions.

[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.360]
It looks delicious.

[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:20.960]
Excellent.

[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.460]
Drink it in good health.

[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.660]
Anyway, let me tell you about an auto repair place that really does a great...

[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.940]
That had something to say and it would act relatively normal instead of like...

[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.700]
Like they had St.Vita's dancers something.

[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.340]
But then that would be wrong.

[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.040]
That would be a rip-off.

[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.600]
We'll see how it goes into remote tomorrow.

[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:37.900]
Okay.

[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.760]
Because I don't think we're going to take any calls just like today's show.

[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.960]
This is practice for tomorrow.

[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:43.660]
Okay.

[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.080]
Because we want to get ready for the remote.

[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.600]
We're not going to take any calls tomorrow.

[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.220]
We'll take just a few today.

[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.200]
We'll kind of phase out.

[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.100]
Super Dave, I hope you're putting me on.

[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:54.420]
Okay.

[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.780]
I hope you're putting me on.

[00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:57.620]
All right.

[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.380]
You know, there are some people you cannot insult.

[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.920]
And one thing about doing a talk show in this town.

[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.800]
I've been here 14 years and there are some...

[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.120]
You co-on the ear, you say...

[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.000]
It's like a game.

[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.280]
Like blind Mike.

[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.900]
I didn't hear the call, but he evidently called a certain show on another station this morning.

[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.600]
Because I heard them talking about it.

[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.560]
And it's like the more you talk about how chronic these people are and what a pain in the ass.

[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.800]
And they have nothing to say and how bad callers they are.

[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.080]
The more they'll call just to piss you off.

[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:24.360]

[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.040]
Idiots like children like little infants.

[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:27.560]
Okay.

[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.560]
Let's do the mobile first.

[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:30.800]
What do you think about that?

[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.400]
What I have to think about is the Bennett Show, which is virtually unlisted.

[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.940]
Sir, I don't want to discuss that.

[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:37.180]
Okay.

[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.000]
I'm sick and tired.

[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.580]
Somebody comes to this market and right away all you...

[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.200]
Wouldn't make any difference if we put God on from two to six.

[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.060]
All you people want to do is call and bitch about Alex Bennett, Stan Major.

[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.180]
Anybody that's in there, it's all you want to do.

[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:55.580]
And then if the numbers are mediocre or if they get a lot of flack and they leave, then right away...

[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.420]
Oh gee, we were just getting used to filling a blank.

[00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.140]
Whoever it is.

[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.700]
Okay. You people are so predictable.

[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.180]
You make me want to vomit.

[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.060]
And if you don't want to listen to it, don't listen to it.

[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.840]
But don't call here and tell me about it.

[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.780]
I don't care what you listen to it to a clock.

[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.800]
I'd like you to listen to WIOD 24 hours a day.

[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:12.880]
Seven days a week.

[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.320]
Look, some kind of a lemon.

[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.760]
But I can't force you to do that.

[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.160]
If you don't like it, don't listen to it.

[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.580]
But don't call here and put me in that position constantly.

[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.740]
And then I get all the flack.

[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.180]
Wow, you're ripping, you're doing this.

[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.000]
Listen, I hope the guy gets a 10.

[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:29.100]
All right.

[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.140]
With a decimal point in the right place.

[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.160]
Man, is that piss me off?

[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.100]
I'm so sick of it.

[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.140]
You people are so predictable.

[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.180]
Oh, I don't like this.

[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:41.660]
I don't.

[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.000]
What the hell do you want?

[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:43.320]
Huh?

[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.060]
What the hell do you want?

[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:45.640]
Do you know?

[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.760]
Do you have any idea?

[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.840]
Have you got any concept?

[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.940]
You don't know what you want?

[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.700]
You're like a bunch of little babies with rattles out there.

[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.000]
You're nauseating.

[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.840]
But I'm not going to get upset.

[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.140]
I'm having a little breakfast here, which I didn't even expect.

[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.580]
Thank you, Paul, for bagels and company very much.

[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.180]
For being a wonderful humanitarian.

[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.180]
I'm reaching back in here now for the CDs.

[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.340]
Screw this, okay?

[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.360]
Nobody gets paid enough to put up with this crap.

[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.060]
Right?

[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:14.760]
Screw this.

[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.280]
And as for you.

[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.060]
Neal.

[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.380]
What the hell do you want?

[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.060]
I was in such a good mood this morning in spite of my neighbors.

[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:22.960]
Wait, wait, wait, hold on a minute.

[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.540]
And I'm coming here and all I get is,

[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.180]
wow, wow, that's an expenditure.

[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:26.960]
Listen to me all.

[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.480]
And then I get you on here.

[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.640]
Why don't you give it a rest?

[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.920]
Why don't you find a life and go out and do something?

[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.720]
I heard you call on another certain show.

[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.860]
What are you going to stop?

[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.000]
I call, I call Joey.

[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.040]
What are you going to stop?

[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.020]
He was dying.

[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.680]
Hey, I got news for you.

[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.920]
You were like the nail in the coffin, okay, pal?

[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.000]
Wait, who, who?

[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:43.640]
Your call was pathetic.

[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.540]
My call was pathetic.

[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.320]
No, I'm pathetic.

[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.160]
No wonder they fired your ass at Y-100.

[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.880]
You were a disgrace to the human race.

[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.960]
You're one of these little radio groupies

[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.280]
who has nothing else to do besides listening to jingles

[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.940]
and call up radio stations.

[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.420]
Why don't you do something constructive?

[00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:59.640]
Like go out and sweep garbage.

[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.720]
Wait, hold on a second.

[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.760]
At least on my show, I've never played airsoft.

[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.360]
What show?

[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.420]
What show?

[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.140]
What show?

[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.420]
I'm working in Fort Myers.

[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.780]
What the hell are you calling over here for?

[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.640]
What the hell do you want?

[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.240]
You know, I spare time.

[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:16.700]
What else am I going to do?

[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:17.720]
Hey, I got news for.

[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.520]
I got several suggestions, okay?

[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.400]
But in your case, you don't have the equipment.

[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.280]
Neil, in this town, what do you want?

[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.900]
What do you want from us?

[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.240]
Besides calling you a joke.

[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.400]
Do it for Dave.

[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:28.900]
I'm a creation.

[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.480]
You're like another nightmare that came from that whole chapter of my life

[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.300]
with the Johnny Darks and the Johnny Rabbits

[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.960]
and all these out of work douchebags.

[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.040]
I have enough out of work, friends.

[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.280]
I don't need any new ones.

[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.540]
I'm not out of work.

[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.180]
Well, thank God for that.

[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.720]
Why don't you do some show prep now?

[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.860]
What time's your show on?

[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:47.560]
Uh, tomorrow.

[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.060]
It's good.

[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:48.620]
Well, good.

[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.160]
Get started ahead of time.

[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.140]
Get started now.

[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.020]
It's right out some one-liner, some three by five cards.

[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.800]
Well, you know, I don't have the Olympian in the world.

[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.560]
The Maddie Lips.

[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.360]
And he's the end to play on my show.

[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.020]
It's like you're playing half-time.

[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.320]
Well, here's what you got to play.

[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.980]
This show isn't based on bits.

[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.580]
I can go the whole week without playing any of those cards.

[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.240]
This isn't the bird filling in.

[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:06.560]
Neil.

[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.200]
This is a real radio show.

[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.220]
Al Goldstein, listen to this, sir.

[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.140]
Listen to this.

[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.920]
Al Goldstein says in this letter, and he says it.

[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:13.920]

[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:14.440]
The year-old.

[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.060]
Al Goldstein's a genius.

[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.760]
He says, I know you think I'm sucking up to you,

[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.440]
but I really meant it when I said you the best on air radio personality

[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.520]
in the United States.

[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.280]
Maybe even in the world, and I don't even want to borrow your satellite dish,

[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.480]
or money, or your dog.

[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.280]
I don't even like that.

[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.040]
But Al Goldstein.

[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.020]
From Al Goldstein.

[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.180]
That's why he's putting out a pornography thing.

[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:32.700]
Exactly.

[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.920]
Because he knows what this business is all about.

[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.160]
What do you know about radio?

[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.840]
You worked in Y100 Sweep in the floor for a couple of months.

[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:40.940]
What do you know about radio?

[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.000]
He worked with athletes, put a bunch of losers over there,

[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.500]
a Y100.

[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.200]
What do you know?

[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.880]
I am your expert.

[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.380]
I heard all I crap.

[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.340]
You were auditioned out to Joey on Saturday.

[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.280]
It was embarrassing.

[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.480]
Yeah, but these people don't want to hear about the business

[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.200]
that were in.

[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.960]
They want to hear about topics.

[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:57.860]
Neil, sir.

[00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.460]
You are my ratings for the top.

[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.060]
I don't care about your ratings in Ford Pierce.

[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.480]
Who cares about your ratings?

[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.220]
Who's talking about ratings in Ford Pierce?

[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:05.940]
I'm them.

[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:06.980]
Yeah, you're what?

[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:07.960]
I'm them in the what?

[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:08.480]
I'm the number one.

[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:08.960]
I'm the number one.

[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.540]
It's not like one of Steve's callers now.

[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.080]
Well, you're like a Steve King reject.

[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:13.980]
Neil.

[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:14.580]
What?

[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.280]
Take a valiant break.

[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.640]
Why don't you give it a rest?

[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:17.500]
Neil.

[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.000]
As soon as we say your chronic, you immediately show up on the phone again,

[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.320]
like blind Mike, like Larry Kent.

[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.240]
Like Joy Martell.

[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:25.860]
All right.

[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.460]
Number one, Mark and Brian, a K-L-O-S.

[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.140]
Like Bob Martin.

[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:30.880]
Huh?

[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.400]
because he was desperate for a call.

[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.040]

[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:41.680]
It was just three.

[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.100]
they're probably having like lunch in my house and a little parties in a backyard

[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:24.780]
I wouldn't be surprised is people behind me that complain about the dish

[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.000]
doesn't somebody in a family work I mean this was going on in the middle of the

[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.980]
daytime so you figure you get it installed the daytime nobody's home the neighbors

[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:35.140]
don't see it the umbrella covers it up nobody knows not my luck they're both

[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.200]
home the husband and the wife and their bratty little kid they're all home in

[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.780]
the daytime looking out the window what's that what's that what do you do what are

[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:44.760]
they doing is he ready or is he buying that's another thing boy if you go into a

[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:49.100]
non-rental complex we're almost everybody owns and you're a renter you rent one

[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.560]
of the units from an owner man you were like the scum of the earth down here

[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:57.100]
man you're like you're an outcast you're a slime ball oh he's a renter he's

[00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.980]
one of the any amazing part of it is those of us who read probably take better

[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.920]
care because we got a big security deposit that we'd like to get back at the end

[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.780]
of the lease but hey don't confuse them with the facts see always a

[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:12.880]
renter they got more excuses to hate people down here it's incredible oh look at

[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:17.300]
that Barker man he's got I bet you he's got a llama wig on that's the only thing

[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.320]
I've ever seen that was that same white color just like his puffy it's not

[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.500]
just regular white here it's puffy I think it's llama hair Bob wouldn't that be

[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.540]
something what a scandal that would be if it turned out he had a wig and it was

[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:35.640]
made from some kind of animal product can he have vegetarian by the way no is

[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.820]
anybody know his Bob Barker of vegetarian see I don't I doubt it he probably

[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.960]
isn't it's not in other words okay to eat it just don't wear it that's a

[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.260]

low budget TV show he is a certified idiot this is the defendant he's managed to

[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:28.360]

[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.020]
the crap he was coming out with last night on sports talk

[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:25.200]
man i'm telling i have met some guys who are full of it i think too many

[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.520]
showers with the guys i think it's affected his mind

[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:31.540]
he was ripping the crap out of l way and out of the brachos and how they didn't

[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.280]
even show up and they didn't compete

[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:37.140]
you know i'll tell you that you know something if the dolphins would have

[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:40.820]
played the game and would have been ninety nine to three instead of fifty five

[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:44.500]
to ten he would have said well any other team in the league would have done

[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:48.440]
the same in the a fc because the san francisco just dominates their awesome

[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:52.340]
you know but but because it was denver he ripped them up one side down the

[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.900]
other he ripped l way what the hell does he want

[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:57.740]
i don't know the forty nine years of the class of the league why doesn't he

[01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:58.480]
give him some credit

[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:02.400]
that's exactly true and he was pseudo intellectualizing and all this other crap

[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:06.180]
why don't you just tell like it is in stoppage and why don't you cut the crap

[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:07.860]
yeah he's a good guy that i like manage

[01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:09.600]
anybody who was eighty eight on his back

[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.600]
anybody who went to michigan can't be all good

[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.960]
well that's that's pretty good he went to michigan he's a wool for

[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.700]
reen okay does that tell you why he's going through this midlife crisis now

[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:23.400]
that's not a lot plus working here at w.w.w.a.d. with zagaki man it's had an

[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.720]
effect on him it's just he never be the same again that would do it for me

[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.340]
but insecure but the cubs that's what that's what the exciting thing now you're

[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:35.320]
talking about actually on thirty nine and on how come we don't have any

[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.440]
