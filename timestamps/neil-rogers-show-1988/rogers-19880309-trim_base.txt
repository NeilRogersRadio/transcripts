[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:24.960]
Okay, it's a 25 past seven on WABC. I'm Erbosker Anderson. Hello again. Here's my best to you.

[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.260]
Here's the weather herb. Oh, thank you. I was a traffic on there long,

[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.440]
Island Expressway. Anyway, we know that that's bringing back all those great

[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.520]
memories for both of our New Yorkers not walking the door. See, we have a lot

[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.280]
of New Yorkers here, but they don't get a chance to listen to show because they

[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.160]
spend all morning walking your door trying to find just the right spot. I mean,

[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.160]
we have people down here that used to live on Long Island. Mm-hmm. Yeah, but

[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.800]
they're not from New York. It's only if you're from Fire Island that you're from

[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.080]
New York. Okay, let's go to Fort Lauderdale. Boy, what a what a sad day it is in the

[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.900]
big city over there. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. I do. Pretty good. I see you still got

[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.320]
skinhead for mayor over there. Oh, yeah. That wrong guy got a top off this again. Yeah,

[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.580]
that's what I want. Liberal voters out there and all the old guard, you know, they want to keep the old guy in.

[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.860]
Liberal voters for Bob Cox get serious. They all had they all had arm bands on the ones

[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.620]
that I saw voting for Cox. Yeah. Okay, but I like your show. They were humming

[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.980]
Deutsche Landu Barale is very quietly. You got a great show. I know that. Yeah, but I'm a police

[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.900]
officer down here. Oh, God. Not in Fort Lauderdale. No, in a county. Okay. You mean for the

[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.280]
sheriff for that fascist picnic, Navarro? All right, come on. Don't be talking like that about.

[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.640]
Okay, I won't say the truth. All right. For that great guy, Nick Navarro, right? That great

[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.760]
defender of the Constitution. Yeah, who believes in personal freedoms and liberties and live and let live.

[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.020]
Right. Yeah, you got it. All right. I like your show. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Bye bye. See you later. He's

[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.920]
still a fascist pig. It's a 27 past seven. Oh, yes. Am I going to lie about it? I mean in

[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.360]
Broward County, like I said, they got more brown shirts there than any place else in Nazi Germany.

[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.680]
And any of the kids that are thinking to come in here for a spring break, you better call them

[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.340]
immediately. Get on the phone. If you know anybody who's thinking to come into Lauderdale,

[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.380]
tell them to stay where they are. They're going to get busted. They just come here here. They

[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.640]
breathe. They're going to get busted. But they might be here looking for a job. Yeah, that's

[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.160]
a great job. A big job fair. Yeah. I know that when I was in college, man, all the kids when they

[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.300]
got a spring break day, that's what the main thing that we're concerned about is going to like a

[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.740]
job fair and putting out a three piece suit. Even the girls used to put out three piece suits.

[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.120]
I think that disease is creeping to this part of the building. I think they're filtering

[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.840]
standard major disease through the vents in this building. I'm serial. Oh, don't even

[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.060]
joke about that. It's 727 on Zeta 4 and our next call is a mobile this morning. Hello.

[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.960]
Morning. How are you, sir? I'm okay. Where are you?

[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.300]
To the office actually? Where are you? Be this morning? My brother off the expressway.

[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.240]
117th Avenue in Miami. Oh, God. I'm neutral. Mm-hmm. Good luck to you. Thank you.

[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.340]
Can you give me a few of this and just call a friend of mine a pathetic douchebag.

[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.340]
Okay. Now what's his name? Today is Scott. Oh, Scott is a pathetic douchebag. I know

[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.420]
Scott. Scott is a subhuman douchebag. You guys got great job. Scott is, Scott is moving

[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.480]
mong. Okay. That's what Scott is. Thank you very much. Okay, my friend.

[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.940]
I'm seeing him. Went on the call of duty. Speaking of Scott, whatever happened to Scott from

[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.580]
Brown technical, you know who I'm talking about. Talking in the bell. How come we never heard

[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:54.180]
from him again? I love this show. He's a group, group, groupie. I can't answer your question.

[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.040]
What happened to him? Boy, he'd like disappeared and I never saw him again. I wanted to have him

[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.120]
come in on the show. He wants to be in this business. He is in this business. He's working on some

[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.060]
two-hot station up in La Belle. That's the way you have to start. I lost track of him. He was working

[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.260]
over. He knew law is track of him. That's part of your job is keeping track of our good friends out

[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:21.760]
there. Uh-huh. Well, I failed. Mm-hmm. Good work. Bird strikes again, ladies and gentlemen. Uh-huh.

[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.560]
Okay. Well, I'm moving right along. I just can't believe. It's like Wednesday and it feels like

[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.260]
it's Friday for sure. It feels like we put in a long hard week here. Well, and let me

[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.940]
mention again, if there's anybody listening, uh, who knows anyone in our promotions department,

[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.300]
we certainly need that photographer out here this week, because the Richard Marx concert out at

[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.460]
the Ametro Zoo to benefit MDA is a week from this Sunday. It's the 20th. He's he's ready to come

[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.060]
out here, but he needs a guy. He needs somebody to come. Well, why don't you just tell him? Let's us

[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.100]
set it up and we'll have him come out. If you wait for them when he charges somebody, they're going to

[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.000]
say, why did you have let me tell you something? We forget about it. Don't be a whos. Would you please

[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.300]
just have the guy come out of here? And if they don't want to pay for it, we'll take it out to

[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.100]
Dennis Volder's paycheck. Well, he was supposed to come here tomorrow. You know how that is when they

[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.640]
make deductions from your paycheck, right? Tomorrow. You can relate to that. Can't you Captain Dave?

[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.140]
That's why I'm talking so much to the yeah, exactly. He's getting paid 70 cents a word today. I

[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.480]
spoke to Gary Lawrence about that yesterday. I said, you better take care of Captain Dave.

[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.120]
Oh, thanks. And he said, take care of this. No, seriously, I did. I said,

[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.180]
you better straighten yourself out. Would you please? And he said, I've been trying, but with

[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.200]
not much success. Now, what did you say about tomorrow? He was when we haven't come out here tomorrow.

[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.920]
Have him come out tomorrow. Well, it might be too late now because he has. Yes, other things too.

[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.200]
Well, how about Friday? I'll call him and see you. And he'll bring his stuff out here. Oh,

[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:49.140]
it's tough. Oh, no, no, no, we want pictures taken. Dave's one of those friends of yours with a

[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.060]
suitcase in a satchel. Okay, that's not what we're looking for. All right. Guys, he takes pictures of

[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.760]
a lot of famous people. He's already good. Yeah. For example, divine.

[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.900]
730 on Zeta 4. Now, why was there that pregnant pause like that? Okay. I said, was that

[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.820]
in poor taste? Well, no, but I didn't know how to come back from that. I mean, what can I say

[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.980]
about that? I'm going to miss the joke. Yeah, I'm going to miss divine. I do not want to be buried in

[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:20.300]
a piano case. I'll tell you that. I really don't. Divine's portrayal of Jackie Kennedy was one of the

[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:27.680]
best in the moon. What was it called? Eat your makeup? Yes, it was. This is a matter of fact. A cult

[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.980]
classic. Yeah, probably in a place like the Grove Cinema. Exactly. Right. That's exactly what they show

[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.400]
those cult classics. Exactly. Where it was. It doesn't have to be old to be a classic at the Grove

[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.640]
Cinema Boys and Girls. It does help if it's the gods must be crazy because then it shows for like

[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.420]
two years in a row every day. Did you see the red pony by William Fock? Oh, sure. Yeah. That was

[00:06:50.420 --> 00:07:01.320]
three times. I think that was a cult classic. Yeah. You believe this man? I'm Tonya. It was ever

[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.000]
since we had that one day where he, you know what I was laughing at. Okay, let's go now Cooper City.

[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.840]
Or is this just some guy named Cooper? Hello Cooper. Hello Neil. Yeah, who's this? Oh, how you doing?

[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.020]
Pretty good. Who is this? Let me say it again. Who's this? Oh, it is Michael Laramy. No, I didn't

[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.240]
need your last name Michael Laramy, but that's okay. Is that isn't like Laramy Wyoming?

[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:30.680]
Find the other thing. Yeah, probably. Yeah. So how you doing this morning? Can you imagine if you were

[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.540]
named after Laramy Wyoming, you'd probably be one of the most boring people in a history of mankind,

[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:40.280]
wouldn't you? Why is that a bad town? Oh, why have you ever been in Wyoming? Oh, don't do it. Please,

[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.680]
don't do it. I never even heard of anyone coming from Wyoming. Nobody does. No.

[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.700]
Few people drive through it every now and then when they break down, they kind of like move in

[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:56.340]
there, like into Casper, Wyoming. Oh, the friendly city. Mm-hmm. As in the friendly ghost. Mm-hmm.

[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:02.780]
So what's up this morning? Whatever your name was, Mike? I was just thinking about the

[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:07.400]
poll yesterday. I voted for Decochets because there's no one else to vote for. Yeah, that's exactly why

[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.980]
most people voted for them. Right. I already agree with that. I think they should have a wider

[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.800]
field to some other people running that, you know, at least that are electable. Yeah.

[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:22.880]
Jesse Jackson and Robert. Oh, if you imagine that those kids were elected President and Vice President.

[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:28.400]
Yeah, I don't think that either one of them has a prayer. I like to, you never know. I agree.

[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.380]
But the world with the world coming to, I don't know. I know it's really pathetic, isn't it?

[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.000]
And I'm supposed to get on here and the line of the public and try to get them all whipped up and

[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.320]
excited and you got to get out there and do your civic do it. I mean, it's tragic. I can see why

[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.620]
people get turned off from this. I can imagine I've been really full of running around with grandma boo.

[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.880]
Yeah, I think that the whole world needs a prayer line to be honest with it.

[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:58.240]
If you know what I mean, Mike. Mike, Mike, can I ask you a question? Are we keeping you up

[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:04.560]
this morning? I just woke up actually for them. I'm falling. I'm like, that's hard for me to wake

[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.000]
up in the morning. I don't have to go to work. They'll tend. It's hard for you in the morning, Mike.

[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.560]
Usually, yeah. Oh, God. Why don't we don't want to hear about that? Okay. It's disgusting. Now listen,

[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:19.840]
what do you do? I do construction work. Do you? Yeah. What are you erecting this week? Right now, we're

[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:28.700]
working at what is an office building site in Davy right off 100. Oh, great. Yeah. For my favorite

[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.700]
city's, Davy, I love it. Yeah, it's a tough job. Someone's got to do it, right?

[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:40.620]
Oh, listen, good luck with that new erection, Mike. And have a great day. See you later, Mike.

[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:49.360]
Okay. I think we got him flat footed there. Anyway, nice reaction. Yeah, 734 on Zeta 4, we have

[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.180]
the line. Nobody just hung up his already flashing, man. You think we were doing bio rhythms here,

[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.180]
wouldn't you? Doesn't that attest to the popularity to show it at you can't even get in on his

[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:04.680]
damn show? That's right. Unlike some of those AM shows on those dying stations. So I guess we're

[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.540]
going to take care of the pictures and the hell with it. I guess we ought to start fixing the

[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:14.500]
equipment here too. I guess so. I guess it's a shame. And stuff like this. Someone else, I got to do,

[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:19.060]
oh, like, USA today, I guess I'm going to have to take care of that. Yeah, I think it's kind of like

[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:24.240]
our own show. I think so. I think we're on our own. I'll totally independent contractors.

[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:30.280]
Basically, it's our own station. Well, I like that. Yeah, I like that too. In fact, I'm going to start

[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:36.260]
making some changes on it immediately. For example, God has grilled today with schedule to have

[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.860]
heart, the grateful dead and credence, clear water revival. I think all three of them can go,

[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.920]
you know, together with the tiny bullman. Mm-hmm. So we'll have KC. See a lot of those washed out

[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.580]
hippies from the 60s. You're not supposed to say that about the dead, you know, the dead is

[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.860]
supposed to be where it's at. And that's because most of them can relate to it because their brain dead.

[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.160]
735 on Zeta 4. It's time for another one of our world famous breaks. I thought we just like

[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.400]
took one, didn't we? No. Are you serious? The show is moving that fast. Flying. It's like lightning

[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.520]
and Lucretto, you'll join us right after this on Zeta 4. Okay. I certainly will. It's a 22 before

[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:13.820]
8 on Zeta 4. And let me take a look. Now, is Mayor Galati still on the line?

[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.660]
Captain Dave, is she still on the line? Hang up. She hung up? Mm-hmm. Okay.

[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.540]
See she thinks that that's where it goes, Mayor. Two minutes. Okay, that's where it is, Ms. Mayor.

[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.920]
It's 21 before the hour. We've got two open lines in Broward. People keep flipping off here this

[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:34.700]
morning. Very unusual in Broward, by the way. They usually don't do that to a 777 936 100. I know.

[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:40.340]
They don't have anything else to do. Yeah. Here's a little suggestion for them.

[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:49.200]
From those fascist pigs. Like Nick Novaro.

[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:12.640]
Now we're telling you what's wrong, old Brian. Each night when you turn out the lie.

[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:20.920]
So next time you happen to be sad, make sure you stay on your bed.

[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:33.160]
Turn off. Don't worry watching you. Don't turn off. So we're arresting you. Stop. Just stop making love.

[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:46.700]
Before you break the law. We for it's days to three. You have no privacy. Don't turn over.

[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.100]
Don't turn over.

[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.360]
I look so not want to scare the French Canadians, but we do have several bounty hunters from

[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:01.680]
Homestead and Parade who are on foot, as a matter of fact, and in pickup trucks also, I guess,

[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.380]
underweighted the datebroward line. And we don't want to scare anybody. But if you leave now at

[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:10.900]
about five miles an hour, you're maybe able to head them off at the pace, okay? Hitting do north,

[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:17.180]
okay? Take all your French Canadians, scumbraines with you, all right? 741 on Zeta 4.

[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:23.780]
And our next call is from Fort Lauderdale. Maybe this is Mayor Cox. Hello. Hello, Neil. How you doing?

[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.720]
Hi, this is Scott from MSU.

[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:45.160]
We're gonna blow this game fight, fight, victory for MSU. Well, that was great, wasn't it?

[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.700]
How's that, Neil? I was good. Scott, is that what they taught you up there? Yeah, just a little bit.

[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.820]
Yeah, that's about all you can learn up there in East Lansing, right? I call to give you a hockey report.

[00:13:52.820 --> 00:14:00.680]
Oh, great. Okay, let's turn to the Spartans, boy. This is certainly a big year for all the athletic

[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:06.740]
supporters at MSU, isn't it? Wow. Hey, I was punching the buttons the other day and I was listening to

[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:12.320]
Patty Murray before she exited it to a clock. And what did Patty say? She was talking about her trip

[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:18.300]
down to the keys of past weekend and she slipped and said she started to meet Captain Dave. Then

[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:22.800]
she stopped right in the middle of sentence. They're talking about some other sailor.

[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.240]
That's funny. That must have been a Freudian slip. And the rumor is that Patty, where is a

[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:34.780]
Freudian slip, too? It's Puse. Is there any rumor to it that Captain Dave's been fratting

[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:39.220]
izing with Patty? I don't know, but he mentioned something about her the other day. I know it.

[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:44.020]
I tied the two together. Uh-huh. Well, I think that would be exciting. Really? Yeah.

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.840]
Hey, Neil, have a good morning. I can conjure that up in my mind. I can see them tied like back to

[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:53.340]
the back. Have a good day, Neil. Okay, you too. I think so. Yeah, there he goes.

[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.900]
Okay, 742 on Zeta, before we're going to be talking about Michigan for two hours today.

[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:05.920]
Oh, good. We're going to start at Skipper's Table in, let's see, in LaVonia, Michigan, and head

[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.680]
for a school cracked in the middle belt to Wolverine harness raceway. Oh, maybe Howie can call.

[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:17.820]
Howie? Yeah, I remember Howie. He always calls him a reminiscence of Michigan. Oh, you have

[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.880]
a couple times. I think I'll have. I really. Howie? Howie? He have a problem. Yeah, I noticed.

[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:27.540]
He'd be a illan. By the way, now I got to bring something up far be it for me to dictate other

[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:32.480]
people's tastes. Okay, all the way. I do have exquisite taste in music and in people in

[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.700]
cuisine and in cuisine. But anyway, we were speaking of cuisine. It's funny. You should

[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:40.580]
mention that because we were at the drive-through Wendy's last night and you can't have much

[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:45.780]
better taste. Well, it's, you know, one of those quicky deals. And as we were waiting for the food,

[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:51.560]
now this was on Davey Boulevard. Okay. In beautiful Davey. Now it's not really in David's Fort

[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:57.080]
Lauderdale. And anyway, uh, sitting there and they had the radio blasting, you could just visualize

[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.700]
the big ghetto blast here that was in there. And of course, it was on EDR. And they were playing

[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:08.480]
at scratch stuff. How the hell can anybody listen to this? I mean, it's so loud and just scratchy

[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:15.720]
and puke and noise and mung and God almighty. It's just like any other music. You have to take it

[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.600]
by each individual song. Some of it's terrible. It all sounds the same. Uh, it does.

[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:28.200]
You know, you sounds the same. Yeah. Oh, that's, that's number three. This week with a bullet,

[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.480]
by the way. Oh, that's the one they were playing. Yeah, it's number three with a bullet

[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.600]
and over time. Okay.

[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:45.700]
That's the only game down with a homie show. You want to use his man.

[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.300]
Who that doesn't have that sound, you know, that like opening your zipper

[00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.220]
so you can wrap up your ass. Somebody should don't you think you take it down the line?

[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.280]
They go, you know, take your noodles and your noodles and your other joss and stick them

[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.220]
way down in your furthest sauce. Stick them way down in your furthest sauce.

[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:17.760]
So thank you, Zezet. Thank you, Neil, for the captain and the bird and the horns of the

[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.620]
men. As far as I'm concerned, you can have the rest where I found your rocket. I found the best.

[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.080]
Oh, I found your rocket. I found the best.

[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.360]
Why does your watch keep beeping? Is there a reason for that?

[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.020]
I'm afraid it is. You screwed your watch up.

[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.040]
The one who can fix it for you. He'd be an expert in there.

[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.340]
You know who he is. Uh-huh.

[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:51.000]
That's off the exact time now. 745, exactly on Zeta 4. Give her take a couple of minutes.

[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.680]
We've got this one too. This homemade one.

[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:18.580]
Okay, now speaking of Ellen, if we got a great mole next, I know the bird's going to go nuts

[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.600]
over this call. Hello. Oh, is he gone?

[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.920]
Oh, what a shame that is.

[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:29.060]
But these people this morning are so impatient. It was a mobile caller from Michigan.

[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.820]
Oh, I'm really upset now. It's probably calling from the South Field Expressway.

[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.440]
Yeah, you hopefully to reminisce.

[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:44.080]
Exactly. Stay all those names. Talk about Dick Burton and JPM McCarthy and Bud Gest.

[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.740]
And what is it? The John Lodge Expressway or John Lodge Expressway?

[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.840]
Very good. The Edselford Expressway. I'm learning.

[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.000]
Pick up Dick Burton on the Edselford Expressway.

[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.120]
I'm sure sorry. I missed that one.

[00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:00.260]
In fact, they have I-75 is up there. If you get on I-75 here, if it was completed,

[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.340]
which it's not. But if you got on there right now, you started heading north.

[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.900]
You'd wind up in Detroit eventually sooner or later.

[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.960]
Another exciting starting to keep in mind. If you started right now and followed,

[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:19.580]
if you followed a caravan of French Canadians by July of 2023, you'd show up in Detroit.

[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.700]
Or what used to be left of it.

[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.260]
Anyway, I guess that's disappointing. Miami Lakes. Hello.

[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.320]
Hi. How are you? Great. How are you?

[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.540]
Hi. Good.

[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.940]
I've been listening to you for about too much now.

[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.160]
And my friend Carol turned me out to your show.

[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.000]
Hi, Carol.

[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.880]
We had a caravan number five.

[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.840]
Is it? I thought she was in Carol's city.

[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.240]
Oh, God for that.

[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.420]
That's what we always said.

[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.060]
Great.

[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.460]
And I wanted to tell you we know somebody that you know.

[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.300]
Who is that?

[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.640]
Well, we don't want to say another name for him.

[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.160]
I beg your pardon?

[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.560]
We have another name for him.

[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.420]
Give me a clue.

[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.760]
I'll tell you the name.

[00:19:59.040 --> 00:19:59.380]
Okay.

[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.020]
The name we call this schnutz.

[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:03.280]
Schnutz?

[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.900]
I don't I have no idea who that would be.

[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.180]
Combination between hood and snore.

[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.000]
I know what snore.

[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.160]
Oh, it must be Mr. Ego.

[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:14.620]
A.

[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.640]
Yeah, see I know snore.

[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.740]
That was the clue.

[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.740]
Yeah, that it could have been anybody else.

[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:21.760]
It could have been.

[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:21.760]

[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.280]
Uh-huh.

[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:22.700]
Yeah.

[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:23.440]
How's he?

[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.980]
How's he doing with his problems?

[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:26.940]
He still has his problem.

[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:27.540]
Yeah, I bet.

[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:28.500]
I'm a good vote.

[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.420]
What do you think?

[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.060]
To know him is to love him, isn't it?

[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:33.960]
Well,

[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.080]
I don't know.

[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:36.260]

[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.400]
You're going to do something with him.

[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:37.820]
Exactly.

[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.640]
But I just wanted to call and say hello.

[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.020]
I did tell Carol in February 5th.

[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:43.260]
Hello.

[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:44.240]
Okay.

[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.560]
Well, listen, federal law prohibits us from speaking to

[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.800]
Carol this morning, but I'm sure she got your message.

[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:49.560]
Too late now.

[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.120]
I know.

[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.340]
But you're a sweetie.

[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.280]
Thanks a lot.

[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:52.820]
I love you too.

[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:53.360]
Okay.

[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.120]
Keep it up.

[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:54.680]
Bye, boy.

[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.040]
Bye.

[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:55.680]

[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:56.680]
Wow.

[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.300]
Boy, such enthusiasm.

[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.520]
Such unbridled enthusiasm is going to say at the track.

[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:02.460]
Incredible.

[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.420]
Speaking of the track,

[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.380]
now, when the hell am I going to get out to call her?

[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:05.780]
Yeah.

[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.000]
When the hell are you?

[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:07.680]
This weekend.

[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.560]
Now, you said that last weekend.

[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.820]
Sunday, I'm going to call her.

[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.320]
You said that last week at this time?

[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.480]
Well, I was going to go in and my good friend,

[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.680]
my good racetrack buddy,

[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.880]
crapped out on me.

[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:17.640]
Did he really?

[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.800]
Yeah, the guy they named the track after whose pass I have in my house.

[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.200]
He's been, I don't know what his story is.

[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.460]
He's evasive and unfriendly.

[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.760]
And I don't know what his deal is.

[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.680]
Just because he has been working for six or eight months,

[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.360]
whatever it is.

[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.340]
But isn't he working?

[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.800]
No, in Palm Beach.

[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.140]
No, he was just the alleges that he just filled in

[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.000]
every couple of days.

[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:36.620]
Oh, too bad.

[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.380]
I mean, too bad.

[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.080]
Well, I didn't want to go to work at that station.

[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.240]
I know, but I would like to see him with a job.

[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.380]
That's what I'm saying.

[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.940]
I would like to see him working.

[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:45.340]
Why?

[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.360]
Because he should be.

[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.120]
Why is that?

[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:47.680]
Because he's...

[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.160]
Why do we want to change his life now?

[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:50.520]
Well, that's a good point.

[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.360]
You got me there, Neil.

[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.520]
Vice President George Bush

[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:02.260]
swept all but one of the 17 states that voted on Super Tuesday,

[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.340]
the most spectacular event of the 88 campaign.

[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.660]
And they're commanding lead in the race for the Republican

[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.020]
presidential nomination.

[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:10.620]
Holy.

[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.980]
I'm going to be the next president of the US.

[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.600]
He told supporters of the selection I had for his business.

[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.340]
Don't even joke about that, okay?

[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:22.680]
Well, he had nailed down victories in 16 states by midnight,

[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.820]
including the four biggest Texas, Florida,

[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.500]
North Carolina, and Massachusetts,

[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.900]
and appeared to be raking in a rich hall of more than 600

[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:35.120]
of the 753 national convention delegates that were at state.

[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.840]
Dade voters said guests to education and taxes yesterday

[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.240]
by supporting the largest, most ambitious school bond issue

[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.300]
in Florida history.

[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.920]
Now, this vote will enable the Dade School Board

[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.880]
to float $980 million in bonds over the next five years,

[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.320]
build 49 new schools, renovate 161 schools,

[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.760]
and upgrade more than 250 schools,

[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.780]
and still have enough money left over to pack lunch

[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.000]
for every French Canadian on their way back home.

[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.040]
And good news this morning that Caz is still king,

[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.400]
but one of NBC's new primetime entries may have earned a place

[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.660]
in this royal court.

[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.520]
Day by day found its way into second place

[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.360]
and last week's Nielsen's.

[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.940]
At least one of its three showings,

[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.820]
its most successful night was on Thursday,

[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.980]
when it followed the first place Caz beat show.

[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.580]
And I know you want to know this,

[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.200]
so here it is, the third place show of the week

[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.660]
was NBC's Cheers.

[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.940]
Okay, mostly cloudy today, breezy,

[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.160]
with a slight chance of rain and a high of 82.

[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.060]
Well, tonight will be around 70.

[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.560]
73 this morning at last, at last check,

[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.660]
but we're going to double check it for you folks

[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.860]
in just to be positive.

[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.340]
Just a regular Dave Ryder in his Malif Commission.

[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.600]
It was told exactly.

[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.820]
Say good morning Dave say Dave.

[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.040]
We go with Niel in the morning,

[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.460]
but at night called a Florida party line,

[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.860]
9.7 foot 4400, it's 249.

[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.720]
73, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5.

[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.000]
Like I said, that was good.

[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:05.720]
Still 73.

[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.920]
Notice how he's getting all these free plugs on his channel.

[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.880]
I know that's why he keeps saying that.

[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:10.940]
73.

[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.140]
That's why we keep dialing it up.

[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.420]
And this is obviously Zeta 4.

[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:19.020]
It's coming up on 752 755 on Zeta 4.

[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.400]
You know, the best call of the morning was that guy that we had a bleep.

[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:21.960]
He was good.

[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:22.800]
He was great.

[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.980]
He just came out of nowhere.

[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:24.380]
I know.

[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.820]
I was going along and the singer is so long and doing it.

[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.580]
And all of a sudden,

[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.200]
and just came right out.

[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.080]
See, I like that.

[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.020]
Yeah, he's got that parent syndrome.

[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.940]
Yeah, I relate to it.

[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.120]
Okay, now we have a very exciting call standing by and

[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:36.800]
Broward. Hello.

[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.020]
Oh, Niel.

[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.180]
Hey, you waited this time.

[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:39.480]
Great.

[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.400]
Well, no, I got disconnected last time.

[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:42.660]
Well, that happens all the time.

[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.100]
Yeah, well, I'm sorry about that.

[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:44.960]
I get you are too.

[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.400]
Yes, I'm, I'm Christ.

[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.920]
And the bird was Christ too.

[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.280]
I got back from Michigan.

[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.500]
Yeah, I just got back from Michigan and I heard that

[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.300]
you were talking earlier about Michigan and that you had

[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.420]
a situation where you're looking for Dick Burton to call you.

[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:06.460]
Yeah, we're waiting.

[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.420]
Well, I was in the Fridays on Evergreen.

[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.120]
You know what that is?

[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:10.980]
Yeah, in Southfield.

[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.620]
I was in Fridays.

[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.840]
I met a girl that the sales rep.

[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.320]
I talked to her about getting Dick Burton to call you.

[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:16.680]
Really?

[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.180]
Yeah, so he's going to try to call you this week while you're on the air.

[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.180]
Well, he's on the, that would be incredible.

[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.000]
Well, he's one of my all-time favorites.

[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:24.640]
Hey, super.

[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:25.260]
Yep.

[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.740]
Did you hear about the exit poll?

[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.140]
The Cortana Rice coming out of an exit poll?

[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:29.620]
No.

[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.780]
And they asked who she voted for and she says, well,

[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.580]
my heart told me to vote.

[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.660]
Yeah, I know, I know, but Joe, I wish he was, I know.

[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:37.640]
I'm going to vote for her.

[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.200]
I know.

[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.180]
Yeah, great.

[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.540]
I have to get out of the way into the back.

[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.820]
No, no, wait a minute.

[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:44.980]
Sir, we don't do jokes.

[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.260]
No, you're going to hear this one.

[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.140]
Oh, no, sir, we de-please, don't do this.

[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.780]
I mean, a good Michigan mobile caller

[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.960]
and you're going to do this to yourself.

[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.320]
All right, I won't do any jokes.

[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:52.780]
Don't do it.

[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.340]
Try to restrain yourself, OK?

[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.060]
I know what I'm trying to get the name of the orange

[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.320]
is famous in Michigan for you.

[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.000]
Oh, it's already famous, believe me.

[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:00.320]
Is it?

[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.100]
Were you ever on the radio in Michigan?

[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.540]
In Kalamazoo and in all kinds of other un-mentionable places, yeah.

[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.580]
Oh, I didn't know that.

[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.120]
Oh, sure.

[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:07.780]
Oh, yeah.

[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.840]
Because I lived there for 11 years in Farmington Hills.

[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.360]
Oh, in Farmington Hills, now we're getting started

[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.020]
on some good stuff right out there, not too far from Northfield

[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:16.840]
down, right?

[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:17.960]
That's exactly.

[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.900]
And not too awfully far from LaVonia

[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.360]
and Wolverine Harness Raceway, yeah.

[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.560]
I've been there many a time.

[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:24.560]
Oh, so bad.

[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.380]
Left a good deal of my income there.

[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.420]
No question about that.

[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.780]
Never had a winner there, though.

[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:30.260]
Really?

[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.340]
Hello.

[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:31.880]
Yeah.

[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:33.260]
All right, so we got disconnected.

[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.820]
No, don't panic now.

[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.780]
Just all I said was Wolverine and right away

[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.440]
went into a panic and it would cold sweat.

[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.200]
It's not that bad.

[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.080]
You know, all he has to live in Michigan,

[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.220]
I've never seen a Wolverine.

[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.320]
Have you really?

[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:43.620]
Have you?

[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.620]
No, not that I think of it.

[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:46.860]
It's just a Spartan, right?

[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.200]
I never, in fact, I led kind of a Spartan existence

[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.720]
myself there for a long time.

[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:51.920]
Oh, really?

[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:52.460]
Yeah.

[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.120]
But moving right along.

[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.220]
Moving right along.

[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.640]
We don't mean to bad word this caller.

[00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.040]
Freeway, I've heard that.

[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.040]
But I just got off.

[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.100]
I pulled up to work here.

[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.000]
I just pulled up 95 and I'm going to go to work.

[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:04.820]
And you have a nice day.

[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:05.340]
You too.

[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.280]
All right, talk to you later.

[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:06.820]
Why boy?

[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.240]
He's not leaving, is he?

[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.960]
You know, everybody likes a little.

[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.040]
What?

[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.680]
But nobody likes a smart.

[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.840]
You fill in the word, OK?

[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.720]
Two minutes till 8 o'clock on Zeta 4,

[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.980]
our Michigan Bonanza is starting momentarily.

[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.940]
Why, I'm left down with a banana.

[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.160]
Love, a rotten deal.

[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.020]
Found that y'all devil hiding in her purse.

[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.720]
He's cold and he's hard.

[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:38.220]
But I'm going to have to go.

[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:38.940]
But nobody's got a few.

[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.780]
I hope it never happens to you.

[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:47.500]
Some fruit breaks your marriage into my wife left town

[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.340]
with a banana.

[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.640]
My baby slipped by my way.

[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.640]
I'm a jealous man.

[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.300]
She found us six inch Latin love fur.

[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.540]
Now she does the tango with her right hand.

[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.780]
And right now I could just die.

[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.000]
He's eaten my banana cream pie.

[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:38.200]

[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:38.200]

[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:38.200]

[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.360]
My wife left town with a banana.

[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.620]
My baby slipped.

[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.200]
My baby slipped.

[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.080]
My baby slipped by my way.

[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:48.780]
I need them.

[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.200]
Yes, I hope you beat me in the ring.

[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.060]
You better than I am.

[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.820]
Even the competition agrees, the Neil Rogers show on WZTA Miami

[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:59.340]
Beach forklotted ale in the Palm beaches is the best morning

[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.460]
show in South Florida.

[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.200]
I think I was looking to nice here on an AM station

[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.200]
as a hero in my book.

[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.580]
You're like face-tiles of quieties.

[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.600]
You got no problem with me.

[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.500]
Even the other morning shows listen to the Neil Rogers show on

[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.180]
SATA 4.

[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.380]
I hope you beat me in the ring.

[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.280]
You better than I am.

[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.220]
Eight o'clock on SATA 4 and just a joke about Michigan.

[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.500]
I don't want you to panic when I go through a whole thing

[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.740]
with Michigan callers today.

[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:20.100]
Are we?

[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:20.520]

[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:21.280]
Hello.

[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.020]
Certainly something to think about.

[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.800]
For example, this caller from Pembroke Pines couldn't possibly

[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.460]
be for Michigan.

[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:31.840]
Hello.

[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:32.860]
Hello.

[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:33.540]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.600]
This is Carol City.

[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.900]
Oh, this is Carol City.

[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.020]
Well, that's close to Pembroke Pines.

[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:37.460]
It's right here.

[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:38.280]
Hey, Neil.

[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:38.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.940]
I see your buddy's going to be out with Kane tomorrow.

[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.240]
I see they just can't control Alex Kennedy.

[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:45.300]
Who?

[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.820]
Mr. Tom Chikker.

[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:47.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.240]
Tom is everywhere.

[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.940]
He's like a crawling disease.

[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:51.580]
He's everywhere.

[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.080]
Whether there's too much violence in sports today.

[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.000]
Oh, that's exciting.

[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:55.320]
Yeah.

[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.000]
Isn't that exciting?

[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.980]
Like too much violence at the dog track.

[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:58.780]
That's right.

[00:29:58.980 --> 00:29:59.380]
Yeah.

[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.560]
I just caught part of your show yesterday.

[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.020]
Did you mention Larry Glick?

[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:05.560]

[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.000]
Where is he now?

[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:07.820]
Larry Glick.

[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.580]
I'm not sure if he's back on the area.

[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.180]
He's on WHODH in Boston.

[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:12.080]
Uh-huh.

[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.900]
But did you know that he used to be on INZ down here?

[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:15.400]
Yeah.

[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.320]
Many, many years ago.

[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.240]
He bombed down here.

[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.580]
It was a total disaster here.

[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.600]
I thought he was a J. Michael of his time.

[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.180]
Exactly.

[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.260]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.040]
Look what's happened to him now, though.

[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.640]
So there's hope even for J. I guess.

[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:27.020]
Yeah.

[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.260]
Hey, another thing.

[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.200]
Did you know he's flat?

[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.240]
Off show host on here, Robert Hall.

[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.100]
Oh, yeah.

[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:33.680]
Oh, yeah.

[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.320]
Robert Hall.

[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.160]
I don't know.

[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:35.920]
I think he's in hiding.

[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.460]
I think they spirited him away.

[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.760]
He was always getting death threats.

[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:39.680]
That's right.

[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.640]
He was having all kinds of problems, boy.

[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:41.960]
Yeah.

[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:42.780]
I knew him.

[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:43.600]
I knew him.

[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:43.740]
Larry Glick.

[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.540]
Your buddy over on INZ got a real issue.

[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.420]
Are you in it yesterday?

[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.280]
Did he really?

[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.360]
Oh, my God.

[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.680]
The whole episode.

[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.540]
That's a school bond issue.

[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:54.080]
Wow.

[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.760]
Well, well, that's good.

[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.440]
Because he didn't get any response from people

[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.620]
who wanted to rip New Yorkers.

[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.160]
So he finally got his own show again.

[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:01.540]
That's good.

[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.180]
That's a good sign for Stan.

[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.160]
Oh, he was really hot.

[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.840]
In fact, I would suggest he signed at least a three-month lease

[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:08.980]
at his house where he's going to rent.

[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:13.040]
How many does he listen to tapes of your show before he goes on?

[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:13.660]
Yes, he does.

[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.320]
I got four hours of your show and then four hours of his own.

[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.880]
Yeah, he's got a rich full life, sir.

[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:22.820]
But I think that'll change very soon when this marriage takes place.

[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:23.620]
Uh-huh.

[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.760]
So to speak, man.

[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:26.540]
I thought to speak.

[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:27.840]
Yeah, last thing.

[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.360]
I have the bird.

[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:34.220]
Look at the Fred Pasker item today on our friend Commissioner Phillips.

[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:34.800]
Okay.

[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:35.440]
All right.

[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:35.920]
We'll do.

[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:36.820]
Keep up the good work.

[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:37.320]
See you later.

[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:37.700]
Right.

[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.080]
How do I understand if Beverly gets dumped out, she's going to go to work at Castro convertibles

[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.020]
as one of the sofas.

[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.260]
Where is it?

[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.040]
Fred Pasker?

[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:45.880]
I don't have.

[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.180]
Unfortunately, we don't have it.

[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.580]
We were not allowed to have.

[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.020]
I had to get the herald today in pieces.

[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.440]
So I have to go back and get that later.

[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.380]
But I will do that.

[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.820]
I don't know what it is about this place.

[00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.980]
They only give it to me one section at a time.

[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.040]
It's like a Soviet Union.

[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.280]
You get like rationed out.

[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.820]
Yeah, they only give it to you a little at a time.

[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.760]
I can relate to that.

[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.340]
It's 802 on day to four.

[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.300]
If you go back that way, Captain Dave, could you snack that for me?

[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.080]
And we have a call from Pompano, which is probably really Pembroke Pines.

[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:12.400]
Hello.

[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:13.640]
Pompano?

[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:15.700]
Pembroke Pines.

[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:16.680]
Nobody?

[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:18.360]
There we go.

[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:18.860]
Yeah.

[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:20.520]
Pills, no.

[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:21.620]
It's noodles?

[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:22.740]
Uh, it's good.

[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:23.840]
Come on, get cereal.

[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.480]
Will you please don't put the presses.

[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.140]
I can't handle the agony, okay?

[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.000]
How you doing today, Neil?

[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:29.280]
Great.

[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.260]
I missed the other day.

[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.400]
And there's KC called up.

[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.300]
Yes, he did.

[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:34.780]
But what's he coming in?

[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:35.820]
What's he coming in?

[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.860]
He's busy, man.

[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.200]
He's got all kinds of stuff he's doing.

[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:39.120]
He's making a comeback.

[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:39.740]
That's right.

[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:40.920]
You launched his no career, do you?

[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:41.460]
Yeah.

[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:42.840]
Okay, nice thing.

[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.880]
What happened to Josh Brandt and new Johnny Depp?

[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.340]
And he was going to get him to come in and stuff.

[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.040]
Listen, wait a minute.

[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:49.060]
We got more people who know Johnny Depp.

[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.900]
We had another one just the other day, whose job,

[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.420]
the best friend of Johnny Depp's best friend.

[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.500]
A friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend.

[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.580]
And the very least they can bring his hair in here or something.

[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.780]
If they can't bring his whole body,

[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.440]
at least bring some of the hair in or something.

[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:02.840]

[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.640]
And what about this rumor?

[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:05.860]
I just turned the radio on.

[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.920]
And the rumor kept days in the steam patty my hair.

[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:09.580]
That's the popular rumor.

[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.000]

[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:13.040]
That might be what, why your stomach's going to look like this morning.

[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.500]
That's why his throat's a little scratchy.

[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.000]
Have you ever heard of a voice?

[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:16.380]
Yep.

[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:18.160]
Okay, Neil.

[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.360]
Okay, you hang in there.

[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:19.880]
Okay, I will.

[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:20.440]
Bye-bye.

[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.160]
Okay, he's hanging out.

[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.120]
Put it back in, sir.

[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.500]
It's 804 on Zeta 4.

[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.660]
The weather ought to be extraordinary today.

[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.100]
Shouldn't it?

[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.100]
It's already pretty decent out there.

[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:29.760]
It's going to be all right.

[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.780]
What'd be a great day for the kids from Cooper City High

[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.000]
to combine their bathing suits.

[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.380]
It's going to be a little bit...

[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:34.940]
Just you, Alan.

[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:35.960]
That's all we need.

[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:36.540]
It's going to be a little bit...

[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.440]
Why do you keep acting like I'm interrupting you or something?

[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.460]
Keep like hemming and hawing and stuttering and stuttering and stuttering.

[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.960]
Oh, I thought you asked me to do this.

[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:42.840]
Did you ask me to do this?

[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:43.380]
Did you ask me to do this?

[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.180]
I asked you to do it.

[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:44.380]
Yeah.

[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.400]
But I didn't necessarily mean all at once.

[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.440]
Like, continuously, you could do it like a little...

[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.480]
Little choppy bits and pieces.

[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.960]
Well, I like doing it like that.

[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.360]
You got a weather thing torn.

[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.980]
But I don't know if you can find it.

[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:55.540]
Oh, the weather?

[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.340]
It's mixed in with other stuff.

[00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:58.040]

[00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.580]
Yeah, I don't think it's labeled either.

[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:00.620]
Yeah, shit is.

[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:01.100]
Oh, it does.

[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.620]
Listen, I can handle it.

[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.920]
Okay, I mean, I know that this is the big time radio.

[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:05.440]
I'm a fan.

[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.080]
I'm 77.

[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:10.440]
I'm 77.

[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:10.740]
I'm 77.

[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:11.420]

[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.220]
I'm 77.

[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:12.220]

[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.580]
Mostly cladding and breezy on 77 this morning.

[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.100]
We do have a slight chance of rain.

[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.520]
W-A-B-C-Hide-A will be 82.

[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.200]
I'm 24.

[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.100]
We'll hold it tight about 70.

[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.780]
And it's 73 W-A-B-C degrees.

[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.720]
On WZTA, Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and the Palm Beaches.

[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.520]
And it's 805.

[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.360]
807 on 804.

[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.640]
Make no bones about it.

[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.240]
Bones is the place for barbecue.

[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:38.380]
I'm telling you, you can go to a lot of other places at Claim to have the best ribs in town.

[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.280]
I've all got their cliches and their slogans.

[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.000]
And bones doesn't need that.

[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:46.400]
Because what they've got are those great secret recipes that they've been pumping out for 58 years.

[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.400]
And the end result, mouth watering.

[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.340]
I mean, just delicious.

[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:59.200]
The best barbecue ribs, beans and coleslaw and all those other fixings and home style cornpone down home stuff.

[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.280]
You know what I'm talking about.

[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.100]
And if you're not into that kind of stuff, you're not into barbecue.

[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:03.920]
They've got a great menu.

[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:08.080]
They've got delicious seafood sandwiches, chicken, country dinners, and all the fixings.

[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.140]
There's that word again, right?

[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.140]
I'm here to save room for one of their homemade desserts, too.

[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.620]
And if you're not an archaeologist, you're looking for bones.

[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:21.120]
We'll give you the address, even at some mile and a half north of Glades Road at 3500 North Federal Highway in Boka.

[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.340]
And if you got like an office party or some kind of a special occasion coming up, they do.

[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.120]
I wonder if they bring that whole thing up to your house or to your office like they did here.

[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.900]
Do you remember Captain Dave?

[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:32.020]
Yeah.

[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.480]
I'm serious. I wonder if they bring that whole truck with the big thing with the beans cooking at Loco.

[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:36.820]
Yeah.

[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:38.940]
It does look like a Loco.

[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.920]
Anyway, if you want to find out just exactly what they've gotten, how they do it.

[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.740]
Call them at 368.5911.

[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.640]
368.5911.

[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.760]
And don't forget tonight and every Wednesday, fish fry night at bones.

[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:49.740]
Mm-hmm.

[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:53.160]
And I don't think you'll find many bones, but it's fish fry night.

[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.600]
All white fish fillets or fillets, as Albert Gore would say.

[00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:00.020]
Banner dipped and served with French fries, coleslaw, and homemade tartar sauce.

[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:05.440]
All you can eat fish tonight and every Wednesday, just 695 at Bones in Boka.

[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.180]
What are you doing? You're spilling coffee all over now?

[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.600]
Is that your new contribution to the show?

[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.120]
Very good.

[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.220]
Did a good job, by the way.

[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.260]
Why don't you go in the A-track room and spill some of it in the board there?

[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.200]
I think it's kind of astonishing that we have people who are not strangers,

[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.600]
but people who don't even work here who go in and just manhandle the equipment in there

[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.740]
and kind of turn everything upside down and twist the knobs.

[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:26.160]
You have a problem with that?

[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:30.260]
Because I was doing dubbing all that stuff on Sunday and I looked at the car machine.

[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.060]
I had everything going.

[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.860]
I thought it was right and there was no volume.

[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:33.860]
The needle wasn't moving.

[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:34.200]
Okay?

[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:39.460]
And of course, while I opened it up and somebody had messed with the buttons in here and all of that,

[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.320]
which thank God, at least of technical enough to understand that.

[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:42.880]
Thank God.

[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:43.400]
Yeah.

[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.480]
But it's kind of fun to have kind of non-working people.

[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.140]
Somebody had adjusted the gain control, you mean?

[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.880]
On Monday, Metro Commissioner Beverly Phillips was contrite and angry with herself

[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.880]
over her driving out of the influence charge.

[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.500]
On Tuesday, she hired Richard Essen to defend her.

[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.740]
I wonder how many days before he shows up on a certain show for the 4,000 time

[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:03.980]
this year, right?

[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.680]
I mean, what a great attorney he is, you know, defending the drunk.

[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:12.140]
Isn't that great defending people around there, endangering other people's lives?

[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:17.340]
Essen is the high-profile drunk driving lawyer who informs from 60 minutes to people magazine,

[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.840]
boasts 100 jury wins to every jury loss.

[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.140]
I don't understand.

[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.380]
What is this supposed to prove?

[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.320]
A hundred wins to every loss.

[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:27.020]
Is that so?

[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:27.660]
That's correct.

[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.700]
He was on 60 minutes.

[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:29.900]
Yeah.

[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:34.900]
Oh, yeah, he's the drunk, I mean, not the drunk lawyer, but he's the lawyer that the, the, the, the, the, the, exactly.

[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:35.960]
Do you eyes always?

[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.380]
Yeah, he's the sobriety.

[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.440]
Oh, yeah, I remember him.

[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.100]
The drunk lawyer.

[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.280]
Yeah, the drunk lawyer.

[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:41.540]
Yeah.

[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.100]
I like that, man.

[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:46.440]
You say it a couple of more times and you'll see how fast he'll sue your ass, okay?

[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:51.180]
Boy, you know, Mr. Ronwood lawyers on here, unless of course it's Ellis, then you can have a lot of fun

[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.920]
because he's got a great sense of humor, you know what I mean?

[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.800]
Ten minutes past eight on Zeta.

[00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.180]
And we'd be going to Miami.

[00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.820]
We don't even have to give the numbers out anymore.

[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:00.840]
You know, that is not exciting.

[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.440]
I like that.

[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.920]
That's how much the audience has gotten into this damn show, okay?

[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:04.380]
Right.

[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.100]
They are so deeply into it.

[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.520]
And here are the BGs and how deep is your love on Zeta 4?

[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.520]
Wouldn't that be something if we played that?

[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.260]
That would get Dennis Folger apoplectic.

[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.380]
And you notice he's conspicuous by his absence.

[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.040]
He's been goofing off lately.

[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:18.980]
You know that he has really been goofing off.

[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:19.200]
What?

[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.220]
Seriously, he's supposed to be here 715, 730 coming early and leave late.

[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:24.880]
Yes, he is.

[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.020]
He's supposed to be in early bird.

[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:29.440]
Well, Glenn and I have worked for PDs that didn't show up to like one in the afternoon.

[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.440]
Well, and that probably was a bonus in a lot of cases.

[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.500]
You bet you're...

[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:33.960]
I bet you're...

[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.440]
You're a Cune came in at 4 and left at 5.

[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.760]
How much damage could he do, right?

[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:38.680]
Oh, Miami, hello.

[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.120]
Hello.

[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:39.620]
Yeah.

[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.700]
I got a song for good.

[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:41.600]
You got a song?

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.380]
Yeah.

[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.140]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.600]
Hey, you wanna push it, but you're pushing it through.

[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:52.380]
Grow, let's push you aside and send you what's good to you.

[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:53.640]
Guess they're having it.

[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.360]
It's the other one.

[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.500]
You're having it.

[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.020]
It's the other one.

[00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:58.900]
You're having it.

[00:38:59.220 --> 00:38:59.900]
You're having it.

[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.880]
That was a good one.

[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:07.060]
I think there was one word in there that maybe was a little bit nervous, but that was a...

[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:07.700]
That couldn't tell.

[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.420]
But I understand it.

[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:09.960]
So that's the Brakes Pal.

[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.660]
I know you tried very hard, so to speak, but don't worry about it.

[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.120]
It'll be all right.

[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.440]
Just to take two aspirin and call us tomorrow.

[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.020]
It's 11 past eight, on say to four.

[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:18.340]
Oh.

[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:19.000]
And look at that.

[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.240]
There's kind of a blank look in the controller room right now.

[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:21.660]
Which one?

[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.860]
Number five is a brown shirt story.

[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:27.000]
Oh, a brown shirt story from our fascist county up there.

[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.280]
Hello.

[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.000]
Hello?

[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.420]
Did they take them away?

[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:31.460]
Broward.

[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:32.900]
Speak to us.

[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:34.940]
Oh, boy.

[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:35.880]
I think they took them away.

[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:36.320]
Yeah.

[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.960]
He was calling from A1A.

[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.720]
Yeah, I guess they took them away in the Eric Brandon Mobile.

[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.300]
Can you see him coming up to him?

[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:43.460]

[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.700]
He was on one on each side.

[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:45.820]
He's acting with his hair.

[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:46.440]
Wow.

[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.400]
And it's magic.

[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.300]
What on two points?

[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.180]
Seven with my natural voice.

[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.060]
Anyway, it's 12 past eight on Zeta four.

[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.740]
We had to get Eric Brandon and Paddy Murray together.

[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:56.940]
Would that be a match made in heaven?

[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:57.260]
Ooh.

[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:57.640]
Yeah.

[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.740]
She could scratch his beautiful hair with her voice.

[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:02.080]
Let's see.

[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:02.400]
Now, wait a minute.

[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:03.380]
We have an open line in date.

[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.780]
This could be a critical situation.

[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.660]
620 3600 is that date number.

[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:08.180]
Kindle.

[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.360]
Well, you got kindle up there on the board, Captain Monk.

[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.240]
Hello.

[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.520]
Hey, what's been going on with Amy?

[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:14.960]
Yeah.

[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.240]
Haven't heard you talk for a lately.

[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.120]
Hey, that's to move out of call her in just a second.

[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:18.360]
Yeah.

[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.080]
Good idea.

[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.180]
You're talking about the one on the answering machine.

[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:22.200]
Is there another?

[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.860]
Oh, there are other Amy's around town.

[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.020]
Yeah.

[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.600]
They do amazing things on the phone.

[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:25.920]
Yeah.

[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:27.880]
Psychotic things on the phone.

[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.540]
That's the only Amy I know that rides.

[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:30.880]
What rolls on the hay by herself?

[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:31.440]
Exactly.

[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.920]
Well, listen, if you'd ever seen her, you'd understand why.

[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:35.980]
Well, have a good day.

[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:36.360]
Okay.

[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:37.820]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.240]
For reminding me.

[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:39.780]
Want to call Amy?

[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:40.880]
Yeah, 976.

[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:41.400]
Goi.

[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.140]
And then what it is?

[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.040]
Something like that.

[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:45.960]
Yeah, goi's.

[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:49.340]
13 past eight on Zeta 4 on a wonderful Wednesday.

[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.220]
The sunny shining.

[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.160]
Everybody's happy.

[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.260]
And Amy is.

[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.200]
Hi, you won't believe this guy I went out with.

[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:57.740]
Okay, his name is Robert.

[00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.320]
And he is absolutely gorgeous.

[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.940]
Okay, he's got long blonde hair.

[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.680]
And he's baby blue eyes, which I just could die for.

[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:06.940]
Absolutely rare.

[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:07.760]
This is an old man.

[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.300]
And he's about five foot eight.

[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:10.380]
Well, she went out with him again.

[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.220]
And he could pass as a pop star or something.

[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.100]
That's a cutie right there.

[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:13.640]
Oh, yeah.

[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:15.060]
This is like two weeks ago.

[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:15.760]
Three months to do.

[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:16.700]
Come on.

[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.680]
Come on, Ryder.

[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.360]
What are you doing?

[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:19.540]
You slipping Mickey's by.

[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.420]
We're not paying for this call.

[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.260]
A rerun.

[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.360]
That's a rerun.

[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.040]
And that wasn't a new date with Robert.

[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.620]
That was the same old crappy date.

[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.240]
Now, if you're going to run out of stories and Amy,

[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.240]
we're not going to pay for it.

[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:30.520]
Okay.

[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.460]
I mean, it's one thing to have to pay for it.

[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.680]
It's another thing to get the goods.

[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.120]
Okay.

[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.220]
Shame on you, honey.

[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:38.400]
Do you believe that?

[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.260]
As soon as she said to die for it.

[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:40.700]
Yeah.

[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:41.380]
Oh, yeah.

[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.440]
We heard that crappy old story before.

[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.220]
Okay, Amy.

[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:44.960]
You get serious.

[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:45.780]
Get a life, honey.

[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:48.880]
I want to hear about her date with Dave Ryder.

[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.300]
That's the one that we're paying 250 for that one.

[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:51.620]
Okay.

[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.820]
I heard she makes a lot of money doing that.

[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:54.700]
I bet she does.

[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:55.800]
Mobile, hello.

[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:56.480]
Hello.

[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:56.960]
Good morning.

[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:57.520]
How are you?

[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.360]
We're talking about endangering people's lives on the road.

[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.200]
I'm on the turnpike following some French-Canadian hidden south.

[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:04.160]
Oh, good luck to you.

[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.100]
And I saw a bumper sticker the other day.

[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:06.660]
Wait a minute.

[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.980]
Do you have good aims, sir?

[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.920]
Well, I have a nice car otherwise I try to run them off the road.

[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:12.360]
Okay.

[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.960]
Listen, I saw a bumper sticker the other day.

[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:22.160]
You might be interested in it was said happiness is a French-Canadian heading north with a New Yorker under each arm.

[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:22.740]
Excellent.

[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:23.720]
That's sensation.

[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:24.740]
That's phenomenally.

[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.840]
And you mentioned Dave Ryder.

[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.720]
I won 56 dollars off of him many, many years ago.

[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.320]
Did you really?

[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.980]
And he was on another station with those numbers.

[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:35.340]
QAnne?

[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.360]
On an AM side.

[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.160]
No, yeah.

[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.160]
And on the end of the dial, where it kind of slips off the end of a lot of radios.

[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.180]
That's right.

[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.320]
Oh, anyway.

[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.420]
Did you have a wonderful life?

[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.260]
I'm enjoying your show.

[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:44.940]
Thanks a lot.

[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:45.400]
Take care.

[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.040]
Boy boy, that sounded like a familiar voice.

[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.480]
I don't want to put them on a spot, but that sounded like one of our people from the industry, didn't it?

[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:50.780]
A little.

[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.460]
It sounded like a radio perth in the U.

[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:53.840]
Ha ha ha ha.

[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.760]
Ha ha ha ha.

[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.020]
That's your did the main way.

[00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:58.980]
And you brought back some memories.

[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.320]
You can pull the wool over our ears.

[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.060]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:03.320]
815 on Zeta 4.

[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.180]
I know this is going to come as a shock to you, but I'm going to play the whole record.

[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:06.480]
What?

[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.960]
Yeah, from the motion picture of the same name.

[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.420]
Ha ha ha.

[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.660]
This reminds me of a raw chest.

[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:12.740]
From the movie The Big Kill.

[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:13.060]
Yeah.

[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.200]
I was eating lunch at Don and Bob's one day back up in Rochester.

[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:30.620]
When the night has come and the land is dark and the moon is the only life we'll see.

[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:35.420]
No, I won't be afraid.

[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:43.680]
Oh, I won't be afraid just as long as you stand.

[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.420]
Stand by me.

[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:51.800]
So don't understand by me.

[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:56.040]
Oh, stand by me.

[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:58.080]
Oh, stand.

[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.340]
Stand by me.

[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.520]
Stand by me.

[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:08.380]
It's the sky that we look upon.

[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:14.140]
You're tumbling, Bob, all the mountain.

[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.260]
You're crumble, you're the sea.

[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:24.280]
I won't cry, I won't cry.

[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:32.360]
No, I won't shed a tear just as long as you stand.

[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.420]
Stand by me.

[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:40.640]
And don't understand by me.

[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:44.940]
Oh, stand by me.

[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:47.100]
Oh, stand now.

[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.140]
Stand by me.

[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.280]
Stand by me.

[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:29.540]
No, I won't stand by me.

[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:33.520]
Oh, stand by me.

[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:37.900]
Oh, stand by me.

[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:38.980]
Oh, stand.

[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:39.880]
Stand by me.

[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:45.680]
We never, you're the only one who just stand by me.

[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:50.020]
Oh, okay, all you remember Phoenix Freaks out there just put it back where it was.

[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.900]
It's 18 past eight on Zeta 4.

[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.360]
You know, we should have done before we played that and I was remiss.

[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:56.420]
Zeta 4.

[00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:57.340]
Great.

[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.320]
Okay, now that's 10 years off.

[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.420]
It was 61 on 71, but nobody knows the difference.

[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.480]
It's not important that the year is correct.

[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.980]
It's important that they hear that voice.

[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:09.640]
So did you see that story?

[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:14.300]
Because you were talking about Rochester yesterday and now you're playing that today and there

[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:19.840]
was a story in the herald about that girl from Rochester, New York that was trying to simulate

[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.340]
the scene in front of the train.

[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:22.960]
Really?

[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:23.680]
That movie.

[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:24.340]
Oh, yeah.

[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.920]
And she misjudged and got run over by the train.

[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.880]
And she really, I'll serve her right.

[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.240]
I mean, anybody that's that stupid.

[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.360]
She was trying to simulate the scene in the movie.

[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.520]
So you know how these things kind of fall together.

[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.820]
That was kind of a coincidence.

[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:43.220]
And here's the smoky Robinson in the miracles and the tracks of my tears on Zeta 4.

[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:47.040]
Now was she from Rochester, Capitol?

[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:48.700]
Yeah, she was from Rochester.

[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.200]
Yeah, there's got to be a few dumb people out there.

[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:52.180]
Oh, no, no.

[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:52.800]
No, no, no.

[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:53.800]
You have to be a few dumb people.

[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.520]
But you notice we get rid of them, see?

[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.280]
Oh, absolutely.

[00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:01.040]
That guy and a train man, he sped up to about 195 miles an hour man.

[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:02.360]
He did.

[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.020]
Going like a bad out of hell.

[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.000]
We just don't like dumb people in Rochester, OK?

[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.900]
In other words, most of the people from Florida would never have been permitted to live there.

[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:13.120]
All right.

[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:14.760]
Now, who the hell of these people that are driving in?

[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:15.880]
It's getting to be that time.

[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:16.280]
Yeah.

[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:17.500]
It's 20 past eight.

[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:18.140]
You know what that means?

[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:26.520]
All these pan and he asked bureaucrats and what are bureaucrats and middle level management and lower level management and upper level bureaucrats.
