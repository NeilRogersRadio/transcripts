[00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.400]
You have a chair, it's your sautage dude, isn't it?

[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.180]
That's not it.

[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.900]
Well you know what?

[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.300]
He got me so, you know, it's on here, but he got me so brainwashed to the game of love

[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.120]
by Wayne Fontaine at 10 and the Mindbenders.

[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.960]
You have an interest on so good out of that little bit.

[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.540]
You did.

[00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.400]
You did that again.

[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.100]
We got to go through this whole CD.

[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.240]
Well, that's a good idea.

[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.200]
And then we'll get to number 11 is the Mindbenders.

[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.420]
Right.

[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.580]
You wouldn't have sent anything.

[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.980]
I would have just let it go and not had any idea because, by frankly, it sounded great

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.280]
to me.

[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.120]
It did sound great.

[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.080]
Let's go back to the beginning.

[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.280]
This is our audience hates music anyway, so this is like punishing it.

[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.520]
Well, you can do the talk up on this.

[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.260]
What, Brook Benton and Dina Washington?

[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.520]
I don't think so.

[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.940]
Ooh, that was great.

[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.600]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.800]
You're right.

[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.860]
You don't think so.

[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.340]
You have to go with it.

[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.120]
Very, very question.

[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.920]
Well, it was pretty close.

[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.940]
Yeah, I know, but I think Ricky would give you a no on that one.

[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.360]
You got a sound?

[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.120]
Yes.

[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.040]
Well, there's Dina.

[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.660]
Yeah.

[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.360]
Jimmy Jones.

[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.860]
Great record.

[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.060]
I love this one.

[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.560]
I was a kid.

[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.100]
Did you?

[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.680]
I love this record.

[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.400]
I love the time, the time, the time, it isn't me.

[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.880]
It's true.

[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.580]
It's time to talk to me.

[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.360]
Do you?

[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.000]
Do you?

[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.980]
I believe they didn't grab that stuff.

[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.580]
Look at this.

[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.540]

[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.260]

[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.020]
Perfect, presented.

[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.540]
Johnny A's Dwayne Alman got all the information here.

[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.560]

This next record, yeah, it's been a little overdown, yeah.

[00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.650]
The next record, I can't believe you're never gonna believe this is true story, but it is.

[00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:21.530]
There was a jock in Sarasota one on the ear and thought that this was a Jewish recording artist, Bobby Heeb.

[00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.730]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:24.630]
That's the joke!

[00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:25.370]
No, it's true!

[00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.030]
Yes, it is!

[00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.130]
I'm serious!

[00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.270]
Well, he didn't think it was Jewish, but he thought his name was Bobby Heeb.

[00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.530]
Sunny!

[00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.210]
To like Johnny Talon.

[00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.070]
Yeah, you smiled at me!

[00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.210]
I'm not that you mentioned it, the jock's name was...

[00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.010]
Bobby Heeb.

[00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.010]
Okay, so that's it, but number 11 now, let's get back to the real good stuff here.

[00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.650]
Ha ha ha ha!

[00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.750]
The original video was one of the first 45's I ever bought.

[00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:56.470]
And I feel blue, but I got to do this.

[00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:03.270]
Take the wind out to the land I'm not so blue, when you're close to me.

[00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:10.450]
I can feel your heart beat, I can hear you breathing in my head.

[00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:18.230]
Close to the tree, baby, when we got a groove in our love.

[00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.870]
We got a groove in our love.

[00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:30.510]
Any time you want to, you can turn me on to.

[00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:35.370]
Any time you want to, anytime at all.

[00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.770]
When I taste your lips, oh I start to shoot.

[00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.810]
And control the wind, and bring me the side.

[00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:51.870]
Wouldn't you agree, baby, when we got a groove in kind of love?

[00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.910]
We got a groove in kind of love.

[00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:14.030]
When I'm in your heart, the place is a matter of the future.

[00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.970]
We got a groove in kind of love.

[00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:29.730]
We got a groove in kind of love.

[00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.990]
We got a groove in kind of love.

[00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.030]
What do you mean it's ending?

[00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:39.710]
Oh I'm sorry.

[00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.790]
We got carried away.

[00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:42.930]
I know five minutes and four.

[00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.770]
Thanks to John Ford again for that incredible work of digging that out of our library.

[00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.070]
That's the original which is always better and of course all these stupid remakes today.

[00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.870]
Don't be cruel man, one of the most horrendous abortions in history.

[00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.810]
In fact those right to life people ought to be marching outside the studios where they recorded that.

[00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.790]
That's how big of an abortion it was.

[00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:05.730]
When we come back, thanks to Brian McKenzie, well he's excited to maple leafs are in first place.

[00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:14.070]
And he brought us in this spy magazine July August and it's got this great segment here which probably will take us all the way up till 10 to 10.

[00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:21.010]
People who died it says it's better to burn out than to fade away and I guess we had to play not fade away by Buddy Holly and honor that.

[00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.950]
Oh that's a great song.

[00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:23.310]
It is. We don't have it.

[00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:24.950]
Time to go chew on there.

[00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.130]
55 on his list.

[00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:36.630]
How are we going to do this?

[00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:39.810]
Very careful.

[00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.410]
Yeah do whatever you want to take up the whole rest of the show.

[00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.930]
There's a few and that's it.

[00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.450]
Not good.

[00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:49.730]
Similar, really.

[00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.370]
Okay Johnny A's pledging my love.

[00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:55.890]
1955 died.

[00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.230]
I don't understand.

[00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.050]
He died December 24th 1954 before the record became a hit.

[00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:02.690]
How do you like that?

[00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:08.690]
In Houston, Texas, A's and early R&B star from Memphis shot himself in a mouth with a 22 revolts.

[00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.350]
That's the guys telling you Johnny A.

[00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:15.090]
Apparently while playing Russian roulette backstage at the city auditorium during your Christmas Eve concert.

[00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.850]
He used to play that whole time.

[00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.530]
And one time he lost.

[00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.450]
Dwayne Alman of the Alman Brothers Band, October 29th, 71.

[00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.810]
At the age of 24, died in Macon, Georgia.

[00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.010]
As you lost control of his motorcycle while trying to avoid a collision with a tractor trailer,

[00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.530]
trucky died three hours later on the operating table.

[00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:34.230]
At Middle Georgia Hospital.

[00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.410]
Some of these are incredible.

[00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:44.530]
A Mark Bowler of T. Rex, Bang and Gong, 1971, died September 16th, 1777 in London, England,

[00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:49.650]

John Bonham of Led Zeppelin died September 25th, 1980, the age of 32 in Windsor, England.

[00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:03.550]
