[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.620]
I

[00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:09.980]
You notice I didn't say the this morning captain Dave I didn't say that for the animals you can say talking heads the animals and the journey

[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.280]
It's a minute before nine well, I get all screwed up now Neil TA might be what now Neil told you now

[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.960]
I'm gonna tell you to the plants are waiting for you

[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.800]
This is not a good day. It's not a good day. He's wearing his unbelievable t-shirt

[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.180]
He's not doing anything. He's not bothering anybody. He's just saying they're looking like a freak

[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.040]
Now Neil's told him I told him you want to tell him that's just I mean, you know

[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.840]
He's he's such a good-looking kid, you know, and he comes in here with this

[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.660]
Looking like Frankenstein on a bad day not on a good day, but on a bad day. I mean that is that's disgusting

[00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.440]
It's like how do we describe it like the most of his hair is his normal color, which is brown kind of long down to about

[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.160]
I would say three inches above his ear and then like all the sideburns and up to

[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.320]
Back of his head the temples like temple sign eye or whatever that is temple Beth Sholum

[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.300]
Are like blonde and it's like real short. Yeah, looks like a combination of Rick Springfield and the Beach Boys. Okay or something

[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:13.020]
I don't know just well now. It's like shorn the middle of his head like in shorn Cassidy. Oh

[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.540]
God now you don't want to look like shorn Cassidy all the girls are throwing rotten eggs out

[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.680]
Just getting to work. Okay. There he goes finally Davis. Now. Why are you getting this is your last day before vacation?

[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.400]
Why he's a great cold them? Why can't I tell him but I did it?

[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.760]
I didn't get all be deite and hysterical and

[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:38.360]
Say what's happening? Just do it and get the hell out. Well nothing was happening, and I just hate everybody. Okay, just can't

[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.340]
I guarantee you that if what's your name came in here that from Cooper City. What what was her name?

[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.080]
Denise long gone

[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.920]
Whatever the air is one of Tara one of our former buddies over in Cooper City

[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.540]
You'd have her sitting in a chair. You'd be farmling her and just doing all kinds of disgusting things

[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.420]
Well, am I right? That's true

[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.020]
And you wouldn't be ordering her around and giving her BDI looks okay?

[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.820]
He'd be ordering around but well, yeah, but not to water the plants

[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.240]
It's a minute after nine on Zeta 4 WZTA Miami Beach. I think I already said that in Cooper City

[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.360]
And here's our scoreboard while I held with some of those people in Cooper City, you know what they can just

[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.140]
I don't hear anyways. I don't see what and she isn't gonna be no

[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.280]
She's the last day. They totally shine this you went off to college and I'll stick it where the moon don't shine

[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.020]
They turned out most of those people to be fair weather for not all of them but most of them and a bunch of sissy's and pansies to top it all off in

[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.920]
The Amert bad hearing you thought we called for Johnny dark and not Johnny

[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.980]
These things have yeah, they do happen. So there is some pizza on the way Johnny in case you're starving again this morning

[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.560]
A lot of people out there wondering how John has been able to keep going out of work for so long and he knows where to hang around

[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.200]
He can sniff out a good meal from a hundred miles like any broadcaster, okay?

[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.240]
He can sniff out a good free meal from miles around but what about his little lady?

[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.720]
What does she do when he's like I mean he eats a lot of food here, but she's probably we can't tell you what she eats

[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.680]
three minutes after not on Zeta 4 and

[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.060]
Should we take another caller too because we got a lot of calls on the board there. Oh dear field again. Do we dare?

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.700]
Yeah, dear field maybe you'll make a good promo as in Debbie does dear field

[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.580]
Okay, let's punch it right up there. Hello. I knew yes, sir. How you doing? Okay?

[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.840]
I want to give you a wait a minute. See mean you're actually gonna talk to us

[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.320]
For me? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, there's some people in dear field just want to do things. I don't know

[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.260]
I want to give you the definitive and last and final

[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.840]
Plantation garbage back story. Okay

[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.860]
I'm in the wallpaper business. Mm-hmm. And I was doing that's what Hitler said to sir

[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:56.500]
That's what Hitler said to me. I was in doing a job in Jack Miranda about a year ago and I had to remove some wallpaper and

[00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:04.620]
You know, it's it's a lot of a lot of waste and I asked the woman for a garbage bag and she said

[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:13.500]
I can't give you one because they cost a dollar a piece. Yeah, yeah, you live in a $300,000 house. You can't spare a buck

[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.100]
Yeah, unbelievable

[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.480]
Unbelievable. Well, look, probably I was thinking about that the other day there are probably some people out there who are thinking the same thing about me

[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.580]
You think of what a cheap skater. I am that I don't want to go out and pay 16 bucks a box for plantation bags

[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.880]
It's it's not it's just a principle of it. They really bugs me more than anything else the idea that they're gonna

[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.440]
Tell me what kind of garbage bag I got to use and that they're not gonna pick up my garbage if I don't use them

[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.120]
Well, that's the problem

[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.400]
You can always move from plantation. No, I don't want to do that. I love my house and I love the lake and my pool and

[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.560]
The cockroaches and everything you know one more thing. Yes, sir. Or is pizza places. Yeah

[00:04:52.920 --> 00:05:00.360]
Tomasso is in bokeh. Okay, I'm on plant on the Palmetto Park used to 95. They are excellent great

[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.720]
Really good Tomasso. Tomasso. Okay. All right. Have a good one. You too. Bye-bye. Bye-bye

[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.920]
95

[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.820]
905 and say the Ford Dave is a very feverishly watering these plants. You've got him like terrified now

[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.460]
I said the same thing to him. He's going into the army and you've got him terrified

[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.460]
Well, it's good thing to get used to yeah, and when he finishes basic he's gonna come back and do a number on you

[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.780]
So what you've never seen

[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.960]
Exactly

[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.520]
They're gonna pick you apart like saw seen out of the fly. Do you know fly? Do you know what yes? I think they both the wings off

[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.440]
Do you know where you're gonna take basic

[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.060]
South Carolina oh self-care man now when is that start Dave

[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.400]
August 31st. He's got a whole month to go

[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:53.120]
And he had us conned into believing that he was going off to the army when he left goodbye to exactly said goodbye and good luck

[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.160]
He was in where?

[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.020]
Massachusetts where have we heard that before

[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.280]
He was probably hanging around with the do caucus family. Oh

[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.760]
Now Olympia with the Kennedys

[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.200]
Now just a bunch of douchebags up there. I guess we're in Massachusetts. Um garden. Oh yeah, sure

[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.440]
Why is where where is that near god now

[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.400]
Like in the middle of Massachusetts. Oh in the middle like between pits field and Boston right in the middle

[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.200]
Oh

[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.080]
Nobody lives there. Do they is that near Worcester?

[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.840]
Yeah, right near Worcester as you would say Worcester where they make that sauce. Yeah, they make that great Worcester

[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.160]
Worcestershire sauce. Yeah

[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.600]
Great well, that's a nice place to visit, but don't hang around there too much go now expense

[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.520]
Go down the Foxboro to the track man. You really lose your butt there. I'll tell you

[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.040]
It's dank and it's like

[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.040]
Oh, it's like where was it gray?

[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.320]
Really

[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.360]
Terrible here was raining and nasty and he was up there having a good time

[00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.360]
Now he comes back and our plants by the way, you notice are still alive. Have you noticed that we're giving lots of light

[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.980]
We do do we

[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.460]
They are growing. They're almost up to the ceiling that one. Yeah, they're going crazy

[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:14.260]
And the next time you see this studio, it's gonna be all changed around. We're gonna have some real honest to got equipment in here

[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.960]
Well, just imagine we beat everybody into ratings with this make shift crap

[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.900]
BS system and a stupid little speaker phone imagine what will happen when we get real equipment

[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.020]
Probably be number 10

[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.240]
Yeah, when the callers can start here in captain Dave

[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.000]
Exactly, yeah, that's true when it can actually hear captain Dave it'll be shocking then

[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.800]
Then Ricky Tickey can say it shock radio

[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.060]
It'll be shocking

[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.800]
And what happened?

[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.680]
Yeah, I mean you had a wait. Well listen if you're that stupid. That's what happens to you. What it called?

[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.180]
And ring in the opposite. Yeah, well that was Sunday. We're not here on Sunday day

[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.340]
These guys these two I'm telling you too many days in Miramar that'll do it to everybody okay

[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.740]
So what do they think of that t-shirt by the way? Did they run around saying who the hell is that?

[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:11.640]
That unbelievable t-shirt do we have any more that? I don't think so. What do you mean you don't think so?

[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.360]
Well, I don't know I mean specks is still selling. Oh, yes

[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.340]
I was trying to make is we don't really hear very much about that anymore

[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.240]
We don't want that to be a flash in the pan, but you can still buy in that

[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.760]
Yeah, it's specs and a button from each one goes to the Camilla's house

[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:30.180]
It's a good cause and they're really sharp and they look good and all that stuff right? Mm-hmm close to three thousand or over three thousand

[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.600]
What people are asking if they could get me really well tell them to come down here

[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:41.440]
We like all those people from Massachusetts now are you getting agitated because that was what I don't know

[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.480]
You've got less than an hour than you're going to make a single. Okay. You just had that

[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:52.360]
Sour look on your face. Yeah, like the hardburns sitting here like indigestion the pizza hasn't even gotten

[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.100]
Delay low try that's why Dave's hanging out. He knows the pizza's coming

[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.320]
Yeah, oh really? Did you hear that he's got

[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.840]
Yeah, I haven't seen him smile at broadleast since

[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:12.380]
You guys leave me alone. Phoebe Kates came in just leave me his toe bone. Okay, you guys

[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.220]

[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.120]
Yeah, you guys come in be sure to come in and don't pay any attention to him. Okay, just ignore him

[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.220]
Okay, Dave good to see you get that hair straight now will you please oh he looks a mess doesn't it? Seriously

[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.160]
Mm-hmm see you later

[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.060]
All right, put a bowl over your head Dave come on

[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:44.840]
That'll do you want to do the weather yeah 40% rain chance today with a high of 90 tonight 79

[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:50.080]
It's now 84 and this is eight of four nine. I'm nearly nine after nine

[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:56.140]
For his listing today's not the day. Okay. No track. No and nothing today. It's just one of those things not the day

[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.700]
it's a very um

[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.560]
Traumatic day, isn't it

[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.380]
And of course we've always wondered why this room looks so topsy-turvy many a morning when we come in here

[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.500]
And I think we just discovered the first clue I think uh-uh

[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:14.760]
It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure out what this was used for in here, right in the core we can't describe it

[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.880]
But um now where'd you find that exactly behind the on the floor on the floor behind the board

[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.080]
What can we call that is there a sort of like behind the stadium like a small apartment in

[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.760]
Helendale yeah, yeah, a condominium uh-huh. Yeah, one of those

[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.340]
That's what it is very good

[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.040]
25 past nine on say to four we also found Santa

[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.540]
We found the combination

[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:45.120]
And you found those two there doing their acrobatic routine and the key chain got only knows what kind of a

[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.180]
What a day what a day

[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:53.660]
And Johnny jesus on the way any minute there gonna be a wheeling in here like crazy with pizzas that haven't been invented yet

[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.900]
Something to really look forward to isn't it? So I guess I'll save the record for when the pizza comes

[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.840]
Okay, and in the meantime, we'll talk to Tom from Hollywood. How you doing Tom? All right, how's it going?

[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.440]
I just say I wanted to call him say a couple things um

[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.740]
Number one, I listen to the show every day because I'm on the road. I sell that I sell stuff

[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.780]
What do you sell Tom?

[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.460]
Wow boy you must do big business

[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:28.560]
Right

[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:48.120]
And my dog hopped over to the dog gate and he knocked the phone out of the hand and I lost it first

[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.220]
I mean out of my hand and I lost it for a second. Yeah, and the first thing out of my mouth was

[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.440]
Well, that's important time as long as we can control your life

[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.380]
When you live in this town there are a lot of people who try to control your life, you know

[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.060]
The last thing I want to do is stop oh

[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.800]
Like the Gestapo

[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.520]
For the code enforcement like if you have the wrong type of garbage bag in front of your house

[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.140]
Well, come on up in here. We'll go to plant

[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:26.100]
I want to do a little pop up trailer in the front of your run. Yeah, forget it

[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.520]
You're put on a post and sent out a neighborhood

[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.200]
But um what I wanted to say awesome is

[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.260]
I found this show that Captain Dave was in yeah, and

[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:42.500]
I'm usually not the kind of guy to consider a prank as I get real antsy like I'm really antsy right now

[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.440]
Because I'm a little nervous. I don't know why because I don't see you guys, but I am

[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.200]
But well if you did see us you'd really be nervous

[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.000]
I don't know maybe but um

[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.660]
So the show was excellent. Okay, so this is the first time I did this

[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.980]
I went and saw it the next weekend and I took a friend wow

[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:05.000]
Theater major at fsu. I was just theater major by the way and so I like acting but I just hate watching people act

[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.560]
But

[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.000]
Sure

[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.060]
You say you stay glued to your seat and you laugh

[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.920]
Throughout the whole play. Yeah, I just kind of like him here in the morning you stay is glued to a seat too

[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.200]
Yeah, and last

[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.240]
Yeah, or glued to the floor one

[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.980]
So anyway, those are the things I wanted to say and um

[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.580]
Thanks for the thanks for talking to me and okay. You've been a great caller sir trust me

[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.020]
Okay, hey

[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.540]
Have a great weekend. Okay, I think you want to do something personal there

[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.620]
But 28 minutes after nine on zeta four and just my guess, you know

[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.860]
He's called somebody a douchebag or something. No, I don't mean that kind of thing personal anyway

[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.720]
Jim Skyler is on the 185 probably

[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.460]
I've been trying to ask for an apology and it's long overdue

[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.480]
It's probably the one-year anniversary

[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.100]
Is this it it could be I've been trying to get a hold him all weekend

[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.100]
Okay, now let's see if it's gonna be the first or the second hello the second hello Jim

[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.160]
Yeah, no, they never hear the first one. Hello Jim

[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.800]
I learned yeah every time I said the second one or something about this phone man

[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.820]
It's just a piece of garbage is what it is

[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.240]
A technical difficulty prevent us from continuing with this call

[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.820]
Oh my god, so what's going on Jim?

[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.380]
What's going on Jim?

[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.600]
Neil and

[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:30.340]
Glenn and Dave I just want to be the last to congratulate you on your enormous numbers

[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:35.340]
Yeah, oh listen, we've been flooded with note from stations all over town man. They just been

[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.980]
Climbing all over each other to congratulate us. I had a greeting card for you, but I've neglected to mail it off

[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.360]
I've been I've been remiss in some of my

[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.460]
You've been a miss. I'm probably like in a previous life. Oh could be yeah

[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:52.580]
Is it a little bit plain? I'll probably explain the whole thing better than I was in a little miss mufford right yeah

[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.620]
I see Jim

[00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:00.500]
To make up for that I want to be the first to congratulate you on your 10 month anniversary coming up August 12

[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.540]
Right right that which is a day after I go on vacation which no accident by the way

[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.760]
And three days before that is an even bigger

[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.360]
anniversary

[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:15.600]
August 8th that's probably the one year anniversary of the day that you were treated so rudely

[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.140]
That's it

[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.040]
We knew it

[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.800]
I know it we know it that's been hanging heavily on my mind Jim

[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:30.300]
Watching to know I still feel bad about the disgusting rude and obnoxious manner in which you were treated the indifference

[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:37.740]
And apathy and so what we're going to do that did Jim we're going to go over it again step by step

[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.060]
It's going to take four hours and we're going to go over the whole incident again

[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:45.680]
I hope you still have the longer tape from the other end of the building. Oh no question about it

[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.780]
That's been preserved for the Smithsonian Institute

[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.840]
That'll be super out of looking forward to that so how you guys doing you guys still on the air?

[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.840]
critically yeah

[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.040]
In terms of popular to claim wow

[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.440]
No, but things will be

Things will be looking up real soon

[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.020]
Just remember the wave was voted the best station in South Florida magazine okay

[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:22.360]
And I was voted the best and the worst personality so I can show you what kind of a psychotic

Skitsoid group they interview you don't know whether you're going or coming on that survey do you?

[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.140]

We certainly want to thank you for all your kindness is over these last two year and a half most of which we can't discuss but

[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.440]
A great American and a brilliant genius

[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:54.820]
But he'll show up one of these days very soon trust me you think we should have bumper stickers printed up that say

[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:58.720]
Stand don't call Steve. Yeah, that's a good idea. That's nice

[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:06.460]
Six months ago Glenn said he'd get a unbelievable button in the mail to me that day

[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.600]
By the way Glenn what's the deal you've been showing to me I keep leaving you these messages there

[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.780]

But see I someone calls me I return the call and if there's no answering machine you don't get credit for calling

[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.040]
I don't like that, you know, I call and there's just no answer

[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:46.120]
No, you don't get credit for something you don't get credit for making the call because you don't know I made the call because there's no machine

[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.260]
Okay, well listen this has been very exciting this last part of the call, but we don't want to get into this

So there are two stations that congratulate us

How about the fact that we eat on the air does that still bother him? He didn't say anything about that

[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.140]

Hello hi

[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:15.300]
Great and some trivia while you're eating your tomatoes you all keep talking earlier about the sun ripen sun dry

[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.800]
You want to know what the majority of them are?

[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:26.880]
It's scary what they do is they pick them and then they ship them off to plants where they actually gas some water

[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.780]
Green so they're not they're not sun ripen gas them

[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:39.440]
Tomatoes aren't anyway now. Maybe um. I don't know what he's talking about sun dried. I guess they're just I don't know what he does to those but I'm afraid to ask

[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:45.000]
I'm afraid to know no they're dried out in the sun like on the herald. You know yeah

[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:53.820]
Oh, well go ahead enjoy your tomatoes. Okay. Thanks a lot all right. Okay. I really made our day. Okay. I want to bar fall over the phone now

She was talking about sun ripen

[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.760]
I don't know she was talking about how they take some of them in places and they ship them off to

[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:06.540]
places where they gas them to make the green tomato is red now

[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:12.700]
Not not these looks to me like captain Dave is coming here and got in the second piece. Oh yeah

[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:14.400]
Why would we weren't even paying any attention?

[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:21.020]

[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:22.300]
