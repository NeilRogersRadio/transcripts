[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740]
Number 17 record on your boogie man.

[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.840]
And 1980 to the top record of the whole year.

[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.660]
What we just heard a little bit of was, please don't go by case.

[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.180]
Now this man has made some serious impact right into this business.

[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.040]
That's impressive.

[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.380]
1983, the number two record Africa by Toto, which we're not going to hear little bits and pieces

[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.940]
of again.

[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.720]
That's what the gentleman's all about.

[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.680]
Yeah, when I kill him in general meets the...

[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.700]
Serengeti.

[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.240]
Serengeti at Sarah Havo and Erleens, but it comes flying out of my brush more.

[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.520]
It's a 740 on Zeta 4.

[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.360]
We have a mobile caller in Brown County.

[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.720]
Hello.

[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.980]
That one is just Neil.

[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.800]
Yes, sir.

[00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.260]
Neil, this is the first guy you're doing.

[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.020]
Okay, Kirk.

[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.360]
I can't believe I'm different here.

[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.000]
Voice sounds.

[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.160]
I know it's amazing, isn't it?

[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.180]
On the phone here, it's compared to the radio.

[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.960]
What do you do to it?

[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.860]
What do I do to it?

[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.180]
We put it through a filter like in a lucky strike.

[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.640]
Makes you sound a lot better.

[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.160]
I know.

[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.340]
You do know.

[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.500]
That's why I'm on the radio.

[00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.940]
That's why I don't stand out of three corners with a megaphone.

[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.880]
It wouldn't sound as good.

[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.020]
I got to tell you one thing.

[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.100]
The way you criticize all these other radio stations is really ridiculous.

[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.440]
I know. It's terrible, isn't it?

[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.940]
No, they don't sit around and talk to you.

[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.800]
Your whole show is nothing but sitting around on the phone.

[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.540]
Can I say this to you, Kirk?

[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.560]
If that's the case, how come you're listening, babe?

[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.100]
It was an accident.

[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.060]
It was an accident.

[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.060]
So was that.

[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.780]
I just...

[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.840]
Oh my god.

[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.040]
Did you hear about that?

[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.460]
It was an accident.

[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.440]
These things have.

[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.760]
I know.

[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.540]
Just an accident.

[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.180]
Yeah, maybe you can get back in again, babe.

[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.600]
Unbelievable.

[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.500]
Do you believe that?

[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.800]
Now, of course, the other stations do not talk about us, right?

[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.880]
No, never.

[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.660]
Like the Isle of Dung over there.

[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.320]
They're just apoplectic to try to get us into a shouting match,

[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.300]
which we're not going to do.

[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.280]
Or that zany guy.

[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.160]
And the zany guy who's obsessed with talking about this show.

[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.740]
And Greg and Donald, who used to do neo-rodgers theater before

[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.580]
in 855.

[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.140]
Now, they don't talk about us.

[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.000]
Not at all.

[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.900]
Anyway, moving right along, let's go to a Carol,

[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.180]
another mobile caller.

[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.500]
Hello.

[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.800]
I'm winning, Neil.

[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.440]
How are you, Carol?

[00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.220]
Good. A long time left there.

[00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.080]
First time caller.

[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.640]
I had a call in on a day line.

[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.320]
Great.

[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.160]
Well, you have quite an act to follow, Carol.

[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.100]
I'm fine, too.

[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.500]
Tell me about the melting pot.

[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.940]
Which is the best night to go there?

[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.820]
Which is the best night?

[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.060]
I'll go out of night when it's not crowded.

[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.380]
Like maybe a Monday or Tuesday?

[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.400]
It opens every night.

[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.180]
Every night?

[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.440]
What night are you there?

[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.940]
What night am I there?

[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.740]
Well, I'm not there on any particular night.

[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.880]
I mean, I go every now and then.

[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.000]
But when you least expect it.

[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.300]
That we might bump into you.

[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.320]
You might. It's possible.

[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.500]
I think your wit is wasted on the audience.

[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.260]
In this town, yeah, you're right, Carol.

[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.460]
I should only use about half of it.

[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.380]
And even then, I think it might be wasted.

[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.140]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.300]
But I do my best.

[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.760]
You know, I just kind of fumble along here.

[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.080]
And like the guy said before,

[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.800]
I rip all these other people and it's ridiculous.

[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.380]
We don't have any show and all of that stuff, right?

[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.680]
You've got a great chef.

[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.160]
I know.

[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.000]
Enjoy it.

[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.740]
Listen to it every morning going to work.

[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.520]
Thank you, Carol.

[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.320]
You have great taste.

[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.740]
Have a nice day.

[00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.360]
Carol.

[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.740]
Okay, Carol just kind of like disappeared off into oblivion there.

[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.040]
Didn't she?

[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.500]
These mobile collars, man, they've got a sense of humor

[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.340]
this morning that is unparalleled in the history of broadcasting.

[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.360]
742 on Zeta 4.

[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.340]
I just can't believe that we accidentally, uh,

[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.320]
blow up on it.

[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.020]
What was his name?

[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.400]
These things happen.

[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.600]
Moishi Pupik was at his name that we just just just hit

[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.640]
bump with my arm.

[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.620]
The thing over there.

[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.820]
Well, don't worry about it.

[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.920]
It was amazing because I didn't know my arms were that long to

[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.680]
reach over there.

[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.040]
My elbow.

[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.380]
Okay, let's take a call from Miami next.

[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.180]
This ought to be exciting.

[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.600]
Hello.

[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.560]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.540]
This is exciting.

[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.940]
Morning.

[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.520]
How are you doing?

[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.740]
Listen, and what it is is all the

[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.100]
the normal people are getting strangled out by the

[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.540]
abnormal down here in day county.

[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.200]
So it makes us temporarily insane where we don't

[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.300]
seem as if we are as active.

[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.660]
Now, wait a minute.

[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.560]
Is this Ed?

[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.760]
This sounds like Ed, doesn't it?

[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.500]
Well, it's not.

[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.860]
Okay, you sound just about as monotonous and boring as Ed.

[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.060]
Oh, thank you.

[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.800]
Listen, Neil.

[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.840]
I like that song that they don't go

[00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.940]
whatever by KC.

[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.700]
Please don't go.

[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.380]
Yeah, that's a good tune.

[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.620]
Well, I was wondering now.

[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.820]
Don't do it now.

[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.260]
Wait a minute.

[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.840]
I have not.

[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.580]
You would be so nervous here for just a second.

[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.280]
The airport is going over.

[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.980]
The airport is going over.

[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.440]
Well, going.

[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.960]
On Monday or Tuesday,

[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.200]
I woke up at 2 in the morning.

[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.020]
I heard a

[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.940]
glenn.

[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.500]
What was that?

[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.460]
A nightmare.

[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.340]
What was going on on there?

[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.860]
I don't know.

[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.700]
You're playing KC.

[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.320]
You're playing, yeah.

[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.300]
We're playing up screw cuts at this hour

[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.980]
of the morning for all you people who

[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.280]
get into weird music or something.

[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.320]
I don't know.

[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.640]
I was just waking up in the morning.

[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.480]
You know,

[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.780]
glenn, at 2 when I said, wow, what is this?

[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.140]
You know, no, no, no, it's fixed and he was back on again.

[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.800]
Yeah, did you like it?

[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.180]
Did you like that obscure music?

[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.140]
Yeah, it was pretty good.

[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.580]
Yeah.

[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.540]
It was pretty good, but I don't know.

[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.960]
You got a long time for it, guy.

[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.820]
You need to move it up where everybody's listening.

[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.060]
Oh, no, you guys want to do that?

[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.400]
No, no, we like to hide it.

[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.960]
Yeah, that's on purpose.

[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.860]
Yeah, I've heard the show.

[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.980]
I think it's in the right spot.

[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.560]
Yeah.

[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.980]
Listen, Neal, I was wondering since you were talking about obscure music,

[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.360]
I was wondering about this

[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.820]
by Asia.

[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.100]
Any music by Asia?

[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.740]
You like Asia?

[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.140]
No.

[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.520]
I kind of like Australia myself.

[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.220]
Great.

[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.480]
Okay, well, I guess, uh,

[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.680]
that wasn't a request, now, was it?

[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.560]
Oh, no, I was just wondering.

[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.820]
I feel like, no, I don't, I'm not into that.

[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.400]
Oh, I mean, because you talk about classic hits.

[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.980]
I like Africa by Toto.

[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.520]
Oh, come on.

[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.740]
When Mount Kilimanjaro hits us connected in the eye, I like that.

[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.540]
Yeah, well, I mean, you got turkeys, uh,

[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.800]
lyrics, you know, makes a great song all the time.

[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.100]
Yeah.

[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.860]
It's, uh, Asia did a lot better than

[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.460]
uh, Toto, ever thought of doing.

[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.380]
Well, what was Asia's big hit?

[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.660]
Uh, the, uh, after first album, they got, uh,

[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.080]
11 out of 12 hits.

[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.140]
One of the biggest hits was, uh,

[00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.900]
heated the moment.

[00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.540]
Okay, let me look it up for you.

[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.500]
Now, Asia heated the moment reached number four.

[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.240]
Mm-hmm.

[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.640]
Only time will tell.

[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.240]
Read 17.

[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.860]
Don't cry.

[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.840]
Reach number 10.

[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.640]
And the smile has left your eyes.

[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.560]
Reach number 34.

[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.060]
Those are the only four that they had.

[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.640]
Now, who's the other group you're talking about Toto?

[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.240]
Yeah.

[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.900]
For you who are talking about Toto?

[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.140]
I don't like Toto, by the way.

[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.100]
So don't get the wrong idea.

[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.760]
I think Toto sucks, all right?

[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.340]
All right.

[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.620]
Just mention that in passing.

[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.320]
Well, in, in Toto, um, I think they are Toto-desisted.

[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.900]
Okay, now they had, uh, Africa, which reached number one, by the way.

[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.380]
So I think you're in trouble already.

[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.660]
Okay.

[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.280]
Rosanna, which was number two for five weeks.

[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.260]
And was 18 weeks on a chart.

[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.660]
Hold the line, which reached number five,

[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.180]
14 weeks on a chart.

[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.980]
That was their first hit.

[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.860]
A 99, uh, make believe.

[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.820]
And I won't hold your back, reach number 10.

[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.020]
So I'm afraid I hate to break the bad news to you about, uh, okay.

[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.600]
But don't, don't, don't, hey, listen, don't feel bad about it.

[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.840]
Okay.

[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.400]
Because even Tab Hunter had a big hit.

[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.600]
So, well, the American pubic don't, uh, overestimate their taste.

[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.160]
It happens.

[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.900]
Ain't, uh, just when you're going to have, uh,

[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.360]
both on for interviews.

[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.900]
Yeah.

[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.060]
What are you going to do?

[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.960]
When are we going to have you on for interviews about one to embarrass himself?

[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.640]
People from Cooper City, why can't you have, uh,

[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.560]
both of them?

[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.160]
For what?

[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.080]
You know, so the audience can rag on,

[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.360]
or ask them any questions that they want to ask.

[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.920]
Go on about.

[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.920]
Okay, that's good.

[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.640]
That's a good idea.

[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:20.960]
We'll bring him in here one of these days.

[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.080]
If he's agreeable to it,

[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.380]
mm-hmm.

[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.760]
See, I ordinarily don't like those,

[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.420]
ask the program director things,

[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.680]
because they're corny and they're just the stupid.

[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.220]
Yeah, 100 doesn't.

[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.060]
Well, yeah.

[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:30.980]
He's giving it a try.

[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.660]
Yeah, maybe if we ever get a 10-year-old program director,

[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.920]
like, why 100, he would do it.

[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.120]
I love those commercials.

[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:36.840]
They're just so great.

[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.780]
Hey, we calling, we ask you what you want to do with it.

[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.260]
Well, there are reasons I,

[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.560]
the only reason I like the commercials is there are

[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.500]
a couple of people in the spots who are really interesting,

[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.880]
but you only see them very briefly.

[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.480]
Yeah.

[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.300]
You know what I mean?

[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.100]
We do.

[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.460]
Okay, listen, have a great day.

[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.020]
All right, Neil.

[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:51.980]
It's a great, uh,

[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.060]
great, uh,

[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:53.980]
I'm sure it is.

[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.560]
We're eight minutes.

[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.460]
It's been good for you.

[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.340]
Okay, I'll see you in Asia.

[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.080]
All right, good.

[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:57.780]
Okay.

[00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.200]
We got some Asia here.

[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.160]
Like in Siberia,

[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.840]
we don't play Asia on this station, do we?

[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.120]
We've got three cuts, but we don't play them, do we?

[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:04.980]
I think so.

[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.420]
We do?

[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.520]
Uh, I don't know the past few weeks,

[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.440]
but months ago.

[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:08.900]
Uh-huh.

[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.440]
Are they right next to the, uh,

[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.400]
David Lee Rothkatz?

[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.680]
Which reminds me, by the way,

[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.400]
this Sunday is a very big day in town.

[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.460]
You are aware of that, aren't you?

[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.600]
Well, at the Hollywood snortatorium.

[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.740]
Oh, almost pre-pubescent moron kids are going to be out there

[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.960]
watching this jackass jump around like some kind

[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.600]
like he's got St.

[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.360]
Vitas dance.

[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.160]
Oh,

[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.080]
that's a good description.

[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.060]
Dressed up like he just came from a drag show with the copa.

[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.900]
I mean, he is really.

[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.720]
What, what is with these kids today?

[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.060]
Anywhere.

[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.740]
They really that dumb that they think this guy can sing.

[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.380]
He is.

[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.040]
He's like a walking tragedy.

[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.480]
Even the Bee Gees never saw a tragedy like him.

[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.220]
Speaking of the Bee Gees, by the way,

[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.200]
and I know that gets that gets somebody really upset.

[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.200]
I don't want to mention the best folder's name again,

[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.520]
but can I look up the Bee Gees?

[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.320]
It's so much fun.

[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.120]
Because we know that they're one of those obscure groups

[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.740]
and they certainly are not part of the, uh,

[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.780]
history of the angels of rock and roll.

[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:04.200]
Are they?

[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:04.860]
No.

[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.200]
Now they're more like, uh,

[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.740]
fact, that's probably why we don't play Baby come back by player,

[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.300]
even though it was the number one record of 1978,

[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.620]
because they're more gloves 94,

[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.260]
sure, they do play them on gloves.

[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.560]
I think they really do.

[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.420]
Good for them.

[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.140]
Who am I looking up?

[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.120]
That is probably the reason you're probably right.

[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.060]
Oh, the Bee Gees.

[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:21.580]
Well, let's see.

[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.460]
How can you mend a broken heart with only number one for four weeks?

[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.880]
We can't play that.

[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.900]
I started a joke was number six.

[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.720]
I got to get a message to you was number eight.

[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.460]
Now, why wouldn't we play?

[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.560]
I've got to get a message to you.

[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.420]
That's a A.O.R. type of cut.

[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:35.960]
Kind of.

[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.380]
Yeah.

[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.580]
Massachusetts, which is, oh my god,

[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.380]
look at all of these.

[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.160]
Oh my god.

[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.300]
What is tragedy was number one for two weeks.

[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.640]
Love you inside out was number one.

[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.020]
Too much.

[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:45.840]
Heaven was number one.

[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.600]
Night fever was number one for eight weeks.

[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.940]
Stay in live was number one.

[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.440]
How deep is your love was number one?

[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.120]
You should be dancing was number one.

[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.340]
Jive talking was number one.

[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.220]
They had three six seven eight nine.

[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.180]
Number one hits.

[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.580]
Love so right.

[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.620]
Reach number three.

[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.640]
That was a good song.

[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.420]
He's the liar.

[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.240]
The woman in you.

[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.260]
Run to me.

[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:06.900]
My world.

[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.160]
First of May.

[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.480]
Words.

[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.680]
What about the coal mining.

[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.080]
Oh, here.

[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:11.280]
Yeah.

[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.300]
The lights went out in Massachusetts.

[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.400]
Reach number 11.

[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.440]
Holiday was 16.

[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.840]
Massachusetts is another cut we could be playing.

[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.360]
See, I don't want to say he gets upset when I do this

[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.480]
because it makes it sound like I'm trying to program the station.

[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.200]
But it just seems to me just as an observer

[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.020]
in the passing musical scene with my Lausy taste in music.

[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.700]
That there's a lot of stuff out there

[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.140]
that just doesn't get played.

[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:30.700]
Mm-hmm.

[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.200]
Anyway.

[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.960]
When's the last time you heard anybody play

[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.560]
Massachusetts by the Bee Gees?

[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:34.780]
No.

[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.980]
Or I started a joke.

[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.560]
Should be magic should play those.

[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.000]
I assume they do.

[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.720]
Especially with Decochus in town.

[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.040]
I'm sure he'd appreciate that.

[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.740]
Oh, you're up.

[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.620]
And it's just amazing how this all fits together.

[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.160]
We've got to start by Kitty Decochus.

[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.800]
Well, Sorda, a man who spent nearly four years on the lamb

[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.180]
with two three and a half ton elephants

[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.240]
says he will surrender if he is assured

[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.540]
that the pack of germs aren't returned

[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.080]
to a man he alleges brutalize them.

[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.020]
Arlen Siden, a 58-year-old animal trainer

[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:07.880]
who lives in New Jersey,

[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.560]
hasn't seen his four children

[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.440]
or met his only grandson since he took off

[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.660]
in a tractor trailer with Tory and Duchess

[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.160]
two Indian elephants he raised from impency and then sold.

[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.080]
The elephant's owner, Edward Drake

[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.360]
and his father Richard

[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.600]
and the president of a national animal trainer's group

[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.880]
deny that the animals were abused.

[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.740]
You have a lot of animal stories on my house.

[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.040]
What you'll like this one.

[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.420]
Now, this is a little chart out of today's USA Today.

[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.500]
What are the categories

[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.240]
jeopardy has used most frequently since it's returned to TV

[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.540]
in September 84?

[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.360]
Now, what do you think history?

[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:46.640]
You say history.

[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.740]
That's not right.

[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.400]
You want to guess what category

[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.880]
presidents is also a good guess.

[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.360]
No business and industry.

[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.180]
Oh, yeah, sure.

[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.700]
81% of the time they use business and industry

[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.540]
and sports is number two, by the way, surprisingly.

[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:01.980]
78%.

[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.860]
Well, then you ought to become a contestant, actually.

[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:03.860]

[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.540]
You'd be off in about 30 seconds.

[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:06.680]
Next is science.

[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.800]
68% religion is 65% and animals.

[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.320]
64%.

[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.060]
Eric Burden.

[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.580]
House of the rising sun.

[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.060]
Monterey.

[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.620]
It has to be in the form of a question.

[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:19.400]
That's right.

[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.280]
What is Monterey?

[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.360]
No, it is Monterey.

[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.820]
A city right next to Carmell.

[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.960]
Who is, what's his name?

[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.060]
Already.

[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.620]
No, I just ate the peas that were on top.

[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.680]
You can have the pasta.

[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.740]
But I mean, the pasta is good and all, but I figured I'd save you some.

[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:36.120]
What a guy.

[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:36.720]
Yeah.

[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.360]
What a nice guy, huh?

[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.560]
What a great gesture.

[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:40.780]
What a magnanimous guy.

[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.780]
What a pig.

[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.160]
Anyway, so it's Rick's birthday coming up on Monday, huh?

[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.140]
Rick and Marlene.

[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:49.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.300]
Mm-hmm.

[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:51.980]
No, it's just Rick's birthday.

[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:52.560]
Yeah.

[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:53.660]
Well, let's see.

[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.280]
Big Dave can go with me on, and maybe you can tag along too.

[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:56.980]
You're invited.

[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.080]
Thank you.

[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.120]
On Monday at the Maldipot.

[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:00.660]
Well, see.

[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.360]
Yeah, we'll see.

[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.100]
I always love that.

[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.460]
And let's see.

[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.940]
And you and the big Dave can fight over who's going to have Marlene be their date.

[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.720]
And 29 past nine on Zeta 4.

[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.080]
And they probably won't show up anyway because they're so nervous.

[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.640]
They just, these people get all nervous about this.

[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.300]
They don't understand.

[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.980]
It's just a radio show, okay?

[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.280]
I'm not going to web scone with anybody or drag anybody off kicking and screaming.

[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:23.840]
No?

[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.780]
No, I like them to come with me quietly.

[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.180]
Keep us game.

[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:27.520]
Hello.

[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:28.540]
Deal.

[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.020]
Yeah.

[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.580]
How you doing?

[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:29.980]
Great.

[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.160]
I went to school with that guy with a hat, the guy who works the hat.

[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:34.620]
Mm-hmm.

[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.560]
I went to school with his son up and games though.

[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:36.960]
Oh, yeah.

[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.560]
I went to his house.

[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.080]
Do you know that this guy is married to a former Playboy bunny?

[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:42.820]
Really?

[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:43.260]
Oh, yeah.

[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:43.760]
Absolutely.

[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.420]
He's incredibly hot.

[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:45.900]
It's amazing.

[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.900]
You mean senior is married to a former bunny?

[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:48.580]
Absolutely.

[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:49.620]
A nice lady.

[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.540]
Well, maybe that's why he talks like he has St. Vite's dance all the time.

[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.620]
Maybe that's this.

[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:54.760]
Mm-hmm.

[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.700]
Anyway, the house is amazing, and so is she, but he's pretty nasty.

[00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.400]
Is he really?

[00:13:59.620 --> 00:13:59.800]
Yeah.

[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.420]
Not a real nice guy.

[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.340]
I get a lie.

[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:03.960]
I am not.

[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.200]
I'm not saying I don't say that.

[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:05.620]
Yeah.

[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.360]
But anyway.

[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.520]
Yeah, a lot of people, most of the people who used to work for him or with him

[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.480]
have got very unkind things to say about him.

[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.440]
Yeah, and that's probably very true.

[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.100]
Mm-hmm.

[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.780]
But listen, you're pretty famous.

[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.360]
The world around, I'm sure.

[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.840]
I went to this restaurant out in the town and country mall in Kendall.

[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:25.440]
Yeah.

[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.200]
The food is terrible.

[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.260]
The place was bad.

[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.360]
I mean, it took us an hour and a half to get a table.

[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:30.720]
Hmm.

[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.800]
But everybody they was talking about.

[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.980]
You the waiter was talking about.

[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:34.680]
Are you cereal?

[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:35.320]
What's that?

[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.780]
What were they saying?

[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.580]
Well, they were saying just that.

[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.480]
Well, like for they talked about the Stevie Nicks bit,

[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.320]
which is a riot, by the way.

[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.240]
But I hear this guy with the next table.

[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.540]
I'm making them always just like, uh,

[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.360]
really incredible.

[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:49.940]
The wild.

[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:50.880]
Yeah.

[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.760]
And we were talking about you too, so I don't know.

[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.260]
Maybe it was the fever that was running through the whole place.

[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.680]
Yeah, maybe the Neorodges disease was spreading throughout the town and country.

[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.880]
Yeah, I get something that's got to spread through that place.

[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:01.260]
Yeah.

[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.860]
It was pretty wild.

[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:03.940]
Great.

[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.340]
But anyway, I'll let you get back to your multiple soup and angel here pasta.

[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:08.920]
Okay.

[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:09.440]
Okay.

[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.300]
Just as long as I don't get any angel here in my multiple soup, right?

[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.960]
That would be a bad idea.

[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:14.240]
Okay.

[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:14.740]
See you later.

[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.020]
Okay.

[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:15.520]
Thanks.

[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.140]
931, I'd say to four,

[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.580]
God's River log in 10 past 10 with the 16 in a row at 8 billion hits and all kinds of good stuff.

[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.360]
God's just grilled today, by the way, features, um,

[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.020]
the ELO.

[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.540]
Where are you looking now?

[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.560]
ELO, the kinks and led Zeppelin.

[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.640]
Well, there's nothing wrong with that.

[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:31.140]
Mm-hmm.

[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:31.600]
Hmm.

[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:32.960]
What's going on on that show anyway?

[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:34.780]
Hmm.

[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.300]
Boy, is this good, huh?

[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:36.740]

[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.440]
I'm just trying to sell.

[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.160]
Oh, you're not ready.

[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:38.480]
Sorry.

[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:39.820]
What do you mean I'm not ready?

[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:40.200]
I'm ready.

[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.460]
Whatever you are, okay?

[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.180]
Number six is something about radio.

[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.000]
No, it's not because number six is flashing.

[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:45.640]
Okay.

[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.200]
Well, I guess that's what I'm trying on.

[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:48.940]
Something about radio.

[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.420]
You're right.

[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.700]
Oh, West Kendall.

[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:51.720]
Where's that?

[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.100]
On one.

[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.480]
On one is West Kendall.

[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:53.860]
Hello.

[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.340]
Well, I have a question.

[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.800]
You need somebody to take care of Marlene while you're taking care of her brother?

[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.140]
We have a volunteer, huh?

[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.100]
I think I could handle that.

[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:03.880]
I bet you could.

[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.280]
Monday night at the melting pot.

[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:05.720]
Yes.

[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:06.960]
Seven o'clock.

[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.180]
You're going to come by and say hi?

[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.860]
Yeah, I'm going to come by and say hi, uh,

[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.120]
I'm looking for Marlene.

[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.280]
I bet you will.

[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.960]
Well, we'll probably have her pretty busy.

[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.600]
If the bird and the big Dave come by,

[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.100]
it probably have her very well occupied.

[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.160]
And, um, just for old memories, right?

[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.300]
And, uh, let me just set the, uh,

[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.140]
let me make your phone ring at my own ring at the same time.

[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.320]
I haven't got the flight.

[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.140]
Oh, this is good.

[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:27.740]
Okay.

[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.380]
Is that all we're going to get to here?

[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.680]
You like to hear the whole thing?

[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.020]
Oh, yeah.

[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:33.280]
Come on.

[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:33.680]
Let it go.

[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.460]
Here it is.

[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.740]
We're eating anyway.

[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:37.740]

[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.620]
Yeah, this kills a lot of good time.

[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:41.840]
Greg and Rick.

[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:42.400]
Mm-hmm.

[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:42.980]
Ricky Tickey.

[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.960]
Oh, I like this.

[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.260]
Oh, yeah.

[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.620]
Hey, hey, what happened?

[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.040]
What's up?

[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:54.900]
Rick.

[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:57.820]
Which one?

[00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.520]
Yeah, let's go over there.

[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:00.740]
Hey, I don't know.

[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:01.600]
What the hell happened?

[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.260]
You're following me?

[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:04.860]
I'm following you.

[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.300]
Well, I'm fine.

[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:08.780]
It's you.

[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.000]
Eat it down here.

[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.340]
I have a display in game.

[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:22.600]
How can I make your phone ring at my own ring at the same time?

[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.380]
I'm just going to set the flight at my page.

[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.500]
It's going to be okay, though.

[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:26.280]
Yeah.

[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.460]
Well, I'm supposed to really speed up.

[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.800]
Uh, they've been going just like just a light several times.

[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.260]
Somebody's playing games here.

[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.960]
Your phone ring.

[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.360]
Okay.

[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.260]
Well, third one.

[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.900]
23, general.

[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:49.520]
Okay.

[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:50.560]
All right.

[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.220]
I mean, there's no discussion of

[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.120]
situations, the events of social problems or anything.

[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.020]
It's just shock and radio.

[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.660]
I'm 34 on Zeta 4.

[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.820]
That Rick, he never lets us down, does he?

[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:03.820]
What a sense of humor.

[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.380]
He's always right there when you need him.

[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.380]
Uh, anyway, moving right along.

[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:08.700]
Let's see.

[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.000]
Six is.

[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.240]
I'm trying to just tell me.

[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:13.720]
Okay.

[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.360]
But North Cuba.

[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.080]
They county.

[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:16.400]
Hello.

[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.640]
Let's get to the important stuff.

[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.240]
Why does this?

[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.380]
Tell me a few days ago, you talking about the ratings.

[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.920]
How much did you beat GTR by?

[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.080]
Let's see, we had a four one and they had a three one.

[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.040]
How much age group?

[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.120]
That's 12 plus and in 25 to 54, we had a five, six and I had a four, two.

[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:32.920]
You killed them.

[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.960]
Yeah, we destroyed them.

[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.540]
We wiped them out.

[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.020]
Are they second or was it somebody in between?

[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.040]
Oh, no, no, they weren't seconded.

[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.200]
We weren't even close to being seconded.

[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.540]
We had a bunch of stations in between.

[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.740]
Are you talking, you know, like, 100 or you talking just stations that nobody would listen to, like, what's that?

[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.540]
Do you like you?

[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.620]
No, no, no, I'm talking about stations like Y100 and Waxi and, um, gloves 94.

[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:53.860]
They're way down the line.

[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.960]
Oh, yeah, GTR is in a flat spin, man.

[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.320]
They're dropping like an atomic bomb over Hiroshima.

[00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:58.940]
I'm telling you.

[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.700]
I think the reason is because the other show is really, you know, other than yourself,

[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.920]
there's the only ones that have any, to me, any ability at all.

[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.420]
But they don't do anything.

[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.200]
They're never on.

[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.120]
All they do is, and got a jukebox over there.

[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.140]
I don't think they're funny to begin with, to be honest with you.

[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.040]
Some of the stations were funny.

[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.460]
Well, what's in a great while, but I mean, who wants to listen for four hours and, you know,

[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:18.720]
hoping on a wing in a prayer that today we might hear something entertaining?

[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:19.300]
Yeah.

[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.560]
But they're just not on.

[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.580]
They got a jukebox, you know, and they have that stupid promo that says,

[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.020]
a hermitemic bean and music in the morning.

[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.480]
What a novel concept, which is basically like saying, you know,

[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.200]
they're hanging around here, but we're playing a ton of music.

[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.220]
The reason they're saying that basically because everybody, you know,

[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.540]
this sounds as you've come on and turned to talk basically.

[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:35.820]
Yeah.

[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.540]
Joy Reynolds and...

[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.740]
Well, yeah, see, but Joy, of course, is going to be on of their, uh, soon, unfortunately.

[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.080]
We like him to stay forever, but that just can't go on forever.

[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.820]
And she is playing more music.

[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.240]
They're making Joy play more music.

[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.580]
They got to bring back Jemme and Steve.

[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:47.200]
Who?

[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.000]
That's a guy.

[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:48.800]
He's never there before.

[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:49.140]
They always bring his kids to play.

[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.760]
Jemme and Steve, I mean, get, you have a death wish for them all together, don't you?

[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:54.660]
Those guys are bad.

[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.060]
Yeah.

[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.400]
Oh, how'd you care about the number?

[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.140]
They're not as zany as Joy is.

[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:58.640]
Yeah.

[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.200]
So how far ahead are you, everybody else, where are you?

[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:02.760]
In what?

[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:03.400]
Numbers.

[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.120]
Where's the closest person to you?

[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:05.580]
In what?

[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.520]
In 25 to 54?

[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.660]
Uh, we tied with sunny, he had a 5-6.

[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.120]
We were number two in the market.

[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.040]
CMQ FM, the Spanish language beat us, but in English speaking, we were tied

[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.000]
for first with sunny with a 5-6.

[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.080]
And then there was a lot of people right behind like, I think I don't have it in

[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.620]
front of me, but I think Waxie had about a 5-5.

[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.580]
And gloves had a 4-7 and GTR had a 4-2.

[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.380]
And, uh...

[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:28.560]
Basically...

[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.780]
GTR is beginning to hurt and she is dead in the water and, uh,

[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.020]
we're slowly but surely making some inroads, you know?

[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.140]
I was just curious.

[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:36.920]
Okay.

[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:37.460]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:37.960]
See you later.

[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:38.620]
Bye-bye.

[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.920]
I-37 on Zeta 4.

[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.780]
Monster Ball Soup is great.

[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.480]
The Angel Hare pasta bolognese was phenomenal from Tath Street Road Tisserie.

[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.000]
And the Feta Chini Alfredo is excellent.

[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:50.320]
Mm.

[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.760]
Yeah, I noticed you've cleaned that pretty much.

[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:53.740]
How did you lick the plate?

[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.620]
We were getting close to...

[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.320]
Tam Davis taught me some tricks.

[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:57.720]
Yeah.

[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.640]
See, you can eat it faster and get more nutrition at the same time.

[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:01.960]
Right.

[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:02.880]
More than that was good.

[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:04.520]
Mm.

[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.540]
Now of course comes that moment that you've all been waiting for.

[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:09.920]
Seriously.

[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.020]
As Uncle Neil dips into the Amaretto...

[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:15.520]
Boclava.

[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:16.520]
Boclava.

[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.200]
See, that's where I draw the line.

[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.960]
At Boclava, you're nuts.

[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:23.100]
Mm.

[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.300]
I remember how you didn't know what hamotation was Captain Daniel.

[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.400]
Mm-hmm.

[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.300]
Well, you don't know what Boclava is.

[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.840]
Well, it'll make you feel real Greek.

[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:32.600]
Yeah.

[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.200]
That rock grew from Canada.

[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.820]
Isn't it Boclava turn to robertry?

[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:36.500]
Mm-hmm.

[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:38.060]
Ye mean.

[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.420]
Mm-hmm.

[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:42.800]
Mm.

[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:43.540]
Oh.

[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:45.840]
Or...

[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.600]
This is disgusting.

[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.560]
What do you...

[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.740]
One that I wonder why there's a show going on or something?

[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.060]
It's just...

[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:53.340]
Please.

[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.560]
This look on his face.

[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.120]
No, he's not. He's just into the food.

[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.080]
Don't let him kid you, okay?

[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.280]
What's going on in this room?

[00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:58.940]
He can pack it away.

[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.560]
You are just going to freak out when you taste this.

[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.800]
It is so good.

[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.640]
Amaretto Boclava.

[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:07.680]
Mm-hmm.

[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:08.560]
Mm-hmm.

[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:09.800]
BG's forever.

[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.600]
Mm-hmm.

[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:11.600]

[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:12.860]
Mm.

[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.000]
What is he?

[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.380]
Just going to sit there now while I'm eating.

[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:18.060]
Mm-hmm.

[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.100]
Look at him.

[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.600]
What do you want me to do?

[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.160]
He wants the show to start back up.

[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.660]
So another is basically you have for no act like, right?

[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:26.240]
Great idea.

[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.760]
22 till 10 on Zeta 4.

[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.840]
The food madness continues.

[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:35.960]
I'm gonna look at him in there.

[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.440]
He's like oblivious.

[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:37.900]
Yeah, no.

[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:38.700]
He polished off.

[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:39.280]
What is that now?

[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:39.740]
Feta Chini?

[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.140]
He's eating.

[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.540]
With a spoon too.

[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.580]
He polished it off so fast.

[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.240]
Like most people would either think of yogurt.

[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.940]
He had a pound of Feta Chini Alfredo, okay?

[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.620]
I'm serious.

[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.740]
Yeah, but it's healthy calories.

[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.980]
I bet you eat one of those big stofers lasagna's frozen.

[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.520]
You don't even take the time to cook it, do you?

[00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.080]
Are you kidding?

[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.120]
I don't eat stuff like that.

[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.540]
Oh, sorry.

[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:02.940]
I cook it first.

[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.620]
No, I don't eat frozen food.

[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.080]
Mm-hmm.

[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.320]
Here he goes again when I talk.

[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.040]
At this very minute, my mother is making monocopy for me when I arrive at the hospital.

[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:12.880]
Is she really in Milton?

[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.000]
Oh, in Pensacola?

[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.640]
Well, it's outside Pensacola.

[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:16.060]
Milton.

[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.840]
The best monocopy you've ever tasted in your life.

[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:19.480]
Great.

[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.620]
Now, is that great or what?

[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.040]
Okay, get it to...

[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.660]
I'm going to take it home is what I'm going to do.

[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.040]
Then we have these incredible cookies.

[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.880]
I know the Captain Dei Moe touched this because he doesn't eat sugar.

[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.920]
No, seriously, he doesn't eat sugar.

[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.600]
I'm just going to break off a piece of one.

[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:35.340]
Look at the size of that.

[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.120]
Did you say something about brownies before?

[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.700]
Captain Meng?

[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.320]
He's in a coma.

[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:41.780]
I'm sorry.

[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.500]
Ladies and gentlemen, please send your donations to the

[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.740]
Resurrect Captain Dave Fund.

[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.100]
RDC.

[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.260]
We should have guessed the food content.

[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.140]
And we get all these big ratings.

[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.920]
It's just unbelievable, isn't it?

[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.680]
Really makes you wonder.

[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:06.680]
We do, huh?

[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.620]
It's true.

[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.440]
Yeah, say it again.

[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.300]
We underlined in red.

[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.400]
Well, I can't say absolutely not.

[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:18.380]
Exactly.

[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.400]
20 before 10 on Zeta 4.

[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.280]
And let's take some more calls because the lines

[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.400]
are continuing flashing here.

[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:24.380]
They don't give a damn.

[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.580]
We sound like pigs on the air.

[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.560]
Broward, hello.

[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.160]
Hello.

[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:27.660]
Yeah.

[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.340]
How are you?

[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.420]
How are you?

[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:29.480]
How are you?

[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:29.480]

[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:30.480]
I'm Howard.

[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.500]
I talked to you last week from Michigan.

[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.700]
You have to work at Lou's Delacat.

[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.060]
Oh, yeah.

[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:34.820]
Howard from Michigan.

[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.520]
How are you doing, Howie?

[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:36.160]
Good. How are you?

[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:36.380]
Good.

[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.580]
How can you guys eat all that stuff this early in the morning?

[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.820]
Well, when you get up at 4.30 by 9 o'clock,

[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:41.800]
you're ready for lunch, babe.

[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.460]
This is what I got a good joke for you.

[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:43.900]
Oh.

[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:45.480]
Is it...

[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.320]
We all tell jokes.

[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.480]
But this is a good one.

[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.340]
But is it dirty?

[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:48.980]
No.

[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:49.840]
We sure.

[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:50.880]
Positive.

[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:51.960]
Is it in bad taste?

[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.240]
What were you used all the time, anyways?

[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.140]
Like what?

[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.340]
Well, the fellow wants it for far.

[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.480]
It's a nice guy.

[00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:58.180]
Howie.

[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:58.720]
Yeah.

[00:24:58.940 --> 00:24:59.720]
We don't do jokes.

[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:00.620]
Howie.

[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:00.960]
Joe.

[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.060]
Can I ask your question?

[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.000]
Your whole show's a joke.

[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:03.440]
Howie.

[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:04.060]
What?

[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.100]
He's getting testy now.

[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.000]
How come you won't talk to me, Howie?

[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:08.760]
How do you hear this one?

[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.260]
How come you won't answer anything, I say?

[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.320]
We don't let him tell a joke.

[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.460]
He's not going to like us anymore.

[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.500]
You don't respond to anything.

[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.220]
I'm feeling for Detroit.

[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:15.940]
I've got to like you.

[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.420]
I'm not from Detroit.

[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.900]
I just lived there for two years.

[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.140]
Don't keep saying I'm from Detroit.

[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.580]
I'm from Rochester, okay?

[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.920]
Well, they know that.

[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.860]
That's I guess a few miles out of Detroit.

[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.640]
I'm from a civilized city.

[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.100]
I'm not Rochester, Michigan.

[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.160]
Rochester, New York.

[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:29.540]
All right.

[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.160]
It's in New York, but that's worse, huh?

[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.160]
No, it's not worse.

[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.840]
The great town, if it ever stops

[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.460]
knowing that everybody would want to live there.

[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.320]
I'm just going to joke.

[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:37.060]
Yeah.

[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.780]
We don't do jokes, Howie.

[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.760]
You don't do jokes, and you don't do requests.

[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:41.360]
You just eat.

[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.060]
No, we do a show here.

[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:43.820]
We do the show.

[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.780]
We don't want the audience to enjoy jokes.

[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.740]
But when you hear this, when you might use it.

[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.940]
Oh my god.

[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.420]
What does it take to convince this man from Detroit

[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.940]
that we don't do jokes?

[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:53.940]
That's when that starts to happen.

[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.800]
When I run the city, I turned off the lights.

[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:56.640]
Let me ask you something.

[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.900]
Once the last time you ever heard somebody

[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.000]
call in Dick Purton and do a joke on here.

[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.300]
Well, he's just Dick Purton.

[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.900]
He had somebody, Joe, you don't have to.

[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.300]
Remember, he used to do the coffee and deal from the mayor?

[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:07.900]
Mm-hmm.

[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.440]
Remember Hamtramik Mama?

[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:11.600]
Hamtramik Mama.

[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.900]
Remember him off in Dick Purton.

[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:13.200]
Yeah.

[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.580]
Yeah, he was the funniest.

[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.580]
So howie?

[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.020]
Yes.

[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:17.600]
Howie?

[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.480]
I haven't called that in many years.

[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.980]
Well, it fits, howie.

[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:21.940]
Somehow it fits.

[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.680]
You know, I'm from Lakeland.

[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.300]
You know who to spring trains there.

[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:27.160]
Sure.

[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:27.920]
Yeah.

[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:29.940]
So have you ever been to...

[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:30.880]
The people that met at Worthy train,

[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.860]
and I could have went anyways.

[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.260]
Yeah, have you ever been to Benny's oyster bar up there?

[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:34.980]
No.

[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.480]
How about steak and shake?

[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:37.780]
Bacon shake?

[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:38.880]
Yeah.

[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.460]
I've never heard of this bacon shake.

[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:41.620]
Haven't?

[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.400]
You're trying to get around my joke, aren't you?

[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.520]
Now what gives you that idea?

[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.540]
Well, I don't know.

[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.760]
Now tell us about meeting that guy you met from radio.

[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:50.820]
From whom?

[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.500]
Well, that's right.

[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.300]
Yeah, I have to be at his house.

[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:55.500]
I do pull work.

[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.940]
Oh, you were the pull guy?

[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.100]
Well, not the pull guy.

[00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.620]
We do pull restoration.

[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:00.740]
Mm-hmm.

[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:01.920]
And he...

[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.540]
He told me he just moved down here

[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.440]
and moved into plantation and he knows you.

[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:06.200]
Yeah, sure.

[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:06.800]
We know him.

[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.060]
I don't know if Bacon he's going to be on.

[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:09.440]
Who?

[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.380]
Johnny Dark.

[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:10.940]
Oh, yeah.

[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.980]
Yeah, maybe this one you never know.

[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:14.200]
I doubt that.

[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.440]
Yeah, you never know.

[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.520]
But obviously he's not on the radio yet

[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.100]
because he can't afford to get his pull fixed.

[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:19.920]
That's right.

[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:20.840]
He just moved down.

[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:21.760]
Yeah.

[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:22.880]
But there's girlfriend.

[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:23.720]
Mm-hmm.

[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.760]
I still don't understand.

[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.360]
How does somebody move down

[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.640]
and move in without having a job?

[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:30.620]
I don't know.

[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.500]
That's what I asked him.

[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:32.380]
He'll get a job.

[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:33.460]
You just don't worry about it.

[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.040]
I'll get a job.

[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.560]
I did the same thing.

[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.840]
Hear the silhouette and get a job on Zeta Ford.

[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:38.660]
I did the same thing.

[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.100]
I moved to this town without a job.

[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.300]
Really?

[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.160]
As most people do.

[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.840]
I think it's not that uncommon.

[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.700]
You know, you, I mean, you came to town.

[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.960]
You had, oh, you went to Palm Beach.

[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.980]
So you came to Miami.

[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:50.680]
You had a job.

[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.480]
Pretty on a, you, me.

[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.000]
Yeah.

[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:53.920]
Pretty on the orthodox.

[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.080]
Oh, is it really?

[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.280]
Where the last time he went to Detroit.

[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.100]
In July for one day.

[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.500]
Yeah, did you, did you drive down John Lodge?

[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.560]
Or did you fly over it?

[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.080]
I flew over it's here.

[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.940]
We showed there is so cold there.

[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:08.160]

[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.020]
Wait, what time is going on?

[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.140]
What is that?

[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.120]
What is going on in this place?

[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.160]
So when are you going to tell us that joke, howie?

[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.660]
You sure you're ready now?

[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.240]
No.

[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.100]
No.

[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.000]
Huh?

[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:19.960]
We're not ready.

[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:20.880]
You're not ready?

[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.620]
Well, you know, he's a designer and he has something that's back with Vi

[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.960]
and I'll tell you the joke.

[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:26.960]
Howie.

[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:29.520]
We don't do jokes.

[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.420]
I mean, I have to see if the melting pot,

[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.020]
and I'll tell you if it's the melting pot.

[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:34.460]
Okay.

[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.940]
Or you can write it down and mail it in.

[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:37.200]
Yeah.

[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:37.880]
Oh, my.

[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.840]
And if it's good, we'll take credit.

[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.780]
Yeah, then you'll take credit and use it on the air.

[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:43.600]
If it's good, yeah.

[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.720]
The fact is, really, it's my wife's joke.

[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:46.480]
Oh, boy.

[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.700]
So maybe I should let her tell you.

[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.260]
No.

[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.200]
Now she's afraid to get on the radio.

[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:51.980]
I don't blame her.

[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:54.660]
Well, listen, howie.

[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.700]
You know, good talking to you.

[00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.420]
Yeah, we're 20 minutes to tell you this joke.

[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.100]
Listen, forget about the joke.

[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.980]
You were a great caller without the joke.

[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.020]
Howie, don't you understand?

[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.680]
We had a good time without the joke.

[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.320]
Okay, well, when are you going to get over at the melting pot

[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:08.820]
on the weekend?

[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.440]
Oh, you know, so it's my daughter's birthday, man.

[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:11.980]
She's my grandmother.

[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.680]
Oh, my takeer.

[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.360]
She's not a eight-year-old.

[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:16.740]
I'm going to take her where?

[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.360]
I mean, where's Ashley?

[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.560]
What is he talking about?

[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.400]
Do you have any idea?

[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:19.820]
None.

[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.700]
My daughter's birthday.

[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:21.460]
What about it?

[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.540]
Well, happy birthday, Ashley.

[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:23.520]
Huh?

[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.940]
We've lost control.

[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:26.280]
Yeah.

[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.640]
It's been great, howie, howie.

[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.360]
Oh, I appreciate it.

[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.460]
Howie's freaking out on us.

[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.580]
Happy birthday, Ashley.

[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.680]
Do you like she wanted me to take her to see the chicken,

[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.660]
the chip and dales,

[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.860]
but I just kind of had a pass on that.

[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.400]
The chicken bale.

[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.460]
The chip and dales.

[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.480]
No, eight years old, I think it's a little bit too young for her, huh?

[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.180]
You should take her to chicken bales.

[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.400]
I should take her to the...

[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:51.080]
I take her out for a little birthday treat to chicken pales.

[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.880]
Just a new chicken restaurant in Carroll City up here, right up the street.

[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:56.680]
You know what's up there?

[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.280]
She tried out a burr run on speeder for Annie,

[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:00.560]
but she didn't get the part last.

[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.880]
Great, that's exciting, howie.

[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.580]
You like to dance on your show,

[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.900]
that all your audience see here?

[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:05.880]
Uh-huh.

[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.480]
It's like they have the baby's who contested.

[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.600]
Sounds like your whole family is frustrated performers, huh?

[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:13.660]
Yeah, let's try to do that.

[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.440]
Comedians dancing.

[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.340]
Can you remember you,

[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.220]
do you remember you,

[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.100]
you're only juvenile court that you can be on television and be tried?

[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:20.600]
No.

[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:21.540]
How you don't?

[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:22.800]
I remember Marilyn Turner.

[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.920]
Oh yeah, well Marilyn Turner is very to...

[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:26.700]
John Kelly.

[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.560]
John Kelly, yeah.

[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.460]
Is there still Mary?

[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.460]
How about Bill Bonds?

[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.800]
Is he still on Channel 7?

[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.780]
I don't know, the town's in between him and the scotch and sirloin,

[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:34.700]
but he's still there.

[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.680]
How about Dave Diles?

[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:36.480]
Dave Diles?

[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.620]
Yeah, Dave Diles there, but that lady left.

[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.060]
How about Sunny Elliott?

[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.940]
Wayne Dryers down here, you know.

[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.060]
How about Sunny Elliott?

[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.420]
Oh yeah, Sunny Elliott's still there with the weather.

[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.720]
Do you know who else is down here?

[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.100]
Is the guy Sol and Gray used to be on XYZ?

[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.140]
Sol and Gray.

[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.240]
Yeah, he used to be on Channel 7, he's on Channel 4 now.

[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:55.440]
Uh, you know what left?

[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.400]
Um, what's that girl that left?

[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.060]
I'm sure the audience is just a really sick girl, you know.

[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.320]
They've been on these air-interests with all these millions of people out there listening to us.

[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.700]
Yeah, tell you there's a lot of ex-decoiters out there.

[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.540]
They're probably trying to put two into together.

[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.960]
Yeah, trying, I think, is the...

[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.560]
We understand that the Lou Gordon show is going to make a comeback.

[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.480]
Lou's going to do it from heaven.

[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.160]
He was great.

[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.600]
He was my favorite, you know.

[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.920]
Well, I'll tell you, my favorite is Bill Pick Burton.

[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:20.360]
Yeah.

[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.140]
He's just amazing.

[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.680]
Absolutely amazing.

[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:23.080]
You're right.

[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.380]
He's right at cross-contest.

[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.140]
He went over that one.

[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.660]
Sir, I believe in originality.

[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.960]
Okay, I'm not interested in rip-off.

[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.520]
Oh, rip-off in a bar.

[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:31.940]
I know.

[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.700]
Well, listen, have a great day, Howie.

[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.280]
I'll be seeing you in the only stock until you get to see you later.

[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:36.960]
All righty.

[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:37.420]
Bye-bye.

[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.580]
Speaking of Howie.

[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:39.700]
Voice from support.

[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:39.960]
Yep.

[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.500]
Hello, Mr. East celebrity.

[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.680]
Yes, uh, good morning.

[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:45.900]
Good morning.

[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.640]
It is Mr. Stern.

[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:48.600]
Yes, it is.

[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.020]
You want to voice your support for us?

[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.440]
I guess I do, I do.

[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.280]
I got my serious, serious voice now.

[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.480]
Oh, it's now, Lewis.

[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:56.820]
Grandpa from the Munsters.

[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.940]
You know, once Grandpa from the Munsters gets angry at the FCC,

[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.440]
I bet you're going to create a potion.

[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.260]
You're going to make him disappear.

[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.620]
Can I tell you something?

[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.480]
Go ahead.

[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:10.500]
Even I can't create a potion for those in the end of the pool.

[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:11.220]
Come to the heck.

[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.920]
They're beyond the grade of those people.

[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:14.620]
But no, really.

[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.600]
I want to tell you, Howie, I mean nobody.

[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:19.540]
No offense, Grandpa.

[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:20.440]
I don't know you that well for you.

[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.220]
Still call me Howie.

[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:22.660]
Howie.

[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.440]
Working that way, West TV.

[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:24.960]
West TV.

[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.440]
Howie.

[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.900]
Tell us about that.

[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:28.900]
Oh, Grandpa.

[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.800]
I mean, howie, howie, why?

[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.700]
May it be like the Echee.

[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.060]
Okay, it's 12 minutes before 10.

[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.540]
I thought that would fit in, wouldn't you?

[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.540]
Well, so in other words, if anyone wants to call in reminisce about Michigan,

[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:41.740]
this is the show to call.

[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.480]
This is the, uh, Michigan or show, right?

[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:43.780]
Yeah.

[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:44.280]
Great.

[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.660]
I must say that I like the Detroit collars,

[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.560]
but that one, I got a little lost.

[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.100]
Howie?

[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.120]
Confused, yeah.

[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:51.280]
That one.

[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.820]
Frustrated performer don't understand it runs in the family.

[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:54.420]
Mm-hmm.

[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:58.740]
Okay, let's get another call out from plantation before we have to do our thing here.

[00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.000]
Hello.

[00:32:59.280 --> 00:32:59.940]
Hi, Neil.

[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:00.320]
Hi.

[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:03.220]
I just wanted to make this real short and sweet.

[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:03.720]
Okay.

[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.520]
Read about you.

[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:08.180]
I don't know what I do if I didn't have your show to listen to in the morning.

[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:08.560]
Yeah.

[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.600]
Take it easy on those heavy foods, okay?

[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.060]
I know.

[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.160]
They're just, they're just, uh,

[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.600]
killing me with kindness here,

[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.440]
and it's just pouring the food down my throat.

[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.080]
Uh, you can keep the mouth closed for the food,

[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.800]
so you can get the funny stuff coming out.

[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.000]
Okay, I gotta go check out my thumbnail,

[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.320]
but thanks for answering my call.

[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.320]
Okay, bye-bye.

[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:24.700]
Wow.

[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.300]
As a matter of fact, since I have been eating all of this food,

[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.900]
I have had some funny stuff coming out.

[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.320]
Oh, you're welcome.

[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.800]
But we certainly don't want to discuss that.

[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.600]
The big question among reporters at the Grammys last night was,

[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:41.660]
would Michael Jackson join the winners in speaking with reporters backstage?

[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:46.500]
Well, the question became moot when he lost all four awards he was up for.

[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.120]
But the night wasn't a total loss for Mickey.

[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.060]
He got a standing ovation after performed his latest single,

[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.660]
man in the mirror.

[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.120]
Oh.

[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.920]
First lady Nancy Reagan says doctors should watch what they say when commenting in public

[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.900]
on the health of presidents and their families.

[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:05.920]
In an ABC interview to be broadcast tomorrow night, Mrs. Reagan said she recalls watching TV

[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.880]
with her husband while he was in the hospital.

[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:13.600]
When the doctor came on the set and said he'd give the president four or five months to live.

[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:14.140]
Yeah.

[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.580]
You know that Nancy said that her husband was the most important president in the

[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:20.240]
American history.

[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.760]
Oh my god.

[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.880]
Anybody should know.

[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.000]
Yeah, well, we want to wish happy birthday today to James Dewan.

[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.220]
He is Scotty on Star Trek.

[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:34.400]
He's 68 today.

[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.520]
Also Ed Maranero who was on Hill Street Blues.

[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:39.860]
It's his birthday today.

[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:40.360]
That's correct.

[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.800]
He played for Cornell by them.

[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.180]
That's a lot of trivia there.

[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:43.980]
Did he play for Cornell?

[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:48.300]
Now, it was on this state and history 10 years ago today

[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:54.060]
that the remains of comedian Charlie Chaplin were stolen by extortionists from his grave in Switzerland.

[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.060]
Now it was Michael Jackson.

[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.000]
Oh yeah, that's right.

[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.260]
And five years ago today in LA,

[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.360]
President Reagan challenged the TV networks

[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.680]
the dwell on good news for National Volunteer Week.

[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.460]
And by the way, the networks declined.

[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.980]
You don't realize it, but Ricky Schroeder has President Kennedy's brain.

[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:10.560]
Did you know that?

[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.000]
It's true stirring.

[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.500]
Okay, anything else going on today?

[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:17.340]
I think that's it.

[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.680]
I think we got it all partly cloudy.

[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.820]
It'll be about 80 today and 68 tonight.

[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.860]
And it's 72 now on Jada 4 at 951.

[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.020]
954 on Jada 4.

[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.700]
Now let's put our Jada 4 microphone in the control room for just a moment or two

[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:34.460]
and see how Captain Dave is coping with two days in a row of this gluttony.

[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.480]
Okay, I'm gonna write a law.

[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.040]
Moving right along.

[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.060]
Oh god, I just, I don't know how he's keeping it up, man.

[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:51.060]
It just never stops.

[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.260]
It never stops.

[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.700]
It goes on and on and on.

[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:55.720]
What is this?

[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.160]
CBS.

[00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.220]
It's stuff explanatory.

[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.460]
What is this?

[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:01.560]
Passes?

[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.600]
Oh, for the derral.

[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.720]
Anybody want to go to the golf tournament?

[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.680]
Anybody want these?

[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:07.080]
When is it?

[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:07.980]
A bunch of passes.

[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.340]
It's a weekend.

[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:10.240]
The derral.

[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.500]
This is the big weekend, right?

[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.260]
Run to the Florida Derby and run here.

[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:14.880]
It'll be out there.

[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:15.760]
Here you go, Captain Dave.

[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.460]
He's gonna be out of town.

[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:17.920]
I'm going to the Delta.

[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.260]
I'm so sorry about that.

[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.480]
So anyway, just pass those out to your friends.

[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.060]
We have a river Phoenix story coming up on line six.

[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:25.820]
This ought to be good.

[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.160]
Hello.

[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.280]
Hello, Neil.

[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:27.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.660]
Okay, yesterday's Harold.

[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.560]
In the movie section,

[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.000]
a night in the life of Jimmy Reardon.

[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.560]
Two and a half stars.

[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:35.980]
Yeah.

[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.320]
Due to the performance,

[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.480]
these stars magnetic personality.

[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:43.500]
Really?

[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.120]
You got to be putting me on.

[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.000]
I couldn't have been Bill Cosford.

[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.900]
I don't think it was Cosford.

[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:50.540]
No, thanks.

[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.140]
Cosford would have given it four stars.

[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.160]
He probably would have done it.

[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:54.500]
According to the review,

[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:55.620]
he looks pretty good in the movie.

[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.200]
I got news for you.

[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.060]
He doesn't look good in the poster.

[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.040]
He doesn't look good in the movie.

[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.440]
They must have put a lot of makeup on.

[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:03.400]
He's an ugly kid.

[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:03.920]
I'm sorry.

[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.480]
I hate to burst your bubble.

[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.100]
Well, nothing.

[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:10.360]
Different strokes for different folks.

[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:10.880]
You know what I mean?

[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.420]
Why is such a big change from stand by?

[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.300]
I don't know because he just, you know,

[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.300]
as people get older,

[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.380]
they change and sometimes they change for the better.

[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.840]
And sometimes as they do in Germany,

[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.200]
they take a turn for the worst.

[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.080]
You don't like him because he grew up.

[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.840]
No, I don't like him because he's ugly.

[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.240]
I'm not really all that excited about 12-year-old kids.

[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:28.700]
You know what I mean?

[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.260]
When he was in stand by me,

[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.080]
he was what 12 or 13 years old.

[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:33.040]
Yeah.

[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.920]
And he looked like he had promised

[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.220]
like he was going to blossom out

[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.200]
and be a vera strapping wonderful young man

[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:38.820]
and all of that other.

[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.420]
He's ugly.

[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:41.860]
Anyway, uh,

[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.140]
I found a...

[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.880]
Are you upset over the fact that I think he's ugly?

[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.520]
No, I'm just moving on to another subject.

[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.300]
Okay, because I mean,

[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.960]
my friend who came to the...

[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.580]
to shells that night a week or so ago

[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.920]
brought me this big folder and in one half,

[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:55.880]
there were all these pictures of river phoenix.

[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.020]
And in the other half,

[00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.300]
there were these incredible pictures

[00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.280]
about a dozen of them.

[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.440]
A Pat Peterson, okay?

[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.520]
Now, do you think that I pondered

[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.400]
for a long time which ones I would treasure

[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.180]
and keep and cherish and fondle?

[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.720]
Tough question.

[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.360]
No, I was not a tough question for me.

[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.160]
It was very easy.

[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:11.860]
Moving along.

[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:12.840]
Yes, okay.

[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.220]
I found a actress with a name

[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.820]
that's even better than river phoenixes.

[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:18.780]
Okay.

[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.200]
Last night watching HBO,

[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.340]
I caught the tail end of a movie called Once bitten.

[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:22.860]
Yeah.

[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.880]
And in the cast credits,

[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.480]
it was an actress named Rainbow Shalom.

[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:28.580]
Oh, I like that.

[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.060]
She's very big in on the beach.

[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.340]
I think that's river sister.

[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:39.620]
That sounds like a sherbet flavor you'd find in Israel, doesn't it?

[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.400]
Well, that gets my vote over river phoenix.

[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.400]
Okay, mine too.

[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:45.480]
Thanks a lot.

[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:45.980]
Okay.

[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:46.560]
See you later.

[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.020]
I 58 on Jeta 4.

[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.420]
And we move right along.

[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.760]
That really reflects the way I feel.

[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:55.560]
It's amazing.

[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.740]
WG TV, Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale,

[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.980]
and the Palm Beach's good morning.

[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.440]
It's the Neil Rogers show on Jeta 4.

[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.240]
Are you trying to say that this culent area

[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.900]
this disgusting display is finally catching up to you?

[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.160]
Yeah.

[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:11.940]
Yeah.

[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:13.240]
Oh, that was good.

[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.340]
That was one of each channel.

[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:14.740]
Hey, what?

[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.260]
Okay, let's go back to the good.

[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.960]
Let's talk about synchronicity.

[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.860]
Somebody better call the police speaking of synchronicity.

[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.860]
Let's take a call from Miami.

[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:25.260]
Hello.

[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:26.880]
Hi, Neil. How are you today?

[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:27.160]
Good.

[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:28.860]
Have a question for you.

[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:29.180]
Okay.

[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.300]
You used to be up in Connecticut, weren't you?

[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:35.360]
No, I've never worked in Connecticut or anywhere near there.

[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.160]
The green screen.

[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:36.520]
No.

[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.520]
Okay, next question.

[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:38.840]
Yeah.

[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.160]
Why do you hate women so bad?

[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.300]
I don't hate women at all.

[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:41.500]
What?

[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.400]
But you're always making fun, complaining,

[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.120]
calling up winers.

[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:48.820]
No, I'm not.

[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.240]
We got a lot of male winers too.

[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:55.360]
I mean, I mean, this is a good try for whatever point you're trying to make.

[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:56.240]
Of course, I don't hate women.

[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:57.040]
Why would I hate women?

[00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:58.140]
Well, I don't know.

[00:39:58.300 --> 00:39:59.060]
I'm asking you that.

[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.200]
Well, I don't.

[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.540]
Everybody's taken on an individual basis.

[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:03.920]
Yeah.

[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.240]
People are people, okay?

[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.240]
Whether they're male or female or somewhere in between.

[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.320]
I mean, you know, people are whatever they are.

[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.660]
And we had all those women.

[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.620]
No matter the fact, when we had all the young women calling the show yesterday,

[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:14.740]
I said it was great.

[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:15.400]
It was refreshing.

[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.340]
I thought I was very nice to them.

[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:19.300]
Okay.

[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:20.980]
Well, what are you chuckling about?

[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:21.060]

[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.440]
Why is that so amusing to you?

[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.200]
It just is.

[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.020]
Well, is there a specific incident you want to discuss?

[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.980]
I just think overall in general.

[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:28.720]
I think.

[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.260]
Overall in general once.

[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:32.200]
Oh, in other words, no matter what I say.

[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.440]
Every time I turn it on, you're, oh, god, you're.

[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.320]
No, it's just certain ones like you, okay?

[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.040]
Yeah, she's.

[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.060]
No, it's just certain ones like her that I despise.

[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.420]
Well, she's got a, she's trying to make a point.

[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.500]
In other words, because I'm not, I don't sexually lust after her body.

[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.760]
Therefore, I can't possibly like women.

[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.260]
Mm-hmm.

[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.400]
What a smart ass.

[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.040]
Oh, she is.

[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.200]
It's like Glenn and I are here four hours with you,

[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.960]
four and a half hours with you every day.

[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:56.040]
And I have never heard you say anything deprecating toward women.

[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.860]
No, I don't, I don't like women or dislike women.

[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.040]
I like or dislike people as individuals based on the way they are.

[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.140]
I don't give a damn what they are.

[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:03.560]
She's out of it.

[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.160]
Now, she's just a bitch, that's all.

[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:05.900]
He really is.

[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.180]
Anyway, it's not going to bother me,

[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.040]
because we had a great meal.

[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.700]
10 o'clock on Zeta 4, and let's go to Oral Gables next.

[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.060]
Hello.

[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.320]
Hey, Neil, how they going?

[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:14.960]
Pretty good.

[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:15.720]
You know what this is?

[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:16.140]
No.

[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:16.680]
Adam.

[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.260]
Adam, how you doing, Adam?

[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.440]
You know which one that's the second Adam, the first Adam.

[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.300]
The Adam who, uh, the body builder.

[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:23.360]
The football player.

[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.420]
Yeah, the one whose brother is a pain in the grass.

[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.620]
Right, how they going?

[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.340]
Your brother is really sick, you know that?

[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:28.980]
Way too.

[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.420]
You don't know?

[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:31.100]
No.

[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.360]
Your brother called up Stan a few weeks ago,

[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.260]
and was ragging on me and on the show,

[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.220]
and in the beginning of the call, what is his name?

[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:38.120]
Tony?

[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:38.680]
Tony.

[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.340]
In the beginning of the call, he was Tony.

[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.640]
And by the end of the call, he was you.

[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.600]
He had convinced himself that he was you,

[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.560]
and he had been on my show, and I'm a douchebag,

[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.000]
and all of that.

[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.480]
I mean, the Tony's got some problems.

[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:49.240]
Oh, yeah.

[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:50.960]
He's a little bit full of Neil.

[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.780]
He made, I mean, he fooled Stan.

[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.760]
He made Stan think that he owed some hotel over in the Bahamas.

[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.920]
Stan was believing it.

[00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:58.560]
Really?

[00:41:58.820 --> 00:41:59.960]
Yeah, he recorded that call.

[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.320]
Yeah, well, Tony, I think, looks like

[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.740]
kind of in a fantasy land, doesn't he?

[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.480]
Well, yeah, he's a lot bigger than I am.

[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.820]
He's got a little kind of a macho problem there, too, doesn't he?

[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.100]
Kind of, you know, he's a bit,

[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.440]
believe it or not, his girlfriend's got him under foot.

[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:12.660]
Oh, yeah, she's...

[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:13.940]
She says, jump, she says, I'll hug.

[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.660]
In other words, he's whipped, so to speak, right?

[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:19.240]
Yeah, listen, I saw an ad in the Sunday's Miami Herald

[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:19.760]
in the classified.

[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:20.460]
Yeah.

[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.440]
Or babysitters for girls only,

[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.940]
but the number was 6249400

[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.480]
between the hours of two and six.

[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:28.500]
LAUGHTER

[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:31.040]
Oh!

[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.380]
That's a bottle.

[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.540]
Nah, that's a put on obviously.

[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.260]
It must be from the same people in Kendall

[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:41.520]
who put the other stuff in the high school

[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.900]
results in the sports section.

[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.400]
It must be.

[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:48.220]
Bro, has twin-bited life eateries still just hanging out?

[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.500]
He's still floundering, you know.

[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.720]
Now, you're talking to me, you're saying to me,

[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.400]
have I found a life yet?

[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.020]
Yeah, I'm glad.

[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.660]
And now your brother calls up

[00:42:55.660 --> 00:43:02.020]
And the biggest event in his life and he's still talking about it to this day is that you were on Neil show one day

[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:06.200]
And he thinks it was him. Yeah, and he thinks it was him. He's convinced himself it was him

[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.820]
And you're talking about me not having a life man

[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:13.220]
I don't think you're getting a little sturdy with me because you didn't like me that day

[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:16.160]
You were kind of yeah, Glenn does it like any of the people who come in on the show

[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:20.160]
He's very paranoid about them in defense and in hostile. What did you expect me to do Adam?

[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.600]
Oh, be a little friendly or you're in the smile on camera

[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.700]
Yeah, it was like it was like the day that Jim Schuyler came in from hot 105

[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:29.560]
He was so surly to him and turned his back on him and treated him like a mung-brain

[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:33.040]
Yeah, exactly the same. You know it was exactly the same, no matter of fact

[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:33.820]
It was disgusting

[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.820]
And when you say you'll get all the tension and you know, give me these words

[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.360]
We all know that that's the way it happens

[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.220]
There you go

[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:45.980]
What's that?

[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.020]
What else is new?

[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.800]
That's about it Adam, we're just hanging loose here, you know what I'm saying?

[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:54.520]
Hey, what are you gonna have like a little reunion and have everybody that's been there back on the show?

[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.340]
That's a good idea the only problem is like some of those people abandoned us I think

[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.880]
Do you remember those kids from was it Mimey Springs?

[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.860]
Yeah, oh no, was that from Barrett?

[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.760]
That kid Eric who sent us that picture all the kids in the shower

[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:11.500]
And Johnny, what was that kid's name? Not Johnny Wad? What was that kid's name?

[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.280]
The Wad? Yeah, they kind of we hear once in a great while

[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.660]
But I think those people have flipped out

[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:21.320]
Well, you know what I'm like I'm skippin', well I'm already skippin' school today I'm just kicking back

[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.840]
But you know you go to school and then you can't wait on the phone

[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.220]
Now wait a minute, what does that mean Adam? You're not skipping, you're just kicking back

[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.040]
That's an interesting way of putting it isn't it?

[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:32.760]
Well, I started out the morning like I was gonna go to school

[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.420]
And then I kind of lay on the couch, put up a TV

[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:36.940]
And you start listening to this show

[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:40.260]
Right, and then I called and I said well, I'm out for a first hold on

[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:43.560]
I was kind of sleepy, I got in late last night so

[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.440]
Really, tough night, hi Adam

[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.180]
Oh, so so

[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.060]
Yeah, you gotta do your things when your way of wife still can

[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.720]
Yeah, that's for damn sure

[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:55.860]
Anyway, moving right along

[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:56.460]
Yeah

[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.700]
So listen, give Tony a big hug and a kiss for me

[00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.100]
Okay, you want me to flop spit with him?

[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:02.960]
And no, don't go that far, Howard

[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:04.740]
That's disgusting

[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.120]
And anyway, we, that's a good idea

[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.380]
We'll let you know ahead of time when we're gonna do that reunion thing

[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.100]
We'll have all the people in here including that kid

[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.980]
Remember that kid, the lifeguard that Glenn really got upset?

[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:15.620]
Okay, yeah

[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.300]
Oh, he was, he just decimated that poor guy

[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:22.120]
I think I was just as harmless as a butterfly and he just destroyed him

[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.680]
So we'll have all the, all you guys back

[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.320]
I think little is intimidated baby

[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.420]
Oh yeah, right, yeah he's just distant

[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.920]
Yeah, he's all, in fact he was intimidated by big Dave

[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.440]
In fact, every time big Dave comes on his show he's still intimidated

[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.560]
I believe it

[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.220]
Yeah, okay

[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.280]
Okay, listen Adam, have a great life

[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:38.520]
Okay

[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.540]
And it's good hearing from you

[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:40.320]
Bye-bye

[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.400]
Now are we gonna, you're gonna start getting defensive and surly?

[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:50.000]
I just wondered if we had time today to go through that Jim Schuyler incident again

[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.920]
I think we need to go through it, step by step

[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:55.940]
Since you brought it up again?

[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:56.660]
Captain Dave

[00:45:58.060 --> 00:45:58.460]
Really?

[00:45:59.060 --> 00:45:59.320]
What?

[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.080]
Don't you think we should go through it again?

[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:05.020]
No, I don't think so, I think it's boring and monotonous and we, those of us who...

[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:05.580]
Why do you bring it up?

[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.280]
Those of us who were a party to it, we know the real story

[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.480]
No, I want...

[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:13.680]
Schuyler knows what really happened, he's just a nice guy, he's not gonna rag on you

[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:13.960]
That's...

[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.040]
No, well we don't have to do it today but I would like to go through it again

[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:23.300]
Now what was that thing in the classifieds in a Harold again about babysitter from two to six for girl bully?

[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.540]
I've got sunshine on W-I-N-Z

[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:32.520]
Okay, that's just a little musical hint, that's all you get, we're not playing anymore that crap

[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.640]
Okay, enough is enough

[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:37.640]
And then he was, Stan was on the other day all upset because I let these people...

[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:42.460]
When I take my shots at him, he says it's only very short and sarcastic and to the point

[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:45.140]
And I was letting people go on a great length and ripping him

[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:51.700]
There are those occasions when he does four hours like the one he did two or three days ago that I heard about but I did not hear

[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.940]
What the hell is going on here folks?

[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.900]
I mean it's only, we're just doing a radio show in here, what is that again?

[00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.760]
Is that an instant replay?

[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.400]
They might be the Russians finally

[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:08.260]
Oh yeah, look at that, there are 16 helmeted Russians coming down, oh no, that's the Santa Rhea house, they're going to...

[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.040]
There's a big sign there, it says Chicken Licking

[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:14.520]
Do you believe what's going on back here in this A-Track Room? Who the hell is in there?

[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.000]
That's where it's coming from

[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:15.640]
Who is in there?

[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.880]
It's the Music Director's Room

[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.740]
It's in the Music Director's Room?

[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.240]
It's got the real loud phone system

[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:23.780]
Are you serious?

[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.420]
I think they can even hear that on the air

[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.380]
It's a conno-rad

[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:30.180]
Oh yeah, this is a test for the next 60 seconds

[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:38.040]
Anyway, what were we just discussing before we got distracted?

[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:38.360]
Ripping?

[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.440]
There is so much distraction going on here

[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:46.740]
Oh yeah, and he lets these people go, oh yeah, Niel Sock said, it shows no good, he's not the same anymore

[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:48.440]
We used to love him

[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:53.740]
He lets that go on, on in fun item, okay, forever and ever in the Glen Hills Show with his sidekick

[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:58.100]
And hey, that's fine, you know, more power to him, he's got no listeners left anyways on a dead station

[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:03.080]
But if we have the audacity to let some callers go in, you know, come on a year and take some shots

[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:04.680]
He can't handle it

[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:05.600]
It's true

[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.600]
Shame on you Uncle Stanley, shame on you

[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:12.240]
So we are going to have a show with a topic one of these days when Rose Folger comes in?

[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.980]
Yeah, why didn't you talk to him about it?

[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.940]
No, I just, great idea

[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:17.200]
Yeah, we had mentioned that

[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:17.980]
I like that

[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:20.420]
You like the idea of having Rose Folger come in?

[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:24.500]
Yeah, but not talk about music, something about like the primary or something

[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:28.460]
Now, before we go, we still have, now this was in mono, wasn't it?

[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.660]
Um, probably

[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:31.300]
The little kids

[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.100]
Yeah, you're not going to play that again, are you?

[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.440]
Well, there is school there

[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.120]
See, there are a lot of people who didn't hear the very beginning of the show at a quarter to six

[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.320]
And when you come in and somebody has left a alleged material for you

[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:44.940]
And you put it on the machine assuming that it's something worthy of air play and it comes out like this

[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:52.400]
This is Miss Karen and Miss James, three and four year old class at the JCC in Fort Lwenditz Al

[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.400]
Hmm, yeah

[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.740]
Fighting and good news

[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.940]
Fighting for us

[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:03.940]
Eat your home in touch

[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.320]
I sure did

[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.440]
Bye bye

[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.500]
Captain David, most of my home in town

[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.200]
Fighting for you away

[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:18.060]
We right now do not say bye bye

[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.320]
Why doesn't she have stuff made up for her, her guy show

[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.920]
Why do you think you could play this and the hooters back to back?

[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:31.320]
Uh-huh

[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:33.460]
Well, why is she worrying about this show?

[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.920]
That was a nice gesture

[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.300]
But this is a U.M. class, isn't it?

[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:41.560]
Yeah

[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.820]
Yeah, now this was an F.I.U.

[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:47.420]
Kids at U.M. don't come to class

[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:49.480]
They sit out

[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:56.340]
I tell you, this makes me feel like Mr. Green Jean

[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:56.680]
I do

[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.080]
Bye bye

[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.480]
Yeah, I was excellent, I want to thank whoever that brilliant teacher was

[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:13.360]
And of course, we don't want to leave without, uh, we're not hearing the finale here from our dear friend

[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:22.000]
But the music can sound a lot like someone's picking up on the background on some of the

[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:31.100]
It was that they went through a lot of parties in the 16, 70s and in the 60s I had a stereo that you couldn't tell if it was popcorn

[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:34.580]
Popping, bacon frying or the drum solo from Inagata, Devita

[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:35.840]
Yeah, that's terrific

[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:36.920]
Well, we're going to be continuing

[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.540]
And Ed, man, I'll tell you to be continued tomorrow

[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:44.580]
Here's the first of 16 in a row, on Z4, have a great day and a great life

[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:47.720]
And just remember our slogan on Z4, don't call us, we'll call you
