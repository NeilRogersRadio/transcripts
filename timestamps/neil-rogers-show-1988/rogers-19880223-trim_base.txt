[00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.320]
I'm telling you so.

[00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.220]
Okay, Neil, that's it.

[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.900]
Thank you.

[00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:03.100]
Bye.

[00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.240]
Oh my God.

[00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.400]
You know, if you read it in the hero,

[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.480]
you know, it must be true, right?

[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.220]
I hope she forgave me.

[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.720]
We have the date edition.

[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.240]
How come we don't get a brown edition?

[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.180]
Wasn't my fault.

[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.220]
See, if I subscribed to it,

[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.540]
I could bring it in from the house anymore.

[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.840]
Sorry.

[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.360]
There's an idea.

[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.540]
Mm, sorry.

[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.120]
Mm.

[00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.260]

[00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.520]
I just said it was an idea.

[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.500]
Didn't say it was a good one.

[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.560]
Mm.

[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.900]
Don't give me that.

[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.880]
Good, good, good, good.

[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.640]
I'm going to get the herald.

[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.820]
Is this man out of his line?

[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.620]
Yo, Jay.

[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.080]
All right.

[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.660]
Wait.

[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.960]
Wait.

[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.040]
Wait.

[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.440]
Okay, now let me ask you a question.

[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.760]
Okay.

[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.180]
If you were writing that news story for AP,

[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.800]
would you have written the last sentence quite the same way?

[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.400]
Well, you know, it depends on the circumstances, you know.

[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.900]
Maybe police said, put it out that they just wanted to talk to this kid, you know.

[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.980]
Maybe she's reflecting the police attitude.

[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.500]
Right.

[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.360]
Yeah.

[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.380]
They just thought it might be a little curious.

[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.240]
Well, yeah.

[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.840]
They can't accuse him yet, see?

[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.860]
Or they'll get in trouble.

[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.360]
Well, see, that's probably a very small town.

[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.640]
And police are different in small towns and they are in major cities.

[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.380]
You know what I mean?

[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.780]
Yeah.

[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.500]
Anyway, yeah, anyway, now what are who is loosely Cooper that wrote that review?

[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.800]
I want to lend a Cicero does the budget, the budget restaurants for the herald and loosely

[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.620]
Cooper who used to be a guest in my show until Alice until I put her on a payroll over

[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.760]
there.

[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.220]
Yeah, until they started paying their guests.

[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.160]
Yeah.

[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.340]
But at any rate, she must have done that because she does brown.

[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.300]
Lucy does brown.

[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.040]
You've seen that flick.

[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.620]
Sure.

[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.400]
Couple times.

[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.480]
And I got news for you.

[00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.800]
If Lucy Cooper really believes that this is a three star, Threatoria, she calls it boy.

[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.640]
There's only one thing I can say to you, Lucy.

[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.520]
You be LA.

[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.220]
Okay.

[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.560]
I knew that was going.

[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:08.880]
Yeah.

[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.300]
Well, see, I went through all that trouble.

[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.500]
I might as well use it for something.

[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.400]
23 after not.

[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.120]
I'd say to for it.

[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.200]
We'll be back right after these important words.

[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.540]
Okay, it's 26 past six or nine or 10 or 11.

[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.160]
Isn't that something I really thought it was 26 after six.

[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.000]
I had no idea.

[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.380]
The day of the week, it is what month, what year?

[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.760]
Well, it's been that kind of morning, you know.

[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.780]
And if you missed the 738 o'clock half hour, so did we.

[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.900]
Okay, because we were knocked off the air because the AM here with their new wood,

[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.760]
BS, whatever it is with their new power search power trip, power trip.

[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.640]
I think power search would be a better word for listener search.

[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.640]
They have stole our juice.

[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.100]
Okay.

[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.740]
And they overloaded into circuits with their new one tower thing with their non directional

[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.280]
crap.

[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.520]
And they knocked the whole building off the air.

[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.800]
Okay.

[00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.040]
There was a lovely room with an Arlene Ross backed into the transmitter and hit it with

[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.580]
her with her right cheek.

[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.580]
And it's possible.

[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.740]
That could be true too.

[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.140]
So I should laugh.

[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.600]
I'm.

[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.700]
Yeah.

[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.620]
You were in hysterics.

[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.240]
What do you do?

[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.700]
Well, I wasn't hysterics.

[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.360]
Thank God she's on the air and she can't hear the show.

[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.780]
Who cares?

[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.360]
It's true.

[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.280]
If you'd like to hear the news from Mount Rushmore ladies and gentlemen, tune to 940 on your AM

[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.640]
dial.

[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.860]
Okay, we got a caller from Pontiac Michigan on the line.

[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.200]
Hello.

[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.620]
Hello, Neil.

[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.140]
How you doing?

[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.460]

[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.260]
This one, let you know you do have Michigan fans out here.

[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.560]
From Pontiac, huh?

[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.900]
Yeah, I was born in Pontiac.

[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.840]
What did you do?

[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.700]
Living the silver dome?

[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.460]
No, we lived for a while then and moved Battle Creek and then Williamson.

[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.140]
Battle Creek.

[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.900]
Yeah.

[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.480]
All right.

[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.800]
What a great town it is.

[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.240]
The most famous place in Battle Creek is the railroad tracks.

[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.520]
Am I right?

[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.360]
Yellowwoods.

[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.860]
Yeah, I know.

[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.340]
And Detroit's always been the most happen city in Michigan.

[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.300]
It's not bad about it.

[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.360]
Well, that's because the rest of what, you know, I lived in Kalamazoo for two years.

[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.340]
That's not a bad town.

[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.420]
You've never been to Kalamazoo?

[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.920]
Pretty good town.

[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.840]
Isn't it right next to Grand Rapids?

[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.020]
I mean, no, Battle Creek.

[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.880]
It's right next to Battle Creek, and you're not over there?

[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.660]
No, we always went to the lakes.

[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.320]
Usually I have to gun like.

[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.320]
Oh, yeah, gun like?

[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.120]
I know it very well.

[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.500]
Yeah, he's the stay by all the proves here.

[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.780]
Well, how's the favorite next is?

[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.660]
Yeah, well, maybe you ought to invite Geraldo Rivera to come back and do a show from your house.

[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.500]
Well, I just want to call on it.

[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.760]
I got an idea for you guys.

[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.240]
First 16 on the next next guys show.

[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.920]
Mm-hmm.

[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.120]
A lot of the commercials that you guys missed and the half-hour you're down.

[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.100]
Yeah, that's an idea.

[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.100]
Well, I will think about it.

[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.960]
Just want to call on it.

[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.960]
I like your show a lot.

[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.540]
Thank you.

[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.240]
Did you ever eat a loose finder, Deli and Detroit?

[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.260]
No.

[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.080]
Like I said, I may have been to Detroit a couple times with buddies in school.

[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.340]
I was ages ago and I'm 30 years old.

[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.260]
Don't remember much of it.

[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.060]
Well, believe me, you're better off for it.

[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.780]
Okay, have a great weekend.

[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.600]
Thank you.

[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.980]
Bye-bye.

[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.080]
929 on Zeta 4, the near Roger Show.

[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.720]
So old watch's name, Gonzo will be along.

[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.160]
No, he won't.

[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.800]
10-10.

[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.420]
Mm-hmm.

[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.460]
That's correct.

[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.460]
Why do I keep thinking, what a silly guy I am.

[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.840]
I think he's going to be here at 10 o'clock.

[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.940]
Wishful thinking.

[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.720]
This show goes till 10 after 10 now.

[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.540]
Tell your boyfriend, your girlfriend, or both.

[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.860]
Now today, we should stay till about 10-40 because we missed a half-hour, don't you think?

[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.920]
Can you cut his mic off?

[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.580]
Yeah, that power.

[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.420]
It was just a...

[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.740]
I think he needs a Rick Edwards brain transplant.

[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.020]
Oh, my God.

[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.320]
Hello, judging from what he just said, I think he's already had it.
