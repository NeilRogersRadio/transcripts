[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980]
from time when it wasn't going to come with that but he just came running in here

[00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:10.360]
like a idiot a 26 on Zeta poor now speaking of idiots here is Paul so I have no idea what

[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.620]
this magazine is do you know wait till you hear this this is the January 19th issue for those

[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.820]
who know what it is yesterday morning personality Neil Rogers at Zeta for Miami is ill

[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.380]
some say it could be serious and lingering we hope rumors are not true what meanwhile though his

[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.140]
absence allowed Joey Reynolds at WS a.t. to make some strong headway as the book started Reynolds

[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.400]
with sidekick Bill Marshall never sounded better have you ever heard such crap in your life where

[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.040]
did that come what is this magazine the pulse of broad oh it's another one of those broad chasing

[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.300]
magazines yeah can you believe that they never sounded better well I got news for if he never

[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.400]
sounded better that's a hell of a commentary on his career isn't it because if you listen to him

[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.640]
lightly man it's just like he's going through the motions they forgot to miss him whereas baggy

[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.500]
pants anymore really no they forgot to mention you were sick in between the yeah isn't that interesting

[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.560]
well there were no ratings being taken could be serious and lingering now Joey's problem is serious

[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.660]
in lingering for about 30 years now but that's another story it's called no ratings feels like a

[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.980]
wishful thinking swishful thinking to me I can't believe this from pulse for that out of here

[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.400]
talking about it I knew in x here from today Ronald Reagan will be a former president thank god

[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.060]
for that oh boy throw that out well if we can survive that long that's excellent news 365 days 829

[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.040]
I'd say to four let's go back to the calls and thanks to whoever put that stupid piece of crap

[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.820]
in pulse I have a lingering illness from reading that crap Dave County hello hello how you doing

[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.440]
yeah good I just want to tell you that I got called by one of these rating services last night

[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.720]
might birch Tom birch I don't know who it was but it was really well because the first thing he

[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.820]
started off saying was what's your number one radio music station and without hesitation I said

[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.920]
day to four but I thought this question was kind of loaded by saying number one radio music station

[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.180]
up that you guys don't play music but that's not what your famous work mm-hmm

[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.600]
strange I just try to let you know that also but I heard that you already mentioned that

[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.520]
somebody in the office here said you already mentioned it before but the the reason that all

[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.460]
these women are supposedly listening to uh the lawful stations is because they're piping it

[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.500]
into their brain all day long yeah that's true yeah yeah girl in the office here every time I talk

[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.800]
to her she's got to turn the music down because uh music now that's that is a good point during

[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.880]
tremendous number of women of secretaries and nurses and whatever they work in offices and they

[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.740]
have that crap piped in in the background of their captive audiences and I guess they feel compelled

[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.500]
to write it down in their diaries that they're listening even though they're like passive they

[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.020]
just happen to be there yeah I mean I think they think that that's what music is you know

[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.040]
well I'll tell you one thing if I were an advertiser it would be a cool day in hell before I would

[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.720]
put any I'd buy any advertising on one of those stations that's just like a background a subliminal

[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.680]
kind of a background service because nobody's paying any attention speaking of advertising uh I

[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.760]
I realized the value in the American capitalist system of uh of advertisers and everything and I

[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.720]
won't mention any names that you've put on the air but uh I really hate loud car commercials

[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.400]
and I have to say that's the only time my uh possibly changes channel is when I hear one of those

[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.680]
but uh you've earned you've earned a button on my car's story so my lad that makes it worth

[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.640]
a while okay thanks a lot thank you boy boy 832 i'd say to four and if we've earned a button on his

[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.740]
thing that can't be all bad right that's good news we all want to earn a button that's right

[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.520]
like this one here that says get a life that's my that's my button right we have an open line

[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.640]
in date 620 3600 that's our date county number and of course if you live in date county that's

[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.540]
probably the one you ought to dial all or you can always dial a brown number sure

[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.660]
like if you're messed up in the brain like if you're a moron those are the kind of colors we love

[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.080]
and if you're joining us at midstream our subject for the day has been brain surgery for pigmies

[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.460]
now seriously we're talking about uh what our good dear friend on am was discussing yesterday

[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.380]
of course he only uh talked about a little bit of it because he didn't want to fess up that am

[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.500]
is dead now we've already taken that as a given because you notice most of these people now the

[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.620]
couple of mentioned allis or whatever but very few of these people talk about am because am is

[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.220]
passe it's finnie at least in this market dead d ed boy it went down quick to didn't it

[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.760]

[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.980]
what you say you can have cherries jubilee never mind never mind sir just keep rolling man you're

[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.820]
on a real roll now what is your story hello me in other words what is it you want to tell us

[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:46.060]
sir besides funky white boy get down wedr whatever rap crap what is he want to say i don't know

[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.220]
how about goodbye that would be a good start 27 till nine on zeta four now one of the interesting

[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.240]
things in the book now stand keeps talking about the numbers and it's it i want to tell you stand

[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.060]
because i know you're listening to the show either now or on tape it's embarrassing okay i mean

[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.200]
it's one thing when the numbers come out we've always traditionally whether they're great or

[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.520]
mediocre whatever always talked about them for the whole market and for the art own show but

[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.700]
after the you know the 10th week it gets a little bit old you know what i'm saying well we got

[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:17.980]
27,000 254 man and we got you know i mean give it a rest but one of the interesting things is

[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.340]
we were kind of like all the way across consistent right around a four which means we did

[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.900]
better than that because that included that horrible month when we were in here in October but

[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.720]
the last hour i would have thought in the nine o'clock hour would have been comparable to what i

[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.520]
used to do on a.m. you understand what i'm saying because there's nothing else really going on

[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.920]
and one has to wonder what it is between nine and ten you follow what i'm saying that should be

[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.940]
a monster hour for the show and it's not it's not the big hour it was not a bad hour but it's not

[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.700]
the big hour. It was very big as it was closed but it was not a gigantic monster hour which

[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.860]
it ought to be. Well you think it's got to be that sandy patent factory. Oh yeah that's

[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.260]
true i forgot about it we're up against a most stiff competition and probably the collectibles

[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.800]
guys been on a couple of times during that book that well man you can't you can't beat that collectibles

[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:11.600]
we can't even begin to. How sandy i've got a 1902 toaster that's run by kerosene

[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:19.720]
let's have a punch toast for sandy okay like right in the mouth well she is she is so bad you know

[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.840]
she she to me she is the epitome of radio in this market mediocrity yeah mediocrity she is so

[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.320]
bland and so mediocre and so boring and so repetitive and so just absolutely vanilla

[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:38.140]
and that's she's the epitome of the broadcast media in this market just bland and totally useless

[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.520]
quintessential vanilla program and here's Bobby bland on zeta four Bobby blue bland right

[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.860]
okay let's go to broward county hello yes mad flasher yeah that's what i figured

[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.980]
how do you figure because i saw i saw on the phone line that there was a little rubber rain code

[00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:01.780]
what do you think of my show not not much i think you you and stan have both given new meaning

[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:08.000]
to the word no show i'm thinking about flashing the santeria house next what do you think well listen if

[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.800]
you value your chickens sir i would keep it keep it at home you want another show no enough was

[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.680]
enough enough was enough yeah there's more to show you though well i don't want to see it's okay

[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.880]
okay what do you mean if you know johnny depths home address give us the number but that's about

[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.800]
a pretty we have an open line in brown and seven i think i comes up here you remember that

[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.800]
how can i forget stupid little brown car and a drove up here and a guy came running up

[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:39.060]
and he opened up his raincoat and he had on like some stupid shorts and t-shirt or whatever

[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:44.260]
i mean not like not undershorts but regular shorts with thank god because he was ugly and

[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:49.000]
and he opened the coat and stuck his tongue out like a mad lunatic and ran back into car and a

[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.620]
drove out then he came back in again and you know i mean what it again did it yeah i think

[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:59.220]
the new rule is going to be we don't want any ugly people flashing in our window okay i think it's

[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.660]
poignant that the thing that sticks out in your mind most of all is the color of the car so that

[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:08.260]
i'll give you that was that that was the most memorable part of the whole situation okay does that

[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:14.980]
answer your question sir that's not too good uh date county hello a new yeah is his Jose yeah Jose

[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.760]
right on the the very edge right on the razor's edge of going over the brink yeah well

[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.060]
mentally you coming through loud and clear yeah i'm going to solve that though because i'm going to

[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.940]

[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:53.920]
like pretended like they didn't know what it was of course you know they did and i just know it was the egg

[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.620]
because of the hang up you know oh yeah what do you have a lot of good bursting there and

[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:05.720]
not so Alice was bursting yeah man probably too much strength to force feed you that little kid bit

[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:10.820]
that's pretty exciting yeah so he does have a sidekick now in other words i'm correct that be

[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:16.560]
Alice yeah yeah that's pretty revolution yeah but i just want you to let you know and i can't

[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:22.340]
i can't stand the phone very well okay well say goodbye oh goodbye bye okay that's excellent a little

[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:26.980]
a tidbit from one of our zeta radio spies it's eighteen before nine and there's an open line in brown

[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.420]
and seven seven nine thirty six hundred i will say this in fact there there really aren't any

[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.640]
open line they just to go and nuts here today it's been a wild topic and you know why

[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:39.020]
because these people are pissed yeah okay they're sick and tired of being turned off by these music

[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:44.720]
programmers who don't know they're grass from their elbows you know i saw i saw the music director

[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:50.920]
smoking an elbow i'm serious it was frightening but you know the stand was not begging for calls just

[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.820]
that's true plenty of the i called in at the other show and i said you finally got a good topic

[00:14:54.820 --> 00:15:00.260]
and it's about time struck a nerve or something yeah and i'm delighted he had all those herman

[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.360]
and McQueen fans call it in all three of them i think all of them work the gtr by the way

[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:10.660]
because from that first call it was such an obvious setup oh no that was it now i most listeners

[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.720]
say we uh do this and we do that you know when they're referring to a particular radio station

[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.640]
and then they say oh no i don't work there i'm just a fan oh yeah just part of the fan club

[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:25.000]
mm-hmm bulldozer like the program director something like that what does that say caller number five

[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.020]
gizantite captain mong hello hello nil yes sir i'm a royal listener and i've been listening to you so

[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:37.280]
uh morning this morning wow and uh i want to touch upon a couple things first of all

[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:44.020]
touch this um not right that's just a joke sir hi i understand first of all uh not to stick up for

[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:49.700]
captain Dave but voices by rest ballot happens to be a staple at a or a radio no wait a minute he

[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:54.080]
didn't say though he never heard of it either that was a caller who said that oh that was a caller

[00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:00.420]
yeah okay it happens to be a very heavily requested song i don't know the song i don't

[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.740]
think they're fast you know i mean i'm not suggesting that i'm the the maven on music i don't know the record

[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:10.360]
okay uh maybe if i heard it i might recognize it okay because there are those all of us have

[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.880]
records that we don't know the title of the artist but we could recognize the song

[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:20.300]
mm-hmm that's a very good possibility yep uh next thing is what i don't understand is that when a station

[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:27.780]
has pretty much for lack of a better term garbage for ratings right data yeah um why the consultant

[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:34.280]
why bring someone in from another part of the country to tell you what has to be played where

[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.180]
do you want me to give you do you want me to give you a very frank and honest answer about that when

[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:43.860]
when any radio station or television station in america brings in a consultant any of them you know

[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.700]
what it tells me it tells me that the management doesn't know what the hell they're doing well

[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.700]
obviously i mean if you hire me to be the manager or program director and i go out and i hire a

[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.560]
consultant then i shouldn't have been hired in the first place because the only reason i should have

[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:03.080]
that job is because i have expertise in programming absolutely absolutely and because i know the market

[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.160]
as you say i mean how the hell can somebody in filanalfia tell us what's popular and what's going to

[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.400]
play in Miami it's the most ridiculous thing i've heard in my life thing go yet these guys are making

[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.820]
fortunes and and we're not yeah they ought to tell these consultants to stick it where the

[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.760]
moon don't trying to take their contract i mean all you got to do is look at what their track record

[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.660]
has been the only numbers at this station's head has been with us in the morning we've only been here

[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:30.180]
for two months right two and a half months from what i understand too a lot of the stuff that

[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:39.000]
data is doing is very very similar as a matter of fact lighter for liner almost to what k rock's

[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.940]
doing in new york really yeah a friend of mine was just down from new york this jockey and one of

[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:51.340]
the fms up there who was who is from this market and he was here for a week listen to data and

[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:56.280]
basically said that you guys are doing exactly what k rock is doing well they must have some pretty

[00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:01.740]
crappy numbers after howard gets off don't they do i don't know they do because he was on he was on

[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.820]
letterman last night and howard said that the rest of the station is a disaster i don't know if he

[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:10.840]
was just kidding or something it's in the two yeah yeah so far you guys that's right see the

[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:15.920]
two more quick things they only wish they were in the two that is um you we were talking about new

[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:22.660]
music in in the format and you had said that mtv you know they even have a block of new music yeah new

[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:28.460]
music that they the new videos that they do when their new music hour are also in somewhat of a

[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:36.180]
rotation all in program is read cg for child rental guidance kitchen slide weather and out their

[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:41.580]
parents should be allowed to listen because boy this show is really stupid

[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:50.260]
so are you here you look punk do your homework

[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:02.280]
mama heads that's high hopes for i still say that that you know we have i don't know eight

[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.720]
nine hundred cds in this building in our library and the number of them that actually get played you

[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.120]
could put in the thimble and have room left over for the chinese army and that's that's the problem

[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.600]
right we were talking before about simply read and the fact okay so they only had two hits but they

[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:20.060]
were both very very good a or records they fit our format perfectly and you know there's so many

[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.820]
groups and artists who fit into that category that you'll never hear that we don't play on his station

[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:30.080]
and if we would be playing them there would be less of the field collins and less of the ccr and less

[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.220]
of the john cougar and less of the repetition and and people would stick with it more well i hate to

[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:41.240]
disagree with you um as good as those simply read records are i don't think you could pigeon them

[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:46.140]
hold as a or records i think more of a well let me say this to you if little lies by fleet would

[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:49.980]
mac and i hate to keep using that but that's one of the best examples if that's an a or record and

[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.840]
certainly money's too tight to mention is all right well if you put it all the whole concept of that

[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.200]
record it's a counter culture it's an anti-establishment record how can it not be an a or record

[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:06.380]
how can it not fit maybe maybe it just doesn't maybe i'm trying to pigeonhole it is not being a rock

[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:12.920]
and roll record i don't agree with you at all um finally um you are having trouble getting

[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:19.580]
casing the sunshine band records yeah okay uh i have an original casing the sunshine band

[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:25.280]

[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:45.320]
uh a couple of people got bent out of shape did they i think so i mean yesterday what we did i guess

[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:50.320]
was really revolutionary when i put three kc records in the same i guess we played almost four

[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.040]

On the same board

No one's lost, we lose now

[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.860]
They don't tell it all

[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:56.680]
And now I'm out of the sky

[00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:00.940]
Just like the end of the night

[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:04.900]

No one's gonna be there for all

[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:36.680]
We go in and our arms are free

[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.660]
Come and grow me

[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:45.460]
