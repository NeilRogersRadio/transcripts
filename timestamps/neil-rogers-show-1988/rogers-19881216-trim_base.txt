[00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.540]
This is Neil Roger.

[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.700]
That is your brain.

[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.600]
Any questions?

[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.800]
Yeah, we got a lot of questions.

[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.600]
You know, yesterday,

[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.200]
remember everybody was calling it,

[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.420]
I got a couple of questions.

[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.160]
Remember that?

[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.960]
Question, man.

[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.920]
I'm sick and tired of that, man.

[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.900]
We'll ask the goddamn questions, okay?

[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.700]
Anyway, it's 10.05 at W.I.O.D.

[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.240]
Sound like Uncle Michael is having a real good time down there in the Bahamas

[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.140]
and I have a feeling that the good time is just beginning.

[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.320]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.020]
I have a feeling he's going to really have a hot weekend over there.

[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.700]
Anyway, we got four hours to kill here today and then Steve is coming along at the two nights.

[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.940]
Do you think Steve has a guest today?

[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.780]
You know, I think.

[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.740]
I'm going to talk about his show yesterday because that,

[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.140]
I listen to a lot of it, did you?

[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.580]
No.

[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.860]
Man, I am getting so tick with these, with these old parts.

[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.660]
Really?

[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.040]
Something's got to be done.

[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.160]
I mean, it's one thing to talk about it, but something has got to be done.

[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.880]
And that Alan Becker, he's on my list now.

[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.680]
I used to like him.

[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.520]
In fact, I remember when he ran, what did he run for?

[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.020]
He ran for a couple of things and always lost.

[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.760]
He ran for, oh, he ran against Larry Smith in the Democratic primary for Congress.

[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.940]
Remember many years ago?

[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.200]
Yeah.

[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.460]
First time Larry ran.

[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.360]
That was a while ago.

[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.780]
And, well, I'll tell you, thank God that he didn't win.

[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.840]
Now that I look at it, in fact, I supported him then.

[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.620]
I supported Alan Becker because I didn't know Larry too well back then.

[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.320]
Well, Steve's got open phones today.

[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.180]
Really?

[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.020]
Great. So we're excited about that.

[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.140]
But anyway, Alan is the con, one of the condo attorneys,

[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.900]
and of course, Caller, hit it right on the head.

[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.460]
You know, these guys are raking in the books.

[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.880]
And that's what it's all about.

[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.560]
It's not protecting the law.

[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.840]
That's, that's, there's so many laws that aren't enforced.

[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.340]
And laws that should be off the books.

[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.260]
And that one's going to be changed anyway.

[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.160]
You know, the law about these adult-only complexes.

[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.680]
Did you hear what they were doing in some of the condos?

[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.740]
Because the law is going to change this spring.

[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.320]
They were sending little forms around to everybody in the mail telling them that when the questionnaire comes to them,

[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.300]
that they should put down the age of the oldest person who lives there in a condo.

[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.640]
Because the law will require that in condos when are over a certain percentage, 80% or over 55,

[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.420]
then they can keep young people out.

[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.360]
So in other words, let's get the, the median age up to 100.

[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.360]
And then we can keep all those horrendous young people under the age of 200 out of the building.

[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.500]
That makes me want to puke.

[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.400]
I'm sick and tired of that.

[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.520]
Nauseated, revolted.

[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.380]
And then Henry is going on vacation.

[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.540]
He just said for a week.

[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.760]
And Sonny is going to Hawaii.

[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.820]
What the hell is going on here?

[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.980]
You think these people had been here a while or something, right?

[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.640]
We've been here six weeks already.

[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.640]
We're not going anywhere.

[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.160]
All right.

[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.860]
That's, you know, I could do a whole show on Steve's show yesterday.

[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.480]
Yeah.

[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.420]
But that would be wrong, right?

[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.160]
Would it be wrong?

[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.340]
Yeah, probably.

[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.460]
Waste the time?

[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.420]
No, it would not be a waste of time.

[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.140]
Any opportunity to rip the old parts is not a waste of time.

[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.740]
Good point.

[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.980]
Disgusting behavior.

[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.760]
And this, you know, Steve brought up so many good points in some of the other people

[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.320]
to do the idea that they can exclude young people.

[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.540]
You can discriminate against people because of age, but not because of their race or their religion.

[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.660]
That's a lot of malarque.

[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.980]
Yeah.

[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.000]
That didn't make any sense.

[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.620]
Oh, here's the first trickle of male.

[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.380]
I remember yesterday there was like this.

[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.220]
There was a little tiny trickle of male.

[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.100]
And I kept saying, okay, where's the real male, okay?

[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.420]
And then we got two cartons full of male.

[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.320]
And I hope that doesn't happen again today because fat rich is not here.

[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]
You may have to come in and help us open the male.

[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.480]
Hey, man.

[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.220]
Is that a deal, Sharon?

[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.380]
Okay.

[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.000]
We got the Allenburg picture here.

[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.760]
So you'll be okay.

[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.660]
Yeah, you can look at the Dean picture there.

[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.000]
It'll make you feel like old times.

[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.680]
Now, what is that?

[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.720]
Is that another carton?

[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.780]
Or is that the one that rich had?

[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.600]
What is that?

[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.660]

[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.340]
Oh, that's the food.

[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.440]
Oh, they put that in the...

[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.640]
Oh, yeah, that's my chicken soup.

[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.680]
No, the Rick Essen deli, by the way, brought food by today.

[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.340]
And we want to thank them very much for that.

[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.200]
And I was good.

[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.480]
I looked at it downstairs.

[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.320]
They brought stuffed cabbage, which looked incredible.

[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.400]
And all kinds of good stuff.

[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.160]
But I'm sure Linda, a Nutra system, was listening.

[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.760]
And if I went off the thing just a little bit again today, she would say,

[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.720]
go nuts, you know.

[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.500]
So I'm not going to do that.

[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.560]
I'm not going to do it a second day in a row.

[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.860]
As Don Johnson would say, I'm definitely not going to do that.

[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.880]
Well, look at this.

[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.160]
Somebody said, I don't understand this.

[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.520]
There's a check, and there's cash, and there's all kinds of hazerai in here.

[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.940]
But anyway, this is just the beginning of opening up the mail, right?

[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.380]
Yeah.

[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.520]
All right, let's give those numbers out, because I'm sure we've got a lot of old parts

[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.160]
that want to call in today and talk about how terrible it is to have children around.

[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.260]
And then we'll do an hour where they can talk about how bad it is to have blacks around.

[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.460]
And how bad it is to have Jews around.

[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.500]
And whatever other group that they want to discriminate against and keep out.

[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.200]
Because they're miserable and nasty and filthy and subhuman and disgusting.

[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.300]
And some of the callers, even some of the younger callers yesterday, turned my stomach.

[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.380]
Well, I can see both sides.

[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.660]
If they want to have complexes or they have only certain buildings,

[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.700]
where people are allowed to have children, that would be fine.

[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.260]
And then you know, I'm lived in those.

[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.660]
Oh, sure.

[00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.180]
I've lived in the young building.

[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.380]
But not to have a whole complex.

[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.460]
And they talk about how kids make noise.

[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.840]
I told you about my mother's complex where the guy upstairs.

[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.380]
I call them the elephant man Jr.

[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.400]
Because this guy clops and clops and clops.

[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.840]
And every time I go over to my mother's, you sit in there trying to talk or watch TV.

[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.060]
And you hear clop.

[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.420]
And it sounds like the guy is going crazy up there.

[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.340]
Like he's dropping typewriters on the floor.

[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.040]
I know.

[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.140]
Like he's dropping his fax machine on the floor.

[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.620]
That's right.

[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.340]
Anyway, it's 1010 at WIOD and we'll come back in just a second.

[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.380]
I don't want maybe we'll do a whole show on that because I'm so agitated.

[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.800]
Historical, apoplectic.

[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.320]
You?

[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.000]
Me.

[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.420]
Well, you know that's unusual for me.

[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.960]
Hey, listen, get yourself a boy.

[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.760]
I hate man.

[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.820]
You know what Tanner did this morning.

[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.900]
It's 1014.

[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.600]
Another one I did.

[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.740]
Who's on vacation?

[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.120]
Tanner.

[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.880]
Tanner is?

[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.940]
I wonder why we haven't gotten this $5,000 check yet for Camilo sauce, but I'm sure it's on the way.

[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.400]
Okay, it's 1014 at WIOD.

[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.260]
And like I said, I could scream and get hysterical.

[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.200]
It isn't going to do any good.

[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.620]
You're right.

[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.400]
Because those people aren't going to change.

[00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.440]
The one good thing is a lot of them are going to die.

[00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.560]
Hopefully very soon.

[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.880]
Very soon.

[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.320]
Like by the end of the show maybe.

[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.660]
Okay.

[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.260]
And I'll be happy to help plant them in the ground.

[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.760]
And then we can bring some living and breathing people under the age of maybe like 98.

[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.180]
People who aren't on the Willard Scott's weather on NBC.

[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.680]
Okay.

[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.260]
Those are the people who should be eligible to move to Florida.

[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.960]
We got enough old people already.

[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:18.480]
Okay.

[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.240]
So right to all your grandparents and your great grandparents tell them to stay to how where they are.

[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.620]
All right.

[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.600]
Don't bring them down here.

[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.460]
Man, I can't stand that.

[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.060]
See what a lot of people do up north.

[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.560]
A lot of these middle-aged people, yuppies and younger people.

[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.080]
They pack up their parents and grandparents to get in the hell out of the way.

[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.520]
And they ship them down here.

[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.900]
I know.

[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.100]
Like in crates, you know, they just ship them here.

[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.680]
And then of course the first thing they do, just like the illegal aliens, they go out and they buy a big car.

[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.720]
They go out and buy a battleship.

[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.420]
They've never driven.

[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.280]
They used to use the subway and the bus and taxis all their life.

[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.940]
And they come down here and they buy a battleship.

[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.960]
See, I used to think that was a law.

[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.100]
You talk about laws.

[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.520]

[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.620]
Yeah.

[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.600]
When they come here, it's got to be a continental or a catalyze.

[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.620]
That's got to be one of those two.

[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.160]
Okay.

[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.380]
We got a mobile on five here.

[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.640]
Hello.

[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.280]
Yeah.

[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.940]
Uncle Nail.

[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.380]
Yes, sir.

[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.260]
How you doing?

[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.700]
Okay.

[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.820]
I was building it.

[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.000]
Great.

[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:07.880]
Great.

[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.360]
It's about horror stories to tell you.

[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.240]
Sounded like a young younger.

[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.480]
I am.

[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.920]
Don't panic, no, sir.

[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.660]
I know you're a little nervous, but never the less.

[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.180]
I'm in traffic right now.

[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.600]
Front of mine is clothing development.

[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.280]
And the store that he works for had nine boxes of brand new clothing.

[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.780]
He packaged them up.

[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.800]
I went down yesterday to pick them up, taking the Camila's house.

[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.100]
Yeah.

[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.780]
And I asked the owner of the store, you know, where's the clothing?

[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.640]
I was supposed to pick up.

[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.200]
Oh, well, we threw them out.

[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.140]
Why did you throw it?

[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.900]
Why did you, you know, why did you trash them?

[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.880]
Well, you know, us giving that clothing to the homeless is just encouraging it.

[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.940]
Oh, that's great.

[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:51.620]
Yeah.

[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.820]
That's like saying feeding starving people is like encouraging starvation, yeah.

[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:56.200]
Right.

[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.100]
Well, it's like that 40-year-old old bag that is running for waterdale.

[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.800]
I mean, single handedly, yeah.

[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.480]
That's what he's like.

[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.620]
This lady had to be her twin.

[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.540]
I am so disgusted with for waterdale.

[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.280]
I've lived here.

[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.880]
It's enough to make you puke, isn't it, sir?

[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.580]
Uh, worse than puke.

[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.740]
I mean, you know, used to drive down the strip and see all those college students and young people.

[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.460]
Now there are a bunch of people on walkers on the strip in for waterdale.

[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.000]
Well, I am so sick of this place.

[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.480]
It's like I'm ready to go get a high colonics.

[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:26.980]
Okay.

[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.660]
Hey, listen, that sounds like I'm making an exciting weekend for you, pal.

[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.520]
Hey, guy.

[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.740]
Could I open up a whole new avenue for you, what I mean?

[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:33.460]
All right.

[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.160]
Well, tell the duck behind you, there.

[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.460]
Okay. Good luck to you, sir.

[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:36.760]
All right, bye.

[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:37.320]
Okay.

[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.480]
Well, what a way to start, huh?

[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.240]
We've got a couple of open lines indeed.

[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.780]
People really impatient this morning.

[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.160]
We're taking our damn sweet time.

[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:43.480]
Okay.

[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.340]
When we're ready, we'll let you know.

[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.100]
And will you take that picture of Alan Burke and get it off the table already?

[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.220]
It is a full-page ad in the Philadelphia bulletin or whatever that is.

[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:52.840]
What is a paper?

[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.060]
Philly, daily news.

[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.440]
Like I said, the daily news.

[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.000]
And he's just started there a couple of weeks ago.

[00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:58.540]
Mm-hmm.

[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.640]
And he's already got a full-page ad in the paper.

[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:01.920]
Where is our full-page ad?

[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.360]
Even in like the weekly news or something.

[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.260]
I don't see anything.

[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.860]
The weekly news.

[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]
Well, that would be a start.

[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.320]
Okay, that date number 751, W-I-O-D, that 751-9463.

[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.560]
Probably everybody's congregating at Point East this morning.

[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.540]
That's probably why date is a little bit slow.

[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.040]
When he get out of Point East, then it'll be okay.

[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:20.900]
I thought about that.

[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.200]
Bokeh, hello.

[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.220]
Hey there, boys.

[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.500]
It's the Bokeh Fetch.

[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.260]
How you doing?

[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:26.840]
Okay.

[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.300]
What do you mean the Bokeh Fetch?

[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.800]
That's what you told me to call myself.

[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.200]
Okay.

[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.400]
The Bokeh Fetch.

[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.040]
Well, I could be anybody in Bokeh sir.

[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.080]
The Bokeh Fetch Jr.

[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.480]
I thought I'm the real one.

[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:37.940]
Okay.

[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.280]
Now, I got two stories for you.

[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.540]
I had a TV accident.

[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.840]
Oh, wait, hold on a second, okay?

[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:43.120]
Yeah.

[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:43.660]
Hold on.

[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.560]
Now, are you really mobile here?

[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.420]
Yeah, I'm mobile.

[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.200]
Okay, we'll get that.

[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:47.720]
Wait a minute.

[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.760]
Oh, I just cut him off.

[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.140]
Are you still there?

[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:50.860]
Yeah, we're back.

[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.340]
Okay, I punched off instead of a hole.

[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.360]
I almost cut you off, pal.

[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.000]
Hold on a minute.

[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.020]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:55.820]
I'm here.

[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:56.300]
Okay.

[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.220]
Can I talk to you now?

[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:57.540]
Yeah.

[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.900]
I got a great idea.

[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.940]
I know you don't do requests.

[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:01.620]
That's correct.

[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.000]
And especially not today.

[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.320]
Not after hearing that show yesterday.

[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.360]
I can't blame you.

[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.200]
Not after hearing that little nine-year-old harmless girl being, you know,

[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.420]
they're getting ready to throw her in those people out on the street.

[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.960]
I can't believe this.

[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.220]
Because there are a bunch of subhuman douchebags, sir.

[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.400]
Goes without saying.

[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:24.580]
But my idea was this, how about if we play a request for those people that spend $25 to

[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.240]
the community house?

[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:25.420]

[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:25.580]

[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:27.980]
I think it's a great idea.

[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.060]
Oh, I'm glad you do.

[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:29.960]
We're not going to do that.

[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.600]
We might do that one day next week.

[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.100]
Not today.

[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.240]
I don't mean it's not a good idea.

[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.380]
We just aren't going to do it today.

[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.820]
We should do it after Christmas.

[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:36.520]
Okay.

[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.080]
Because that's when people start to think that you're directing the show now.

[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.360]
We'll do it any day you pick.

[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:40.880]
How's that?

[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.260]
Whatever day you're in the mood for it, okay?

[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.280]
Even if we hate it, even if we're not in the mood at all, we've got millions of things we want to say.

[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.600]
The day that you decide, that's the day we'll do it, okay?

[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.560]
Because we're agreeable here.

[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.260]
The 26th?

[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:53.620]
26th?

[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.520]
Monday, the day after Christmas.

[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.920]
I don't know if we work that day, either.

[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.520]
Either way.

[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.640]
But if we do, I doubt it.

[00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.780]
What do you mean we better work that day?

[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.080]
I have to work that day.

[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.420]
No, I don't have to work that day.

[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.160]
I'll work whenever they tell me I have to work.

[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:04.740]
Not you.

[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.380]
If I have to do that day, I have to work that day.

[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.260]
Here's another guy who's going to direct the show now.

[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.040]
All right.

[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.320]
Neil, have a great day.

[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.380]
It is a good idea, sir.

[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.960]
Just don't take it personally, okay?

[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.680]
I wouldn't ever do that.

[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.240]
Have a good day.

[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:14.620]
All right.

[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.540]
Now you're still there, right?

[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.280]
Yeah, I'm here.

[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.200]
Okay, hold on a second.

[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:17.920]
Okay?

[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.560]
Well, no, I've got to do a break here.

[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.480]
I want to...

[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.260]
No, no, wait a minute.

[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.860]
I want to give you something to...

[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.200]
Listen, I want to give you something to kvets you about, okay?

[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:25.740]
All right.

[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.240]
Hold on.

[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.640]
I'm telling you, I promise.

[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.420]
As soon as we come back, I might get...

[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.360]
I'm kvets you in my pants.

[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.120]
I bet you are.

[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:31.720]
Hold on a second.

[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.060]
Okay, 20 minutes.

[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:34.200]

[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.620]
Folks missed a really good stuff during the breaks.

[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.700]
They're really hot stuff.

[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.260]
And one of these days, what we'll do is we'll just leave it on.

[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:41.020]
Yeah.

[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.160]
When we have AM stereo, and we can have the spots playing in one channel

[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.340]
and a really good stuff out of the other channel.

[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.600]
Boka, hello.

[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:47.980]
Yeah.

[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.140]
Hold on to you again, yeah, I'm sorry.

[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:49.760]
It's me.

[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.260]
Oh, you want to hold on a second?

[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:51.680]
No!

[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.100]
I'm just a joke.

[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.160]
Oh, you didn't...

[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:55.580]
Wait a minute.

[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.700]
What do you mean your phone bill?

[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.620]
Is this costing you?

[00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:58.780]
Well, yeah.

[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.800]
My time is my money.

[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.500]
Oh, I see.

[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.580]
Excuse me, all right.

[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.720]
Now I'm an important man.

[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.100]
Well, don't kfets you to us, sir.

[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:05.440]
All right.

[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.540]
Listen, I had this television accidently.

[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:07.920]
Yeah, that's the other night.

[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:08.320]
Mm-hmm.

[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.720]
And I'm turning on a wise guy in Jerry Lewis' on there.

[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.060]
Yeah, that is an accident.

[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.560]
Anytime you see Jerry Lewis, it's a major accident.

[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.640]
But the thing is, he's playing, you know what a rag merchant is?

[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.320]
Yeah, somebody who has a shop on Schmattaro and Hellendez.

[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.260]
Yeah, but he's playing the nutty rag merchant.

[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:24.760]
Mm-hmm.

[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.100]
And he's stealing your material.

[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:26.840]
Is he?

[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.200]
Absolutely said on there.

[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.440]
Uncle Mick have a nice bookus.

[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.260]
They said it on the air.

[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:34.780]
Did he really?

[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.560]
Yeah, Jerry Lewis.

[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.040]
Well, he's run out of material a long time.

[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.740]
Since Dean left, he ran out of material.

[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.400]
I couldn't believe it.

[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.620]
Since the Dean went to Philadelphia.

[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.540]
I know, he's the living boy.

[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.960]
And the Dean was on wise guy.

[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:45.880]
One thing.

[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.440]
Yeah, he, now you see how this fits together.

[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.800]
I've always said that man.

[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.460]
I think a little piece is in a puzzle.

[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:52.380]
They all fit together.

[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.000]
But it's sort of like it's a long way down, you know what I mean?

[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.600]
It is a long way down.

[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:57.980]
You're right.

[00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.580]
And real far.

[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.080]
And by the way, do you have any like secret police?

[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.600]
Like Neil Rogers secret police.

[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.320]
Oh yeah, they're all over town, man.

[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.000]
Well, you know, you have to do a whole bunch of them at win-mour right now.

[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:10.380]
Yes.

[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.720]
Now seriously, they're going to be checking for prints on the sweet and low.

[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.660]
They're going to go into every condo man and I'm telling you,

[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.400]
the punishment is going to be swift and severe.

[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.620]
Well, I think we should start like a Neil Rogers,

[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.740]
Tom Tom McCool or something like that.

[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.140]
Yeah, because they were tearing down the Zeta Force.

[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.080]
I guess, Stan, on I-95.

[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.160]
Well, you probably haven't heard much about baby doc lately, have you?

[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:31.580]
No.

[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.020]
We got him hidden away right over here.

[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.720]
In fact, Henry Burrow's got him in the newsroom under wraps.

[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.120]
Good.

[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:38.060]
All right, man.

[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.940]
That laugh, I'm telling you, you're getting this sound like Paul Jr.,

[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.600]
just a little bit.

[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:42.960]
Right, what kind of laugh is that?

[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.480]
That was like a sinister laugh.

[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.660]
Yeah, it was a sinister contrivel laugh.

[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.400]
I made the contrivel laugh for the cane show, okay, sir.

[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.500]
My grandmother listened to the cane show yesterday.

[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.840]
She was very, very upset.

[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:55.660]
What is she really?

[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.860]
What is she in old fart, too?

[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.360]
She's old, but she's a great lady, you know?

[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.020]
Yeah, the great old fart.

[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.700]
She's the place baseball with me.

[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.120]
Really?

[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.380]
And she was staying at Century Village.

[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.480]
And we were listening to the cane show, and she was getting very aproplastic.

[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:10.620]
Yeah, how bet you were.

[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.300]
I mean, she said, you better cop when you go home.

[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.340]
Okay, listen, I think you ran out of material about three minutes ago, okay?

[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:16.980]

[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:17.740]
Good day.

[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.560]
Now listen, you know, the thing of it is, you remember when I did the show

[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.240]
was a long time ago with the couple from, was it Tamarack?

[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.460]
Tamarack?

[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:26.840]
Bonnie.

[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.280]
What was their name?

[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.700]
The wife's name was Bonnie Pomerance.

[00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:31.640]
Pomerance?

[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:31.960]
Remember?

[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:32.660]
No.

[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.120]
Oh, what was it about?

[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:34.880]
What a douchebag.

[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:35.920]
I can't.

[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.520]
Bonnie Pomerance and her husband and they were being kicked out because they had a baby,

[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:44.100]
and it was in one of these complexes in Tamarack where they weren't supposed to have children.

[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.780]
And the thing that really frosted my butt was that the people next door to them had a pet, a monkey.

[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.500]
Mm-hmm.

[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:56.360]
So the bottom line is the monkey was okay, but the baby was like a threat to these people.

[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.180]
Get it out of here.

[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.600]
Get that thing out of here.

[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.440]
So maybe some of those old people are into like your rillers and stuff like that?

[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.960]
Well, that was a long time ago.

[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:05.680]
Couple of years.

[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.540]
Well, that thing is still going on.

[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.000]
I don't know what happened with them, but they were apoplectic.

[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.820]
Very humane attitudes in their part.

[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.540]
Oh, yeah, that's the one thing about the old Fartsman.

[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.340]
They're so humane, understanding, compassionate, and kind.

[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.240]
You hear them.

[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.180]
There were some who called it an unsteep show yesterday.

[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.700]
You should only drop dead, you bastard.

[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.120]
She was great.

[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.100]
I'm not exaggerating.

[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.100]
That's what she said.

[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.500]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.180]
She was terrific.

[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.660]
A real, gentile lady or gentile one of the other.

[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:33.820]
Wilten manners.

[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:34.220]
Hello.

[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.240]
Good morning, guys.

[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:35.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.740]
Evidently, you haven't heard about the new self-lord, a youth of the math?

[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.380]
It's more of an attitude.

[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:43.140]
Yeah.

[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.720]
What they're trying to do is get rid of all the college kids.

[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.380]
They already did that, pal.

[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.140]
They're long gone.

[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.260]
We're not working on holidays, but that's it.

[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.600]
Well, now they're working on the college kids or the high school kids and the grade school.

[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.040]
If you're under 18, we don't want you.

[00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.060]
That's for damn sure.

[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.200]
And these kids realize that.

[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.680]
I mean, they get the high school diplomas.

[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.740]
They're not even wet and they're out of this town.

[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.880]
They're not even wet.

[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.400]
Well, you mean they're diplomas, yes.

[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.380]
Yeah, they get.

[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.220]
I wasn't sure I knew what you were talking about.

[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:10.660]
I know.

[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.000]
Don't get these old people that don't have coronaries during the show.

[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.020]
I'm a sad one.

[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.120]
As far as the attorney yesterday, do you have one question?

[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.380]
Which is appropriate discrimination?

[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.520]
Whatever the hell he can make money doing, okay?

[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:23.580]
Supporting and defending.

[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.800]
That Alan Becker, man, and he listens to this show.

[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.280]
Alan, you're a Schmendrich, okay?

[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.020]
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.380]
Alan listens to the show.

[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.480]
Alan Becker, because I know him.

[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.860]
You know, I mean from long ago, I think he was on my show many more.

[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.280]
Alan Becker, you're a douchebag.

[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.040]
That is correct.

[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:43.740]
They douchebag among brain, a subhuman, a heartless cruel, cold, calculating money grabbing.

[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.480]
But other than that, he's a pretty good guy.

[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:45.820]
He's right.

[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:46.440]
Never stole a break from him.

[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.800]
He is not a bad guy, but it's just these attorneys.

[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.400]
You know, they see those dollar signs and they see these old people, man,

[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.920]
just like the doctors down here.

[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.600]
You know, it's like a game with a Medicare.

[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:56.100]
Yeah.

[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.280]
And they got him coming back every other day.

[00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.060]
What do you want, Sharon?

[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.920]
I'm just going to cut you out of Becker.

[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.520]
I was like a graduate, you're so good at this.

[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.040]
Oh, he did.

[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.100]
I didn't hear the end of the show.

[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.540]
Well, I don't listen.

[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.740]
Don't buy into that, okay?

[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.320]
He's still going to go back to his office.

[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.740]
And he's still going to grab all the money you can for, you know,

[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.260]
working for these condos.

[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.100]
Don't buy into that.

[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.240]
Don't be naive, Sharon.

[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.880]
This paid by day you have for Camilla Suss.

[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:18.720]
Is it a great idea?

[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.800]
Is there a senior citizen discount with the plan?

[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.440]
No, there isn't.

[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.200]
Senior citizen is 20% extra.

[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.360]
Okay, good deal.

[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.660]
Okay, you have a great day, pal.

[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.040]
You two guys.

[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:27.480]
Bye.

[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.400]
1029 at WIOD.

[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.900]
I can't believe you don't remember Bonnie Palmerance.

[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.360]
That was a long time ago I do.

[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.860]
And her husband Rocky, who used to be the police chief on the beach.

[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:37.980]
I know that's not her husband.

[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:38.860]
No, that's not.

[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.340]
It's a different Palmerance.

[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.900]
Yes, that is a different family.

[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.080]
I know that family.

[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:43.800]
Do you?

[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:44.580]
Yeah.

[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.720]
And their daughter, Vicki?

[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:47.540]
Oh, Vicki.

[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.260]
This is fun.

[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.800]
I bet the audience is really getting into this.

[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:50.520]
Anybody else?

[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.020]
No, she works for CBS.

[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.340]
How about her sister-in-law, Sadie?

[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:53.820]
Do you know her?

[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.820]
I think Vicki works on the Dan Rather show.

[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.580]
Last time I knew.

[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.340]
I'll be Dan.

[00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.060]
How about that?

[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.520]
What the hell does that have to do with a couple that got kicked out and hurt her?

[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.580]
I remember it, but very, very vaguely.

[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:04.560]

[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.500]
Foggy and vague.

[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:06.920]
Yeah, I do remember.

[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.180]
Okay, Delray.

[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:08.500]
Hello.

[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.140]
Hello.

[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:09.720]
Neil.

[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.220]
Yes.

[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.840]
This is the youngest person living in Delray in high school.

[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.000]
Hold on, is there 78?

[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.240]
No, I'm 21 and I'm stuck in high point in Delray.

[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.700]
They're one in high point.

[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.500]
Yeah, they're one of the associations that just passed that law.

[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.200]
But you have to be like 112 to buy a condo here.

[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.140]
So let me tell you if they are monitoring and listening to this call,

[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.960]
you could be out on the street by the weekend.

[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.720]
I think they're coming towards the house with guns,

[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.140]
so I'm going to go in the other room and hide.

[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.400]
But I was going there to make a request that you might be interested in.

[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.900]
I'm going to leave here around 7 o'clock tonight.

[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.400]
I was wondering if you could fly over high point and drop the A-bomb.

[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:42.920]
And I should take care of it.

[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.880]
No, no, we're just dropping a small neutron bomb that eliminate the people

[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.680]
and leave the building.

[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.420]
Well, that'll do it.

[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.560]
So that's my request for the day.

[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.080]
Take care.

[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:49.680]
Okay, sir.

[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:49.960]
Bye.

[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.740]
It sounded like they were coming to get him.

[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:52.820]
You notice how quick he got off?

[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:53.520]
Real quick.

[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.300]
Boy, he ran out of here like a bad out of hell.

[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.380]
Here's a leaf foul report from Jupiter,

[00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.940]
which is right next to Uranus.

[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:00.280]
Hello.

[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:01.840]
Hello, Neil.

[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:02.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.060]
I'm becoming a chronic, but I can't do anything about it.

[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:06.640]
Let's talk about it.

[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.840]
We need a chronic in Jupiter.

[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:08.360]
Huh?

[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.160]
I say we need a chronic in Jupiter.

[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.920]
Wow, I've called you from a...

[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.000]
Well, I'm a salesman.

[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.260]
I'm out on the road all the time.

[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.680]
I don't get to call when I'd like to, but often enough.

[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.700]
Listen, last night,

[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:24.280]
Fowler comes on and he plays this car and it starts out.

[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.140]
This is leaf foulard.

[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.600]
And then you hear the eggs crack.

[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.600]
Oh, no.

[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.120]
Oh, no.

[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:30.780]
Now wait a minute.

[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.500]
Now he's gone too far, okay?

[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.400]
Can you believe it?

[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.200]
Now the man has gone too far.

[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.420]
It's one thing when he rips off all your other material,

[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.500]
but when he's starting to do a little stick lock and rip those off,

[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.180]
that's too much.

[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.580]
And then you start that macadamia.

[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.500]
That was Capri's idea.

[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.960]
Yeah, he's the one that Don Zeta.

[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.020]
He's the one that put all those things.

[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.840]
I got a whole bunch of those in Spanish, in English, in Ukrainian.

[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.480]
I thought that was macadamia.

[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.160]
Almost.

[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:54.920]
Almost.

[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:55.540]
Pretty close.

[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.060]
Well, you know, there are some living and breathing people up here

[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.200]
and in Palm Beach.

[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.020]
Well, yeah, sure.

[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.760]
It's easy for you to say.

[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.460]
Maybe if you got a search party together, you could find 10, okay?

[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.140]
Well, not a thing, so.

[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.420]
But anyway, keep it up.

[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.820]
I mean, yeah, keep it up.

[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:13.640]
Yeah, keep it up.

[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.480]
Easy for you to say pal, okay, have a good one.

[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.020]
Okay, right.

[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.200]
Okay, so to speak, boy, all these people,

[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.100]
they're a little cute double on time this morning.

[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:20.780]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.160]
Getting ready for an exciting weekend, boy, they're dreaming.

[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:27.220]
We got a call on our line open rather in Palm Beach, 655,

[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.160]
WIOD.

[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.420]
Leaking call on that line.

[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.500]
And Le is calling next week, okay?

[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.380]
I thought he should defend himself.

[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.460]
Now, he needs the whole weekend to create some more BS so that he has a real good thing for it.

[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.960]
And not only that, Steve's not in the building.

[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.800]
Have you noticed this incestuous relationship that we can only speak to Le.

[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.180]
Yeah.

[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.240]
When Steve is the mediary.

[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.060]
Yes, exactly.

[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.200]
Middleman.

[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.780]
The middle, well, they have a word for that.

[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.800]
When Steve acts as the intermediary.

[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.200]
Uh-huh.

[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.460]
Okay, we got a Tom Jicca and Christmas card report from Boca.

[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:55.780]
Hello.

[00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:00.620]
Okay, first, that Christmas card thing you read yesterday about the kid with the Gittest Book of World Records.

[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:00.980]
Yeah.

[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:06.840]
It's a hoax story from the Associated Press Thursday saying that it's a hoax.

[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.500]
It started out with someone in England and it just got out of control.

[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.800]
And there's no substance to it.

[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.140]
Really?

[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:12.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.120]
I'll send in the article if you want to see it.

[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.400]
Okay, well, I won't read it again.

[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:16.920]
Okay.

[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.000]
But it did sound it was a real heart-rending thing, you know?

[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.180]
Well, that's the point.

[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.360]
And the other thing is Jicca's got a job.

[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:24.240]
I know that.

[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:24.800]
Oh, okay.

[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.000]
That's it, then.

[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.420]
Board of Auditor News, right?

[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:28.960]
That's right.

[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.260]
Bill Kelly is leaving.

[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:31.960]
Bill Kelly is leaving.

[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.900]
Which we told this on here, at least two weeks ago.

[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:34.440]
Yeah, sorry.

[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.580]
No, no, that's okay.

[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:36.800]
See, it kind of cancels out.

[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.560]
You had one, you know, then you contribute and the other one is terminal.

[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.700]
So it evens out.

[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:41.360]
Okay.

[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.780]
Like a big zero, you know what I'm saying?

[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.220]
I know what you're saying.

[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.360]
So you've gotten all this money for the Camille House from all these celebrities.

[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.240]
Have you gotten anything from Russell Waces yet?

[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.440]
Not yet, but we're waiting.

[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.100]
I'm sure Russell's going to come up with a big one.

[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.560]
I thought he would like send in $2,000 dollars.

[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.420]
Yeah, that's a good idea.

[00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:58.920]
And Don Cox, too.

[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.280]
$5,000 dollars.

[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:01.940]
That's it.

[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.440]
Excellent thinking, pal.

[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:03.940]
Thank you.

[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:04.260]
Thank you.

[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.040]
How do you do?

[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:05.800]
You too.

[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.420]
That would be great.

[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.060]
And then we'll scream about it, too.

[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:13.980]
If Russell or Don Cox will send in a check for the Camille House, we will not only announce it on here, we'll scream it.

[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:14.880]
We have to scream?

[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:15.180]
Yeah.

[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.580]
And we'll use that Western Pennsylvania dollar instead of dollars.

[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:19.880]
I'll do it.

[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:20.500]
Trust me.

[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:28.760]
Anyway, I'm unusual for me to scream on a show, but, um, but, uh, but, uh, yeah, we can make an exception.

[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.460]
Maybe just a little practice session, okay?

[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:33.360]
Okay.

[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.660]
All right, 1034.

[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.660]
Henry Barrow is going on vacation next week.

[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.700]
We hope Henry has a wonderful time, but not too good because we have to be here.

[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.100]
Yeah.

[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.900]
And he's got a little news update and we'll come back on 610 WIOD.

[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:44.580]
Good day.

[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.340]
Oh, good year.

[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.580]
Thank you very much.

[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.160]
This is the King.

[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.400]
I don't have a minute around much for a while, but I want y'all to know what up here in Rock and Roll Heaven.

[00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.680]
Although, thank you to the, the Christmas.

[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.300]
I'd like to give y'all a special Christmas message.

[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.780]
A message of peace.

[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.840]
Like, uh, how about a little piece of that high-go-omba?

[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:10.480]
Thank you.

[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.020]
I got a lot.

[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:13.800]
A lot of us scream.

[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.260]
Christmas is a time of hoot.

[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.440]
A time of joy.

[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:18.800]
A time of eleven.

[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.340]
And I sure would love to take slides that feature you got there.

[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:23.500]
Okay.

[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.260]
What would I?

[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.640]
More or more like.

[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:26.760]
Oh, yeah, Christmas.

[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.840]
The Christmas to me means family.

[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.720]
Family means friends.

[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.780]
The friends means getting together.

[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.680]
And getting together means eating.

[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.940]
I'll pass you that time to say which place.

[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:39.860]
Oh, flaky.

[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:40.680]
I got a lot more.

[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.940]
Now, just a little slater here right now.

[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.220]
You know, I may be a big star.

[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.140]
Maybe too big.

[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:48.920]
But ain't nobody so big.

[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.340]
You can't reach out a helping hand.

[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.020]
A helping hand.

[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.720]
Hand me a helping over the knife.

[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:56.560]
Dator's over there.

[00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:57.100]
What you believe?

[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:57.780]
Lucky.

[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:58.680]
Mega-am-mosh.

[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.640]
Now, like I was saying, ain't nobody so big.

[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.500]
He can't stoop to help a friend of neat over the holiday season.

[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.760]
Speaking of season, won't pass me that soul-sucker when you get the chance.

[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:10.180]
Flaky.

[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.180]
Yeah, just those screws of color.

[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:12.520]
That's right.

[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:12.880]
Flaky.

[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:13.200]
Flaky.

[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:13.620]
I got a lot more.

[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:14.940]
So, let's Christmas.

[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.020]
Why don't y'all take a tip from old A.O.S.

[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.980]
Now, I'll leave those steak tips right where they are.

[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:21.500]
You know what I mean?

[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.580]
You know, I appreciate it, Flaky.

[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.420]
I want you to remember, for all the power to guys, great big family.

[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.160]
You know God made men into his own image.

[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.680]
And look at the mirror.

[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.100]
I'd have to say, God must be a big, big son of a gun.

[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:34.700]
You know what I mean?

[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:35.960]
I like you dear.

[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.980]
But I especially want y'all to remember this one last thing.

[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.620]
When y'all is homeless Christmas, springing that popcorn up on the tree,

[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.840]
save a big, big bowl for the king.

[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:48.660]
Extra butter, no what I mean?

[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:49.760]
I like you dear.

[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:50.600]
I like you.

[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.280]
I like you.

[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:51.740]
I like you.

[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.380]
That's okay, y'all.

[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.560]
This is 1040-2011 at WIOD.

[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.820]
We have a wonderful call from South Beach on one.

[00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:58.140]
Hello.

[00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.560]
Yes, I am.

[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.160]
Hey, brother bird.

[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.120]
You know, I like to hear you laughing.

[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:04.760]
Yeah.

[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.640]
And the doctors told me I was in the hospital, a vegetable hospital.

[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.060]
And they cut off the wrong leg, see?

[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.320]
And they told me to wait and not to worry about to lay.

[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:14.320]
It's a laugh.

[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:14.900]
Huh?

[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:15.760]
Yeah, it's a laugh.

[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.460]
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.940]
They said, that's right.

[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.540]
It wasn't, it could have been worse, they could have cut off something else, okay?

[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.880]
They could, they messed that up too.

[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:23.980]
Yeah, they really, yeah.

[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.320]
And it wouldn't work for a while.

[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.480]
And so I'm saying, that's health for both of you.

[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.280]
And Neil, I enjoyed those good songs, things you have.

[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:31.920]
Well, that's great.

[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.280]
I have my little tape recorder right here every time you read it, play one.

[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.060]
I'm clicking.

[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:36.420]

[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:36.740]
Okay.

[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.700]
You just keep me going, take it, thank you, man.

[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.900]
Okay, well, Dr. Watts is going to straighten you out, pal.

[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:41.500]
Okay, you have it.

[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.500]
Oh, there he goes, man.

[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:43.380]
Wow.

[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.180]
Cut off the wrong leg.

[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:45.660]
Good.

[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:46.520]
No big deal.

[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:47.740]
He laughed.

[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:48.860]
Hey, little mistake.

[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.740]
You know, anyway, we have an open line in Palm Beach, 655WIOD.

[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.220]
Don't get me started on doctors, okay?

[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:54.540]
Yes.

[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:59.280]
Boy, lawyers are bad, but at least most of the time, they don't kill you.

[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.120]
Most of the time.

[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:00.800]
Most of the time.

[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.300]
But doctors, that's another story.

[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.240]
I mean, most of them, I would say about 80% of doctors haven't got any idea.

[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.840]
I mean, any idea.

[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.140]
What the hell is going on?

[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:10.440]
No.

[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.700]
All they know is that they got a revolving door.

[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.220]
They keep sticking their head out to make sure that there's somebody in every one of those little cubicles.

[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.640]
And that's basically what it's all about.

[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.140]
And they make sure you give them a check.

[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.920]
And they write a lot of those prescriptions, man, because those detail men come in.

[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.000]
Now they got detailed women.

[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.560]
Have you noticed that?

[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.200]
There are women.

[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:27.700]
Oh, yeah.

[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.800]
A attractive young ladies who come in and peddle those pills.

[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:35.300]
And of course, they have some extra things to offer the doctor, I guess, right?

[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:35.680]
I guess.

[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:40.000]
Yeah, some extra little goodies on the side to make sure that they write lots and lots of those prescriptions.

[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.900]
For good things, like Fel Dean.

[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:43.680]
Miami, hello.

[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.000]
Yeah, Neil, just to let you know two quick things.

[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.100]
First, I have my contribution to Camilla's house in the mail.

[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:50.660]
Thank you.

[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:51.900]
And I'll be looking forward to that tape.

[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.720]
The other thing I wanted to tell you is a true story.

[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.140]
I beat the horses for a few dollars and decided to celebrate it.

[00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.480]
My favorite watering hole I walked in.

[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.960]
And the reform guys at the end of the bar, and there was this one blue hair sitting in just a couple of stools down from where I was going to sit.

[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.120]
And she worked out a place in the joint.

[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.060]
But I, I guess that I've won a few dollars.

[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.340]
And I called Barry, the bartender, over.

[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.240]
I said, Barry, give everybody in the place a drink.

[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.720]
I mean, have one yourself.

[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.160]
And fill me a favor, even give this old, do me a bag of your drinks.

[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.420]
Barry comes over and he says, Bill, Bill, Bill, please.

[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.720]
He says, you know, I'm a Neil Rogers fan too, but you can't say that in here.

[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.340]
This is ladies and gentlemen.

[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.480]
I said, all right, give this old lady a drink.

[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.140]
So Barry said, okay, man, this fellow wants to buy a drink.

[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:34.760]
What would you like?

[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.300]
She said vinegar and water.

[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.800]
Yeah, you were right.

[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:39.420]
True story.

[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:39.740]
Yeah.

[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.980]
She probably was Alan Massing Gale's grandmother.

[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:42.580]
Probably.

[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.700]
Okay, sir.

[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:44.200]
Thank you.

[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:44.840]
Incredible.

[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.780]
As Lee Fowler would say, I don't want to keep stealing Lee's lines.

[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.100]
You know, that Lee Fowler, we got another Fowler report on seven.

[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:51.500]
Hello.

[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:52.220]
Hi.

[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.720]
Guess who he had on yesterday as a guest.

[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.060]
How many guesses do we get now?

[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.120]
Is it somebody that Steve had on in the last two weeks?

[00:27:59.260 --> 00:27:59.520]
Yeah.

[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.740]
It wasn't Nadine the space queen again.

[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:02.100]
Was it?

[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:02.460]
No.

[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:03.320]
Okay.

[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.440]
Wait, no, wait a minute.

[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.180]
Don't tell who?

[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.140]
Mr. X, the conservative, Mr. X.

[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:10.820]
Oh, no.

[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.660]
Yeah, put the microphone down on the table.

[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.040]
Yeah, I'm going to blow my brains out on the air today at high noon.

[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.940]
Oh, this time you got to be kidding me.

[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.480]
No, and you know what they were talking about?

[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.020]
Now we know why Mr. X is the way he is.

[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.720]
He rides a motorcycle without a helmet.

[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.740]
Yeah, that's what they were talking about.

[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.440]
And can't you gum at the same time?

[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.180]
That's it.

[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.020]
But I thought you loved and noticed that.

[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:35.040]
So you do understand that Mr. X and Lee Fowler are part of this male bondage team

[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.340]
that with Steve, you do understand that, don't you?

[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.360]
And they hang out together and everything's like they're all glued together with the hip.

[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:42.420]
Wow.

[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.020]
And yeah, I'm serious.

[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.160]
Of course, I don't know what they do beside that, but boy, there's something really bizarre going on there.

[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.400]
That'll make the old turkey go back.

[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.600]
Mr. X, you know, isn't this incredible to talk about these chronic guests?

[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.660]
The only thing worse than a chronic caller, because you can hang up on a chronic caller, is a chronic guest.

[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.460]
They make people who are compulsive, who just have to get that fix.

[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.240]
They're like bad Mexican food.

[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.500]
They just keep coming back.

[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.320]
That is correct.

[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.680]
Can I ask you to confirm a rumor for me?

[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:12.040]
I understand that Alice, of course, is going to Europe on vacation.

[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.620]
I don't know anything about Christmas.

[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.080]
I understand that when he took his dog into the party.

[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:16.640]
Oh, no, sir.

[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:18.820]
Be kind.

[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:19.520]
I am.

[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.000]
I'm trying.

[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.400]
No, you're going to say something terrible.

[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.520]
I just have a feeling in a pythomized stomach, an alvogate emotional again,

[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.380]
and his mother will call him on the phone in tears.

[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.220]
Don't do it, sir.

[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:28.560]
Please.

[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.500]
There's them right, huh?

[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.520]
He was taking his dog into the kennel yesterday to drop it off,

[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.540]
and he was walking in behind a man with a litter of dobermans.

[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.380]
To have their ears trimmed, I understand they grabbed down and took him in there.

[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.500]
Is that true?

[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.220]
To have his ears trimmed?

[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.520]
Well, you've seen those suckers.

[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.580]
No, he's got fairly large ears, but not like Dumbo.

[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.800]
Well, I heard the Disney's after him for the next movie.

[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.100]
Oh, you're cruel, sir.

[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.360]
You're nasty and cruel.

[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.460]
But it's kind of interesting.

[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.300]
And his mother is in tears now as we speak.

[00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.160]
Well, I'm sorry.

[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.820]
I'm a bad person.

[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.760]
You really are, but at least you admitted that's good.

[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:03.480]
That's a good start.

[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.640]
That's excellent beginning for therapy, Frons.

[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.300]
I'm going to go whip myself right now.

[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:07.600]
Okay.

[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:08.080]
Goodbye.

[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.860]
Bob, did he say he's going to go whip himself?

[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:10.400]
I can't.

[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.440]
He's the high-freaked TV news.

[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:17.600]
Bishop.

[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.960]
All right.

[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.420]
The high-pissed TV news.

[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.080]
He's anchored with a whip.

[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.200]
That's funny, Dave.

[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.340]
That impolving figure.

[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.060]
The high-tiny wall.

[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.960]
It must be anchored with a whip.

[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.600]
Now, we need a whip.

[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.420]
I do wear weapons below the dash.

[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.240]
Well, we need a whip.

[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.800]
Anchor with a whip.

[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:10.180]
We have a high-freakedness to walk away from us all.

[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.620]
I'm a bad person.

[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.480]
Anchor with a whip.

[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.220]
We need a whip.

[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.900]
I do wear weapons below the dash.

[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:25.820]
Oh!

[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.660]
Now, from the 10th, I was in the...

[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.140]
I guess that's a Q and a base.

[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.360]
Where's that going?

[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.260]
What, what's he doing with that machine gun?

[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:37.800]
Oh my gosh, quick, quick.

[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:38.540]
We're going to...

[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:42.860]
He was bad up with reading one story after another

[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.520]
about drugs and violence.

[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:49.400]
Now, she wants to write the route and rewrite the news

[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.560]
in and full.

[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.260]
Starring and Vichel!

[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.940]
Don't kill me please!

[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.600]
I'll see you tonight at 5.611.

[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:00.400]
Scott!

[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.220]
And oh!

[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.960]
She took the news into her own hands!

[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.020]
What are you guys going to do with me?

[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.100]
When I get through with you,

[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.940]
there won't be enough of you left to make a good suitcase for Don Noll.

[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.700]
And oh!

[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.240]
Starring and Vichel!

[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.580]
Also starring Carl Weathers is Dwight Lutterdale.

[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:23.860]
And Don Not That Don Noll!

[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.240]
There's a stationary car over the Midwest!

[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:27.980]
And both!

[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.320]
He three wrote the news!

[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.820]
And Paul coming soon!

[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.800]
Okay, I had to play those two back-to-back

[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.240]
because it just fits so well, right?

[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:37.700]
Mm-hmm.

[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.840]
That is in another follow-up, or we did that.

[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:40.820]
Okay, boy, panic.

[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:41.480]
Thank God.

[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.840]
Because I think we could have his whole audience called him

[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.520]
by the end of the show.

[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.980]
We've already had two or three.

[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.820]
And we get another three or four calls.

[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.540]
That could be it.

[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.140]
Okay, Lee, it's just a joke, Lee.

[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:52.780]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.480]
As Lee, what's his name would say?

[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:55.560]
How soon they forget?

[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.120]
Oh, Jay Michaels would say.

[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.120]
It's just a joke.

[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.020]
That's it.

[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.020]
And every time he said it, he was talking about that show.

[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.260]
How come we haven't heard from Dr. Vots yet, boy?

[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.640]
That'll make my weak if-

[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.900]
Did Paul yesterday or was that-

[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.200]
That wasn't the real Dr. Vots?

[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.180]
What's the Dr. Vots Jr?

[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.420]
Yeah, that was Vots Jr.

[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:13.680]
Fort Lutterdale.

[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:13.960]
Hello.

[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.160]
Good morning, now.

[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:15.660]
Yes, sir.

[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.660]
And good morning to you, too.

[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:18.620]
But-

[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.220]
Okay, be careful now.

[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.840]
That was kind of like an afterthought, I know.

[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.340]
Yeah, well, I like New York.

[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.520]
I'm a first time crowd by the way, Neil.

[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.000]
Great.

[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.460]
And I started listening to your show, by the way.

[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.160]
That in 40 cents will get your real water recovery cup of coffee.

[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.960]
Well, by accident, I started listening to your show.

[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.480]
I turned in on my clock radio.

[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.600]
My alarm radio to the AMD off in the amp's

[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.240]
had been brought out for me times this year.

[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.580]
And it started going off and going to your show

[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.600]
to wake me up in the morning.

[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:43.400]
I woke late at night.

[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.300]
And I find you'd be very intelligent and quick,

[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.580]
but I can't say the same about your co-host, your Burke.

[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.400]
Reminds me of like a watered down,

[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.560]
dropped a version of Ed McMahon.

[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.360]
But, at any point, I was...

[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.680]
You hang up on this guy.

[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.280]
No, no, no.

[00:33:58.780 --> 00:33:59.820]
I'm just gonna show it up there, though.

[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.420]
I'm hoping no one can get hanged up on.

[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.980]
The only thing he's trying to be creative.

[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.860]
Come on, he didn't just say you were a jerk or something.

[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:05.520]
He's creative.

[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.800]
He's getting testy, sir, he's getting hostile.

[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.820]
He's slow, I don't know.

[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:10.920]
He seems to need me to be like, like, not on there sometimes.

[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:11.860]
Well, that is true.

[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.820]
He's not all here sometimes.

[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.200]
Sometimes he's fantasizing about being someplace else.

[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.120]
I think Neil can do better.

[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.900]
Like at this moment, like any place else.

[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:18.040]

[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.280]
But anyway, how about that?

[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.300]
So about Anne Talker.

[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.860]
Uh, this is about what?

[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:22.560]
Anne Talker.

[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:23.280]
Yeah.

[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:23.740]
Good.

[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.820]
I'm gonna talk all over you.

[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.200]
Go ahead.

[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.220]
It seems to me that I'm going to be able to bother you.

[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:29.540]
I'm going to be able to bother you.

[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:30.180]
Every child, too, no?

[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.180]
Just to bug you.

[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.620]
It sounds like the radiation is set.

[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:33.260]
It's set, you know.

[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:35.080]
And more time knock on each other's radiance.

[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.200]
That's right, that's because that's what the audience wants.

[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.540]
We have a bunch of sadist here, sir.

[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.820]
This is a big SNM town.

[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.800]
I think you deserve your customer.

[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.940]
Our customers deserve that.

[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:45.100]

[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.920]
I think you can't be giving them.

[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.820]
Well, let me say this to you, sir.

[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.080]
I hope your second call is a lot more constructive and better than this one.

[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:52.340]
Okay.

[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.560]
This is first call ever.

[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.360]
He's ripping you and he's critiquing the show.

[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.120]
We don't need any more program directly.

[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.720]
So, we've already got one and he's brain dead.

[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.200]
So just cut the crap.

[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.420]
Neil would have to dump.

[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:03.360]
Really?

[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:04.640]
That hospital.

[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:05.580]
He upset me.

[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.460]
It was so unnecessary.

[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:07.860]
What a way to.

[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:08.540]
It's okay.

[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:12.360]
We have an open line in Boka at 278-9463.

[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.340]
That's 278-W-I-O-D.

[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.040]
Sure.

[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:15.820]
And we'll come back.

[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.600]
Right after this.

[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:18.200]
Right after this.

[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.140]
This is real vibrates.

[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:22.620]
Topic men.

[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:27.200]
Ladies and gentlemen, we have in our hands right now something so shocking.

[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:28.180]
What a day.

[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:29.060]
Is this incredible?

[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.200]
Now this is going to make up.

[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:30.720]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.980]
Let's talk to Dr. Vots.

[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.040]
Uh huh.

[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.720]
It is Dr. Vots.

[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.340]
Vots going on.

[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.800]
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the man who singlehandedly destroyed the J-Michael show.

[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:46.420]
Although he didn't need a lot of help, but this man put him right over the top.

[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.740]
Hell, men, the J-Michael, we're going to.

[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:51.520]
Okay, good call.

[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:52.640]
Now listen.

[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:58.900]
Listen, we have, and I want to thank Stephen in Miami who evidently has the original.

[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.960]
So he can make all the copies we want, okay?

[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.640]
We have.

[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.240]
This is, you talk about mail coming in this place.

[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.640]
We will send to you is our very own Christmas gift.

[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.040]
It's probably going to be late because it's already the 16th.

[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.100]
But all you got to do is send us.

[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.200]
We'll even let them spring for the envelopes here.

[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.240]
Okay, they got more money than God in this damn place.

[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.300]
Just send us a request to postcard or letter.

[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.800]
And we will send you as a holiday gift from WIOD.

[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:28.420]
You're very own.

[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.320]
Boom in the box.

[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:32.420]
Look at this.

[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.100]
Is this incredible or what?

[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.640]
He talked about the old days.

[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:38.200]
Now this is a picture of a young Pat Boone.

[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.280]
This is what he was in college.

[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.000]
The college of musical knowledge or something like that.

[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:48.320]
And he has a cardboard, small cardboard box through which he is sticking.

[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:51.380]
Well, you'll have to see it for yourself.

[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:51.660]
Yeah.

[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.040]
Unbelievable.

[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.500]
This is from Hustler magazine, okay?

[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:56.600]
So it's a kosher.

[00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.400]
You know, I mean, anybody who wants it certainly is entitled to it because it's already,

[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.160]
it's out there.

[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.980]
Is this incredible?

[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.560]
I never thought we would see the old Boone in the box again.

[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.580]
No, I will suggest to you, those of you who don't have real good vision,

[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.280]
probably need one of those magnifying things you buy in the drugstore.

[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.740]
You know, one of those reading, you know what I'm talking about.

[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:19.540]
The Mel, Talimar, Talimar, Talimar, Talisco, Jr.

[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:22.680]
You'll have to have to see exactly what it is.

[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.980]
I mean, what you see, I guess, is what you get.

[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:25.880]
It'll make it.

[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.960]
Or what Shirley Foley gets or something like that.

[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.900]
It'll give you a chuckle for the holidays, okay?

[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:32.840]
So just send all your requests.

[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:33.980]
This is serious now.

[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.160]
This is going to be, it will set you free.

[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:42.560]
And when you look at this and you think of Pat, you know, on TV doing his pseudo-religious

[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.220]
Goodie Tushus, all of that other crap, you know.

[00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:46.960]
I am not a thief or whatever.

[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:47.940]
It'll make you think.

[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.120]
Yeah, it'll make you really think.

[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.340]
It'll make you ponder.

[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.160]
The situation is Casey would say.

[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:54.460]
It'll be so ponderous that you'll just fall on the floor and laugh.

[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:55.800]
You'll think of Debbie too.

[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:56.960]
Debbie Boone, yeah.

[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.060]
You light up my life.

[00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.360]
If she'll be singing, as you look at the old Boone in the box.

[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.540]
And the expression on his face is what always got me.

[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:07.640]
Look at as if, oh, look what I found, you know, it's not much, but it's the best I can

[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:07.800]
do.

[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:09.700]
Holy Toledo Pat.

[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.620]
So anyway, what a day.

[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:15.580]
If you'd like one, just send us your name and address on a card or a letter and send

[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:17.000]
it to Boone in the box.

[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:20.260]
And we won't even ask, I could do another Camille-Saus thing on this, but this is too

[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:21.120]
important, okay?

[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:26.240]
Because we want people, even Schleppers, who can't afford to send donation to have

[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.120]
these two for their own personal collection.

[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.620]
This could be worth a lot of dose someday.

[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:35.540]
And just send to Boone in the box, Karen E. O'Rodgers, W-I-O-D, Miami 33141.

[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.380]
Have you guys ever seen this before?

[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:39.020]
Trust me.

[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:39.440]
Trust me from in there.

[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.560]
I'll actually give you one if Nick will make the effort.

[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.620]
He's not going to get up out of the chair.

[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:43.380]
You've got to see this.

[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:43.880]
Trust me.

[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:44.780]
It's worth getting that work.

[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:45.580]
He's not going to get up.

[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:45.900]
Okay.

[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.200]
Okay.

[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.240]
He's afraid to look.

[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.400]
Believe me, it's nothing you haven't seen before, okay?

[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.360]
Nothing to be afraid of.

[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.780]
It's pretty hysterical.

[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:59.900]
Anyway, that's Boone in the box, Karen E. O'Rodgers, W-I-O-D, Miami 33141.

[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:03.140]
Another reason I'm happy to do this is I want to have so much mail coming in here that

[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.860]
they get a herni out front just having to lift the boxes.

[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.380]
Yeah, we got out to the dean.

[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.400]
Now, this is a great call.

[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.720]
Here's somebody who's an April Whirtham Lips fan.

[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.280]
Yeah, remember a couple weeks ago you guys were talking about USA Today and they had,

[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.140]
I guess they had some contest and picked the best lips.

[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.100]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.440]
I had the luxury of seeing April Whirtham once and I think she has the most luscious lips.

[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.260]
Oh, you mean hot lips?

[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:22.920]
Whirtham, yeah.

[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.280]
Yeah.

[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:27.620]
Her voice just gets, I think every man in South Florida going in her lips.

[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:28.800]
Really?

[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.440]
I think she should have been number one in the USA Today list.

[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.220]
It's pretty obvious.

[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.580]
Didn't take much for you, pal, right?

[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:34.900]
Well, yeah, I mean, you've seen her.

[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:35.820]
You tell the people.

[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.260]
She's gorgeous.

[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.020]
She really is.

[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.160]
She's a very attractive, super wonderful lady.

[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:39.700]
That's true.

[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:40.700]
And she's got that voice.

[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.980]
She should be on some of those phone lines, those fantasy lines.

[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:46.560]
Okay, well listen, her and Arlene Ross over to your house right now to fill in, okay?

[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:47.000]
No, no, no.

[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.240]
We've seen Arlene.

[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:48.700]
Okay.

[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.680]
Like I said, if you find Mount Rushmore in your living room, you'll understand.

[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.140]
Hey, Doc, one thing.

[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.340]
That was cute.

[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.060]
That was excellent.

[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.300]
Okay, we have an open line in Broward where we just hung up or in date.

[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:00.760]
I'm sorry.

[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.560]
7519463 751 WIOD.

[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:09.260]
Don't forget now, boom in the box WIOD Miami 33141.

[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.580]
It'll be one of the most astonishing, I guess, is the word we're looking for.

[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.940]
Okay, hot lips, Barrow is standing by with the 11 o'clock news and we'll come back with

[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.440]
our number two at 1105.

[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.400]
Okay?

[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:30.400]

[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.560]
Or 655 and 278 WIOD in the Palm Beach.

[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.220]
Other areas may call caulac.

[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.840]
The opinions expressed by the host guest or collars are not necessarily those of the

[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.200]
station.

[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:55.300]
Now, here's Neil Rogers on NewSort Radio 610 WIOD.

[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:11.540]
The 1107 WIOD Fernando Beniz of Universal National Bank is offering three branches as drop-off

[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:15.240]
locations for things for CamillaSaus clothing and food and stuff like that.

[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:17.120]
Are you following me?

[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.120]
I'm sorry you're eating.

[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:18.840]
Excuse me.

[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.600]
I'm listening to every word.

[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:27.360]
Universal National Bank, they're at 177th and BisGain, 125th Street east of BisGain and

[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.700]
117 North East, first avenue in downtown Miami.

[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.120]
So if you've got any goodies that you want to drop off and you're in those areas, Universal

[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:39.600]
National Bank has agreed to pick them up and deliver them and we appreciate that.

[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:43.140]
I mean, be collecting places and deliver them over to CamillaSaus.

[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:48.360]
Okay, we've got a couple of Palm Beach lines open in Bokka 278 WIOD.

[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:48.860]
What do I say?

[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.800]
We've got a couple open.

[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:52.940]
That's all we've got is a couple and 655 WIOD.

[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:53.780]
They're always open.

[00:43:53.880 --> 00:44:00.360]
And we want to thank our friends at Rick's Esendelli for the Motsubal soup and the stuff

[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:03.240]
cabbage which you are eating and I'm looking at but I'm not touching.

[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:04.660]
And what else is in there?

[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.960]
There's some all kinds of good stuff.

[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.040]
Find out as we go through.

[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.100]
Yeah, as you go through.

[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:08.980]
As I go through.

[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.060]
Okay, moving right along, let's go to Miramar.

[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:12.420]
Hello.

[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.020]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:14.560]
Okay.

[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:19.660]
I think what you're doing for the CamillaSaus is great and it should help a lot of people.

[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.700]
I sent my checkout last week.

[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.200]
I got a favor to ask.

[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:27.480]
A suggestion?

[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.300]
Do I sound like I'm begging?

[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:30.760]
Yeah.

[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.080]
It sounded like you're dehumanizing us.

[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.780]
Oh, one more thing before I came.

[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:35.940]
I was listening to this.

[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.600]
I do a little more tinkling than we might.

[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.480]
Okay, listen.

[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.640]
I was just pretty obvious the game plan of this call, you know what I mean?

[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:46.340]
No, I just wanted to tell you, I think, anyway, I called Zeta.

[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:47.260]
All right.

[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:48.960]
Zeta?

[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:49.960]
Oh, yeah, I remember them.

[00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:54.440]
No, because there's nobody listening to like from 8 to 10 when I'm driving to work.

[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.160]
And how many people are like on that show now?

[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:00.660]
47.

[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:02.760]
You can't understand.

[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.740]
I hear Dave every once in a while, you know?

[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.980]
But there's like 10 people and I don't know what the hell they're talking about it ever.

[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.760]
Well, each one of them is going to get a tenth of the point in the next book.

[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:14.840]
So you add that up and it's going to be exciting.

[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:15.260]
Okay.

[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.780]
Now, here's where I need to explain.

[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:18.760]
Why don't we get to it?

[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:19.500]
What do you really want?

[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:19.880]
Okay.

[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.240]
Let's cut out all the preliminaries and get right right down to it.

[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.020]
I want something.

[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.620]
You're demanding it.

[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.920]
No, I'm putting on a good song and a dance for us.

[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.460]
I am flying and you're not going to like this.

[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.960]
I'm flying to Newark, New Jersey.

[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.600]
No, you're the one who ain't going to like it.

[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:33.960]
I'm here.

[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.180]
I know I'm not going to like it.

[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:35.860]
You know, you're mine.

[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:37.500]
Yeah, I'm out of my mind.

[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.720]
But what I'm asking you.

[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:39.520]
I'm begging you.

[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.500]
I'm pleading with you.

[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:45.860]
Is that I have a tape of most of your plays you play.

[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:46.300]
Yeah.

[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:51.340]
The one I'm missing and I got a cousin who walks around talking to himself.

[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.260]
Oh, brother, this guy's going to Newark.

[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:56.000]
He's got a cousin who talks to himself.

[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.400]
He's got more problems and Carter's got pills.

[00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.020]
Yeah.

[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:02.000]
But what I need and I wish you would do it for me.

[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:03.240]
It would better be nice to us, sir.

[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.940]
We'll have him visit with you in his shape.

[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:05.460]
Okay.

[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:06.460]
What do you want?

[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.180]
I don't have it here.

[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.540]
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:15.320]
I don't have it here.

[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:15.900]
It's on CD.

[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:16.580]
It's in my heart.

[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:18.340]
Would you like me to go home and get it?

[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.120]
Can you call me out?

[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.660]
It only takes about 40 minutes each.

[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:21.360]
What?

[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:23.100]
Can you call me out?

[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:23.380]
Yeah, I'm calling.

[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:23.720]
I'm calling.

[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:23.880]

[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.220]
Hey, get out of bed and go find all this.

[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:27.680]
Is everyone playing on the phone?

[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:27.980]
God.

[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.120]
Okay, buddy.

[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:30.740]
Hey, I'm going to go home and get it.

[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.140]
Michael Jackson is the poor booth trying to get changed.

[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:34.820]
No.

[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.260]
No, that's an ACN thing.

[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:36.440]
All right.

[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:36.440]

[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:36.440]

[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.840]
You're out of tune but have a wonderful life pal.

[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.700]
Boy, talk about a constructive call.

[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:42.340]
That was excellent.

[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:43.580]
That was super.

[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:46.880]
Okay, we have an open line in Broward where that mongrain just disappeared.

[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:48.720]
524, WIOD.

[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:49.340]
We're watching you.

[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.980]
In 1116 at WIOD, we got a mobile in Del Ray.

[00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:55.040]
Boy, that line 7 today has been really active.

[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:55.460]
You know what?

[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:56.680]
Excuse me.

[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.440]
I realize you're on your fourth course now.

[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:00.360]
What the hell are you doing, man?

[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:05.780]
This guy's eating stuffed cabbage and conishes and very quietly just sucking up tons of food over here.

[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:06.820]
I didn't think you had tons.

[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:08.400]
No, I can't notice.

[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:10.140]
What were we doing?

[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.040]
A mobile in Del Ray.

[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:11.420]
Hello.

[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:12.740]
Mobile.

[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:13.340]
Are they gone?

[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.660]
Yeah, a bunch of cheap douchebags in Del Ray.

[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:17.700]
Like I told you, that line is dead as a dornium.

[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.380]
Okay, we got an open line in date.

[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:21.560]
751, WIOD, Miami.

[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.000]
Hello.

[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:22.720]
Hello.

[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:23.380]
Yes, sir.

[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.120]
Am I in the air?

[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.860]
It sure sounds like it to me.

[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:27.640]
All right.

[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:28.260]
Well, listen.

[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.040]
Two things.

[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.680]
I listened to a song on your radio about three weeks ago.

[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.700]
And it was one of the funniest songs I've ever heard.

[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.080]
It had to do with candy bars.

[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.460]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.020]
What's the name of that song?

[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:41.200]
Candy Rapper.

[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.100]
Candy Rapper.

[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:42.360]
Yeah.

[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:43.640]
Who's the artist?

[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:44.720]
Sticky fingers.

[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.200]
Candy Rapper, that figure.

[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:46.700]
Okay.

[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:51.940]
I was driving to work today and I saw billboard on top of the highway.

[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.300]
144th Street.

[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.180]
It went up about three weeks ago.

[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:56.240]
It has your name on it.

[00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:00.060]
It's from Zeta 4 and it's advertising you for that radio station.

[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.960]
What do you mean it went up about three weeks ago?

[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:02.640]
They're not putting...

[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.500]
They can't be putting new ones up for them.

[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:08.360]
You know, I live in the area and I go that way every day to work and...

[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.240]
Telling you it's up there and advertising you for...

[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.080]
Well, we haven't been there for seven weeks now.

[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:13.880]
How is that possible?

[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:14.240]
Pardon me?

[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.060]
We haven't been there for seven weeks.

[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.140]
Well, check it out.

[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:18.540]
144th Street in St.

[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:18.760]
St.

[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.740]
One last thing.

[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.780]
I got a message from my lovely wife.

[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:25.160]
She was a double douchebag last night.

[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:26.380]
Neil, thanks a lot.

[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:26.620]
Hey.

[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:26.880]
Okay.

[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:27.980]
You played that song for me.

[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:29.560]
I'd appreciate it.

[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:30.100]
Okay.

[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:31.480]
Good luck to you, sir.

[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.100]
Sounded almost like a request.

[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:33.400]
Yeah.

[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.120]
Let me make it very clear again.

[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:35.380]
Okay.

[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.880]
Because this requesting is really ponderous.

[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.400]
I mean so ponderous.

[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.000]
And not only that, the audience doesn't want to hear that.

[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.120]
It's not an interesting call.

[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.800]
I mean, we don't expect the calls to be interesting, but at least marginal borderline.

[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:47.780]
Okay.

[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.160]
But that's just...

[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.320]
It's like terminal.

[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:54.480]
It's like listening to that Mark Denver on Waxy FM.

[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:55.360]
That bad?

[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:56.620]
Well, pretty close.

[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:56.980]
Yeah.

[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:58.320]
When he does that music for lovers.

[00:48:58.720 --> 00:48:59.400]
Oh, God.

[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:03.720]
When he sounds like he's doing some voyeuristic grotesque thing on the air, whatever it is.

[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:05.360]
I just am not into that.

[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:06.680]
It's boring.

[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.300]
Oh, and telling my love him very, very much.

[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:11.340]
Oh, give.

[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:13.120]
Play it a damn record already.

[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:13.660]
Okay.

[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:15.100]
We don't want to hear that.

[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:17.680]
And it's the same with this.

[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:20.220]
Like I said, we'll play it when we get around to it.

[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:21.340]
Because you know what they say.

[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.240]
What goes around.

[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.260]
I am so excited about the boy.

[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:27.100]
That rich is going to have to come in here every day.

[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.040]
You know that because somebody is going to have to handle this.

[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:32.280]
Or unless of course you wanted to deal with it.

[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:33.540]
No, thanks.

[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:33.960]
You're sure?

[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.040]
I had my time.

[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.440]
It would be just like all times again.

[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:37.660]
Well, that's all pass.

[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.260]
Are you positive?

[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.040]
Yes, I am.

[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:41.480]
Okay.

[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.520]
You'll be sorry.

[00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:43.520]
I will.

[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:48.120]
Well, listen, sending these out gives you a certain sense of accomplishment of having done

[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.480]
something tremendous for mankind.

[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.260]
Well, I've already sent out thousands of them.

[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.020]
Of course, these were in those sillier college days.

[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:55.900]
You know, you know, everybody is going to go to college.

[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:56.940]
They get a little like Alan.

[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.660]
Okay, let's go to a mobile and Palm Beach.

[00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:02.080]
Hello.

[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:04.200]
Hello.

[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:05.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.180]
We're the douchebags that have up on you.

[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:08.420]
You're what?

[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.700]
We were the douchebags that have up on you.

[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:11.480]
Well, I can see why.

[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:16.020]
This line sounds like you're calling from Jupiter or Uranus.

[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:17.820]
What is Bob?

[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:19.100]
What is Century Village?

[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.080]
Well, that explains it.

[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:22.760]
What a call.

[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.180]
Okay, I'm returning to hang up on him.

[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.600]
When you get a car phone that works, or call us back.

[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.560]
Okay, don't expect me to put that crap on a year.

[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:29.900]
All right.

[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:31.300]
That sounds like garbage.

[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.320]
Get a phone that works.

[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.740]
You must have one of those you got at the camearts.

[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.260]
One of those car phones for about $7.95.

[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:43.020]
Sounded that you have to put together and operates on two AA batteries.

[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:44.800]
Sunrise.

[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:45.180]
Hello.

[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:46.080]
Yeah, hi.

[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:46.480]
Yeah.

[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:52.740]
Listen, I can sympathize with that other guy who called in earlier from the PA who had his light taken off and mistakenly.

[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:53.260]
Yeah.

[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.280]
Had another friend who had the wrong light taken off at the VA.

[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.520]
Well, you ought to get him together.

[00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:58.160]
Really?

[00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.260]
Well, and what happened?

[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.580]
Of course they had to do the right light anyway.

[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:03.960]
And you know, he consumed the VA?

[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:04.840]
Really.

[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:06.280]
You'd have a light to stand on.

[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:07.480]
Oh, that's cute.

[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.240]
I want to agree with that other guy.

[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.780]
I'm probably taking the vacation dinner.

[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:12.140]
What do you do?

[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.180]
Are you the new guy that replaced Ron Hershey's shirt?

[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.480]
You write material for sunny fox?

[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:16.480]
No.

[00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.640]
We don't even know these other stations.

[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:18.980]
Okay.

[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.380]
That other guy with the candy wrapper.

[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:21.660]
Yeah.

[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.200]
I'm home on vacation.

[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.700]
I got my recorded two dots.

[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:26.840]
So if you can get it in the background.

[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:28.480]
I have an even better idea for you.

[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.760]
I have an even better idea.

[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:35.760]
Why not send me a $20 check for CamiloSaus and you can have your own cassette with all kinds of stuff on it, including that?

[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.940]
Well, I have donated the Camilo.

[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:38.340]
Yeah.

[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.220]
Well, why not do it again?

[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:39.780]
Okay.

[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:40.400]
Okay.

[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:41.000]
Thank you.

[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:41.880]
I see.

[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:42.940]
Doesn't that solve the problem?

[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.580]
Shut him up.

[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:45.080]
Yeah.

[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:46.080]
Real quick.

[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:49.020]
Oh, I think I'm going to hold back on some of that stuff for a while.

[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:49.480]
Uh-huh.

[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.640]
Until this tape thing, that would be a great idea, wouldn't it?

[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:52.820]
Yeah.

[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:57.440]
Because that would be an extra incentive for a lot of these people to come up with that $20 bucks.

[00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:02.620]
You know, you see, when you get it for free, why should you donate $20 bucks to people who are out on the street starving?

[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:03.120]
That's right.

[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:10.680]
You know, in the news, every night on local TV within the first five minutes on every channel, there is another story about the plight of the homeless.

[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:11.120]
Okay.

[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.440]
And it's a serious problem all over the country.

[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:18.920]
And in this community, we've got lots and lots of people out there living on the streets eating out a garbage.

[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.720]
Big story these days.

[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:21.940]
Major stirrup.

[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:28.000]
So if you want that record and a whole bunch of the other stuff, the I-95 record, a whole slew of stuff, 45 minutes worth.

[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:32.740]
Just send us a 90 minute cassette with a check for $20 or more made out to Camilo's house.

[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.640]
And the stamp cell for our envelope we would appreciate.

[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:37.200]
And we'll send it to you.

[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:38.720]
How do you like that?

[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:39.460]
You like that?

[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:40.020]
Excellent.

[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.280]
And you did say 20 or something.

[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.140]
Instead of calling in with these chronic requests.

[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:46.040]
And you notice how they like to sneak it at air, be which way, man?

[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:49.720]
I am getting so, it is so ponderous, I'm ready to puke.

[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.640]
See, at first I like the creativity, the way they did it different way.

[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:53.860]
Yeah.

[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.280]
And now it's getting real, it's like a rip off.

[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.400]
It's kind of like leaf foulard.

[00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:03.840]
So anyway, I'm mail it to Camilo's house, care of Neil Rogers, WIO D Miami 33141.

[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.040]
That's WIO D Miami 33141.

[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:09.120]
It's 22 past 11.

[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.260]
And our good friends over at Toyota of Hollywood.

[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.100]
Toyota of holiday, that would be pretty cute.

[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:17.220]
I would like to brighten up your holiday.

[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:18.940]
Well, I'm having troubles today.

[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.780]
I don't know what it is, must go because it's Friday.

[00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:27.600]
But anyway, they'd like to brighten up with an incredible deal on one of those exciting flashy, sporty, new Suble UIO D.

[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:30.360]
This is the most disgusting program.

[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.880]
I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.820]
24 past 11 at WIO D.

[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:37.540]
Steve with open phones this afternoon.

[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:38.600]
Sports talk.

[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.680]
I think Hank is on tonight, if my memory is correct.

[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:41.640]
On Friday's.

[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.500]
Yeah, I think so.

[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:47.220]
And of course, the dolphins are going to wrap out an incredible season with another big win this weekend.

[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:49.340]
It's not the last game, is it?

[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.640]
Yeah, is it really for them?

[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:51.120]
For them, boy.

[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:53.080]
Not for everybody, but for us, trust me.

[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:56.140]
If you wait long enough to really play in this weekend.

[00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:58.120]
Um, Piper high.

[00:53:58.560 --> 00:53:59.680]
Well, good luck to them.

[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:01.400]
And they're 2.00 underdogs, by the way.

[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:02.440]
Well, that's the luck.

[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.980]
Speaking of Piper high, you know, CBS.

[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:04.860]
Really.

[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:09.100]
I started on the news last night, but you know, because we talked about it yesterday briefly.

[00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:10.500]
And it's not a big thing.

[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:13.600]
And by the way, those kids at KPX, they have terminals.

[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:14.820]
Yes, they do.

[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:15.860]
Just like you see that.

[00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:16.580]
Yes, I did.

[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:19.860]
Just say all these simply faced little kids who want to get into broadcasting.

[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:21.380]
Okay, forget it.

[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:22.380]
Don't you understand?

[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.660]
I've been telling you for a long time.

[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:25.240]
Go do an honest job somewhere.

[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:30.860]
Go get into some field of endeavor where you don't have to become totally frustrated and dehumanized and tortured.

[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:34.880]
And wind up out on the street with no job for two, three years at a time.

[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:35.520]
Forget it.

[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.300]
This is this is the worst.

[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:37.980]
Yeah.

[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:40.840]
In fact, go rent one of those little subrette hot dog carts.

[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.380]
Okay, much better business, much more profitable.

[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:44.920]
And you can be your own boss.

[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:45.500]
Okay.

[00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:49.300]
And if you have a nasty customer, you pull out one of the hot dogs and say, stick it.

[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:49.720]
Mm-hmm.

[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:50.640]
Where the moon don't shine.

[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:51.280]
Okay.

[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:52.560]
But not this.

[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:55.440]
But anyway, they got those pimply faced kids over at KPX.

[00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:00.740]
And I was going to start to disagree with CBS because Channel 6 up by me, they're in plantation.

[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:03.800]
You can't, it comes in so bad even on the cable.

[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:05.020]
It's a joke.

[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:09.380]
Oh, it's got all these specs and lines and dots and popping and puking.

[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:11.220]
It's horrendous.

[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:14.280]
I keep telling you, you are going to watch CBS from Palm Beach.

[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:18.500]
And so the bottom line I'm trying to make is that you're there trying to jump all over KPX.

[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:24.240]
There have been no complaints from anybody to the FCC that it's interfering with Channel 6's signal.

[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.200]
But now they're trying to get them off the air.

[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:30.980]
But as I think about it, you know, as it sinks in, if they don't give it to some of those pimply faced kids,

[00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:33.620]
I'm going to join CBS and do everything I can.

[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:39.780]
Now, didn't you hear in the story just a joke by the way that CBS made an offer to Piper, a compromise,

[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:40.880]
or really turned it down?

[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:41.820]
That would have passed the day in the air.

[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:45.260]
Yeah, but they were going to send him a couple of cases of acne stat and that's not going to do it.

[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.620]
I thought it was a great idea.

[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:49.120]
See, acne stat and you know who used to pedal that?

[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:49.680]
No.

[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:50.980]
You remember the scandal about that?

[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:51.440]
No.

[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.720]
It was Pat and his daughter Debbie.

[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:54.960]
Yikes, it was.

[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:58.900]
And the bottom line was they never had a pimple even on their butt.

[00:55:58.900 --> 00:55:59.460]
That's right.

[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:05.520]
That whole family has got skin like a baby and judging other things like a baby too from this balloon in the box picture.

[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:10.620]
And so they made him stop it because they were giving phony endorsement.

[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:11.080]
That's right.

[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:12.320]
I remember that now.

[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:13.120]
That was years ago.

[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:13.980]
Boy, you got a memory.

[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.060]
Yeah, that phony would come under and say, hey, just rub a little bit of this in it.

[00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:18.520]
And of course, we don't know what he was aware.

[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:20.640]
But let's get serious, Pat.

[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:21.040]
Okay.

[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:22.000]
Give it a rest.

[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.400]
Payphone in Miami.

[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:23.820]
Hello.

[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:25.760]
Nice.

[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:26.220]
Yeah.

[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:27.900]
On a payphone they hung up.

[00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:30.960]
That's a real jackass.

[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:32.800]
You know what somebody who'd call from a hello?

[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:33.300]
Hello.

[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:36.200]
Like I said, are you on a payphone?

[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:36.740]
Yeah.

[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.360]
Well, how come you're not speaking?

[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:39.000]
Oh.

[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:40.600]
What are you doing?

[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:41.420]
Huh?

[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:41.800]
Huh?

[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:43.480]
I was arguing with this blue hair.

[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:44.200]
Oh, okay.

[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.240]
She wants to use the phone.

[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:46.880]
Tell her to drop dead.

[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:47.860]
Drop dead.

[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:48.720]
Okay.

[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:50.060]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:51.240]
Okay.

[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.720]
I'm corneal.

[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:53.140]
Yeah.

[00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:54.560]
You're not on a payphone.

[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:55.480]
I am.

[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:56.160]
Where?

[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:57.340]
At the mall.

[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:01.320]
It must be the diplomat mall, man, because it is so quiet that you could hear a pin drop.

[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:02.940]
Um...

[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:05.100]
You can hear that lady's teeth drop right on the floor.

[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.700]
Get a reglass of polo that in B-nice, will you?

[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:09.480]
How old are you?

[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:10.820]
I'm 14.

[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:11.420]
14.

[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:12.840]
What happened to school?

[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:14.760]
Um...

[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:15.100]
Cutting.

[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:16.040]
Cutting.

[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:17.100]
You're cutting, huh?

[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:17.540]
Yeah.

[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:18.040]
Yeah.

[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:18.480]
Okay.

[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:19.660]
What do you want?

[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:22.800]
I just wanted to tell you...

[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:23.400]
Hi.

[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.420]
Oh, okay.

[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:24.740]
Hi.

[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:25.920]
I was talking to you.

[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:27.420]
28 past 11 at WIOD.

[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:28.900]
Now that was good.

[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.800]
He was great, but he told the old lady to drop dead.

[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:31.340]
That's nice.

[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:32.720]
I mean, you didn't mean it literally.

[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:33.240]
Did he?

[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:34.080]
Mm-hmm.

[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:34.720]
Figuratively.

[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:36.020]
He meant it like take a walk.

[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:36.920]
Get out of my life.

[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:37.640]
Get lost.

[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:39.360]
Oh, man.

[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:41.820]
Those condo people, boy, I'm Tony.

[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:42.560]
It's...

[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:45.940]
When they built, see, it's the developers who have destroyed this state.

[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:48.620]
The developers, because they've catered to that.

[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:53.980]
It's like they've built this creeping gigantic outdoor funeral parlour, and now we're all

[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:59.660]
suffering from these greedy developers who just wanted to jam all these old people, you

[00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:01.020]
know, in God's waiting room.

[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.560]
And now the rest of us pay for it.

[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:05.500]
Big time.

[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:06.400]
Mm-hmm.

[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.980]
Maybe we ought to go after the developers and bring them in here.

[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:13.540]
I have them explain why don't they build a lot of nice housing for, you know, middle-aged

[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:14.740]
people and young couples.

[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:15.620]
I don't know.

[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:19.260]
And people with children and pets and life in their house.

[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:20.860]
I don't know.

[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:23.500]
Well, maybe we ought to make them answer it.

[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.700]
Maybe Sharon's listening in the other room, she can book about ten shows per Steve.

[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.700]
About the developers who have created this.

[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:33.280]
And when they built the first condos on Miami Beach, that was the kiss of death.

[00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:35.280]
The kiss of death.

[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:39.040]
But I don't want to get too modeling, because poor Lauderdale is going to be next.

[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:41.160]
We have an open line in date, 751.

[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:43.420]
W-I-O-D will go to Pompano.

[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:43.700]
Hello.

[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:44.640]
Hi, Uncle Neil.

[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:45.260]
How you doing today?

[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:45.740]
Okay.

[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:46.540]
How you doing, Nudelus?

[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:48.340]
Uh, I got a horror story.

[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:49.480]
The ultimate horror story.

[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.780]
Don't call me Nudel.

[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:51.460]
Not a good news.

[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:52.020]
He's really upset.

[00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:53.100]
That's a shot, sir.

[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.080]
Yes, it is.

[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:59.140]
By the way, I was, I'm in the service industry and I was doing some work down in the Calendale

[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:01.320]
apartment, or the condos two days ago.

[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:01.860]
Uh-huh.

[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:08.540]
And this old lady and her decrepit old husband were there and he was going to go golfing.

[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.480]
And she has this little canis outfit on.

[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:14.180]
Like you see in the movie with Chris Edward or whatnot and all them where.

[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.940]
And he goes golfing and she goes into the bathroom.

[00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:17.840]
And I'm going.

[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:19.580]
Uh, Chris Everett.

[00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:20.600]
Oh, Chris Everett.

[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:22.060]
I got that now.

[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:25.120]
I thought maybe there was another one of those tennis players sex changes or something

[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:25.600]
like that.

[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:25.740]
Very possible.

[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:26.640]
You know how that works.

[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:31.600]
But anyway, he gone to the bathroom when she come out and I was doing what I had to

[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:35.320]
do and she's standing there in front of me and I'm taking my steps to or my ladder.

[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:37.320]
I'm checking out her air conditioner unit.

[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.200]
You're checking out her unit?

[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:39.860]
It's checking out.

[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:40.460]
It believed me.

[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:41.560]
Well, what she showed me.

[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:43.760]
Is that isn't moon units, sir?

[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.020]
But a big moon.

[00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:46.080]
Okay.

[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:47.040]
She's walking along.

[00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:48.780]
She sees a piece of string on the floor.

[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:50.020]
And I'm walking right behind her.

[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:53.900]
Once you do, but bend over at the knees to pick it up and there it's just like Harry

[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:55.420]
from Harry and Harrison's looking at me.

[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:56.620]
There was, she's got nothing on.

[00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:59.120]
And she's about 80 years old.

[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.600]
You guys dropped your lunch yet.

[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.500]
It was absolutely horrible.

[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:08.340]
She turned around and she winked.

[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.760]
Oh, my God.

[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.580]
And honest to God, it was right in the face there.

[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.380]
I mean, I couldn't believe I dropped my laugh.

[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:17.880]
You imagine if Michelle Gillan and Walter Cronice would have been there.

[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.440]
It would have been winking, blinking and nod.

[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:21.720]
Thumbs would have been nodding the way she was looking.

[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:22.580]
Yeah, I believe that.

[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.180]
That is a shocking story.

[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:24.800]
That is a horror.

[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.820]
But that wasn't the worst of it.

[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:27.860]
The worst of it was I had to go into that.

[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.160]
She's got an air conditioner unit and she has her vents going into her closet so her clothes

[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.360]
don't get hot evidently.

[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.280]
But they were hot.

[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.860]
But anyway, I'm in there and I'm in there.

[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.560]
Do you understand what this man is talking about?

[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.560]
If she squeezes in there behind me, she squeezes one.

[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.800]
To herself into the closet by its room.

[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.160]
She's got a few claws and clothes.

[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.600]
There's not room for one person there.

[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.880]
She squeezes in behind me.

[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:50.260]
This is a horror story.

[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.480]
On top of the ladder I have, and I turn around and there she is looking.

[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:58.320]
And she's got the skirt up to her waist tucked into the top of her outfit.

[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.880]
This is about as gross as I couldn't believe it.

[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.640]
I just I just turn around and I was going to.

[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.680]
Well, maybe she was one of Steve's crotch watchers, sir.

[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:06.600]
Did you ever think about that?

[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:09.280]
Very possible because he lives with your station all the time.

[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.080]
Yeah, there he goes.

[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:14.960]
Steve is planning these ideas and minds of these old ladies and econdos and now they're

[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:15.700]
going nuts, man.

[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:17.240]
They can't control themselves anymore.

[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.760]
But I came on you, Steve.

[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:22.680]
I turned around and I walked out the door and I left all the tools there and I went back

[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.880]
to the company and told them what happened.

[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:26.800]
I refused to go back and they found a sense of somebody else back to get them.

[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.360]
But it was the most unbelievable sight you'd never want to see.

[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:32.160]
They sent somebody back to retrieve your tool, huh?

[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:32.860]
Exactly.

[01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:33.660]
It was buried.

[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:34.220]
Okay.

[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.440]
Well, listen, good luck to you, sir.

[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.040]
And I hope something better comes up for you.

[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.320]
Yeah, I really do.

[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.760]
I enjoy you guys in the midday.

[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:40.380]
Okay.

[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.400]
And midday to you, too.

[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:43.160]
It's 11.30.

[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.840]
Oh, you know what we forgot to play?

[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:45.500]
Uh-oh.

[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.740]
What day is this?

[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.080]
Friday, Americans.

[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:49.680]
Where the hell is that?

[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.180]
How about under age?

[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:53.080]
Does that work anymore?

[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.460]
How come you got under gene?

[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.860]
What the hell did you do with it?

[01:01:59.040 --> 01:01:59.620]
Yeah, right.

[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.640]
How about P for Paul?

[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:04.980]
We believe that story?

[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:06.260]
There's Paul Harvey.

[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:07.780]
Is that the one?

[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:07.860]

[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:08.920]
Oh, no.

[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.800]
I'm going to only Roger start messing around with our stuff again.

[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:12.380]
Uh-oh.

[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:15.260]
Well, heart problems.

[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.220]
Oh, boy.

[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:20.740]
He's li-ent-n-n-n-o-t.

[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.240]
Uh, gosh.

[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.520]
No, no, Paul Harvey.

[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:26.020]
Boy, this is pretty shocking, you know what, isn't it?

[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.040]
And there's anchor with the whip.

[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.660]
Now, you know they don't play that on Reneerie.

[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.640]
You know that beyond the shadow of a doubt, right?

[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:34.020]
How could it not be there?

[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:34.760]
One more.

[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.020]
Okay, one more.

[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.120]
It's in green.

[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.460]
I mean, it's in green.

[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.980]
It's in green.

[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:42.360]
Uh-huh.

[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.360]
You're filing, sister man.

[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:44.800]
Sucks.

[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:46.300]
Really sucks.

[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.440]
Do you have a problem with that?

[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:47.720]
Yeah.

[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:50.840]
Boy, oh boy, silly me.

[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:52.040]
I should have been looking under F.

[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.300]
Good morning, Americans.

[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:55.380]
Hits Friday.

[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.540]
Yeah, all of that effort for that, okay?

[01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.700]
It was worth it and more.

[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.380]
Okay, we got a call in Boca.

[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:00.720]
Hello.

[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:01.840]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:02.440]
Yeah.

[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:03.440]
What's going on?

[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.500]
Well, if you heard the last call, sir, that you'd give you a pretty good tip off.

[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:07.420]
I heard it.

[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.220]
Um, listen.

[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:11.640]
I was watching television the other night.

[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:12.640]
Wait a minute.

[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:13.740]
Are you going to eat more now?

[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.680]
Are you eating more?

[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:18.420]
If Linda is listening in neutral system, not only because I got a note, she's proud of

[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:19.060]
me for not cheating.

[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.180]
Not only am I not cheating, but I'm being subjected to torture here.

[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.520]
This bird is going bananas here.

[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:25.620]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:26.000]
I'm sorry.

[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.620]
Um, I was watching television the other night the other night.

[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:29.880]
Yeah.

[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.500]
And I thought one of those millions of improv shows.

[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:32.800]
Yeah.

[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:38.900]
And, um, I turned in on the last few minutes of it and Johnny Darn was on stage.

[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:39.380]
No.

[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:40.260]
No.

[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:41.620]
Oh, wait a minute.

[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:42.200]
Hold on, sir.

[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:42.900]
Can you hold on?

[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.540]
Hold on, because we got to do the break in April.

[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:48.060]
It's really, surely she goes nuts if we do the have a wait for one of these calls.

[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:48.980]
Here's a little carton.

[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:49.140]
Male.

[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.160]
This is the first carton.

[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.200]
Probably that just came in.

[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:51.560]
Yeah.

[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:53.300]
Look at that.

[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:55.980]
I hope he can buy the way.

[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:56.400]
Oh, yeah.

[01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:57.360]
You saw the boon in the box.

[01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:58.000]
All right.

[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:58.660]
It's 11.30.

[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:04.000]
April has a news update and will come right back with our exciting Boca caller on 610 WIOD.

[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:07.220]
Morning.

[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:07.800]
I'm April.

[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:09.740]
It's Friday.

[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:11.120]
Today, 22 till noon.

[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:11.740]
Are you still there?

[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.020]
I'm still here.

[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:13.580]
Thank God.

[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:14.940]
Man, you must have an exciting life.

[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.220]
It's incredibly exciting.

[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.460]
It's worth a sacrifice and, to be honest with me.

[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:19.880]
It is.

[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.340]
There's nothing else like calling the Neil Rogers.

[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:23.660]
Especially when you live in this town.

[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:24.100]
Exactly.

[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.660]
Nothing else to do besides college.

[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:27.920]
So I was watching television.

[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:28.400]
Later night.

[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:30.680]
By the way, if it sounds like I'm ignoring you, we're opening the mail.

[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:31.460]
We got a ton of mail.

[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.360]
So don't feel hurt or wounded.

[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:34.220]
Don't be skinned.

[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:35.520]
I'll try not to.

[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:38.260]
I was watching television about last Thursday night.

[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:42.200]
It was like 1130 a.m. and Neil Probe was on as usual.

[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:50.420]
I just turned in in the last minute or two and the guy, the announcer for the show, came

[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.220]
on stage and said, thank you ladies and gentlemen.

[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:53.340]
That was Johnny Darts.

[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.140]
By the way, here's another.

[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:56.900]
Here's another.

[01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:01.180]
This is from Coconut Creek and it's another $20 check with no tape.

[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.440]
It's got a stamp cell for the stove and no tape.

[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.040]
But I'm not going to throw it out like somebody I know would do.

[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.920]
I'm going to try to do my best.

[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.360]
So anyway, Johnny Darts.

[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:13.900]
You mean we went through all of this just to hear Johnny Darts.

[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.640]
No, and then I was listening to...

[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.240]
Would you call him from John's house or something?

[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:17.760]
Right.

[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.940]
See these guys in a business who are out of work, they feel if you keep mentioning their

[01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:22.920]
name a lot, that somebody will hear it.

[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:24.080]
I start when you...

[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:25.480]
Here's another one.

[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:28.060]
Here's another check with an envelope and no tape.

[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:29.900]
Maybe they just want to hear it.

[01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:30.900]
Are these people out of please?

[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.920]
Let me say it again very clearly.

[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:37.680]
Okay, when you send in your $20 check and you want one of these cassettes, you have

[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.160]
to send us a blank 90 minute cassette.

[01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:40.960]
Have I...

[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.980]
I guess I failed to say that more than 7,800 times as my class.

[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:44.260]
I guess.

[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.940]
Man, you talk about some slow people.

[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:47.660]
But that's okay.

[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.360]
Well, I'll go out and buy some tape.

[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.440]
They can't get it right.

[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.060]
I only donated a grand so I'll go out and buy some tapes.

[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.640]
Yeah, go ahead, sir.

[01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:56.720]
So I would...

[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.460]
I mean you're not finished?

[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:57.960]
No.

[01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.540]
I think you were finished before you started with this call.

[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:02.520]
No, I'm not going to be chronic.

[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:03.300]
Go ahead.

[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:07.560]
So then I was listening to the radio the other day and I heard that puppy boots was appearing

[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.360]
somewhere in Florida.

[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:09.260]
Is it a tomorrow?

[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.260]
Yeah, it's tomorrow on the Ernie Soaching Show.

[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.980]
It's going to be live from the brick oven Pitzer Rear.

[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:15.740]
Another one.

[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:19.400]
Here's another envelope with a check and a stamp self-adreced envelope.

[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.360]
Are these people out of their cotton-picking minds?

[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.020]
They must be.

[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:23.860]
I think the bird is right.

[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.140]
I think I'm going to throw those away.

[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.200]
Because they just really have met it.

[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:27.500]
I know.

[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:31.320]
See, they will figure they can get away with this because, you know, Neil being soft-hearted

[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.360]
and a strong...

[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:32.780]
That's right.

[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.820]
We'll go out and do the orders as well.

[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:35.860]
Or is this for these people, you know?

[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:36.040]

[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.040]
I've been through all this for these people before.

[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:38.920]
I know all these people.

[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:40.520]
I mean, then there'll be the first ones to call.

[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.580]
Well, I didn't get my tape.

[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:43.400]
I think you were 25 and I went check it.

[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.340]
I didn't get my damn tape.

[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.400]
What's wrong with you people?

[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:46.360]
Every...

[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:49.320]
Or maybe if you'd send us a tape, you might get a tape, you idiots.

[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:50.840]
They'll never admit it.

[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:51.160]
Cheers.

[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:52.400]
Neil.

[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:53.800]
I'm getting emotional, sir.

[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:55.980]
Man, you've been on a long time and having said a damn thing.

[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:56.700]
You've been almost done.

[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:57.300]
Almost done.

[01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:57.900]
Thank God.

[01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.500]
You've been on like a lifetime.

[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.080]
You've been on through the news.

[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.800]
You've been on through two books here.

[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:07.060]
In fact, I get the feeling you're the only person I've talked to the whole show so far.

[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.280]
I used to call you when you were on Zeta.

[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.540]
Yeah, what did you call me, sir?

[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:16.380]
And I kept asking you to make an appearance at Palm Beach Community College.

[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:18.180]
Oh, this guy, yeah.

[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.800]
You are chronic, you're right.

[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.460]
And I told you no then and I will tell you no again now, sir, okay?

[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:25.880]
Come on, Neil.

[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:32.280]
When I get my thousand dollar check from Lee Fowler for Camilla's house, then I will make my appearance at Palm Beach Junior College.

[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.060]
Okay, how's that?

[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:33.580]
Okay.

[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:34.800]
It's a call them up.

[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:35.920]
Give them the challenge, okay?

[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:42.320]
Tom, you were rid of those boring guests that Steve had on two weeks ago and do something constructive for once in his life.

[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.160]
I don't know if we make it down here.

[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:47.920]
Because I got his resume right in my briefcase here and if he doesn't come through, man, he's in big trouble.

[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.380]
What if we make a donation to Camilla?

[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:50.740]
For what?

[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.160]
For you to appear.

[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:57.240]
Yeah, I got told you, when Lee Fowler gives his thousand dollar check, that's when I'll come up to Palm Beach.

[01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:58.400]
Okay, Neil.

[01:07:58.580 --> 01:07:59.380]
Okay, good luck to you, sir.

[01:07:59.440 --> 01:07:59.780]
Is that it?

[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.120]
Because I don't want to cut you short now.

[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.640]
You've only been out about half an hour.

[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:03.280]
Oh, all right.

[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:03.720]
I can't.

[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:04.460]
Have a great life.

[01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:04.900]
Bye-bye.

[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.840]
What is Mike Disney doing there?

[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:09.320]
Looking good.

[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:09.980]
He's putting the box.

[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.560]
Oh, he's got his own personal.

[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:11.880]
He's putting the box.

[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:12.700]
That's great.

[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:18.760]
Yeah, just think of the Lord and the Bible when you look at that peddler, his peddling religion, acne cream, anything he can.

[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:21.340]
I'll go over there, a couple of hundred dollar checks.

[01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:23.000]
These are good checks today, by the way.

[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:24.900]
50s and 25s.

[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.620]
Well, I could have a good time at Pompo'no with this.

[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:30.540]
No, I've been plunging my-

[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:35.520]
Well, I had not really plunged in luck because I'm just a real small time gambler now, but I haven't been doing well at Pompo'no.

[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:36.480]
I go up there a lot now.

[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.640]
Now that Alan Kiston made up, you know, for the 80th time.

[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:40.280]
Mm-hmm.

[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:42.820]
And I think I'm keeping them open as a matter of fact.

[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:43.560]
Really?

[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:45.060]
Big matron steak tomorrow night.

[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:48.060]
Big race, $150,000 per set, Pompo'no tomorrow night.

[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:49.020]
I just thought I'd mention that.

[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:49.900]
So Alan doesn't get upset.

[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.740]
Here's two checks and one thing here.

[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:54.140]
Now they don't want to tape do they now.

[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:58.060]
What are we going to do seriously about these people who just send the envelopes?

[01:08:59.040 --> 01:08:59.400]
I don't know.

[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:00.340]
Oh, here's a nice letter.

[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:03.700]
Oh, isn't this interesting?

[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:08.960]
This is from the lady who called the other day from the good shepherd Lutheran Church.

[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:09.420]
Mm-hmm.

[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:14.720]
And she closes by saying, there's some other stuff in here that I can't refer to.

[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:18.740]
But she closes by saying we love you here at the church.

[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:20.160]
Mm-hmm.

[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.480]
Oh, this is an excellent letter.

[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:22.640]
In fact, yeah.

[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:23.180]
Yeah.

[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.240]
So anyway, let's save that over there.

[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:27.100]
143.

[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:28.720]
Boy, is that wishful thinking or what?

[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:30.460]
It's almost time to go home.

[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.220]
Oh, God.

[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:34.380]
See, when you start opening the mail, the whole damn thing flies by.

[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:34.640]
It doesn't?

[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.040]
1143 at WIOD.

[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.520]
And our next call is in Haya, Liyah.

[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:39.760]
Hello.

[01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:41.180]
Hi, Nail, it's Chuckie.

[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:42.380]
Chronic.

[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:43.260]
Chronic, man.

[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:44.860]
Chronic, big time, Chuckie.

[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:45.420]
Yeah, well.

[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:47.980]
You're getting really a little carried away, pal.

[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.540]
Well, you see the thing is, I'm chronic.

[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:49.780]
Chronic.

[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.920]
I'm all by my loathsome in this office, man.

[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000]
And it gets like ponderous.

[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:54.060]
So what the hell does that have to do?

[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:56.300]
I can't, you know, be responsible for your problem.

[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.340]
Call up Dr. Vots.

[01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:58.280]
No, no, no.

[01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.060]
Call up Michael DeSisto.

[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.360]
Hey, listen, Nail, what's the zip code there?

[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.300]
So I can send you my tape.

[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:04.560]
33141.

[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.200]
33141.

[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:07.620]
I'm going too fast for you, Chuckie.

[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.880]
No, that's just plain WIOD, Miami Floor.

[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:10.460]
Just play it.

[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:11.220]
Put that on the envelope.

[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:12.760]
Just plain WIOD.

[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:13.960]
Okay, hey, Nail.

[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:19.220]
Because the postman here in North Bay Village, if you put just any old WIOD, they'll probably deliver it to WS News.

[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:19.980]
It'll probably.

[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:20.800]
WOLD.

[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:21.600]
Yeah, I know him.

[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:22.200]
I'll wait a minute.

[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:23.580]
There's something really strange.

[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.120]
You'll hear some old unbelievable, an old unbelievable Zeta button.

[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:29.020]
Isn't that great?

[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:29.900]
Boy.

[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:31.060]
But where's your check, Rose?

[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:31.900]
I don't see it here.

[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.000]
And another envelope.

[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:35.700]
Oh, this has got to be a mistake.

[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:36.660]
No, there's a tape.

[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:37.200]
Oh, good.

[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:40.100]
Now, Chuckie, we're not going to hear from you on Monday, are we?

[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:40.420]
No.

[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:41.000]
Good.

[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:41.760]
Why is that?

[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:43.660]
I'm going on a CSK, I'm Monday.

[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:44.300]
Oh, great.

[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:46.260]
I hope you have a good time and stay there for a long time.

[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:47.100]
Now, look at this.

[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:49.280]
Here's Amy, an 8-year-old girl.

[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.620]
Was there a tape in there?

[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.200]
Oh, there is a tape.

[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:52.580]
Mm-hmm.

[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:53.140]
And a check.

[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:59.480]
An 8-year-old Amy, please send me the funny tape in green crayon.

[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:01.520]
Wait a minute.

[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.080]
Is this Chuckie or is this up-chucky?

[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:04.840]
I just eaten lunch, Nail.

[01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:05.360]
What up?

[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:07.600]
What a disgusting, vulgar pig.

[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.740]
I can't believe it.

[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:10.240]
Yeah, well, I learned it from you, Nail.

[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:12.300]
Okay, well listen, have a great day, Chuckie.

[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:12.760]
All right, Nail.

[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:12.940]
Bye.

[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.400]
Open line in day now at 751-WI-W-I-W-D-Those Palm Beach Lines are dead of them.

[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:19.520]
They proverbial doornail.

[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:21.860]
This is getting, we need fat rich here every day.

[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:22.360]
We really do.

[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.080]
He can't, seriously.

[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:26.900]
He doesn't have time to be mucking around with his business and making a little.

[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:28.920]
I'm telling you the truth, I can't.

[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:32.280]
We just don't have time to screw around with all that other stuff in his life.

[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:36.460]
He took it upon himself to be responsible for all of this, didn't he?

[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:37.740]
That's how I remember it.

[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:38.140]
Yeah.

[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:40.620]
And if he's going to do it, you got to do it right.

[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.560]
278WI-O-D in Boka and 655WI-O-D in Palm Beach.

[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:47.720]
Just in case there's anybody alive up there.

[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.540]
And our next call is in plantation.

[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:50.080]
Hello.

[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:51.720]
How you doing, Nail?

[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:52.260]
Mr. Jerry.

[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:53.440]
How's Jerry?

[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:55.260]
Jerry, yes, yes.

[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:56.060]
Okay, Jerry.

[01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:59.780]
Is this a preamble to a rabbinical student's crotch-watching update?

[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:00.500]
Yeah.

[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.460]
I got a pompinous story for it.

[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:05.900]
I was there for Maclub Bell.

[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.120]
A couple weeks ago, what was happening was two-ten across the board.

[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:13.920]
So they're doing this big shoe bang after the race.

[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:17.240]
They bring out this huge cake and they cut in the cake.

[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:21.660]
They have about 75 gray hairs out there and a couple of blues.

[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:24.780]
And they're, they finally hit a triple.

[01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:27.120]
First time I ever hit a triple in my life.

[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:27.960]
Not in that race.

[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.140]
Yeah, but as I said.

[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:31.140]
What a pay five bucks?

[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:31.540]
Ten.

[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:33.180]
So I'm jumping up and down.

[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:35.040]
I'm going, well, at least I broke through.

[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:36.400]
I'm finally there.

[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:41.900]
So they move everybody out to the, to the middle of the track right in front of the board.

[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:45.120]
And all of a sudden I see the third horse start flashing.

[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.780]
And I'm like dying because I'm seeing this red light going off.

[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.480]
And I'm going, I don't believe this.

[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:52.660]
And I'm trying to stand on people's shoulders for look.

[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:54.500]
And they brought my horse down.

[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.540]
They probably broke it the wire right left on break.

[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:57.380]
Oh, man.

[01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:58.500]
It was bad news.

[01:12:58.640 --> 01:12:59.660]
If I were you, I'd stay away.

[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:00.140]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:03.940]
Anybody that's got that because you know what the try probably paid in that race about 20 bucks.

[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:06.800]
If I, if I was lucky or less definitely.

[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:09.680]
So I'm heading up to Newark today also.

[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:13.400]
No, you got to be, you got to be pulling my leg, okay?

[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:17.040]
Now I'm going up to see a girlfriend of mine up there.

[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:17.740]
In Newark?

[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:21.400]
Well, in, in New York area, but we're going through Newark Airport.

[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:23.540]
I hear it's freezing up there.

[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:24.100]
Mm-hmm.

[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:24.900]
Oh, that's right.

[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:25.500]
Try.

[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.660]
Johnny Doc's story.

[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:34.920]
She, when, let's see, when I was first started off over, when he came back from Cleveland on AM up in New York.

[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:39.440]
She supposedly won a night out with I'mus or whatever.

[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:39.860]
Yeah.

[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.360]
By the way, there's 500 bucks in this little bench right here.

[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.160]
So we're really, we're going nuts here today.

[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:45.440]
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:45.880]
Okay.

[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:48.700]
I keep interrupting the callers, but that's because most of them are so terminal.

[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:49.480]
Okay.

[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.100]
Not you, sir.

[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:50.540]
Not yet.

[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.040]
But you're working on it.

[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:52.720]
I am.

[01:13:52.720 --> 01:14:01.160]
So she goes over to meet I'mus for her dialed data, whatever it was, whatever they called it at that point in time.

[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:02.440]
And who shows up?

[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.800]
But that's Johnny Doc.

[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:08.520]
So she is actually a Johnny Doc data, if you will.

[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:13.600]
What does it deal with you in plantation and channel six?

[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:17.240]
Because I live in plantation and this channel six is the pit.

[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.000]
I could, I can't believe cable down here.

[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:22.000]
Interesting segue, I like the segue.

[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.400]
Okay, well listen, I have a wonderful live.

[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:25.980]
I have no idea what you just said, but it really did a great job.

[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:26.580]
Okay.

[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:27.040]
Okay.

[01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:27.980]
Thank you.

[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.420]
Dave County, hello.

[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:32.020]
Hi Neil, this is the lady at the church.

[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:32.800]
Yes.

[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:33.460]
Yes.

[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.540]
I know Senator, did you mention my letter on the air?

[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:37.980]
I won't mention any names.

[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.700]
No, we can't discuss any of the personalities involved.

[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.180]
Right, I wouldn't do that.

[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:46.580]
But what legal action could be taken against harassment?

[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:49.720]
What probably a call to the phone company and maybe a call to the police?

[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:51.260]
Both of those would be a real good idea.

[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:55.340]
Yeah, maybe I'll start with my attorney, the church's attorney.

[01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:55.740]
Okay.

[01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.620]
Yeah, I just wanted to know.

[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:00.060]
Yeah, it's a free country and if you enjoy the show and you want to listen to it,

[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.700]
you shouldn't be harassed for a listening.

[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:07.180]
This is true and especially when the threat is that the past of the church will be punished.

[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:11.200]
And you know, we want to know who your boss is and that kind of stuff.

[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:11.420]
Yeah.

[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.100]
Yeah, this is getting a little silly.

[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.260]
Okay, well I'd make couple of calls.

[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.560]
Yeah, okay, well thank you.

[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:19.520]
Okay, you have a good weekend.

[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.020]
You too.

[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:21.520]
Under the circumstances.

[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:24.000]
I mean, this is really strange.

[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:26.040]
I think I'll start playing for the channel man.

[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:26.380]
Okay.

[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:27.100]
Bye.

[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:30.360]
It's 11 till noon at WIOD.

[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.120]
It's a really strange world isn't it?

[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.480]
And we have an open line in Broward.

[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:37.520]
524 WIOD and 1 in date, 751-9463.

[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.800]
751-WIOD will come right back.

[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:41.860]
No Roger.

[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:45.000]
Our new stock radio 610-WIOD.

[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.820]
It's 11.52, 8 minutes till noon at WIOD.

[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:50.100]
We're going to see and see with open phones this afternoon,

[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:51.520]
Hank on sports talk tonight.

[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:54.100]
And I think we got the Keynes basketball too, and I don't way.

[01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:57.560]
It's Miami and where they playing?

[01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.800]
They're playing Piper high also.

[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:02.900]
Okay, let's go to a mobile.

[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:03.800]
And now that's gone.

[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:04.620]
Mobile is gone.

[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:05.440]
Oh, excuse me.

[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:08.420]
I'm getting choked up from this horrendous stogie that Alan gave me at the track.

[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.520]
Port St. Lucy.

[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:09.880]
Hello.

[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:10.740]
Hello Neil.

[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:11.160]
Yeah.

[01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:11.660]
How you doing?

[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:12.240]
Okay.

[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.860]
Listen, I know you don't probably not get too many calls from Port St. Lucy.

[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:17.400]
Wow, once in a while.

[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:17.880]
Once in a while.

[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.080]
And you least expect it.

[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:20.380]
And you least expect it.

[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:20.380]

[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:20.380]

[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:20.380]

[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:24.180]
But we do have our share of, you know, decaf, decaf, decaf.

[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:25.120]
You know.

[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:29.100]
But I just want to say that you and the Berder doing a great job.

[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:32.180]
And if I may call one guy a real-life douchebag.

[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:32.940]
Absolutely.

[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:36.980]
Jack Kerman, who does the sports for radio station up here,

[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.880]
doesn't know his ass from third base when it comes to sports.

[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:41.420]
And he's a douchebag, okay?

[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:43.160]
Well, I'm telling you one thing.

[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:46.100]
If you check out third base up there in the stadium, you know, Westpaw.

[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.060]
You're going to be shocked.

[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:49.200]
All right.

[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.440]
Well, I have a good day, Neil, and you two, Berder.

[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:51.920]
Okay.

[01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:52.500]
Thanks a lot.

[01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:54.160]
1153.

[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:55.480]
And our next call.

[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:57.640]
We do get some calls from Port St. Lucy, don't we?

[01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:57.760]
Yeah.

[01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:57.800]

[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:58.400]
And again, sure.

[01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.300]
Every once in a while.

[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.280]
And some from a Jensen Beach.

[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:03.080]
And I, so does it have an event?

[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:03.540]
What's that?

[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:04.420]
Nile Rogers.

[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:05.080]
Yeah.

[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:06.180]
N-I-E-L.

[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:06.580]
Hey, listen.

[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.940]
We don't give them points for spelling.

[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:08.280]
Okay.

[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:10.080]
They can't all be but looking ducks.

[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:10.660]
Like that.

[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:11.620]
Pombi, chillo.

[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:12.860]
Oh, Neil, how you doing?

[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:13.540]
Great.

[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:14.160]
This is John.

[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:15.960]
Okay, John, whatever you say.

[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:17.780]
How's Luke and Paul doing, John?

[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:18.940]
Pretty good.

[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:20.380]
This isn't Jewish, John, is it?

[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:21.020]
No.

[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:21.640]
I don't know.

[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:24.100]
That is just Pombi, that works in Deerfield.

[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:25.680]
You know, chronic John.

[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:26.380]
Oh, yeah.

[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:27.380]
Oh, chronic John.

[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.240]
Why didn't you just say chronic John?

[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:30.140]
Then we would have known.

[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.540]
Neil, did you listen to the show yesterday?

[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:35.300]
To Steve's?

[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:37.260]
I talked about it before if you had been listening.

[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:38.620]
Well, you think I'm in the office right now?

[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:41.360]
Well, we didn't give you any permission to slip, not to be listening, okay?

[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:42.620]
It's the only time I could listen to this.

[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:46.840]
It gets me hysterical when I hear these condo commandos, man.

[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:49.160]
A dood young people around make all these different excuses.

[01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:49.900]
It's the law.

[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:50.760]
It's in the rules.

[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:55.600]
Did you hear the lady that called up and told him he should die?

[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.620]
Yeah, that he's a bastard and he should drop dead.

[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.600]
He should drop dead before he gets old.

[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:03.500]
Another one of those real, nice, cultured, senior citizens that we're over.

[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.760]
The kind of drop their teeth and the polo that right in the middle of your lunch.

[01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:11.680]
Anyway, I was listening to that at the time I was driving now

[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:16.280]
Pymage likes Boulevard and I came to a stoplight and I noticed that the gentleman

[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.360]
sitting next to me was about 170.

[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:18.880]
Yeah.

[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:20.420]
And his car was in reverse.

[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:23.080]
Okay.

[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.300]
His car was in reverse?

[01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:24.680]
Right.

[01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:25.520]
How was he?

[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:26.740]
Was he a French Canadian?

[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:28.520]
No, he, I don't know.

[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:29.360]
He had Florida tags.

[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:32.040]
He could have been a reload kid.

[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:33.060]
Anyway.

[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.500]
Right before the light turn grade of cop pulled up behind him.

[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:39.060]
Now listen, I'm listening to the show.

[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:41.620]
I'm thinking, you know, what would Uncle Neil do?

[01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.700]
You know, in a fit, should I tell the guy his car is in reverse?

[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:46.360]
I opted not to.

[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.420]
Anyway, light turn grade he stepped on the gas and backed right into the cop.

[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.100]
So I got a kick out of it.

[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:53.600]
Excellent.

[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:55.960]
I got a good story made my whole weekend.

[01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:57.720]
It was funny.

[01:18:58.060 --> 01:18:58.200]
Yeah.

[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:00.740]
And I'll never forget it.

[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:03.920]
But before I go, listen, Neil, let me call Al.

[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:06.660]
It popped each a subhuman douchebag.

[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:10.840]
And my friend marked the lawyer a real douchebag.

[01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:11.580]
Okay, sir.

[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.780]
And before you go?

[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:13.900]
Yeah, before we go.

[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:14.420]
Good day.

[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:15.000]
Okay.

[01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:17.700]
Oh, God.

[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:18.540]
Oh no.

[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:20.440]
Good morning, Americans.

[01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:22.480]
It's Friday.

[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:23.720]
Pompano, hello.

[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:25.580]
Pompano.

[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:26.740]
That's your grandfather.

[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:28.900]
Oh, this is good.

[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:32.020]
We came in in the middle of a little something that's going on here.

[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:32.800]
Yeah, I like this.

[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:32.980]
Yeah.

[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.080]
Pretty soon, sooner or later, they'll discover.

[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:36.820]
Hello.

[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:38.980]
Those Pompano people.

[01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:41.660]
They've got the phone buried somewhere like in part of their anatomy.

[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.500]
And listening very quietly.

[01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:47.100]
I'm sure you have something critical to say.

[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:48.100]
Pompano.

[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:51.060]
It'll be real upset when he finds out he blew it.

[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:51.680]
Yeah.

[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:52.880]
Hello.

[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:53.440]
Yeah.

[01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:54.300]
Oh, Neil.

[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:54.780]
Yeah.

[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:55.940]
Hi, this is Jimmy Dunnigan.

[01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:58.240]
I just, I'm calling from Allen's office.

[01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:58.600]
Oh, yeah.

[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.740]
Well, Allen must have been the one who was bugging you well.

[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:01.880]
We were trying to say hello there.

[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:03.180]
Tell Allen to buzz off.

[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:04.900]
That's a crap, Allen.

[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:06.160]
You could tell him that better than me.

[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:06.580]
Okay.

[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:07.260]
I will, too.

[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:07.780]
Trust me.

[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.560]
We just have it a catch your show.

[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:12.660]
That's a guy that called about the night of the Mackle Bell retirement.

[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:14.000]
And he was a little off base.

[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:15.900]
There was any inquiry at all.

[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:17.840]
It was not against any of the one, two, three finishes.

[01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:20.860]
I was down in the winter circle helping with the Cape Cutting ceremony.

[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:21.320]
Yeah.

[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:25.900]
And the Mack one, go get lost a second and free token was third.

[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.020]
And it was a cold triple.

[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:31.100]
And I do believe I'm not a betting man, but I paid right around $20 with Frank.

[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:32.040]
It was the hell of a pay off.

[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:32.900]
Yeah, the big price.

[01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:34.640]
I would have thought I'd paid about seven or eight bucks.

[01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:35.380]
Well, true.

[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.440]
It was free token.

[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.480]
I had the rail in the first, second horses.

[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:40.600]
Well, you knew Gogi lost was going to be second.

[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:45.100]
Well, nobody knows anything about a horse race, but that's the way it turned out.

[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:45.460]
Yeah.

[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:47.680]
What's that?

[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:49.160]
That Allen, man.

[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:49.700]
I'm telling you.

[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:50.760]
What is Allen doing?

[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:52.160]
Tell him it's a radio show here.

[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:55.220]
The man is just absolutely out of control.

[01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:58.900]
And not only that, do you remember the carton of tapes cassettes that he gave me last night?

[01:20:59.000 --> 01:20:59.000]

[01:20:59.440 --> 01:20:59.800]
Sure.

[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:00.980]
What about them?

[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:02.000]
Oh, wait a minute.

[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:02.780]
Sharon's got a call.

[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:03.360]
That's what she's saying.

[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:03.840]
You got a call.

[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:04.540]
Sharon, get busy.

[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:05.480]
Quit reading all that mail.

[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:07.340]
What about the tapes?

[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:07.600]
Oh, yeah.

[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.000]
The tapes.

[01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:09.380]
He gives me commercials.

[01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:12.020]
There's a bunch of pompadopart commercials in there.

[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:12.920]
Nothing wrong with that.

[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:15.160]
There's only a couple of tapes that have anything on there.

[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:16.520]
I see Allen on Monday.

[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:18.260]
Tell him I'm going to do something with those tapes.

[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:18.640]
Okay.

[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:19.020]
Okay.

[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:21.960]
We got some more of that we can replace them with if you want.

[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:22.400]
Okay.

[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.640]
Some of the real races on them would be nice.

[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:25.220]
That would be great.

[01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:25.940]
We got them.

[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:26.320]
Okay.

[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:29.460]
And like I say, that was, there was no disqualification I raised.

[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.200]
It was a great ceremony.

[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.280]
It was a very fitting return.

[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:34.300]
Yeah, I wish I could have been there.

[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:34.920]
I was out of the way.

[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:35.660]
I wish you had been there.

[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:36.680]
You would have enjoyed it.

[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:37.120]
Okay.

[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:37.820]
All right, Neil.

[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:38.600]
Thanks for all the time to see you.

[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:39.220]
Thanks a lot, Jimmy.

[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:39.680]
You're welcome.

[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:41.020]
Okay.

[01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:45.100]
That Allen man, see it was Jimmy Dunnigan on there from Pompootopark and Allen's in the background coaching.

[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:47.300]
By the way, I'm choking on his cigar.

[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:48.320]
He gave me last night Allen.

[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.920]
Get some good cigars and cut the crap.

[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:50.460]
Will you please?

[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.860]
Man, he must buy these like in Little Havana or something.

[01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:56.880]
One of those ten for recorder stores.

[01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:59.160]
Boy, we got more tapes here.

[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:00.560]
Well, that's amazing.

[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:01.720]
We got cassette.

[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.740]
I'm going to talk about cassettes with stuff on it.

[01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:05.020]
Oh, all right.

[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:05.460]
Yeah.

[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.340]
Boy, the mail has been phenomenal.

[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:10.280]
Including this, it says awesome.

[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:11.080]
Oh, boy.

[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:16.300]
And here's a Jeff Striker picture, a disgusting grotesque, incredible, wonderful picture.

[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:20.440]
And it says Jeff Striker, legendary superstar, has now been immortalized.

[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:24.380]
He's by Doc Johnson with a life-size replica of his massive manhood.

[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:30.280]
And I'm definitely not reading the rest of this, but this is, um, that Jeff, I know.

[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:31.400]
What a sense of humor.

[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:32.320]
All right.

[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.440]
Listen, we're going to take a little break for the news now.

[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:37.260]
We got one open line if you'd like to get online during the news break.

[01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:40.600]
It's in Boka, of course, at 278 WIOD.

[01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:42.680]
That's 278 9463.

[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:43.720]
Surprise.

[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:48.460]
And I guess that guy who was listening earlier is probably going to go back to the track tonight and dig around see if he can find his ticket.

[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.960]
You know, it was only about two, three weeks ago, but you know, good luck to your pal.

[01:22:53.500 --> 01:23:01.040]
Okay, April's got the new news and we'll come back in 12.05 with our number three Steve with open phones this afternoon at two here on 610 WIOD.

[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:23.400]
524 WIOD in Brawler or 655 and 278 WIOD in the Palm Beach.

[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:30.160]
Other areas make all collect the opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station.

[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:35.200]
Now, here's Neil Rogers on Newstalk Radio 610 WIOD.

[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.720]
It's enough to make me puke.

[01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:39.280]
Anyway, 1206 WIOD. Just a joke, Mike.

[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:47.280]
Anyway, now it's true. I sit here and I want you eating and eating and eating and eating and every time we discuss the food that comes in on the show,

[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:50.180]
you always say, well, I'm indifferent, you know, indifferent.

[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:54.920]
But once he starts, man, it's like a bottomless pit and I'm scanning.

[01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:59.080]
Yeah, which makes me want to thank you and ahead with some very hard object.

[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.140]
I understand that.

[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:05.360]
Okay, listen, we got an open line in Palm Beach at 655 9463.

[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:06.900]
That's that famous line eight.

[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:07.740]
What is this?

[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:08.200]
I don't know.

[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:11.140]
Menu, my, my, what is this?

[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:12.100]
More food stuff?

[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:17.920]
Anyway, we got in Sharon is counting it now, but a humongous amount of money again today.

[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.600]
We did almost three grand yesterday for criminal sounds.

[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:24.360]
And today I know we got well over a grand and probably closer to two.

[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:27.820]
So we'll have a count on that, but the weekend is here now.

[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:31.100]
So like I always say, the weekend produces a mountain of mail on Monday.

[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:31.660]
Yeah.

[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:34.160]
So while you're thinking about it, you got a lot of homework to do.

[01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:40.520]
Okay, if you want your boon in the box, if you want your, uh, Camilla's house, I mean, you're a, I don't know what I'm talking about.

[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:41.100]
Your cassette.

[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:41.840]
Yeah.

[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:46.120]
Your donation for Camilla's house, but we got a seven hour show to do it only four hours to do it.

[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:46.900]
I know.

[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:48.240]
So do it this weekend.

[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:50.980]
Okay, while you're thinking about it, please include it.

[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.240]
Now this has Daytona.

[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:53.140]
Can this be for real?

[01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:54.620]
Yeah, I do a deal.

[01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:55.560]
What are you doing up there?

[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:56.540]
You can't hear us.

[01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:57.940]
No, I can't.

[01:24:57.940 --> 01:24:58.820]
Well, thank God for that.

[01:24:59.080 --> 01:24:59.500]
What?

[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.060]
Go ahead.

[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:02.080]
No, you go ahead.

[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:02.860]
You're calling it.

[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:03.980]
Who's dime is this?

[01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:04.740]
Yours.

[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:05.420]
Oh, okay.

[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:06.900]
Like I said, then you can't hear us, right?

[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:08.320]
No, I can't.

[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.660]
I think you can.

[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.920]
I tried tuning it in and there's nothing but static.

[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:13.460]
Really?

[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:15.020]
Yeah, we got a lot of static today.

[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:18.020]
But I'm up here to, you know, check it out.

[01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:20.940]
And there's nothing up for a lot of zoning.

[01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:23.360]
I'm pretty much like I came up here and it's pretty lively.

[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:27.440]
Yeah, some living and breathing people, probably some under 90 or 100, right?

[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:28.520]
Many.

[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:31.860]
I bet you there are a few who aren't even going to have their birthday on Willard Scott

[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:33.160]
on the Today Show on Monday.

[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:35.360]
Exactly, exactly.

[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:36.940]
I wish it was like that down here.

[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.520]
Yeah, well, it used to be long ago.

[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:40.940]
Long ago.

[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:41.940]
What is happening?

[01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:44.460]
What is happening here?

[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:44.940]
Yeah.

[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:46.400]
Not a thing, man.

[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:49.820]
It is so quiet you could hear a pin drop right in the middle of Biscayne Boulevard.

[01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:52.260]
Same old.

[01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:54.200]
And how are you doing, Bird?

[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:54.780]
Fine.

[01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:59.400]
And I haven't heard you guys in a couple of minutes.

[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:00.940]
Be back down in about five days.

[01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:02.040]
Five days, huh?

[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:05.760]
You think you can find enough activity up there to keep you busy for five days?

[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:07.080]
Probably.

[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:08.340]
Yeah, I would think so.

[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:09.720]
Probably five months.

[01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:10.300]
Yeah.

[01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:14.080]
Now listen, whatever you do, be sure and come back quick because everybody under 100

[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:17.240]
who leaves even for a day or two, it adds up, believe me.

[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:21.240]
There's like a dark cloud hanging over the entire Fry County area.

[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:22.900]
All right, I got a gate going here in the old.

[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:24.320]
Okay, listen, thanks for the call.

[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:25.320]
Yeah, take care of yourself, man.

[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:25.960]
Have a great time.

[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:28.280]
Okay, that's our first call from Daytona Beach.

[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:32.820]
Our first call from Daytona Beach, perhaps ever on the show, let's have a big round of applause

[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:35.120]
in the purple jelly bean and all of that good stuff.

[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:36.020]
Star, yeah.

[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.440]
Okay, menu guide.

[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:39.240]
Yeah, more food.

[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:40.300]
That's just what I needed.

[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.080]
It's got a letter which I just tore in half.

[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.240]
It's from a suppressed release.

[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:49.300]
Greater Miami menu guide, the showcase area restaurant, hotel's night clubs and attractions.

[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:52.380]
Now we can just get some living and breathing people to frequent them.

[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:53.060]
It would be great.

[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:54.640]
Oh, that's nice.

[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:55.040]
This is nice.

[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:55.600]
It's nice.

[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:57.220]
It's filled all the restaurants.

[01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:58.420]
Very nice.

[01:26:58.480 --> 01:26:59.340]
I want to go through that.

[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.240]
Angela's Cafe, Jay Philippe.

[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:03.880]
This is nice.

[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:04.760]
It's very nice.

[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:04.920]

[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:06.060]
It's awesome.

[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:06.200]
It's awesome.

[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:06.920]
One of my favorites.

[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:07.200]
Yeah.

[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:09.280]
I thought I'd mention that to get you a hysterical.

[01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:10.740]
I love one of the food this morning.

[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:12.120]
How seriously.

[01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:13.600]
You have put on display.

[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.320]
I think you hung around Captain Dave Duval.

[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:15.760]
Wow.

[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.480]
You put on a disgusting display.

[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:18.520]
It just looked disgusting.

[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:18.800]
It just looked disgusting.

[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:19.000]
It just looked disgusting.

[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:19.500]
It just looked disgusting.

[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:19.560]
It just looked disgusting.

[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.040]
I haven't consumed that much.

[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:22.400]
Well.

[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:25.200]
That's what Oprah said the other day.

[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:26.780]
Is it true that she's really picking it up again?

[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:27.620]
That's what I heard on inner-game or tonight.

[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:28.140]
That's what I heard on inner-game or tonight.

[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:29.760]
That she is just going nuts.

[01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:31.940]
That she is just shoveling it in.

[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:32.200]
Okay.

[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.260]
She's got a shoehorn that she's just jamming it in.

[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:35.880]
That's right.

[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:36.340]
They said.

[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:37.980]
Now, remember how quickly she lost it?

[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:39.280]
See, I don't believe in that.

[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:43.360]
When you go on those real extreme, like Karen Carpenter diets.

[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:46.360]
And you lose a ton of weight so fast.

[01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:47.260]
Yeah.

[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:50.240]
You gain it back just as fast as you lost it.

[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:51.820]
But they say, here's a note from Nick.

[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:55.260]
She ate four eggs Benedict and a half a cow.

[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:56.740]
A half a chicken.

[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.180]
Oh, it's a half a chicken.

[01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:58.520]
Yeah.

[01:27:58.800 --> 01:27:59.560]
That was on ET.

[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:01.340]
And that was just during a break, probably.

[01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:02.500]
And then a huge breakfast.

[01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:02.620]

[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.340]
Like this chocolate mousse.

[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:06.280]
Well, what the hell is she going to accomplish, man?

[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.560]
I see she's got a problem.

[01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:07.780]
Yeah.

[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:08.840]
She's compulsive.

[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:09.420]
That's right.

[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:10.360]
And she's up there.

[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:11.720]
And there are millions of people are watching her.

[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.120]
And using her as a role model.

[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:17.020]
And she goes on these extreme dangerous, bad thing that she's doing.

[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:18.300]
And now she's going to gain it all back.

[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:21.580]
And they're all going to be, the whole audience going to be blowing their brains out.

[01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:23.480]
And the tabloids are going to be crying.

[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:24.640]
And we'll go through that whole thing.

[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:26.720]
And the tabloids will be putting, like Elizabeth Taylor.

[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.780]
You see those horrendous pictures of her.

[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:31.480]
Or she looks like a bossy cow in drag.

[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.120]
We got a car phone in Palm Beach.

[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.380]
We better get that right on.

[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:35.660]
Hello.

[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:36.600]
Hello, Neil.

[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:37.200]
Yes, sir.

[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.080]
How you doing?

[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:38.640]
OK.

[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:39.960]
Boy, is it a beautiful day?

[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.080]
I don't hate to tell you that I know you're going to be.

[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:41.560]
OK, wait a minute.

[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:45.160]
It's your, our total for today, 1326 bucks for Camilo Sass.

[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:47.060]
We have raised in a very short time.

[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:49.720]
14,000.

[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:50.560]
Neil.

[01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:51.560]
Why are you laughing?

[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:52.580]
We're getting, sir.

[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:53.460]
Hold on a second.

[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:53.860]
I'm listening.

[01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:56.460]
14,239 bucks.

[01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:56.980]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:28:57.220 --> 01:28:57.920]
Listen, Neil.

[01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:58.200]
Yeah.

[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.660]
I just want to tell you what a great job you and the bird are doing.

[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:03.060]
You can say it again, sir.

[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:04.440]
You're doing a great job.

[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:06.520]
Even though he's the ethnic man of the talk radio.

[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:07.200]
That is correct.

[01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:15.480]
But what I want to say, maybe it's me, but it seems like you, yourself, you used to be so,

[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:19.120]
so I don't know, so, so violent before.

[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:19.760]
Violent.

[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:20.940]
Violent radio tacos.

[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:21.440]
Yeah.

[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:23.120]
I've mellowed out, sir.

[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:23.400]
Yeah.

[01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:26.100]
When you're making as much money as I am, sir, you get real mellow.

[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:28.340]
OK, so you've toned it down, eh?

[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:30.880]
But I just want to say you guys doing a great job.

[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:32.220]
I mean, let's say it again.

[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:33.200]
I told you to say it again.

[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:34.520]
You can say one more time.

[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:35.720]
You can lick a little more.

[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:38.220]
I love it.

[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:38.620]
I love it.

[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:38.760]
I love it.

[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:39.100]
Have a good day.

[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:39.800]
OK, you too.

[01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:40.740]
Nice talking to you.

[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:41.520]
He was good.

[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:42.740]
He was like, um, sorry.

[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:48.200]
See now, Nick rushes to judge me, put on there a slow-witted or dim-witted car-phone douchebag.

[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:48.800]
Well, he's right.

[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:49.480]
Nick has a point.

[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:52.220]
Anyway, 14,239.

[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:55.840]
That means by when we open a mail on Monday, we're going to go over 15.

[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:57.340]
I never dreamed we could do this.

[01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:57.880]
Violent radio.

[01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:00.940]
And any other station that I've ever worked, and it's a tribute to the yacht.

[01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:05.000]
See, we're actually on a station that is an audience now, which, you know, we haven't been

[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:05.540]
in a long time.

[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.120]
An audience beside our show.

[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:08.220]
I know we're not used to it at all.

[01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:09.500]
You know, I'll say that the rest of the day.

[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:12.700]
And of course, remember when we were on Wednesday, there were certain shows that didn't raise

[01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:15.260]
a dime, not to mention any names.

[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.020]
But, um, oh, this is fantastic.

[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:19.900]
And we thank everybody profusely.

[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:20.940]
It's a tremendous cause.

[01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:25.020]
And I think I also want to thank Sonny Fox a lot, because we joke about Sonny.

[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:29.800]
But the day that he came in and gave the grand, and I matched it, I think that motivated a lot

[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:30.480]
of people out there.

[01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:32.880]
They figure, well, if these guys are going to give that kind of money, we can certainly

[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.620]
give 20 or 30 or 50 or whatever.

[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.300]
And we appreciate that.

[01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:38.460]
And of course, the cassette tapes is helping a lot too.

[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:41.780]
And by the way, when you send your request for the bone in a box, if you want to throw

[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:45.600]
a check in there for Camilo's house, don't, you know, don't be afraid to do that, right?

[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:46.740]
It's well worth it.

[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:47.220]
It sure is.

[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:48.880]
1213 to WIOD.

[01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:50.620]
And let me tell you about char-hud right now.

[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:52.720]
Probably a lot of people thinking about lunch, yes.

[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:53.780]
Right as we speak.

[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:54.640]
But I think about it.

[01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:56.260]
Zip over to the char-hud nearest you.

[01:30:56.740 --> 01:31:02.480]
You'll find them in your super-hosed station just in time for the holiday.

[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:08.460]
Here, now, back to Neil Rogers, our news talk radio 610, WIOD.

[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:12.380]
You know, the amazing thing about Renere show this morning, we were commenting on it, up

[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:15.680]
until the end there, where there was some ticking in a phone line.

[01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:16.040]
What are that?

[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:18.160]
But the quality of it was so fantastic.

[01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:19.720]
It was like, it was coming right from the building.

[01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:20.500]
I know.

[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:21.620]
Was it that amazing?

[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:22.580]
At least in town.

[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:24.600]
And you couldn't even hear the slots going in the back.

[01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:27.060]
They did it very subtly and very quietly.

[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:30.180]
But I know Roger was plunging his brains out while the show was going on.

[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:31.340]
Sunrise, hello.

[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:32.340]
Good morning, Neil.

[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:32.980]
Good morning, Doc.

[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.080]
And a good morning to you, sir.

[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:35.380]
I made a good news, be yours.

[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.300]
Okay, terrific.

[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.780]
Listen, Neil, my cousin is a restaurant.

[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:40.720]
Well, good luck to him, sir.

[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.320]
I hope he has a very prosperous life.

[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:46.140]
By the way, I mentioned before the exciting thing in Margate, the last excitement was the

[01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:47.740]
bris of Isadora Shapiro.

[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.800]
And probably a lot of people are...

[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:50.280]
Well, a lot of people...

[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:51.360]
I'm here, sir, just relax.

[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:54.620]
A lot of people are wondering why that would be exciting, because there are probably a

[01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:55.600]
lot of bris in Margate.

[01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:56.800]
But Isadora is 47.

[01:31:58.200 --> 01:31:59.080]
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:00.000]
Hello?

[01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:01.380]
Neil, so...

[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:04.320]
I know you're upset because I'm talking over you now, not paying any attention to what

[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:04.680]
you're saying.

[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:08.520]
But I thought the comment about Isadora was a hell of a lot more exciting than what you

[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.240]
said so far.

[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:09.920]
Okay.

[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:12.580]
Now, what you've got to say, yes, that could be really thrilling.

[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:13.980]
I doubt it, but it's going to be great.

[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:16.560]
Okay, it's Joe Geos in Miramar.

[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:17.540]
Joe Geos?

[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:17.860]
Yeah.

[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.020]
Is that like perfume?

[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:20.680]
No, it's a restaurant.

[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:21.340]
Okay.

[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:21.940]
Okay.

[01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:24.920]
We are inviting you to come down and try the food.

[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:26.680]
Well, you know I'm on a diet, so I can't do that.

[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:29.580]
No, but we have salads there, but if you can't, how about Glyn?

[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:31.740]
Now he lives in Nakhindal.

[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:32.660]
Yeah, Miramar...

[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:33.240]
How big is Gasklin?

[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:34.960]
Uh, Miramar, it's not...

[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:35.320]
Like, you know...

[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:37.220]
Well, I already know the answer, because he's not going to go there.

[01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:38.280]
No, not to Miramar.

[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:38.660]
No.

[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.460]
But I mean, after the diet is over, okay?

[01:32:40.460 --> 01:32:42.320]
What if we come down and pick up with a limousine?

[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:42.600]
No.

[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:43.760]
After the diet.

[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.220]
I'm not going to go off the diet for anybody, okay?

[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:46.860]
Okay.

[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:48.400]
But how come after the...

[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:48.900]
How about...

[01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:49.400]
After my diet?

[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:52.140]
How about after the diet's over if you bring us lunch one day?

[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.140]
Yeah, you bring it here.

[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:54.040]
How about that?

[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:55.060]
Was that a good compromise?

[01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:55.840]
Never a lot easier?

[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:56.400]
Yeah.

[01:32:56.760 --> 01:33:00.400]
In fact, you could bring us lunch soon, one day next week, and Glyn will eat it.

[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:00.900]
Okay.

[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:01.320]
Glyn will eat it.

[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:01.320]

[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:01.320]

[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:02.140]
Glyn will eat it.

[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:02.540]
Glyn will eat it.

[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:02.540]

[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:02.540]

[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:02.960]
Glyn will eat it.

[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:02.960]

[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:03.420]
Glyn will eat it.

[01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:03.780]
Okay.

[01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:04.140]
Definitely.

[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:07.380]
Yeah, forget about that cool.

[01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:09.360]
Yeah, it's probably your cousin who owns the restaurant.

[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:10.220]
Probably.

[01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:10.460]

[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:13.920]
Could be Johnny Depp, I know it's Miramar.

[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:15.900]
Neil, my check is out there to the community.

[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:16.520]
Thank you.

[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:16.940]
Thank you.

[01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:18.560]
Okay, appreciate it.

[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:18.940]
Okay.

[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:19.760]
Have a good life.

[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:20.440]
You too, buddy.

[01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:20.760]
Bye.

[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:22.640]
1218 at WIOD.

[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:23.840]
There's an open line in Broward.

[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:26.160]
If you move very quickly now, this is that part of the show in the line.

[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:26.820]
Just go nuts.

[01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:30.320]
And if you believe that, you really are stupid, okay?

[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:31.740]
Where are we going?

[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:33.100]
Bob in Jupiter.

[01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:34.000]
How you doing, Bob?

[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:36.400]
Oh, well, Bob too.

[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:37.860]
It's Bob.

[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:38.760]
It's about felting.

[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:40.260]
It is Bob.

[01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:40.640]
Yeah.

[01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:42.580]
Put you up a little, Bob.

[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:42.980]
Will you please?

[01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:44.460]
That was good.

[01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:46.200]
Yeah, okay.

[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:47.660]
You've been up there in Jupiter too long.

[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:48.840]
I mean, you better come back to Earth.

[01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:52.820]
I don't know if Bob is calling from Jupiter or Uranus right next door.

[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:54.980]
What's up, Bob?

[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:56.480]
I got it.

[01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:57.680]
Speak to us.

[01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:02.040]
I think Bob must have cut a little of the leaf hour show today because he's just in a panic.

[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:03.080]
He's in a cold sweat.

[01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:06.400]
Bob, calm down, Bob.

[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:08.060]
Get a hold of yourself.

[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:10.800]
I've sounds like Bob already has a hold of himself.

[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.260]
I think that's the problem, doesn't it?

[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:14.200]
Okay.

[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:16.020]
Wow.

[01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:17.840]
Ed, talk about a mouth breather.

[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:18.400]
There you go.

[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:19.040]
That was great.

[01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:21.660]
That was the definitive radio mouth breather right there.

[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:23.120]
God.

[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:24.260]
Almighty.

[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:25.900]
You all hear calls like that a little bit.

[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:27.740]
I think I'm ready to do a separate religion at this point.

[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:29.960]
You all hear calls like that on the Bob Lanceter Show.

[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:32.280]
Oh.

[01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:35.580]
The Bob Lanceter Show.

[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:37.460]
Boy, talk about ponderous.

[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:43.040]
Sometimes I wonder what Casey is talking about when he's saying it's getting leaping ponderous.

[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.380]
He must be talking about the Bob Lanceter Show.

[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:48.460]
Because I can't think of anything more ponderous than Lanceter.

[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:50.040]
I mean ponderous.

[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:52.540]
I couldn't believe you didn't bring him over here when he came over here.

[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:53.620]
You know, a griable Bob.

[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:55.420]
I always shut the cart.

[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:55.680]

[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:55.820]
Yeah.

[01:34:56.100 --> 01:35:00.680]
There's a lot of stuff I left behind, but I figured they got only knows they need some material over there.

[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:05.180]
I wouldn't you know out of all the ACN stuff, the only stuff that they play is the personal.

[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:06.560]
Is the stuff that we never played?

[01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:08.560]
Because it was so embarrassingly bad.

[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:08.980]
Yeah.

[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:13.400]
Now there's only one other person that I know of who ever played that stuff every day.

[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:14.480]
Every day.

[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:16.160]
And your stand is listening right now to stand.

[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:17.600]
You know that it was bad stuff.

[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:17.940]
Okay.

[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:19.420]
More stand play.

[01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:20.160]
The good stuff too.

[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:20.720]
Don't get me wrong.

[01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:23.480]
But he played those personal are just awful.

[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:24.260]
They're embarrassing.

[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:24.820]
Yeah.

[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:27.660]
But I guess it fits on that show over there now, you know.

[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:31.900]
Because I keep hearing more stories from that building from Carroll City.

[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:32.240]
Really?

[01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:33.840]
You've heard tales of the Vienna Woods.

[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:35.400]
This is tales of Carroll City.

[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:36.820]
Oh, about how they've turned it around.

[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:38.100]
Yeah, they've turned it around.

[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:41.820]
In fact, a lot of them are turned upside down at this point, lying on the floor, making moaning

[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:42.820]
sounds, whimpering.

[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:43.540]
But they got it.

[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:44.280]
Now they got it to go.

[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:45.060]
They got it, all right.

[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:48.180]
It's called an empty log is what they got.

[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:51.760]
And as they blink and say, there's nothing worse than an empty log.

[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:52.240]
Oh.

[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:54.320]
Here's Larry with an apology in Kendall.

[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:54.840]
Neil.

[01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:55.800]
What did you do, Larry?

[01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:58.460]
I didn't listen to yesterday at all.

[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:00.200]
Well, I do ought to be sorry, Larry.

[01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:02.120]
You ought to really hang your head in shame.

[01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:02.740]
I do.

[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:07.060]
And this morning, I didn't listen all the way until 11.45.

[01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:10.700]
What were you doing yesterday that was so stinkin' important that you couldn't listen to the show?

[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:14.480]
Well, I was listening to your sister's station trying to get all the grateful dead tunes.

[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:15.500]
Oh, yeah.

[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:17.460]
Yeah, it must have been dead Thursday over there.

[01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:17.680]
It was.

[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:20.660]
That's the only reason why I listened to them.

[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:22.620]
Otherwise, I was listening to you from tenor.

[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:24.620]
The rumor has it that it's dead every day.

[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.000]
No, no, no.

[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:27.040]
I like her, I'm being.

[01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:28.340]
I told you that once before.

[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:28.740]
Yeah.

[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.220]
So what's wrong with that?

[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:31.300]
They're right over here next door.

[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:32.700]
Yeah, they love them now.

[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:33.160]
Good.

[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:35.480]
Yeah, and they love us from a distance.

[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:38.260]
Yeah, this morning though, I forgot to listen to you.

[01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:39.480]
I felt bad about that.

[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:42.080]
Well, you do listen apology, you're right, Larry.

[01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:45.500]
Hey, but listen, Neil, where are you from in New York and upstate New York?

[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:46.720]
Hey, here we go.

[01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:48.560]
No, I knew Larry was a good call.

[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:51.060]
How about watch us during Canada, where are you?

[01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:51.700]
I'm from Oswego.

[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:52.620]
Oswego!

[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:54.220]
Hey, now you're talking.

[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:55.320]
We're out of time.

[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:56.320]
He's right down the road.

[01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.460]
This segment's going to have to be.

[01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:00.060]
And we're going to talk about Auburn, New York.

[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.300]
And Syracuse and Udeke.

[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:02.440]

[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:03.380]
And yeah?

[01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:04.580]
Yeah, and Geneva.

[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:06.320]
I can't believe I moved down here.

[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:07.540]
I should have went to Oswego today.

[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.900]
And Fairport and Penaan and Binghamton and Fredonia and Duncurt.

[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:12.540]
And maybe Jimmy Dunnig, it'll call back.

[01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:15.280]
Jimmy used to be the president of Buffalo Raceway and Hamburg.

[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:15.820]
Definitely.

[01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:16.520]
Exactly.

[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:19.560]
We can talk about the Max Robinson who used to call races up there.

[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:20.060]
Uh-huh.

[01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:22.260]
And Stan Verin, who used to do the racing show?

[01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:24.040]
Well, did you ever go to the Oswego Speedway?

[01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:25.140]
Oh, all the time.

[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:25.620]
Are races?

[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:25.880]
No.

[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:27.900]
Neither did I.

[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:28.980]
How about them?

[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:29.700]
Wait a minute.

[01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:30.400]
What's the other place?

[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:31.940]
Isn't it, uh, there's Clifton Springs?

[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:34.580]
What's that town up there where they have the big auto races?

[01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:35.980]
A swiggo.

[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:37.460]
No, not a swiggo.

[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:38.320]
Come on, seriously.

[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:39.440]
I don't know if the other one is there.

[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:40.700]
I can't think of any other one.

[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:41.540]
Is it Clifton Springs?

[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:42.660]
I don't know.

[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.500]
That's where they have the sulfur springs.

[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:46.660]
But I think they also have car racing up there or something.

[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.380]
Somebody will call in and we'll get a whole...

[01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:48.820]
What's the dirt track?

[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:52.820]
We'll get a whole discussion started about this and get some butt-looking duck hysterical.

[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:53.200]
Okay?

[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:57.240]
This will pay him back for that gigantic 10-course lunchy in front of my face.

[01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:00.620]
Neil, where are you living in Perave?

[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.000]
Not in the O, but Glenn.

[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:03.100]
Where are you living in Kendall now?

[01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:04.500]
Yeah, give me the exact address.

[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:05.620]
Exactly.

[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:06.780]
I live in South Miami.

[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:07.760]
Yeah, I live in South Miami.

[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:07.840]

[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:09.360]
Not too far from the Palmetto.

[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:13.260]
Oh, I live in Rosland off of 150 second Avenue and sunset.

[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:13.820]
Uh-huh.

[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:15.800]
Well, let's reminisce about South Miami now.

[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:17.220]
Yeah, this ought to take a long time.

[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:19.600]
Do you remember Godfather's on sunset?

[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:23.240]
I used to love Godfather's.

[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:24.520]
I really needed to.

[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:25.320]
I loved it.

[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:27.080]
It had gone long gone, but man, it was great.

[01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:30.780]
And Javier from Godfather's, I wish Javier would call in one day.

[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.040]
In fact, I wish Javier would come in one day.

[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.420]
Boy, trust me.

[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.280]
Listen, Larry, you've been a great caller.

[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:38.820]
You're shocked to hell out of me, you know what I'm saying?

[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.940]
Yeah, well one more thing in closing though.

[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:42.740]
This is the most I got from you since the station.

[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:43.920]
I want you to be in the middle of the night.

[01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:45.320]
I think that'll make your day.

[01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:46.360]
All right?

[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:46.780]
Yeah.

[01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:47.360]
Okay.

[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:48.820]
You fly a meeting dog.

[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:50.200]
You're coming to fucking pig.

[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:51.180]
Excellent.

[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:53.200]
I have a very...

[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:53.340]
Bye.

[01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:53.460]
Bye.

[01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:54.380]
Oh, it's nice.

[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:55.580]
He was excellent, wasn't he?

[01:38:55.660 --> 01:38:56.380]
I can't think that.

[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.400]
I don't know about excellently.

[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:00.300]
He sounded excellent to me, but of course voices are sometimes deceiving.

[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:00.760]
Okay.

[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:02.680]
It's a 24-pass new to WIOD.

[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:08.240]
We want to thank our good friends over at Rick's Esendelli in North Miami Beach for they brought to town.

[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:09.560]
W-I-O-D.

[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:10.780]
Good morning, Americans.

[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:12.800]
It's Friday.

[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:16.460]
You know, the new hour comes and you just have to get a little taste of that, don't you?

[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:17.020]
Of course.

[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:20.520]
By the way, the town, and we thank whoever called in Watkins Glen, New York.

[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:23.200]
I always get clifton springs in Watkins Glen confused.

[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:24.740]
I don't know why.

[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:25.220]
I don't either.

[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:26.300]
Because they sound so much alike.

[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:30.380]
Anyway, Watkins Glen is where they have the auto racing in upstate New York.

[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:31.020]
I'm glad you...

[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:34.020]
Somebody also said English town raceway in New Jersey.

[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.520]
What the hell do we care about New Jersey?

[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:38.060]
We got enough problems without Jersey.

[01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:39.620]
Okay, we got people going to Newark.

[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:41.540]
We got English town raceway.

[01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:42.920]
We don't care about New Jersey.

[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:43.880]
We're trying to forget it.

[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:44.740]
Right?

[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.820]
Well, this time of year, we got a mobile in Broward.

[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:48.060]
Hello.

[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:49.760]
Long gone.

[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:51.380]
Okay, how about Deerfield?

[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:51.960]
Hello.

[01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:52.920]
Yes, sir.

[01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:55.060]
I like to ask you a opinion on something.

[01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:55.280]
Yeah.

[01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:57.300]
What's your opinion on David Letterman?

[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:01.720]
I watch him now and then to be honest with you.

[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:03.260]
But I'm not that much into him.

[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:04.960]
I don't see what people get so crazy about.

[01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:07.520]
Letterman is a yuppie kind of thing.

[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:09.900]
In other words, it's in to watch Letterman.

[01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:12.240]
But I don't know.

[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:15.040]
There's a lot of stuff under that just doesn't make it, you know?

[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:18.020]
Yeah, you too rely on like cutting down people.

[01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:20.460]
Yeah, like I said, there's a lot on that show that really is great.

[01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:21.100]
Yeah.

[01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:23.320]
I'm a Letterman freak.

[01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:25.280]
Yeah, but now you got to admit it.

[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:26.380]
The show is...

[01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:27.620]
It's ponderous, man.

[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:28.660]
No, it's not ponderous.

[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:31.580]
And that Paul Schaefer, God, he's got to put you up a little bit, you know?

[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:33.380]
Paul Schaefer in the band.

[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:35.200]
Yeah, he got to put you up just a hair.

[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:37.420]
Or at least get some hair, one or the other.

[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:39.460]
Now Letterman's okay.

[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:40.280]
He's got his moment.

[01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:40.640]
Yeah.

[01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:42.640]
What do you think about that show called Dr. Hube?

[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:43.860]
Hmm.

[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:45.480]
Dr. Hube, I don't watch that.

[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:46.120]
I don't get that.

[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:48.100]
I don't watch that much like regular TV.

[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:49.440]
I watch irregular TV.

[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:53.840]
In fact, I'm going to get my satellite dish put back up because I'm missing too much good stuff.

[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:54.280]
Yeah.

[01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:58.400]
Well, I agree about these scum, second blue hair bitches.

[01:40:58.840 --> 01:40:59.020]
Yeah.

[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:00.920]
They can get out of here, man.

[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:03.920]
Yeah, we're going to get a fleet of buses and we're going to ship them all out.

[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:04.300]
You're right.

[01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:06.440]
And why on a bus, you can sit.

[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:07.860]
Excellent. Well, read it from you, Paul.

[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:11.440]
Even if it takes a million trips, man, if we can get every last one of the nasty,

[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:14.100]
I mean, there's some older people who are very nice like my mother.

[01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:15.680]
And about three or four other people.

[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:17.240]
No, no, there are, you know, a lot of them.

[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:17.440]
Yeah.

[01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:20.960]
That's maybe 20, 30% of people who are with it in our judgemental and our bitter.

[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:33.160]
But man, we got a whole bunch, thousands and thousands and thousands of nasty, miserable, rotten, horrendous, barbaric, subhuman, old douchebags who want everybody to be miserable.

[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:34.520]
They don't want anybody to have a good time.

[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:35.640]
They don't want any young people.

[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:35.940]
I don't know.

[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:38.640]
They just want this to be like their own thing here.

[01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:39.640]
Like they own it.

[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:41.040]
I just live in Deer Creek, man.

[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:43.180]
And they thought I was a cat when we moved in.

[01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:46.980]
And then they found out when I was a teenager, man, they threw us out.

[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:47.980]
Yeah, and that great.

[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:49.680]
There's a bunch of old parts.

[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:50.380]
You got it.

[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:54.160]
You know, you can do something today, sir, that'll really upset them if you want to.

[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:55.240]
What, egg their houses?

[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:56.320]
No, you can laugh.

[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:58.240]
Yeah, he already laughed a couple of times.

[01:41:58.240 --> 01:41:59.120]
That really gets a day.

[01:41:59.220 --> 01:42:01.460]
That's why they hate the bird, man, because he laughs and laughs.

[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:03.620]
The son of laughter makes them hysterical.

[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:06.460]
They can't stand it because then they think somebody's having a good time.

[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:06.720]
Yeah.

[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:12.720]
You know, of all the tapes I've heard of Howard Stern and Robin Quiver sits there and laughs for four hours.

[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:12.960]
Yeah.

[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:16.540]
I've never heard one caller call up Howard and complain about Robin.

[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:18.440]
That's why this show is a lot better than Howard's.

[01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:21.380]
And they call up every day and complain about me here.

[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:21.740]
That's right.

[01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:22.720]
And that's part of the idea.

[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:23.440]
I love it.

[01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:24.840]
Listen, you have a good way.

[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:26.760]
Don't let those old prunes are getting your ways here.

[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:27.380]
Yeah, I know.

[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:28.320]
Just run them right over.

[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:29.800]
I am a great deal, man.

[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:30.480]
I'm very Christmas.

[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:31.380]
Okay, same to you.

[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:31.600]
Bye.

[01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:38.340]
I see there was a great caller, not a good call, but a great call, because he's, he's not going to let him screw up his life.

[01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:40.440]
He's going to say, up yours.

[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:42.960]
You know what I mean?

[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:47.440]
Like, take the old animal bag and have a wonderful time with it, lady, but just to get out of my life.

[01:42:47.780 --> 01:42:48.320]
Drop dead.

[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:49.180]
Exactly.

[01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:52.460]
I couldn't have put a better myself, like that kid I called from the pay phone.

[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:53.240]
Drop dead.

[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:54.740]
Yeah, if you don't like it, drop dead.

[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:56.460]
Take a hike.

[01:42:57.100 --> 01:42:58.300]
Get out of our lives already.

[01:42:58.840 --> 01:42:59.460]
Leave us alone.

[01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:05.820]
Man, can you imagine what it would be like if just if nobody ever liked Steve does these shows he did to this week and I commend him for it.

[01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:09.160]
The one with the animals on Monday and I do mean animals.

[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:16.140]
And then the one yesterday about the kind of nine year old girl and her aunt and uncle or whatever.

[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:17.840]
I guess to her step parents now.

[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:18.620]
But I got to meet her.

[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:19.340]
Did you get to meet her?

[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:20.200]
No, very nice.

[01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:21.420]
Yeah, very quiet.

[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:23.960]
I mean, she was as quiet as a church mug.

[01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:24.940]
She's nine years old.

[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:31.220]
It's not like she's a little baby who's crying and screaming or like, you know, a teenager with a loud car or motorcycle.

[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:32.780]
Not that all teenagers are loud.

[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:39.040]
But I mean, she's just a very, very quiet, nice little girl and right away they got to make a big to do it.

[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:40.060]
Oh, it's such a bad precedent.

[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:43.200]
And all these yentas in there got to get involved.

[01:43:43.340 --> 01:43:44.100]
And they ought to be ashamed.

[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:46.420]
Seriously, they ought to be humiliated and ashamed.

[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:49.500]
And then they're calling up and threatening.

[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:51.460]
You know, did you hear that part of the show where they're threatening?

[01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:52.420]
They're going to call their lawyers.

[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:55.240]
They're going to go after Steve and out of hell with them.

[01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:56.540]
Unbelievable.

[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:00.280]
Well, here's the source for white castle burgers.

[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:01.380]
Again?

[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:03.440]
I thought we already got this screened out.

[01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:04.460]
Well, let's check it out again.

[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:04.760]
Hello.

[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:05.640]
Hello, Neil.

[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:08.500]
You were at the bottom of the list, but it looked so interesting that...

[01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:12.220]
Well, I'm the old cup fan caller from Waterhale, you call you on...

[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:12.660]
Oh, yeah.

[01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:17.560]
Yeah, I'm getting my satellite dish put up because I know that continental cable will never give us WGN.

[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:19.560]
So I'm going to put my dish back up.

[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:21.320]
You know what they told me when I called them up?

[01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:21.740]
Yeah.

[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:25.940]
They said, well, if we get enough people to call and write in, then maybe we'll get it.

[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:26.640]
Yeah, right.

[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:29.520]
And maybe Hanukkah will come in July too, right?

[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:29.880]
Exactly.

[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:31.860]
Anyway, I was up in Lantan.

[01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:32.720]
I worked during the day.

[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:34.240]
I took off half a day today.

[01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:39.240]
And I'm up in Lantan up between Hyper Luxaro and Lantanaro and down on US-1 and their Dixie Highway.

[01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:39.940]
The combination.

[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:43.360]
There's a place called the Lunch Stop and they serve white castle burgers.

[01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:48.180]
They've got the little square hamburgers with the little square buns with the onions and the mustard and the ketchup.

[01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:49.720]
Just like you get it up north.

[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:51.760]
Yeah, but they're not white castle though.

[01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:54.180]
They're not white castle, but they're the same identical thing.

[01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:59.500]
Yeah, because we got castle burger too, which is supposed to be like an offshoot of royal castle burgers.

[01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:00.160]
Right.

[01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:05.920]
And the only problem with castle burger is that they make them way ahead of time and they put them in those steamers.

[01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:06.260]
Right.

[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:09.680]
And by the time you get them, man, I'll tell you they're like mung.

[01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:11.740]
Oh, well, if you make them to order, then they're probably pretty good.

[01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:13.040]
They're about 39 cents a piece.

[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:13.660]
Excellent.

[01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:14.580]
Perfect.

[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:16.580]
So if you ever get up that way by Lantanaro.

[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:23.480]
And don't forget, you can also go in a supermarket in the Freezure department in most markets and they've got the real, the real honest to God white castle frozen,

[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:25.500]
the plain burgers and little cheeseburgers.

[01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:26.720]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:28.500]
And then you get the grease out from them, right?

[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:28.880]
Yeah.

[01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:32.340]
Yeah, the grease just comes pouring on them and then you know they're for real.

[01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:32.780]
Yeah.

[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:38.740]
I tried to listen to the Zeta Morning Show after you left a little bit just to see what the food was going on.

[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:39.120]
Yeah.

[01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:40.260]
And I just can't.

[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:43.280]
Now I listen to, you know, you got me hooked on EM and I listen to Mike.

[01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:43.740]
Good.

[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:44.540]
Great.

[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:49.000]
And I don't even, as a matter of fact, I took Zeta off my FM.

[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:50.240]
Me too, sir.

[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:51.580]
I did too.

[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:56.440]
I just, you know, the way the handle it for you guys did here.

[01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:58.360]
Yeah, and you know, they were really stupid to do that.

[01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:01.040]
If they would have, I tried to do it like a gentleman.

[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:06.100]
You try to leave under good, you know, and not say anything and just do as good a job as we could until we were going to leave.

[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:08.040]
But they couldn't leave well enough alone.

[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:16.900]
And right away, they're, you know, the Tim douche bag, and open up his big mouth to the herald and put it out and all these statements about how, you know, we couldn't turn over the audience to the rest of the allist crap.

[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:23.580]
And so, you know, they really ticked me off and as a result, they created a lot of bad feeling and they changed the way most of the audience they had before.

[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:27.160]
I used to have it set up my station and when you left, now I've got you.

[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:29.880]
Yeah, I'm going to take the button off all my radio's too.

[01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:32.860]
There is some of the music they play I like, but it's not worth it, you know.

[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.440]
I've got my cassette now and I want your old stuff that's what I play.

[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:36.880]
Exactly.

[01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:38.760]
Okay, listen, great hearing from you.

[01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:39.640]
Okay, Neil, bye.

[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:40.280]
Have a good one.

[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:46.300]
Okay, yeah, I'm going to take, that's going to be my homework assignment for the audience today is to take Zeta off your button on your car radio.

[01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:46.960]
Feels good.

[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:48.680]
It does. It's a great feeling, man.

[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:49.660]
It's like euphoric.

[01:46:49.660 --> 01:46:54.780]
Prove 34 April's got a news update and we'll come right back on 610 W I O D.

[01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:58.700]
A new stock radio 610 W I O D.

[01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:03.460]
I always want sex in the morning, sex in the morning.

[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:10.640]
When I'm not my best, want, expect in the morning, catching and falling,

[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:20.980]
tearing at my breath, want, someone who's wind, someone to skin, someone to underpins,

[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:28.220]
want, someone to fall on, someone to crawl on, someone to have a win,

[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:36.140]
sex in the morning, sex in the morning, covers that my knees want,

[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:44.960]
rotten condition, active position, I am a trapeze, someone who's sleepy,

[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:52.560]
someone who's keeping nothing into a cage, want somebody first hand,

[01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:57.320]
someone to first and then go back to sleep.

[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:05.320]
There is nothing I like better than a jostle now and then,

[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:12.640]
with the hands under the sweater and the back that starts to bend,

[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:19.640]
but before my eyes are open, I don't want to have too high,

[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:27.720]
from a simple gun still poking with a thimbleful of pride.

[01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:36.660]
Boys want sex in the morning, sex in the morning,

[01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:43.880]
soiling the sheep, sex while I'm yawning, suddenly spawning,

[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:49.220]
when I'm half a fleet, want, someone unconscious,

[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:56.280]
somebody not just waiting for a thirill is one, sex with surprises,

[01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:00.900]
sex with some rises, someone on the pill,

[01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:09.820]
there is nothing like a lover who can satisfy your needs,

[01:49:09.820 --> 01:49:16.300]
and the joy when you discover just how often he's succeeds,

[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:23.540]
but before my eyes can focus, I don't need him to surprise,

[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:31.380]
by descending like the locust on a field of sleeping fog.

[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:39.780]
Boys want sex in the morning, sex in the morning,

[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:45.460]
when I'm still not fresh, want, something that strikes them,

[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:50.040]
someone who likes them, on the wing their flesh,

[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:57.340]
someone to take them, someone to break, and comment on their slides,

[01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:06.480]
someone to prod and someone who not, and then just close her eyes.

[01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:11.980]
Good day.

[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:16.340]
Okay, 1241 at WIOD, now I put the mic cozy on here.

[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:18.520]
Is this one Steve uses?

[01:50:19.500 --> 01:50:20.020]
The cozy?

[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.020]
That's what Craig would call us, the cozy.

[01:50:22.020 --> 01:50:22.220]
Yeah.

[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:25.580]
As in a toilet tissue, that's her anyway.

[01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:27.860]
You think that most people know what a toilet tissue cozy is?

[01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:29.700]
I don't think even Mr. Whipple knows what that is.

[01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:33.640]
But when we were at the old KAT, Craig had these old ladies who would knit them.

[01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:35.400]
That Craig.

[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:38.260]
These little holders that you put around toilet paper.

[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.480]
And we had this big piano in this giant ancient studio over at the cat,

[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.060]
and on top of the piano we had all these toilet tissue cozy,

[01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:49.360]
man, is incredible.

[01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:53.460]
Probably the only station in America that had toilet tissue cozy in the studio.

[01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:54.800]
Well, that shit is holding something.

[01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:59.060]
And since they were full of it over there, probably maybe to see Miami Beach.

[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:00.480]
Hello, Neil.

[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:01.100]
Yes, sir.

[01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:04.400]
I think you guys are doing a great job with a whole Camilla South.

[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:06.540]
It's just wonderful what you guys are doing.

[01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:09.000]
Well, the audience is doing a great job. They are really responding.

[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:11.420]
I've never seen anything like this. Not even close.

[01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:15.760]
You can take a page out of some of these telephones,

[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:19.780]
get a nice fan favorite thing, before you give a tally or toad or whatever.

[01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:20.340]
Okay.

[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:21.160]
Or like Jared.

[01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:24.640]
Yeah, well, when Roger comes back on Monday, he knows where all those cards are.

[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.440]
Toronto's fan fan, all that.

[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:27.800]
Yeah.

[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:29.880]
Yeah, make the audience feel a little better.

[01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:31.060]
Or not, as a case, maybe.

[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:31.240]

[01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:33.740]
I ran into Hickabuch for a day.

[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:35.460]
How did it come out?

[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:38.140]
He's got connections in this town.

[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:38.940]
Yeah, I bet he does.

[01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:41.040]
But I think they should take a lesson from the Russians.

[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:41.920]
Upwind, man.

[01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:42.700]
There they go now.

[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:43.780]
We're coming to get you, sir.

[01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:44.300]
Very good.

[01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:46.760]
The geriatric police are coming to get you now.

[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:47.900]
The geratol police.

[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:50.440]
I think they take a lesson from the Russians.

[01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:52.100]
Just bulldozer, all the condos.

[01:51:52.340 --> 01:51:53.280]
They'll like the disease spread.

[01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:55.020]
Oh, that is starting next week, by the way.

[01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:58.420]
A week from Wednesday, they're going to start bulldozing every condo in South Florida.

[01:51:58.620 --> 01:51:59.520]
I don't want to scare anybody.

[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:01.280]
Well, what about disease spread around?

[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:01.780]
Yeah.

[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:05.160]
Crawler did his 88 update show today.

[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:09.800]
And he showed excerpts from the one with the big chair incident.

[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:10.520]
Oh, yeah.

[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:14.500]
And he said there's been a lot of indictments since his show was on.

[01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:17.500]
And he said, I only have one nose to give to my country.

[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:19.700]
I read a big article about that the other day.

[01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:20.500]
The whole thing was contrived.

[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:22.100]
The whole thing was set up.

[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:22.720]
It was fake.

[01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:25.280]
And the broken nose was only by accident.

[01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:27.820]
And he milked it for everything he could get out of it.

[01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:29.840]
But they say what goes around comes around.

[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:31.180]
That's what they say.

[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:33.200]
Hey, bird.

[01:52:33.620 --> 01:52:34.060]
Yes, sir.

[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:36.640]
I think you don't listen to what anybody says.

[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:38.540]
You're not about licking lame doc.

[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:40.860]
And you're not Ed McMahon.

[01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:42.220]
You're better than ours or treacher.

[01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:44.600]
Boy, now there's a statement.

[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:47.760]
Well, you got to consider this source.

[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:50.860]
Although our fish and chips were hell of a lot better than the birds, you got to admit.

[01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:51.540]
Yeah.

[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:52.040]
Yeah.

[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:55.040]
Or anyway, you guys are doing a great job on our leather show.

[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:55.720]
Thanks a lot.

[01:52:55.860 --> 01:52:56.280]
All right, Neil.

[01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:56.640]
Bye.

[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:57.440]
Brandie Friday.

[01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:58.200]
OK.

[01:52:58.560 --> 01:52:59.000]
All right.

[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:00.920]
1244, WIOD.

[01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:02.340]
I don't like this cozy, man.

[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:03.180]
This drives me nuts.

[01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:04.560]
Why did you put it on?

[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.160]
I don't know, because usually I like a little windscreen on a mic, but this is too big.

[01:53:09.380 --> 01:53:09.960]
You don't need it.

[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:12.160]
These are like a Jeff Stryker cozy.

[01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:13.440]
Good heavens.

[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:13.940]
Yeah.

[01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:15.720]
I'm going to take it off.

[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:17.780]
Yeah, I don't like it at all.

[01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:18.860]
Oh, excuse me.

[01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:19.720]
You don't need these.

[01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:23.560]
I don't have like a horrendous, gigantic, round, prophylactic.

[01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:25.660]
Pombi, chillo.

[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:26.360]
Neil.

[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:27.080]
Yes, sir.

[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:28.200]
How you doing, doodle?

[01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:30.620]
Don't call me noodles, sir.

[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:32.260]
That's a shot.

[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:33.000]
Yeah.

[01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:33.720]
Is that a shot?

[01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:34.080]
Yeah.

[01:53:34.780 --> 01:53:35.180]
Sorry.

[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:37.180]
Go ahead.

[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:40.300]
As they say, as they say a glove, sir, that was a low blow.

[01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:43.340]
It's a good time for that great case.

[01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:44.760]
That noodles, man.

[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:46.400]
He slays me.

[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:46.880]

[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:50.560]
I've got a friend in the office that is moving back to Boston.

[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:58.500]
And the best part about it is he's taken his gum back, mung brain, French Canadian, relatives

[01:53:58.500 --> 01:53:59.360]
with him.

[01:53:59.580 --> 01:54:00.100]
They're all turban.

[01:54:00.140 --> 01:54:00.540]
All right.

[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:01.400]
Extra.

[01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:03.260]
Take a few extras, too.

[01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:03.580]
Yeah.

[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:06.880]
I'm sure they're all related, you know, either directly or indirectly.

[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:08.900]
So take a few extras back for his panel.

[01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:09.060]
Yeah.

[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:13.200]
I'd like to just tell Dave, listen, you know, have a good time in your real douche bag.

[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:16.320]
Hey, how about those, the old cheapo breakfast club?

[01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:18.320]
Did you read about that in the paper?

[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:18.800]
No.

[01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:21.620]
Each of them, okay, there's five couples in one delontery.

[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:23.280]
Okay, they're all over 100.

[01:54:24.020 --> 01:54:26.700]
And they've, they've been eating at this restaurant for the last.

[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:28.820]
Oh, yeah, the 99 cent breakfast.

[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:30.040]
Yeah, that breakfast, right?

[01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:32.440]
They go in, they have a $10 tab every morning.

[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:35.520]
But this time, these are big spenders, Neil.

[01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:38.500]
They have a $12 tab, a $10 tab.

[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:40.760]
Wow, holy Toledo.

[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:43.920]
They probably make up for the dime that they've been leaving every other time.

[01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:44.440]
Hey, exactly.

[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:47.360]
So as far as that donation to the Camille South, you're minus the line.

[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:51.780]
Yeah, I'm waiting for the donation from those five couples that won the 28 million.

[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:52.580]
Wouldn't that be nice?

[01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:54.100]
That's what we're talking about.

[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:59.340]
Yeah, wouldn't it be nice to see like a $100,000 check or a $50,000 chair, even a grand come from those people?

[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:02.940]
I mean, I realized they're only getting about a million and a half a year.

[01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:04.620]
I mean, I know that's a poultry sum.

[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:08.540]
And divided by five, that's only 300,000 a couple, you know, so.

[01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:12.280]
It would be tough, but maybe they can squeeze their way through.

[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:13.140]
Okay, wouldn't that be nice?

[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:13.860]
Yeah, really.

[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:15.020]
Don't hold your breath.

[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:17.860]
They're all scumbags as far as I'm concerned.

[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:21.020]
Well, that's why the, that's another reason a lottery is a major ripoff.

[01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:26.340]
Not only do you have a chance in a hell of winning it, but the people who are winning it are either over the age of a hundred.

[01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:30.540]
Are these crotchety, miserable red necks who, you know, brown baggit.

[01:55:30.540 --> 01:55:33.640]
That's why a lot of the red necks went up like an O'Choppy and two egg,

[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:35.940]
because they hang out at the convenience store, man.

[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:40.300]
So they're buying lottery tickets all day in between brown bag lunches and pickle eggs.

[01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:41.860]
That's it. You're exactly right.

[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:44.660]
And they're all scumbags.

[01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:45.840]
Yeah, you got it.

[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:46.380]
Hey, Neil.

[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:46.800]
Yep.

[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:47.580]
Good day.

[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:48.080]
Okay.

[01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:50.080]
As they say in China.

[01:55:50.380 --> 01:55:50.680]
Red day?

[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:52.600]
Okay, 1247.

[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:55.960]
See, Paul Harvey may not be on this station anymore.

[01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:58.020]
And you notice the complaints are going in.

[01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:00.900]
I don't think they're getting any more calls about that at all.

[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:01.860]
Are they now now?

[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:03.780]
Yeah, most of those people died already.

[01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:06.900]
Most of the ones who used to say, good day.

[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:10.340]
But at least in the new now, we keep his mammary alive.

[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:10.800]

[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:15.220]
And listen, today it would be a great day to go out and not, you know, everybody's in the malls.

[01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:20.020]
Get some fresh air, get out in the wide open spaces, and stop by at Toyota of Hollywood.

[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:26.160]
And I do mean wide open spaces because they have acres and acres and acres of quality indeed.

[01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:47.900]
Well, I was driving down 95 the other night.

[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.220]
Somebody nearly cut me right off the road.

[01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:55.320]
I decided wasn't going to do any good to get mad.

[01:56:55.660 --> 01:56:57.820]
I wrote a song about him instead.

[01:56:58.680 --> 01:56:59.920]
And it goes like this.

[01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:04.600]
We're even on an asshole.

[01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:08.400]
Or did you work it in your whole life?

[01:57:10.300 --> 01:57:12.600]
Either way, it worked out fine.

[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:16.280]
Because you're an asshole tonight.

[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:20.560]
Yes, you're an A.

[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:21.900]
That's that thing.

[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:26.860]
So, Ellie, don't you try to blame it on me.

[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:30.600]
You deserve all the credit.

[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:34.400]
You're an asshole tonight.

[01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:40.940]
You're an asshole yesterday.

[01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:44.560]
You're an asshole tonight.

[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:53.080]
I've got a feeling you'll be an asshole the rest of your life.

[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:37.280]
I was talking to your mother just the other night.

[01:58:38.380 --> 01:58:41.460]
I told her I parked your an asshole.

[01:58:42.260 --> 01:58:45.180]
She said yes, I think you're right.

[01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:55.360]
And all your friends are asshole because you've known them your whole life.

[01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:03.480]
And somebody told me you've got an asshole for life.

[01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:13.740]
Or did you work it in your whole life?

[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:17.700]
Either way, it worked out fine.

[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:20.520]
Because you're an A.

[01:59:23.580 --> 01:59:27.020]
It's a good time for the great taste.

[01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:28.800]
Hold tonight.

[01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:32.940]
I see you like that.

[01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:34.120]
Is that noodle?

[01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:35.460]
Yeah, any something?

[01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:38.020]
You like that because you feel if the noodle fits where it is.

[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:42.860]
Anyway, 1254 at WIO, do you want to dedicate that to all the old prunes,

[01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:46.380]
all those miserable, nasty, subhuman old farts in South Florida,

[01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:49.860]
especially the ones in that complex up there in the Margate?

[01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:50.980]
Oh, good.

[01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:52.220]
That Steve was talking about yesterday.

[01:59:52.780 --> 01:59:55.640]
I can't remember the name of it, but it'll come back to us.

[01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:57.760]
Another Port St. Lucie call.

[01:59:57.880 --> 01:59:58.160]
Hello.

[01:59:58.320 --> 01:59:59.420]
Hi, Neil. How you doing?

[01:59:59.540 --> 01:59:59.900]
Okay.

[02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:01.700]
The first time call I enjoyed the show.

[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:02.460]
I'll be damned.

[02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:06.500]
Listen, I heard a show on Wednesday about the possibility of Alan coming in.

[02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:06.920]
Yeah.

[02:00:07.340 --> 02:00:08.220]
Glenn didn't like that.

[02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:11.120]
But, Glenn, I got an idea for you.

[02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:13.800]
If he brings Alan in, you should see if Jack can bring him in.

[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:14.840]
I can barely hear you.

[02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:15.380]
Pardon?

[02:00:15.740 --> 02:00:16.340]
Okay, go ahead.

[02:00:16.620 --> 02:00:21.340]
I'm saying if you bring Alan in, Neil, Glenn should see if Jack from Miami Beach

[02:00:21.340 --> 02:00:23.680]
who calls Sandy up and come in and counterbalance.

[02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:26.420]
Excellent suggestion, sir.

[02:00:26.420 --> 02:00:27.540]
Oh, excellent.

[02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:32.100]
I can see Glenn's point pretty much too.

[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:33.200]
Yeah, that sounds good to me.

[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:36.120]
Jack can sit on his lap and Alan has a sit on my lap, I said.

[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:37.940]
I do have an investment tip for you, Neil.

[02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:38.380]
Okay.

[02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:42.340]
We do not have any century villages up here in Stuart and Port St. Lucie.

[02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:45.260]
You may want to consider securing the territorial right.

[02:00:45.500 --> 02:00:46.880]
Oh, yeah. I'm talking to the people at Winmore.

[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:47.920]
Are you?

[02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:49.620]
See if we can not to build another one.

[02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:51.720]
Just ship the ones who are here already up to you guys.

[02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:55.480]
I think we're just shipping further north and relocating them in EHA junks.

[02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:57.180]
No, I think you know where it would be a perfect place.

[02:00:57.360 --> 02:00:57.600]
Where?

[02:00:58.240 --> 02:00:59.500]
St. Augustine.

[02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:01.060]
The oldest city.

[02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:02.140]
Isn't that the oldest city in America?

[02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:03.240]
Yeah, in America.

[02:01:03.500 --> 02:01:04.660]
Yeah, North America, I think.

[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:06.640]
And they can search for the fountain of youth all the time.

[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:07.240]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:08.220]
Exactly. Fantastic.

[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:10.140]
We'll even bring Posit Aleyon back to El Palo.

[02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:10.780]
Great.

[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:11.500]
Hey, one more thing.

[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:16.100]
Do you know of any stores I have some friends that are bald and have male pad and baldness?

[02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:19.600]
Do you know of any stores down there that sell those hats at Rick Shaw?

[02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:23.780]
Yeah. And I think Paul Schaefer is opening up his shop just for that.

[02:01:23.900 --> 02:01:24.920]
So we'll check it out for him.

[02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:26.920]
I like this hat's Rick wears that I want to give.

[02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:27.380]
Okay.

[02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:29.460]
Yeah, they're good for frying eggs under too.

[02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:30.640]
Okay, see you later.

[02:01:30.740 --> 02:01:31.380]
We're following up here.

[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:32.020]
Neo, keep it up.

[02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:32.540]
Thank you.

[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:34.620]
Oh, we're big in Port Saint-Lucy, man.

[02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:35.600]
He was so funny.

[02:01:35.740 --> 02:01:36.740]
We are a monster.

[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:39.360]
I'm like the Larry Kent of Port Saint-Lucy.

[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:41.860]
Pretty strong giant in our own time.

[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:43.120]
Pompo-no, hello.

[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:46.740]
I think you're going to like this call because it's going to be short and sweet.

[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:47.600]
And right to the point.

[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:49.120]
As opposed to long and wet.

[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:51.980]
I have an April-worthing fetish.

[02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:53.380]
Really? You too?

[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:55.600]
When she says W-I-O-D.

[02:01:55.660 --> 02:01:57.300]
Wait a minute. Why don't you get her name right?

[02:01:57.420 --> 02:01:58.280]
What did you say April, what?

[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:00.200]
Is it, is it worthing?

[02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:00.800]
Worth them.

[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:01.840]
No, it's Craig.

[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:03.400]
You say you have a Craig Worthy on a patch?

[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:03.700]

[02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:04.180]
April.

[02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:07.300]
When she says W-I-O-D depend on it.

[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:09.060]
I really do depend on it.

[02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:10.140]
Yeah. I bet you do.

[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:11.160]
It makes me feel good.

[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:11.980]
Talk about it, guys.

[02:02:11.980 --> 02:02:12.980]
Got a rich full life.

[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:13.980]
Listen, yeah.

[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:14.980]
It is the highlight of my day.

[02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:16.300]
So that tells you a little bit about life.

[02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:18.380]
You could be a fonding all over the Ross.

[02:02:18.660 --> 02:02:22.480]
Listen, I was a former Terminal E. Chronic Caller.

[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:24.640]
I went to the Neil Rogers School for the Terminal E. Chronic.

[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:26.000]
And I have called in five weeks.

[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:26.660]
You got the phone.

[02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:27.680]
I think I'm doing pretty well.

[02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:28.400]
That's fantastic.

[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:29.060]
It's impressive.

[02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:31.060]
Okay, and this is going to be short and sweet like I said.

[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:31.540]
Okay.

[02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:32.300]
I start today.

[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:34.100]
That was good.

[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:34.320]

[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:34.980]
There was.

[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:38.920]
So little April there is developing her own gigantic following up there.

[02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:40.480]
A little April-worth in the fan club.

[02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:42.860]
And, yeah?

[02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:43.520]
I don't know.

[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:44.400]
I wouldn't be kind of cute.

[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:47.060]
I don't want to spoil her news image because you know how news people are.

[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:50.540]
Well, wouldn't it be something if we had her put on some real like wet lipstick?

[02:02:51.100 --> 02:02:52.840]
And then we could take a little card.

[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:55.000]
They could make personalized little cards with a picture.

[02:02:55.260 --> 02:02:59.740]
And she could like imprint a lip print on the thing that she said it out and say,

[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:01.900]
made a good news be yours, something original like that.

[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:03.740]
Now I'm still to this day.

[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:05.840]
Now, what Lee Fowler says, made a good news be yours.

[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:09.900]
I'm still not allowed to go in and tickle her and absolutely not hug her.

[02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:12.700]
I told her if you get anywhere near her to smash you in the mouth, okay?

[02:03:12.700 --> 02:03:14.660]
I have seen the way you operate.

[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.600]
In fact, I remember that night at the melting pot done in Kendall with Sally.

[02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:22.000]
I wonder how come we haven't heard from Sally by the way.

[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:22.880]
You know, not all mighty.

[02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:24.560]
She's missing from our lives.

[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:29.120]
Sally is missing and it's just like she disappeared and of course we know why she isn't around.

[02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:32.060]
Why the hell have we heard from her?

[02:03:32.340 --> 02:03:32.660]
I know.

[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:33.700]
I haven't heard from her either.

[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:36.480]
Sally, because she listens, believe me.

[02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:37.020]
Absolutely.

[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:39.200]
And if she's not listening, the word will get back to her.

[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:40.760]
Well, she has my home phone number.

[02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:43.200]
As it's probably pretty.

[02:03:43.340 --> 02:03:44.500]
I think she's got mine too.

[02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:45.080]
It's probably pretty.

[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:45.500]
I'm pretty sure.

[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:46.880]
Pretty evident by that night.

[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:48.040]
But oh yeah.

[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:49.800]
She does have my home phone number.

[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:49.800]

[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:51.120]
She's telling me in a restaurant.

[02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:57.960]
This wasn't in some kind of like romantic setting, like in some kind of a singles bar where people are getting cozy at the bar.

[02:03:58.220 --> 02:03:59.880]
This was a restaurant.

[02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:02.380]
Stan Major almost lost it.

[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:07.400]
And this man put on a display with her that I got to be honest with you.

[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:11.180]
Dr. Ruth was on her way in to see if she could get you to a part.

[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:12.200]
Well, I had a good time.

[02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:13.540]
Now bet you did.

[02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:17.980]
I mean, there were like body parts hanging all over the table.

[02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:19.540]
In fact, I noticed that fondue.

[02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:21.180]
There was something went through there real quick.

[02:04:21.180 --> 02:04:22.140]
I'm not sure what it was.

[02:04:22.900 --> 02:04:26.660]
But God Almighty, that was a really, and that was so typical, man.

[02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:31.180]
This guy just any excuse to start fondling and grabbing any of the voluptuous young man.

[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:33.160]
Even not so voluptuous.

[02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:35.400]
I mean, if it's alive, man, it's got the...

[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:36.200]
Well, that's not true.

[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:37.400]
I have my taste.

[02:04:38.420 --> 02:04:39.640]
I have my things I like.

[02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:41.560]
It looks like Phoebe Cateson drag, man.

[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:42.020]
Look at that.

[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:42.480]
All right.

[02:04:42.580 --> 02:04:45.740]
We got one open line for that last hour, which of course is always the big one.

[02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:46.980]
Our big one to two hour.

[02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:50.400]
Well, if we're in Erika, I've never been able to figure out what that means.

[02:04:50.580 --> 02:04:51.740]
The big nine to ten hour.

[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:52.640]
What does that mean?

[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:54.080]
What does that mean?

[02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:54.800]

[02:04:55.060 --> 02:04:57.320]
They're always saying stay tuned for the big nine.

[02:04:57.800 --> 02:04:59.200]
Like, why is that the big hour?

[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:01.740]
Why is that any bigger than like six to seven?

[02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:02.840]
I don't understand it.

[02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:04.120]
Maybe Mike can explain it on Monday.

[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:05.380]
Anyway, it sounds good.

[02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:07.840]
Palm Beach is open, 655 WIOD.

[02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:12.300]
If you're calling from Jupiter or, I'm forcing Lucy or Uranus and Augustine.

[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:15.980]
April, the very self-same thing that is standing by with the news.

[02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:18.020]
And we'll come back for our final hour at 105.

[02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:29.740]
New York City sucks.

[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:30.420]
It does here.

[02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:31.680]
That's a lot of crap.

[02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:34.620]
We were talking about visiting the old clichets.

[02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:36.420]
A nice place to visit, but you wouldn't want to live there.

[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:37.460]
I agree with you.

[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:37.900]
I agree.

[02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:38.740]
I do.

[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:41.740]
When I stand for New York, I always make sure people know it's an upstate New York.

[02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:44.180]
Because the city and upstate New York are totally different.

[02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:45.320]
Oh, then to visit it's fabulous.

[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:46.620]
But it's far and being a tourist.

[02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:49.840]
No, you don't want to go to upstate New York and see the mountains.

[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:51.020]
I mean, that's about as boring.

[02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:52.440]
You can see that on a postcard.

[02:05:53.720 --> 02:05:54.840]
But you've been there many times.

[02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:58.120]
Well, if you, if you, if you, it sucks so bad, why have you been there many times?

[02:05:58.120 --> 02:05:59.260]
Why did you go back?

[02:05:59.560 --> 02:06:01.040]
Did somebody force you?

[02:06:01.040 --> 02:06:02.060]
Here comes the response.

[02:06:02.060 --> 02:06:03.460]
Okay, here it comes on a screen.

[02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:05.280]
I lived there.

[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:07.680]
Oh, well, I guess that's an excuse.

[02:06:08.060 --> 02:06:08.980]
Well, no, wait a minute.

[02:06:09.340 --> 02:06:10.880]
But, you know, in a way, this is good.

[02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:13.460]
Because at least he's saying he lived there and it sucks.

[02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:15.140]
He's got an excuse for leaving.

[02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:18.900]
Unlike a lot of the New Yorkers who are down here who keep complaining.

[02:06:18.900 --> 02:06:20.020]
It was so great there.

[02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:21.500]
And how it sucks here.

[02:06:21.680 --> 02:06:21.860]
Yeah.

[02:06:22.060 --> 02:06:22.320]
Okay.

[02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:25.640]
And you say to them, well, if it was so great there, how come you left?

[02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:26.600]
Okay.

[02:06:27.440 --> 02:06:27.680]
They didn't.

[02:06:27.740 --> 02:06:28.940]
I do agree to live there.

[02:06:28.940 --> 02:06:30.800]
I wouldn't want to live there for all of money in the world.

[02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:36.400]
I've been approached twice by WABC under their former ownership when they weren't as knee-and-earth

[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:37.080]
all as they are now.

[02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:41.620]
And quite frankly, I have very mixed emotions about working in New York because I wouldn't

[02:06:41.620 --> 02:06:42.140]
want to live there.

[02:06:42.340 --> 02:06:43.620]
And I sure wouldn't want to live in Jersey.

[02:06:43.780 --> 02:06:44.040]
No.

[02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:47.360]
I almost accepted a job one time in Trenton many, many years ago.

[02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:48.160]
Boy.

[02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:52.600]
And I drove up there and I drove around the city and I looked around and I put my nose clip

[02:06:52.600 --> 02:06:52.940]
on.

[02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:54.160]
Oh, God.

[02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:55.720]
What a horrible place.

[02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:57.340]
Not everyone.

[02:06:57.660 --> 02:07:01.520]
I went and I met the manager and the people in the station and I was just on the verge.

[02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:04.740]
I was going to be the program director of that station and I just drove out of town.

[02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:05.620]
I never went back.

[02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:06.180]
Good thing.

[02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:07.120]
Trust your instincts.

[02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:08.800]
Stinks is the word.

[02:07:08.980 --> 02:07:09.080]
Yeah.

[02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:10.860]
But I love visiting up there.

[02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:11.940]
Yeah.

[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:13.000]
New York to visit.

[02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:14.040]
New York is exciting.

[02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:17.500]
I don't care what anybody, even Nick, I care what anybody says.

[02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:18.280]
It is exciting.

[02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:22.440]
If you've never been there, it's like a little child in a candy store.

[02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:23.560]
I mean, you just go nuts.

[02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:25.780]
But by Friday, I was ready to go home.

[02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:25.960]
Yeah.

[02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:26.420]
Oh, yeah.

[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:29.580]
After a couple of days after a couple of days, I see a weekend would be nice.

[02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:31.040]
I used to spend five days there.

[02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:31.520]
Something like that.

[02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:36.080]
When I lived in Boston and I had my first car, I had a little 1960 Corvere.

[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:40.800]
And a couple of friends in mine would get in a car and we would head to New York, which

[02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:42.160]
from Boston's not a long drive.

[02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:43.100]
It's a couple of miles.

[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.100]
And almost every weekend we would wind up in New York.

[02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:50.220]
That was back in 1961, almost 30 years ago.

[02:07:50.660 --> 02:07:53.760]
Now, I'm not saying there wasn't any crime, but it isn't like it is today.

[02:07:53.960 --> 02:07:56.760]
It was those days you could walk the streets at two, three in the morning.

[02:07:56.880 --> 02:07:58.060]
And there'd be so many people out.

[02:07:58.400 --> 02:07:59.420]
You'd feel safe.

[02:07:59.700 --> 02:08:02.480]
You didn't have to keep your hand on your wallet and keep looking around you.

[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:03.160]
Not that way.

[02:08:03.220 --> 02:08:04.120]
And it was just tremendous.

[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:05.560]
It was an incredible experience.

[02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:08.840]
Boy, this is like a little bit of nostalgia, boring in it.

[02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:10.680]
OK, let's go to this mobile.

[02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:10.980]
Hello.

[02:08:11.500 --> 02:08:12.060]
Hello, Neil.

[02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:12.520]
Yeah.

[02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:16.620]
Now, I called you the other day and I told the way I went to the phone.

[02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:18.380]
I was on a mobile phone and he said, yeah.

[02:08:18.980 --> 02:08:20.480]
Hunt your horns for me.

[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:21.480]
You know, I'll prove it.

[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:24.140]
But you know, I'll hunt my horn every one got upset and trapped.

[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:25.320]
But today I called.

[02:08:25.940 --> 02:08:29.440]
And I never had a chance to tell him I was on a mobile phone.

[02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:32.380]
So I called back and he got mad at me for calling back.

[02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:36.300]
He said, you already called and I already knew you run a mobile phone.

[02:08:36.420 --> 02:08:37.980]
And now he knew.

[02:08:38.060 --> 02:08:38.820]
Yeah, he knows.

[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:42.520]
He was like yelling and like, don't go analyzing the job.

[02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:43.760]
And he knows everything.

[02:08:44.020 --> 02:08:44.240]
OK.

[02:08:44.460 --> 02:08:44.980]
It was amazing.

[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:45.840]
The nose knows.

[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:47.740]
Anyway, I forgot what I called.

[02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:48.220]
Oh, yeah.

[02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:50.600]
Why the hell did you call me?

[02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:53.860]
I called because I have some very serious problems.

[02:08:54.420 --> 02:08:54.660]
And I was going to have to go out.

[02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:55.500]
That's pretty obvious.

[02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:55.840]

[02:08:56.380 --> 02:08:57.620]
No, I really do.

[02:08:57.720 --> 02:08:59.660]
Listen, what is the story with this envelope?

[02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:03.300]
You want us to mail us a tape or we should send you a tape?

[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:03.880]
Oh.

[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:07.420]
Or we send you a self-adjusted envelope and then you mail us what?

[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:08.120]
What's going on?

[02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:08.400]
Why?

[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:08.720]

[02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:08.960]
Why?

[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:10.040]
How does that work?

[02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:13.420]
It's 112 at WIOD.

[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:15.620]
You know, like we were talking today, how people didn't do it, right?

[02:09:15.620 --> 02:09:16.840]
When they sent in their...

[02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:20.640]
See, I'm not going to even begin with him to try to explain it seriously.

[02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:21.440]
Not to him.

[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:22.920]
Well, I will do the audience.

[02:09:22.980 --> 02:09:23.100]
Yeah.

[02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:26.200]
But to the caller, I, he kind of disappeared for some strange reason.

[02:09:27.020 --> 02:09:29.660]
But after we do the break, I will come back and explain it.

[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:33.020]
And Dan Quill would say our vice president elect.

[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:34.460]
And it's so complicated.

[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:35.660]
I will explain it to you.

[02:09:35.780 --> 02:09:36.620]
OK, it's very simple.

[02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:37.940]
Even a moron can do it.

[02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:38.380]
OK, sir?

[02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:42.120]
Don't take it personally, but even an idiot can do it.

[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:44.360]
But first I want to tell you about Newton line.

[02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:46.080]
115 at WIOD.

[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:47.360]
Just try to control yourself.

[02:09:47.540 --> 02:09:49.720]
Now Steve is still emotional about yesterday's show.

[02:09:51.980 --> 02:09:53.900]
That was that Alan Becker, man.

[02:09:53.940 --> 02:09:55.380]
And I thought he was a pretty good guy.

[02:09:55.980 --> 02:09:58.240]
Thank God Larry Smith is in Congress and not him.

[02:09:58.320 --> 02:09:58.600]
Thank you, man.

[02:09:59.260 --> 02:10:00.800]
Well, that's what Sharon told me.

[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:02.980]
Yeah, but you know, that Evan Ezer's screw drew team.

[02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:04.280]
That doesn't the...

[02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:07.820]
So with me, why does Sharon look like she just wanted an ostrich?

[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:08.500]
Mm-hmm.

[02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:09.640]
Could you...

[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:12.640]
It turns out in this particular...

[02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:16.580]
In these particular condo documents of the viewpoint, condo and marketing...

[02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:16.880]
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

[02:10:16.980 --> 02:10:20.920]
Flores is bringing their food for Cheryl, Becky and Sandy.

[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:21.940]
And it's not here yet.

[02:10:22.020 --> 02:10:22.400]
What have you been to?

[02:10:22.460 --> 02:10:23.200]
Waited about two hours?

[02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:24.780]
One hour.

[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:26.060]
Now listen, Carmine.

[02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:29.080]
I realize I'm on the diet and I appreciate very much all you have done for me.

[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:31.080]
But our other folks are starving here, man.

[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:33.240]
It looks like Cheryl looks like she's going to pass out.

[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:33.760]
Mm-hmm.

[02:10:33.860 --> 02:10:34.680]
She's going to fade away.

[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:36.460]
She's on a caring carpenter program anyway.

[02:10:36.580 --> 02:10:36.780]
She is.

[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:42.840]
So if Carmine will hurry up and get their button gear, okay, is what the message says, okay?

[02:10:43.180 --> 02:10:43.960]
She looked desperate.

[02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:48.700]
And Farbeq for me to, you know, harass our friends at Flores because they've been so kind to us,

[02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:50.520]
but you know, these other people get pushy.

[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:54.500]
By the way, Joe is sending down ducks, speaking about from Taff Street Root.

[02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:55.340]
Yes, today.

[02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:56.060]
Great.

[02:10:56.280 --> 02:10:57.220]
Today, crispy duck.

[02:10:57.400 --> 02:10:58.040]
You know what they say?

[02:10:58.180 --> 02:10:58.680]
The best duck.

[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:00.620]
Especially a butt-licking duck.

[02:11:00.740 --> 02:11:01.980]
Have you ever had a Taff Street duck?

[02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:03.160]
They're duckers.

[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:05.080]
No, I can't say that I've had a Taff Street duck.

[02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:06.140]
Unbelievable.

[02:11:06.420 --> 02:11:07.180]
I'm not into duck.

[02:11:07.260 --> 02:11:07.880]
I'm not into duck.

[02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:08.780]
You know, crispy.

[02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:10.820]
Maybe a little bit every now and then, but not a duck.

[02:11:10.940 --> 02:11:11.580]
Make your mouth water.

[02:11:11.660 --> 02:11:15.280]
Anyway, getting back to the show yesterday, it turns out in the viewpoint condos by-laws,

[02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:22.040]
they permit a child, you know, to stay if all the Board of Directors has to do is say that it's a worthy exception.

[02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:25.080]
And so that's what turned the attorney around.

[02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:26.180]
Now, he was on our side.

[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:26.740]
Oh, really?

[02:11:27.060 --> 02:11:29.480]
And anybody who has a comedian at the moment, right now.

[02:11:29.540 --> 02:11:33.500]
You want to give out the number of the condo again and have them call his heads for Algi.

[02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:35.420]
Do you have the number of the nickel put it up on the board?

[02:11:35.460 --> 02:11:36.640]
We're going to give that out throughout the day.

[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:37.760]
The viewpoint is on the monitor.

[02:11:37.780 --> 02:11:39.820]
And the audience is like, what the hell are you talking about?

[02:11:40.300 --> 02:11:41.340]
Well, he's got to help put it up.

[02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:41.980]
He's got all.

[02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:43.120]
He's on the board.

[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:44.540]
Although he hates New York, you know.

[02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:46.140]
And what does he know?

[02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:47.120]
You ever been to New York?

[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:48.140]
He lived in New York.

[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:49.520]
He said he's been there many times.

[02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:50.160]
He hates it.

[02:11:50.220 --> 02:11:50.960]
He lived there.

[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:51.640]
Ridiculous.

[02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:52.680]
Greatest place in the world.

[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:53.760]
It's a tremendous place.

[02:11:54.020 --> 02:11:54.360]
To visit.

[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:55.480]
The center of the universe.

[02:11:56.220 --> 02:11:56.500]
New York.

[02:11:56.620 --> 02:11:56.880]
It is.

[02:11:57.240 --> 02:11:57.560]
Absolutely.

[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:03.000]
And I'll say it again, if there are people out there, there are two places where you must go while you're still alive.

[02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:05.260]
For some of you, that means you better go this week.

[02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:06.020]
Go quick.

[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:07.440]
Yeah, especially in this town.

[02:12:07.660 --> 02:12:07.760]
Okay.

[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:10.920]
One of them is New York and the other place is Hawaii.

[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:12.360]
I never been to Hawaii.

[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:13.060]
Oh, really?

[02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:16.040]
You got to get sunny to take you and Laurie along with him.

[02:12:16.740 --> 02:12:17.800]
Sonny's getting to go to Hawaii.

[02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:18.420]
To Hawaii?

[02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:20.360]
Because of the basketball game or something out there.

[02:12:20.740 --> 02:12:21.460]
You're kidding.

[02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:22.200]
No, I'm not kidding.

[02:12:22.260 --> 02:12:23.040]
He's going next week.

[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:24.580]
Hawaii is a paradise.

[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.540]
Hawaii is truly paradise.

[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:33.020]
I'm telling you, living and breeding people and fun and the climate is perfect and they're always those trade winds blow in.

[02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:34.340]
So it's not humid and oppressive.

[02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:36.340]
Even though it's like 86, 87 all the time.

[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:37.440]
It's tremendous.

[02:12:37.660 --> 02:12:38.400]
Sounds wonderful.

[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:38.920]
It is.

[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:42.620]
And I have like all those fresh fruits out there stuff.

[02:12:42.900 --> 02:12:43.760]
Okay, you're not impressed.

[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:44.520]
I know I am.

[02:12:44.660 --> 02:12:45.400]
It was great.

[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:46.340]
I like I prefer you.

[02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:47.780]
If you never been to Europe, I've been trying to get...

[02:12:47.780 --> 02:12:48.420]
No, this summer.

[02:12:48.740 --> 02:12:50.020]
Next summer, I'm going to your London.

[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:50.700]
No.

[02:12:51.180 --> 02:12:51.900]
You will love London.

[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:52.820]
You should stop at London.

[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:55.080]
No, I've already seen enough queens in my life.

[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:01.660]
So anyways, Steve has open phones today and he's going to be talking about the crotch watchers again.

[02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:03.620]
So look out.

[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:07.520]
Those little old ladies are getting their binoculars out right now as we speak.

[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:09.060]
Okay, we have an open line in date.

[02:13:09.060 --> 02:13:10.540]
If you move very, very quickly now.

[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:12.360]
7519463.

[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:14.420]
That is 751WID.

[02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:15.760]
Boka, hello.

[02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:17.420]
Boka.

[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:18.840]
Be gone.

[02:13:19.260 --> 02:13:20.020]
Miami, hello.

[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:21.060]
Hello?

[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:21.560]
Yeah.

[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:23.080]
Uh, am I on?

[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:24.900]
Yeah, did I catch you off guard there, sir?

[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:26.060]
Oh, am sorry.

[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:26.820]
You do...

[02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:27.200]
Oh, it's okay.

[02:13:27.380 --> 02:13:27.980]
This is in the building.

[02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:28.860]
Don't be sorry.

[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:29.840]
What do you mean it's in the building?

[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:30.360]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:31.000]
I was on hold.

[02:13:31.100 --> 02:13:32.100]
I thought Mike called me on the room.

[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:33.520]
What do you mean it's in the building?

[02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:34.800]
Oh, I think you're pardoned.

[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:36.480]
I thought someone else picked up the other end of the line.

[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:36.900]
That's okay.

[02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:38.480]
Don't you sound awful confused now.

[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:40.620]
Yeah, I like that you got to have a good reason to be.

[02:13:40.780 --> 02:13:41.920]
Are you calling me or Nick?

[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:42.740]
I'm calling you.

[02:13:42.860 --> 02:13:44.460]
But after waiting so long, I wasn't sure.

[02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:45.380]
Well, I just...

[02:13:45.380 --> 02:13:50.340]
Well, I just got back from Miami Beach where I was severely traumatized by a purple hair.

[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:50.700]
No.

[02:13:50.700 --> 02:13:52.500]
And I know why you sound so confused.

[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:54.520]
And if I don't unload this, I'm going to go nuts.

[02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:55.260]
I'm still taking.

[02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:57.740]
I'm going down broad causeway.

[02:13:58.140 --> 02:13:59.760]
It's like a 40-mile an hour speed limit.

[02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:00.840]
I have the green light.

[02:14:01.580 --> 02:14:06.020]
And I see a fluorescent orange hair on the top of a little old lady come out between the cars.

[02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:07.000]
Oh, wait a minute, sir.

[02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:07.700]
Yeah.

[02:14:08.420 --> 02:14:14.840]
Here is the Gold Coast property management number for those who are distressed about the plate of that nine-year-old little girl.

[02:14:17.180 --> 02:14:17.980]
741-4666.

[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:19.500]
That's a brown number that's in a market.

[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:22.040]
741-4666.

[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:22.740]
Go ahead, sir.

[02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:26.980]
Oh, so anyway, a J-walking purple hair walks out in front of me.

[02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:30.960]
And I was going to go around, but I looked in my rearview mirror, and there's the big Cadillac following me.

[02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:33.360]
I figure if I do that, the Cadillac is going to hit her.

[02:14:34.020 --> 02:14:38.180]
So I stop as quickly as I can and miss her by about a foot and guess what happens.

[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:39.340]
You got it.

[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:41.000]
I get rear-ended by the Cadillac.

[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:42.000]
Unbelievable.

[02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:47.000]
So I stopped about, I would say 10 inches from this lady, and she's shuffling, you know, about four inches of step.

[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:52.720]
She decides that in the middle of the intersection, after causing an accident, she's completely oblivious to.

[02:14:53.340 --> 02:14:54.580]
Depards the light of cigarette.

[02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:58.700]
Wait, wait, sir, can I straighten you up?

[02:14:58.740 --> 02:15:00.320]
Can I explain something to you?

[02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:03.780]
You don't understand that there's a thing on the beach.

[02:15:03.780 --> 02:15:05.000]
It's like an unwritten code.

[02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:08.400]
She was probably one of the kamikaze pedestrian.

[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:11.340]
No, seriously, I'm Collins Avenue.

[02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:12.000]
It's very big.

[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:18.380]
You must be over the age of 80, and what you do is you wait until the don't walk light starts flashing,

[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:26.060]
and you then step out into the middle of the road, and you dare the motorist to hit you, hoping and praying that somebody will.

[02:15:27.060 --> 02:15:27.360]
Okay.

[02:15:27.700 --> 02:15:29.900]
Those are the kamikaze pedestrians on the beach.

[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:30.800]
There's more.

[02:15:31.740 --> 02:15:36.180]
After she got the unlighting her cigarette, she threw the match, which was still lit on the hood of my car.

[02:15:37.940 --> 02:15:39.200]
Well, that should tell you something.

[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:42.020]
I've completely emotionally drained.

[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:44.500]
Now do you realize that you should be just going ahead?

[02:15:45.340 --> 02:15:47.300]
Well, and let nature take its course.

[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:51.100]
I thought these little, got that these blue hair horror stories were funny, but I don't anymore.

[02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:51.580]
They're not.

[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:52.320]
They're not.

[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:52.360]
They're not.

[02:15:52.620 --> 02:15:52.640]
They're not.

[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:52.740]
They're not.

[02:15:52.740 --> 02:15:52.920]
They're not.

[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:52.920]

[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:52.940]
They're not.

[02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:52.940]

[02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:52.940]

[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:53.280]
They're not.

[02:15:53.340 --> 02:15:53.500]
They're not.

[02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:53.500]

[02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:53.580]
They're not.

[02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:53.600]
They're not.

[02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:54.960]
They're not.

[02:16:07.620 --> 02:16:07.980]
They're not.

[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:25.860]
They're not.

[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:29.380]
They're not.

[02:16:29.780 --> 02:16:30.940]
They're not.

[02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:32.460]
They're not.

[02:16:32.780 --> 02:16:33.120]
They're not.

[02:16:33.380 --> 02:16:34.180]
They're not.

[02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:34.280]
They're not.

[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:34.300]
They're not.

[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:34.300]

[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:34.300]

[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:34.300]

[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:34.300]

[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:34.300]

[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:34.300]

[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:34.300]

[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:34.300]

[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:34.300]

[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:34.300]

[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:34.300]

[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:34.780]
They're not.

[02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:35.620]

[02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:35.640]
They're not.

[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:35.640]

[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:35.880]
They're not.

[02:16:36.260 --> 02:16:36.780]
They're not.

[02:16:37.420 --> 02:16:37.420]

[02:16:37.460 --> 02:16:37.720]
They're not.

[02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:37.720]

[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:37.960]
They're not.

[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:44.160]
They're not.

[02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:44.860]
They're not.

[02:16:45.420 --> 02:16:45.940]
They're not.

[02:16:45.940 --> 02:16:45.940]

[02:16:45.940 --> 02:16:45.960]
They're not.

[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:45.960]

[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:53.720]
Everyone has their love to play somewhere.

[02:17:01.520 --> 02:17:03.180]
Everyone has their love to play somewhere.

[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:07.640]
Everyone has their love to play somewhere.

[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:12.640]
I heard that yesterday people were calling and she was getting hysterical and screaming at him and threatening Steve and

[02:17:13.220 --> 02:17:14.780]
It says ask for Mickey

[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:18.920]
741-4666

[02:17:20.100 --> 02:17:27.480]
Also on those cassette tapes which were putting some of our bits and whatever on which are again for private enjoyment not for

[02:17:28.220 --> 02:17:33.000]
Any other use than that including commercial use not for any other stations to steal our bits

[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:39.280]
But if you want one of those tapes and we're putting them together this weekend just send us a 90 minute cassette

[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:45.820]
Along with hopefully a stamp self-adreced envelope and a donation to CamillaSaus for 20 bucks or more

[02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:53.640]
That's pretty simple isn't it? Three things the cassette, the check, 20 bucks or more to CamillaSaus and hopefully a stamp self-adreced envelope

[02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:59.000]
And mail it to CamillaSaus, care of NeoRodgers WIOD, Miami 33141

[02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:03.360]
NeoRodgers WIOD, Miami 33141

[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:06.100]
Very simple even a mung brain

[02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:09.000]
Could do it okay? Even a simpleton

[02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:12.680]
I'm not talking about the guy who called in the car before am I? Maybe

[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:17.000]
Okay it's 24 past 1 speaking of cars if you're in the market radio 610

[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:19.000]
WIOD

[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:26.120]
It's 128 WIOD the thing that I like best about the way Nick puts these things on the screen is that he gives you a little play by play on his collar

[02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:31.380]
And the one on this one is moving I'm not gonna say anything. Let's just find out what the story is Barry

[02:18:31.380 --> 02:18:32.640]

[02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:33.760]

And I'm Barry is mobile, Neo how are you today?

[02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:36.900]
Okay

[02:18:36.900 --> 02:18:38.360]
I know you're on a diet

[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:39.080]
How are you Barry?

[02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:40.280]
I'm real good good

[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:40.780]
Good

[02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:41.500]
Great

[02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:46.340]
I know you're on a diet but in January in the middle of January sometimes we're

[02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:51.280]
Oh this is wait a minute wait a minute now this is Barry that called Steve a couple of days ago

[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:54.980]
Yeah yeah yeah come on

[02:18:55.600 --> 02:18:57.760]
This is Barry from Florida limousine?

[02:18:58.080 --> 02:18:59.320]
Florida limousine guy

[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:01.940]
I don't know that. Every week Barry that was talking about Al

[02:19:01.940 --> 02:19:02.880]
Is it for a Camilla's house?

[02:19:03.340 --> 02:19:03.680]
Yeah

[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:05.100]
Oh that Barry

[02:19:05.100 --> 02:19:06.840]
Right, okay I guess

[02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:12.880]
Okay but I want to tell you in the middle of January we're gonna bring you down a low calorie pizza

[02:19:13.500 --> 02:19:18.520]
Believe it or not Mario the Baker from Miami is opening a store pizza light in Boka

[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:19.420]
Pizza light

[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:20.480]
Wow

[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:27.320]
And it's a low calorie pizza and you and Gland are gonna get the first one around the middle of January

[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:30.080]
Well I bet you'll end it we'll just love that it's not your time to die

[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:31.740]

We're sending it down down to you in the middle of January I hope you guys have a great holiday

[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:41.440]
And Neo do you think we can get one of those tapes for the cocktail party we threw for Camilla's house?

[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:44.040]
I'm sure you can Barry

[02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:45.140]
I'll send it down to you

[02:19:45.140 --> 02:19:45.580]
Okay

[02:19:45.580 --> 02:19:46.280]
Have a good holiday

[02:19:46.280 --> 02:19:46.800]
You too

[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:47.220]
Bye-bye

[02:19:48.580 --> 02:19:51.780]
Okay so he didn't complain about anything or is that because we kept it short

[02:19:51.780 --> 02:19:53.000]
Okay 129

[02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:58.200]
At WIOD we have an open line in Boka at the 278 9463

[02:19:58.200 --> 02:20:00.820]
I'm getting a headache from the cigar you know it's getting ponderous

[02:20:00.820 --> 02:20:01.040]
Yeah

[02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:03.620]
If Alan is still listening I'm sure he's not

[02:20:03.620 --> 02:20:06.860]
I'm talking about Alan Finkelson not Alan your friend

[02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:09.540]
Boka hello

[02:20:09.540 --> 02:20:10.540]
Hi Neo

[02:20:10.540 --> 02:20:11.160]
Yes sir

[02:20:11.160 --> 02:20:17.540]
This show yesterday reminded me you know what the only difference is between a dead condo attorney lying in the street

[02:20:17.540 --> 02:20:19.980]
And a dead dog lying in the street

[02:20:20.560 --> 02:20:21.320]
I'm listening

[02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:23.140]
This kid marks before the dogs

[02:20:23.140 --> 02:20:24.160]
Oh yeah

[02:20:24.160 --> 02:20:30.440]
And I've got to tell you I listen to Leo almost every day because sometimes I can't handle Steve he's just ponderous

[02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:35.260]
And I'm telling you it's you probably you're hard at hearing too so you're likely because you can hear every word

[02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:36.660]
Even without a radio

[02:20:36.660 --> 02:20:38.020]
It's like listening to your show Neo

[02:20:38.020 --> 02:20:40.500]
I mean everything from bbaba bbaba bbaba

[02:20:40.500 --> 02:20:44.840]
But don't ever call this station again and you name it he's stolen it

[02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:45.620]
You mean Lee

[02:20:45.620 --> 02:20:46.240]
Lee

[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:52.960]
Yeah, Lee ought to be really he ought to be under investigation for stealing more material than any other host in the history

[02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:56.220]
Even a laceter I don't think has got as far as Lee as blatant

[02:20:56.220 --> 02:21:03.900]
And yesterday was yesterday top to cake with Steve's favorite guest on talking about motorcycles and wearing helmets

[02:21:03.900 --> 02:21:04.920]
And who's got the right one

[02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:07.200]
Oh God he had Mr. Exxon I still can't get over that

[02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:12.160]
I mean you talk about a insesctuous relationship I just can't get over that

[02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:16.860]
Well sometimes you need to put your finger down your throat when you're listening to Lee but yesterday you didn't have to you just puke

[02:21:16.860 --> 02:21:17.220]
Yeah

[02:21:17.220 --> 02:21:20.940]
Yeah in fact it was like the Karen Carpenter diet made easy

[02:21:20.940 --> 02:21:21.520]
Then four

[02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:22.560]
Okay, thank you

[02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:23.240]
Good day

[02:21:24.500 --> 02:21:25.820]
131 at WIOD

[02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:28.940]
I still can't get over that I had almost forgotten it

[02:21:28.940 --> 02:21:29.300]
What?

[02:21:29.740 --> 02:21:31.620]
The fact that Lee had Mr. Exxon

[02:21:31.620 --> 02:21:31.860]
Yeah

[02:21:31.860 --> 02:21:34.880]
Part of that little triumvirative insesctuous douchebags

[02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:36.780]
Understandable that you would forget that

[02:21:36.780 --> 02:21:39.060]
And you know the thing I really can't understand

[02:21:39.060 --> 02:21:43.000]
Remember yesterday we got that $500 check for Camilla Sons from Norman Kent

[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:48.000]
Now Norman is like a liberal guy I mean he's about as liberal as you can get

[02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:49.360]
Right?

[02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:54.560]
Now where does he fit in with Mr. Exx and Lee Fowler?

[02:21:54.720 --> 02:21:55.200]
Fowler?

[02:21:55.260 --> 02:21:55.460]
You know?

[02:21:55.660 --> 02:21:55.900]
Maybe

[02:21:55.900 --> 02:21:57.260]
No I don't understand that at all

[02:21:57.260 --> 02:22:00.380]
I mean Steve I can understand because Steve you know is oblivious

[02:22:00.380 --> 02:22:04.600]
I mean he just ignores the philosophy of I mean when Hermann Gehring comes over for lunch

[02:22:04.600 --> 02:22:06.140]
And yeah you know he's not a bad guy

[02:22:06.140 --> 02:22:10.840]
He just ignores that stuff but Norman Kent and the Mr. Exxon Lee Fowler

[02:22:10.840 --> 02:22:12.420]
That is a strange group

[02:22:12.420 --> 02:22:12.780]
Yeah

[02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:13.820]
It is

[02:22:13.820 --> 02:22:14.600]
It is

[02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:16.300]
Especially Mr. Exxon Norman Kent

[02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:18.660]
And that is really interesting

[02:22:18.660 --> 02:22:21.000]
And are they involved in the male bonding those two?

[02:22:21.540 --> 02:22:22.300]
I think they are

[02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:24.040]
Shocked

[02:22:27.580 --> 02:22:28.280]
Isn't it?

[02:22:28.340 --> 02:22:29.520]
Oh God

[02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:31.480]
Now I haven't seen Mr. Exxon's check yet

[02:22:31.480 --> 02:22:31.860]
Have you?

[02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:35.540]
I mean I keep hearing about how he's got all this money he's loaded he's got millions

[02:22:35.540 --> 02:22:37.520]
I haven't seen his check for Camille or something yet

[02:22:38.200 --> 02:22:39.160]
We're still waiting

[02:22:39.160 --> 02:22:43.640]
With Bated Breath and of course I'm sure he wouldn't give it to us but you know if he would deliver it to Steve

[02:22:43.640 --> 02:22:48.560]
And then Steve could pass the information along to us we'd be more than delighted to give credit

[02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:51.160]
Or credit is due but I just haven't seen it yet

[02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:52.820]
Well we'll keep our eyes peeled

[02:22:53.480 --> 02:22:58.680]
And right now I'd like to tell you about a tremendous place called La Tabernetta in Tamarack

[02:22:58.680 --> 02:23:03.580]
And they are doing it up big again on New Year's Eve they're having a fantastic champagne supper

[02:23:03.580 --> 02:23:09.580]
And for just 40 bucks you can have a tremendous time on New Year's Eve at La Tabernetta starting at 9 p.m.

[02:23:09.700 --> 02:23:13.540]
And they're going to be serving a choice of 10 spectacular dishes

[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:18.940]
Including chicken federico, shrimp livernes and flounder franchise and lots lots more

[02:23:18.940 --> 02:23:20.220]
And they give you so much food there

[02:23:20.220 --> 02:23:24.000]
By the time you leave you'll be just doing cartwheels in their parking lot

[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:24.320]
Okay

[02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:28.080]
And if you're not one of those folks who likes to go out and brave at Relate on New Year's Eve

[02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:34.320]
There will be an early seating as well and don't forget they're also going to be serving their traditional Italian Christmas Eve dinner

[02:23:34.920 --> 02:23:36.040]
Next Saturday night

[02:23:36.040 --> 02:23:41.300]
So be sure to call now for reservations because La Tabernetta is a small, intimate, fantastic restaurant

[02:23:41.300 --> 02:23:42.940]
And we don't want you to be shut out

[02:23:42.940 --> 02:23:46.120]
Here's a number to call 722-1831

[02:23:47.420 --> 02:23:51.920]
722-1831 you'll find them on McNabro just east of Pine Island in Tamarack

[02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:54.280]
They've been doing a super job there for over 10 years now

[02:23:54.280 --> 02:23:58.040]
Don't forget, great way to celebrate the holidays this year at La Tabernetta

[02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:02.140]
Good afternoon, I'm April Werther

[02:24:02.140 --> 02:24:05.060]
With your 134 update from the WIO DNews Center

[02:24:05.060 --> 02:24:07.700]
These are some of the stories we're following for you at the Sour

[02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:12.720]
Three officers of the Defunctrucks Savings Bank and Hialear are in custody today

[02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:17.140]
The Federal Reserve Board has approved the acquisition of South Florida Savings

[02:24:17.140 --> 02:24:19.620]
And Miami by the Southeast Banking Corporation

[02:24:19.620 --> 02:24:27.100]
And the Governor's Drug Policy Task Force is hearing more suggestions today on how to stem the tide of illegal drugs in the state of Florida

[02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:36.140]
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 5.93 at the Sour details on these and other stories coming up at 2 on WIO DNews Talk Radio 16

[02:24:36.140 --> 02:24:40.840]
It was days before Christmas and through snow, sleet and hail

[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:44.260]
Everyone used Express Mail Service and Priority Mail

[02:24:44.260 --> 02:24:47.480]
Two-pound Priority Mail left smiles on their faces

[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:52.600]
Two dollars 40 and two days between major markets and just three days in all other places

[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:55.760]
With Express Mail Service everything worked out right

[02:24:55.760 --> 02:24:58.860]
Two pounds for 12 bucks delivered all the night

[02:24:58.860 --> 02:25:01.760]
So go to your post office and send gifts off right

[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:04.800]
Merry Christmas to old and to old people of night

[02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:06.160]
Sponsored by your Post Office

[02:25:07.140 --> 02:25:10.100]
Yesterday we talked about picking out a fresh Christmas tree

[02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:13.280]
Today I want to give you some hints for keeping the tree that way

[02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:16.760]
First you can get an anti-transparent from a nursery there

[02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:21.280]
This is sprayed on the foliage and slows the loss of moisture into the air

[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:26.840]
Then you want to have a large capacity tree stand because the average tree requires about a quarter

[02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:28.620]
Preserved of all water per day

[02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:33.360]
You ought to check the stand every day and replenish what the tree has sloped up

[02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:38.300]
If you'd like to have my famous do-it-yourself Super Handy Man's Tree Preservative Farm Reel

[02:25:38.300 --> 02:25:39.180]
Here it is

[02:25:39.180 --> 02:25:47.100]
Get some horticultural iron powder from the nursery store and get a bottle of K-Row crystal clear corn syrup from the supermarket

[02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:49.480]
And while you're there get a bottle of laundry bleach

[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:57.140]
Into a gallon of hot water you add four tablespoons of the iron powder, four teaspoons of the bleach and two cups of the corn syrup

[02:25:57.140 --> 02:26:02.820]
Mix and pour this into the tree stand and check it every day and as needed add hot water

[02:26:02.820 --> 02:26:06.280]
This keeps your tree fresh and makes it less likely to be a fire hazard

[02:26:06.820 --> 02:26:09.040]
I'm an alkyrall the Super Handy Man

[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:12.480]
Brought to you by Home Depot, America's Do-it-yourself warehouse

[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:15.200]
You can search but there's only one

[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:18.160]
I never called though already before but no I the rest

[02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:19.960]
They have turned us down trust me

[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:23.820]
In fact I've been wondering all day I feel like my voice is a little strained

[02:26:23.820 --> 02:26:24.200]
Yeah

[02:26:24.820 --> 02:26:26.420]
Because they've turned this thing down

[02:26:27.260 --> 02:26:29.460]
Somebody has turned our thing down okay

[02:26:30.100 --> 02:26:33.400]
So whoever turned it down please turn it back up

[02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:34.240]
It's too low

[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:37.420]
I like it like where you can hear it

[02:26:37.420 --> 02:26:37.960]
Booming

[02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:40.180]
No not booming but like resonating

[02:26:40.180 --> 02:26:40.740]
Yeah

[02:26:41.460 --> 02:26:43.100]
Okay we have a duck report on six

[02:26:43.100 --> 02:26:43.540]
Hello

[02:26:43.540 --> 02:26:45.200]
Yes Neil, good afternoon

[02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:46.600]
Got a duck report here

[02:26:47.420 --> 02:26:51.260]
It says here I was reading the paper it says duckies to race for charity

[02:26:51.260 --> 02:26:54.000]
I want to know if the duck was familiar with this

[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:54.820]
Duckies?

[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:56.360]
Duckies to race for charity

[02:26:56.360 --> 02:26:57.880]
That what the headline actually says

[02:26:57.880 --> 02:26:59.820]
It's what exactly says in the Sunset and all

[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:00.760]
Duckies

[02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:02.380]
Probably some quack wrote that

[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:06.060]
More than 3000 rubber ducks wearing goggles

[02:27:06.060 --> 02:27:07.120]
And I wanted it to be

[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:10.300]
I wasn't know if the duck was going to be there

[02:27:10.300 --> 02:27:11.960]
Well I don't know if he's planning on be there

[02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:14.840]
But he did have some strange looking goggles on when he came in this morning

[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:16.320]
So that should give you a little tip on

[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:17.320]
That could be it

[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:20.080]
It's supposed to be on the new river tomorrow at noon for charity

[02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:20.680]
Can't wait

[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:21.260]
Yeah

[02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:23.980]
Well there's a chance for him make it big you and noodles can be

[02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:24.860]
Right

[02:27:24.860 --> 02:27:25.560]
Right

[02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:28.080]
I just thought I'd jump in there and say that

[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:29.820]
And don't get no adjutant Neil

[02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:30.280]
Okay

[02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:31.240]
Good day

[02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:31.760]
Good day

[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:33.560]
138-22-2

[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:34.940]
Steve has opened phones today

[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:37.280]
And the only disappointment I have

[02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:40.660]
First of all we only had one lady caller today I think all day right

[02:27:40.660 --> 02:27:42.040]
And that was the lady from the church

[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:43.980]
We had no women again today

[02:27:43.980 --> 02:27:44.400]
Crattle

[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:44.680]
None

[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:46.140]
We had a bunch of you

[02:27:46.140 --> 02:27:47.460]
And we had a bunch yesterday

[02:27:47.460 --> 02:27:48.280]
But today the women

[02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:50.760]
Well this is a bad time for women any shopping

[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:52.760]
Yeah they're out there shopping until they just

[02:27:52.760 --> 02:27:54.720]
You know those credit cards are drained

[02:27:54.720 --> 02:27:56.340]
Every ounce of blood in them

[02:27:56.340 --> 02:27:57.380]
A lot of that going on

[02:27:57.380 --> 02:27:57.680]
Yeah

[02:27:57.680 --> 02:27:59.060]
Oh yeah they're going nuts

[02:27:59.060 --> 02:28:01.700]
Okay we have an open line in three of them actually now

[02:28:01.700 --> 02:28:02.600]
This is incredible

[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:04.520]
And we still have 22 minutes to kill here

[02:28:04.520 --> 02:28:06.700]
Indeed 751

[02:28:07.740 --> 02:28:08.180]
WIOD

[02:28:08.660 --> 02:28:13.120]
And in Palm Beach 655-9463

[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:14.920]
655-WID

[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:16.760]
Well I give the numbers for Palm Beach because they're

[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:18.120]
Basically they're dumb

[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:20.000]
Miami, hello

[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:20.600]
Hi Neil

[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:20.980]
Hi

[02:28:20.980 --> 02:28:22.740]
Um, um, a lady

[02:28:22.740 --> 02:28:24.100]
A first time caller

[02:28:24.100 --> 02:28:24.920]
It's not a lady

[02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:26.080]
Oh it's a young kid

[02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:27.640]
Yeah we're all skipping school

[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:28.400]
Why?

[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:31.460]
Why because it's the last day of the school year

[02:28:31.460 --> 02:28:33.660]
Oh so you're getting like an extra day right

[02:28:33.660 --> 02:28:34.440]
Getting a head start

[02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:36.940]
Is this what they mean when they talk about the head start program?

[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:38.220]
Something like that

[02:28:38.220 --> 02:28:38.440]
Yeah

[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:40.400]
Um, yeah it's international

[02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:42.960]
That was real cute wasn't it cute?

[02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:43.380]
Yeah

[02:28:44.980 --> 02:28:47.720]
Flora's order called in an hour and a half ago

[02:28:48.220 --> 02:28:51.640]
They said five minute delivery 20 minutes ago

[02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:52.800]
And it still isn't here

[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:54.720]
They're upset and I understand

[02:28:54.720 --> 02:28:56.200]
Well let me ask you a question

[02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:59.240]
Do they ordinarily deliver or do they just do that for us?

[02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:00.100]
They do deliver

[02:29:00.500 --> 02:29:01.960]
And it's been an hour and a half

[02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:04.620]
See now if we would be having them bring in food all the time

[02:29:04.620 --> 02:29:05.540]
If I weren't on the diet

[02:29:05.540 --> 02:29:07.500]
The food would have been here like by 11.30

[02:29:07.500 --> 02:29:07.520]
Yeah

[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:11.580]
But that's the brakes man when you don't rate

[02:29:11.580 --> 02:29:13.320]
It goes to show you how much weight you put

[02:29:14.620 --> 02:29:16.060]
So car mine what's going on?

[02:29:16.060 --> 02:29:17.560]
Now maybe car mines are the track today

[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:19.640]
Because I know car mine would never tolerate that

[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:20.000]
Okay

[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:21.000]
He's not the track

[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.700]
Yeah we definitely don't want to create any bad vibes with fur

[02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:25.180]
Because we love their food

[02:29:25.180 --> 02:29:25.480]
Yeah

[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:28.720]
And they have the best all kinds of good stuff

[02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:31.560]
But Cheryl is having an nervous breakdown

[02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:34.020]
She's about ready to start doing cartwheels in the atrium

[02:29:34.020 --> 02:29:34.380]
Okay

[02:29:34.380 --> 02:29:35.200]
My understanding

[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:37.820]
So come on car mine cut the nonsense alright

[02:29:37.820 --> 02:29:39.520]
Let's get with it

[02:29:41.500 --> 02:29:42.440]
Can you believe that?

[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:44.040]
Probably the guy ate it on the way over

[02:29:44.040 --> 02:29:46.500]
Okay I mean delivery guy's got to eat too

[02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:47.980]
Bokeh hello

[02:29:47.980 --> 02:29:48.480]
Yes

[02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:49.700]
Is this male?

[02:29:50.260 --> 02:29:50.700]
Yes

[02:29:50.700 --> 02:29:53.340]
I have three things to say and then a butt

[02:29:54.040 --> 02:29:56.140]
The first thing is I can barely hear you

[02:29:56.140 --> 02:29:57.300]
Oh I beg your pardon

[02:29:57.300 --> 02:29:58.500]
That's so much better yeah

[02:29:58.500 --> 02:30:00.080]
Helps when you're talking to phone

[02:30:00.700 --> 02:30:01.880]
Can you hear me now?

[02:30:01.900 --> 02:30:03.100]
Yes I sure can

[02:30:03.100 --> 02:30:03.620]
Alright

[02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:06.180]
I have three things to say and then a butt

[02:30:06.180 --> 02:30:08.720]
The first thing is I'm enjoying your protein

[02:30:08.720 --> 02:30:09.400]
You have a butt?

[02:30:09.800 --> 02:30:10.540]
With a butt

[02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:11.380]
Okay

[02:30:11.380 --> 02:30:16.260]
The second thing is you will once had occasion to be very kind to my husband myself

[02:30:16.260 --> 02:30:18.500]
And again I'm just going to say thank you

[02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:24.560]
And the third thing is that I sent a check of which I can afford to Camilla's house

[02:30:25.140 --> 02:30:26.660]
Now the butt is this

[02:30:26.660 --> 02:30:31.660]
And when they show the pictures of the people, the other people eating

[02:30:31.660 --> 02:30:36.740]
They always show young men from between 20 and 50 those that should be out working

[02:30:36.740 --> 02:30:37.540]
Oh boy

[02:30:37.540 --> 02:30:38.380]
Here we go

[02:30:38.380 --> 02:30:39.620]
No I'm not criticized

[02:30:39.620 --> 02:30:40.700]
I'm not about you

[02:30:40.700 --> 02:30:46.000]
I'm criticizing why don't they show the family eating rather than the young men that could be working

[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:46.560]
Yeah

[02:30:46.560 --> 02:30:48.040]
And should be I'm not criticizing

[02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:50.740]
Well why do you keep saying could be and should be and should be and should be

[02:30:50.740 --> 02:30:52.880]
See when you don't have a place to live

[02:30:53.320 --> 02:30:54.700]
And you don't have any clothing

[02:30:54.700 --> 02:30:58.200]
It's not also easy to get yourself cleaned up and take a shower and shave

[02:30:58.200 --> 02:31:02.180]
And get dressed in a presentable way so you can go out and look for a job and have an address

[02:31:02.180 --> 02:31:04.720]
You know when you go for a job generally have to fill out an application

[02:31:04.720 --> 02:31:06.840]
And you have to have a phone number and an address

[02:31:06.840 --> 02:31:10.700]
So when you keep saying should be should be should be it's very obvious where you're coming from

[02:31:10.700 --> 02:31:12.380]
And I don't want to talk to you okay you old bag

[02:31:12.380 --> 02:31:13.720]
You make me sick

[02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:15.820]
You make me nauseous

[02:31:17.720 --> 02:31:21.420]
I was very kind to her and her I don't know what she's talking about but it's just the bottom line

[02:31:21.420 --> 02:31:23.240]
There's always got to be a butt okay

[02:31:24.060 --> 02:31:27.800]
So in other words basically she would like her money to go to feed the families

[02:31:28.460 --> 02:31:33.360]
But these young people and of course what she'd understand that a lot of these families have young children too

[02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:34.080]
Definitely

[02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:39.300]
Alright including teenage children who also could be working under different circumstances

[02:31:40.260 --> 02:31:42.260]
She was all hard man that's all I can say

[02:31:42.900 --> 02:31:45.380]
Anyway it's 142 and let's go to Hollywood

[02:31:45.380 --> 02:31:48.120]
Okay we right toward the end here we go is get a couple you know

[02:31:48.120 --> 02:31:49.820]
But we have a question here

[02:31:49.820 --> 02:31:50.980]
What is the question?

[02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:51.340]
What is the question?

[02:31:51.680 --> 02:31:55.080]
No no god for well if you want a couple of thousand be good Camilla's house

[02:31:55.080 --> 02:31:55.860]
Camilla's

[02:31:55.860 --> 02:31:57.320]
C-A-M-I-L-L-U-S

[02:31:57.320 --> 02:31:57.700]
Okay

[02:31:58.360 --> 02:32:00.840]
Well in this great right in the middle of the shoulder just coming in here

[02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:04.000]
As long as they got money for Camilla's house we don't mind the don't ever do it

[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.800]
Yeah we're gonna get a tape right for this just a hundred dollars

Tell me tell me tapes can we get a hundred bucks a hundred dollars right five tapes five tapes

[02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:14.980]
Five tapes alright five hundred how am I gonna know that though

Well I give you five tapes I guess right yeah that's it see he is he doesn't understand it

[02:32:20.820 --> 02:32:24.620]
He figured it out yeah we always like when the salespeople listen it's very good

Okay it's 143 and we got boy how much open lines does since you came in I don't know what happened

[02:32:30.220 --> 02:32:35.760]
In day 751 W-I-O-D and Broward 524 W-I-O-D

[02:32:35.760 --> 02:32:40.480]
We might just play something about ten minutes long here in Phyllis for the show it's unbelievable it's incredible

[02:32:40.480 --> 02:32:43.220]
I haven't done it already that's okay we understand

[02:32:43.900 --> 02:32:44.940]
Miami hello

[02:32:44.940 --> 02:32:49.380]
Hi I got a short story here for you from Lionel Playworld last night

[02:32:49.380 --> 02:32:56.020]
I'm trying to pick out some Christmas presents and I hear this young kid talking to this little older girl

[02:32:56.020 --> 02:33:03.780]
Carrying on about how he's a radio superstar and if she holds on to his co-tail so to speak he'll make her one awesome

[02:33:03.780 --> 02:33:11.560]
If he talks to Neil all the time and that Neil mentions him every day on the radio and I start laughing and you know

[02:33:11.560 --> 02:33:13.620]
Oh wait wait a minute wait a minute this is a Lionel Playworld

[02:33:13.620 --> 02:33:18.200]
Yeah couldn't have been STEM could have all if he had his little STEM on his shirt

[02:33:18.200 --> 02:33:21.200]
No bet he did you know I had to put it back where it belongs

[02:33:21.200 --> 02:33:30.360]
It was incredible it was I was in the midst of a superstar and I was I didn't know what to say

[02:33:31.420 --> 02:33:33.960]
You know what to say you should have just laughed out loud

[02:33:33.960 --> 02:33:38.360]
Well besides that and then the girl came over later and said if he's serious if you really on the radio

[02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:44.140]
I said yes am dial she says well what does STEM say and I said nothing that I can remember

[02:33:44.140 --> 02:33:45.800]
No nothing memorable whatsoever

[02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:53.380]
No and I'm working down here in Kendall and I'm paking down E-Mac and Bolly O's neon sign

[02:33:53.380 --> 02:33:56.120]
Really? Wait a minute were they in town and country?

[02:33:56.420 --> 02:33:59.360]
Yeah of course everybody went out in that place

[02:33:59.360 --> 02:34:04.380]
Yeah well now they have a new management and the same people that handle Bay sign

[02:34:04.380 --> 02:34:09.400]
It's a good looking shopping center but man you could have a bowling tournament and there with no problem

[02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:11.760]
There's nobody in the center

[02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:16.300]
But E-Mac and Bolly O's made a big mistake see they were up there in what is that really

[02:34:16.300 --> 02:34:20.700]
They made a lottery hell whatever that is and we had like twice we had 2000 people there

[02:34:20.700 --> 02:34:22.780]
They sold so much ice cream they almost ran out of it

[02:34:23.540 --> 02:34:26.500]
But they didn't want to advertise they were very tight with their bucks

[02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:30.980]
And they just didn't want to you know do anything to promote it and they were in a very that shopping center

[02:34:31.380 --> 02:34:35.500]
It's in receiverships matter of fact it's almost as desperate as the one you were talking about

[02:34:35.500 --> 02:34:37.420]
And they're long gone up there too

[02:34:37.420 --> 02:34:40.200]
I've got one of it I've got two questions real quick questions

[02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:45.160]
Yeah with everybody referring to on bird as Ed McMan does Ed McMan can Ed Jr

[02:34:45.160 --> 02:34:47.040]
Yeah I think that's a good idea

[02:34:48.140 --> 02:34:52.380]
Ed McMan Jr because we just say Ed Jr that could be our friend Ed and Fort Lauderdale

[02:34:52.380 --> 02:34:54.080]
Right I don't want to lump him in that category

[02:34:54.760 --> 02:34:59.900]
And then the other thing with the topics that Steve's been doing especially about the crutch watching

[02:34:59.900 --> 02:35:03.920]
That sounds very reminiscent of Stan's wearing your wife's underwear show

[02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:04.520]
Really?

[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:06.060]
That he criticized so much

[02:35:06.060 --> 02:35:10.340]
Well as a matter of fact on Mondays Steve's going to do a show about his wife wearing his underwear watching crutches

[02:35:10.340 --> 02:35:12.280]
Which is going to be mind boggling okay?

[02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:13.680]
Get down to more and more like Stan

[02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:15.480]
There you go don't tell him that

[02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:17.160]
Okay, good day

[02:35:18.220 --> 02:35:22.840]
145 at WIOD and here we are man I'm telling you just losing it are we here's another check

[02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:23.940]
Thank you very much Gary

[02:35:24.600 --> 02:35:26.960]
And the money just comes pouring in here huh?

[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:29.960]
Here's another 120 so let me just add that to our total

[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:32.920]
It's almost like the jury Lewis telephonic on his cigarettes

[02:35:35.980 --> 02:35:41.080]
4359 Monday were definitely going way over 15 grand right because I know that all the chiefs gates out there

[02:35:41.080 --> 02:35:42.700]
That's it knock off the beeper in here too

[02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:47.500]
Man he sales people they come in and just disrupt the whole goddamn show you know it's incredible

[02:35:47.500 --> 02:35:52.960]
But anyway like I said over the weekend I know that everybody will do their homework assignment including a lot of those old parts

[02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:54.160]
Like the ones who won the lottery

[02:35:55.520 --> 02:35:58.780]
Who want to plant that money in the ground with them when they go

[02:35:58.780 --> 02:36:01.860]
Instead of doing that why not each of those couples should take a grand

[02:36:01.860 --> 02:36:09.280]
That would be a nice round figure right five grand each one of those couples right at a thousand dollar check for Camila's house and mail it in over the weekend

[02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:11.320]
And we're not going to send him any tapes

[02:36:11.940 --> 02:36:15.240]
Because I don't think their pacemakers could take the shock okay from the tapes

[02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:18.380]
But that would be a very nice gesture in their parting moments

[02:36:18.940 --> 02:36:20.660]
Let's see Boko on five hello

[02:36:20.660 --> 02:36:22.520]
Hey Neil how you doing?

[02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:23.020]
Okay

[02:36:23.020 --> 02:36:27.440]
Hey Neil yesterday morning you had a caller who was going through a term-pike booth

[02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:31.740]
And you started talking about the problems you had when you got off the term-pike on sunrise boulevard

[02:36:31.740 --> 02:36:32.060]
Yeah

[02:36:32.060 --> 02:36:36.480]
I want to ask you did you recently start taking the term-pike in the afternoon on the way home?

[02:36:36.860 --> 02:36:37.620]
I always take it

[02:36:37.620 --> 02:36:42.320]
The reason I asked is I drive the truck and I go through that area every day and the last two days I've seen you

[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:46.660]
Yesterday I waved at you but I think you were so caught up in Steve's show that you were kind of oblivious to him

[02:36:46.660 --> 02:36:49.760]
Yeah I was listening to that Alan Becker and I was swearing at the radio

[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:51.380]
Yeah I don't blame you on that

[02:36:52.180 --> 02:36:55.620]
Listen I just want to give you some advice when you go through that area

[02:36:55.620 --> 02:37:01.380]
Yesterday I noticed you got up and back of a gravel truck and that's too nice of a car you drive to get in back of those dudes

[02:37:01.380 --> 02:37:03.800]
No let me tell you the big mistake I made okay

[02:37:04.240 --> 02:37:11.300]
Don't get in don't get in the lane where the blonde girl is you know because she has no interest in giving you the tickets

[02:37:11.300 --> 02:37:12.660]
This is a sunrise

[02:37:12.660 --> 02:37:16.000]
Wait a minute I'm thinking of the one where you get off I'm talking about where you get on

[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:16.520]
Okay

[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:19.460]
In other words where the golden blades is and you get on the term-pike

[02:37:19.460 --> 02:37:19.840]
Yeah

[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:22.460]
And all she's doing is just handing you out the ticket okay

[02:37:22.460 --> 02:37:22.780]
Yeah

[02:37:22.780 --> 02:37:27.800]
But she has no interest in that she's got a girl on the other side you know in each booth when they're both open

[02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:29.940]
There's you know somebody on one side somebody on the other

[02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:35.840]
This blonde girl she's not interested in doing a job she is a yin-tun all she went bap bap bap bap and she's having a personal conversation

[02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:40.160]
And she's like on an angle and she's basically facing the other girl

[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:44.140]
Paying no attention to the cars so like grudgingly as an afterthought

[02:37:44.140 --> 02:37:49.460]
She will give you the ticket if you stare it or long enough but somebody ought to just give her you know what for

[02:37:49.460 --> 02:37:50.780]
I mean she's out of her mind

[02:37:50.780 --> 02:37:56.540]
Yeah well I usually don't have problems the only problems I have when I'm getting off especially when I'm getting off the term-pike

[02:37:56.540 --> 02:38:01.320]
Are these people who get up and front yet and they pay and then they go through this long spiel with the girl right now

[02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:06.240]
Oh yeah I don't want to have a little chat yeah just like it to check out on the supermarket they won't have a little chat I know

[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:09.980]
I have no idea what they talk about I've never been able to figure that out

[02:38:09.980 --> 02:38:11.900]
Yeah I don't know what would you say about the-

[02:38:11.900 --> 02:38:13.820]
I can't think of what to say to a tall boo-hoo

[02:38:13.820 --> 02:38:21.280]
Most of my zinc gas for direction someplace that would take about a half hour to get a map you know get a map

[02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:26.180]
Yeah but anyway that's a pretty car you're driving I just want to warn you to stay away from the gravel trucks

[02:38:26.180 --> 02:38:28.980]
If I go down two especially around stay road 84 area

[02:38:28.980 --> 02:38:32.680]
Yeah they will bomb your car bad and I imagine the hood of a Corvette

[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:34.180]
It would do a number on it

[02:38:34.180 --> 02:38:36.020]
That would be worse than even spitting on my car right?

[02:38:36.140 --> 02:38:37.020]
That's exactly right

[02:38:37.020 --> 02:38:37.920]
Okay thanks a lot

[02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:38.700]
Okay Neil, bye

[02:38:39.580 --> 02:38:45.740]
149 at WIOD, Florida is here which ought to pacify these maniacs out here in the office who are just they're in heat

[02:38:45.740 --> 02:38:50.780]
They really are they're just going nuts and I think we'll take our last break here none too soon we'll come right back

[02:38:50.780 --> 02:38:55.280]
Oh boy here, boy good, boy good, boy good

[02:38:55.280 --> 02:38:56.900]
This is the king

[02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:04.760]
I don't have them in a row much for a while but I want y'all to know what up here in Rock and Roll head and all those thinking of you

[02:39:04.760 --> 02:39:11.500]
Christmas and right to give y'all a special Christmas message a message of peace

[02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:15.540]
Like how about a little piece of that pahagloon bar?

[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:16.740]
Like it, I got a mark

[02:39:16.740 --> 02:39:24.560]
A walk over a slam Christmas is a time of hoot, time of joy, a time of eleven

[02:39:25.140 --> 02:39:28.060]
And I sure would love it, takes life that feature you got there

[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:31.400]
Like it, but we're more or more like

[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:42.420]
Oh yeah Christmas, Christmas to me means family, if family means friends, the friends means getting together and getting together means eating

[02:39:42.980 --> 02:39:44.680]
I'll pass me that Thursday which place?

[02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:46.240]
Oh flaky, I got my mark

[02:39:47.980 --> 02:39:49.640]
Not just a little slate here right now

[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:56.240]
You know I may be a big star maybe too big but ain't nobody so big you can't reach out a helping hand

[02:39:57.060 --> 02:39:58.780]
I'm a helping hand

[02:39:58.780 --> 02:40:02.300]
Well would you hand me a helping of those mashed potatoes over there?

[02:40:02.580 --> 02:40:02.880]
Which I believe?

[02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:04.360]
Like it, like it am I

[02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:11.340]
Now like I was playing, ain't nobody so big you can't stoop to help a friend of neat over the holiday of this season

[02:40:12.180 --> 02:40:15.540]
Speaking of season, you won't pass me that soul-sucker when you get the chance

[02:40:15.540 --> 02:40:16.140]
Like it?

[02:40:16.380 --> 02:40:19.260]
Yeah, just don't screw the cover, that's right, like it, like it will not

[02:40:19.860 --> 02:40:23.440]
So this Christmas, why don't y'all take a tip from old A.O.

[02:40:24.580 --> 02:40:27.300]
Now I'll leave those steak-tiff right where they are, you know what I mean?

[02:40:27.440 --> 02:40:28.460]
No, I appreciate it, thank you

[02:40:28.460 --> 02:40:32.260]
I want you to remember for all part of God's great big family

[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:35.080]
You know God made man unto his own image

[02:40:35.540 --> 02:40:40.580]
And look at the mirror, I'd have to say God must be a big big sin of a gun, you know what I mean?

[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:41.780]
I think you do

[02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:44.940]
But I especially want y'all to remember this one last thing

[02:40:44.940 --> 02:40:49.460]
When y'all this homeless Christmas springing that popcorn up on the tree

[02:40:50.420 --> 02:40:52.660]
Save a big, big bowl for the can

[02:40:53.340 --> 02:40:54.640]
Extra butter, don't I mean?

[02:40:55.120 --> 02:40:57.180]
Like you do, like you do, like you do, like you do

[02:40:58.020 --> 02:41:03.340]
You know we just had some exciting news, Steve tells me that they're right on the verge of cementing

[02:41:03.340 --> 02:41:04.320]
So to speak

[02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:05.460]
So to speak

[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:09.260]
And that the end of January looks like the big day

[02:41:09.260 --> 02:41:11.400]
Now you want the thing you didn't realize among his many talents

[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:15.900]
And we do have the awesome Jeff Striker head here, which is incredible

[02:41:15.900 --> 02:41:19.480]
They're selling some paraphernalia, which are, which we'll talk about at a future date

[02:41:20.020 --> 02:41:23.600]
But he's also, yeah, but he's also a tremendous talent

[02:41:26.380 --> 02:41:28.740]
There's the like the way that that is done here at the beginning

[02:41:31.460 --> 02:41:34.120]
We don't have time for the whole thing, but just a little piece

[02:41:45.900 --> 02:41:48.260]
And I'm gonna find this thing and then I'll come inside

[02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:58.020]
Could I know what I'm gonna want that I can now

[02:41:58.020 --> 02:42:01.900]
And I'm a man who's gonna come home to me

[02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:08.520]
Be a man, be a man, I'm on my way

[02:42:12.260 --> 02:42:14.360]
Be a man, be a man, be a man, be a man

[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:17.180]
I'm on my way

[02:42:17.180 --> 02:42:21.400]
Be a man, be a man, be a man, be a man, be a man

[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:25.740]
Be a man, be a man, be a man, be a man

[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:28.900]
So anyways, I said, you're on a hidden talent there

[02:42:28.900 --> 02:42:31.940]
And we don't want to let the whole cat out of the bag, but that's gonna be quite a show

[02:42:31.940 --> 02:42:34.140]
And I may stick around for a little bit of that, you know what I'm saying?

[02:42:34.620 --> 02:42:35.580]
Tell about six

[02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:40.600]
So anyway, we're almost at the end of the line, not too soon this last hour

[02:42:40.600 --> 02:42:44.540]
This week, not every day, but a couple of days, boys, really been peculiar, you know

[02:42:44.540 --> 02:42:47.140]
Alright, now don't forget you got a lot of work to do over the weekend

[02:42:47.140 --> 02:42:51.240]
And I realize a lot of people are already busy like with the Christmas shopping and stuff like that

[02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:54.680]
All you should already have it done, but most people don't

[02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:57.360]
But what we would like is our own little gift to you from the New York Roger Show

[02:42:57.360 --> 02:43:00.520]
To send you your very own boon in the box and it's absolutely free

[02:43:00.520 --> 02:43:03.920]
You don't even supply the envelope, so okay, because this company's got so much money

[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:05.440]
It's about time they start spreading it around

[02:43:06.140 --> 02:43:12.180]
And just send your name and address on a card or a letter to boon in the box, Caronil Rogers, WIOD

[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:15.000]
Miami-33141

[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:19.480]
And you will see Pat as you have never quite seen him before thanks to Hustler Magazine

[02:43:19.480 --> 02:43:21.600]
Very festive, very Christmas-like

[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:22.800]
Yeah, I like that

[02:43:22.800 --> 02:43:25.980]
Yeah, it certainly is a perfect for the holiday season

[02:43:25.980 --> 02:43:29.660]
And then of course the other thing, and now do I have to go through that whole thing again?

[02:43:29.660 --> 02:43:32.020]
Exactly, because set quickly, it's only three steps

[02:43:32.940 --> 02:43:35.100]
Only three, you think they can handle it?

[02:43:35.120 --> 02:43:37.100]
Three quick easy simple steps

[02:43:37.100 --> 02:43:37.460]
Yeah

[02:43:37.460 --> 02:43:40.380]
Even I understand this, now that should tell you

[02:43:40.380 --> 02:43:42.040]
Yeah, if he can understand it

[02:43:42.040 --> 02:43:43.080]
Even I could explain it

[02:43:43.080 --> 02:43:45.160]
Any knee-and-rithole out there ought to be able to follow through

[02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:45.600]
Exactly

[02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:50.440]
And this is just another little incentive to get some of you cheapskates to donate money for the Camilla House and the homeless

[02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:53.060]
And that is to make out a check, 20 bucks or more

[02:43:53.060 --> 02:43:54.880]
And a lot of people have been sending more and that's great

[02:43:55.680 --> 02:43:59.680]
And make it out to Camilla House and then get us a 90-minute cassette

[02:43:59.680 --> 02:44:01.580]
Like a set, that's step two

[02:44:01.580 --> 02:44:04.320]
And then step three, a stamped self-adreast envelope

[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:06.580]
Which is not mandatory, but it would certainly help

[02:44:06.580 --> 02:44:08.140]
It makes our life a lot easier that way

[02:44:08.140 --> 02:44:13.300]
And just send that to us and then we'll take your tape and we'll double all the goodies on here on one side

[02:44:13.300 --> 02:44:15.220]
45 minutes of bits and stuff

[02:44:15.220 --> 02:44:16.980]
And all kinds of a wonderful crap

[02:44:17.540 --> 02:44:19.040]
And we'll mail it back to you

[02:44:19.040 --> 02:44:21.300]
Yeah, and if you can close an envelope, you should get it quicker

[02:44:21.300 --> 02:44:22.300]
It should expediate

[02:44:23.740 --> 02:44:24.660]
What do you say?

[02:44:24.980 --> 02:44:26.120]
Well, it's almost like those old days

[02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:27.420]
Almost like a brief newscast

[02:44:27.420 --> 02:44:30.860]
And just mail it to NeoRodges, WIOD, Miami

[02:44:30.860 --> 02:44:32.000]
There's that address again

[02:44:33.060 --> 02:44:33.780]
331-41

[02:44:34.380 --> 02:44:34.740]
Okay?

[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:35.200]
Yeah

[02:44:36.300 --> 02:44:36.660]
Excellent

[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:38.620]
Well, that's going to do it for us

[02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:40.700]
We hope you have a marvelous weekend in a great life

[02:44:40.700 --> 02:44:44.340]
And all those folks up there in that horrible place at Viewpoint

[02:44:45.820 --> 02:44:46.180]
Viewpoint?

[02:44:46.500 --> 02:44:47.180]
Is that the name of it?

[02:44:47.220 --> 02:44:47.960]
Is it? That's how it works

[02:44:47.960 --> 02:44:49.260]
And Margate, good luck to you

[02:44:49.260 --> 02:44:49.540]
Okay?

[02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:52.300]
Hope you have a real clear conscience during this holiday season

[02:44:52.940 --> 02:44:54.500]
Compassion and love and brotherhood

[02:44:54.500 --> 02:44:57.720]
And made the bird of paradise do it all over your face

[02:44:57.720 --> 02:44:58.160]
Okay?

[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:00.480]
Steve has opened phones next from two to six

[02:45:00.480 --> 02:45:01.780]
Hankwood Sports Talk at six

[02:45:01.780 --> 02:45:03.200]
And Hurricane Basketball tonight

[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:04.080]
Have a good one

[02:45:04.080 --> 02:45:05.260]
We'll see you Monday morning at 10

[02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:07.460]
Here on 610-WIOD
