[00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.060]
As telephone conversations, yes, it's the Elvis tapes.

[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.140]
Hello, baby. This is Elvis.

[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.100]
And I want you to come over right now and make me a big peanut butter and then a sandwich.

[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.160]
A big little butter and then a sandwich, where they're dripping me through with the day.

[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.280]
You'll hear Elvis in his most intimate moments.

[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.640]
Hello, piece of mail, piece of mail.

[00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.740]
Yes, this is the Elvis.

[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.080]
Won't you bring me over?

[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.620]
A couple large paws.

[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.820]
Don't make it, make it three.

[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.260]
Don't make it sex, double cheese.

[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.460]
Yeah, I'm hungry.

[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.280]
I'm alone.

[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.480]
And I'm hungry.

[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.060]
And you'll hear Elvis reveal how he really feels about the one true love of his life.

[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.760]
Won't you back, won't you back, I'm a lot of baby.

[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.980]
And I don't do way back.

[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.200]
Would you pick up some donuts, please?

[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.440]
Make jelly cream donuts.

[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.760]
Crullest Jimmy's day this two.

[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.940]
All of my baby honey glies donuts.

[00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.760]
Without them, I can't do.

[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.500]
The Elvis taste.

[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.400]
Give me, give me, give me, give me more donuts.

[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.360]
Available now. We've run stores everywhere.

[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.760]
I want to eat. I want to eat lemon, lemon to do.

[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.480]
I get a big part of this.

[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.240]
It's the Neil Rogers show.

[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.820]
I'm Cedar Four.

[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.960]
How come you guys lost yesterday?

[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.660]
Oh, my question.

[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.760]
L.U.R. on vacation.

[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.660]
I knew there had to be a logical explanation.

[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.440]
The Michigan got kind of warm.

[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.560]
Well, he gets around, doesn't he?

[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.960]
Doesn't he?

[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.080]
Yeah, Michigan got hot up there, didn't he?

[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.440]
Well, great to hear from you, Elvis.

[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.620]
I'm pretty sure this is a loo.

[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.140]
You're a man.

[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.320]
What I want to do is sleep.

[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.440]
You got to sleep and eat.

[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.680]
It's like you have me.

[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.440]
Elvis is everywhere, man.

[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.980]
He's in everything.

[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.480]
He's in everybody.

[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.280]
Elvis is in your jeans.

[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.220]
He's in your cheeseburgers.

[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.140]
Elvis is in nutty buddies.

[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.960]
Elvis is in your mom.

[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.640]
He's in everybody.

[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.440]
He's in the young old, the fat skinny.

[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.460]
The white, the black, the brown, and the blue.

[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.980]
People got Elvis in them too.

[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.180]
Elvis is in everybody out there.

[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.140]
Everybody's got Elvis in them.

[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.360]
Everybody except one person, that is.

[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.960]
Yeah, one person.

[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.680]
The evil opposite of Elvis.

[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.220]
The N.T. Elvis.

[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.500]
N.T. Elvis got no Elvis in them.

[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.120]
Let me tell you.

[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.840]
Michael J. Fox has no Elvis in him.

[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.560]
Yeah, and Elvis is in Joan Rivers.

[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.680]
But he's trying to get out, man.

[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.400]
He's trying to get out.

[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.440]
Listen up, Johnny, baby.

[00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.520]
Elvis is everywhere.

[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.980]
Elvis is in everything.

[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.400]
Elvis is in everybody.

[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.240]
Elvis is still the king.

[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.000]
And only one I want you to sleep.

[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.540]
That would be easy to die to give in to you.

[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.300]
Wow.

[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.120]
Man, there's a lot of unexplained phenomenon out there in the world.

[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.660]
A lot of things people say.

[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.040]
What the heck's going on?

[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.460]
Let me tell you.

[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.760]
Who built the pyramid?

[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.720]
Elvis.

[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.080]
Who built stone?

[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.760]
Elvis.

[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.640]
Yeah, man, you see guys walking in the street, pushing shopping carts.

[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.500]
And they think they're talking to Allah.

[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.040]
They're talking to themselves, man.

[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.800]
No, they're talking to Elvis.

[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.020]
Elvis.

[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.980]
Elvis.

[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.540]
You know what's going on?

[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.800]
That promoter triangle.

[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.440]
Down the promoter triangle.

[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.560]
Elvis needs votes.

[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.760]
Elvis needs votes.

[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.320]
Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis.

[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.160]
Elvis needs votes.

[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.360]
Ah, the saline Elvis.

[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.280]
Captain Elvis.

[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.340]
Commodore Elvis.

[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.080]
It is.

[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.120]
Damn, man.

[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.560]
You know, people from outer space.

[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.780]
People from outer space, they come up to me.

[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.420]
They don't look like Dr. Spock.

[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.200]
They don't look like clean-ons.

[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.500]
All that star-tracked job.

[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.740]
They look like Elvis.

[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.060]
Elvis.

[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.520]
Everybody in outer space looks like Elvis.

[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.260]
Because Elvis is a perfect being.

[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.560]
We're all moving to perfect peace and harmony towards Elvis.

[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.220]
Soon, all will become Elvis.

[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.920]
Everything, everywhere will be Elvis.

[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.200]
Why do you think they call it evolution anyway?

[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.620]
It's really Elvis.

[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.320]
Lotion.

[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.880]
Elvis.

[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.540]
Lotion.

[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.220]
Elvis is everywhere.

[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.660]
Elvis is everything.

[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.160]
Elvis is everybody.

[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.940]
Elvis is still the king.

[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.560]
I don't know how I want to see the king.

[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.200]
Not you and me.

[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.000]
Elvis is everywhere.

[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.460]
Elvis is everything.

[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.980]
Elvis is everybody.

[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.300]
Elvis is still the king.

[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.440]
I don't know how I want to see the king.

[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.740]
It's gotta be him.

[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.840]
It's gonna be him.

[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.180]
Oh, great, I never heard that skip roll.

[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.340]
What are you doing?

[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.780]
Okay.

[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.620]
The wife left town with a banana.

[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.740]
Loads are rotten deal.

[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.500]
I found that y'all devil hiding in her purse.

[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.340]
He's cold and he's hard, but he's gotta pee.

[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.180]
I hope it never happens to you.

[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.300]
Some fruit breaks your marriage into.

[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.660]
My wife left town with a banana.

[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.940]
My baby slipped out of the way.

[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.880]
Müzik

[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.580]
The wife left town with a banana.

[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.200]
I'm a jealous man.

[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.720]
She found us six inch Latin Lover.

[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.740]
Now she does the tango with her right hand'.

[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:17.940]
right now I could just die. He's eaten my banana cream pie, my wife left down, my

[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:24.780]
banana, my baby's slipping, my baby's slipping, my baby's slipping away.

[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.200]
Although I think she's still working because...

[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.100]
Okay, and now listen, I got a great suggestion. Naturally, the management types there

[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.360]
never take any suggestions. We know that. Right.

[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.160]
But I got a great suggestion on how to make Zeta the number one station in the whole market

[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:47.900]
all day long. Okay, okay, a lineup. Neil in the morning, Captain Dave in the bird, mid-day.

[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.180]
Stan and Johnny Dark in the afternoon.

[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.320]
Incredible. Never happen, sir. It will never happen, sir.

[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.200]
Am I right? Would it be incredible?

[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.160]
No, it would be interesting, fascinating suggestion.

[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.300]
Great suggestion. Okay, one more thing.

[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.220]
Thing is Neil can't work by himself.

[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.560]
You don't think so? No. Not in your line.

[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.820]
Are you kidding? Oh, I need you to say that.

[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.540]
Well, let me let me let me let me let me

[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.520]
in college. Let me say more because I didn't mean that literally. He's spinning in his

[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.120]
lay right now. I didn't mean that literally, okay?

[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.960]
I mean he wouldn't want to come back to haunt you. He wouldn't want to work by himself.

[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.140]
It's what I meant to say. You don't think so?

[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.980]
I think when Neil's by himself even gets more crazy.

[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.540]
Yeah, because I remember from the AM when he used to just go not to the high school.

[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.960]
Did you hear yesterday 9 to 10?

[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.860]
Oh, he was great.

[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:35.840]
Wasn't that incredible?

[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.000]
Oh, it was just the old Neil back.

[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.240]
It was, wasn't it? It was just it was absolutely the old Neil.

[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.080]
Yeah, I think this last temptation to Christ things really get them crazy.

[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.120]
Maybe a little bit. Oh, yeah, we got a story on it.

[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.880]
And one other thing, I know you all don't take requests.

[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:51.460]
Right.

[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.860]
Could it have been any longer?

[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:54.660]
Yeah. Okay.

[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.880]
Well, we played a couple of jingles.

[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.000]
Yeah, I think that kind of followed.

[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.600]
Why don't you run a jingle while I'm doing this one too?

[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.860]
It's 430 and swinging on the Chuck Benson show.

[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.360]
It's time to go.

[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.700]
I like it.

[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.720]
That's two two hours.

[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.540]
It'll be time to go.

[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.040]
But the classic rock block party starts today at noon.

[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.840]
Rock blocks from your favorite classic artists all weekend.

[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.160]
Long.

[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.780]
It's right from right here at classic rock K-O-N-O.

[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.180]
94.984.

[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.220]
8 o'clock.

[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.980]
And data for WZTA Miami Beach.

[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.360]
Candy dark.

[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.000]
Sixty-six.

[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.880]
Nobody's in your beta.

[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.620]
We have them all.

[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.080]
Bring it back.

[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:46.760]
Those good memories.

[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.440]
We have any jingle you want to hear.

[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.080]
I found a one card to this.

[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.640]
Got a T.I.A.

[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.780]
Finding all kinds of stuff on cards here.

[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.900]
You could probably find Johnny Dark jingles at other radio stations too.

[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:56.980]
Yeah.

[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:57.620]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.820]
All right, let's go.

[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.020]
Candy dark.

[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.520]
Sixty-six.

[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:03.820]
WNBC.

[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.440]
We just love that.

[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.940]
You know, we just can't get enough of it.

[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.320]
Now, did you used to run that between records or after the news or what did you do?

[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.500]
Coming out of a stop set.

[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.600]
You know, one stop that ends.

[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:17.860]
I really missed this summer.

[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.800]
And I tried to find it in the Pam's jingles that I found at my mom's house and all.

[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.280]
Oh, yeah.

[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.300]
It's time to turn things that we turn before you burn.

[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:25.860]
They were great.

[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:26.180]
Yeah.

[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.780]
It's time to turn.

[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.420]
Now, I have something weird on that.

[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.240]
I'll wait it.

[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:30.900]
Yeah, this.

[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.800]
That would be found while we were cleaning up the cards this morning speaking of TAN-A.

[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.840]
Went down to the ocean to get myself tan.

[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.720]
Didn't bring no lotion.

[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.740]
I'm too much of a man.

[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.980]
Let me tell you baby, baby.

[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.360]
Better leave me alone.

[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.840]
I'm too much of a sunscreen.

[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.300]
I'm burned to the bone.

[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.880]
Burn to the bone.

[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.400]
To-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to burn,

[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.740]
Burn to the bone.

[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.240]
I walk on the beach.

[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.700]
Men step aside.

[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.380]
He's read as a beat they say.

[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.480]
This guy's really fried.

[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.060]
That looks really painful.

[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.600]
This fool should go home.

[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:41.020]
Yeah, but hey, pretty my mom, I'm burned to the bone, burned to the bone, burned to the bone, burned to the bone, don't touch me.

[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:53.540]
When I walked down the street, they all stopped and stared. This ain't just a sunburn, this is medium rare.

[00:10:53.540 --> 00:11:14.060]
I'm thoroughly baked, babe, just like a calzone, let me tell you pretty, baby, I'm burned to the bone, burned to the bone, burned to the bone, burned to the bone, burned to the bone.

[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.460]
Oh, man, you can tell I got a few.

[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:26.280]
Remember that? That's great. That's good, isn't it? I like it, I like the bluesies.

[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.740]
Now I found this also, and this is just, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:38.460]
This portion of our show is brought to you by the new Volkswagen Roger Rabbit.

[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:46.580]
Keep your car tuned with the car that's a tune, the car tune car, the VW Roger Rabbit.

[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.860]
Nah, not much to that, is it? I've never heard it, have you?

[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:58.780]
You ever heard it? Yeah, when Neil played on real estate, Neil told John Ford to dub stuff off that ACN, and I think he dubbed off everything.

[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.700]
I know what some of this stuff is, oh, we don't even know, let's see what this is.

[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.520]
Oh, yeah, sure. Here comes, here comes Wendy.

[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.700]
This is Gaffelda and the fish or something. Sure.

[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.820]
Oh, yeah, we need that, okay. All right, let's go to a call.

[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:19.360]
Well, we do. Well, you know how Neil previews the, uh, sometimes you can do it.

[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:24.360]
You're so sneaky about it. You know, the word from the bird, we're calling this, uh, what's happening with the cap?

[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.600]
Where is the cap, then anyway?

[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:34.080]
Well, you know, on a day like today, kind of a muggy morning, you start thinking about what happened in the past on this day.

[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:41.480]
Oh, and it was on this day in 1970 that Janice Joplin played what proved to be her final concert at Harvard University in Boston.

[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:47.160]
I didn't know that. And, uh, she was found dead two months later from Odin on that bad stuff.

[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.320]
I mean, it didn't happen like it did in the movie where she just collapsed on stage and that was it.

[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:56.860]
Well, the movie I saw about her life, she was like in a car chase scene at the end and all these terrorists were like, she dead.

[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.660]
The Hollywood version of her death.

[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.080]
The lap.

[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:10.380]
I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna stop. I don't know what to say.

[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:19.480]
I'm going to stop. I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna stop.

[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:24.600]
I'm going to stop. I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna stop. I don't know what.

[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.380]
Stir from here.

[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:31.480]
She's the high-freakster TV news.

[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:32.660]
Bishop.

[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.540]
All right, the high bishop of TV news.

[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.240]
She's anger with a whip.

[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:42.160]
Ah!

[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:43.240]
Ah!

[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:50.320]
That steady gaze, that imposing figure,

[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.120]
that frightened me more.

[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:54.840]
What else?

[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.900]
It must be anger with a whip.

[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:02.400]
Ah!

[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:05.160]

[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.240]
So, so sorry.

[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.420]
I do well, Lather.

[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:12.160]
It's below the death.

[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.900]
What do you know?

[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.540]
Anger with a whip.

[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.780]
I do well, Lather.

[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.520]
It's below the death.

[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.140]
You know, taking care of your lawn these days,

[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.860]
sure seems complicated.

[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.700]
Big trucks, fancy service contracts,

[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.120]
dangerous chemicals.

[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.520]
You know, all seems so complicated.

[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:49.520]

[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:49.520]

[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:49.520]

[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:49.520]

[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.880]
So unnecessary, especially now,

[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.300]
when you can call on something as easy and natural as Kim Dog.

[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.640]
Each week, the Kim Dog will personally inspect your lawn.

[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.680]
For weeds and crabgrass,

[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.400]
he'll spray liquid formula number one.

[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.460]
And for those patches where grass just don't seem to grow,

[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.680]
your Kim Dog will apply a special layer of formula number two.

[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.400]
Oh, boy, watch your step.

[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.580]
That's all natural fertilizer.

[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.460]
So if your lawn's looking kind of shaggy,

[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.160]
unleash the Kim Dog.

[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.960]
We may not be the best, but we sure got a leg up on the competition.

[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.860]
Oh, not on my shoe.

[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:32.680]
Kim Dog!

[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.920]
Kim Dog!

[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:37.980]
Oh, my foot.

[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.780]
Just sit right back and you'll hear it.

[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.880]
A tale, a tale of a fateful trip.

[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.640]
About two dudes with a fish and pole

[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.300]
and a joint aboard their ship.

[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.100]
The sky was clear, the air was fresh.

[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.080]
The ocean looks so fine.

[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.680]
But some folks were about to,

[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.620]
and their day before they dropped a line.

[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.020]
A co-scarchip was bearing down with nothing else to do.

[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.680]
In search of roaches or some dust,

[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.520]
while tons of coke got through.

[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.180]
Turn round.

[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.040]
Hands in the air, your fish and trip is through.

[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.400]
The dude lost everything they had for just some residue.

[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.280]
The co-scarchoned the boat to port.

[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.060]
They got that's on the back.

[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.880]
A million bucks meant for one joint.

[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.540]
While the city choked on crack.

[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.480]
So keep this little tune in mind.

[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.000]
Remember what it meant.

[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.460]
The task force has to fake results till Bush is president.

[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.380]
The coast guard pierced full of ships.

[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.920]
The owners lost their butts for taking more than beer along.

[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:48.140]
Here on Governance Cuts.

[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.200]
Well, I look, I could see the numbers in the other.

[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.580]
Now, come on, play this.

[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.100]
This will get everyone in the mood to guess.

[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.840]
Let's, let's, come on.

[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.180]
It's great though.

[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:00.880]
Didn't it?

[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.200]
Jada Ford.

[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.520]
641.

[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.100]
Good morning to you.

[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:13.740]
Oh.

[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.320]
Take a breather.

[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.660]
I'd like to meet take a breather.

[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:22.100]
Where is it time to eat take a breather?

[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.660]
I don't mean it him.

[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.080]
He isn't food.

[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.660]
Although I know some guys.

[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.440]
Wood.

[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.260]
Perse.

[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:33.920]
What do I see?

[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:40.060]
Is that home in touch for me?

[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.300]
No Ford take a breather.

[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.280]
I got one other thing.

[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.360]
There's another radio station that asks for good questions.

[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.240]
And I got one.

[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.960]
If you crack a quick brush can he still have any children?

[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:54.380]
Yeah.

[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:56.780]
We've heard this.

[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.600]
How about can you die from hearing age?

[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.180]
Yeah.

[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.420]
Well, I saw, speaking of the cock as I saw him seeing in over the weekend,

[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.200]
they got a shirt in New Orleans and it says,

[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.420]
do cock-eye happens?

[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:08.960]
You heard about that?

[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:10.900]
Yeah.

[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:12.680]
Thanks a lot.

[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.120]
Lots of funny jokes.

[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.340]
Would you bring me here?

[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.580]
And we do have the news beds now.

[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:18.320]
How about your mama?

[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.080]
Yeah, okay.

[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:19.960]
I'd like to hear that.

[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:21.640]
Don't you?

[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:21.960]

[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.060]
We don't hear your mama too much.

[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.080]
It's 750 on Zeta 4.

[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.440]
I am up.

[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.800]
Stevie Nicks, the distinctive voice of Fleetwood Mac.

[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.060]
Her style is unforgettable.

[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.860]
Her lyrics are unintelligible.

[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.420]
Stevie's back with all your favorite hits on one big album.

[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.860]
It's Stevie Nicks.

[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.160]
What the hell is she saying?

[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:10.720]
Yes, all her classics are here.

[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.560]
You'll get me, me, and the incomparable.

[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:28.940]
Do da la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.360]
Gigitally remembers or stereo inaudibility.

[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.220]
This is Stevie Nicks, at her most nebulous.

[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.880]
Stevie Nicks, what the hell is she saying?

[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.400]
Available now on incoherent records and tapes.

[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.360]
Night.

[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.180]
Don't miss, close out.

[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.160]
KC's come and's been held down.

[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.500]
Hello, America.

[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.480]
This is KC.

[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.440]
And every week on my coast to coast commandment countdown,

[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.160]
I'll tell you how many of the top 10 commandments

[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.440]
Jim and Tammy Baker have broken so far.

[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.740]
In just one month, they've shattered number nine,

[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.720]
number eight, number seven, and number six,

[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.320]
making them the most sinful couple since Saddam and Gamora.

[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.320]
And now they're shooting for commandment number five.

[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.540]
Isn't that right, Tammy?

[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:15.620]
That's right, KC.

[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.580]
It's time to make your mic, huh?

[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.860]
Oh, well, there goes number five with a bullet.

[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.000]
A 38 caliber.

[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.020]
Yes, I've been shot through the heart and you're the blame.

[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.500]
I gave PTA, Alabama.

[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.100]
For sure, for sure.

[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.960]
KC's come and's been held down.

[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.760]
I think this is, this calls for you, Captain Dave.

[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:36.740]
Hello.

[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:37.620]
Hello.

[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:38.180]
Hi.

[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.960]
It's a great show, but a little too boring.

[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.400]
A little too boring.

[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.120]
It's just trying hard.

[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.000]
What?

[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.040]
Your turn?

[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.840]
I'm not trying too hard.

[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.040]
Yes, yes you are.

[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.540]
No, I'm not doing anything, ma'am.

[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.300]
What's your good?

[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:53.940]
You're good.

[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:54.940]
I like you, Glenn.

[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.440]
Now, do you think I'm struggling?

[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:57.240]
Yeah.

[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.080]
Can you tell it in my voice?

[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.560]
No, Glenn, you're good.

[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.180]
You really should be a bit manning the show.

[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.440]
Thank you, ma'am.

[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:06.620]
Go.

[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.460]
There she goes.

[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.140]
That's it.

[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.700]
Yeah, you know who that was, right?

[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.740]
You're struggling.

[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.120]
You're struggling.

[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.240]
I can tell it in your voice.

[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.100]
What is he saying?

[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.620]
I'm trying too hard.

[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.660]
Dave, I'm not doing anything.

[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.940]
I'm sitting here.

[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.720]
One thing we've never tried.

[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.880]
We don't try to.

[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.360]
I'm like going with the flow.

[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.280]
No, this business.

[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.220]
Whatever happens, you know?

[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:34.220]
I wonder if the times I've been in radio have I ever really tried too hard.

[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.140]
She said the show was boring, and we were trying too hard.

[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.360]
Well, last hour, we liked you.

[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.560]
But she likes us a lot.

[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.980]
Last hour we had Ed.

[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.920]
Wow, okay.

[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.720]
This has really been something, hasn't it?

[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.500]
Hollywood next.

[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:49.960]
Hello.

[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.020]
Everything's fine.

[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.360]
It's just...

[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.800]
I'm not struggling.

[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.280]
It's Burj Jr.

[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.440]
As long as I have my slights of pizza.

[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.060]
Tell that lady everything.

[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.560]
Fine, just fine.

[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.660]
Two lads.

[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:14.900]
Oh, no.

[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.640]
Now this time I had my little spontaneous bit I was going to play for you.

[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.980]
And Camden Dave punched it and it went away.

[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:24.620]
I'll have to play.

[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.900]
We got to wait for it to recue now.

[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:27.920]
It's going to take forever.

[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:28.840]
And it's...

[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.380]
Everything's fine.

[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.200]
And it's real long.

[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.240]
And it's...

[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.960]
You say, cat and Dave.

[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.620]
Oh, here we...

[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:39.860]
Wait.

[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.680]
All right.

[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:41.780]
You're playing this one.

[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.220]
No, no, no.

[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.020]
Play this one.

[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:46.540]
All right.

[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:47.500]
This will...

[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.440]
This will be...

[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.200]
This will fit in with that last call.

[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.580]
Just trust me, okay?

[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.420]
Just hit it.

[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.180]
And put it in mono.

[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:55.980]
I'll do it.

[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.600]
The fantastic,

[00:22:58.840 --> 00:22:59.800]
Dushky brothers.

[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:02.100]
Rotted.

[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.160]
Clint.

[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.800]
And so faster.

[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.900]
Are you ready, boys?

[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.800]
You're absolutely...

[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.620]
Yeah.

[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.760]
You ready?

[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.100]
Yeah.

[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.200]

[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.200]

[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:24.520]
I don't know.

[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:29.700]
Let's outdo the Glenn Hill.

[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:31.480]
Hold down.

[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.940]
One, two, three.

[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:36.000]
Oh.

[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.660]
The birdie.

[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:37.780]

[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:37.780]

[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:37.780]

[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:37.780]

[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:37.780]

[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:37.780]

[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:37.780]

[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:37.780]

[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:37.780]

[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:37.780]

[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:37.780]

[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.120]
He's back and you're gonna hear him cackle.

[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.920]
He loves, he loves, the birdies.

[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.520]
You read the news,

[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.160]
but you can bet it won't be factual.

[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:53.540]
He loves, he loves, the birdies.

[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.940]
The birdies back.

[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.340]
He just flew out of his closet.

[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.980]
He loves, he loves, the birdies.

[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.680]
And on your car,

[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.900]
he will leave you his deposit.

[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.920]
He loves, he loves, the birdies back.

[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:11.720]
Yeah.

[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.740]
You might say that he's in my brain.

[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.740]
But he never stole the fricking.

[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.840]
Every time he reads news,

[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.240]
he gets himself a trouble.

[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:24.260]

[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.620]
But Neil is always right there.

[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.540]
First thing has a bubble.

[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:32.260]
Oh.

[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.620]
Listen and see,

[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.920]
the bird is back.

[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.180]
I heard that it's official.

[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.440]
He loves, he loves, the birdies.

[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.760]
But next week they're gonna send it to a senter real ritual.

[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.420]
He loves, he loves, the birdies back.

[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:54.620]
All right.

[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.280]
Let's hit it, boys.

[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.040]
I still haven't got it.

[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.880]
Carol says pull out play and board

[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.860]
or definitely do a backuation of the piece agreement

[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.660]
suggested it may rather do a valuation to the piece agreement.

[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:14.960]
What was it?

[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.320]
Immaculation or evaluation?

[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.300]
I'm sorry, it's a back-and-evaliation.

[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.060]
Is it a piece agreement?

[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.640]
And it will feature highlights from a thousand,

[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.480]
a secret tape recorder.

[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:38.600]
And the CIA would have to assess the country.

[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.160]
Or assess the country.

[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.860]
New vote?

[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.580]
New vote.

[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.220]
New wave vote.

[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.380]
1920s movie star and cancer graduate,

[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.880]
thrower Oh buddy Roger

[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.560]
Jesus.

[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.940]
Yeah, the part is back.

[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:12.180]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the part is back.

[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.880]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.960]
the parts is back.

[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.560]
The part is back.

[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:24.940]
YoS...

[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:25.460]
Yeah.

[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.160]
That's really weird.

[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.520]
Weird to hear that's a Glen Hill polka.

[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.340]
Did you haven't heard it in a while?

[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:33.840]
He's big.

[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.060]
He's bad and he wants you.

[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.980]
Say I am some botan.

[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.160]
He's a street wise cop by night.

[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.720]
Say you are under arrest.

[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.080]
And our presidential candidate by day.

[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.040]
Don't be no two.

[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.220]
Get in that old roof.

[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.380]
Karl Weathers is action, Jesse Jackson.

[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:57.920]
Either I'm ramen on the stump or I'm busting up some thick newspapers, couples intoxicated

[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.480]
by their togetherness sharing precious waking moments.

[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.700]
You'll see that I seek, but I also want to put out Jimmetha Green.

[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.580]
Action, Jesse Jackson coming soon to a primary near you.

[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.300]
It's a...

[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.260]
It's a...

[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:18.520]
It's a...

[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:18.620]
It's a...

[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:18.660]
It's a...

[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:18.900]
It's a...

[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:18.900]

[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:19.660]
It's a...

[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:20.980]
It's a...

[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:21.620]
It's a...

[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.360]
It's a...

[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:11.860]
and it was just a weather balloon.

[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.960]
I saw Elvis and Burger King knew that any went in

[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.800]
and was very hostile on his way on.

[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.540]

[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.660]

[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:20.560]
Hey, man.

[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.220]
What do you mean there's no F and F?

[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:22.740]
Banner.

[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:24.080]
Pick me a letter.

[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.780]
No one does it any better.

[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.300]
I dream about you.

[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:27.860]
Hey, banner.

[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.320]
Is that an all over town or what?

[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:29.880]
Banner.

[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.760]
I don't understand why you make a hundred grand.

[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.920]
Not for me to say.

[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:35.360]
Anyway.

[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.500]
Get me a ticket for an aeroplane.

[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.920]
Gonna be on the Wheel of Fortune game.

[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.940]
I just got to win.

[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.480]
Spin the wheel again.

[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:46.340]
Oh, banner.

[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:47.780]
Pick me a letter.

[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.180]
Go, banner.

[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:49.700]
Go baby.

[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.460]
Go, arise.

[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.680]
Hey, get out of my face, Pat.

[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:53.880]
Is that a two-way?

[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:55.960]
Is there an L in that word?

[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:57.040]
Is it a low rider?

[00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:58.680]
All right, no buyer.

[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.840]
Forget the letter, man.

[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.600]
I'll take banner while you're beautiful, baby.

[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.020]
You and me could play the home game.

[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:06.220]
Got me a ticket for an aeroplane.

[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:07.200]
All right.

[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.820]
I'm on the Wheel of Fortune game.

[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.880]
I just love that sound.

[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.420]
I'm in the bonus round.

[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:14.260]
Hey, banner.

[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.600]
Pick me a letter.

[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:16.800]
Loser turn.

[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:17.680]
Hey, Pat.

[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:18.240]
Los this.

[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:18.580]
Banner.

[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:19.880]
Pick me a letter.

[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.640]
No one does it any better.

[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.160]
I dream about you.

[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.280]
All right, that is an all over town.

[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:25.740]
Banner.

[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.900]
I don't mean to stare.

[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.260]
But are you wearing underwear?

[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.740]
Not for me to say.

[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:31.180]
Anyway.

[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.300]
I don't care how much money I got to spend.

[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.120]
Can't stand to look at Pat's age.

[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.020]
Jack again.

[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.720]
Won't throw in the towel.

[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.580]
Till I buy your bowels.

[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.180]
Oh, banner.

[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:43.560]
Pick me a letter.

[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:45.480]
Please, banner.

[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:46.900]
Pick me a letter.

[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:48.600]
All right.

[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:49.580]
I'm ready to pick, baby.

[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:53.380]
ABCD, FG, HGJ, GAL, MOP, GW, WXYZ.

[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:54.760]
That's your cover, man.

[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:59.140]
All right, I'll take the sofa, the blender, the microwave, the refrigerator.

[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.000]
Hey, man, Pat, what do you mean?

[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.860]
500 dollars for a black and white five in portable TV set.

[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.300]
You got ripped off, man.

[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.560]
My brother will not forget it for your whole sale.

[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:10.080]
Give me the money and I'll buy the TV set, man.

[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:10.440]
All right?

[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:11.840]
Hey, banner, come on, baby.

[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.080]
That'll be a zit.

[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:28.000]
Peter Bulger was a normal man with a new bride, a lovely home, and a cushy, low-profile job.

[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:31.920]
Normal that is until just three weeks ago.

[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.160]
Peter, is that you?

[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.440]
Of course.

[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.160]
How is the traffic?

[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:39.400]
Fine.

[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:44.500]
Peter Bulger is suffering from glen-hield disease.

[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.220]
Our conscience has been revoked, Peter.

[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:49.720]
Are you okay, Peter?

[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:50.940]
Fine.

[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.660]
Everything's fine.

[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.460]
Just great.

[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:03.700]
Glen-hield disease is a nervous disorder, similar to Neil Rogers' disease, but even more debilitating.

[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.220]
Pity-weedy.

[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:06.960]
It's Friday night.

[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.380]
You know what that means.

[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.460]
Call me Mr. Curious.

[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.360]
Oh, God, are you a man or a bird?

[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.460]
Don't let this pathetic creature become a bird brain.

[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.880]
Send your contribution today and help us find a cure.

[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:21.980]
Oh, don't do that.

[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.320]
Why not?

[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.760]
We need the eggs.

[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.080]
WFU and the fine spot.

[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:39.020]
We're like to ask you.

[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.820]
You remember.

[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:42.160]
What?

[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:46.500]
Well, we'll let the people...

[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:47.820]
Come on, let's...

[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:50.960]
You know, if you don't like it, we can bail out, but I think it's okay.

[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:51.580]
And here it is.

[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:57.820]
Ladies and gentlemen, the unemployed mamas and poppers of the United Auto Workers.

[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:00.500]
Hyundai Hyundai.

[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.760]
And you goes to...

[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.180]
These low-priced imports.

[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:09.960]
Look real good.

[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.460]
They're just...

[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.680]
Rocking horse people.

[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:15.140]
Marshmallow pies.

[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.900]
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers.

[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.800]
They grow so incredibly high.

[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.600]
Have you ever had a marshmallow pie?

[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.580]
Sure, last night.

[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.300]
Before I go to sleep.

[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:28.900]
And you go!

[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.120]
Why, the beetles are spinning under a whole's voice.

[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.480]
You know, I like what you said about that.

[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:39.520]
It is the definitive version of Lucy and the Sky.

[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.020]
You didn't ever really think of Lucy and the Sky.

[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.600]
I can't hold this version.

[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.960]
21 before, uh, well...

[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:51.260]
This Saturday night, it's Michael Jackson around the world.

[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.780]
This is Michael.

[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:54.280]
Johnny Farr.

[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.740]
Go take a hike.

[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.800]
Before I buy.

[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.860]
A foreign car.

[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.760]
I think I'll ride a bike.

[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:09.760]
I bought a night gun.

[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.680]
And a sonic.

[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.680]
And a Sony too.

[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.680]
Put my name's cars.

[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.720]
Just gotta be.

[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.000]
Red, white and blue.

[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:26.320]
What a day, how day.

[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:32.660]
Don't trust that car.

[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.740]
You won't be anywhere.

[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.040]
You won't go far.

[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.500]
What a cool incident.

[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:45.980]
And what do I always say?

[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.520]
There are no cool instances.

[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:53.160]
Well, a Hollywood woman arrested on charges of growing marriage on a plant in her backyard

[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:58.640]
was acquitted after explaining to a judge that she used the pot as a treatment for severe glaucoma.

[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.240]
See, this was an excuse we used to use in millions of times.

[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.400]
I can't see, officer.

[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:11.020]
El the Musica testified that smoking marijuana saved her from blindness by reducing the pressure glaucoma puts on her eyes.

[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.820]
She says the thought of going blind was more frightening than going to jail.

[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.180]
Doctors also testified that Musica had more than a dozen eye operations

[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.980]
and marijuana has proven to be a successful treatment.

[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:26.220]
Broward Circuit Court Judge Mark Polin agreed with the arguments in the non jury trial.

[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:33.480]
Lawyer said it is one of only three successful cases in which medical need has been used as a defense for smoking marijuana.

[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:39.500]
So congratulations to Elvy, who's feeling a lot better, I'm sure.

[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.820]
Well, some of the birthdays we mentioned, Fest Parker 63.

[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.660]
I'm a paper isn't out yet.

[00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:48.320]
Well, you know, you're breaking the rules.

[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:54.860]
You know, Neil would have my butt if I allowed you to go on a second time.

[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:57.140]
I'm sorry.

[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:01.240]
That's okay. Just don't do it again.

[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:06.080]
Is this me you're going to hang up? I was having fun listening to you guys on the phone.

[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.560]
Did you call, collect?

[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:11.100]
No.

[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.780]
Oh, well, I'll put you on hold if you want.

[00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.200]
Well, that's how.

[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.160]
Oh, okay.

[00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:26.080]
I have replacement normal where we just reach and instantly we have it.

[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.360]
You know, we have to do this major, major search.

[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:30.680]
I don't even think those are alphabetical.

[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:34.080]
They're not alphabetical. It's very, very difficult.

[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.220]
No problem.

[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.440]
But we'll see. I'll say it would be great to hear.

[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.060]
We haven't heard this.

[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:38.520]
No, Heather's.

[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:41.920]
This is Heather's boyfriend.

[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:43.500]
Wow.

[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:48.040]
Well, Johnny is not as used as searching for these things as we are.

[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.460]
But for me to, you know, get it.

[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.580]
We got it.

[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.240]
We got it.

[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.360]
All right. We'll play it right now.

[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:54.160]
Okay?

[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.740]
No, don't do it. You say that I'm not good at this.

[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.780]
Well, you're getting better.

[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:04.060]
Now, soon as I come to finish this season, Heather will be here.

[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.740]
He's the first kid on the block.

[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.340]
And he wakes up right in the eye.

[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:11.680]
And he knows he's a little nutty.

[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:14.220]
And he knows he's a little squirly.

[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:20.120]
Well, he thinks that you and the whole inner record just to say hello.

[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:23.060]
Hi, I could see what you're all doing out there.

[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:25.940]
And I'm only not as eight or four as a meal.

[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:28.060]
But just show, come on, a meal.

[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:29.680]
Isn't that wonderful?

[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.020]
All right.

[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:31.580]
Hollywood.

[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.540]
How'd you do it?

[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.400]
Good. How are you doing?

[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.640]
I'm doing just fine.

[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.180]
Yes, you're on the air.

[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.100]
I was accepting your congratulations.

[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:42.560]
About what?

[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:43.740]
About being able.

[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.980]
I am the first woman in the United States of America who legally can smoke marijuana.

[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.360]
Oh, is this Elvy?

[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:51.640]
Yes, Dave Caprita.

[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:52.620]
All right.

[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.640]
You remember me from jazz concerts?

[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.960]
Oh, from jazz concerts.

[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:59.700]
Yeah, I understand. I'm a vocalist too.

[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:00.660]
Oh, great.

[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:01.440]
Yeah.

[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:04.940]
Yeah, you were the one that was always giving me marijuana for my eyes.

[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:13.920]
Now, is this the only show where we do a news story and then the person we were talking about calls up?

[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.580]
Yeah, you are the first ones I have called.

[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:17.480]
That's incredible.

[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.880]
But I did appreciate your congratulations and your coverage.

[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:22.460]
And I'm so excited.

[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.860]
I think I took off for the moon.

[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:30.080]
Yeah, but just, you know, with those plants and everything, just be careful that no weirdo's tried to rip you off for some.

[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:32.800]
Yeah, they did between the dogs, the cats, the neighbors.

[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.560]
I didn't get a chance.

[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.960]
I had to go to get it legally.

[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:36.720]
Wow.

[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:37.360]
Wow.

[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:38.460]
Well, good for you.

[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:41.880]
I think that's great that the judge saw your side, your viewpoint.

[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.140]
Well, he sure did.

[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:44.060]
They were wonderful.

[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.900]
The judge, even the prosecution, they had a job to do.

[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.480]
And I thought that they, you know, they were understanding.

[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.200]
They were understanding.

[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.000]
How to do it?

[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.200]
We have to do it with a job.

[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.420]
I could never take it personally.

[00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:54.700]
Yeah. Well, that's great.

[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:55.120]
Great.

[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:57.560]
That's what a coincidence that you were listening to.

[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:57.760]

[00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.640]
I listened to you guys quite often.

[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:00.180]
Yeah.

[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:01.320]
Super. That's great.

[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.080]
Well, we'll tell Neil when he gets back.

[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:03.380]
Yeah.

[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:04.720]
Yeah. That's great.

[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.180]
Okay, guys.

[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:05.880]
Bye-bye.

[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:07.800]
Thanks for calling in.

[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:08.880]
Isn't that unbelievable?

[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:11.660]
It's got to be the only show anywhere that does that.

[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:14.500]
Is this the coolest morning show in the city or what?

[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.740]
I bet you the guy who has that Elvis record that's worth half a million dollars.

[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:18.460]
Maybe he's...

[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:22.980]
Oh, when I think he looks nice.

[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.240]
When I beat my head this way.

[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.800]
And put in lots of hairspray.

[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.580]
And then a half a can of moose.

[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.960]
Mmm, got my inspiration twice.

[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.080]
Squeeze it to some needed type tunes.

[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.540]
To feel those screaming minus scenes.

[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.080]
Oh, but they seem me move.

[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.880]
Oh, but I need some talent.

[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.320]
Cause I ain't got none.

[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:49.600]
Don't forget that I was half a wham.

[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:55.780]
Oh, but I got two first things that got me started.

[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.200]
And I need a shower, baby.

[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.720]
And I need a bed, put up, raise it in my hand.

[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:01.900]
Cause I got to get shaved.

[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.500]
I got to get shaved.

[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.700]
I got to get shaved, shaved, shaved, shaved.

[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.940]
I got to get shaved, shaved, shaved.

[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:16.420]
This Saturday night, it's Michael Jackson around the world.

[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:17.040]
We bad.

[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:17.960]
This is Michael.

[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.000]
Join me for highlights in my world tour.

[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:26.200]
Then meet my special fans from exciting places like Japan.

[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.900]
And then face procreate.

[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.720]
Rockless like sister Toyota.

[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.340]
Mmm, sweetie.

[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.600]
Give me the dingy dingy.

[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:35.460]
He's a beauty, beauty girl.

[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:37.480]
Italy.

[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.720]
Oh, my dawn, bravo Megare.

[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.600]
Grab the catch your knee, huh?

[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:42.660]
That's nice.

[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:44.020]
This one you're...

[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:46.860]
Men young men should only rush his hair and need something.

[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:47.820]
And couldn't hide.

[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.080]
And even Scotland felt it was helping dance.

[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.140]
But he looks like a wee fairy to me.

[00:50:54.080 --> 00:51:00.420]
Share the magic as people around the globe discover what everyone in America already know.

[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.140]
Make it that fruit of the stage.

[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.640]
Michael Jackson around the world.

[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:06.740]
Saturday night.

[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.020]
You never...

[00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:11.200]
You never...

[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:11.980]
Is this Captain Dark?

[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.300]
I like that.

[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:17.180]
What's up today?

[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:17.940]
It's the bird.

[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:18.660]
Oh, what's up?

[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:20.140]
Yeah, this is the bird.

[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:21.060]
Yeah, this is the bird.

[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:25.700]
Listen, I've been recording most of the time this week since you guys have played bit intensive.

[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.060]
Well, yeah.

[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:30.540]
We're not as bit intensive as we were a couple months ago, right?

[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:31.980]
Well, but I'm not complaining, you know.

[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:32.640]
I understand.

[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:34.420]
But I know you're playing a guest here.

[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.500]
I think later on this week you can play soccer, soccer, again.

[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.840]
Oh, yeah, and that's great.

[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:38.780]
Did you call them mobile?

[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.220]
Did we play it yesterday?

[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:40.920]
Yeah.

[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:41.340]
Yeah.

[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.140]
And it is...

[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.660]
I think it's one of the all-time great ones, don't you?

[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:46.280]
Oh, yeah.

[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:47.040]
I...

[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.080]
You know, okay.

[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.140]
So we'll definitely...

[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:49.620]
Maybe tomorrow.

[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:50.660]
For sure.

[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:51.020]
All right.

[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:51.860]
Bye-bye.

[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:53.700]
I feel like I'm...

[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:55.620]
I'm vibrating.

[00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.160]
Everyone's favorite.

[00:51:58.260 --> 00:51:59.040]
Everyone loves it.

[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:07.020]
If you've gone ape for love over the guerrilla of your dreams, you'll want the strongest

[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.180]
protection available.

[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.660]
King Kongdom.

[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:17.400]
King Kongdoms made from the world's tallest rubber tree plants.

[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.500]
And available in a rainbow of tropical colors.

[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:25.880]
Battle tested in the German-vested jungles of Africa, South Asia and Nicaragua.

[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:30.720]
And now available in your own personal combat zone.

[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:31.100]
Ooh!

[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:35.600]
From the sewers of 42nd Street to the dippy top of the Empire State Building.

[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:39.700]
You'll never be hanging out without...

[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:44.420]
King Kongdoms.

[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:52.680]
From just outside Washington, D.C.

[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.900]
The only city in America will love and congressman of a sale 24 hours a day.

[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:02.260]
It's Camp David Letterman.

[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:06.880]
Well, late night presidential retreat with a space between its teeth.

[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:10.400]
Featuring Georgie Schultz with a late night all contraband.

[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.660]
Larry Bork-Millman and his train beard.

[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:20.680]
We'll take a ride down the Lane Duck roller coaster with a bomb zone for real town.

[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:26.760]
Then we'll drop by President Bush and the watermelon from the top of the Capitol Building

[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.420]
to see which one leaves a bigger stain.

[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:35.640]
Plus top 10 beetles, pressure group male and stupid President Frick.

[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:37.400]
My, oh my, oh my.

[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.120]
I'm having more fun than the law alone.

[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.220]
Just like Ali Nour.

[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:48.520]
It's the popular political retreat when your political popularity is retreating.

[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:53.040]
It's Camp David Letterman.

[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.320]
Yes, a blast in the past.

[00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:57.260]
That's right.

[00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:00.900]
Okay, that's the L is Camp David Letterman today.

[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:02.060]
Plot enough for you, Joe.

[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:03.020]
Oh, we got one.

[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:06.380]
That answers my question.

[00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:07.720]
Now do we have auto Dave?

[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:09.340]
Once again, you're right, Neil.

[00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.220]
Yeah, while he's out, we have auto Dave.

[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:11.900]
A little confused.

[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:12.740]
The news on vacation.

[00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:13.600]
Oh my god.

[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.580]
I just wanted to request here.

[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.180]
I want to hear this one.

[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:17.820]
Somebody called up and wanted to hear it earlier.

[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:19.460]
Oh great.

[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:20.940]
Oh, actually.

[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.560]
Can't have tonight on the Neil Rogers, you know.

[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:26.300]
Neil waits for you in the morning.

[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.840]
He always be open to smile.

[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.560]
Something not a crusade.

[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.980]
It's awesome now that you're right.

[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.260]
You're saying you won't die.

[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:34.540]
You're saying you won't die.

[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.920]
That was perfect.

[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.200]
I never heard my laugh in just one channel before.

[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:56.640]
Sold Vester Stallone stars in his most challenging role since Rein Stong.

[00:55:56.900 --> 00:56:01.120]
Your man day and you came and you came without taking.

[00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:03.100]
And now you're throwing it down.

[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:06.960]
Stallone is Manalo in Barry.

[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:08.780]
First went part one.

[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.200]
It's a miracle.

[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:14.180]
Get out your coat.

[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:15.420]
Absolutely.

[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:19.060]
Yo, Copacabana with my own.

[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:24.380]
Rex Reed says I love the costumes.

[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:26.740]
Jean Siskel exclaims four stars.

[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:28.060]
Yo, absolutely.

[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:31.260]
Roger Ebert says pass the popcorn.

[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.240]
So Vester Stallone has the limp arm of the lawn.

[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:37.660]
Barry first went part one.

[00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:38.860]
You are the disease.

[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.240]
It I'm the cure.

[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:47.100]
Just that's your coming this summer.

[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:48.600]
I know you are but what a boy.

[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:50.080]
Rudger Hauer in.

[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:51.520]
I know you are but what a boy.

[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.720]
Peewees last adventure.

[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.260]
I know you are but what a-

[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:02.380]
I'm 50.

[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:10.960]
Alan Box was a normal man with a wife, children, a summer home in Opalaka,

[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:12.720]
and a chain of radio stations.

[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:15.820]
Well, normal that is until just three weeks ago.

[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:17.980]
Hi, honey. How was your day?

[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:19.620]
Unbelievable.

[00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:21.460]
Terminal.

[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.620]
There's nothing but subhuman douchebags out there.

[00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:28.260]
Alan Box is suffering from Neal Rogers disease.

[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:30.480]
Have you canceled the Miami Herald yet?

[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:32.700]
But honey, we don't subscribe to the Herald.

[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:34.400]
Oh, now that's a cop out.

[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:36.040]
What kind of a lame excuse is that?

[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.060]
Just say no to Elle Heralds, sir.

[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:44.420]
People afflicted with Neal Rogers disease have lost the ability to communicate like normal human beings.

[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:45.840]
What's the matter with you?

[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:48.120]
Blue hair don't bags from Pembroke Pines.

[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:53.160]
You know the Yenthan's who say, oh, Neal, how can you say those nasty things?

[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:55.080]
Running around stealing sweet and low.

[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.200]
Can I get you anything?

[00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:58.320]
How about those bad boys at Windixi?

[00:57:58.680 --> 00:57:59.560]
You know, it doesn't hurt to look.

[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:01.200]
Incredible.

[00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:04.680]
Neal Rogers disease, a growing South Florida epidemic.

[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.460]
Please help us find a cure.

[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:08.200]
Honey, it's Friday night.

[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:09.660]
You know what that means.

[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:11.020]
Hey, you know what I got? A nine.

[00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:11.740]
A nine.

[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:13.200]
What's Leifahler got?

[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:13.940]
Three points, something?

[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:16.520]

[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:19.200]
Terminal.

[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:20.940]
Unbelievable.

Maybe you need to wake your picture

[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:28.120]

[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:32.020]
Maybe you need to wake our

[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:32.900]

[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:51.320]
Yeah, he is the one who wakes you up.

[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:55.280]
Yeah, I'm the one who wakes you up.

[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:58.160]
Yeah, I'm the one who wakes you up.

[01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:58.300]
Great.

[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:00.820]
Okay, nice to hear that again.

[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:01.440]
Why?

[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:02.000]
Okay.

[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:03.840]
Oh, yeah.

[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:04.380]
Yeah.

[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.040]
Here it is.

[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:08.580]
Hey, Charlie Browns!

[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.680]
Wanna kick my football?

[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.820]
The whole B-nudge gang is back!

[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.660]
Gosh, I can't today, Lucy.

[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:18.980]
I got a TV voiceover for a Metropolitan Life commercial.

[01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:19.880]
Big deal.

[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:23.860]
I just inked a 10-year contract with those goofballs at Hallmark cards.

[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:25.120]
I'm set for life.

[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.860]
Hey, here comes Linus.

[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.740]
I wonder if he still got the Dolly Madison account.

[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.880]
Hi, guys! Guess what I found out?

[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:32.600]
What?

[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:36.600]
We're not gonna make any of these stupid endorsements.

[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:38.120]
But why Linus?

[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.680]
Because we're just cartoon characters you jerk,

[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:44.660]
besides, my agent says Mr. Schultz gets everything.

[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:45.780]
Oh, no!

[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.100]
You saw the sound, Charlie Schultz!

[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:53.040]
Yes, the whole B-nudge gang is back, and they're bitter.

[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:56.380]
We do all the work, and that old geek gets all the money.

[01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.460]
I know, let's just stop being funny.

[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:02.320]
I think we stopped doing that a long time ago.

[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:06.900]
Yes, it's the real story of the man who stopped working for B-nudge.

[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:09.180]
You sold out, Charlie Schultz!

[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.420]
This fall on CBS!

[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:11.880]
Ha-ha-ha!

[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:18.040]
We don't need no monkey nonsense!

[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:27.240]
We already tried to tell we will show.

[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:55.940]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

No, it's not.

[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:47.660]
Go ahead.

[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:48.300]
Hello.

[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:49.300]
Who's there?

[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:51.520]
Don't.

[01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:52.240]
What?

[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:53.860]
Don't.

[01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:54.560]
Don't.

[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:56.540]
Don't.

[01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:56.680]
Don't who?

[01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.760]
Don't buy a house.

[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:01.240]
Ha, ha, boy.

[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:02.880]
That was great to hear that again, wasn't it?

[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.720]
I was going to ask a political question.

[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:05.900]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:06.920]
I wonder why.

[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:08.480]
I ignore you.

[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:08.740]
I think so.

[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:10.780]
Would you like to read headlines like Dan Rather?

[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:16.140]
Grass, rural events like Walter Cronkite, explain the news to the public like Peter Jennings?

[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:17.180]
No?

[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:20.000]
Then there's a trading center just for you.

[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:22.060]
The Bird School of Newscasters.

[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:27.900]

[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:28.460]
way.

[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:33.440]
People will be talking about your newscasts all day after you grasp just a few pronunciation

[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.260]
techniques.

[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.160]
You'll be saying things like...

[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:41.380]
Carol says pull out plans were ordered after new evacuations of the peace agreement suggested

[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:44.720]
it may rather new evaluations of the peace agreement.

[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:46.400]
What was the evacuation or evaluation?

[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:46.940]
I'm sorry.

[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:49.160]
Evacuation of the peace agreement?

[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:54.600]
And it will teach the highlights from a thousand secret tape recording.

[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:58.460]
You'll learn to pronounce different government programs such as...

[01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.500]
Not to chop social security benefits.

[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:03.360]
And keep the public aware of top world events.

[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:08.120]
And the CIA would have to assess the countries or assist the countries.

[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:13.120]
And the Bird School of Newscasters will assess you in pronouncing foreign terms.

[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:14.080]
Nouveau?

[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:15.220]
Nouveau?

[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:15.780]

[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:16.320]
Nouveau?

[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:17.040]
Nouveau?

[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:21.000]

1920s movie star and Kansas graduate Charles Buddy Rogers.

Kansas?

[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.220]
And other geographical areas such as Iran?

[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.120]
Kuwaiti.

[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:36.740]

It's just crack.

[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:09.380]
That's up to here then.

[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.140]
Boy, that brings back a flood of memories, don't they, Captain?

[01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:15.600]
All those were from the early days when we were from then.

[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:16.820]
First thing started over here.

[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:19.760]
I produced it on this side, but it was before you guys came over here.

[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:20.780]
No, it couldn't have been.

[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:21.200]
It was.

[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:24.860]
Because I had you go into the eight track room and did the prices thing.

[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.560]
Because it made the original head disappear.

[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:32.160]
It's so far from the M.I.Sora.

[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:42.220]
Station stuff.

[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:44.020]
I've got lips.

[01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:46.260]
Ah, that was a mom.

[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.300]
Oh, let's hear that one again.

[01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:48.880]
That's it.

[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.160]
No one ever hears that again.

[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:51.480]
So let's hear this again.

[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:52.520]
Adios.

[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:54.980]
Ah, boy, people love that.

[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.340]
And we should play that more often, don't they?

[01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:59.120]
I think it says it all and just one or two words.

[01:21:59.120 --> 01:21:59.920]
It really does.

[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:01.260]
It really does.

[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:02.700]
The lottery day, oh, good morning.

[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:03.800]
All right, glad to know how you're doing.

[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:04.800]
OK, how are you?

[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:06.220]
I got a little something you should hear.

[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.400]
OK, here it comes.

[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.500]
Speaking of that, we better take this call out here.

[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:10.720]
Hello.

[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.280]
Yes, struggling.

[01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:13.440]
Yes, struggling.

[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:14.340]
Yes, struggling.

[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:15.660]
How about you, honey?

[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:16.520]
Are you struggling?

[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:17.300]
Sure.

[01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.620]
It sounds like it's struggling to say a lie.

[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.020]
I'm not making it.

[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.480]
How come we're number one, honey?

[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:25.520]
Number one is picking up your number one.

[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:26.320]
Whoa.

[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:27.200]
Whoa.

[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:28.420]
I love wee-

[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:29.220]
Allered, oh god.

[01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:30.500]
One that great, thank you.

[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:30.740]
That was great.

[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.500]
Yeah, so you know, wait a second.

[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.640]
You know, I was going to make a promo out of that.

[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:39.800]
And we only got like the tail end of the call, so to speak.

[01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:41.040]
So you want to play it back?

[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:41.920]
No, no.

[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:44.020]
I was going to say if you can make a copy of it,

[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.680]
here we're asking for a copy for you.

[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:47.200]
Yeah, that's the kind of thing.

[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:47.500]
Can I send it in?

[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:48.600]
Yeah, we'd love it.

[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:48.940]
Yeah.

[01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:50.300]
We're bringing it by, you know?

[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:51.720]
We'd love it because it's something

[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.260]
we could play during the show also.

[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:58.060]
I got some tapes of when Neil was on stand show.

[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.460]
And DJ was there and EJ.

[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.520]
Oh, god.

[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:04.040]
I got some stuff that I'll put a few extra things on there.

[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:04.820]
OK, great.

[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:05.560]
We'll love it.

[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:06.920]
And hey, you guys are doing a great show.

[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:07.560]
Thanks, Amelia.

[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:08.080]
Thanks.

[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.160]
Oh, wouldn't that be great to have that?

[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.800]
Do you know, just like to play on our show?

[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:13.660]
You're struggling.

[01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:15.080]
And by the way, if you missed it,

[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:16.520]
she called us this week.

[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:17.220]
Hi, Brad.

[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:18.080]

[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:19.340]
Hi, Joe.

[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:20.680]
Hi, Joe.

[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:21.020]

[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:21.420]
Hi, Brad.

[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:22.180]
Hi.

[01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:24.940]
Hi.

[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:26.040]
Hi.

[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:26.600]
How are you?

[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.780]
This is Captain Dan.

[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:30.460]
And Captain Dan.

[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:31.120]
Captain Dan.

[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:31.200]

[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:31.280]

[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:34.360]
What is that?

[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:35.600]
What?

[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:37.820]
It's a male girl.

[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.360]
Oh, Neil went to Hawaii.

[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:40.340]
Don't say anything.

[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:40.940]
We have to dump.

[01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:44.160]
We never had to dump a three-year-old.

[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:45.300]
The Neil's gone.

[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.440]
You know, we have your butt head song.

[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:48.300]
Can you believe it?

[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:49.120]
It's not been paid.

[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.080]
I'm going to have it running.

[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:51.000]
It's going to tape right now.

[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:51.000]

[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:51.000]

[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:51.000]

[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:51.000]

[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:51.000]

[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.480]
You guys have a good day and you're doing a great job.

[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:54.080]
Thanks.

[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:54.440]
Hi.

[01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:56.020]
You guys have a good day.

[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:58.000]
Let's say 744 will give her...

[01:23:58.660 --> 01:23:59.840]
Why don't we play a jingle?

[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:01.340]
Give her time to get her tape set up.

[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:02.160]
And then we'll play it.

[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:03.220]
How about he talks about...

[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:03.560]
Now let's see.

[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:04.520]
I'm even requesting it.

[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:04.920]
Here it is.

[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.600]
He talks about...

[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:07.920]
You ask and you got it.

[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:09.100]
And you can go right into that.

[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:10.240]
The things you want to know.

[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:14.080]
He talks about all the things you want to know.

[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:16.280]
He approaches on the radio.

[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:20.240]
He brings you all sorts of topics

[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.340]
to listen to when you show.

[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:26.160]
Monday through Friday.

[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.380]
Before six to laugh to ten.

[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.120]
And he's talking to you.

[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:32.820]
Right here.

[01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:34.240]
I'll say that for...

[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:38.320]
Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers in the audience.

[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:45.140]
Neorragis, Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers in the audience.

Porsche cars just about running me clean off the road.

[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:26.540]
Well, I decided it wasn't going to do me no good to get mad at him,

[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:29.120]
so I just kind of sit down and wrote this song about him instead.

[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:30.120]
And it goes like this.

[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:37.700]
Where you born a butt head, or did you work at it your whole life?

[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:45.240]
Either way, worked out fine, because you're a butt head tonight.

[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:53.100]
You're a BUTT HAD, and don't you try to blame it on me.

[01:25:54.380 --> 01:26:00.600]
You deserve all the credit, because you're a butt head tonight.

[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:08.360]
You were a butt head yesterday, and you're a butt head tonight.

[01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:16.120]
I've got a feeling you'll be a butt head, the rest of your life.

[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:16.780]
Let's sing it.

[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:17.200]
Here we go.

[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:24.140]
Where you born a butt head, or did you work at it your whole life?

[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:31.660]
Either way, worked out fine, because you're a butt head tonight.

[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:58.920]
I was talking to your mother just the other night, and I told her that I thought that you were a butt head.

[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:02.560]
She said, yes, I think you're right.

[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:10.460]
And all your friends, your butt heads, because you've known them your whole life.

[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:18.080]
And somebody told me, you got a butt head for a wife.

[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:18.840]
Here we go.

[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:25.840]
Where you born a butt head, or did you work at it your whole life?

[01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:33.260]
Either way, worked out fine, because you're a butt head tonight.

[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:41.280]
Everybody join in, where you born a butt head, or did you work at it your whole life?

[01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:48.880]
Either way, worked out fine, because you're a butt head tonight.

[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:50.240]
Let's do that last line.

[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:58.820]
Either way, it worked out fine, because you're a butt head tonight.

[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:08.900]
Wow, better while since I heard that, but hit song for you this morning on the Neil Rogers Show and Zeta Ford.

[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:13.380]
Hey, honey.

[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:16.800]
Honey, you okay?

[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:24.400]
This poor man is suffering from painful vowel movements.

[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:33.840]
He needs the letter turning relief of Neil Vanoite, the soothing new liquid with a second banana flavor.

[01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:40.520]
So don't be sentenced to the consonant pain of crammed vowels.

[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:43.240]
Reach for the bottle in the gold lamegown.

[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:47.080]
Vanoite, it'll keep you letter perfect.

[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:49.600]
Neil from SayJack, laboratories.

[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.020]
We miss that before, didn't we?

[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:52.340]
Do we?

[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:55.200]
Mmm, it good.

[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:57.780]
The news, beaches are closed again today.

[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:01.480]
More medical waste and other pollutants continue to wash ashore.

[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.700]
Medical officials have no idea when.

[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:07.920]
Surrounding these loves are tested, they're all messy.

[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:11.480]
They're back, and now they stink more than ever.

[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:14.440]
It's the closed beach boys.

[01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:28.680]
Yummy! You could out of that water this instant.

[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:33.180]
Shut them down, shut them down, got to shut the beaches down.

[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:35.880]
Yes, all their hits are here.

[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:40.500]
Plus you'll get hook John B, smell me Ronda, little douce cooleys,

[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:41.640]
and who could forget?

[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:46.140]
Goo Goo Goo Goo, vibration, scream,

[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:53.400]
Cache, goo Goo Goo Goo, vibration, the closed beach boys.

[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:54.780]
Now it chores everywhere.

[01:29:56.380 --> 01:30:00.060]
Okay, a rare call from Marga, what's wrong?

[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:00.880]
Hey, what's up?

[01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:03.260]
What's wrong? Wait, you said like six cookies in a...

[01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:04.220]
Hold on just a second, sir.

[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:06.140]
Now what's the problem?

[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:09.280]
I just had six cookies in a span of 90 seconds.

[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.580]
Captain Dave ate six cookies in 90 seconds.

[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:12.440]
Can you believe that?

[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:12.880]
Is that a rare...

[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:14.280]
And they're big cookies, too.

[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:16.120]
These are like big chocolate chunk cookies.

[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:18.140]
They had to bring them in like in pizza boxes.

[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.860]
How you doing this morning?

[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:23.140]
Good. All right, here's something for you.

[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:24.140]
I was reading Omni Magazine.

[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:24.740]
Uh-huh.

[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:26.960]
All right, now listen to this.

[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.120]
Okay, stand up women.

[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:29.860]
Oh, I read that.

[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:31.160]
Is this weird?

[01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:32.220]
I read that.

[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.300]
I don't even know if we can talk about that.

[01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:35.920]
Oh, oh, yeah, you can't.

[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:38.860]
Well, okay, you try it. I'll keep my hand on the dump button.

[01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:40.260]
All right, and we'll see if you go too far.

[01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:45.320]
Women are finally taking a stand in addressing the problem of hygiene and puff.

[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:46.240]
Oh, I've heard of this.

[01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:47.380]
Can we talk about this?

[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:48.780]
Reff funnel.

[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:50.200]
Yeah, it's in the magazine.

[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.360]
All right, it's a funnel. I know it is.

[01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:53.240]
It's called leaf funnel.

[01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:54.300]
Leaf funnel.

[01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:54.860]
Leaf funnel.

[01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:55.940]
Yeah, leaf funnel.

[01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:57.880]
Allow the women to your name while standing up.

[01:30:58.300 --> 01:30:58.960]
Yeah, I know.

[01:30:59.260 --> 01:30:59.800]
Well, why?

[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.560]
Well, it's the 80s, you know?

[01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:04.800]
That's for, um, uh...

[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:05.900]
High...

[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:11.120]
I think it's that old, like, equal rights.

[01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:12.360]
Yeah, man.

[01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:14.820]
They, you know, they've always been, you know,

[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:17.600]
envious of that, that we, you know, that they...

[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:18.800]
Well, let me just...

[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:19.800]
I can't get into this.

[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.840]
I wish we were off there, we could have a real interesting discussion.

[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:26.420]
Yeah, but you guys are talking about...

[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:27.400]
I was talking about being on cars yesterday.

[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:28.100]
What?

[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:31.020]
We're talking about, you know, urinating on cars yesterday.

[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:32.260]
Urinating on cars.

[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:32.980]
I was talking...

[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:34.680]
Johnny say he urinated out his car, so...

[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:35.340]
Oh, yeah, it was...

[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:35.880]
Oh, that's true.

[01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:36.360]
Yeah.

[01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:39.880]
We were talking about the beneficiary, um...

[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:40.940]
Um...

[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:42.080]
Health...

[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:42.680]
Oh, yeah.

[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.400]
Well, we were talking about people...

[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.060]
The benefits of...

[01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:46.160]
The benefits of...

[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:47.120]
You're absolutely correct, sir.

[01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:48.060]
About the group...

[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:49.720]
There's a group of people who, uh...

[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.160]
Yeah, I saw that on montage,

[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.760]
or people who, uh, drink the...

[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:53.560]
You're on yours.

[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:54.480]
Yeah, that's correct.

[01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:56.200]
Yeah, you're right.

[01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:58.080]
We're stretching it to go with that.

[01:31:58.160 --> 01:31:59.400]
But I saw that on montage,

[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:00.940]
so I thought we could talk about that,

[01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:02.180]
and it's no, like, secret or anything.

[01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:03.000]
And was it montage?

[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:04.500]
Yes, I saw it on montage.

[01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:05.400]
It was like 60 minutes, sir.

[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:06.920]
No, it was montage a few weeks ago.

[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:08.280]
I remember it vividly.

[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:08.540]
Yeah.

[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:11.240]
So you're right, it is kind of the same thing, isn't it?

[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:12.280]
Yeah, well, you know.

[01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:16.100]
It's selling in the drugstore, now, I haven't seen it yet, but...

[01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:16.360]
Wow.

[01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:18.180]
$4.99 for a box of ten.

[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:21.460]
50 cents a pop.

[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.000]
A pop.

[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:24.980]
A shoot, 50 cents a shoot.

[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:25.380]
Yeah.

[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:25.880]
Yeah.

[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:26.680]
I'll lift the can.

[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:27.120]
I'm going up the corner.

[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:27.800]
Yeah.

[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:29.460]
Like in a couple of weeks, I'm going up north.

[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:30.960]
Believe it to beaver.

[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:33.520]
Starring Barbara Billingsley.

[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:35.300]
Hugh Beaumont.

[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:37.020]
Tony Dahl.

[01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:40.580]
And Clint Eastwood as the beaver.

[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:44.840]
Oh, you wanted to see me, Dad.

[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:46.740]
Yes, beaver? Sit down.

[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:48.000]
I am, Dad.

[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:50.620]
Keep in mind I'm six foot four.

[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:56.000]
So, uh, what's the problem, Dad?

[01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:58.640]
Beaver, I have never been more disappointed in you

[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.880]
than I was today when you walked in the principal's office

[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:02.580]
wearing that horrible sweatshirt.

[01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:05.560]
Oh, you mean my Beastie boy's sweatshirt?

[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:06.140]
Right.

[01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:09.540]
And I just can't understand it.

[01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:12.220]
Just this morning your mother and I both told you

[01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:14.340]
to take that sweatshirt off before you went to school.

[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:16.500]
Now, why did you deliberately disobey us?

[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:19.060]
Come on, Dad. It's the biggest concert of the year.

[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:21.400]
Run DMC in the Beasties.

[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:23.440]
And I already got my tickets.

[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:25.060]
Oh, no, beaver.

[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.760]
Oh, yeah, Dad.

[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:29.120]
All right, you can go.
