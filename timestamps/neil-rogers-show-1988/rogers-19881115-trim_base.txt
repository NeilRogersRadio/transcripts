[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340]
W-I-O-D.

[00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.800]
This is being real by good rapid minutes.

[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.320]
Okay, now I wanted to give Barbara a chance to clean, get it in without any problems.

[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.860]
Okay, 1038 at W-I-O-D. Our next caller is in Fort Lauderdale. Hello?

[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.760]
Daniel.

[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.580]
Yeah.

[00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.800]
It's about time you come out of your shell and talk about your ratings.

[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.840]
For crying out loud, I've been listening to you for years and you never talk about your ratings.

[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.840]
Well, that's right for everything, sir.

[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.020]
I mean, it's about time you. You've got to get over that shine.

[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.660]
I know.

[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.760]
I know.

[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.020]
I've been listening to you for 10 years, Neil, and this was the first time you ever

[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.180]
break the box you're rating.

[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.780]
That's right.

[00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.840]
But I want to be with you more about it.

[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.840]
One of the ones you want.

[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.600]
You will produce her to that show. I've got a secret.

[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.040]

[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.840]
No matter if I just to calm you down, sir, we're going to do an entire four hours on it tomorrow.

[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.200]
Okay.

[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.540]
Boy, what a maniac, huh?

[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.820]
Yeah.

[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.280]
I'll leave if you just talk a little more to talk to me.

[00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.340]
I'll carry a big number.

[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.940]
That's a problem.

[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.960]
We never learned that lesson.

[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.960]
Speak softly and carry a big number.

[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.540]
I see.

[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.720]
All right.

[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.460]
We do have an open line in Broward where that maniac just hung up.

[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.120]
At least five, two, four, a WIOD.

[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.480]
At least senior senior, yeah.

[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.280]
Well, that's nice getting those calls from Winmore once in a while.

[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.020]
Oh, you know what?

[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.020]
Four-letter mail.

[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.260]
Hello.

[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.260]
Yeah.

[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.780]
I'd like to know what rock in Hollandale he called out from under.

[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.940]
Probably sunny Rosenberg's uncle.

[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.400]
God, I couldn't believe that guy was wild.

[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.320]
How was that?

[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.660]
I believe that.

[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.000]
All right.

[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.220]
Don't get carried away now, sir.

[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.900]
Why won't you?

[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.020]
I won't, sir.

[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.440]
This is my only day off, so it's like the only time I get to have her speak with you.

[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.520]
And I started getting calls.

[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.100]
And I'm not trying to be a chronic.

[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.920]
That's okay.

[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.160]
Don't want to be a chronic.

[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.600]
Okay.

[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.240]
But I want you to know I'm a supporter.

[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.960]
Great.

[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.420]
And I am a converted am.

[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.360]
Are you an athletic supporter, also, sir?

[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.820]
Yeah.

[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.740]
That's good.

[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.260]
Great.

[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.020]
Because we need all the doll fans we can get.

[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.500]
We had like, over 11,000 empty seats last night.

[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.820]
And obviously with good cause.

[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.580]
Yeah.

[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.560]
Well, you know, I mean, one day I'm going to go down to Robby Stadium, but I don't know if

[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.060]
it's going to be for a dolphin game.

[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.560]
So I'm going to be here.

[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.920]
Yeah.

[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.200]
Moving right along.

[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.200]
Moving right along.

[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.020]
Okay.

[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.880]
One thing is, the trends actually say anything about days or is it just as it goes by?

[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.960]
Yeah.

[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.460]
It says like Monday between 10.07 and 10.08.

[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.300]
Of course it doesn't say by day.

[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.200]
I don't know, sir.

[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.880]
I'm sorry.

[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.520]
Okay, sir.

[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.200]
Because I'd like to know, you know, how Gonzer's cross-talk does.

[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.860]
Oh, we have that.

[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.740]
No, they don't, it doesn't go that low.

[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.320]
I don't know.

[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.200]
Nothing under a point one makes it in this.

[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.640]
I'm glad.

[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.340]
Yeah.

[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.880]
If you could possibly persuade Neil to play like Jeb Boy, Jeb Girl, I'd like you to do your

[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.680]
don't want to play in part of it.

[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.320]
I just got you playing part of it a minute ago, sir.

[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.400]
I just got you playing about a minute of it a little while ago.

[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.860]
I mean, this is the only day I can tape it.

[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.080]
Or you want the whole thing?

[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.380]

[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.620]
And I'd like to do it with WRMS intro.

[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.140]
Because I love how he does that.

[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.540]
I tease that patient because they play it at my work.

[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.740]
I have to like listen to it.

[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.800]
And you guys are so right.

[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.220]
Yeah.

[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.880]
They step all over it.

[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.240]
I am.

[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.460]
So I'd like to like, you know, keep it and then take it to work.

[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.780]
You were a lot, don't you?

[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.380]
A lot.

[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.300]
If I were you, I wouldn't take it to work.

[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.660]
I would leave it home if I were you.

[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.300]
You know what I mean?

[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.720]
Well, my boss, you're on.

[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.820]
I'm trying to say this, sir.

[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.180]
What?

[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.680]
My boss is a douchebag.

[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.960]
Yeah.

[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.860]
So, you know, I mean, it's kind of funny.

[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.140]
No, you're promising us this is your only day off of the week, right?

[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.600]
So it's only two days we need to.

[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.600]

[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.200]
I want to talk to you for the last week.

[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.060]
And one of the questions.

[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.100]
Thank God.

[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.400]
Yeah.

[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.800]
And then I'll leave you a month.

[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.200]
Okay.

[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.500]
Please.

[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.980]
If Butch beer was pulled from GTR, how can they're letting you play it?

[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.840]
And, you know, the same dole thing.

[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.860]
Because I'm a hell of a lot more Butch than those guys.

[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.480]
Okay, sir.

[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.600]
Okay, is that answer your question?

[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.200]
And we'll try a later for JetBoy Jet Girl.

[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.080]
I can't promise anything.

[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.560]
It depends on how long these break fair.

[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.580]
Well, if there's anything like songwires or anything you got to play, Glenn, please.

[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.920]
CDR and that venture.

[00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.360]
Okay.

[00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.920]
Okay.

[00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.620]
Okay.

[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.100]
Bye.

[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.200]
Oh, God.

[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.840]
Now we got another whole seven days before we have to hear from him again.

[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.540]
Now, he means well.

[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.560]
He's just, he needs to put you up a little bit.

[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.300]
1042 at WIOD.

[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.640]
Miami.

[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.060]
Hello.

[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.980]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.420]
Yeah.

[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.100]
How are you?

[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.660]
Great.

[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.800]
Um, you know, I just wanted to ask you a question about that.

[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.060]
About what?

[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.920]
One station that no one has any competition, which is, uh, that, uh, a kiss up out?

[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.440]
Yeah.

[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.040]
What are they doing in the morning?

[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.260]
Well, in the morning?

[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.040]
Kiss in the morning.

[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.140]
Kiss in the morning.

[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.540]
Sounds like something we couldn't say up till a short time ago.

[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.020]
Sure does.

[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.500]
Let's see.

[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.460]
WKIS, they went from a two eight down to a two six.

[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.140]
They tied for a 15th.

[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.460]
Wow.

[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.020]
Which is, you know, not so great.

[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.920]
Not so good.

[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.560]
Not so great.

[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.360]
All right.

[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.380]
And then you add QAM, which they also, they own the same, uh, the OSEM owners own both stations.

[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.720]
Right.

[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.300]
And QAM in the morning had a, um, had a, uh, something, but I don't see it anywhere.

[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.620]
Wow.

[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.640]
Can you believe that?

[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.480]
It's not even even make it in.

[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.620]
Is that possible?

[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.500]
That's, uh, incredible.

[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.400]
I don't see it.

[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.900]
I really don't.

[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.720]
They didn't even make it.

[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.520]
So in other words, they had less than a point seven.

[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.680]
But I don't even put it in.

[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.120]
No.

[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.960]
God.

[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.600]
Yeah.

[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.500]
I only thought this, uh, you know, I'm the, uh, football games and then brought them out.

[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.920]
Yeah.

[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.080]
So I'm like, just doing my own race radius.

[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.880]
Did they lock it out?

[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.540]
I drove all the way and pulled my Irish last night.

[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.260]
Oh, what a smart move that was, boy.

[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.940]
It must have been a real fun trip back.

[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.780]
They dragged it out all the way over there too.

[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.880]
Did they really?

[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.300]
Yeah.

[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.480]
So why didn't you drive to Orlando?

[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.560]
Or Fort Pierce.

[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.200]
You know, you got a great bar up there in Fort Pierce.

[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.400]
You could have had a hell of a time.

[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.420]
The, uh, the, all drive in.

[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.740]
Boy, there's some big oversteers up there too.

[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.100]
Yeah.

[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.460]
That's right next to the Roach Motel, by the way.

[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.140]
Very big.

[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.000]
Well, then, right?

[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.440]
You have.

[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.860]
Yeah, you haven't had a great night.

[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.020]
I enjoy that performance.

[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.780]
I'm in.

[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.500]
I ended up having a, well, you know, I'm going to listen to, I put the TV on the hood.

[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.600]
And don't you know you're supposed to stay here because it was blacked out and Rick and Hank had it here on WIOD?

[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.440]
I know that.

[00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.340]
We mentioned at at least a hundred times yesterday on this stage and you're supposed to stay here and listen to it.

[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:06.240]
Yeah, well, I listened to him on the radio and for the play by play from the radio for the TV because I couldn't hear the TV.

[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.680]
Great.

[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.160]
But then, you know, then they said that we're going to be on fire.

[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.760]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.420]
Now, you said you put the TV on the hood of your car?

[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.900]
Yeah.

[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.020]

[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.920]

[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.560]
What a night this guy went.

[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.080]
And the generator kicking out.

[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.400]
And he got a room stop.

[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.680]
We run a different strobe.

[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.680]
So what did you do while you were there?

[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.760]
Just listen to it on the radio.

[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.540]
I informed my.

[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.440]
I just had driving home with me to it.

[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.720]
Excellent. But that was good.

[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.540]
It was fun.

[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.660]
You know, it was interesting.

[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.300]
Yeah, this could be probably the dumbest off-man of all time.

[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.740]
It's great. You realize that you're in a special class.

[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.080]
Yeah, I know.

[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.740]
Well, that was good.

[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.200]
I'm proud of you and I hope that you didn't take it personally, right?

[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.580]
Yeah.

[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.560]
I mean, you know, when they get beat bad, you don't have to feel bad.

[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.320]
I thought it's great.

[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.140]
That's it.

[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.300]
I had to wheel note that.

[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.840]
Yeah.

[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.060]
Okay, well listen, have a great day.

[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.440]
We'll tell Rick and Hank you said so.

[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:53.840]
All right.

[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.240]
Can you imagine weaver today boy?

[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.540]
He must be foaming it up.

[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.940]
Uh, um, must be apple plucked.

[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.540]
Mm hmm.

[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.600]
I mean, they just, they just, some of these games aren't even in them.

[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.220]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.220]
Like last night, it was just desperate.

[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.360]
Horrendous.

[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.220]
It wasn't one of those that we'd like touch and go and they made some stupid mistake in blue.

[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.260]
They just got blown out.

[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.780]
Oh.

[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.700]
But we don't want to dwell on that at all.

[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.300]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.480]
We don't even want to mention it.

[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.900]
Indeed, Kathy, there's an open line 751WIOD.

[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.660]
Anything you want.

[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.580]
You don't have to be talking about the ratings if you want to call in and bitch about Paul Harvey not being on.

[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.220]
I mean, especially welcome.

[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:36.320]
No, seriously, what I'd like to hear from and I know this is asking a lot are the WIOD listeners who didn't listen to our show before.

[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.060]
Okay.

[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.300]
And we've had a few of those.

[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:38.580]
Yeah.

[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.160]
Oh, sure.

[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.440]
During the first six days of the show.

[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.200]
And today is number seven and we are counting.

[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.500]
Yes.

[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.540]
And wait, it's incredible.

[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.340]
We keep running into people that have never heard you ever in their whole life.

[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.240]
It's astounding.

[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.520]
And thank God for that.

[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:50.960]
Wow.

[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.060]
Okay, 1045.

[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.880]
I have a little indigestion because we're not having any lunch today.

[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.320]
We want to be on our best behavior.

[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.880]
I had breakfast at Burger King.

[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.280]
Okay.

[00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:58.740]
Wow.

[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.800]
I had two bacon and cheese croissants.

[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.280]
Boy, you really know how to live.

[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.760]
And my iced tea, which I'm still sipping on the iced tea here.

[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.240]
And I think the iced tea is what's giving me this terminal heartburn.

[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.200]
So we have no food in here today.

[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:19.020]
We want to pacify everybody because Mike Disney came back yesterday and we want to at least one day give the appearance that we're trying desperately to keep the food out.

[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.460]
We're not.

[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.840]
But we want to make it look good.

[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.360]
Okay.

[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.860]
Because our lunch on this show is probably the most important part of the show.

[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.760]
And if he doesn't know that yet, that's his problem.

[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.640]
He'll learn it.

[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.080]
He'll learn it the tough way.

[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.360]
And where he made the big mistake, he said, well, let's keep that food out of there.

[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.040]
All along, I'll tell you what, I'll leave it up to Mitch.

[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:35.880]
Mm-hmm.

[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.580]
Well, let Mitch Ween have the final word.

[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.340]
He's our chief engineer.

[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.880]
And after all the nice things I've said about Mitch since we've been here.

[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:41.240]
Yeah.

[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.180]
He couldn't possibly come in here and say, keep the food out.

[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.500]
He just isn't that kind of guy.

[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.040]
Well, it's interesting to me it's bill didn't seem the least bit concerned about it all.

[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.420]
I still might come back yesterday.

[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.360]
And just like jumping through.

[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.620]
Why is it became a madman?

[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.060]
He was in your grab of the box.

[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.080]
He did.

[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.220]
He did.

[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:56.580]
He did.

[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.520]
He went nuts yesterday.

[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.180]
He did.

[00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:58.960]
Coral Gables.

[00:08:59.100 --> 00:08:59.260]
Hello.

[00:08:59.580 --> 00:08:59.700]
Yeah.

[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.520]
Mr. Rages.

[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.100]
Yes, sir.

[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:07.200]
A few years ago you played a record called Decreputating Contest on another station.

[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:07.860]
Yes.

[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:08.720]
Do you remember that?

[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.560]
Well, as a matter of fact, this may be a psychic of some kind.

[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:12.860]
Yeah.

[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.380]
Because just yesterday a friend of mine who I gave a tape of that to a virgin clean cassette.

[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.080]
You're kidding.

[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.800]
Mentioned to me that he still got it and he's going to give it to me.

[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.220]
So what we're going to do is we're going to run it by Bill Y.

[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:24.820]
So to speak.

[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.040]
Yeah.

[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.380]
Let him listen to it.

[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.420]
And if he says it's okay, we'll play it in a few days.

[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.060]
I wonder where I could buy that record.

[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.680]
Well, you can buy it from Betty's rare records in Louisville, Kentucky.

[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.480]
We know I don't have the number handy right here.

[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.220]
But when we play it.

[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:38.580]
Yeah.

[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.620]
We'll dig up the number for Betty or the address and we'll give it on the air.

[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.240]
Because what happened is when we've played it before we had a run on people.

[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.720]
Again, you pardon the expression.

[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.740]
We had a run on people who wanted a copy of it.

[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.480]
And so we got the address and she had tons of orders for it.

[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.820]
Yeah, but I believe if you call Louisville information, Betty's rare record.

[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.680]
They can give you the number.

[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:57.980]
I think that's how we got the bill.

[00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:58.900]
Louisville, Kentucky.

[00:09:59.100 --> 00:09:59.240]
Yeah.

[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.300]
And she's a great lady.

[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:01.800]
Yeah.

[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.880]
I heard that record many, many years ago.

[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.420]
As a matter of fact, I think I thought to show when I was in the Battle Creek go a thousand years ago, you know.

[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.980]
And I enjoyed it very much and I still enjoy it.

[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.420]
You mean when I was in Kalamazoo?

[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:14.800]
Yeah.

[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:15.680]
Are you serial?

[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:16.920]
I'm serial, yeah.

[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.840]
Boy, you must be my oldest listener.

[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.640]
I don't mean oldest in terms of height.

[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.460]
I understand, yeah.

[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.480]
You know, I was a station over there in that battle hospital.

[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:25.100]
Yeah.

[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.160]
Well, thank you very much.

[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.020]
I enjoy your show very much.

[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.680]
Okay, don't eat too much of that serial now.

[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:30.600]
I don't know.

[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:31.380]
Okay, it's good.

[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.300]
I'll be cabbage for you.

[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:32.600]

[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.100]
Yeah, bead.

[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.280]
Wow.

[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.900]
Yeah, there's a big story behind that Kellogg's breakfast serial.

[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:39.500]
Is there?

[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:39.940]
Yeah.

[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.240]
There really is, which I'm not going to go into today.

[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.120]
I don't need to.

[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.200]
But the original invention by Kellogg.

[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.160]
Oh.

[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:48.580]
Yeah.

[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.880]
Was to stop people from doing certain that we won't discuss today.

[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:52.140]
Yeah, right.

[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.600]
No, seriously, I'm not making that up.

[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.760]
So if you've been eating an awful lot of serial lately and you feel sexless, there's probably a pretty good reason for it.

[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.000]
Okay, let's take a call from Fort Lauderdale.

[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.240]
Hello.

[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.640]
Hey Neil, how's it going?

[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.300]
It's going.

[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.520]
I'm just curious what it gloves do.

[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.820]
Gloves 94.

[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.540]
Let's see, 12 plus.

[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:10.860]
They went from a 2-9 to a 3.

[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.020]
So they were kind of flat in the morning.

[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.780]
Greg and Donald in 12 plus.

[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.820]
Let's see if we can find the page.

[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.480]
They went from a 3-2 to a 3-1.

[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:25.040]
In any 25 to 54, they went from a 5-1, I think, to a 4-4, did I say?

[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:25.640]
Yeah.

[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.220]
4-4.

[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.960]
Sounds like the floundering, doesn't it?

[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.140]
Oh, come on now.

[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:30.540]
They're not.

[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:30.920]

[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.180]

[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:37.600]

[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:37.600]

[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:37.600]

[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.460]
Well, they haven't called, but they will.

[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.720]
They've extended the fig leaf of friendship or something.

[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:42.980]
Right.

[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.200]
Now that you're not on there.

[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:44.660]
Yeah.

[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.300]
When did the next trans come out?

[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.280]
I'm curious to see what's going to happen to Veda from 10 to 2.

[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.600]
From 10 to 2?

[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:51.680]
Yeah.

[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.180]
Or you mean 6 to 10?

[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.420]
Well, even 4 to 6 to 10, too.

[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:55.960]
I tell you.

[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.220]
I think, you know, he's really got Dave's got a hard job over there right now.

[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.580]
Yeah, he's got a chance for it.

[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.740]
I found my Kim and John really good long, that great.

[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.040]
Maybe they don't really do, but.

[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.240]
I think they're just having a little fun.

[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:07.980]
Oh, yeah.

[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.060]
While it lasts.

[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:09.520]
You do that.

[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.080]
Yeah, really.

[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:10.940]
That's what they keep talking.

[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.800]
It sounds like the breakfast club we visited.

[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.000]

[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:13.360]
It's temporary.

[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.240]
Yeah.

[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:14.320]

[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.140]
Like, you know, today was like what, ground zero or whatever.

[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.120]
I think, you know, they're waiting any moment to be canned.

[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:20.980]
Are you sure?

[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:21.240]
Oh.

[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.960]
Well, it sounds like it's the way they're talking and they were so depressed today.

[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.280]
I felt like I said, hey, you know, come on, guys.

[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.420]
Yeah, cheer up a little bit.

[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.160]
It's only a job.

[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.040]
Really?

[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.080]
Okay, well listen, we'll check it out for you.

[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:32.700]
Okay.

[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.520]
It'll be about a show and I'll be a loyal WIOD listener.

[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.820]
That's not what the big rating you and I want to see will be in about a month.

[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.300]
Yeah.

[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:41.820]
Okay.

[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.980]
Well, you know, there won't be any other station on, even on FM.

[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:45.620]
Okay.

[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:46.180]

[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.660]
afford five or ten bucks we understand that if you're one of the big shooters can afford fifty

[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.160]

[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:18.920]
a question about the rating but i have a suggestion i'm sorry for you i think surely before you

[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:24.960]
left the data you had a call not the struggling lady but you had a call from a lady that

[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:32.300]
the whole way through it's just hilarious she was quiet on top of what she wanted to say which

[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:38.120]
was totally irrelevant to anything but day was giggling in the background everybody was having a

[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:44.960]
good time you have that it you remember it was a recorded call can you give us it was i don't have it

[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.780]

[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.400]
um do they show up in here i don't they don't show up no they don't show up they're public

[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.280]
radio yeah they don't they don't show them i don't want to get a tm i i'm thinking of

[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:32.880]
another sued station okay tm i know wl already isn't with them because it's not a commercial station

[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.620]
and obviously they don't sell advertising because they always talk when they had their pledge weeks

[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:42.140]
and stuff they talk about their high ratings and stuff high ratings in one i have no idea well it's

[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:48.520]

they got geriatric demographics on the a m and invisible demographics on the f m but at least

[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:21.460]
they're consistent right well isn't the rule of thumb now is when zeta beach you you're in

[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:03.740]
he can't get my last name right rogers you know if these people out there think that's a dig when

[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:09.580]
they use my real name you know like uh milton burl changes name the jack bennie and most almost

[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:15.100]
everybody in show business who had a very difficult real name changes their name but somehow they

[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:20.060]
find that by writing to nelson that it's just like a wound you know to the heart like i really could

[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:27.000]
hear and it here he writes kneel in parentheses nelson uh by way of your chronic groupy hangers on

[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.400]
who have nothing to do when you switch stations but harass me at my business i heard you move

[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.820]
he heard we moved he heard it through the great yeah okay harvey of candle i guess i missed the

[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:41.780]
local blurbs as i was out of town and business when the news came out i guess i'll have to continue

[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:46.040]
to hear from you in this syrup to his manner as i haven't heard your show for almost a year

[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:52.080]
frozen dial yeah do you still do the sweet and low stick how is working with mr. sincerity

[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.760]
while i'm looking forward to your next career move as the x-rated messages your groupies leave

[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:02.240]
our real grin perhaps king could take them all and send them to george collin or the fcc

[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:10.340]
break a leg literally love you harvey and then he writes as a close script here we go if the

[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:16.760]

oh what a scythe humor harvey i knew you wouldn't let us down okay baby and i know you're listening

[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:28.740]
right now in spite of all your protestations mr. frozen dial yeah never listened on fm yeah

[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:33.640]
well it's because he's too stupid to find it that's right and of course the one fan that he was

[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.020]
able to find in town the big fan was uh uh Howard Kleinberg over there at the mime news right

[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:44.720]
and look what it did for them April wore the misunderstanding by now with a w i rubbed in their nose

[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:49.760]
oh no we should i mean to be able to go up like that under those conditions in the last month

[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:54.960]
i hope that the upper level management over there at zeta just um just takes all these numbers and

[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:01.920]
sticks them in their ear okay or wherever they fit 22-tail new to w i o d and we have a thing here a

hell plan yeah welcome to w i o d thank you so much sir uh listen wouldn't that program wouldn't

[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.860]
that station really round out pretty good if they had somebody like Debbie Ellis in there maybe

[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:30.440]
oh yeah it would round out the whole building would round out if they had Debbie Ellis could play

[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:35.240]
I've worried that yeah uh maybe if they cut out a little bit of man's it's in the gaki at night

[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:40.080]
and kind of slip there in there for a couple hours slip there in there yeah i think it worked out

[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.940]
well i'll tell leaf hour you said so okay yeah okay it's probably the world's number one Debbie Ellis

[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:49.500]
figure yeah oh well well i see only time i'll have a listen to Alice over there in any way is

[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:09.380]
that's true good good sense at you over and uh she does some pretty good topical stuff yeah well

[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:13.540]
everything is relative you know what i mean yeah yeah when especially when steve has got uh

[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.460]
278 wiod i'm not gonna give the Palm Beach line that's a waste of time yeah no steve has got some

[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:45.720]
pretty uh amazing shows on i didn't i did not hear i wonder why i didn't hear yesterday

[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.640]
he had the july well oh she had not shown up that's right i wonder why that is yeah it came late

[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.940]
because i was in the building to think anyway steve has open phones today

[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.840]
oh which is uh good i wish he had more open phones i don't want i don't i'm not gonna

[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.900]
interfere in steve's show and i don't want people calling and i is trying to run your show

[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:07.460]
i have nothing to do with that but i think that these guests see remember when i came to that

[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:12.220]
conclusion about two years ago year and a half and i decided that when you have a guest on

[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:17.700]
no matter who it is you immediately turn off a certain percentage of your potential audience

[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.520]
for example when you do baseball cards and i'm not saying that to pick on steve but

[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.940]
no seriously stop and think about it for a minute how many people are interested in that

[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:31.180]
not maybe five percent three percent of the whole audience and if that's three percent how many of

[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:36.040]
them are going to be listening on that particular day so you really do with these topics and

[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:42.080]
these guests blow out a lot of people but be that as it may steve has open phones today tomorrow he's

[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:47.900]
got the official english post-mortem on the uh english language referendum mark la porta and bob

[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:54.580]
bluer no not again are you serious mark la porta yeah for the eight million time at mark la porta

[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.860]
and like i said the other day i believe english is the language of this country and we shouldn't

[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:03.360]
have to keep wasting time arguing about it but people that want to carry it to a

[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:09.420]
just to a fanatical degree man these people i think are really you know off the off the wall

[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.380]
that's the nicest thing i can say speaking of off the wall Thursday on a cane show

[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:22.140]

[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:01.400]
back so we can do a little a bird can you got me into the mindset the

[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:05.000]
the the thinking along those lines look at that notice how they're starting to

[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.300]
drop off because it's close to the news this is a i'm telling you this is not a

[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:13.360]
dumb audience over here slow but not dumb and they understand when it gets close to

[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:18.000]
the top of the are they they scatter like flies like fruit flies they come back

[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.560]
and then as soon as we come back after the news they start coming back again

[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.540]
boy you close our really sharp is a month's ability to do that on that

[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:28.540]
them in my news was like two minutes well no in the beginning they didn't do it on

[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:32.420]
fm it took them months to figure out you know when the news was coming up

[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:35.840]
i went on one of those long breaks was coming yeah and we did have a lot of

[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.200]
business on the year over there too which i guess to stir them because they

[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:41.020]
didn't know how to handle it they didn't like it we were sold out for months

[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.240]
and we don't want to do so our great we don't want to spend weeks and weeks

[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.580]
ripping the crap out of the management of uh w's et a w i n z

[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:53.020]
over at guy gannett broad chasing but uh what can i say some people basically upper level

[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:57.120]
management there a bunch of douchebags and especially at the corporate level up in portland

[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:01.240]
main they give new meaning to the word douchebag okay i think everyone knows that he and

[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:07.360]
therefore pure panical uh mindless pretens you know some people have trouble dealing with success

[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.640]
i'm not the fact well no i said way back on a m that their whole thing there was mess with success

[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:15.980]
the more successful you were the more they would try to interfere with your show and give you a rough

[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:21.620]
time the people who like always failed who had minuscule numbers they loved them because they could

[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:25.980]
relate to them they loved them they love them alone they would just uh and they would never get

[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:30.460]
canned shall we say the statement that i said one day on the earth i got them apaparkh they gravitate

[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:35.940]
toward mediocrity they freaked when i said that i think i got too close to the truth

[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:42.160]
you hit a one nerve they grab it all forward mediocrity like i have never seen they love mediocre

[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.720]

[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:35.620]
i went away about two weeks ago i was going for ten days yeah and i knew you guys were leaving

[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:42.620]
data but i come back and we're not there anymore yeah thank god it's pretty loud but anyway i'm glad

[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:49.340]
i found you guys and uh that's about it just lots of luck here how did you find this was it different

[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:56.100]
how about that how about that what a surprise what a surprise and a fight for being like in the dark but

[00:46:56.100 --> 00:47:02.500]
with danger where is he oh he's still there oh he is yeah we left him on the ship we left him on

[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:07.060]
the Titanic as it was sinking thank you guys have really good friends well we didn't have any

[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:11.440]
choice you know you can't take the whole family all the time you know that's like well bad did he

[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:16.040]
well i don't know if you can talk about it if he okay about staying there well they're a little

[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:22.280]
bitter or something what do you mean bitter he seemed to be okay now i think he i think he's fine

[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:26.660]
because at least for the time being he and john afford are like the top bananas there at least for

[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:31.900]
right now in the morning so i don't think he's bitter he's got a shot at it and whether it's

[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:37.280]
permanent or not remains to be seen you know what i mean yeah but i you know i i never understood

[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:42.420]
like they got way to you guys because no no wait they didn't get rid of us we left let's make it

[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:48.180]
very clear we told them goodbye and they said okay i thought they gave you a hard time because

[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:53.860]
they were into this rock format and we don't want to be music and you don't fit in yeah and we

[00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:57.920]
couldn't coerce our listeners to listen to the crap that they're playing the rest of the day okay

[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:02.240]
see what i don't understand is they were pulling like one five or two's all day yeah if you were

[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:06.720]
the only bright spot so now what they're saying is it's going to improve our overall day to get

[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:10.100]
rid of you guys yeah it doesn't make any sense of course not it's the dumbest thing that anybody

[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:16.300]
ever heard of but then at least they're consistent okay don't i never saw anything like it my

[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:20.400]
whole life no and they did the same thing on am when they blew stand major out he was the biggest

[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:25.480]
thing they had going on am and they blew it up yeah yeah so they had to be consistently that the

[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:29.280]
only thing i really have against you guys oh and i'm sure there are a lot of people out there

[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:33.920]
yeah yeah that there's nothing to listen to in the morning oh you know somebody said that to

[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:39.360]
me the other day what do they want they want us on all day well just yeah i mean i guess if they

[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:43.940]
keep bringing food all day we could do it but enough is enough you know no it's okay i have to

[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:47.560]
listen to you guys at work and it's a good thing that people work for me so i can choose the

[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:51.860]
radius these exactly so they sort of clear out for it well but i get to listen to you guys but

[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.700]
there are a lot of people that did listen to you for drive time and now it's sort of like in the

[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:59.420]
middle of the day so they got to find you and all of that but well spread the word get that

[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:03.260]
sandwich board on and watch up in down the street there and let's spread the word and see

[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:09.000]
unlike you everyone else read it on the front page of the Miami Herald so i think they can find it

[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.500]
that's what i said i know i would be here but i would scare like my security blanket i mean you

[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:17.460]
aren't there in the morning and but the thing i do like is that you guys are playing all like the

[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:23.320]
great songs again there's this little biting edge and which is a lot of fun which is why i listen to you

[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:27.080]
like exactly this is why people you know the great miracle there were many miracles and i want to

[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:31.880]
sound like we're petting ourselves on the back even if we are but we work that's right we worked

[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:36.420]
under the most incredible technical duress for over a year with the worst crap equipment that

[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:41.260]
was ever ever invented even marconey was embarrassed by how primitive the stuff was in that room

[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:45.880]
in like in a little broom closet that was mostly uncomfortable and unwieldy and unworkable

[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:52.260]
secondly we were on a station and basically had no audience whatsoever you know and thirdly they

[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:56.680]
took away about 90% of our material and we still were going up in every book we still have

[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:01.080]
the friend come out today and we were at our highest number ever on there a five five that's

[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:04.760]
pretty fast under impossible condition do you imagine what we could have done if they would let us

[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:10.980]
alone no that would have been too easy for them yeah that would have made too much sense yeah but hey

[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:14.960]
you know at least you found the spot and there's no lookings out there for yourself well i'm glad you found

[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:20.540]

[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:26.480]
she was like our perfect female caller you know what i'm saying i mean nobody is perfect but she

[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:33.120]
was as close to a demographics sound of her voice she was like pleasant happy a lot of human yeah

[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:41.300]
and living and breathing as opposed to how wow Neil where's Paul Harvey yeah by the way Paul

[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:48.740]
Harvey is gone okay he's gone and he ain't coming back ever so if you're one of those

[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:53.240]

[01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:41.350]
like on on the edge of their seats at all times now they're on pins and needles i guess there

[01:01:41.350 --> 01:01:46.170]
anyway um yeah just on pins i think needles would not be the appropriate time i've been listening

[01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:50.510]
to you guys for a while you know when uh listen to Steve Austin he ought to say i'll take

[01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:54.550]
Neil on any time in the debate if i ever got together saying this and that and the first time

[01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:59.090]
can i answer sir slow down a second i ask you a question sure see every time he would say that

[01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:03.670]
and it would get back to me i'd always ask the person who relayed the message a debate about what

[01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:08.250]
what is there for me to debate him about following how he said i'm here so used to doing these

[01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:13.550]
contrived debates he thinks that life is a debate i know the day i have nothing to debate him about

[01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:17.830]
when he got together he that Friday was like a little puffy cat he melt him can't bring all

[01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:22.210]
over you exactly he loves this he loves this everybody's happy and i know that at that

[01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:25.230]
disappoints a lot of the audience are a lot of people out there who are looking for another

[01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:30.990]
hurrah-dote type fist fight but we're getting along great and he's been very kind and very gracious

[01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:35.950]
and everybody here has been that way and it's been great yeah we're not we're not looking to have

[01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:39.830]
a brawl on this station okay we like you know we like to have this little fun thing with the sports

[01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:44.330]
department because basically some of those guys deserve it but generally speaking everybody here

[01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:48.130]
gets along famously this is a real pleasant place to work and i'm not just saying that to be a

[01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:52.350]
buttkisser because you know i don't do that but it really is everybody's great you're speaking

[01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:56.210]
of brawl there's some great fights in the stands last night what that that was probably the most

[01:02:56.210 --> 01:03:00.710]
exciting part of the game there wasn't on you yeah anyway who do you like in the ls u my m game

[01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:06.650]
oh no come on you really have to ask me that you know one thing about the hurricanes and i don't

[01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:10.710]
want to pick on them too much but what they do is in a big notice in the beginning of the season

[01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:15.430]
they got like maybe two or three rough opponents and i say rough uh you know marginally and then

[01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:20.950]
after that then we got Cincinnati and all these other vassar and uh you know a wrensilier

[01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:25.270]

When you're not coming right now to listen to me.

[01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:49.870]
Well, that's one of the all-time grades, isn't it?

[01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:51.770]
Thank you, Jay. Could we cart that up?

[01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.730]
Great.

[01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:53.630]
Well, that would be great.

[01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:54.090]
That would be great.

[01:05:54.090 --> 01:05:54.790]
We'll play that every day.

[01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:57.970]
Jay, America, who has done so much great stuff for us,

[01:05:57.990 --> 01:06:00.190]
and I still say, I don't know why he's wasting his time.

[01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:02.890]
This guy should be putting out commercial stuff, shouldn't he?

[01:06:03.330 --> 01:06:07.450]
He's creative, great musician, and a wonderful all-around guy.

[01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.830]
And I just don't know why he's not making millions of dollars out there.

[01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:11.950]
But we appreciate it. We're going to milk him dry while we can.

[01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.230]

[01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:13.730]
And it's just great.

[01:06:14.010 --> 01:06:17.170]
Okay, listen, April, Wortham and Stint, because overall, now let me get these,

[01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:20.370]
we do have these numbers, and I want to, not like I'm standing up for Steve,

[01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:21.850]
because we work here, but that is the reason.

[01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:27.010]
But anyway, 12 plus, Alice had a 4-9 in his latest trend, and Steve had a 4-6.

[01:06:27.110 --> 01:06:28.930]
So it sounds like he beat him.

[01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:34.010]
But if you look at the demographics in 18 to 34, we already told you that Alice was deadlash,

[01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:38.790]
and Steve had a 2-something, a 2-1, which is not a big number,

[01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:40.030]
but again, it's an AM station.

[01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:43.630]
And Alice had a 0.4, so there's no contest there.

[01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:47.070]
In 25 to 54, Steve had a 4-9.

[01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:48.710]
Alice had a 2-0.

[01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:53.290]
In 35 to 64, Steve had a 6-6, and Alice had a 4-something.

[01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:58.810]
So the only place where he beat him, he had this gigantic 65-plus demographic.

[01:06:59.530 --> 01:07:02.590]
And I'm sure that Steve has tickled a death that, you know,

[01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:05.750]
if he's going to get beaten somewhere, it's 65-plus, because I hate to say this,

[01:07:05.810 --> 01:07:07.070]
but nobody wants that audience.

[01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:09.950]
Nobody wants that audience, okay?

[01:07:11.130 --> 01:07:13.950]
Even radio death doesn't want that audience.

[01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:16.650]
So Alice, if you're going to try to play little games with the numbers,

[01:07:16.830 --> 01:07:19.170]
it's not going to work, baby, because your audience is so old,

[01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:24.290]
it's the ancient audience that doesn't have enough strength left to reach over and turn the dial, okay?

[01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:26.430]
Those are the ones left at WS News.

[01:07:27.290 --> 01:07:29.370]
And Sandy's got this, I didn't realize it, man.

[01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:30.910]
She's been kicking some ass over there.

[01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:31.590]
No, no, no, no, no.

[01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:33.390]
12 plus, you've got a 5-1.

[01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:33.830]
Yeah.

[01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:34.450]
You will leave that.

[01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:37.850]
Wait, you see, and this station had a 3-1 in midday, but of course the dean is gone.

[01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:40.950]
But, and I bet her demographic's a ancient tomb.

[01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:42.150]
Should we check it out?

[01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:43.490]
Sure.

[01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:44.590]
18 to 34.

[01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:46.130]
Maybe she's right in there with Alice.

[01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:47.670]
Wait, you see the next one?

[01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:51.030]
18 to 34, WS News, while I haven't found them yet.

[01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:53.590]
I'm still looking, Sandy.

[01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:54.210]
Sandy.

[01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:55.650]
0.8.

[01:07:57.070 --> 01:08:00.650]
0.8, but I realize that's a young demographic.

[01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:01.110]
I know, right?

[01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:02.850]
Let's start at the bottom when you start.

[01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:03.910]
I'm just going to be relaxed now.

[01:08:04.070 --> 01:08:05.670]
I start to try to control yourself.

[01:08:06.270 --> 01:08:07.370]
25 to 54.

[01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:10.450]
These are the ages, by the way, for those of you two dumb to figure that out.

[01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:16.950]
A WS News, let's see, just behind Zeta, Gonser Beatem, they had a 1-8, Sandy.

[01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:18.950]
So what does that leave, basically?

[01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:22.590]
I mean, she has a gigantic, geriatric audience, okay?

[01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:26.030]
Here's somebody in Hollywood who wants to say hi to his dad.

[01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:26.470]
Hello.

[01:08:26.790 --> 01:08:27.290]
How you doing, Neil?

[01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:27.830]
Pretty good.

[01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:28.490]
What do you think this is?

[01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:30.110]
Is there some kind of a personal message, you know?

[01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:30.530]
Sure.

[01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:34.850]
I know why dad is listening, trying to try to understand what comes on top of everything he said.

[01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:37.170]
Great. Well, like I said, your dad's a great guy.

[01:08:37.350 --> 01:08:38.410]
Dad, can you call my dad, please?

[01:08:38.710 --> 01:08:39.210]
What is his name?

[01:08:39.370 --> 01:08:39.730]
His name is Ron.

[01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:41.810]
Hey, Ron, you're a douchebag in our book.

[01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:42.390]
Okay, baby.

[01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:43.150]
All right, thank you.

[01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:44.270]
Okay, you have a good day now.

[01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:45.370]
We'll be doing it all by far.

[01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:47.590]
I like these voices, man.

[01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:49.090]
And here we are, the seventh day on the air.

[01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:50.910]
We've already got these living and breeding people.

[01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:52.330]
If I can borrow that from Captain Dave.

[01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:54.870]
And it's incredible.

[01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.970]
It's frightening, isn't it?

[01:08:57.130 --> 01:08:57.950]
That's the word.

[01:08:58.290 --> 01:08:58.550]
Seriously.

[01:08:59.230 --> 01:09:01.250]
When they say that we can move an audience, man.

[01:09:01.890 --> 01:09:03.870]
This show is a moving experience.

[01:09:04.150 --> 01:09:08.350]
And believe me, Sunny Rosenberg and Helen Dale has got his finger on the radio right somewhere right now.

[01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:11.790]
Well, I can't believe the book we had over there.

[01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:15.530]
It's our going away book at Zeta, our highest number ever.

[01:09:16.150 --> 01:09:18.250]
Highest position in 18 to 34s.

[01:09:18.310 --> 01:09:19.370]
We kicked ass, beat everybody.

[01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:22.690]
Beat everybody again in 25 to 54s with that 71.

[01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:24.570]
And I know I'm repeating it over and over again.

[01:09:24.570 --> 01:09:26.210]
But it makes you feel good, okay?

[01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:33.710]
Because it makes you realize that you were like doing impossible things on a make-believe radio station that had virtually no measurable audience rest of the day.

[01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.050]
And then when you tell them, hey, stick it in your ear.

[01:09:36.150 --> 01:09:37.410]
We're not going to take your crap anymore.

[01:09:37.530 --> 01:09:38.330]
They say, hey, okay.

[01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:39.030]
Bye-bye.

[01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:39.930]
Boy, boy.

[01:09:40.190 --> 01:09:41.050]
They're glad to see us.

[01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:43.470]
Yeah, they were delighted, man, because they like to be consistent.

[01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:46.690]
They like, they were like their number to be like a straight line, okay?

[01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:48.010]
Well, like about a one, two.

[01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:49.370]
It's getting real.

[01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:50.330]
Morning, noon and night.

[01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:51.410]
And I got news for it.

[01:09:51.450 --> 01:09:52.310]
They may get their wish.

[01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:54.110]
Be careful what you wish for.

[01:09:54.730 --> 01:09:54.730]

[01:09:55.450 --> 01:09:57.490]
Okay, let's go to the...

[01:09:58.050 --> 01:09:58.930]
Hembrick Pines.

[01:09:59.070 --> 01:09:59.330]
Hello.

[01:09:59.710 --> 01:10:00.390]
Hey, Neil.

[01:10:00.670 --> 01:10:00.990]
Yeah.

[01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:01.670]
What's happening?

[01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:03.830]
Not too much, pal. We're just having a great time.

[01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:04.530]
Yeah, here.

[01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:07.730]
You had a good lunch. We're feeling great to show us, zipping along like lightning.

[01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:13.050]
Yeah, I was wondering if you were ever going to have another student day.

[01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:14.630]
Yeah, what day is the next holiday?

[01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:20.510]
I think that we have not just coming Wednesday, which would be tomorrow, but the next Wednesday.

[01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:21.650]
Yeah, for Thanksgiving, right?

[01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:22.150]
Yeah.

[01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.710]
Yeah.

[01:10:23.170 --> 01:10:23.990]
But before Thanksgiving.

[01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:25.990]
But don't do it then, because I'm going to be out of town.

[01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:27.550]
Oh, well, when do you want us to do it?

[01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:29.170]
Well, mark it on the calendar just for you, pal.

[01:10:29.370 --> 01:10:33.310]
Okay, I'll probably get it back to you after, and you know, I'll tell you when I'm going to be back.

[01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:34.450]
Oh, you know, where do you go to school?

[01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:35.470]
I got a BCC.

[01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:36.330]
Oh, the BCC?

[01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:37.510]
Well, that explains it.

[01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:41.730]
When you go to BCC, the world kind of revolves, you know, the way you want it to, right?

[01:10:42.170 --> 01:10:43.210]
That's what everybody tells me.

[01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.730]
Uh-huh.

[01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:48.850]
Well, you know, I figured, you know, since, you know, I was the faithful student day call, are you?

[01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:51.090]
You know, I might as well do it the way I want it.

[01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:53.350]
We'll do it the way you wanted if you know what I mean.

[01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:53.770]
Uh-uh.

[01:10:54.090 --> 01:10:55.270]
And I have a question for Gwen.

[01:10:55.570 --> 01:10:55.830]
Yeah.

[01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:57.490]
Gwen, how many ends do you have in your name?

[01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:57.990]
One.

[01:10:59.190 --> 01:10:59.550]
Really?

[01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:00.250]
I get asked that.

[01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:02.550]
I think that's some of the frequent question I may ask.

[01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:02.890]
Yeah.

[01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:05.350]
Why would you ask a dumb question like that?

[01:11:05.410 --> 01:11:06.590]
You sound like a really bright guy.

[01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:11.590]
Well, I figured, you know, you know, not that many people really ask Gwen a lot of things.

[01:11:12.090 --> 01:11:12.550]
Well, that's correct.

[01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:16.310]
And that probably is one of the most perspicacious questions that's been asked in a long time.

[01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:19.030]
Well, I figured I'd give Gwen as much action as possible.

[01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.970]
Well, I hear that.

[01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:20.270]
Yeah.

[01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:20.830]
Uh-huh.

[01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:23.490]
I'm going to send a little action this way, okay, pal?

[01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:23.770]
Oh, yeah.

[01:11:23.890 --> 01:11:24.370]
One more thing.

[01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:24.570]
Yeah.

[01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:26.450]
Could you call my friend Rick a douchebag?

[01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:27.770]
Rick is a douchebag.

[01:11:27.970 --> 01:11:29.510]
I know him personally and trust me.

[01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:32.110]
If you look up douchebag in the dictionary, his picture is there, okay?

[01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:34.530]
And as long as Gwen is on here, why don't you have him say it?

[01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:36.550]
Rick is a douchebag.

[01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:36.910]
Boy.

[01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:37.630]
Thank you, Gwen.

[01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:38.670]
You really want a lot.

[01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:39.230]
Don't you think?

[01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:39.550]
Okay.

[01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:41.170]
Take care of yourself now, okay?

[01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:41.950]
Bye-bye.

[01:11:42.170 --> 01:11:42.850]
He was good.

[01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:43.750]
He wants a lot.

[01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:44.930]
But that's where it goes.

[01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:47.290]
Boy, oh boy.

[01:11:47.410 --> 01:11:47.770]
What is it?

[01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:49.910]
Pressure showed today, wasn't it?

[01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:50.870]
Hasn't it been?

[01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:51.750]
Oh boy.

[01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:53.990]
Speaking like it's in the past tense or something.

[01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:55.770]
115 at WIOD.

[01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:57.810]
What is their name?

[01:11:58.670 --> 01:12:03.130]
His pizza in Jupiter will send a pie Thursday around noon time.

[01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:05.350]
Now, you know how long it takes to drive the Jupiter?

[01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:06.970]
From Jupiter, I'd say about an hour and a half.

[01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:08.130]
About an hour and a half.

[01:12:08.530 --> 01:12:10.270]
If the traffic's moving well.

[01:12:10.670 --> 01:12:13.610]
And we'll reheat it in the WIOD microwave, right?

[01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:14.390]
Yeah.

[01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:15.250]
And it'll be fine.

[01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:16.970]
Oh, it's going to be fine.

[01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:17.650]
It's going to be fine.

[01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:19.610]
Okay, it's 118 and we'll come back in a second.

[01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:21.070]
Steve with open phones just afternoon.

[01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:22.230]
Right now, I want to talk to you people.

[01:12:23.230 --> 01:12:24.410]
137 at WIOD.

[01:12:24.690 --> 01:12:26.210]
We got a mobile on Palm Beach.

[01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:26.510]
Hello.

[01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:27.550]
Dale, what's happening?

[01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:28.830]
Wow, what happened in town?

[01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.650]
Yeah, I love it.

[01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:30.330]
Hey, Neil.

[01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:31.870]
Am I doing the sawgrass?

[01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.550]
Yeah.

[01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:36.050]
Just got done, you know, right in a few letters.

[01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:38.570]
And why, why you're on the sawgrass?

[01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:40.710]
Yeah, cleaning out the car and I'm putting it to you.

[01:12:40.770 --> 01:12:43.090]
And the activities are ideas for me, you know?

[01:12:43.090 --> 01:12:43.450]
Yeah, so.

[01:12:43.930 --> 01:12:46.910]
Well, you might want to sweep up some of those dead frogs in the sawgrass too while you're

[01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:47.450]
out there, okay?

[01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:48.710]
There's nothing out here, Neil.

[01:12:48.850 --> 01:12:49.530]
I want them by myself.

[01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:49.970]
Yeah.

[01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:51.690]
Well, that's a great expressway, isn't it?

[01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:52.690]
The R-Wide Expressway?

[01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:53.450]
It's wonderful.

[01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:54.970]
Okay, Neil.

[01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:57.190]
So I'm giving you calls to the eye.

[01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.690]
Okay.

[01:12:57.850 --> 01:13:00.790]
Well, listen, next time you call it, give like the mile marker when you get your company out

[01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:02.690]
there and see which you can drop up a little party, okay?

[01:13:02.970 --> 01:13:04.110]
Hey, let me have some birds up.

[01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:04.570]
Yeah.

[01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:05.670]
Hey, bird, how you doing?

[01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:06.150]
Great.

[01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:08.450]
Hey, how's that April wording?

[01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:10.630]
You know, no, not worth it.

[01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:10.890]
I sure.

[01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:29.710]
I'm not going to get it.

[01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:29.830]

[01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.830]

[01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.830]

[01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:59.590]
Tire even that's exciting compared to the rest of what goes on here, right?

[01:27:59.790 --> 01:28:04.030]
Okay, okay, my name is art. Yeah, I just want to leave you one thing. You know what

[01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:10.190]
One if one is love right and two is sex what's three and four?

[01:28:11.290 --> 01:28:11.690]
Wow

[01:28:12.570 --> 01:28:17.450]
Go ahead, are you am I gonna have to dump this right am I gonna have to dump this? Yeah?

[01:28:19.150 --> 01:28:21.070]
What a guy have a great day art

[01:28:21.070 --> 01:28:26.210]
Bye, and listen when you get your own show you can use it like that. Okay. Here's another candle call. Hello

[01:28:26.210 --> 01:28:29.410]
Oh, how are you? How you doing babe? Yeah, I gotta tell you yesterday

[01:28:29.410 --> 01:28:33.090]
Or maybe day before I don't remember I was the mother was waiting for that

[01:28:33.090 --> 01:28:38.070]
EBS. Oh, yeah, come on there. Listen to this tape. I want I

[01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:42.470]
I've been hanging on for a while. I have that luck with the directional

[01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:47.190]
Well, it sounds like we're gonna be getting a lot of those in the mail if you know what I mean

[01:28:52.570 --> 01:28:57.270]
Once we get that we still have to run that by a spike, you know, and make sure that that's kosher

[01:28:57.730 --> 01:29:03.950]
We don't play anything here until we get the green light. I believe it and so far the light has been so green man that it's frightening

[01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:08.330]
I have a bunch of other things to say but to be honest with you hanging on for 35 minutes

[01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:12.450]
I know you forget your material, but it was good that you got on though, wasn't it? Yeah, it was great

[01:29:12.450 --> 01:29:17.390]
Especially since I've only disconnected myself and got right back on again after I you know gave the

[01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:20.930]
Thought story and stuff. Yeah, yeah, Nick goes big for those soft stories

[01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:24.070]
That's because he used to work at WS news and that was a soft story

[01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:28.390]
I always worked yeah, but unfortunately my material could not come back to me

[01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:32.570]
Okay, well, listen you have a great day and don't feel bad about it because it happens to most of our callers

[01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:35.110]
Okay, most of them didn't have any to start with

[01:29:35.710 --> 01:29:41.170]
You got it have a good one now. Thank you. Bye-bye. Well, he was good, wasn't he? Great. No, he was honest

[01:29:41.170 --> 01:29:44.090]
He admitted he had nothing to say and I like that kind of refreshing honesty

[01:29:44.850 --> 01:29:47.690]
Anyway, Steve is in the building and Steve has four open hours today

[01:29:47.690 --> 01:29:53.290]
And he had that real menacing BDI look in his eyes when he came in here just briefly and I have a feeling that he's gonna

[01:29:53.290 --> 01:29:55.550]
Really let it all out. He's been holding a lot of stuff back

[01:29:55.930 --> 01:29:59.270]
But he's gonna let it out today, you know what I'm saying? They're waiting for that open day

[01:29:59.270 --> 01:30:03.890]
I don't have any idea what I mean, but it sounds good and anyway, we want to thank no seriously

[01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:07.610]
We kind of closed the chapter on Zeta there. We got did you get your check? No

[01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:14.410]
I have not I checked the mail very carefully yesterday very carefully you still have it because I got mine

[01:30:14.410 --> 01:30:17.730]
Yeah, I know what does that say you didn't get your last check?

[01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:18.830]
I have not gotten well

[01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:22.050]
I would call there when I leave here today or before you leave and say hey, you know

[01:30:22.410 --> 01:30:24.310]
Maybe there's a little oversight on your part

[01:30:25.150 --> 01:30:29.010]
Do you think I should check the mail one more day? Okay, go home and check the mail one more time because you know

[01:30:29.010 --> 01:30:31.250]
You live down there in unincorporated

[01:30:31.250 --> 01:30:36.050]
Whatever I do I live all you live like in a cow pasture come on you live in a tropical jungle

[01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:39.430]
He over saw where he lives man in a rain forest

[01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:44.670]
It's just the way I like with these strange creatures on three legs and really good darn stuff going on

[01:30:44.670 --> 01:30:49.890]
But anyway, we want to thank everybody for you know really supporting us at Zeta during those closing

[01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:54.770]
Traumatic weeks and for helping us to leave there we can look at all these numbers and say hey

[01:30:54.770 --> 01:30:58.370]
We did our thing and if it wasn't to write people stick them where the moon don't shine

[01:30:58.370 --> 01:31:00.190]
You know basically a nice friendly thing like that

[01:31:00.190 --> 01:31:01.670]
Well, it's gonna have a wonderful day

[01:31:01.670 --> 01:31:07.430]
We'll be back again tomorrow from 10 to 2 and run around with sandwich boards and up and down Lincoln Road Mall and tell all your friends because

[01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:12.510]
We need that word to get out you know, especially up in Palm Beach call up Lee and talk about us on the air

[01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:16.810]
Yeah, and stay tuned for Steve. He's next here on 610 W I O D
