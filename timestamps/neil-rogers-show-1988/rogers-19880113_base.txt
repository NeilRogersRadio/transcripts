[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]
Well, Creep Men 25 to 54 were number one with a seven-shared.

[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:04.600]
Yes.

[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.640]
The ETR got a 6-1.

[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.160]
Great.

[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.640]
Number one.

[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.480]
Let me say it again.

[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.660]
Being number one in anything on this station, it's a revolutionary.

[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.420]
Well, certainly is the record breaking.

[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.700]
OK, here's 25 to 54 men and women.

[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.500]
We had a four-nine or fifth in the market.

[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.140]
And two of the stations were Spanish language.

[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:21.780]
That's great.

[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.760]
And GTR had a four-two.

[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.340]
Great.

[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.980]
11th.

[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.700]
So thank you for checking it.

[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.260]
Beat the crap out of Herman and McQueen.

[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.280]
I just mentioned that in passing because they keep saying,

[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.940]
what is that promo say?

[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.580]
Music in the morning in Herman McQueen.

[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.780]
What a concept.

[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.560]
What a concept.

[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.140]
What a concept.

[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.820]
Evidently not a concept that wins.

[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.760]
What concept?

[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.880]
A bad concept.

[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.480]

[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.420]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.360]
I'm going to say it better myself.

[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.960]
Yeah.

[00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.580]
627 on Zeta 4.

[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.040]
And again, we got a collect call and Brown and G.

[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.080]
We better get that right on.

[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.400]
Hello.

[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.840]
I don't tell me they hung up on a collect call.

[00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.140]
They could.

[00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.220]
How stupid can you be?

[00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.980]
How can you be calling collect and hang up?

[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.260]
Where was that from, John?

[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.400]
You know, Walter Blugonia.

[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.460]
There's a big sigh of relief in Portland, Maine.

[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.040]
I'll try to thank.

[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.640]
I mean, he's been there for about half an hour.

[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.600]
Well, he's gone now.

[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.460]
Long gone.

[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.700]
We ran up a good build.

[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.180]
It's OK.

[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.600]
Did we really?

[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.260]
It was Kelly.

[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.600]

[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.840]
Well, it'd probably be in your paycheck.

[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.880]
It'd probably be deducting the long distance cause

[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.480]
that we take collect.

[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.100]
We do have a Broward line open right now.

[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.200]
If you go to school at Hollywood Hills, I, at 777-93600.

[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.040]
Now, weren't some of these kids supposed to report back

[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.700]
to us this week?

[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.140]
Yeah.

[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.200]
They were supposed to pull their peers here.

[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.200]
Pull your peers.

[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.540]
Yeah.

[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.880]
That's an interesting line.

[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.420]
I like that.

[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.880]
I like that.

[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.020]
Pull your peers.

[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.700]
That's what they say in the Olympics at the

[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.720]
Apollo competition.

[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.240]
Pull your peers.

[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.640]
That's what the gladiators used to say.

[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.240]
Anyway, moving right along, let's go to the date, Kathy.

[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.600]
Hello.

[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.280]
Neil.

[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.600]
Good morning.

[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.100]
Wonder what happened to a more junior junior?

[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.460]
Is this a cake junior junior?

[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.680]
Yeah.

[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.420]
I was trying to get in contact with you.

[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.740]
You believe your lines are busy even from where I was trying to track.

[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.480]
I got to try to control your track.

[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.240]
I know you've seen the numbers for WS News and it's hard to control.

[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.980]
I didn't.

[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.260]
I just got back yesterday.

[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.760]
Well, really?

[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.080]
Well, I can tell you anything you want.

[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.140]
And of course, we can put the audience back to sleep again.

[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.620]
But that's a, we like to gloat.

[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.840]
Do you have any, do you know the gerbos are cheap in the Middle East?

[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.580]
I'm sure they are.

[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.100]
Why is that?

[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.840]
Well, I wanted to send you something, but they wouldn't let us.

[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.620]
The Middle East.

[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.780]
Yeah, I got a great letter here, by the way, which I'm saving for a little letter, a little

[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.080]
letter.

[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.360]
And it's got a brochure here about Milkfed Veal and the letter besieges me not to eat

[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.020]
Veal anymore.

[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.640]
I guess I can't eat dinner at Jamie and Marcie's anymore, right?

[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.180]
I'm going to give it to Glenn, Neil, he is.

[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.800]
Yeah, he, in fact, he's annoying on the brochure right now.

[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.980]
So anyway, what do you want?

[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.100]
Well, you had the 39, right?

[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.520]
Right.

[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.900]
Well, that means you did wonderful.

[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.800]
Yeah, that means we did about a five in December and about a four.

[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.160]
Or something.

[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.620]
And if we wouldn't have had that month of October to be saddled with, we would have done

[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.460]
in the fours.

[00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.980]
So the 1.90, right?

[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.300]
Whatever it was, October was the one that was going on.

[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.120]
Was that what it was?

[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.680]
I think so.

[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.360]
Yeah.

[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.520]
Unmongerable.

[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.840]
Yeah.

[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.180]
Let me ask you, well, I have a prediction.

[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.160]
I think it'll go up.

[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.620]
I think it'll add about another three.

[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.200]
Three points?

[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.980]
Another three points.

[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.420]
You think we can do close to a seven?

[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.120]
Well, what, how old should I be in every mind?

[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.820]
Just joking.

[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.980]
What is that?

[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.360]
How old should he be?

[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.300]
How old should I be?

[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.620]
Oh, for the old 25 to 54.

[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.260]
Oh, okay.

[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.160]
I'll make sure I'm 25.

[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.920]
Oh, I see.

[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.220]
Yeah.

[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.900]
Very good.

[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.400]
It's amazing the rotation on that stuff.

[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.460]
This is not WINZ, by the way.

[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.760]
I just want you to keep that in mind.

[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.380]
How did they do here and there in the morning show?

[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.160]
What do you mean here and there?

[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.460]
What does that mean?

[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.720]
You want to know, are you just going to keep babbling?

[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.140]
Okay.

[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.480]
They had a fourth three.

[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.680]
That's good.

[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.460]
How that happened?

[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.200]
Well, like I said, I think a lot of diaries got confused.

[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.940]
I could be wrong, but I think a lot of people put down the erudges WINZ.

[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.000]
Really think so.

[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.620]
I've got everybody.

[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.780]
I talk to you, single person.

[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.840]
Well, if it's at work and it must be the older crowd, you have a lot of older people.

[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.040]
We don't have any of them, so they must be confused.

[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.000]
But they've been confused.

[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.380]
I don't think other people are confused.

[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.180]
No, they know.

[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.260]
They can relate to say that.

[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.640]
If you're like under the age of 100, you can understand it.

[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.540]
Well, I don't know.

[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.260]
I think they might have something going for that and over there.

[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.180]
What's that?

[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.580]
I don't know, but I just say they might have something.

[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.720]
What's it have to do?

[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.540]
I haven't heard it.

[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.120]
I'll tell you that.

[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.580]
Can we call a police tower?

[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.340]
Oh, gee.

[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.140]
I left the number at home.

[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.360]
I have the number right here.

[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.260]
Oh, my God.

[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.540]
I want to be good friends with Lena.

[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.440]
We're buddies now.

[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.840]
Are you really?

[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.400]
Yes.

[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.560]
Boy, you're ready to come back with him, I'll tell you.

[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.140]
You won't mind if I dial his number to you.

[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.420]
You're going to dial the number?

[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.760]
Yeah.

[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.560]
This or an awkward little later.

[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.340]
Don't call him now.

[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.760]
This is me.

[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.080]
Give me the number and I'll call him later.

[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.440]
I'll dump.

[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.320]
Okay.

[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.320]
I hope somebody who really hates him has heard it unfolds.

[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.700]
Now, come on.

[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.780]
There's actually a lot of Lee right now.

[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.700]
Don't do it.

[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.360]
Don't do it.

[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.700]
Please.

[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.580]
I don't want to hold you on a...

[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.380]
How did your good friend, Roby, young do?

[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.260]
Oh, good.

[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.080]
Oh, Roby, yeah.

[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.800]
I wonder if they let him out again.

[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.500]
Yeah.

[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.680]
You see, I'm work-release.

[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.660]
Well, let me look it up.

[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.620]
60 to 10 a.m.

[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.240]
In fact, we didn't even look at the cat.

[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.480]
The cat must have really had some book, you know?

[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.220]
Yeah, I liked it.

[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.460]
Yeah, that's a good question.

[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.340]
Let's see, how far...

[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.420]
How down...

[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.220]
Does this go?

[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.960]
Is it...

[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.200]
Well, good question, Mr. Cake.

[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.320]
I'll tell you, W.H.D. J did well.

[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.200]
Yes, they did.

[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.600]
Pretty well.

[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.280]
Isn't that amazing?

[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.060]
Yes, they did.

[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.180]
Well, that old wave?

[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.000]
Yeah.

[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.920]
Here's the cat.

[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.760]
Oh, man.

[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.540]
Roby...

[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.600]
Oh, gee.

[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.380]
In the summer book, they had a two-five in the morning.

[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.000]
Are you there?

[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.400]
Yeah.

[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.400]
Are you standing up or sitting down?

[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.460]
Roby had a point eight.

[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.060]
Oh.

[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.280]
Yeah.

[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.060]
Oh, that hurts.

[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.580]
So, you know that old saying, we used to have, when I worked there,

[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.360]
catch the cat, I think somebody did.

[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.440]
And I think he's in the microwave right now in this piece.

[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.960]
How was the W.H.D. W.H.D. W.H.D. An end, the Neal Factor?

[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.040]
They can't seem to motivate anybody.

[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.700]
They had, I think, like a point three.

[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.940]
So, the motivation station doesn't seem to be motivating too many people to listen to them.

[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.580]
Well, that's a problem.

[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.080]
That's because you're no longer...

[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.260]
Yeah, that's for the Neal Factor.

[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.900]
They'll have to move over to FN now.

[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.240]
I guess.

[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.980]
They'll have to move, like, about 95.1 or something.

[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.880]
Could you give out the AM-totted...

[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.260]
How did my cantony do?

[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.300]
How did the IOD do?

[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.600]
Well, Reneer, he did pretty well in the morning.

[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.900]
You know, obviously, what did he have?

[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.440]
4-7, I think.

[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.820]
Where do you see that?

[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.600]
Oh, I see, I'm on 25 to 54.

[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.420]
There are so damn many things here, you know.

[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.760]
It's just too confusing for my nimble mind.

[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.960]
Well, Mr. K. Kow's Barbie doing.

[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.820]
I haven't spoken or you can call up if you want me to.

[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.440]
I'll give her a buzz.

[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.060]
No, no, no, come on, leave these poor people alone.

[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.140]
No, I'll leave her alone.

[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.940]
Okay, Brunner, he had a 4-7 and more.

[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.520]
No, I wonder, I haven't looked at that.

[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.780]
I wonder what Bill McQuig did in midday.

[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.000]
Oh, what two, something.

[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.360]
I wonder what Sandy did in midday.

[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.340]
I think Sandy had a...

[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.280]
What Sandy on the air?

[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.540]
I think a 2-7.

[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.920]
Okay, here it is.

[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.680]
Here's that midday.

[00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.740]
Alice, by the way, is like out of business.

[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.340]
Yeah.

[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.100]
Uh...

[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.140]
Gee, I can't seem to find him in here midday.

[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.000]
W.S. News, 2-7 to a 3.

[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.380]
That's Sandy with that big number.

[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.280]
And the Bill McQuig from a 2-0 to a 2-4.

[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.720]
Boy, he's really getting there slowly but surely, man.

[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.720]
He's making serious inroads.

[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.460]
How did they do overall?

[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.720]
Because you remember this was one year ago and they had that 4.0.

[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.080]
Oh, well, this is the dolphin book.

[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.860]
Here we go.

[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:24.900]
Do I even have that?

[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.020]
This is their highest book of the year every year.

[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.640]
And they always say that's just a coincidence.

[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.400]
Yeah, sure.

[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.480]
Here it is.

[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.840]
12 plus 6am to midnight, okay?

[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.600]
W-I-O-D from a...

[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.580]
Oh, from a 2-0 to a 3-6.

[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.160]
Ooh.

[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.740]
So they went up to the dolphin book, I've always do,

[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.640]
but that's like last year.

[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.040]
Yeah.

[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:44.960]
But...

[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.840]
It's the same every year.

[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.100]
Yeah.

[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.920]
So is that it?

[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.760]
I hope...

[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.760]
Well, you didn't give out your cohorts as news and wins.

[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.820]
And that's what I'm gonna hang down.

[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.480]
What the what?

[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.380]
Give out what?

[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.840]
What number do you want?

[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:58.520]
Overall.

[00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.300]
Overall.

[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.520]
Is that all you want, do you think?

[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.880]
I had Jay Michaels, of course.

[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.320]
I already told that.

[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.500]
He had a 4-6 down from a 7-5,

[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.160]
but he kept more than half the audience,

[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.400]
which is quite a miracle.

[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.300]
That will be a person.

[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.600]
If you heard that show.

[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.000]
What am I looking for now?

[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:13.800]

[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.760]
Oh, see, he's got me just so confused.

[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:16.760]
Come down.

[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.440]
Okay, here we go. Overall, let's see.

[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.020]
W-I-N-Z had a 3-9 down from a 5.

[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.240]
So what the hell is their story?

[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.200]
What's the big deal that they were so excited about?

[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.820]
Yeah, they're gonna have a 3-6.

[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.540]
W-I-O-D had a 3-6.

[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.700]
W-S-N-U-S.

[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.000]
A 3-5.

[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.240]
They're all right together.

[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.200]
Yeah, they're all kind of like glumped together.

[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.640]
And I have one last question.

[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:38.880]
Please.

[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:39.980]
Please.

[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:40.620]

[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:41.100]
Please.

[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.220]
H-Y-I.

[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.280]
What?

[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.400]
Oh, that's a good question.

[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:44.860]
Why 100?

[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:45.540]
Yes.

[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:46.800]
Howdy-Ball.

[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:47.880]
Well, they spent a lot of money,

[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:48.940]
and let's see if it paid off.

[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.500]
They went from a 3-3 to a 3-8.

[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:51.400]
Hmm.

[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.260]
How'd that happen?

[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.380]
Well, I guess they have that 10-year-old program director.

[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.340]
He must know what he's doing.

[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:57.560]
Yeah, he's good.

[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.540]
You see, he's commercial.

[00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.400]
He's really good.

[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.200]
I like him, yeah.

[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.100]
What are we doing wrong?

[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:01.780]
What should we do?

[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.540]
What should we play?

[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.460]
Where should we go?

[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.620]
Yeah, I'm going to call him a little later and tell him where to go.

[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.000]
Yeah.

[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.560]
Let me tell you something.

[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.560]
Was there anything yesterday in the Harold about rhythm 98 being sold?

[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.720]
That's the stuff that's going on.

[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.020]
Yes.

[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.600]
There was an article yesterday, so grab the...

[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.580]
Wait, let me ask you a question.

[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.120]
Do you know who's responsible for all that?

[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.360]
For all what?

[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.500]
All the stuff that's going on over there.

[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.940]
All the stuff that's going on over there.

[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:23.940]

[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.140]
Yeah, they were supposed to be changed in the 12th.

[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.240]
Yeah, they're going to go Spanish.

[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.100]
They're going to go Spanish, Mr. Dick.

[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.200]
Yeah, they're going to go Spanish, Mr. Dick.

[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:34.620]
Yeah, they're going to Spanish.

[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:34.800]
Yeah, they're going to Spanish.

[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.900]
I was supposed to happen a long time ago.

[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.240]
It was blown down like...

[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:39.900]
It was preaching hard.

[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.220]
So I'm just asked, who was responsible for it?

[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.640]
For what?

[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.480]
I was, never mind.

[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:47.980]
You'll hear about it.

[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:48.640]
Just call it the old.

[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.880]
No, no, no, no.

[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.580]
Okay, is that it?

[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.540]
That's it.

[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:51.780]
Yeah.

[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.500]
Okay, Junior.

[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.440]
I've sent you a trouble.

[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.180]
Thank you, sir.

[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.800]
It's 24-till-7 on Zeta 4th in the Aarajus Show.

[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.740]
We apologize, but after every book comes out,

[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.780]
we have to put up with the Fruitcake Junior.

[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.580]
It's one show in every three months.

[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.060]
I mean, that's how I was a big deal.

[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:06.740]
He's in the end of life.

[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:07.560]
And he's okay.

[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.420]
He's harmless.

[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:09.260]
Oh, yeah.

[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.200]
By the way, guys, I've got a cat update.

[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.100]
By the way, Hank Williams, Junior Junior called it,

[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.020]
says, but couldn't hold on.

[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:15.560]
Is that correct?

[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.380]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.100]
He couldn't hold on.

[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.280]
It slipped out of his hands.

[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:18.900]
I see.

[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.460]
Well, no comment on that.

[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.240]
You have a cancho?

[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.560]
Yeah, well, you said, uh...

[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.280]
Gee, I sure miss being over there.

[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.980]
Yeah, how about that?

[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:27.400]
Yeah.

[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.240]
We're sorry.

[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.420]
Yeah, how about that?

[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:30.980]

[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.180]
I bet he does.

[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.760]
What did the cat do overall?

[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.760]
Should we look at that number?

[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.600]
Is that 2D press?

[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.200]
Oh, it's just curious.

[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.080]
Let's see.

[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.040]
She was down to a 1-7 minute.

[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:40.480]
Really better.

[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.020]
They're finished.

[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:41.520]
Yeah.

[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.300]
They are DOA at Chee, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.060]
In fact, all their bumper stickers overnight say,

[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.560]
Chee used to be rock and roll.

[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.000]
Chee's...

[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.920]
Chee's B...

[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.820]
or whatever it says.

[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.440]
Here's the cat.

[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.020]
Down to a...

[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.880]
Oh, gee, are they doing it or what?

[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.640]
From a 2-4 in the summer book to a 0.7.

[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:00.200]
Ooh.

[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:01.500]
Wow.

[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.580]
That Howard Primer, man, is he...

[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.960]
Is he radio or is he radio?

[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:05.200]
Point.

[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.080]
Seven.

[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:06.580]
No, seriously.

[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.820]
I mean, you look at him and you see radio when you look at Howard.

[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:10.440]
That's a tough...

[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:11.480]
That hurts.

[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.640]
Now, what was I looking for, Jim Kelly on the cat?

[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.620]
Well, how big could it be if they did a 0.7?

[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.100]
Yeah, that's probably a good looking page.

[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:17.600]
Yeah.

[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.540]
Well, let's see how she did.

[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:21.960]
Um...

[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.780]
Oh, whom I looking for?

[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.540]
Jim Kelly.

[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:23.940]
Oh.

[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.120]
Let's see, down from a 2-5 to a 1.

[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.160]
But if he had a 1, I was probably their big number.

[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:29.720]
Yeah, probably.

[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.220]
His robe he had, like, a point A.

[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.100]
I think they need to get Jack McDermott back and straighten that plate out.

[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.520]
Play some of those Edison's own day that Jack likes so much from his personal collection.

[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.340]
23-4-7 on Zeta 4, we do have an open line in date at 620-3600.

[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.580]
Why don't you do a break here?

[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.960]
We have to just do a short break and then we'll come back.

[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.680]
The most classic rock.

[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.680]
Chee's a bus of e.

[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.380]
You know, the kids just keep getting the hard...

[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.800]
This morning we've been punching their buttons as they say on some shows.

[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.060]
Let me say it again as they say on...

[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.080]
I wonder why they didn't fire.

[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.500]
Like what show, for example?

[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.740]
I wonder why it didn't fire.

[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:09.680]
St.Mitches.

[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:11.280]

[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.420]
St.Mitches.

[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.540]
Talking about St.Mitches.

[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:21.000]
Now, not the numbers have come out and we congratulate St.Mitches on his usual steady job there, man.

[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.880]
You know what? Right around a 4-3-9 right in there beating the daylights out of Mr. Ego and Alice.

[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.460]
Alice is like history.

[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.440]
I know this.

[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.760]
2-5.

[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.080]
I never hear one any way.

[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.260]
What did you ever say anything about?

[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.200]
I haven't turned that station on in so long my radio would probably...

[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.400]
It would probably keep scanning if I punched up that button.

[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.080]
I don't think the signal's strong enough to stop your radio.

[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:46.720]
That's an interesting point.

[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.800]
When you punch scan on a car radio, it stops or is it seek?

[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.000]
One of the other, I get confused.

[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:57.000]
But it stops on stations that are strong enough with this signal to lock in.

[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:57.640]
That's correct.

[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.160]
And the W snooze is no longer that strong.

[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.160]
Questionable, yeah.

[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:02.220]
Questionable.

[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:02.960]
Yeah, close.

[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.120]
If you have a strong car radio at light.

[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.180]
I haven't seen Rick Edwards, our corporate chief engineer around here lately.

[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.860]
Maybe he's the new engineering honcho over there.

[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.140]
Maybe he is to get all the credit for their technical success.

[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.860]
Because if anybody could do it, no.

[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.700]
No, I'm just going to be just hanging out here today.

[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.640]
I'm tower number 4.

[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:25.620]
OK, let's take another call and the lines are all just either tied up or ringing or flashing or doing something.

[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:31.220]
We're going to be calling Lee Fowler a little bit to get his first vacation's observations on these latest ratings.

[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.280]
Yeah, we want to hear what he had his strictly objective views.

[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.740]
Oh yeah, I'm going to stick here.

[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.360]
The last thing Steve is probably hanging out over there this morning.

[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:38.840]
Uh-huh.

[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.140]
Dave Chawhi, hello.

[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:40.900]
Yeah.

[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:41.480]
Yeah.

[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.900]
I call you wine and then you...

[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.260]
I've been holding for an hour and I'm from Killian.

[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.260]
Are you serious?

[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:47.480]
Yes.

[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.140]
How come you didn't tell Captain Dave you're from the early morning?

[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.360]
The early Captain Dave was that other guy.

[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.200]
Oh, that John Ford maybe, I can't believe it.

[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.080]
I've been holding some 620.

[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.620]
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.320]
What if you don't like it?

[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.800]
Now I have a good excuse not to go to school.

[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.080]
Yeah, that's a good idea.

[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.820]
Now, didn't we do a public service for you today?

[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:04.220]
Sure.

[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.260]
I mean, was there anything special going on in school today?

[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.880]
Nothing really, just a normal dope smoking and the beach.

[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:11.720]
Exactly.

[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.100]
So you're not going to miss anything.

[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:15.540]
Are they going to miss you?

[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.080]
No, I don't care if they don't miss me or not.

[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.880]
Right, like what's greater you win?

[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.020]
I'm in the 11th.

[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.140]
Oh, you're a junior then.

[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.080]
That's what we want.

[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.800]
We're going to hear from a lot of juniors today.

[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.240]
You're right.

[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.840]
Like Hank Williams Jr.

[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.260]
And what's his name?

[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.580]
More Downey Jr. Jr.

[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:30.860]
Yeah.

[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:31.700]
Junior Junior.

[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.000]
Yeah.

[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.640]
Oh, Steve Sonsky Jr.

[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.060]
Steve Sonsky Jr. is good.

[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.640]
We'll probably hear from Joe Johnson Jr.

[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.920]
So, live the Thornton Jr.

[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.400]
Maybe even Tom Jicke Jr.

[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.080]
We'll be calling him.

[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.300]
Wow, that looks like a family Ross Jr.

[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.700]
No, I do want to hear from her.

[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.560]
And we'll get a call from Frank Motek Jr.

[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.240]
So what are you going to do today?

[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.680]
You're going to be on Miami Vice next tomorrow.

[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.420]
Who is?

[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:53.840]
I think.

[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:54.580]
Who is?

[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:56.360]
What?

[00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.380]
Who?

[00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:58.540]
He's Sonsky.

[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.340]
He's going to be on Miami Vice tomorrow.

[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.500]
Oh, he's going to be like a bartender.

[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.700]
Oh, what's he going to do impersonating a human being?

[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.480]
It's just a joke, Steve.

[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:05.940]
You're okay.

[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.620]
He's not a bad guy.

[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.220]
What does he like your father or something?

[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.660]
So what are you going to do all day?

[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.460]
Just going to hang out?

[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.360]
Yeah, probably watch the regular fill and all that stuff.

[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.200]
Watch what?

[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.140]
Not on.

[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:17.420]
Oh, no.

[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:17.460]
Oh, no.

[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:17.500]
Oh, no.

[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:17.540]
Oh, no.

[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:17.760]

[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:17.760]

[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:17.860]
Oh, no.

[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:17.980]
Oh, no.

[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:17.980]

[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.000]
Oh, no.

[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.160]
Oh, no.

[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:18.220]
Oh, no.

[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.620]
Oh, no.

[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.140]
Oh, no.

[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:20.480]
Oh, no.

[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:20.480]

[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:20.620]
Oh, no.

[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:21.700]
Oh, no.

[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.140]
Oh, no.

[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.600]
Oh, no.

[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.780]
Oh, no.

[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:31.980]
Oh, no.

[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.440]
Oh, no.

[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.520]
I'm asking a woman that went to study her baby.

[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.580]
You don't know who Kate Junior, do you, buddy?

[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:45.920]

[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:46.980]
Hahaha.

[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.200]
Yeah.

[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:50.720]
For her senior?

[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.260]
I don't hang out with your friends, Neil.

[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:52.800]
Okay.

[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.800]
Well, listen, I'm glad we did you.

[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.320]
No, no, I got a couple things to tell you.

[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:56.840]
Okay.

[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:57.740]
Okay, let's look into this.

[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.920]
So, we're going to see Steve Kane tomorrow.

[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:00.520]
Yeah.

[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.800]
Male strippers from the Crazy Horse.

[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:03.560]
Hmm.

[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:04.460]
Are you serious?

[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.580]
I am serious.

[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.000]
I'm looking at the back of the TV guys.

[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.280]
Oh, my God.

[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.260]
And now I run till tomorrow, topic.

[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.680]
like, cheering homeless sexuals.

[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.560]
Curying homeless sexuals?

[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:14.760]
Yes.

[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.920]
On the Alice Ranch El Show, I don't know.

[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.780]
Yeah, well how can you curious yourself though, you know?

[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.680]
It'll be quite an experience, huh?

[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.060]
Yeah.

[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.820]
I guess I better tune in for that one, having a bad.

[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.620]
I better take the cure.

[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.380]
I don't know if you can pick it up or not.

[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.860]
No, I probably won't be able to hear it,

[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.820]
but I'll just put my dial on that spot

[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.060]
and pretend that I'm hearing it.

[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.520]
Maybe I'll get some psychic vibrations.

[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.060]
So who's gonna be on that show?

[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:38.520]
I don't know.

[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.100]
Yeah, that's the question.

[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:40.780]
Mike Thompson.

[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.480]
I'm on the TV guys.

[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.360]
Probably Mike Thompson and maybe Lee Thawler

[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.520]
would come back for that one too.

[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.160]
Is that it?

[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:48.460]
That's it.

[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.700]
Well listen, you gave us some, certainly some stuff

[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.300]
to think about.

[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.360]
There's no question about that.

[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:52.940]
OK.

[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:53.660]
Have a great day.

[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.080]
You too.

[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:54.520]
OK.

[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:55.980]
What a nice guy, huh?

[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:56.700]
It was great.

[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.360]
So hanging out, he's skipping school today.

[00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.340]
Hope he has a good day.

[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.280]
We don't want to encourage young people to skip school,

[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.560]
but if they happen to be in a mood,

[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.800]
and they want to stay home, go ahead.

[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:04.880]
You know, you only live once.

[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.120]
Have a good time.

[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.760]
26 till 8 on, say to four.

[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.000]
Accidents.

[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:09.860]
Oh, gee.

[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:10.520]
That one on.
