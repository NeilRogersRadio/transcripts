[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340]
Okay, can you believe this that we're actually over here? It seems like only yesterday.

[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.300]
We were depressed and morbid and suicidal and here we are in this beautiful

[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.520]
collatial studio and everybody is so friendly and nice. It's weird, isn't it?

[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.160]
Weird and it's incredible. Anyway, good morning to 10.05 at 6.10.00 W.I.O.D.

[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.240]
and this is our inaugural our debut and which is always an exciting event. Let me just

[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.340]
make sure I got everything technically straightened out because you know we come from a very

[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.780]
up front and uptight technical situation at the other place. Which we'll be talking about at

[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.220]
length anyway. I just want them to get ready and get the machines rolling. I want to know what

[00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.680]
Renerie was talking about this morning. The mystery picker. Did you hear him talking about that

[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.060]
all morning long? The mystery picker and I thought Mike just in a couple of days we haven't

[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.180]
even officially started yet and we've influenced that man. Okay, now we got a mobile collar. Look at

[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.320]
that phone go nuts here. We haven't given the numbers out. We want to thank Jane from eats and

[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.980]
treats and then over tons of food. We haven't opened it yet because we know that there's a big

[00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.560]
this is going to be our first and hopefully our only real controversy with the management here

[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.320]
is about the food in the studio because the engineers and the management are really uptight

[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.540]
about this beautiful, polatial new studio and I can understand that. I can relate to what do they

[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.120]
think we're going to do. We're going to turn this into a luncheon. We can be real neat. Trust me if

[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.740]
they've heard before they know that we can eat more and leave no trace. Oh yeah, we're okay. We're

[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.480]
all hands at this and the Johnny Jesus brand pizza at 11.00. So I don't know what we're going to do

[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.000]
with that but we're going to have to confront the food in the studio issue real quick. Okay,

[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.500]
we got this mobile on one. Let's see if I can do this right. Okay. Hello. Yes sir. I'm the inaugural

[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.980]
caller. Yes sir. You're number one sir. I can't buy. I do that. I'm so impressed with myself. You

[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.680]
want to be sir. Are you honored? I've only talked to you once before. You want to go home and write

[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.040]
this in your diary. Okay. I tell you this is like the most impressive moment of your life. So where

[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.900]
are you right now? You're in your car. I'm actually driving US one on my way to downtown Miami

[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.520]
with a 45 minutes away that clearance that was only going to be 50. Well, you know clearance.

[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.320]
He's had a rough case. Now you're the sports voice of of South Florida. You're on the sports

[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.940]
voice. That is correct. Now you're not going to start with sports, tell you sir. We just

[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.720]
got to start with sports stock for an hour there. You're not going to do sports.

[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:25.420]
I'm not going to get into anything that's really that controversial. Yeah. But you're a

[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.440]
powerful. Just have known you on one sports. You used to be a pilot fan. That's correct.

[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.160]
But not but not for like five minutes for 30 years. Okay. Okay. Time out 40. You're talking to

[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.980]
then. Yeah. I'm going to say what's going to be talking about. I'm saying no. I didn't switch to

[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.600]
the meds. What kind of a call is this to start? No. I'm a Cubs fan and a butt man. Okay.

[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.120]
Right. Fine. I just want to congratulate you. You want to turn immediately from a good

[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.460]
caller into a dude fast. Don't you want to do? I like that. I got you. I got you going early.

[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.820]
Yeah. You really do. You got my adrenaline going here. Oh, good. I didn't have a wonderful life.

[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.100]
I got a lot of important calls here. I understand that. But I wanted to congratulate you.

[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.880]
And I wanted to be your Niagara caller. And remember me that gunner. Okay, sir. It's a pleasure

[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.220]
to talk to you. Lots of lots. And I hope you have a lot of fun on this station. Okay. Have a

[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.960]
wonderful life. Okay. Those phones are going up. So we've even got Stem on my mobile phone. Hello.

[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.460]
Hi. This is Paul. I'm going to call it. It's Stem on O on eight. Oh, Stem is on eight. This is who?

[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.200]
This is Hollywood. Well, as long as there's a voice there, that's all I care about. How you doing?

[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.300]
It's great. It's great to hear your voice again. It's a bit exciting. It takes me back almost two

[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.480]
years, but a year and a half to when we're on AM on a real in, you know, in a real part of the day

[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.180]
when people are awake and alive. And we get all these mobile callers and the people under the age

[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.220]
of a hundred. It's frightening. Isn't it, sir? I'm real happy for you. Neil, that you don't have to sell your house.

[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.140]
Exactly. Are you going to try to get a standard job there? No.

[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.640]
Well, I never thought I'd hear you on AM again. I'm really glad to hear you.

[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.420]
Okay. Well, have a wonderful day, sir. And thanks for your very perspicacious call.

[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.040]
Now, what is this Stem is on my mobile phone? The reason I want to get this quick is because I'm

[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.940]
paying for the car. Hello. There he is on my car phone. Yeah. What's going on?

[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.500]
Nothing much. It's driving to work. Well, congratulations. It's about time.

[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.460]
And it's why I said it's about time. It's something constructive with your life. Of course. Welcome to AM.

[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.620]
Thank you so much. So I'm going to bring out the old stuff now or what?

[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.360]
We got some real good stuff coming up. In fact, we have some shockers coming later in the hour.

[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.860]
So get your real to real going and whatever else. Okay. All right. Make sure

[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.500]
somebody's listening. Okay. Get off my phone now. Will you please? All right. I'll go now.

[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.700]
Bye. I think they thought I'm short that call was exactly because I was paying for it.

[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.440]
Okay. Just want to make sure I'm doing all these things right. This is pretty simple. You know what?

[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.780]
It really is. I got a volume on the phone. Say a little bit. Got everything here. Well,

[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.320]
no, he's controlling him in there. Why are you having trouble hearing him? Oh,

[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.040]
a little. Well, wait a minute. See, I can crank the monitor level up here. And the overhead,

[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.760]
you'll be able to hear him better. Right? It's a little, uh, any other complaints? That's it.

[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.260]
So far. Okay. All right. Now we're going to do break at 10. Boy, this is exciting. You know,

[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.200]
because everything is on the screen. This is almost like a real professional radio station,

[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.740]
instead of like having the log, you know, falling on the floor and in between the layers of pizza.

[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.160]
Well, it used to happen. It's like you'd get all those layers of mong on the log and you couldn't

[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.980]
read it anymore. You didn't know what spot was coming up. It was kind of exciting. Separate phone,

[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.260]
volume control. You mean like in here? Yeah. Yeah. I think that's what you. Okay. You can.

[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.860]
Well, we work on this. Yeah. This is the first day. First hour. We're going to do a break now.

[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.800]
Is this our first inaugural break on the new Roger show and W IOD? Okay. It's 10 10 on 610 W IOD. All right.

[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.640]
Okay. It's 10 14. And I'm going to play something here. But I got a caution. You're going to have

[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.860]
a better dub of this tomorrow or the next day. Yeah. This is a horrendous. The quality is not what

[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.740]
you'd call real exciting. But this is a. Oh, yeah.

[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.420]
Yeah.

[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.960]
Well, I was driving down 95 the other night. Somebody nearly cut me right off the road.

[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.860]
I decided wasn't going to do any good to get mad. So I wrote a song about him instead.

[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.640]
It goes like this.

[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:40.160]
Or did you work in your whole life? Either way, it worked out fine.

[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.980]
Because you're an asshole tonight.

[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:54.680]
Yes, you're an A. That's that's so early. And don't you try to blame it on me?

[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.800]
You need to serve all the credit. You're an asshole tonight.

[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:13.360]
We're an asshole yesterday. You're an asshole tonight.

[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:22.080]
I've got a feeling you'll be an asshole the rest of your life.

[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.060]
I was talking to your mother.

[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.020]
Yes, the other night.

[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:16.400]
I told her I passed you an asshole. She said yes. I think you're right.

[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:26.940]
And all your friends are assholes. Because you know that your whole life.

[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:35.400]
Somebody told me you've got an asshole for life.

[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:45.920]
Were you born an asshole? Or did you work in your whole life?

[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.360]
Either way, it worked out fine.

[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:58.360]
Because you're an asshole tonight.

[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.380]
Okay, so it was a little off speed. It was a little bit slow and a little bit muffled. But

[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:10.200]
it takes us back to those wonderful glory days. And then do something for you?

[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.460]
The glory day. Okay, it's 10, 17 on 6, 10, WI-O-D, the near Roger Show. And of course,

[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.720]
Uncle Steve will be along this afternoon. Another one of Steve's contrived debates.

[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.980]
And he's going to have a bunch of blacks in here being each other's brains out.

[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.080]
Right? And have a blacks for Ducakis. And he went out and they conducted a very,

[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.200]
very lengthy search in blacks for Bush, which is really going to be exciting.

[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:34.700]
So they said that Bush is going to get about 15% of the black vote, which I think shows you how

[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.600]
incompetent the Ducakis campaign is. I mean, that's almost impossible.

[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.000]
Okay, now one thing that I have a bad habit of doing, I take these mobile callers ahead and

[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.920]
always pay for it. Hello. Hello. Yes, are you mobile? No, I'm not. Oh, I'm under a,

[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.280]
oh, that's, uh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I want to be your first gal. That was on one.

[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:57.460]
Now, am I under wrong? That's your mistake? My mistake. Oh, you told him that you were mobile, huh?

[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.280]
I don't know. No, I did not. I bought, yeah, okay. No, I didn't.

[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.440]
In other words, you just told little 50 get on right away, right?

[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.620]
Okay, go ahead. I know I understand. I just want to be your first lady.

[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.260]
Yeah, okay. Okay. You would be too. Trust me.

[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.960]
In more ways than one. That is correct.

[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.560]
Yeah, right. Can you turn that up louder in here?

[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.080]
In here a little bit. Okay. Now, wait a minute. Is that better? Talk.

[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.140]
Okay. Is that better?

[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.820]
Lots of luck. Now, wait a minute. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. Oh, wait a minute.

[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.760]
The telephone level there. Okay, go ahead. All right.

[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.680]
Oh, okay. Get your buttons working.

[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.080]
Okay. You just mind your own buttons. Okay. I'll take care of my buttons and you

[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.000]
worry about yours. Okay.

[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.380]
So what's going on? First of all, happy birthday.

[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.120]
Thank you. It was a lot of fun. We had a very quiet day and I want to thank Ray Nappett,

[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.220]
Rick oven pizza for throwing a little party for us. It was great. Great, great, great.

[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.340]
Loads of luck where you are right now. Now I can sleep an hour later in the morning.

[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.300]
Yeah, you know, that getting up at 4.30 in the morning. That was hell.

[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.260]
I used to get up at 6. Just to listen to you.

[00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:01.940]
Yeah, it was hell. That's right. But listen, I'm the lady to go ahead.

[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:07.040]
Wait a minute. I'm the gal that called you. Did you do anything about electrocuting your

[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.120]
termites? Yes. So it didn't have any termites. It turned out it was just like the wood.

[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.740]
It's a whole long story and I don't want to put the audience in a coma.

[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.600]
No, okay. We'll let Mike talk about it tomorrow.

[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.660]
Yeah. Yeah. I heard that.

[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.760]
Along with the mystery picker. I want to know what that means.

[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.000]
Yeah. I have no idea. The mystery picker.

[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.800]
Boy, they had to bring in a crane to get that finger out of his nose here.

[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:26.560]
That it was disgusting.

[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.700]
Listen, play that music.

[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.740]
Yeah, we're going to do a lot of good stuff here today.

[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.760]
Didn't that bring back memories? What we just, uh, of course, I bet it did.

[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:34.980]

[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.680]
We're ways than one dude.

[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.340]
You got it. Well, listen, have a wonderful day.

[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.640]
Our first lady, car and don't ever lie to my producer again.

[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.760]
I didn't say anything. It's just a joke. Relax.

[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.000]
Yeah. Okay. Have a nice one. Bye-bye.

[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.720]
We got another break to do now. This is good.

[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.840]
You realize something we haven't done anything yet?

[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:52.900]
No, not a thing.

[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.580]
And on his first day, Steve was right.

[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.760]
There's like a honeymoon period.

[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.240]
Yeah. And everybody, oh, you're so wonderful.

[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.000]
Oh, yeah. All the butt liquors will be calling in.

[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.940]
Now, one thing we don't want anybody over a hundred.

[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.700]
Okay, we got to get rid of some of these old farts.

[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.720]
It called WIOD.

[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.960]
We don't want them on this show.

[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.600]
We want them to listen and sit back and relax.

[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.700]
But we don't want to hear their voices because it's bad.

[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.680]
It's bad for the sales department.

[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.860]
It sounds like bad demographics.

[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.220]
We want those young pinheads to come back.

[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:16.560]
Don't we?

[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.240]
Except for the struggling lady.

[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.740]
Oh, yeah. We can call any time.

[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.080]
Yeah. Okay. Now, let me give the numbers.

[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.520]
All of the phones are going nuts here.

[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:22.920]
Budget.

[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.560]
It would be nice if I gave the numbers.

[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:30.000]
They county 751 WIOD for Lauderdale and Broward 524 WIOD.

[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.900]
I feel like sandy now.

[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.280]
All these numbers, man.

[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.800]
I used to listen to her give those numbers.

[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.280]
Which is also good because that takes like a whole break.

[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.860]
Bokeh and Delray 278 WIOD and in the Palm Beach is 655 WIOD.

[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.480]
It's 1021 on 610 WIOD.

[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:49.240]
And this is the most disgusting program.

[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.760]
I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.480]
Okay, and they will.

[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.800]
I'm sure that 1025 on 610 WIOD, then you'll round your show.

[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.300]
That brought a tear to my eye.

[00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.420]
That Steve Cain thing.

[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.020]
It really did.

[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.260]
Wasn't that a lot of BS?

[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.620]
Most of it is, you know, when you're full of it, it comes out of your face.

[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.040]
It does.

[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.140]
It knows that's the way we feel.

[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.780]
Okay, let's say now you're sure this is a mobile, right?

[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.700]
Okay, positive.

[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:09.000]
Hello.

[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.280]
Hey, listen, I want to congratulate all of you.

[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.200]
There is he.

[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.180]
Absolutely my grandson.

[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.060]
Oh, and I want to tell him happy birthday.

[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.500]
Boy, you got the quietest engine in your car that I've ever heard in my life, you know what?

[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.120]
Really?

[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:24.540]
Yeah.

[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.920]
Can you blow your horn for us?

[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:26.940]
It's to your horn one time.

[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:27.520]
Come on.

[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:28.900]
Well, let me see.

[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:29.740]
Give us a little tooth.

[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:30.940]
A tooth tooth.

[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:31.520]
There you go.

[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:32.940]
Yeah, I left it.

[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:34.920]
Boy, I can't believe it.

[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.420]
Well, listen, have a wonderful day and don't ever call a show again, okay?

[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.460]
Well, they are really giving you a line of BS today, aren't they?

[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.380]
They're really giving a deal.

[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.100]
So don't ever say for sure.

[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.380]
Say so they say or something like that.

[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.480]
Miami, hello.

[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.320]
I do a nail.

[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:47.840]
Pretty good.

[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:48.760]
Boy, listen to these phones.

[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.840]
This is great, isn't it?

[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.600]
It is actually.

[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.540]
It sound like you're in the same county almost.

[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.480]
You're the same planet.

[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:54.360]
No, I'm from Miami.

[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.280]
Great.

[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.680]
It's great hearing your voice again.

[00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.160]
I saw myself calling 976 Niel just to hear your voice.

[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.060]
Well, thank God for them.

[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.660]
Maybe I should have stayed off another couple of weeks.

[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.540]
Could have picked up the most serious chain.

[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.200]
Just great.

[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.300]
Yeah, we're glad to be here.

[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.120]
That wasn't bad.

[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:07.940]
And that was pretty good.

[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.120]
Yeah, that was embellished.

[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:09.680]
Yeah.

[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.200]
When I called the police, we used to work.

[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.680]
Yeah, I was awake and I was woken up and I called the station.

[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.200]
And I listened to Dave and the Ford.

[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.100]
And I said, what happened?

[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.760]
And he said, oh, well, they were driving the work.

[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.720]
And the spaceship took them off.

[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.880]
I just really didn't know what happened.

[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:27.540]
The spaceship?

[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:28.240]
Yeah.

[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:30.260]
Spaceship.

[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.380]
I like that.

[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.640]
I have nothing to say.

[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.280]
I understand about that particular show.

[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:37.140]
Oh, really?

[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.640]
But I'm glad to hear you.

[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.660]
And lots of luck.

[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.700]
I'd have to stay by the way.

[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:42.380]
Thank you very much.

[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.840]
You're a great American and we appreciate it.

[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.200]
Thank you.

[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:44.800]
Bye bye.

[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.540]
Now the bird, I want to think, wait a minute.

[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:47.760]
I want to think I'm confused about.

[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.600]
Yeah, so I got to get figure out where I am.

[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.440]
OK, at all times.

[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.720]
No, seriously, because then when you punch the off,

[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.980]
but it's kind of stupid if you punch the wrong bank.

[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.380]
And then like you hear that click,

[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.520]
like he hung up there and it sounds like real bush league.

[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.720]
Before we used to that, 1027 on WIOD.

[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.300]
And Johnny Jesus bringing that pizza.

[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.340]
Now they're going to get upset when the food comes in here.

[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.520]
Because I didn't expect on the first day,

[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.060]
I really didn't that we'd have this confrontation.

[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.860]
I thought that would take at least a few days.

[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.580]
And then we do it our way, OK?

[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.880]
But when I'm telling you, by the time we leave here,

[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:18.960]
there won't be a scratch.

[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:19.760]
Trust me.

[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.900]
They will never know that there was any food in here.

[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:22.420]
Believe me.

[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.320]
Sharon's worried.

[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.520]
Jesus, if he's going to gain all this weight with us here.

[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.320]
And he looks a little bit emaciated.

[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.640]
She could put on a couple of pounds.

[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.540]
No, seriously, you could put on a couple of pounds.

[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.720]
Nobody would ever know the difference.

[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.840]
Now I do want to say this, OK?

[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:34.740]
Because we have a lot of,

[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.600]
see, there's so much insanity going on here.

[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.340]
Because we've got all the phones ringing like crazy.

[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.400]
It's that honeymoon period.

[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.160]
You know, a couple of weeks will be back in for calls.

[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.220]
And then everybody is so enthusiastic in the building.

[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.480]
And the food is coming in.

[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.640]
And it's one of those things that happens on your first day back

[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.700]
after that long rest.

[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.480]
What were we off for three days?

[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.040]
Five.

[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.180]
No, no, but I mean three.

[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.200]
Oh, yeah, three work days.

[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:56.860]
What a nice.

[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.020]
It was real nice.

[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:58.760]
It was a great time.

[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.200]
Although it seems to me that I was here a couple of days.

[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:01.680]
Wasn't I?

[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.680]
You were here Friday.

[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.500]
And I want to thank Steve, by the way.

[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.800]
Steve was very cordial and friendly.

[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.840]
We'll see how long that lasts.

[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.180]
But now he was.

[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:08.720]
He was great.

[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:09.040]

[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.920]
And we'll whip him into shape.

[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.220]
We'll get rid of the baseball card stuff

[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.540]
and all that boring crap that he's

[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.380]
going to have it a doing.

[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:15.940]
Are we?

[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.100]
And we'll force him to do a real show every day.

[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:18.480]
Wow.

[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:18.840]
Right?

[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.240]
I mean, we're not doing one today.

[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.460]
This is like, this requires no effort whatsoever.

[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.600]
But we'll whip him into shape.

[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.700]
And force him to be at his best, which is when he's dangerous.

[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.260]
But the thing that astonishes me is that there

[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.280]
are people at the place where we used to work.

[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.180]
Can we mention Zeta?

[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.940]
See, I have to ask everything.

[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.440]
Because one thing about Bill Wise here

[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.200]
is our operations manager, no matter what I say to him.

[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.580]
And I clear everything with him.

[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:41.880]
OK.

[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:42.500]
Everything.

[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.640]
I say, you know, is it OK if we do this or play it?

[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:45.560]
Of course.

[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.800]
What's wrong with that?

[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.660]
That's what he always says every time he says that.

[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:50.060]
Exactly.

[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.100]
I mean, like when we played the George Carlin record

[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.580]
in the next hour, he's not going to have any problem with that.

[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.920]
Just a joke, Bill, relax.

[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.660]
You can say Zeta for.

[00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.960]
OK, so we can say Zeta for.

[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:00.940]
And we used to be there.

[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.680]
And we were there for a year.

[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.520]
And a lot of people are wondering,

[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.560]
why would they take the number?

[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.800]
Well, they didn't do anything.

[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.620]
Because I went to them and I said,

[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.980]
by, like Chef Crowley on it, have you ever seen Chef Crowley

[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.020]
who peddled the kitchen stuff on TV?

[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.600]
And he goes, bye, bye, like that.

[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.660]
And I gave him a little like that.

[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.820]
And they said, boy, your wrist is a lot limper today

[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:17.640]
than it was a year ago.

[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.460]
And I said, that's from working for you people, OK?

[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.060]
Because you've intimidated.

[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.060]
You've harassed.

[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:22.720]
You've hassled.

[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.980]
You've done everything it was to make us miserable as a reward

[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.240]
for getting you these great numbers.

[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:27.700]
Yeah.

[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.580]
And what they tried to tell us, and I

[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.900]
know people are not going to believe this.

[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.060]
And we won't mention Tim's name because he's defensive.

[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.820]
He just want to be hassled.

[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.160]
So we'll just say upper level management over there.

[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:37.720]
Fine.

[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.700]
Was brain dead.

[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.460]
OK, is that a nice way to put it in that?

[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.640]
And it came to me and they said,

[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.460]
well, you know, it's nice that you're number one.

[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.280]
But we would rather have you be number three.

[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.720]
And I said, I don't know how to be number three.

[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.140]
How do you be number three?

[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:50.680]
OK.

[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.760]
And they said as far as creativity is concerned, forget it.

[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.520]
Yeah, we don't want any.

[00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:57.740]
We just don't want it.

[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.020]
We just want a nice safe show.

[00:17:59.080 --> 00:17:59.840]
And that's what they've got.

[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.340]
OK, when you're doing ones, it's nice.

[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.300]
And it's safe.

[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.920]
And if taking an AM and they've gone back to that all news

[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.820]
format, which was a terminal loser about three years ago,

[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:10.160]
remember?

[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.240]
That's why they changed it.

[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.340]
And they blew out Stan and Jay and everything else.

[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.540]
They're all of the talk virtually.

[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.380]
And they put the all news back, which

[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.740]
has the oldest demographic of any format in the country.

[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.760]
Number one, and number two, it's failed here.

[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.820]
Yeah, but it was very successful years ago.

[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.080]
And then it just it ran out again.

[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.800]
But you know, Mark, if you got admit, they got that tree doctor.

[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.960]
The tree doctor's tough.

[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:30.380]
You're right.

[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.600]
In fact, if Ernie is listening this morning,

[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.640]
you'd be up against that tree surgeon.

[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.360]
Oh, I'm going to tell you he's not an olim.

[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.400]
And believe me, trust me, that whole place is out on the limb.

[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.100]
So no, but the amazing thing.

[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.760]
And you're going to be surprised to hear me say this,

[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.120]
because I know you're a venomous person.

[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.740]
But no, seriously, I don't have any hostile feelings.

[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.960]
It's like I'm so relieved to be out of there.

[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.720]
And away from those doodle birds that I just don't, I'm numb.

[00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:58.500]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.360]
I thought after we left, I thought,

[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.100]
I was going to be just come on here and attack them and rip and tear and go crazy.

[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.240]
And I just don't have the feeling to do it because I'm just, I, I just am numb.

[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.660]
I guess that's the best way to put it.

[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:10.820]
I'm almost at a loss for words.

[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.700]
Well, do you remember what I said to you when I left?

[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.900]
I said the last day we were, I said, there's absolutely no need to wish them

[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.820]
anything bad.

[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.580]
Well, we don't have to do it because you're going to take care of it.

[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.740]
They'll all take care of it.

[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:22.660]
Yeah, they're going to do a real good job.

[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.800]
We wish them all the best.

[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:24.420]
We do.

[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.200]
Well, we don't wish them anything bad.

[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.800]
I wish they'd all the best because they did a great job with us.

[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.780]
And he's a good guy and we still consider him a friend and all of that, although,

[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.180]
but anyway, he is.

[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.820]
He's a great guy and he did a lot of creative stuff for us.

[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.180]
And I wish him the best, but again, they haven't told him much either from what he tells me.

[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:40.540]
Really?

[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.520]
I don't want to put him in a precarious position, but they're just like kind of playing

[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.760]
at fast and loose like maybe you'll be on and maybe you won't and we're conducting a nationwide search.

[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.420]
Those nationwide searches that they conduct over there, man, they produce some of the most

[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.040]
incredible talent in the history like that.

[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:55.640]
Morning Zoo.

[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:56.760]
Do you remember that?

[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:57.680]
I remember that.

[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.300]
I remember, when he saw such a bunch of bird brains, is that?

[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.140]
I think they're still playing off.

[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.200]
That's kind of incredible.

[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.100]
So anyway, we're not going to mention the name of the upper level.

[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.860]
You know, it's amazing that they've got the gall, the hootspot, to be calling here and

[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.920]
telling us not to talk about man.

[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.780]
It's like they think we're still working there.

[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:15.220]
Yeah.

[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.620]
Have you ever heard anything like that in your life?

[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.100]
Well, they're trying, I guess, but they still try to intimidate us and to hassle us and

[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.000]
give us a rough time and they can go to hell, okay?

[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:31.100]
They can go to hell is what they can do as far as I'm concerned because they treated us like crap, like garbage.

[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:36.360]
Like some human mung is how they treated us and they just couldn't handle the success.

[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:40.520]
Remember back on AM, I slogan to describe their philosophy, mess with success?

[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.460]
Well, some people can't.

[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.800]
They can never handle the successful day parts.

[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.080]
They've always got a medal with them and the other parts where they're doing ones, I don't want to

[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.380]
mention any specific individuals over there, but the parts of the day where they're doing

[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:56.540]
like ones in a 1.2, which is like not even being on the air almost, hey, they love those people

[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:59.840]
because they don't make any waves and they don't say anything and there's no controversy.

[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:00.220]
Right.

[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.260]
And that's what it's all about.

[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.500]
I still wonder what that mystery picker was all about.

[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:08.700]
I even wrote that down, which I rarely write any little notes or anything, but the mystery

[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.100]
picker when Rene rekept saying that over and over and I thought, boy, we've really got

[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.200]
him nailed into a corner, no?

[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:13.980]
This is good.

[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.060]
Now, if Rich Pact is listening and this is a little inside thing, he is, by the way.

[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:33.340]
He's the guy who's got a positive that he's going to have that stuff.

[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.740]
Or he'll know where we can get it.

[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:35.720]
And he is listening.

[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.580]
I just, if he doesn't come up with the next couple of days, we're going to rip the crap

[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.020]
out of it.

[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:39.960]
All right.

[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.200]
Let me take a quick corner because I'm sitting here rambling and we ought to go to homestead.

[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:43.480]
Hello.

[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.020]
How you doing, bud?

[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:45.940]
How you doing, bud?

[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:46.840]
How you doing, bud?

[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:47.800]
How you doing, bud?

[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.040]
How you doing, bud?

[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.040]

[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.040]

[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.040]

[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.040]

[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.040]

[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.040]

[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.040]

[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.040]

[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.040]

[00:21:48.040 --> 00:22:18.020]
I'm just going to go ahead and get you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:48.000]
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:47.640]
of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:17.580]
bit of a little bit of the main thing I want to show you of course what we will tell you about this and to this. This is what what we will tell you to do is warm up the flavours from within, you know. Right, so things have such a little bit of you know.

[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:22.420]
so unfortunate you have no idea and they said well we'll see you okay now

[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:27.140]
and listen you don't have to say anything but anyone because you have a talent

[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:32.440]
and you have intelligence to educate people they can you have been doing for

[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.760]
last eight years I sure have and I feel that you don't have to

[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:41.860]
stick down to that level because they lost what they had the best that is correct

[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:47.060]
myself I like thank you for all the help that you have given us the last eight

[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:52.920]
years and I also like the time you're playing the game song yeah if you're

[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.520]
fit in this town doesn't it yeah you like and if you have any idea then does

[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.200]
they start to stop you from doing that then he's doing something wrong because

[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.180]
you know doing anything illegal he doesn't want to listen to that he can turn

[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.860]
his radio off well that's true of anybody anybody doesn't want like what we're

[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.500]
doing it doesn't want to listen they can go whistle in a dark place okay have a

[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:16.860]
wonderful day and moving right along to see now I'm torn because I see Veggie is

[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:20.200]
on there in Boka and we haven't taken to Boka but I'm gonna take him out of

[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.580]
order because I'm so excited to see his name on the screen Veggie hey how you doing

[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:29.540]
the off pretty good what's up pal I'm just just be loaded I just can't believe it

[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.720]
there yeah I can't either you know that's a real radio station and the people

[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:37.140]
here have been really nice to us and we'll see how long that lasts okay yeah we'll

[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.720]
have you that you switched because number one I don't have to deal with the

[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.820]
operators for collect calls here right yeah we got a Boka line we got a Palm Beach

[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:52.980]
line like a real radio station okay unbelievable unbelievable is right I just I

[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:58.720]
just realized that just beginning to sink in you know I can catch your whole show now

[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.380]
I don't have to only catch your last half yeah my audience you know we did real good

[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.740]
numbers in the morning we had great demographics although they were the wrong ones of

[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:11.120]
course but the morning drive was just not our crowd okay they weren't awake yet and

[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.220]
they just couldn't call it was fun but uh... tourley that's right and plus you know I

[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:20.120]
just noticed you don't even have to deal with the way anymore really what do you mean by that

[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:25.480]
I don't think you have a developer yes oh yeah we do wrong trust me Veggie it's right

[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:30.360]
there it's flashing in fact as soon as we punched you up I started glowing a little

[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.720]
for rest of you know what I'm saying now it's going on now it's going like blink

[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:40.220]

[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.720]

[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.400]
day

[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:21.680]
yeah you too you know bye bye now it's a great guy really is in fact it was amazing like

[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.700]
old home week when we walked in here last two days that press conference because I look

[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:29.320]
around here all these people that I've worked with over the years in fact it looked like

[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:34.040]
we're just coming back to a people who escaped from a concentration camp or something

[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.500]
well I just said that to get Ernie's a title I know it was so weird because I was walking

[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.580]
down the hall Tuesday and they came up to me and they said Glenn this is Rick Weaver and

[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:49.800]
I went wow mr. Weaver to you okay weaver mr. and after yesterday's game I would stay

[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.260]
away from perfuting good idea yeah they just can't do anything in New England you know

[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.960]
there must be something about the air up there of the atmosphere they just stink up there

[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.300]
oh I can't say that can't they really do they're pathetic when they play up there but that's

[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:07.800]
way it goes okay ten forty four W I O D and one thing that I must say I'm proud of it doesn't

[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:14.380]
mean a lot but when I leave a station even when we went from AM to FM I don't have any problem

[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.880]
given the right call iters that's right I don't know why that is I never made a mistake and I

[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:25.200]
remember one night this is a true story one night I was a W snooze years ago and I said it's a

[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:30.720]
ten twenty five W BTA and I don't know where that came from from the Tavya New York where I worked

[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:38.220]
like twenty five years ago and I said W BTA and it just slipped out it poured it out that's weird

[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:42.320]
you sure you didn't dream that well I probably was thinking about the Tavya downs or something like that

[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.600]
okay now we got a lot of stuff that we have to play today because it is the first day and I want

[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.880]
you to understand that there a whole group of people it's like work oh yeah oh yeah

[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.820]
yesterday today okay there a whole group of people out there not Neo Rogers listeners and I

[00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:00.420]
heard those people calling Steve last week who allegedly never listen to my show have no idea who I

[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:05.100]

[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.140]
coconut am I doing this wrong because I have a feeling I have a feeling that I keep going to line

[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:29.640]
one over and over and over again I just I don't know why we did bokeh for the first time I took

[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:35.240]

resistance worn down here you won't have to worry about bringing food in okay I can still bring it in

[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:09.960]
absolutely that's good I just found the old building and you change things on me like the next day

[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:15.880]
that is correct where is this place where are we yeah where are you you're in Cooper City yeah

[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.000]
well that's not far from you know we're in the 79th Street Causeway in North Bay village

[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:26.260]
now you know where that is are you familiar with Miami right next to Channel 7 oh I'm

[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.940]
you know in fact all the former employees of Channel 7 were lined up out there picketing

[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:34.900]
this morning when I came to work it was exciting just a joke don't get up tied over there at

[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.820]
Channel 7 Bob Soap or won't even come over here and do the weather and I get to meet Bob Soap

[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:44.380]
or by way so he'll probably be in here any minute this is great no he won't come back on the phone

[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:49.340]
oh he does all of those on the phone are you okay that hangs out with her now and it's a good

[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.300]
line because it sounds like he's right here in the building when he comes in and he says

[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:56.080]
he might get your finger out of there I'm sure that he's sitting right there looking at him you

[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.380]
gotta be kidding me so what do you think Pat what is your first name by the way so we have like a

[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:05.820]
handle on you Marshall Marshall yeah we don't usually do names on a show but in your case we'll make

[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:10.240]
an exception okay I feel honored you do you should be honored okay well listen to Marshall have a

[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.220]
wonderful day okay and we'll be looking for that breakfast or get nothing that not like McDonald's

[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:19.300]
or anything okay no I'm reading some homecook stuff all right okay fine that's fun's cake okay

[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:24.360]
well let the reneary tasted first see how it is okay okay thanks a lot bye bye well that was

[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:28.880]
incredible wasn't it hmm see my problem is I'm not reading any of the stuff you're typing on the

[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:36.140]
that's a problem well I'm kind of independent you know what they say we just do our own thing

[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:43.180]
into hell with everybody else I am so tempted to play that that 2D fruity Alice wow but I don't

[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:46.760]
they'll back us up it's two and a half minutes long yeah and on the first day I want to make sure we

[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.660]
hit the brakes on time and we're so they get a false sense of security like we're gonna do things

[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:55.560]
on time well I'd like it closer to two o'clock we will do the top of the hour news on time we will do

[00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:01.320]
that yeah but other than that can you believe that let me do the news here it is shocking I'll tell you

[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.580]
that it is shocking because you did said kind of a new trend for news in the market effect I heard

[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:10.580]
you said this morning talking over music fumbling through the news I don't imagine any maybe

[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:16.000]
was shocking yeah well the original is always the best and I do want to say this because man man is

[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.180]
so defensive Peter Bulger better known as Rose is a great guy he thinks I'm gonna rip him over here

[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:26.060]
and not I have no reason to rip him his taste in music is suspect but other than that he's a good

[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:31.500]
guy we got along is great 90% of the time and he treated me very fairly and he and I kind of had it

[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.500]
all worked out that we were gonna leave in a nice way and then of course others we don't want to

[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:39.780]
mention any names kind of let the cattle to the bag and it became you know imminent that we just

[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:44.380]
had to get the hell out of there yeah to protect all concerned but I have not I have no bad feelings

[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:49.780]
about him and he's so damn defensive I told him that now his music that's another story and at

[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:54.480]
the so-called classic croc that they play over there that's well can I say it's about a one three

[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:59.240]
whether we're there whether we're not there one three one five somewhere in there and you just

[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:05.060]
can't win with with a one three no oh wants to talk to the pig let's get that call on right away hello

[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:15.560]
hello yes is it real yes I can't believe the way you abuse people I know it's terrible isn't it

[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:21.820]
it certainly is I do think that you're at a decent station as you say you're calling this is

[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:26.500]
decent station the first day you went to INZ you said the same thing about them they were a

[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:31.140]
decent station the first day I went there that's correct but you don't have a decent thing to say

[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:38.600]
about anybody which of course leads us to ask the one logical question you know what the question is

[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:44.880]
have many ideas why I think of one it seems it seems to me since you listened to INZ even though

[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:50.560]
briefly obviously right and you probably listened on Zeta all the probably you never listen on Zeta

[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:54.740]
and now you're listening here today you know what I do I wait a minute wait a minute don't

[00:34:54.740 --> 00:35:00.560]
get hyper I would add it to them to hear out that you were gone oh I say that you were on here so

[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.820]
in other words instead of uh what an attorney the dial once you had the radio accident you felt

[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:10.660]
compelled to call and chew me out is that it well really I wanted to speak to someone at

[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:15.780]
who has charge of the off oh so in other words you didn't want to speak to me right good okay

[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:22.320]
who the hell is he killed right she's going to be out there everyday getting sexual

[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:27.740]
excitement from the side of my voice lady you're not fooling anybody okay and we don't really want to

[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:33.160]
talk to old bags like you anyhow and I think you should turn your radio down a little bit I think you

[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:39.520]
made disturb your neighbors yeah she's got it up so loud while she's getting those good vibrations okay

[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:45.700]
even Brian Wilson never talk to vibrations like those okay we're going to take our break on time

[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:50.600]
because we want to be really on our best behavior on the first day yeah this forget it anytime we feel

[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:57.500]
like it it's 10 51 on 6 10 W I O D it's a good time for the great taste

[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:04.660]
Neil this is noodles reminding you that it's always a good time for the great taste yeah I thought

[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:08.800]
it would be good to get some of her old friends voices back on here now did the laugh make it over

[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:15.000]

[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.360]

Okay, that's an offer.

[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:59.360]
Anyway, the last sentence says if we all pull together on this, we can severely damage

[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.720]
WIOD's recent moves.

[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.820]
Better yet, let's just shut down the transmitter.

[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:05.940]
What a comedian at John Harper, isn't he?

[00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:07.000]

That's wonderful.

[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.900]
That's the funniest thing I've read in a long time, John.

[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.980]
We don't know who's your last paycheck at Zeta.

[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:17.620]

Good listener from the Grove.

[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:38.400]
Jeez, I've been on here since I just heard the most horrific news from Henry at 10-30 this morning

[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.060]
when he came on with a sound bite for the lead-on for the news.

[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.680]
What was that about the bodies on the causeway?

[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:49.680]
He said two bullet bodies were found alongside the Julia's shuttle causeway.

[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:51.240]
Yeah, the J.S.

[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:54.740]
He said Mike DeCarcus and George Bush.

[00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:57.860]
Yeah, and the reporters are excited.

[00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:59.560]
I turned to a wrong station.

[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:04.340]
I'm going to have a serious program here today, huh?

[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:05.660]
Yeah, real heavy.

[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.060]
Real heavy.

[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.040]
I'm going to skip work and stay with you.

[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.480]
Okay, good for you to want to do.

[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:10.820]
Good.

[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.280]
Yeah, we're going to get into the bodies on the causeway.

[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.680]
We're going to talk about all the real heavy stuff.

[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.520]
I'll take this literally from Henry.

[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:17.560]
Okay.

[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.640]
It was George Bush and Mike DeCarcus, right?

[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:20.640]
That's what you just said.

[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.140]
That's perfect.

[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:22.480]
Okay, good luck to you.

[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:23.660]
I hope you vote early and often.

[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.340]
Okay, boy.

[00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:28.000]
He was okay, but he just the first time was good.

[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:28.380]
Yeah.

[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.480]
Well, at least he's got his priorities straight.

[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.340]
He's going to miss work to listen to the show.

[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:33.820]
Okay, let's go to a Fort Lauderdale.

[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:34.100]
Hello.

[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:35.740]
Hello.

[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:36.500]
Hi.

[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:38.700]
Are you talking to me?

[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:39.440]
Yes.

[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.880]
This is West Palm Beach.

[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.140]
Well, let's see.

[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:42.860]
I do something wrong.

[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:43.780]
I went to five.

[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:45.020]
It says Fort Lauderdale.

[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:48.620]
But if you say West Palm Beach, who am I to argue with you?

[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:49.740]
Happy birthday.

[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:50.540]
Thank you.

[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:51.380]
Happy belated.

[00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:53.920]
And boy, it sure took me a long time to find you.

[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.560]
Now, let me ask you a stupid question.

[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.940]
Oh, you probably tried calling the Palm Beach line and it was busy?

[00:51:58.420 --> 00:51:58.760]
Yes.

[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.380]
So you called on a Broward line?

[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.160]
Well, no.

[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.380]
I don't know.

[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:03.400]
9463?

[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:05.800]
9463.

[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:06.820]
What is she talking about?

[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:07.520]
Does anybody know?

[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.000]
655946.

[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.040]
I'm on the wrong line.

[00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:10.580]
Oh.

[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:13.160]
I just punched up five.

[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:13.920]
I'm right here.

[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.580]
It doesn't say five.

[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:16.420]
Fort Lauderdale?

[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:19.520]
You get eight.

[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.140]
You'll get eight.

[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:20.880]
You'll get used to this, Nick.

[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:21.620]
I'm right on.

[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:22.660]
You'll get used to it.

[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.840]
Are you sure?

[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:26.200]
Wait a minute.

[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.320]
Are you on eight or five?

[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.060]
I'm serious.

[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.120]
I punched up five.

[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:31.780]
Honest to guy.

[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:32.660]
I swear to you.

[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:33.660]
All right.

[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:34.080]
I'll wait a minute.

[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:35.460]
Suppose I put her on hold.

[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:35.860]
Okay.

[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.120]
You're talking about Brown.

[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:40.740]
Yeah.

[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:41.740]
We're on five, right?

[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.560]
That's what I just said, Nick.

[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:46.880]
Oh, I was on eight.

[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:48.020]
That's hot.

[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.100]
Go ahead, man.

[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.280]
Don't let him mess you around.

[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:53.300]
He's still on the payroll of WNWS.

[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:53.760]
Go ahead, man.

[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.400]
Well, I listen to you every morning going to work.

[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.680]
And now I can't get you.

[00:52:58.740 --> 00:52:59.100]
So...

[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.140]
Well, how are you listening now?

[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:03.120]
I can only pick you up on one radio in my house.

[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.580]
I had you turned in everywhere.

[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:05.780]
Well, how is that possible?

[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:06.440]
Where do you live?

[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:08.300]
I live in West Palm Beach.

[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.020]
But I listen.

[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:09.100]
Oh, no.

[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:10.720]
We got a good signal in West Palm Beach.

[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:11.980]
The signal's a lot better now.

[00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:14.240]
But I'd listen to you when you're at Zeta.

[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:14.700]
Yeah.

[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.340]
This is a much better signal for you.

[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:17.920]
I've got a signal as much better signal.

[00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:20.020]
Zeta in Palm Beach is like shaky and so far.

[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:21.980]
Yeah, and now you can get it on all your radios now.

[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:23.760]
I can call you direct.

[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:24.440]
All right.

[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:25.180]
Isn't that exciting?

[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:25.460]

[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.180]
But I want to tell you, I love your show.

[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:29.000]
Thank you.

[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:31.140]
And I'm glad I was able to find you.

[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:34.540]
And I do listen to Lee Fowler occasionally.

[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:36.860]
Oh, well, just remember one thing, man.

[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:38.060]
Nobody's perfect, OK?

[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:38.960]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.940]
He said if I ever talk to you to say hello.

[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:42.920]
Well, I wonder how come Lee hasn't called us yet.

[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.080]
I don't know.

[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:44.960]
Come on, Lee.

[00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:45.940]
We know you're out there.

[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.020]
You closet listener.

[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:48.140]
Get on that phone, Lee.

[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.300]
Well, maybe I'll give him a call and tell him.

[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:50.560]
OK.

[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:51.260]
Yeah, do it.

[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:52.500]
And enjoy your food.

[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:55.300]
Tell Lee we sent high in the Quetzilumai material, OK?

[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:55.960]
I sure will.

[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:56.800]
Thanks a lot.

[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:57.600]
I'm talking to you.

[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:57.920]
Bye-bye.

[00:53:58.480 --> 00:53:59.720]
Now, speaking of food, I'm waiting for you.

[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:00.160]
Was she on?

[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:01.140]
No, no.

[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:01.900]
Oh, you're right.

[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.000]
She was on eight.

[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:03.420]
Yeah.

[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:04.720]
She was on eight.

[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:05.620]
How did that happen?

[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:08.060]
You got to get used to my losing it?

[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:08.380]
No.

[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.840]
I was just where I punched up five, OK?

[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:12.540]
But this is all new board and everything.

[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:13.440]
All new controls.

[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:14.980]
Yeah, but they're like marked, OK?

[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:17.000]
You'd have to be an idiot not to be able to do these.

[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.880]
OK, they're marked one, one, one, six,

[00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:20.060]
Bokapam beach.

[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.020]
You'd have to be some kind of a moron not to get these rights.

[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:24.340]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:25.660]
Which is why I'm doing so well.

[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.000]
Miramar, hello.

[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:28.120]
Hey, what's up, Neil?

[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:29.480]
Now, you are in Miramar, right, sir?

[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:30.100]
No.

[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:32.440]
You're in one?

[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:33.220]
Miami.

[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:36.440]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.660]
You know, I love consistency.

[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:38.780]
That's my thing.

[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:39.820]
Am I not online one?

[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:41.220]
I'm not in this B.

[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.240]
I just punched up.

[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.400]
Boy, this is freaky, you know?

[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.020]
I wanted to tell you a story real quick.

[00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:49.220]
How about you to go ahead, sir?

[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:52.780]
About the Miramar, not Miramar, but Metro Police Department.

[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:59.180]
They picked me up the other night for driving on this suspended license.

[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.420]
OK, this rookie job could have gave me just a ticket.

[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:07.420]
And so, you know, going down the road, but instead of me, the big damn took me in and all this kind of stuff.

[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:07.740]
Yeah.

[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:09.760]
So make long story short.

[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.640]
Am I on one or what, huh?

[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:12.740]
Now, go ahead, sir.

[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:13.300]
I'm just confused.

[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:13.600]
OK.

[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:14.720]
I've got no idea what that one is.

[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:15.600]
Stay long story short.

[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:19.860]
They put me in with a guy who is who broke.

[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:20.400]
Hello.

[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:21.820]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:22.860]
We're listening to every word.

[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:23.800]
I'm hanging on every word.

[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:24.980]
Anyway, bro, terminal.

[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:25.640]
What I'm hanging on.

[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:28.300]
Listen, just do me a sec.

[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:28.880]
OK, I'm listening.

[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.100]
Screw this story.

[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:30.580]
OK.

[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:30.660]
OK.

[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:31.820]
No, no, go ahead.

[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:32.760]
You got us this far.

[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:33.380]
Finish it.

[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:33.880]
Come on.

[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:34.240]
OK.

[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:34.940]
I got one minute.

[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:42.180]
They put me in a room when a guy who was a parobuster drug dealer possession of firearm.

[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:45.840]
Anyway, I wasn't a patrol car to take us to another jail.

[00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:48.820]
No winder designed us.

[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.800]
They put a shotgun on the front seat.

[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:55.440]
And we're driving down the, the bomb that on all of a sudden the guy says, oh hell, I'm in a mistake.

[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:56.240]
He turns around.

[00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:58.680]
He left his gun in the, in the station.

[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:00.400]
This guy gets out of the car.

[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:02.680]
The police officer now leaves me in his guy handcuffs.

[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.120]
Get out of the car.

[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:07.320]
Where the shotgun on the front seat and the keys in the car.

[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:10.920]
Yeah, and Rucker Howard came over to the car and sat down in the driver's seat.

[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:12.300]
No, no, no, no.

[00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:14.360]
And see Thomas Howell came flying out of the trunk.

[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:15.660]
Listen, listen.

[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:16.820]
OK, real quickly.

[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:18.240]
Is there going to be a favor?

[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:19.040]
They're going to get his car.

[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:22.040]
You know that one car you got with Casey Caleb?

[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:22.640]
It's coming up.

[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:22.840]
Yeah.

[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:23.920]
Casey Caleb.

[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:25.920]
That's coming up.

[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:26.680]
It's all coming up.

[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.920]
If you never get off the phone, sir, it's all coming up, OK?

[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:29.480]
OK, buddy.

[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.140]
Have a good day.

[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:30.700]
Bye-bye.

[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.340]
Do you say Casey's coming up?

[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:32.900]
Casey Caleb.

[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:34.220]
Oh, that's what he just said.

[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:35.160]
Man, this guy was incredible.

[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:36.800]
I'd have put him away for at least a couple of months.

[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.980]
OK, it's 1124 at 610 WIOD.

[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:41.040]
Reprieve.

[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:42.740]
What's Gary doing tonight?

[00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:43.740]
And who are you guys?

[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:44.520]
What's Gary doing tonight?

[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:44.520]

[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:44.560]
What's Gary doing tonight?

[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:44.560]

[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.780]
That's why inquiring minds read the Miami hero.

[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:50.060]
Is Maurice Fere really having sex with an alien from outer space?

[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:51.000]
It's in the house.

[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.200]
Is Paul Ahacken's the true mother of the elephant band.

[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:54.100]
It's in the house.

[00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:55.900]
Is John Kennedy sleeping with Max Henry?

[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:57.080]
It's in the house.

[00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:59.720]
Is Jim Baker about to get birthday's year in fall welds, baby?

[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:00.680]
It's in the house.

[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.220]
Sex, sex, sex, more.

[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:03.060]
Hot, the house.

[00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:03.980]
Oh, it's in the house.

[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.400]
Plus, Gary hearts amazing rice, diet from Florida.

[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:08.240]
A crossword puzzle that has no answer.

[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:10.200]
Our own Pulitzer Pises just for us.

[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:11.980]
I'd post love letters to Neil Rogers.

[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:15.260]
And we're so sorry, Uncle Albert, but we haven't heard the bloody thing all day.

[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:16.540]
Mindless, family rhetoric.

[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.320]
Okay, it's 1128 on 610 WIO Dina.

[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:27.580]
No.

[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:28.500]
You can't hear it.

[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:29.040]
A little bit.

[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:29.740]

[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:21.780]

[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:24.420]
Can you believe they won't let me do the news here, sir?

[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:26.260]
You know, I heard that earlier when I was listening.

[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.120]
I said, it's not going to be the same newscast.

[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:28.980]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:29.060]
Yeah.

[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:33.880]
We're going to teach Henry and April to eat while they're doing the news a little bit.

[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.340]
And make some federal sounds and mess up the names.

[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:37.660]
And it'll be just the same.

[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:38.440]
Good.

[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:42.340]
I want to throw this in every time you go to a new station.

[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.740]
I always have to bring this up.

[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.380]
And one of them is my wife, Lifhtown, with a banana.

[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:47.080]
Yeah.

[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:51.760]
I know that would work good on this WIOG for the people that would enjoy it.

[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:57.080]
And the second thing I want to ask you, as far as, I don't know, you can't tell us what you're going to be making.

[01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:58.180]
But, uh...

[01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:59.100]
No, I don't discuss now.

[01:00:59.340 --> 01:00:59.760]
I know that.

[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:01.180]
Because it gets a lot of people really upset.

[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:01.480]
Right.

[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:07.300]
But if we look at numbers and say in the long run, obviously your number is going to be a bit higher than Cain's.

[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:12.040]
And if we judge it on what his point is, or what he makes, are we kind of in the same ballpark?

[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:14.260]
No, and I don't discuss it at all.

[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:14.620]
Okay.

[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.280]
I think it's really bushly new on here and tell people what you're making.

[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:17.540]
No.

[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:18.960]
I get into a big thing about it.

[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.000]
Let me just put it this way.

[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.620]
Okay, they made me an offer that I would have had to be out of my mind to refuse.

[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.960]
That sounds good enough then.

[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:25.840]
Does that answer the question?

[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:26.980]
That takes care of you.

[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.560]
That's all matters because you're number one.

[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:32.260]
I'm going to get out of here, but I just wanted to call and say, excellent show.

[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.480]
And see what you're going to do about my wife, Lifhtown, with a banana.

[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.580]
Okay, have a great day.

[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:35.980]
Talk to you.

[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:36.480]
Bye-bye.

[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.620]
Okay, now I don't have that on Carton here yet.

[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:39.300]
We do have it.

[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.440]
I don't have it on Carton here yet.

[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:41.820]
Right.

[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.080]
But Rome wasn't filled in a day after about four hours yesterday.

[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.720]
I said to Mitch, I think I'm going to like pack up the stuff and call it a day.

[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.120]
And put the rest of the stuff away.

[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:51.460]
But look at that carousel.

[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.480]
It's already filling up.

[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:54.840]
Yeah, it's cute carousel, too, by the way.

[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.400]
It's a cute little carousel.

[01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:59.180]
Thanks a lot, Mitch, for the cute little carousel.

[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:00.060]
I like it.

[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:05.100]
And another thing, we're going to have to have Jay America and a lot of those other people, the four listeners.

[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.980]
And who are the other guys that did a whole bunch of stuff.

[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:09.900]
They did bye-bye by the way.

[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.540]
Now, as I got in here by the way.

[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:12.900]
Oh, good.

[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:15.400]
That's some Miami City cops, I believe.

[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:16.540]
Yeah, but they had a name.

[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.880]
Yes, they did have a name.

[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:19.600]
KJ and the losers.

[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.240]
Exactly.

[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:25.120]
We're going to have to have them do a lot of stuff for us because obviously we don't, we can't use the ACN material.

[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:25.880]
You believe I can.

[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:26.540]
We have no intent.

[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.640]
I really can't.

[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.080]
I have a lot of crap.

[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:29.740]
A lot of crap.

[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:29.980]
Long term.

[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:30.120]

[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:32.180]
KJ and the losers.

[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.120]
Okay, we have a spy report in Palm Beach.

[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:34.460]
Hello.

[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.120]
Hello.

[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.020]
Now, I know it's you because I punched up the one that says Palm Beach.

[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.220]
And if you're not in Palm Beach, man, I'm giving up right now.

[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.240]
Are you?

[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:41.820]
Yeah.

[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:42.240]
Great.

[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:43.220]
Hey, good.

[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:44.640]
Happy birthday, great show.

[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.120]
Thank you.

[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:46.700]
I got about 45 seconds.

[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:52.480]
Okay, last week, Thursday, Alice was babbling on about the election in the negative campaigning.

[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:56.220]
And all of a sudden, at a clear boost guy, he says I'm putting Rogers on notice.

[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.500]
Yeah, I heard about that.

[01:02:58.540 --> 01:02:59.240]
What does that mean?

[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:01.880]
He said he's putting Rogers on notice.

[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.780]
And I'm not going to put up with this stuff this time.

[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:08.280]
Okay, well, listen, I'm glad you inspired me because right after the news break, I got something special for Alice.

[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:09.180]
That's right.

[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:09.820]
Trust me.

[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:10.260]
Do it.

[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:10.740]
Okay.

[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:11.880]
How did I say it?

[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:12.200]
You too.

[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.340]
Yeah, I told you to hold this.

[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:14.540]
I knew it would work out.

[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.780]
I knew it would work out.

[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:16.640]
Good time out perfectly.

[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:21.080]
Okay, April Wortham's got a W.I.O.D. news update and we'll come back at 1134.

[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:35.380]
I'm going to put this thing on notice.

[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.720]
I'm going to put this thing on notice.

[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.500]
I'm going to put this thing on notice.

[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.380]
I'm going to put this thing on notice.

[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.400]
I'm going to put this thing on notice.

[01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:02.060]
I'm going to put this thing on notice.

[01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:04.000]
I'm going to put this thing on notice.

[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:04.000]

[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:04.160]
I'm going to put this thing on notice.

[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.220]
I'm going to put this thing on notice.

[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:11.280]
I'm going to put this thing on notice.

[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.360]
I'm going to put this thing on notice.

[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.300]
Inala Lorry.

[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:20.340]
I still in the North Park or Stay In Prints a Hitting a AdaTooN.

[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.960]
I was in the bass line.

[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:23.560]
I was in the bass line.

[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.060]
Inala Offside With Caroline muts the dead.

[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.280]
In the bass line.

[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.420]
I want to win a go.

[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.400]
Okay, now you think Alice is going to be upset about that.

[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.880]
I mean, what is that about putting us on notice? What does that mean?

[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.580]
A notice for what?

[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.400]
He's like an take it anymore.

[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.820]
He's not going to take it anymore.

[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.160]
He's not going to take it anymore.

[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:43.560]
What?

[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:47.200]
Now, the last time that I was on in midday,

[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.060]
Alice was also on in midday,

[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.540]
and I had a nine, and he had a two-five,

[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:52.740]
or something like that in the ratings,

[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.000]
and then he ran off at the afternoon.

[01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:59.280]
And I will say this, he did pick up a lot of Stan's audience,

[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.600]
once a major went off the air,

[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:03.220]
but he's got those ancient demographics.

[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.240]
Okay, that's a problem, that whole station.

[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:07.380]
Ancient demographics.

[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.860]
Well, what is he worried about?

[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:15.800]
I saw on the program schedule that Kane is going to have Jack Sturdy in here in a week or two.

[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:20.740]
We can ask Jack Sturdy about it, see what the story is.

[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:21.480]
Okay.

[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.800]
All right, so 1141 at WIOD,

[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.340]
the NeoRodger show here on a Monday, we're just delighted.

[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:30.100]
We want to thank Tony Romas and Johnny G's and the eats and freeze.

[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:31.960]
And God only knows what else.

[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:34.580]
Now, that Palm Beach line is not lit, is it?

[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.080]
Is it out?

[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:37.920]
Now, that's embarrassing, okay, we've got a Palm Beach line.

[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:39.740]
You remember all the people we used to have from Palm Beach,

[01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:42.580]
who we call, and have to pay for it and chew us out,

[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:43.860]
because we didn't have a Palm Beach line.

[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.400]
Now, we're into it.

[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.560]
255 WIOD.

[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:47.420]
I get very anxious.

[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:48.560]
All the lines aren't lit.

[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:49.660]
All eight lines aren't lit.

[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:50.300]
See, it's aesthetic.

[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:51.620]
We're into aesthetics.

[01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:53.120]
We like it to look good.

[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:54.580]
We don't care who's on there.

[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.040]
Exactly.

[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.760]
We probably won't even talk to them, okay?

[01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.060]
But we want somebody on the damn line, all right?

[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.540]
Okay, now let's go to Fort Lauderdale on six.

[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.480]
I don't know how it is when I punch one up,

[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.640]
it's not the one that I punch.

[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:06.480]
This is exciting.

[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.900]
Over and over again, okay?

[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.280]
I think they're having a little fun with us in there.

[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.580]
I think they're like twisting him around like,

[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:12.440]
what is that show with Wink Martin Dale?

[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:13.540]
Where they do it.

[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:14.400]
Is it Tic-Tac-Doh?

[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.780]
You know, where they switch the categories and they move all around?

[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.420]
Okay, a Fort Lauderdale.

[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:18.640]
Hello.

[01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:21.180]
Yeah, since this is your first day in IOD,

[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:23.540]
some people may not have heard you before.

[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.640]
Do you think you should announce that you're a fairy?

[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:26.760]
Oh, yeah, a fairy.

[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.160]
And that's, we fly too, sir.

[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.160]
Okay, we have our own airlines.

[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:29.960]
I believe it.

[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.200]
Okay, good luck, you see.

[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:32.880]
Okay, hi, I have a nice day.

[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:33.500]
What a call.

[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:34.080]
Yeah.

[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:34.700]
Boy.

[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:36.780]
That wasn't a Palm Beach line.

[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:37.080]
A fairy.

[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:40.500]
He's a very nice listener to it.

[01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:42.180]
It's 11.40 to 18, you'll know it at WIOD.

[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.560]
And let's go to see what they like to do is throw that in there.

[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.540]
What they don't realize, it gets another like two points.

[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:49.680]
Yeah, every time.

[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.980]
Because it brings all the queens out of the closet.

[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:57.400]
Not in my not saying that in any relationship to anything that we played in the last couple of minutes, okay?

[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.880]
Or said or said.

[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:00.640]
Okay, Boca, hello.

[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:01.760]
Hello, Neil.

[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:02.880]
Hi.

[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:03.620]
How you doing?

[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:04.220]
Pretty good.

[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:06.240]
See, happy birthday a little bit late.

[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.360]
Thank you so much, sir.

[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:08.900]
And I would say how you're wings today.

[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:09.960]
Pardon?

[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.220]
Go ahead, I'm just kidding.

[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:12.500]
Fine.

[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:15.820]
I'm the guy from the clown colleges on WIOD.

[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:16.940]
He's going on this and on here.

[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:19.040]
I'd also like to say happy birthday to my friend Tracy.

[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:20.900]
Happy birthday, Tracy.

[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:21.920]
It's against them.

[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.820]
I know, but go ahead.

[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:23.360]
Uh-huh.

[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:29.620]
Also, I'd like to give you a little spy report of the upcoming format change at data 4.

[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:30.040]
Yeah.

[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:31.320]
This is a preview.

[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:34.360]
Yeah, he's, I have to watch up and down from my water.

[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:36.080]
He needs some tortillas and he needs them.

[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:37.380]
That's it.

[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.160]
You got it.

[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.280]
That should be good for about a one, two, shouldn't it?

[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:42.140]
Well, Dave speaks Spanish, so he'll be covered.

[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:42.860]
What that is?

[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:43.580]
Uh-huh.

[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:44.360]
I'll still away go.

[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:44.820]
Uh-huh.

[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:47.120]
Why do you keep waiting, sir?

[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.660]
You're a great caller, but you have this.

[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.740]
It's like it's like the before and the after and he started out.

[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:52.320]
Uh-huh.

[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:53.780]
And now he's doing, uh-huh.

[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:54.940]
You notice that?

[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.540]
I'm butching up a little bit.

[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:57.760]
You're going to have to work on this, sir.

[01:08:57.820 --> 01:08:58.940]
You're going to have to get out of your system.

[01:08:59.280 --> 01:08:59.340]
Yeah.

[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:00.940]
I thought I'd butch up a little.

[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:01.240]
Okay.

[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.020]
After that last call, yeah.

[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:03.220]
Right.

[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:05.680]
Uh-huh.

[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:06.420]
Anyway, uh- I wouldn't know.

[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:07.700]
Would you be playing blowfly?

[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:08.800]
No.

[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:09.340]
No.

[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:10.440]
Remember that?

[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.380]
Oh, we don't have it.

[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:11.720]
No.

[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:13.620]
No, they burn that in the back yard.

[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:14.120]
Oh.

[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:14.660]
Yeah.

[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:17.060]
They burn that in the Rick Edwards Memorial field out there.

[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.320]
I think that's, that's true.

[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:18.840]
Yeah.

[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:19.380]
They did.

[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:20.460]
They had a little burning session.

[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:23.380]
Well, listen, it's great hearing from your serial.

[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:24.800]
Wonderful caller and work on it.

[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:25.060]
Okay.

[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:25.360]
All right.

[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:25.660]
Thank you.

[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:26.600]
Okay. Good luck to you.

[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:29.740]
The only thing I can think of that I miss from Zeta 4 is the Santa

[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:30.280]
Real House.

[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:30.620]
Oh, wait a minute.

[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:31.380]
He was on 6.

[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.440]
I do miss that.

[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.360]
I think I just disconnected the caller in Boca.

[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.180]
Oh, God.

[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.840]
Boy, I'm really a mess, you know.

[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.260]
Well, everybody's got to understand it's the first day.

[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.520]
I just don't understand that I keep pressing off.

[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:44.460]
Okay, let's move along.

[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:47.380]
Okay, because there's nothing that irritates me more listening than hearing

[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:50.240]
some douchebag on a ear who just can't get the technical stuff down.

[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.120]
He keeps fumbling around and munking.

[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:53.900]
I just press on and good luck to you.

[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:54.480]
Okay.

[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:56.320]
This is a mobile and Palm Beach.

[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:57.080]
Neil.

[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:57.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:58.300]
How you doing?

[01:09:58.540 --> 01:09:58.900]
Okay.

[01:09:59.260 --> 01:09:59.800]
Hey, bird.

[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:00.500]
Hey.

[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.680]
This is the boat doctor.

[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.260]
How are you?

[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.340]
The boat doctor.

[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.860]
Now, you remember he related to the tree doctor?

[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:06.660]
No.

[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:07.820]
We had this man.

[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.340]
No matter the fact he stole my name.

[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:13.320]
We had your picture on the bulletin board at Zeta 4 with more Ganna.

[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:13.860]
That's right.

[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:14.820]
Remember that picture, Neil?

[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:15.700]
On the bulletin board?

[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:15.860]
Yeah.

[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:17.380]
I'm sure that's the boat doctor.

[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:23.220]
Now I've got something new for this new holiday season which I am imposing in a card,

[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:25.060]
a birthday card for Neil.

[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:27.260]
So that will be sent out shortly.

[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.900]
So take a look before you'll see.

[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.100]
Can you give us any hints?

[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:31.880]
No, no, no.

[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:35.460]
In fact, a pike has seen it because I dropped him off.

[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:36.340]
What it is?

[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.320]
What is it I want to tell you?

[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:37.660]
I'm going to say?

[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:38.440]
Mike and Erie.

[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.260]
Who are you going to say?

[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:42.580]
We're going to keep it a little secret and you'll have it by the end of the week.

[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:43.360]
Okay, sir.

[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:44.300]
Let me ask you a question.

[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:46.020]
Have you heard of the mystery picker?

[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:46.520]
Yes.

[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:47.260]
Okay.

[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:49.760]
For an nominal fee, I'll tell you who it is.

[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:50.180]
Okay.

[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.500]
Because I do know who it is.

[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:51.720]
All right.

[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.280]
Now, which nostril is that involved, sir?

[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:53.980]
The writer, the left.

[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:54.560]
Both.

[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:55.080]
Okay.

[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:55.840]
A little of both.

[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.660]
What I'm calling about, I have both Uncle Bonzai album.

[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:00.100]
Ah!

[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:06.320]
And I would be honored if you would take him and then tape off him.

[01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:07.300]
Boy, that would be great.

[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.500]
How are you going to get him here?

[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:10.200]
Are you going to mail him to us?

[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.540]
Both, doctor.

[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:14.100]
He was in a car phone and we just lost.

[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:15.180]
He'll take care of it.

[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:16.440]
No, he didn't.

[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.060]
Trust me.

[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:17.960]
I didn't touch anything.

[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:18.260]
Okay.

[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.720]
But that does happen on his car phone.

[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:20.780]
And he got disconnected.

[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:23.700]
But I'm sure he's still listening and the thing to do either to mail it to us,

[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.020]
or he can drive all the way down here if he's a fool and bring him here.

[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.900]
But that's a long schlep from Palm Beach.

[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:30.220]
Nobody's that crazy.

[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.680]
But if he mails him to us, you know, puts him in one of those mailers, record mailers,

[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:37.520]
and we'll take good care of him and we'll dub him off and we'll send him back.

[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:38.340]
Yeah.

[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:38.840]
Okay.

[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:38.840]

[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:41.280]
Okay, 1146 at WIOD.

[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:44.240]
Steve this afternoon is going to have a fist fight in the studio.

[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:47.860]
We're going to have blacks for Bush and blacks for New Caucus.

[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:51.000]
And then we're going to have some blacks who say the hell with both of them.

[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:51.300]
Okay.

[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:52.820]
So we're going to like spread it all around.

[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:57.060]
Now, didn't you say last week that blacks for Bush is the same as Jews for Hitler?

[01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:57.500]
Exactly.

[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:58.580]
Something like that.

[01:11:58.580 --> 01:11:59.140]
Very close.

[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:03.160]
Now, if Nick tells us he's voting for Bush, I'm going to get really hysteria.

[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.060]
You're not voting for Bush.

[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:04.680]
Are you?

[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:05.340]
He says no.

[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:06.880]
He says the hell with both of them, right?

[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.600]
These are going to vote for New Caucus because he never stole a freight train.

[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:10.900]
Okay.

[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.480]
And besides he needs the vote desperately.

[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:13.300]
Yeah.

[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:17.460]
I want to say this and I realize that in fact, we're going to be on the air during voting tomorrow.

[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:18.360]
Do you realize that?

[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:18.360]

[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:22.840]
Which is going to make a big impact in Florida, where Bush is only about 172 points ahead.

[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:25.520]
But that's Senate race, man.

[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:34.000]
If we can't do better than Connie Mack and McKay, buddy McKay, that's got to be two of the worst yeehawks that I've ever seen in my life.

[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:35.460]
Talk about red necks.

[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.020]
Where did Barrow say they were in Lakeland today?

[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:38.320]
Yeah.

[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:38.840]
Hang on.

[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.440]
You want to know they're probably at the ABC level right now.

[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:42.920]
I think it's XYZ now.

[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:43.780]
Unbelievable.

[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:44.740]
Okay.

[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.420]
We're going to go to Palm Beach again.

[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:49.760]
Man, he's got like a Palm Beach fetish.

[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.480]
But you know something it's good because that's an easy one for me to get because it says Palm Beach on the line.

[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:53.840]
Hello.

[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:54.780]
Hey, hello, Neil.

[01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:55.420]
Yes, sir.

[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:56.060]
Congratulations.

[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:57.620]
Are you mobile, sir?

[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:58.320]
I am mobile.

[01:12:58.460 --> 01:12:59.160]
I'll be damned.

[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:00.040]
Hey, that's great.

[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:00.960]
Talkin' to Neil.

[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:01.520]
Yeah.

[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:03.180]
Get the hell out of here, pal.

[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:04.040]
Hey, listen.

[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:04.500]
Yeah.

[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.660]
You were talkin' about trying to be number three.

[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:07.120]
Yeah.

[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:09.800]
What you got to do is bet on Robert the Creighton Woodhouse.

[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:10.920]
He always comes in third.

[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:11.660]
Oh, now come on.

[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.360]
Be nice, sir.

[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:14.400]
Bobby Woodhouse has never met a horse he didn't like.

[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:17.380]
Yeah, but he always runs a five to two and he comes in third.

[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:19.000]
Well, what are you betting on him for, sir?

[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.880]
It sounds like sour grapes to me.

[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:21.440]
Nice.

[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:22.240]
My bank.

[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:23.780]
In fact, tomorrow is Tuesday.

[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:25.280]
That means the car will be open tomorrow.

[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.060]
That's right.

[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.700]
Giving you our pick for the day, okay?

[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:29.420]
Speaking of the mystery picker.

[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:31.300]
He's a wonderful lady.

[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:32.040]
Who's that?

[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.200]
The mystery picker.

[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:33.900]
Oh, yeah, is she?

[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.740]
Yeah, she's about one for ten.

[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.120]
I thought she was Hank Goldberg.

[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.000]
Yeah, Hank Goldberg.

[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.460]
These people are all confused.

[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:43.140]
You know, I heard him talkin' to the mystery picker and it was a woman.

[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:43.860]
Yeah.

[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:45.960]
Now, Nick says the mystery picker is Hank.

[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:46.880]
Yeah.

[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:47.740]
And we don't know.

[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.040]
We don't know what it is.

[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.700]
Hey, Neil, congratulations to an elephant job.

[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.320]
Thank you, sir.

[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:54.720]
You're a wonderful American and have a great day and stay off the roads.

[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:55.360]
Will you please?

[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:56.300]
Yeah, get out of here.

[01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:56.640]
Okay.

[01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:00.600]
Now, obviously it's going to take a few days to sort this mystery picker thing out.

[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:00.900]
I know.

[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:04.560]
That's, to me, that was the heaviest thing that I heard all morning was that mystery picker, man.

[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:05.140]
I went nuts.

[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.780]
There's obviously a lot to this.

[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:10.000]
Because it was reminiscent of the day we came in here and Reneery came back

[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.640]
for that press conference at five o'clock.

[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:15.140]
And there were three grown men that were yanking on his left elbow,

[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.640]
trying to pull it out of his nose, right?

[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:20.100]
The most embarrassing scene I have ever seen in my life.

[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.200]
And I got this where they did it just before five.

[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:25.260]
Just in the nicotine, they got it out of there.

[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:27.460]
And then he came in here, started smoking and came when Craig.

[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.480]
Oh, that was incredible.

[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:31.640]
See, I mean, one thing I got to say, the atmosphere in this building,

[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:35.340]
it's like a real radio station and people are friendly, but you do sense

[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:40.040]
there is just a little, little, undercurrent of tension.

[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:40.980]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.520]
In other words, most of the people are really nice and friendly,

[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:46.680]
but there are certain rivalries that exist in the building.

[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:47.000]
Okay?

[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:48.140]
Rivalry.

[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:52.880]
Like, for example, Steve in the sports department are just a little bit at odds.

[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:53.740]
Okay?

[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:56.740]
Because I noticed when Sonny left this morning, he had his steepkin,

[01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:59.560]
Boudoudal, and he was sticking pins in it on his way out of the building.

[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:03.560]
I imagine, but I just have, because we don't want it to be too syrupy.

[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:03.900]
Okay?

[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:05.940]
We don't work well in that kind of a thing.

[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:07.180]
I don't think you have to worry about it.

[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:09.960]
Everybody loves each other and just tickles all over each other.

[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:13.280]
We like like every once in a couple of weeks, a little blood bath out in the hall is good.

[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:14.760]
Okay?

[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:17.820]
So 1150, 10 till noon on 610, WIOD.

[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:20.820]
Here's what 55 and WIOD, then you'll run your show.

[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:22.180]
This is our inaugural show at WIOD.

[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:28.920]
We want to thank everybody for being so wonderful and syrupy and the cooperative and everything.

[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.180]
And we want to thank Mother M's Cookies.

[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.860]
The food is coming in here, man.

[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:36.160]
You think that we were having a fundraiser for the Commodore Cross.

[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:40.500]
By the way, I noticed that they were in more power to them because it's my favorite charity in town.

[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:45.500]
I noticed that the morning show, and I was listening to coming to work, was raising money for the Camilla's house.

[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:47.000]
Yeah.

[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.220]
I heard that, too.

[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:48.920]
Wasn't that interesting?

[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:52.380]
Wasn't it a station that we're like, doing all of our cards?

[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:52.720]
Yeah.

[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:53.900]
I thought it was that.

[01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:55.860]
But that's okay, because like I said, Dave's a great guy.

[01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:56.520]
I wish him all the luck.

[01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:02.260]
But Mother M's Cookies is in over an incredible batch of chocolate chip cookies and they've got M&M's in them.

[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:02.940]
Yeah, my favorite.

[01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:04.840]
It is.

[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:07.680]
It's too bad I can't eat all that sugary sweet stuff.

[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:08.060]
Yeah.

[01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:10.480]
But anyway, we want to thank Lou.

[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:11.820]
No, Laurie.

[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:12.460]
Laurie.

[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:14.320]
Laurie would be surprised if her name turned to Lou.

[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:19.820]
Laurie, Joey Lee and Cindy at Mother M's Cookies and they have a digital beaper.

[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:20.760]
Wow.

[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.040]
Is there number?

[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.740]
Should I give that or should I give their address?

[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.100]
Do they address again?

[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:27.640]
8520 Southwest 133rd Avenue.

[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:28.760]
Avenue Road.

[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:29.500]
Uh-huh.

[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:30.840]
In Miami.

[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:31.940]
Avenue Road.

[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:35.920]
That is that 8520 Southwest 133rd Avenue Road.

[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.180]
In Miami.

[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:38.900]
That is bizarre.

[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.800]
I wonder they got a digital beaper.

[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:43.900]
Anyway, we thank them very much and let's take a call from Water Hill.

[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:44.220]
Hello.

[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:45.040]
Neil.

[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:45.540]
Yeah.

[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:46.800]
This is Dem's bro.

[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:47.980]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:48.400]
Good.

[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:52.120]
Congratulations on the move to WIOD.

[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:52.740]
Thank you.

[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:53.860]
How come you're not in school today?

[01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:56.580]
I was fortunate enough to have a two-fake.

[01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:57.880]
Oh, great.

[01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.340]
That's a good excuse always, isn't it?

[01:16:59.340 --> 01:16:59.740]
Yeah, it's a good excuse.

[01:16:59.740 --> 01:16:59.740]

[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:01.360]
But that one's true this time.

[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.800]
Listen, here's a good idea for you.

[01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:09.620]
Take a piece of string tied around about four of your teeth and tied to the door knob and run like a bat out of hell.

[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:10.780]
I tried that one.

[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:11.600]
It works great.

[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:13.360]
Um, Happy Belated Birthday.

[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:14.300]
Thank you.

[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.540]
And Glenn, congratulations for the move too.

[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:17.320]
All the way up.

[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:17.660]
Thank you.

[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:19.480]
You sound very similar to STEM.

[01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:20.440]
No, he does not.

[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:23.180]
I'm better than STEM.

[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:24.040]
Oh, really?

[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:24.440]
Yeah.

[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.260]
Well, we don't want to get in that way.

[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:29.360]
I get into the thing because stems very sensitive

[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:33.680]
He's been under a lot of derest and a lot of pressure and we want to make sure that you know

[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.720]
We take all the pressure off now. He has the same sort of speed no he doesn't

[01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:43.380]
You don't sound anything like him do you now stems a literate? Well, that's true. This is very true

[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:47.940]
And we've been working on him diligently but it doesn't seem to help where there's no sense. There's no feeling

[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:53.720]
Yeah, I guess that everybody calling up and saying the first I could I could be the first you know caller under 19

[01:17:53.720 --> 01:18:01.560]
Yeah, now you're like what 14. Yeah, are you yeah? Now this is Adam. Yeah, say I'm a sharp as a monster ball today right Adam

[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:07.880]
Yeah, my sure am and with faces, okay? Now, what are you gonna send your picture over with stem?

[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:10.520]
Just a joke Adam you're only

[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:16.180]
He's old. It's just a little joke right? Yeah, okay, listen have a wonderful day. I hope you get your tooth straight now, okay

[01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:21.780]
I'm good luck with the show. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Well, how nice and that great. That was the mysterious stems mysterious brother

[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:26.160]
Uh-huh, okay Miami. Hello. Yeah, Neil. How you doing great?

[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:29.200]
Welcome to AM. Thank you so much sir. Welcome back to AM

[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:32.280]
You know, listen, I want to clarify you on the mystery

[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.700]
Picker if you would put me on

[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:39.240]
I will tell you when the mystery picker is I don't want to know

[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:43.720]
Am I stepping on something here that's like really a big secret because I'm just joking about it

[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:48.380]
But is it really a big deal? Yeah, oh, yeah, oh it is we can we can dump it out, you know

[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:51.240]
I you know if you put me on hold with the bird I will tell the bird

[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:55.180]
Now we'll just dump it out. I'll dump it. I won't let it on the other only

[01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:58.880]
Really? Okay, and I dumped that okay. Did that work?

[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:04.900]
Okay, is there anything I can get for that meal? You make me hungry over the airway. Yeah, we'll send you some cookies

[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:09.720]
Okay, we'll send you whatever is left over we'll send you some of the crust from the pizza from Johnny G's

[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:12.800]
That's cross and we'll send you some of the bones from a Tony Romans, okay?

[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:18.440]
In fact, we'll even send you some of the bones from the junior title causeways that okay?

[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:21.820]
No, I'll tell you to better now. Okay. Well, that's the best it's our first day

[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:26.760]
I mean what do you expect like a big operation here on the first day? No, but this is classified stuff

[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:33.260]
Okay, we appreciate it. Well, how do you know? How do you know this? I got the inside track, but I'll be darned

[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:35.600]
He probably saw the telltale markings of that fingernail

[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:40.500]
That's how you tell the mystery picker every time. Okay, listen fat. You're a great guy. I appreciate it

[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:41.620]
Thanks, Neil. Thanks a lot

[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:46.720]
Okay, also want to thank the people at the mother Am's cookies who set us and

[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:50.620]
I'm not sure I don't understand it because it says W I O D on the top of the record

[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:57.520]
It's a 45 and on one side it says never again or owed to Zeta for by Laurie Hannan and on the other side

[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:03.840]
It says lonely DJ or owed to Joey Wow, so I'm gonna have to listen to these probably get him on

[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:06.700]
We'll debut them here tomorrow exclusively on the Neil Rogers show

[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:11.640]
Okay, April Wortham is back with the news coming up at noon and then we'll be back at 12.05 two more hours to go

[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:16.240]
Steve be along at two as always here on 6.10 W I O D

[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:21.320]
W I O D

[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:21.880]
Brandt

[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:28.160]
Fortwater Day of talk with Steve Kane this afternoon at two on news talk radio 6 and W I O D

[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:41.960]
To get in touch and talk call 751 W I O D and day 524 W I O D and broard or 655 and 278 W I O D in the Palm Beach

[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:49.240]
Other areas make all collect the opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station now

[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:53.860]
Here's Neil Rogers on news talk radio 610 W I O D

[01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:58.000]
12.06 W I O D and did you say the ribs are gone gone?

[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.260]
Gone thick clean. It was incredible. Yeah, see that's one thing about you know radio station and what was that?

[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:09.300]
Did you just hear that? What was it that was like a line? What was that Nick?

[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:17.240]
Was did I imagine that and you just you're relying disconnecting? No, I didn't hear him. Okay. I must be losing my mind. Okay. I swear to you

[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.800]
This this phone thing is bizarre. It's gonna take me a couple of days

[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:27.300]
But anyway, being in a radio station no matter how much food comes in you can always be confident if you lay it out in the in the cafeteria

[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:30.000]
Mm-hmm within 20 minutes. It's gone

[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:34.980]
And we're not complaining about that. No, that's what we want. Yeah, that's the idea

[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:41.900]
We're gonna feed these people by the time six months goes by instead of all these anorexic looking people on diets walking around here

[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:46.380]
They're gonna be walking to gonna make me look like Mickey Mouse. Okay. That's the idea

[01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:49.720]
See, I don't know about a little meat on the bones of these people for crying out loud

[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:55.840]
I don't know about mother Rogers, but my mother always taught me never to let food go to waste exactly always use it

[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:59.480]
And it's like candy. Yeah, I shouldn't be eating now or this cookie

[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:00.460]
I know eating that

[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:05.940]
Well, we're on the airs from one of more disgusting things to some of these people from mother M you watch

[01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:10.480]
It'll be calls coming and he's eating on the air. It's the most disgusting thing

[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.240]
How can you let him do that? Yeah

[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:16.460]
Let me tell you something that's worth at least two points in a book, okay

[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:23.260]
Told you budding broadcasters out there just get food brought in and just make a slawbottie yourself and that'll do it

[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:25.920]
That would we ever discover?

[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:29.840]
You hanging around my house and I want to talk to you about what is it mr. Bush?

[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:32.840]
I'm gonna put it this way. Yeah, wasn't you

[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:39.120]
Did the pushin put the sands upon the cushion put prints on the dashboard upside down

[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:48.180]
Wasn't you you brocco billed in messing with my daughter Jill if it was you'd better leave this town

[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:49.440]
Yes

[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:10.080]
Yeah

[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:10.080]

[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.780]
Okay, it's

[01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:16.560]
And shall we go back to the phones down see how many of these I can screw up

[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:20.880]
We got that clown college caller on six. Should I get him on now? Yeah, sure. Oh friend of ours

[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:24.380]
See all some time to do these out of order next gonna get started getting hysterical about that

[01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:26.840]
He doesn't carry you see you along with

[01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:33.200]
Are you there? Yeah, I'm here. I'm doing I'm not bad. I you everybody loves a clown. That's what they say

[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:35.760]
That's what Gary Lewis said look what it did for him

[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:40.840]
That's only gonna job with a circus. Are you cereal doing what I'm working with client BD8?

[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:43.060]
Fantastic

[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:50.380]
Now this is a young man for the benefit of the audience. This is a young guy who went to clown college over on a West Coast in Venice

[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:53.420]
What was it Venice? Yeah Venice and

[01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:57.840]
He want to be a clown and here he is. He got a job and everybody can go see him where

[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:03.480]
Um, it starts into land and I don't know if I can come back down and start off load again because they bought the land

[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:08.040]
They used to use and they make them all out of it. Wow, but they might come into Miami. I don't know

[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:12.000]
I haven't got the schedule yet. That's great. So in other words, you're gonna be on the road all the time

[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:18.220]
Well, that's what you always wanted to do. This is your dream come true, right? That's all right

[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:22.060]
Well, we're happy about it. We're excited for it. All right. I want to have the bread today. Thank you

[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:26.880]
Can't believe you followed us over here. Oh, hey, why not listen?

[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:30.480]
Listen, I want to give you a little assignment before you go heading off to the land or any place else

[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:34.840]
And this is true for every one of our listeners because word of mouth is what it's all about

[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:39.040]
I guarantee you there are a lot of people a lot of our pinheads out there. Don't know where we are yet. Okay

[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:44.160]
All right, so you have to spread the word like go out with sandwich boards and walk up and down Lincoln Road mall stuff like that

[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.160]
You may remember I made a call into the Steve Cain show last Friday that horrible, sir and I

[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:37.240]
And I brought up mr. Scydom in the name who I refer to on the air now you're really getting horrible

[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:42.840]
Listen, I refer to him as a scum sucking maggots similar in quality to reptile excrement. Do you remember the call?

[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.360]
Ha ha ha no

[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:53.480]
Yeah, of course I remember you'll never believe what happened on Friday evening. What's that I showed up at the playoff to see the fights? Uh-huh

[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:56.340]
Steve Cain was there with Rick with Rick

[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:03.180]
Sucking maggot he's into this male bonding thing now. You know what I'm saying? It was he rickan is lovely wife Laurie

[01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:09.480]
I've been into that male bonding thing for a long time, but Steve's just getting into it. Okay. Yeah, this gets worse. Yes, sir

[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.640]
The scum sucking maggot was with him. Yeah

[01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:17.160]
Steve comes over and I introduce myself to him and he remembers me and he said I want you to come over and say hello to Rick

[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:18.500]
I said no, thank you

[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:23.520]
He said you got to come over he's a great guy. Yeah, I resisted initially

[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:27.000]
I want to tell you that I did and I told you you'd be a hypocrite if you ever did this

[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.340]
That's correct. I did resist

[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:31.060]
But he offered to buy me a drink so I went

[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:35.920]
It gets worse. Okay

[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:36.040]
I

[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:42.500]
Spent the night with Rick's item and Steve Cain what what I said at the same table

[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:47.040]
I looked across and Rick's item and said you're a scum sucking maggot. Yeah

[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:51.540]
But you know what at the end of the night. I can't believe I'm saying this

[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:58.980]
He's not that bad a guy. Oh my god. Neil. Oh Steve had some very nice things to say about you

[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:05.460]
Yeah, and what about Rick? I haven't had nothing bad to say. Oh, I see he didn't have anything good to say

[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:09.600]
But he didn't have anything bad to say while he's a hell of a guy and I appreciate the call sir

[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:14.180]
But don't ever call a show again. Okay, you've copped out here's a guy who was accusing me remember what he said

[01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:15.940]
He intimidated me. He said if you ever

[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:19.560]
You know say anything nice about this guy or try to be a sprain

[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.520]
I will never speak to you again and here's the guy right away

[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:23.600]
He's sucking up to him because he bought him a drink. Yeah

[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:29.200]
Sir, I think you're qualified to be in the business now. Okay an official W.I.O.D. Freeloter

[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:34.740]
You know, that's right. It was a terrible story. It was horrendous. How was it? What do you say? How horrible? It was

[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:37.020]
1213 at 610 W.I.O.D.

[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:41.120]

1217 to W.I.O.D. Boy these are incredible these headphones. These are the worst. They're bad. Whoo

[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:57.500]
No, I just gave you mine so I could wear these

[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:04.580]
No wonder Keen doesn't wear these I mean these are these are like barely it sounds like you're in a uh like in the Arabian desert

[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:12.160]
Okay, so you hang on to those you're sound wonderful. Yeah, perfect. Well those I bought myself you don't think those cheapskates over there Bobby headphones do

[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:19.740]
No, but these are horrendous many sound like you're way off like way down a hall somewhere like a channel seven

[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:23.120]
Now do we really have Rick weaver on the show

[01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:29.360]
Coming up, but I don't mean like live, but on tape are you serious to instead every day or just on Monday

[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:31.920]
Every day what's he do?

[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:35.900]
He taught just a minute mr. Weaver to you, okay

[01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:40.460]
Just remember that mr. Weaver to you. I met him coming up in just a few minutes

[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:44.460]
Well listen, I know just like he had all those dinners with AJ do we at the S.A.D

[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:48.640]
This man has got the most incredible imagination. Yeah, AJ remember all those great lunches

[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:54.900]
We used to have at the S.A.D. Who the hell are you? They were dinners. Oh dinners great. Okay, let's go to um

[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:57.100]
Getting choked up from all the steam food, okay

[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:02.720]
From that candy was delicious, but my god. How much food can you eat? It's everywhere. Hollywood. Hello

[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:09.040]
Yeah, hi, welcome. They're welcome. They're again. Oh my god. It's Steve from Hollywood. I didn't think you'd recognize him

[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:15.060]
No, of course not Steve listen. I heard I heard on your last broadcast. You're gonna have your birthday with Bill Caltor. How is he doing?

[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:18.840]
Uh, I don't know. I haven't seen Bill in a few days

[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:21.760]
I thought you said you're gonna go to the caller with him or something

[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:25.600]
I'm not it didn't work. I'd never heard from him any. I think he's going through change of life for something

[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:29.240]
I don't know what's going on with Bill, but last few days I've been getting these strange vibes

[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:33.840]
And he gave my home number to Bob Lasseter and since then I've been just a little bit leery

[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.580]
You know, I think he just needs a little rest

[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.960]
He said a rough year. Oh

[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:42.000]
True. Yeah, well, I'm not I'm not making that up either. I'm not joking or just something

[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.920]
Something in the ear there. I don't know what it was see what happened is I forgot his wife's birthday again

[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:47.440]
Oh

[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:50.820]
And he made some little last time we spoke which is about a week ago

[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:55.860]
He made some little cost and comment about how a Mary Ellen's birthday which just passed, you know

[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:58.800]
And I just you know, I've had all this stuff going on and I forgot

[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:03.940]
And I have a feeling that he just to harbor some hostility about that. I could be wrong

[01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:05.240]
But you know me I'm very sensitive

[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:09.260]
Yeah, well so is Bill is there recall? Yeah, extremely so yeah

[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:13.020]
If anybody had any idea what's been going on in our lives in the last month

[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:16.560]
Yeah, the last a few weeks have been pretty hectic. You can imagine, okay? Yeah

[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:18.880]
Well, listen, I just sort of call up and wish you well

[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:22.240]
And the only one thing and I hope you don't get mad at me now, but you might after I say this

[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:26.240]
I wish you'd have left Ed McMahon wherever you was. Oh, jeez

[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:32.580]
Ed McMahon, yeah, well, I mean my cackling friend right. Oh, why do you say that? Yeah, why why?

[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:36.960]
Well, because he doesn't get to me did anything except a non a not needed support

[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:40.980]
I mean, I like I say maybe I shouldn't say that but that's my true feeling now sir, you know

[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:45.180]
I'm right here. You can talk directly to me. You don't have to talk to me like standing's trying to boycott you

[01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:47.300]
Oh, he doesn't recognize you like red China

[01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:52.240]
No, I wouldn't go that far, but you know, I mean, I've no need I have no I've no I've no led him for a long time

[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:56.040]
He didn't he did did real well before you came along and I think you're more or less a detriment

[01:30:56.040 --> 01:31:03.200]
That's just like a dead drum in yeah, don't you think that's a little strong a word to use in that sentence? No

[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:08.420]
I'll tell you why because I've heard you try to do news and you can't pronounce half the stuff you try to

[01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:11.180]
But that would be Steve. Yeah, have a nice day. Okay

[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:16.240]
What does that talk about doing with you? Well Steve is a nice guy is very emotional and very high

[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:17.080]
You could tell

[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:21.560]
And he just gets all been out of shape about minutia. Yes

[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:29.500]
Now this man has parlayed himself into a nice career he sits here any cackels and he eats and gets paid pretty nicely now for it now

[01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:33.160]
And leave him alone. Maybe it's jealousy. That could be it

[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:37.140]
He would like to come in and cackel. Yeah, see everybody thinks they can do it

[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:44.380]
And Steve like I said is a good guy, but he's a little too nervous to cackel. Okay. He's got that nervous kind of quaggle in his voice jealousy

[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:50.800]
Okay, you get so emotional about these people why don't you just consider the source okay? Just the basket case

[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:57.480]
Very good. Okay, speak of the basket case. Let's go to high alia. Hello. Hi you guys doing great. I don't know what I got just doesn't leave

[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:03.640]
The bird alone are you you should have that thing on cake with the old lady you're struggling

[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:07.620]
Yeah, which every once in a while you know and then people come on like that you can you know

[01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:11.480]
Just what they need when they're struggling they need to bring out something so they bring that out

[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:12.960]
Yeah, he brought out something all right

[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:18.300]
Listen now does this mean now that that um maybe we'll get a few people back on

[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:24.080]
To come in and visit you like uh maybe Tony and Hank and come on and talk to you and uh Tom

[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:26.860]
I don't think Tony will be coming in because Tony works at magic now

[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:30.840]
So I don't think that he'll be coming in here. I would like to but I really kind of down it

[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:36.020]
But the Hank can come in anytime. Hank's a good friend and a great guy. It's spider what Steve says and

[01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:41.320]
And by the way Bill Cosford I should thank Bill wrote a really nice piece in the hero yesterday a big article

[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:45.840]
You didn't see it. No, I didn't. Oh, he wrote a great article about talk radio mostly about me

[01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:49.440]
What's that now?

[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.760]
Now that the news is gonna go deep six. They don't care

[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:57.280]
That's the same that that paper is going out too. Yep. That's true. Harold's got it all locked up now

[01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.120]
Like the sex and filth and guts

[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:04.640]
Yeah, Paul Harvey by the way, I'm sure that there are a lot of people ringing the switchboard right now

[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:05.800]
Where's Paul?

[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:07.660]
All in harm. You were so upset

[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:12.420]
Paul went by by okay. He took his 18th century right wing

[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:17.080]
Propaganda went by by and he's not on w. I. O. D anymore and that's the way it goes, okay

[01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:25.100]
We don't have time on this show for Paul Harvey, okay? You know, he used to he used to disrespect Jimmy Carter so much that he was but when

[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:29.020]
Regan's on I mean, you know, all of a sudden you can't say anything bad about the president

[01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:34.320]
Yeah, well Paul is a right wing douchebag and he like manipulates the news, you know accordingly and but he's gone

[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:40.560]
And all those the sandy patent listeners who twisted over to hear Paul go back over to w's news and take you know have a nice life

[01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:43.900]
Is standing is right out the baby yet?

[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:45.620]
Any day. Oh wow

[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:49.540]
You keep us in touch and let us know what they're doing okay, and matter of fact they're gonna be filming

[01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:50.980]
It's a live part five

[01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:54.840]
So sexative it's just a joke

[01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:00.920]
No, it's just a little joke. They're doing just fine and it's gonna be a boy and his name is gonna be Christopher

[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.040]
Something or other but it's gonna be great

[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:09.560]
Listen, you have to and we hope it doesn't look like Stan you have to hang around and and have a little talk with the gackie

[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.960]
Because a gym man the tea he said yesterday

[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:15.980]
Then he takes it all in stride and and he doesn't let much of that stuff bother him

[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:18.500]
But since Joe is still young in the business and everything

[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:21.320]
His skin hasn't tough enough. Yeah, it goes a little sensitive

[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:25.540]
But in fact he was suicidal he was here yesterday when I was taping and he was watching the dolphin game

[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:27.440]
And he was a semi-suicidal

[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:30.840]
I met Manditch he's an ice guy he looks like he's in good shape

[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:33.500]
It looks like he could play tomorrow. Yeah, you should go out in

[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:38.360]
All the way out the little anorexic everybody around here is pretty good, you know, okay? Listen have a great day

1229 at wiod and our first day is going so well and this is like a piece of cake

[01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:56.720]
As they say on the table it's like a piece of

[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:01.020]
That could we say the wonderful island dreams are we gonna say that?

[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:03.420]
Mm-hmm, you can't get a real surly when you say that. Do they really?

[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:08.460]
Okay, but if you say the wonderful island of Dung like we used to say that with someone else then they say hey

[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:13.460]
That's more like it or the mint the mint. Yeah, they like that. See that's when we used to be someplace else

[01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:21.600]
Now that we're here. It's like hey, it's great. Okay, let's go to Delray. Hello. Hi Neil. Yes, sir. How are you? Great. Welcome to AM. Yeah

[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:34.500]

[01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:55.420]
Okay, she's over it, but I mean

[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:04.320]
Thank God

[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:08.460]
Thanks a lot bye bye. Well, that was a mollussel

[01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:09.700]
Wow

[01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:17.260]
Okay, let's go to Palm Beach again. Shall we West Palm? We're taking those seems are we taking all calls from Palm Beach County?

[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:22.980]
It's incredible. Sorry on Beach hello. Neil how you doing great first time caller and they sound good too

[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:27.600]
The guy sounds like he's right in the building you and the bird are great Americans Neil are you sure you're not calling from Bill

[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:28.620]
Wise's officer

[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:34.000]
I'm not myself. I called in on a fake hate call figure you're giving up on the mobile calls

[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.820]
Fig and I get put on first and the guy didn't fall for it. No, huh

[01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:40.800]
They're a little too sharp in the other room for that sir. Yeah, I a couple things

[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:46.820]
That's great a weaver after 50 years on the rules committee and the least penalized team one year and all of the sudden the officials

[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:48.940]
Are bent over backwards to hurt the dolphins now?

[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:51.180]
Is that is that what Rick was crying?

[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:57.340]
He's saying if so panlize this year because the officials are bent over backwards not to give the dolphins a break because

[01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:00.840]
Shulas on the rules committee's been on the rules committee for years for crying

[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.780]
I want to they admit it there a bunch of steps down there

[01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:07.380]
But sir why don't you understand you know when you have to do those games when you have to you know

[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:09.460]
preside over like a debacle like yesterday

[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:13.740]
Yeah, you'd be upset too. You'd be like pulling off our guy's socks one after another, okay?

[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:18.140]
But the big question is is what's worth to play on the field of the play by playing the booth?

[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:20.620]
No, now you're gonna say that you know one thing

[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:24.160]
I've consistently said about Rick regardless of anything I've ever said he's one of the best

[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:25.520]
Well, he's not objective obviously

[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:29.320]
Who wants him to be objective when I support a team?

[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:32.820]
I mean like when I was a pirate span all those years and Bob Prince was you know

[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:37.780]
So he was his partisan as could be or like if you're a cubs fan Harry Carey is great because he's for the home team

[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:42.100]
But that list that little little sound buddy just did was really ridiculous very inconsistent

[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:45.440]
Well if you say so we didn't listen to it because we were in here. We're schmoozing okay?

[01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:49.220]
I tried to call whenever you say I'll go along with it just to make you happy

[01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:53.600]
I tried to call you Rick has dick skinny's been the suffering with these miserable teams the last few years now

[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:57.180]
It can handle it try to call you Friday when you and joker were trying to figure out why

[01:37:57.180 --> 01:38:03.440]
Kane hangs around with the a cretin that he does outside of work because Kane obviously is a pretty sharp guy is a good talk show host

[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:05.280]
I think it all wait a minute wait a minute

[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:08.380]
Why is somebody who's a good talk show host a pretty sharp guy?

[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:12.840]
I just I'm not knocking Steve, but what makes you assume that because somebody's good on the year there is sharp guy

[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:14.200]
He may be a slow-mozzled sir

[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:17.580]
Well, you know, he may be some kind of a schmendrick who hangs around with a bunch of douchebags

[01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:22.260]
He may all I can base my opinion out of what I hear on the air and the air he sounds like he's pretty sharp

[01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:25.880]
Got a good personality's quick and I agree with him to some degree

[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:30.120]
But his philosophy seems to change and I think that the answer to him hanging around with

[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:35.700]
Mr. Ciderman is he doesn't care what's cider man boy. That's a mystery or do you sir? Yes?

[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:39.920]
Yeah, that's loose. I definitely lose wrong wrong phrase their cider man in general

[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:45.980]
I don't think he cares what philosophy somebody has as long as they help him with his stick in his bank account

[01:38:45.980 --> 01:38:49.720]
I'm not like that if somebody to me is a virulent right wing douchebag

[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:54.440]
I'm just not gonna hang around with that person because it just it just cuts across my grain

[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:58.700]
You know what I'm saying obviously it takes more than buying you a drink to get you go another table and change your

[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:00.640]
Flies right now a good meal. Maybe that's another

[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:06.140]
Sure and also the people that I've heard that you seem that behind his friends like mr. Hill there and Dave

[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:11.860]
Captain David the other station you are far better off with the individuals you hang around with away from the microphone

[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:16.200]
Well, I have a rich full-life unlike Steve who has this his show is this whole life sir

[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.920]
It's just a little joke. It's about that promo that he did

[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:24.860]
You're following me sir. I'm gonna draw you a diagram. Okay. Listen have a wonderful day to get it out of your system

[01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:28.660]
Keep up the good work because Rick weaver is pounding on the window and saying your number one

[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:31.240]
Well weaver the weatherman these are a place. Okay, good luck

[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:34.440]
Hostel and hysterical sure why

[01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:37.540]
Okay, I should give the numbers out the phones a big go nuts

[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:42.060]
But I know we have a lot of young pinheads out there who want to call through who are old AMListers and they're just at a loss

[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:47.660]
They have no idea what's going on and it makes two of us a date County 751 WIOD

[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:55.080]
Broward 524 WIOD Bokeh and Delray 278 WIOD and given these numbers out in the room and in Palm Beach

[01:39:55.080 --> 01:40:00.840]
655 WIOD 1234 and April Wortham is back with a quick WIOD news update

[01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:12.320]
Do you know we're up to our long distance dedication and this one is about kids and pets and the situation that we can all

[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:18.760]
Understand whether we have kids or pets or neither it's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio and here's what he likes

[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:23.020]
Dear Casey this may seem to be a strange dedication request

[01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:26.440]
But I'm quite sincere and it'll meet a lot if you play it

[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:34.480]
Recently there was a death in our family. He was a little dog named snuckles, but he was most certainly a part of us come start again

[01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:38.260]
From coming out of the record play the record, okay

[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:40.040]
Please

[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:49.080]
See when you come out of those up-tempo damn numbers man is impossible to make those transitions

[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:53.520]
And then you got to go into somebody dying, you know, they do this to me all the time

[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:57.220]
I don't know what the hell they do it for but damn it if we can't come out of a slow record

[01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:59.480]
I don't understand it is down on the phone

[01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:04.260]
Okay, I want a damn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a

[01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:08.220]
Up-tempo record every time I do a damn death dedication

[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:14.140]
Now make it and I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week

[01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:20.800]
It's a god last damn time. I want somebody use this in brain to not come out of a damn record

[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:25.660]
That is that's up-tempo and I got to talk about a control dying

[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:32.320]
What is this and ponderous man ponderous and ponderous why you can say that again

[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:37.500]
Okay, 19 to 1 W I O D the near Rogers Monday show and everything is just zip it right along

[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:39.480]
This has been too easy hasn't it?

[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:45.040]
Okay, don't forget sports talk at 610 tonight live from Tony Romans in Davy really

[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.200]
Boy you're gonna have to have some guts to go to

[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:52.360]
That dolphins gaming yesterday with the Rick weaver and Joe Zagaki and then at 8 o'clock tonight

[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:57.040]
Rush Lindbawd times night of a ten and Larry King what's a question at 11 o'clock tonight?

[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:02.860]
Okay, let's continue. Let's go back to Miami. Hello, and they'll yeah, yeah

[01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:07.220]
I'm like you know what you mean when you used to always say how Rick weaver never takes a shower

[01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:10.300]
I know I never said he never took a shower. I

[01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:13.740]
Said that there was something about his feet. I'm not sure exactly what it was

[01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:20.380]
But I said that the little tap dance after some of the games and that as a result some of his feet were like

[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:24.980]
What do they call that eczema or something? I don't know something like that sir

[01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:30.900]
Don't you understand we have to be nice to these people now we can't come over here and talk about the Rick's feet

[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:32.120]
My

[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:38.360]
Really pick is no absolutely now that one I'm not gonna back away. I mean when his main topic that it was the mystery picker

[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:40.040]
What does that tell you okay?

[01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:42.340]
Okay, I want one other thing

[01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:47.080]
I like Greta lot but like he never talks and when he does you never

[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:50.360]
He just says a couple words. That's the idea

[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:54.780]
Yeah, and then you talk very spiritually. That's the idea of a problem with that sir

[01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:58.780]
Well, I don't understand you know the state the station could save like five six hundred a week

[01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:01.540]
How do you now wait about how do you know he's making five six hundred a week?

[01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:04.900]
He could be making more than that or less. Yeah, brother. Are you jealous?

[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:06.960]
Or would you like to get paid by the cackel?

[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:12.700]
But he doesn't even answer the phone. He doesn't do anything. He does nothing exactly and that's the way he likes it. Okay?

[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:16.840]
We can't you know this is not way to come back

[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:23.580]
Okay, what's that because there's food in here? You missed the pizza to Steve and the ribs from Tony Romas

[01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:28.500]
That's right. That'll see some cookies from mother-rims cookies here and there's all the good stuff for meats and treats

[01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:31.120]
Yeah, see we don't mess around

[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:33.880]
But watch him though because he's got to watch his weight

[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:39.500]
He's gotten just a little on the puffy sides of my soul. Yeah, I wouldn't say fat, but he's got a

[01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:40.840]
Puffy I like you know

[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:44.220]
No, well you gained in lost I know when you get to be as old as you are

[01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:48.740]
In fact, I don't know anybody as old as you are and the cookies are right here. Do you like some of those like a cookie?

[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:50.240]
Those are an amcentum

[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:56.460]
Now these are delicious and you missed the ribs, but they disappeared like Grant took old just they just put them down in the cafeteria

[01:43:56.460 --> 01:43:57.800]
And they just swooped him up

[01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:03.980]
Until Wednesday night and I didn't have saved my appetite. Yeah, by the way, it's Glenn invited to that too

[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:11.280]
Wow who else gonna be there Tom jicca you me and Steve okay at the depot we're gonna meet at the depot seven o'clock

[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:13.680]
Okay, I'll do any audience can come watch a seat

[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:19.420]
If you move quickly and it is good stuff see we'll feed you now Steve

[01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:22.680]
I like customers pal. This isn't like yeah, Cosford had a great column

[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:27.460]
The knee always does thank God for Bill like we're gonna have him on the show one of these days if he ever comes back to town

[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:34.980]
He did oh, yeah that little part about how he's become very comfortable with any subject and what the hell is that all about?

[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:37.220]
Well, I would speculate but yeah

[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.900]
Perhaps we better pass on that although maybe when you have Jack Sturdy on in a few days he can answer the question for you

[01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:45.800]
I can't answer all questions. Oh, do you really have a couple of them?

[01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:51.260]
Okay 1244 it's 16 no one air steam. He's getting ready for his contrive debate today at two

[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:56.220]
And let's go to Kendall night showing. Well, I'm finally getting the hang of this thing on a phone great

[01:44:57.060 --> 01:45:03.020]
Finally took a little while I'm a little slow, but the sooner or later. Okay Kendall. Hello. Oh my god. Yes, sir

[01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:06.900]
I'm on the air these phones sound so damn good, you know it?

[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:12.140]
God better you sound better on the end than you did on FM. Yeah FM was really a loser wasn't it?

[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:17.860]
We had big numbers, but we just didn't have the right audience for the management over there and we're getting up early in the morning, huh?

[01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:19.820]
Yes, some lightweight airwaves. Yeah

[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:27.560]
Couple things I tried like like hell when you're on FM to get through to you to ask you a question. Okay. What's the question, sir?

[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:31.780]
The question was I was I guess probably about a month ago all of a sudden

[01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:38.380]
Cable was playing over and over again this movie about explorers and these kids and river Phoenix. Oh

[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:44.160]
Forget it. Well the question that I had was and it's an old question already, but it's still probably

[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:50.880]
Qualifies as a decent one. What was all the talk prior to that all last year?

[01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:54.920]
Or would have you the summer about this guy River Phoenix?

[01:45:55.580 --> 01:45:58.420]
Wait a minute. What was all the talk by who you didn't hear me talk about him?

[01:45:58.980 --> 01:45:59.100]
I

[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:03.520]
Lenn was the one who was talking about him constantly. He's got like a river. He thinks river Phoenix

[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:08.120]
I guess looks like a girl. Okay, that must be it. Now you guys are all

[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:09.560]
He's got this female

[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:14.840]
He's very big in the Phoebe Kates and I think he thinks that somewhere along the line the two of them are like related

[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:17.700]
Like you don't seem in the same room. They must be the same. That is correct

[01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:22.060]
In fact, if you strip them both stark naked of all their clothing there'd be a lot of similar body parts

[01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:25.400]
I think I think we were talking about his name river and

[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:31.660]
No, no, there were some people who had in fact back when we were on AM you had this thing about river Phoenix

[01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:35.900]
Constantly and we kept playing stand by me, which I'm gonna have to put on cart

[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:40.380]
River Phoenix it was Jeff Striker. I mean, well now you're getting a little anonymous

[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:42.540]
Yeah, now you're getting a little bit closer to the truth in fact

[01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:44.880]
Striker's gonna be on with Steve one of these days soon

[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:48.760]
And I might just hang around for 20 or 30 minutes. See what's going on

[01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:52.880]
Listen when you when you went to FM

[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:59.340]
In fact, I think when you were still at AM before you went to FM you lost or it was taken from you

[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:04.100]
If I had a peanut. Oh, yeah, we're getting Uncle Bonzai

[01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:07.580]
No, not if I had a penis it's called penis envy

[01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:09.760]
I mean the way you say that sir

[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:13.780]
It sounds so you know debasing and disgusting. It's like something river Phoenix would say

[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:16.200]
In the

[01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:20.320]
No, no uncle Bonzai was that the guy?

[01:47:20.420 --> 01:47:25.780]
Yeah, the boat doctor. Yeah, he's sending it to us or bringing it by or putting it on a boat and sending it down the intercoastal

[01:47:25.780 --> 01:47:27.960]
Or something and in a couple of days we'll have it

[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:33.220]
Well Jerry floats around all the counties you can probably have a lot of listeners who float around all the counties

[01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:37.040]
Okay, if you know what I mean probably expect in the drop in with that album, but that's great

[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:41.280]
Yeah, you have that cut on card now or no, you lost it. Are you listening to me?

[01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:44.000]
So that's what we're waiting we need boys want sex in the morning

[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.160]
penis envy and one other one on there that we used to play which I can't think of at the moment

[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:52.520]
But when he brings him in we'll dub him fantastic get on a stick Jerry

[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:56.440]
Okay, okay, sir. Thank you for the inside call and have a wonderful day

[01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:58.900]
Thank you. Bye. Bye. Who now was that?

[01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:02.840]
No idea good guy, but I mean they sounded like a little in to me

[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:04.280]
Wilton manners hello

[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.380]
You're on the same station as Jimmy Johnson. Do you still think he looks like how he duty on a bad day?

[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:13.560]
Yeah, you are you sexually attracted to him now neither one sir. Is this mr. Bluster?

[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:15.260]
No, okay

[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:20.820]
I think that was his second call if I'm not mistaken. Of course he looks like how he duty on a bad day

[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:22.700]
And I wish he'd get we're get a new wig, okay?

[01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:28.240]
Come on. It's to one W I O D and our next call is in Miami. Hello. I knew yes, sir

[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:31.140]
Great to see you on the new station. Well good. It's good to see you too

[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:39.720]
In fact, as I look through the speaker I can almost get the feeling I could reach out and touch you. Yeah, you wish yeah

[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:46.860]
Maybe I think you would okay. Well, it sounds pretty interesting sir. How long would you like to talk about a half an hour?

[01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:53.500]
Well, I don't know maybe maybe you want to spend a half hour just right here. Okay, whatever you say pal listen

[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:56.180]
one of the boats in time to

[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.940]
Talking about what happened last year, you know with that clown and roll gables

[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:08.200]
Oh, no, we can't to discuss anything even remotely related to that okay, sir. No, or do we want nor do we have any desire to?

[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:10.660]
Okay, I just was wondering

[01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:16.860]
Okay, the day will come someday wait on the road, but not now already. There's an interesting article in the Sunday

[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:19.440]
Hurl the local section

[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:23.880]
Concerning that clown I saw it, but like I said sir. We can't discuss it

[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:28.520]
I like to do a little experiment. How long's your time to line seven seconds? Yeah, okay?

[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:31.120]
I like to be the first person to introduce you. Okay. Have a nice day

[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:32.220]
I

[01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:38.720]
Mean is it worth it? You know is it worth objecting myself to it?

[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:45.120]
Some people are so easily amused incredible. Okay 1249 it's 11 before 1 and W I O D

[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.560]
And we're gonna do the melting pot now because I just can't wait good

[01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:53.300]
And those of you see we have a whole new opportunity to turn people on to the great fund do it

[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:56.540]
The melting pot because we have a whole I don't want to say a whole new audience

[01:49:56.540 --> 01:50:00.660]
Because a lot of these people are like carry-overs from other places gone by

[01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:03.760]
But I'm guarantee we have a lot of people who never even heard of the melting pot

[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:05.560]
They have three locations. They're in West Palm

[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:10.840]
They're on sunset drive down in South Miami and they're on sample road in Oral Springs and when it comes to fondue

[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:14.780]
You can't touch the melting pot fact and not only just fondue

[01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:15.940]
But when it comes to having a good

[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:22.120]
Relaxing enjoyable dinner with friends having maybe a nice bottle of wine great service very moderate prices

[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:27.420]
Nice atmosphere than the melting pot is the place any night seven nights of the week beginning at five o'clock

[01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:34.460]
4 30 on Sunday down in Kendall and whether you choose the cheese of the a cheddar cheese or a Swiss cheese fondue or the beef

[01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:40.920]
Chicken seafood or vegetarian main course or the white chocolate with amaretto or chocolate fondue dessert the food is always

[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:44.520]
Sensational it's kind of fun because you cook it right at your own table and as I said

[01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:47.940]
It's always a real treat at the melting pot. You tried once you're gonna be hooked

[01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:52.620]
You go back time and time again you'll find them at 3044 South military trail in West Palm

[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:56.780]
9835 Sunset driving South Miami just up the road from the bird's house

[01:50:56.780 --> 01:51:00.360]
And on West sample road in Coral Springs just to my West University

[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:06.940]
Just a couple of blocks east of Pine Island Road. You tell them Uncle Neil sent you by for fantastic fondue the melting pot

[01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:08.940]
Here's a tip for travelers

[01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:12.580]
Now you can earn money every time you fly

[01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:14.420]
Red a car

[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:20.320]
Bob Silver Henry Barrow all part of South Florida's morning show every week day right here

[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:25.620]
Now back to Neil Rogers our new stock radio six 10 W I O D

[01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:32.000]
This is the most disgusting program. I urge everyone to complain to this station

[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:37.220]
Okay, it's 1253 at W I O D the near-roger show Steve is in the building. He'll be a logger too

[01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:42.000]
Wow, I know you're excited about that and let's take our next call from Hollywood. Hello

[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.200]
Well, Neil. Yes, sir. I have a question for you and then a question for the bird. Okay

[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:54.000]
I first I want to say happy birthday. Thank you. Thanks. And I know Sally fits very nicely that did she blow out your candles?

[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:57.940]
Next question sir. Okay

[01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:02.020]
Because it's my birthday she can certainly blow mine, but anyway

[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:03.640]
Candles

[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:05.020]
Yep

[01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:11.920]
Okay, bird. Yes, sir. You probably didn't know this all that time. I'm one of the people that listen to what

[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:14.420]
When Zeta, but I never really called in

[01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:15.320]
I'm on where

[01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:20.080]
Unzeta four. Oh, yeah, I remember that. Yeah, some FM

[01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:26.380]
And you guys were some about Joey as one of the major competitors or something like that

[01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:28.660]
Yeah, you gave him a lot of fear of time

[01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:34.180]
But actually the way I thought your main competitor was some guy called Zippo in the morning

[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:40.480]
Zippo. Yeah, I don't understand. There was like there's a guy on

[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:48.000]
AM 1290 AM they called Zippo in the morning. I used to switch 1290 AM. What is that? What the hell is that?

[01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:51.480]
WPP whatever yeah, WPP

[01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:56.840]
The big PPP on your radio. Yeah, Palm Beach Gold. Oh

[01:52:57.500 --> 01:52:58.420]
That's a heavyweight

[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:05.920]
Where's this guy calling from anyway? They played some real classic. Are you in Jupiter, sir? No, I think he's on your rain

[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:06.400]
Okay

[01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:12.060]
1255 on WIOD. Well, that was an incredible compliment. I'm Zippo

[01:53:12.060 --> 01:53:13.440]
Analyzing that in my mind

[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:20.380]
Volca. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey Neil. How you doing? I feel like I'm an old friend of yours who listen so long

[01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:23.980]
Well, it sounds like you're getting older by the minute pal. Really waiting on the line all this time

[01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:28.580]
That'll do it. Yeah, I have a question for you. How can I come to pompin at this year?

[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:32.720]
I'll come on. I'm coming to pompin. Oh because they didn't buy my show again

[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:35.240]
They may sound petty, but it's like two of the last three years

[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:38.480]
When I was still over on Zeta we had the number one show in the morning

[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:44.380]
We had the best demographics by far of anybody and they play politics over there with their advertising and as a result

[01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:49.060]
I just made up my mind. I don't need them. Okay, and now I'm just don't need them opening night

[01:53:49.060 --> 01:53:51.740]
We looked where we heard you had a reservation around yeah, I did

[01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:54.340]
That's right. I wouldn't I discovered what the politics were going on

[01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:57.000]
I said the hell with them and that's the way I feel

[01:53:57.380 --> 01:54:02.700]
It's still fun track. Well great. I mean, I'm looking and they're getting like 2200 people on a weeknight and 2400

[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:09.780]
They can't afford to alienate their friends, you know, but the problem over there is they have never learned who their real friends are and

[01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:14.340]
They're gonna pay for it. Okay. I don't get me wrong. I love harness racing and it's a great

[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:20.160]
I feel it's a great sacrifice that I might because I'd love to go there a couple of times a week, but um, I don't need them

[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:24.580]
I can use that money for better purposes. Okay, kind of stuff that's right in there now

[01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:29.620]
You don't miss anything anyhow. Yeah, you know, there's three 40 and 280 and 260 who needs that? Okay

[01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:32.900]
We've got three dolphins tickets. They're one the shows off. There you go

[01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:38.300]
Get them guys at the office now least we fill up the stadium, right? Yeah, one more thing. I was looking to cap and Dave this morning. Yeah

[01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:40.200]
But it's sad it's all over there

[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:42.720]
Mm-hmm. Now you left him stranded. Yeah

[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:46.840]
You know, you know what to do when they're kind of in limbo and it's uh, you know

[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:48.720]
People you're intended we were gonna be there

[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:52.980]
We'd probably still be on the air over there at least through this week if things would have kind of goring to oil but

[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:57.080]
The upper level management again not to mention any specific names to him

[01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:02.580]
But the upper level management had a blurted out to the newspapers and put it out in public and as a result

[01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:08.520]
We just you know, we just all decided to be better to go our separate ways a little bit sooner, but um, I don't know what they're gonna do

[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:10.920]
I really don't ever think it would bring Captain Dave ever with it

[01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:16.460]
Well, you know, it's hard enough to get two people hired but to get a station to hire three is pretty tough

[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:20.820]
Especially for a midday show you know, but if we had been on in the morning again somewhere would have been different

[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:23.780]
Because you know, three people are really takes to do a morning show

[01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:28.120]
But to do a midday show pretty hard to sell that and they always doesn't talk about you guys well if Neil

[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:32.860]
We're here he'd be doing this yeah, okay, really yeah, if Neil were there he'd be pulling his hair out okay

[01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:37.000]
You have no idea when I tell you I tell people it's like being let off death row

[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:40.440]
And I mean it I'm not kidding. That's how badly they treated us

[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:46.760]
That's how they made us feel like subhuman a garbage and he just never stopped harassing and pulling bits out and uh

[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:50.880]
Don't do that. It's about pop up. You know, and blaming us for the failures of the rest of the day

[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:56.760]
Which to me is incredible yeah, but to bring me in and sit me down and say well you got to be more positive about the rest of the day

[01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:59.920]
And I said to them I said look I could pay each one of my listeners

[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:04.080]
50 bucks of peace and if they don't like the music you're playing the rest of the day

[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:06.080]
They're not going to listen to it okay

[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:09.640]
So instead of looking at themselves and a lot of that obscure

[01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:15.380]
Marginal non-entity music that they seem insistent upon playing and saying maybe we need to change that

[01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:20.360]
They kept pointing the finger at us while you're not you know not selling the rest of the day. Well who the hell could sell it?

[01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:27.240]
Well, you think the numbers then they should leave the loan. Yeah, well good luck to them. Okay. All right. I could talk and take it on. They're gonna get there

[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:29.000]
Okay, thanks a lot. Bye-bye

[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:33.060]
Well, these people sound like they're on a really emotional trip here today, don't they?

[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:36.100]
Okay, speaking of elderly let's go to Lake Worth. Hello

[01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:37.640]
Lake Worth

[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:42.300]
Okay

[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:55.800]
She must be related to the struggling lady. Okay. Uh-huh. It must have been Rick Siderman's grandmother

[01:56:57.340 --> 01:57:00.160]
Boy, are we gonna have to hear about Rick Siderman for the next the god?

[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:05.900]

The mentored things from your brain. Okay, they just reach in there and they lift them right out. We got our work cut out for

[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:15.660]

Up for it, but you left out fat see if you should have said you're my favorite fat

[01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:21.620]

Just any old fag, okay, you miserable bitch

[01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:30.560]
Okay, listen, that's about it for this hour. We got only one hour to go. Can you believe this?

[01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:35.520]
We just sat down here and the food came in and everybody's in a great mood and Rick changed his socks and everything

[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:38.520]
It's incredible and who is the mystery picker by the way

[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:42.520]
Steve has done the identity of the mystery picker on the cane show this afternoon

[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:48.200]

Listen uh glam neo by the way neo-heavy birthday. Thank you. Graduation from locations. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I was right by there 10 o'clock. I realized I saw the

[01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:18.780]
The things they have the barricades on every nice chic cosy. Yeah, I think that's my business

[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:20.860]
I'd be of a thousand points of light

[01:59:20.860 --> 01:59:28.760]
I really like that though. By the way, I have a version copy of Uncle Bonza. You may use it if you want are you serious?

[01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:31.740]
I swear to God if I played her one time really

[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:36.360]
Not all the cuts. I will bring it by tomorrow if you really want excellent. That's fantastic unless you've already got it on

[01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:38.320]
If it's already being sent then we'll bring it well

[01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:41.060]
No, if you come by first believe me it'll that'll be great

[01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:43.440]
We can have some people dub it while we're on the air okay

[01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:46.900]
I know a lot of people just like the other place. They got people walking up and down the hallway

[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:49.700]
Who are doing nothing? You know, we don't know who they are. Hey

[01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:53.420]
I realize this isn't like 200 seven drive, you know

[01:59:53.420 --> 01:59:57.620]
Probably can hardly look so out like worse than 200 seven drive. Hey, let me tell you it's great over here

[01:59:57.620 --> 02:00:01.460]
This is like there's some real living and breathing people here and a few of me even speak English

[02:00:03.060 --> 02:00:08.840]
Everyone's putting you down about with Rick Weaver. I have to say I've listened to Neil since he was on AM and he has stationed

[02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:12.760]
If I'm a voice followed you you've always played this consistency

[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:17.840]
You've always caught attention to fact that he never changes. He's a great announcer. There no question about it

[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:22.600]
I mean far as he's socks or whatever that's another story. What is a great announcer? Absolutely

[02:00:23.420 --> 02:00:26.180]
But I do have something to tell you that you might not like

[02:00:26.700 --> 02:00:27.040]
Uh-oh

[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:30.840]
Okay, I'm Saturday night live. I saw more than Downey Jr

[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:34.560]
Yeah, okay, he was with the church. It's a true story. I'm Saturday night

[02:00:35.340 --> 02:00:41.060]
He was trying to river for being you know how crimp and proper she is and he was saying what she really needed was more

[02:00:41.060 --> 02:00:45.020]
Downey junior junior and he pointed to his crotch and that's for real. I'm not making this up

[02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:49.320]
Are you serious? He said junior junior once again, they've ripped off your lining. Yeah, that board man

[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:51.480]
He just doesn't have an original thought is not does he?

[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:55.660]
And also at the same night I watched the jack Anderson special on the JFK assassination

[02:00:56.280 --> 02:01:01.600]
And I finally put on my glad you mentioned that man that was now glenets mentioned he saw it on

[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:06.040]
It was grass week. Yeah, yeah, it wasn't great. It was horrendous man

[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:09.940]
It was the worst piece of crap. I've ever seen it was like that UFO show with Mike Ferrell

[02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:13.760]
That's right amateur and they had Marina Oswald on there all of these

[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:17.180]
These independent shows that they're putting together, man. It's incredible

[02:01:17.180 --> 02:01:20.560]
But the information was good. It was just it was hot pie together for the

[02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:28.740]
I want when you calm down listen to me Johnny Roselle died in 1976. He got hit. Okay. That's 12 years ago

[02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:31.980]
Now if he gave all this information to jack Anderson before he died

[02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:37.380]
How come it took jack 12 years to make these great revelations because Johnny Roselle just surface so to speak

[02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:43.760]
What you just surface, you know the old drum meal. Yeah, the body just came up. Oh, I got you. Okay

[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:48.560]
Now but seriously I put it together when Dan Quill compared himself to JFK

[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:54.640]
He wasn't that far off base because at this point time nobody knows the whereabouts of either of their brain. Yeah, okay

[02:01:55.340 --> 02:01:58.700]
Okay, throat thanks a lot. I have a wonderful day and thanks for the record in advance

[02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:02.400]
Bye-bye now. I told you I thought that was a weird show terrible

[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:07.400]
But there were a couple things I did learn from it was awful and anybody who has I mean this doesn't include you

[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:10.220]
But anybody who's been a student of the JFK assassination

[02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:15.440]
You know didn't learn anything from that show. I mean, that's all old material right. I'm not a student

[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:18.920]
No, interested that I have you're not I haven't studied it

[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:23.840]
But like on the edges on the fringes something like that was pathetic

[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:30.460]
And then at the end of the show there is they were going out and they showed all these pictures of a JFK running around in his bathing suit

[02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:36.200]
And in his gym shorts. What was that supposed to be was that kind of like the beginning of a JFK skin flicker something?

[02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:36.880]
Oh, Zanaba

[02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:44.040]
That'll probably be coming up next month with jacket and the way jack delivered that show the way he read the lines in it

[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:49.660]
It was so pathetic, you know, it's real. Come on jack. It was like he was doing his an imitation of his old boss drew Pearson

[02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:51.980]
Wow, you don't remember drew Pearson

[02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:56.440]
Before I waited away before he was like Jack Anderson's boss really well

[02:02:56.440 --> 02:03:01.180]
Anderson was kind of shaking. Yeah, he was shaking and if I'd been doing it kind of a show I'd have been shaken too

[02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:03.180]
Okay, let's go to Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:08.480]
Nobody there. What a shame. I know that must probably been one of the best calls of the day

[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:11.600]
Got a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hi Neil. How are you great?

[02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:16.060]
Sirious question. Are you going to do it any sports announcing now that you're on i.o.d?

[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:20.320]
I don't know but if I would answer yes, I'm sure there'll be a lot of historical people in the building

[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:24.660]
But let's put it this way the possibility is open. Okay, would you like to do it? Yes

[02:03:24.660 --> 02:03:29.320]
Because you know, I don't know you know, one of your new new listeners don't know how good you are at this stuff

[02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:32.740]
Well, probably they don't but they will and secondly real quick. We'll tell them

[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:37.960]
I read almost every book you can read on the JFK thing when it first happened on the left and you're absolutely right

[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:45.140]
There's nothing new everybody has thought for years. It was the Cuban slash mafia. There's not I mean it was it was one of the most boring shows

[02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:47.360]
I ever saw yeah, and he did have David Shimon

[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:50.200]
I don't know if you read that book or not the one that I've been touting. Oh, yeah

[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:51.760]
What's the name of that book?

[02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:58.540]
Contracts contract on America. Yeah, the mafia assassination of JFK is the subheading

[02:03:58.540 --> 02:04:03.820]
Is that a new book? Yeah, it's within the last year or so. I haven't read that. Try read everything 10 years ago

[02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:06.140]
The book is sensational. Okay, it's excellent

[02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:08.740]
And he did have David Shimon you author on a couple of times

[02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:12.120]
But other than that man, there was nothing new on there the interview with Marina

[02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:16.720]
I think even a five-year-old kid could have done a better interview with Marina Oswald. It was pathetic

[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:21.340]
It really was and if you read everything like I had right after happened

[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:24.720]
Then you knew how pathetic the Warren commission report was. Yeah. Oh, yeah

[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:30.140]
The series that been coming out for years is like you say there's nothing new. It's like it's like it's tomato soup

[02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:33.240]
How did you like you made us do? How did you like Jerry Ford's performance?

[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:38.460]
But he's a bright guy isn't he? I didn't like the I didn't like the use

[02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:42.400]
I know it's hard to do I don't like the use of the the quote actors to take the place of all these

[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:44.860]
I mean it was amateurish. You were terrible. You're right

[02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:49.220]
I'd like to see you do some sports announcing because you're the best baseball announcer I ever heard. Thank you, sir

[02:04:49.220 --> 02:04:51.640]
You're a great American. Thanks a lot

[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:54.920]
This has been a real innovating day hasn't it?

[02:04:55.400 --> 02:05:01.720]
Now they did take the razor plate that at the sports department. Yeah, they did take the razor blades on a both the sports department and this studio

[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:05.680]
Just before uh before we came on the air. I think there's something symbolic about that

[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:09.280]
Anyways 12 minutes after one at 610 W. I. O. D. We'll come right back

[02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:12.440]

Okay 122 at WIOD

[02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:41.730]
Then he around your show here on a Monday and just all kinds of people out there wanted to hear that yeah and there was

[02:15:42.310 --> 02:15:47.330]
What I say all kinds of people I mean lots of people was that nothing appropriate to them all kinds of people

[02:15:48.310 --> 02:15:52.710]
Anyway, I just I want to make a little announcement because I want to get something out of my system right in the beginning

[02:15:52.710 --> 02:15:59.650]
Okay, and that is like we heard from musty from Hollywood who's a nice guy but a chronic caller and I just want to let this audience

[02:15:59.650 --> 02:16:04.130]
No, because I know we got a lot of WIOD people a lot of new people and a lot of people from whatever

[02:16:04.750 --> 02:16:06.690]
And that's not what the show is gonna be okay

[02:16:06.690 --> 02:16:10.750]
This is not gonna be the magnificent seven. It's not gonna be the same old chronic voices

[02:16:10.750 --> 02:16:14.570]
It's not gonna be people over the age of a hundred. It's not gonna be how loud

[02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:22.010]
Don't want that okay, don't you understand we don't want it. Yeah, but what if jack and the beach calls lovely lady

[02:16:22.630 --> 02:16:24.070]
Hello lovely lady

[02:16:24.670 --> 02:16:33.050]
Now he's busy with Sandy okay and believe me. She's gonna need jack every single day okay trust me lovely lady

[02:16:34.770 --> 02:16:39.510]
But I just want to make that clear up front we don't on this show we don't encourage chronic regulars

[02:16:39.510 --> 02:16:42.930]
We don't want to hear all those old KAT voices from 15 years ago

[02:16:43.370 --> 02:16:50.130]
That's that's the death now of talk radio in this market okay and people like Sandy who are lazy who keep talking to the same

[02:16:50.130 --> 02:16:56.430]
And dozen people over and over again. That's why they're terminal okay to put it in very clear blood language terminal

[02:16:57.270 --> 02:17:00.490]
Now what are we gonna do the day myself clear? What are we gonna do the day?

[02:17:00.490 --> 02:17:02.210]
She has the TV repairman well

[02:17:02.210 --> 02:17:04.690]
We'll probably have to stay home that day because there's no way to combat that

[02:17:04.690 --> 02:17:09.630]
And the day that she's got the collectibles guy. No way to combat that

[02:17:10.370 --> 02:17:15.210]
Okay, let's do a little break and then we'll get back into these calls because they're passing out on the phone 124

Thank you sir. I want to congratulate you for being there and happy birthday. Thank you. I haven't listened to WIOD since big Wilson was on to tell you the truth

[02:19:54.310 --> 02:19:54.850]

[02:20:02.070 --> 02:20:07.430]
That's right. Listen. I want to just say that number one Glenn is okay but my book kind of anybody

[02:20:08.230 --> 02:20:10.050]
Everybody's knocking him down, but I don't know why yeah

[02:20:10.050 --> 02:20:11.890]
They don't like them. Let him go someplace else

[02:20:11.890 --> 02:20:16.450]
Okay, he's a part of the show. He's an important part of the show and the people are just still interesting

[02:20:16.450 --> 02:20:19.910]
You know and if they you know these people that just can't give up on that you know for years

[02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:23.950]
I've had that and I've been very successful and all of that stuff and they just keep

[02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:28.950]
They want to be the program director. They can't reframe themselves. Okay. That's true. That's true

[02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:34.490]
No, I think he's a very important part of the show. He's an important part of his show. I think you have to have two people there

[02:20:34.490 --> 02:20:35.430]
Really bad

[02:20:35.950 --> 02:20:41.270]
Anyway, I want to say that morning radio is terrible now. I don't know where to go until 10 o'clock

[02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:43.490]
I don't know if it's exciting. I can listen to you all day

[02:20:43.990 --> 02:20:48.930]
I mean it's it's blank and ponder trying to get some ponderous. Yeah, there are a lot of things that are ponderous

[02:20:49.650 --> 02:20:53.270]
Well, listen one thing more now. I'm way up here in Palm Beach and Riviera Beach

[02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:55.370]
You know and I can hardly get the signal

[02:20:55.870 --> 02:20:59.910]
Maybe we can get them to up it a little bit in Riviera Beach and really get WIOD

[02:20:59.910 --> 02:21:04.290]
Yeah, I don't know if it's the building. I mean a lot. It must be I think you're gonna have to move to another building

[02:21:04.290 --> 02:21:08.950]
I feel like I'm listening to new Armstrong from the moon. Yeah, could you get how did you get the Zada up there?

[02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:10.570]
Pretty pretty good

[02:21:10.930 --> 02:21:15.410]
You know, it came in a lot better but really not coming in anymore in my radio

[02:21:15.410 --> 02:21:21.150]
But then it's the building because we got a big huge signal now. Oh, yeah, this station got a monster signal, okay?

[02:21:21.390 --> 02:21:24.130]
Yeah, I know I know I know I struggle with fluorescent lights and all that

[02:21:24.130 --> 02:21:30.630]
We're loaded with them here. Anyway, I just want to say congratulations. Well wait a minute if you got or if you got like a electric radio plug in

[02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:34.590]
Yeah, I do well, so get yourself a battery radio and it'll probably come in better

[02:21:34.590 --> 02:21:39.350]
I'll get all that electrical interference. I'll try it. Okay. Keep up the good work. Thanks. Thanks a lot. All right. All right

[02:21:39.350 --> 02:21:43.130]
See that sounds good to probably not true because even battery operator radio is getting interference

[02:21:43.130 --> 02:21:47.790]
But that sounds good doesn't it? I've never heard that before. Yeah, I just made it up. Yeah, I know

[02:21:48.510 --> 02:21:51.870]
Okay, now wait a minute. Seven is Miami on the Bokeh line

[02:21:52.810 --> 02:21:57.870]
Is that correct boy somebody really desperate? Hello. Hi Neil. How you doing? I've been great. Thanks

[02:21:57.870 --> 02:22:02.930]
Well, I don't want to go into where I crawled on the Bokeh line. You mean you're calling long distance just to speak to us

[02:22:02.930 --> 02:22:07.290]
It's on the company farm. Oh, thank god. Thank god for somebody else's paying for it. Yeah

[02:22:07.970 --> 02:22:13.990]
I've got late. I just found out deep throat call that he had the Uncle Bond's album. Yeah, I was gonna drop off for a couple

[02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:16.930]
I sent you the original tape back when well. I sure

[02:22:16.930 --> 02:22:22.590]
We got a lot of mileage out of it. I came in and yanked out. I know I did good good stuff for anyway

[02:22:22.590 --> 02:22:23.770]
I have a lot of other

[02:22:23.770 --> 02:22:25.830]
What I think are interesting sounding music

[02:22:26.330 --> 02:22:32.410]
Some that I know you can't play in the air. I thought I dropped moss. Okay. Would that be all right? Some that we can't play. I know you can't play

[02:22:32.410 --> 02:22:36.770]
Oh, you familiar with Patrick's guys songs that made America famous no

[02:22:37.470 --> 02:22:43.390]
Great. Well, I can send over the whole album, but you run a cassettes or a real to real. Oh cassettes is a lot better

[02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:45.710]
Real to real is like pass a

[02:22:46.090 --> 02:22:52.310]
Is that right? Yeah, I mean not that we don't have some machines here, but it's pass a I sent you a long time ago

[02:22:52.310 --> 02:22:57.270]
I after you after you started playing Uncle Bond's I learned I started sending a couple more tapes

[02:22:57.270 --> 02:23:01.050]
But I guess I got lost in the shuffle. Yeah. Yeah. We had a lot of stuff that got lost in the shuffle

[02:23:01.050 --> 02:23:06.650]
All right, well good hearing you again. Okay. Thanks a lot. Okay, bye. Bye. Bye. Why isn't this amazing?

[02:23:06.770 --> 02:23:12.530]
The original Uncle Bond's like we're just picking up where we left off a year and a half ago on a.m. Kind of almost

[02:23:12.530 --> 02:23:15.110]
Yeah, like we're coming was it a year and a half or was it two years?

[02:23:15.810 --> 02:23:20.690]
It's been oh, it's two years a year since we started on a and you talk about it a year

[02:23:21.070 --> 02:23:23.170]
We were on fm for a year and two weeks

[02:23:24.010 --> 02:23:28.570]
That's that what you've done like a science. Well, I have incredible long-term memory now what happened yesterday

[02:23:28.570 --> 02:23:33.890]
I have no idea, but you know, I remember we were on fm for a year until we'll start saying the year again

[02:23:33.890 --> 02:23:37.050]
Let's just go to screw in the audience up. Okay. It's 134 can take a little

You're gonna take a beating

[02:25:10.570 --> 02:25:12.930]
Oh yeah, but you'll cut you down the spot

[02:25:15.570 --> 02:25:18.910]

[02:25:24.970 --> 02:25:25.690]
Oh

[02:25:28.770 --> 02:25:29.790]
My god

[02:25:30.650 --> 02:25:32.350]
You've been saved my information

[02:25:35.650 --> 02:25:38.890]
I'm actually doing my chest today on your permanent vacation

[02:25:43.250 --> 02:25:45.050]
I can see you coming

[02:25:46.030 --> 02:25:48.010]
You're gonna get your teeth and start running

[02:25:48.010 --> 02:25:51.430]
You're a big boy now, but it has you down the side

[02:25:54.730 --> 02:25:57.830]
It's like me, he has your gun, but all your hateful eyes

[02:26:01.230 --> 02:26:04.370]
My boyfriend back to the vista has a lot of trouble

[02:26:09.970 --> 02:26:11.290]
My boy, you're back

[02:26:11.290 --> 02:26:13.330]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[02:26:13.330 --> 02:26:14.430]

[02:26:14.430 --> 02:26:16.670]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[02:26:16.670 --> 02:26:17.690]

But I hate you

[02:26:22.830 --> 02:26:25.330]
I hate you, but I hate you

[02:26:26.770 --> 02:26:28.330]
You're gonna be come back

[02:26:28.330 --> 02:26:29.730]
I hate you

[02:26:29.730 --> 02:26:29.730]

[02:26:29.730 --> 02:26:30.050]
I hate you

[02:26:30.050 --> 02:26:31.270]
You're gonna be come back

[02:26:31.270 --> 02:26:31.270]

[02:26:31.270 --> 02:26:35.170]
But I hate you

[02:26:35.170 --> 02:26:36.030]
Like you and me

[02:26:37.890 --> 02:26:40.390]
Well the island queen would never have forgiven us

[02:26:40.390 --> 02:26:42.550]
So we'd let the entire first day go by when I plan that

[02:26:42.550 --> 02:26:45.770]
It's 141 on 610 WIOD that he arrides your show

[02:26:46.490 --> 02:26:47.370]
What is that?

[02:26:48.410 --> 02:26:49.550]
Is that something you impotence?

[02:26:50.810 --> 02:26:52.950]
Yeah, from Richard Pactor about Uncle Bond

[02:26:52.950 --> 02:26:53.870]
Richard Pactor

[02:26:53.870 --> 02:26:54.710]
He got our...

[02:26:54.710 --> 02:26:56.450]
He's like he faxed because

[02:26:56.450 --> 02:27:00.650]
It's a dear Neil despite the fact that I had nothing to do with your original acquisition of the Uncle Bond's I albums

[02:27:00.650 --> 02:27:02.350]
Which we now know because we just heard from the guy right

[02:27:02.350 --> 02:27:07.210]
I'm trying to get you some now so if your boat doctor can't find him hopefully I'll be able to help out

[02:27:08.790 --> 02:27:09.590]
Pretty impressive

[02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:14.710]
Did you read your R&R this week if no this was in Street Talk? Yeah, Rose Zafolder showed this to me

[02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:15.450]
Should I read it?

[02:27:15.510 --> 02:27:15.730]
Sure

[02:27:15.730 --> 02:27:16.890]
I haven't seen it

[02:27:16.890 --> 02:27:21.250]
After a year of AM drive at Guy Gannett Classic Rocker WZTA Miami

[02:27:21.250 --> 02:27:27.090]
Controversial personality Neil Rogers has crossed the street for mid days at NewsTonguedWIODAM

[02:27:27.090 --> 02:27:29.370]
Zeta General Manager Tim...

[02:27:29.370 --> 02:27:29.830]
You're right

[02:27:30.370 --> 02:27:32.210]
Can you believe that he called for you?

[02:27:32.330 --> 02:27:34.530]
And he thinks we're not gonna mention his name on the air?

[02:27:34.830 --> 02:27:35.590]
Tim Williams?

[02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:37.710]
Because he's got young children?

[02:27:38.030 --> 02:27:39.290]
What the hell does that have to do with anything?

[02:27:40.130 --> 02:27:45.690]
And he's not a cubic figure while he's a General Manager of two major market radio stations as shocking as that may be

[02:27:46.330 --> 02:27:48.970]
And he thinks we're not gonna mention his name on the air?

[02:27:49.470 --> 02:27:55.330]
But anyway it's in print here so I guess Zeta General Manager Tim was cited the philosophical differences

[02:27:55.330 --> 02:27:59.330]
But Rogers was a tad more direct calling Zeta Management subhuman douchebag

[02:27:59.330 --> 02:27:59.970]
All right

[02:27:59.970 --> 02:28:01.970]
So how does he really feel?

[02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:04.210]
That's the end, okay?

[02:28:05.270 --> 02:28:06.450]
Okay, and that great is that...

[02:28:06.450 --> 02:28:06.690]
Of course

[02:28:06.690 --> 02:28:08.250]
It says go easy on Bill Wise

[02:28:08.250 --> 02:28:11.450]
Why would we have to go easy on Bill Bill is the greatest guy in the world

[02:28:12.190 --> 02:28:14.770]
Anything we want to play is said, and what's wrong with that?

[02:28:14.930 --> 02:28:16.290]
That's a tame, okay?

[02:28:16.450 --> 02:28:17.090]
Now who said...

[02:28:17.090 --> 02:28:19.230]
I'd hate to think of what he wants us to play, okay?

[02:28:19.330 --> 02:28:20.370]
Now who said we have to go?

[02:28:20.530 --> 02:28:21.050]
Who said that?

[02:28:21.290 --> 02:28:22.690]
Who said Bill Wise?

[02:28:22.850 --> 02:28:23.290]
Who said that?

[02:28:23.310 --> 02:28:24.410]
Your pal Rich Panky

[02:28:24.410 --> 02:28:26.230]
Oh, that's called the ultimate groupie

[02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:27.090]
Oh, geez

[02:28:27.730 --> 02:28:28.090]
Britt...

[02:28:28.090 --> 02:28:29.210]
No, we're not gonna do it

[02:28:29.210 --> 02:28:31.430]
I refuse to go easy on Bill Wise

[02:28:32.230 --> 02:28:33.390]
You want to rip him now?

[02:28:34.030 --> 02:28:35.650]
I'm not gonna rip him, but...

[02:28:35.650 --> 02:28:36.030]
Go ahead

[02:28:36.610 --> 02:28:37.590]
I want to rip him

[02:28:37.590 --> 02:28:38.090]
Spike

[02:28:38.090 --> 02:28:39.810]
I want to call him Spike

[02:28:40.450 --> 02:28:41.170]
Spike Wise

[02:28:41.170 --> 02:28:43.210]
Yeah, sounds like a baseball player, doesn't it?

[02:28:43.310 --> 02:28:46.090]
Spike Wise for Atlanta?

[02:28:46.270 --> 02:28:46.790]
For the Red Sun

[02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:48.030]
Okay, for the Red Sun

[02:28:48.030 --> 02:28:48.890]
Spike Wise sounds good

[02:28:48.890 --> 02:28:52.650]
Okay, 143, Steve is in a building and he's gonna have his usual Budbath here

[02:28:52.650 --> 02:28:53.870]
From 2 to 6 this afternoon

[02:28:53.870 --> 02:28:54.410]
All right

[02:28:54.410 --> 02:28:56.390]
And he promises us that...

[02:28:56.390 --> 02:28:57.590]
Look at that, now who are these guys?

[02:28:57.790 --> 02:29:00.530]
So these are one of the Yokel TV states looks like Channel 4 to me

[02:29:00.530 --> 02:29:01.290]
Channel 4?

[02:29:01.350 --> 02:29:01.770]
Am I right?

[02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:03.970]
Hey listen, I know Channel 4 when I see him

[02:29:03.970 --> 02:29:06.130]
Say hello to Anna asqueed for us

[02:29:06.130 --> 02:29:06.370]
Okay

[02:29:06.370 --> 02:29:09.270]
Come on, I got a lot of friends over there at Channel 4, okay?

[02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:10.790]
John Hill Rich

[02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:14.170]
Channel that we were the weatherman and Michael Puthney and all my good friends over there

[02:29:14.170 --> 02:29:14.870]
How do I leave out?

[02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:15.250]
Tony?

[02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:16.130]
How can I leave Tony?

[02:29:16.330 --> 02:29:16.510]
Tony?

[02:29:17.090 --> 02:29:18.790]
I got a lot of buddies over there at Channel 4

[02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:20.170]
At least I hope still

[02:29:20.170 --> 02:29:22.030]
Anyway, I was starting to say about Steve

[02:29:22.030 --> 02:29:25.670]
He promises that Rick will not be on to at least the last hour today

[02:29:26.130 --> 02:29:26.790]
Is that true?

[02:29:28.670 --> 02:29:29.130]
What's that?

[02:29:29.130 --> 02:29:30.390]
Oh, he's going to be on tomorrow?

[02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:31.110]
Oh great

[02:29:31.110 --> 02:29:32.530]
For all four hours tomorrow

[02:29:32.530 --> 02:29:36.310]
And the Steve and the Rick are going to tell us about their male bonding tomorrow

[02:29:36.310 --> 02:29:37.810]
Right here out here, it's going to be really exciting

[02:29:37.810 --> 02:29:39.330]
Okay, 60-0-2

[02:29:39.330 --> 02:29:40.070]
And let's take a call

[02:29:40.070 --> 02:29:41.990]
This is our first call from Plantation

[02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:42.730]
ought to be a hate call

[02:29:42.730 --> 02:29:43.090]
Hello

[02:29:43.090 --> 02:29:45.730]
Yeah, Neil, Plantation Larry, how are you?

[02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:46.970]
Hey, pretty good, how you doing, Larry?

[02:29:46.990 --> 02:29:49.210]
Very good, I want to wish you a lot of luck at WIOD

[02:29:49.210 --> 02:29:49.810]
Thank you

[02:29:49.810 --> 02:29:52.190]
And it's funny, I started picking you up on FM

[02:29:52.190 --> 02:29:53.990]
This is the first time I've heard John A FM

[02:29:53.990 --> 02:29:54.870]
Are you serious?

[02:29:55.030 --> 02:29:56.750]
That's it, I feel like a real Floridian now

[02:29:56.750 --> 02:29:57.190]
That's good

[02:29:57.190 --> 02:29:59.070]
You're a little worried about this, you're not feeling a little boring today, Larry

[02:29:59.070 --> 02:30:01.230]
So you've been in Florida long enough, how long you've been here?

[02:30:01.490 --> 02:30:03.810]
We're doing my third year in January

[02:30:03.810 --> 02:30:06.750]
Three years, man, after another couple of years you learned a really good way

[02:30:06.750 --> 02:30:07.770]
You're still on the honeymoon

[02:30:07.770 --> 02:30:11.550]
Don't believe all that crap Steve says about how he loves Miami and what a great town is

[02:30:11.550 --> 02:30:13.330]
Is it's a bush-league douchebag town

[02:30:13.330 --> 02:30:15.450]
It's like 50 years behind the times

[02:30:15.450 --> 02:30:17.390]
And once you get used to it, you'll fit right in, okay?

[02:30:17.650 --> 02:30:19.530]
Okay, and the one on the real and the other thought

[02:30:19.530 --> 02:30:21.310]
It sounds like you're working on it, Larry

[02:30:21.310 --> 02:30:23.010]
Okay, did you see the landing moving?

[02:30:23.470 --> 02:30:23.610]
No

[02:30:23.610 --> 02:30:24.590]
You didn't see it

[02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:26.350]
Good move, you don't want to see it?

[02:30:26.470 --> 02:30:28.670]
Not into John Lennon, you know, he's a pretty ugly guy

[02:30:28.670 --> 02:30:30.930]
Well, I wish you a lot of luck, you two blend

[02:30:30.930 --> 02:30:31.870]
And I see, okay

[02:30:31.870 --> 02:30:33.290]
I'll be listening to you, Joe

[02:30:33.290 --> 02:30:34.370]
Thanks a lot, bye-bye

[02:30:34.370 --> 02:30:37.350]
Although that Brian Epstein, he must have needed contact or something, huh?

[02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:42.570]
Because he was evidently obsessed with, I don't think it was with John Lennon

[02:30:42.570 --> 02:30:44.630]
And I think it was with the Lennon sisters, is that what it was?

[02:30:44.750 --> 02:30:45.330]
I don't know, I don't know

[02:30:45.330 --> 02:30:46.970]
I think they got the story screwed up, come on, please

[02:30:46.970 --> 02:30:47.870]
Okay, Miami, hello

[02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:49.310]
Steve, how you doing?

[02:30:49.430 --> 02:30:49.870]
Pretty good

[02:30:49.870 --> 02:30:50.810]
Pretty good

[02:30:50.810 --> 02:30:51.470]
What's up, dude?

[02:30:51.790 --> 02:30:53.230]
First time A.M. Colour

[02:30:53.550 --> 02:30:58.570]
Alright, now listen, one of the things we have to do, we did a couple of years ago, we got to get all those FM douchebags

[02:30:58.990 --> 02:31:04.310]
Back over to A.M. I said all that stuff about A.M. being dead and it was hovering, you know, it was an intensive care

[02:31:04.310 --> 02:31:08.290]
But now we've given it a little transfusion, so now A.M. is back to the place to be

[02:31:08.290 --> 02:31:11.550]
Yeah, I think it was the first time I ever put my radio to A.M.

[02:31:11.910 --> 02:31:12.230]
Fantastic

[02:31:12.810 --> 02:31:13.670]
How old are you, sir?

[02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:14.490]
I'm 18

[02:31:14.490 --> 02:31:18.770]
18, perfect demographic, you've got 9Q of over 2, you sound like an articular guy

[02:31:19.130 --> 02:31:20.190]
Are you a good looking, sir?

[02:31:20.810 --> 02:31:21.310]
Oh, yeah, very

[02:31:21.310 --> 02:31:23.210]
Okay, good, that's just what we want on this show

[02:31:23.210 --> 02:31:25.570]
Well listen, I'm only here at work with my buddy John

[02:31:25.570 --> 02:31:27.710]
Great, how old is John?

[02:31:30.210 --> 02:31:30.530]
22

[02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:33.270]
22, now he's a new A.M. Lister also?

[02:31:33.490 --> 02:31:33.750]
Yeah

[02:31:33.750 --> 02:31:36.410]
Look at that, too, right there on the first day

[02:31:36.410 --> 02:31:38.970]
We just see all the time on FM and they're fantastic

[02:31:39.290 --> 02:31:41.630]
Yeah, you're giving up that station for a suckers, right, sir?

[02:31:41.970 --> 02:31:42.150]
Yeah

[02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:42.650]
Okay

[02:31:43.570 --> 02:31:49.010]
Anyway, we're here with John at work and we got a back on it, you're going to play guns and roses on A.M.

[02:31:49.870 --> 02:31:50.190]
Tomorrow

[02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:52.970]
I don't have it here, I would play it right now

[02:31:52.970 --> 02:31:57.650]
Or if I had time, we'd run next to it at a GTR but they're busy busting the walls loose over here

[02:31:57.650 --> 02:31:58.630]
I make 20 bucks in this nail

[02:31:58.950 --> 02:31:59.730]
Tomorrow, okay?

[02:32:00.130 --> 02:32:01.410]
Trust me, I won't let you down

[02:32:01.410 --> 02:32:03.150]
Alright, alright, thanks a lot, sir

[02:32:03.150 --> 02:32:03.970]
Thank you, bye-bye

[02:32:04.330 --> 02:32:06.010]
Was that incredible or what?

[02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:09.490]
Now, TVs here, you know, this must be a slow news day, is that it?

[02:32:09.570 --> 02:32:14.070]
Because they found those two bodies on the Julia Tettle Causeway and I think there's a tie-in between them coming over here

[02:32:14.610 --> 02:32:17.130]
They had to come to this neighborhood anyway, is that what you mean?

[02:32:17.130 --> 02:32:22.570]
Okay, so anyway, Channel 4 is here, so those of you who sticks out there that watch the local news, those of you who can't afford a satellite dish

[02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:29.210]
Please, please go right ahead and take all of the food you want because believe me, we want to get it out of here before you know who comes in, get Sostle and hysterical

[02:32:30.410 --> 02:32:33.050]
Okay, 147 and let's go to Fort Lauderdale, hello

[02:32:33.050 --> 02:32:33.970]
Hello, how you doing?

[02:32:34.130 --> 02:32:34.490]
Pretty good

[02:32:34.490 --> 02:32:36.470]
How many times are you going to say douchebag for Channel 4?

[02:32:36.750 --> 02:32:37.930]
Douchebag douchebag, okay?

[02:32:38.130 --> 02:32:41.250]
Subhuman mung brain douchebag, that's three times they got it on tape, they're rolling

[02:32:41.250 --> 02:32:42.770]
Now you won't be on the two

[02:32:43.130 --> 02:32:45.530]
I'm thinking of GTR, have you run in a home in the Queen yet?

[02:32:45.530 --> 02:32:47.870]
No, but I guess the bread song is more than nothing

[02:32:48.250 --> 02:32:54.570]
You know, I did not know until this morning that Herman's in one room and McBean's in another room

[02:32:54.570 --> 02:32:57.030]
Oh yeah, and they know one much of who they get too close together

[02:32:57.030 --> 02:32:58.370]
Maybe that's why they sound so good, huh?

[02:32:58.470 --> 02:33:01.310]
Yeah, I didn't know this and I said, where's Skip?

[02:33:01.390 --> 02:33:04.410]
You know, and he says, well, he's in his room, I hope he doesn't come over here, you know?

[02:33:04.590 --> 02:33:06.390]
I mean, it was like, I never had any idea

[02:33:07.270 --> 02:33:10.510]
Everybody's very friendly here, but it's only as long as they keep them in separate rooms

[02:33:10.510 --> 02:33:14.470]
Like our news people are like in a totally separate part of the building, we can't see them

[02:33:14.470 --> 02:33:15.690]
Or feel them, so...

[02:33:15.690 --> 02:33:16.750]
Or feel them, that's correct

[02:33:17.270 --> 02:33:19.850]
You saw them, believe me, sir, you wouldn't want to either, okay?

[02:33:20.470 --> 02:33:22.150]
How your girlfriend, Patty Murray

[02:33:22.530 --> 02:33:26.550]
Patty's doing, she's a little emotional in the state, but she'll be alright, she understands now

[02:33:26.550 --> 02:33:27.330]
I think, I hope

[02:33:27.330 --> 02:33:31.130]
I talked, yeah, we met a little chat with Pat, a little chat with her last week

[02:33:31.130 --> 02:33:33.390]
Well, have her in here one day for a few minutes

[02:33:33.390 --> 02:33:35.990]
The real question everybody really wants to know is

[02:33:36.750 --> 02:33:39.530]
After I'm really ripping W-I-O-D when they talk

[02:33:39.530 --> 02:33:41.010]
Exactly, call her and everything

[02:33:41.010 --> 02:33:43.570]
That's right, now I'll send you over there, I guess it's the big box, huh?

[02:33:43.570 --> 02:33:47.250]
Not, well that's part of it, believe me, everybody's got a price, but no, they change the management

[02:33:47.250 --> 02:33:49.190]
The assassin that long gone on the Anthony

[02:33:49.190 --> 02:33:49.810]
I see

[02:33:49.810 --> 02:33:56.550]
And he was the one who really does screwing in the case of Calder and Sandy and what was his name, Majuri Sullivan

[02:33:56.550 --> 02:34:00.430]
For a whole lot of people, I really got a bad deal here, and the current management will agree with that

[02:34:00.430 --> 02:34:02.510]
They're not gonna lie about it, they have no disagreement

[02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:05.250]
I see, so who do we thank now, Bill Wise, is he the...

[02:34:05.250 --> 02:34:08.810]
Bill Wise and Mike Disney and Brother Walt and all of these people are great

[02:34:08.810 --> 02:34:09.790]
Well good, so far

[02:34:09.790 --> 02:34:12.410]
Well, I listened to Herman and McQueen in the morning, so...

[02:34:12.410 --> 02:34:15.310]
I turned over from them to here, so it works out good

[02:34:15.310 --> 02:34:17.430]
Excellent, you're a great American, sir, and have a wonderful day

[02:34:17.430 --> 02:34:17.970]
Okay, thank you, Bob

[02:34:17.970 --> 02:34:21.310]
Well, we had more tinkling today than in a long time, haven't we?

[02:34:21.430 --> 02:34:22.110]
It has been incredible

[02:34:22.110 --> 02:34:23.690]
Like Steve said, it's the honeymoon, right?

[02:34:23.810 --> 02:34:24.230]
Oh, sure

[02:34:24.230 --> 02:34:26.230]
And a couple more days, they'll all be calling up

[02:34:26.230 --> 02:34:28.790]
You're disgusting, we want hell and fat

[02:34:29.150 --> 02:34:32.790]
We're so upset and we're so hurty

[02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:37.490]
Oh God, I'm telling you, listen, Nick, we get any of those geriatric voices on here, you know what I'm saying?

[02:34:37.490 --> 02:34:41.030]
Like, deep six of them, tell them to basically drop dead and get rid of Mariah

[02:34:41.030 --> 02:34:42.370]
Unless it's the struggling lady

[02:34:42.370 --> 02:34:46.490]
If it's the struggling lady, you'll get to recognize her, the one that says, you're struggling, you're struggling

[02:34:47.030 --> 02:34:48.210]
She's fine, I would like her

[02:34:48.210 --> 02:34:49.450]
On certain days

[02:34:50.030 --> 02:34:53.830]
Okay, let's take our last break here and make way, Kane is going to be along a two with another one of those

[02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:55.150]
Contrag controversies

[02:34:55.550 --> 02:34:59.030]
And he's already got the guest warming up in the other studio with gloves on

[02:34:59.030 --> 02:35:01.410]
It's 149, it's 610, WIOD

[02:35:02.030 --> 02:35:04.470]
Bruce Hoffman is 610, WIOD

[02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:08.510]
Okay, 153, WIOD, did I screw up there?

[02:35:09.030 --> 02:35:11.830]
It's every time I do that every time, okay, I'll do that every time, that's fine

[02:35:11.830 --> 02:35:12.990]
We're just a little inside stuff

[02:35:13.550 --> 02:35:17.070]
I find it fascinating, we're commenting on this during the break, the Channel 4

[02:35:17.790 --> 02:35:20.510]
Which is not really that far, but they're like downtown, you know

[02:35:20.950 --> 02:35:23.030]
And they came out here with a camera crew and everything

[02:35:23.030 --> 02:35:25.350]
And Channel 7, which is right there

[02:35:25.350 --> 02:35:28.310]
And I'm sure they're listening as I speak right now, okay?

[02:35:28.670 --> 02:35:30.790]
Our good friends over there at your hometown station

[02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:35.570]
Channel 7 hasn't come by, so evidently this isn't a big enough news story

[02:35:36.390 --> 02:35:40.270]
And Nick is writing a note on here, it says TV7 never comes here

[02:35:40.670 --> 02:35:40.990]
Really?

[02:35:41.330 --> 02:35:44.030]
Do you think I thought they had something to do with me parking in that spot

[02:35:44.030 --> 02:35:45.910]
This thing that said Edmund Anson on it?

[02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:48.210]
Yeah, that could be it, I thought that was the one they told away

[02:35:48.890 --> 02:35:50.010]
It's Sally and the trunk

[02:35:50.690 --> 02:35:53.290]
Yeah, the man who still gives me fits, you do know that don't you?

[02:35:53.290 --> 02:35:53.630]
I know

[02:35:53.630 --> 02:35:56.310]
Okay, anyway, six minutes till two, we're almost at the end of the line

[02:35:56.310 --> 02:35:59.230]
And let's get, few calls in here before we run out of time

[02:35:59.230 --> 02:36:02.250]
Because these people we've made them wait a long time today, I don't know why for sure

[02:36:02.690 --> 02:36:03.930]
But they better get used to it

[02:36:03.930 --> 02:36:07.010]
And all you can heads out there, now listen, all you old AM listeners

[02:36:07.630 --> 02:36:09.070]
You've got to spread the word, okay?

[02:36:09.170 --> 02:36:11.490]
Because it's going to take a little time, we're going to get back to those days

[02:36:11.490 --> 02:36:14.570]
When we had some fun on the air and we've had a good time today

[02:36:14.570 --> 02:36:16.650]
I mean, this hasn't been, I mean people have tuned into

[02:36:16.650 --> 02:36:18.590]
Well, what's this all about? You know, what does he do?

[02:36:19.350 --> 02:36:21.170]
Well, if you listen today, you wouldn't find out

[02:36:21.170 --> 02:36:24.150]
Because this is our first day back after we're long, a three day layoff

[02:36:24.490 --> 02:36:26.210]
And it's just the way it is, okay?

[02:36:26.690 --> 02:36:27.670]
South Miami, hello

[02:36:28.590 --> 02:36:29.250]
Hello, Neil

[02:36:29.250 --> 02:36:29.890]
Yes, sir

[02:36:31.030 --> 02:36:31.690]
Are you on there?

[02:36:32.010 --> 02:36:33.470]
Yeah, I think so, sounds like us

[02:36:33.470 --> 02:36:36.470]
Okay, I just wanted to welcome you to the I.O.G.

[02:36:36.730 --> 02:36:37.130]
Thank you

[02:36:37.130 --> 02:36:39.370]
And I listen to you for years, and you've been great

[02:36:39.370 --> 02:36:41.230]
Keep up the good work here at the American

[02:36:41.230 --> 02:36:41.610]
Thank you, sir, I'm very American

[02:36:41.610 --> 02:36:43.470]
Well, you are, too, sir, thanks for the tinkalok

[02:36:43.470 --> 02:36:44.750]
I just want to ask you one question, yep

[02:36:44.750 --> 02:36:46.470]
Are you going to vote on an Amendment 10?

[02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:48.470]
Oh, no, vote no on Amendment 10

[02:36:48.470 --> 02:36:50.330]
First of all, the campus is too low

[02:36:50.330 --> 02:36:54.610]
And he's a faker, these doctors, man, want it their way, vote no, please

[02:36:54.610 --> 02:36:58.010]
Okay, because we're all confused here and we just didn't know how to go on and vote

[02:36:58.010 --> 02:37:00.730]
Across me, what I tell you, no on 10, okay?

[02:37:00.790 --> 02:37:02.310]
I know what club Peppa says

[02:37:02.310 --> 02:37:03.230]
Yeah, no on 10

[02:37:03.230 --> 02:37:03.930]
Oh, what fun?

[02:37:03.950 --> 02:37:06.150]
I'm holding a gimp on them and put it

[02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:06.550]
What fun?

[02:37:07.150 --> 02:37:12.070]
It tries to me and say it's a bad deal and even many of the doctors privately they would never admit it pubically

[02:37:12.070 --> 02:37:17.170]
But privately they admit that that campus ridiculous and it's way too low and forget it, okay?

[02:37:17.590 --> 02:37:22.690]
And not that I'm in love with the lawyers either, but in this particular case the doctors are just out of their minds

[02:37:22.690 --> 02:37:24.330]
Waterdale by the sea, hello

[02:37:24.330 --> 02:37:30.130]
And congratulations, it's family, I think if anybody is looking for you, I suggest they don't call WIAC or WZ

[02:37:31.230 --> 02:37:32.630]
What are they saying?

[02:37:32.850 --> 02:37:38.510]
Well, what they are saying is, and receptionist who sounds like a very nice person indicated to me that she doesn't know where you went

[02:37:38.510 --> 02:37:41.110]
Yeah, I think it was kind of fun

[02:37:41.110 --> 02:37:47.430]
I wanted to see if they were going to play the game straight and say obviously he's no longer here and yet he is over at WRN

[02:37:47.430 --> 02:37:48.350]
I think that he didn't do it

[02:37:48.350 --> 02:37:50.870]
Isn't that something? Talk about paranoia, that's fine

[02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:52.930]
Well, it's paranoia but I don't think it's too classy

[02:37:52.930 --> 02:37:58.270]
No, it's not classy and not only that, but I came to an AM station, I was on their FM

[02:37:58.270 --> 02:38:04.250]
I came to an AM station that really isn't competing, I mean people who listen WIOD are not going to be classic rock listeners

[02:38:04.790 --> 02:38:11.430]
And I'm in a different time period, I'm not in a morning drive, I'm on a midday which so in no way shape or form are we competing with their FM

[02:38:11.430 --> 02:38:17.030]
I understand, and they still don't have the, they still don't have the honor to tell people exactly where I am

[02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:17.270]
They're ticked?

[02:38:17.890 --> 02:38:19.570]
Yeah, well, what do you mean they're ticked? That's tough

[02:38:19.570 --> 02:38:23.850]
If they would, if they would have treated us like human beings we might still be there, okay?

[02:38:23.950 --> 02:38:27.190]
Well, I can understand that, but we're glad we're with IOD and the WZ

[02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:29.390]
I'm sure you wish you all the luck and incidentally

[02:38:30.050 --> 02:38:33.090]
You finally talked to me and you did it without hanging up on it

[02:38:33.090 --> 02:38:37.750]
Okay, I have to speak in the back door, but of course you know who this is, but I hear a hit of sight thoughts

[02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:41.330]
Thanks a lot, I don't know if anyone who that was, that wasn't a chronic one

[02:38:41.330 --> 02:38:44.270]
I don't know who it was, and he sounded okay, he sure did

[02:38:44.270 --> 02:38:49.170]
Maybe he had, you know, was putting on a good act for us on his best behavior or something like that

[02:38:49.170 --> 02:38:54.070]
Oh wait a minute, Nick knows who it was, it says that was Bob in...

[02:38:54.070 --> 02:38:54.590]
Ah!

[02:38:56.670 --> 02:38:57.750]
Was it really?

[02:38:58.070 --> 02:38:59.930]
Ah! That wasn't the Bob I know

[02:38:59.930 --> 02:39:02.590]
Now see, that's something we got a cure over here that we're alive with

[02:39:02.590 --> 02:39:06.770]
He has attacked all the stations, but this one he's attacked more than all the other ones

[02:39:06.770 --> 02:39:10.030]
And we have got to do something about that

[02:39:10.030 --> 02:39:14.210]
Bob from Hoppano, but he was on his best behavior, just don't ever call us again, okay Bob?

[02:39:14.930 --> 02:39:15.910]
Lighthouse point, hello

[02:39:15.910 --> 02:39:19.590]
Yeah, I want to speak to the bird, I ain't call us speaking to O.K. I want to speak to the bird

[02:39:19.590 --> 02:39:21.890]
Okay, so go ahead, how do you talk to the bird?

[02:39:23.090 --> 02:39:24.830]
I'm just saying you might catch some birds

[02:39:24.830 --> 02:39:27.870]
Oh sir, it's a bird, a bird, a bird, a bird, a bird, a bird

[02:39:28.950 --> 02:39:31.050]
Now I'm supposed to consider the source, right?

[02:39:31.330 --> 02:39:32.830]
Yeah, that's one of your buddies from Davy

[02:39:32.830 --> 02:39:33.350]
Yeah, right

[02:39:34.050 --> 02:39:35.930]
So anyway, I think that's a good call to close

[02:39:36.310 --> 02:39:37.550]
I was going to do it, don't you?

[02:39:37.930 --> 02:39:40.230]
Yeah, perfect, we only got about a minute or two left here

[02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:44.270]
And I want to say this has been, the audience has been really magn... like the last caller, they've been very nice to us

[02:39:44.270 --> 02:39:44.670]
Absolutely

[02:39:45.070 --> 02:39:48.210]
And no, we just didn't have too much of that, although I'm sure we'll have more days to come

[02:39:48.210 --> 02:39:50.770]
And we'll realize, but every one of those is worth a couple of points

[02:39:52.250 --> 02:39:55.570]
But you know, tomorrow's election day, we don't want to sway you, we don't want to have any influence

[02:39:55.570 --> 02:39:58.950]
We hope that those of you who are for New Caucus will go out in both seven or eight times

[02:39:59.610 --> 02:40:02.650]
Although it isn't, you know, it's going to be, do I dare say it?

[02:40:02.950 --> 02:40:05.190]
It's going to be a bush landslide, I hate to say that

[02:40:05.190 --> 02:40:07.630]
And especially in the electoral college, it's going to be a landslide

[02:40:08.090 --> 02:40:12.550]
You shouldn't take that for granted though, and those of you who are going to have the courage to vote for New Caucus and Florida

[02:40:12.550 --> 02:40:14.130]
Which I think that's about three of us

[02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:17.690]
Don't need to tear it, okay? By all these redneck Yahoo's

[02:40:17.690 --> 02:40:20.470]
I mean, there's nothing we can do about that, this is a Neanderthal redneck state

[02:40:20.790 --> 02:40:24.530]
All we can do is get out there and vote, and of course there are a lot of other important things to vote for too

[02:40:24.530 --> 02:40:30.650]
That great race between Buddy McKin and Connie Mack, which is like choosing between death by hanging or the electric chair

[02:40:31.330 --> 02:40:35.450]
And I guess, you know, you just got to go with McKin because he's the less malignant of the two

[02:40:36.110 --> 02:40:36.430]
Barely

[02:40:36.430 --> 02:40:41.270]
But boy, talk about articulate, I mean, if that's the best that this state can produce for the United States Senate

[02:40:41.270 --> 02:40:42.490]
What does that tell you?

[02:40:42.770 --> 02:40:42.870]
Right

[02:40:42.870 --> 02:40:46.010]
And no one on Amendment 10, and basically you all know the rest

[02:40:46.010 --> 02:40:46.650]
Okay

[02:40:47.390 --> 02:40:52.670]
So in the meantime, we thank you very much in the, you've been marvelous and we thank the management here for making it so easy

[02:40:52.670 --> 02:40:55.850]
And for letting you sneak a little bit of food in and nobody got hostile or hysterical

[02:40:55.850 --> 02:41:00.170]
I do see them lined up at the door now though, I have a feeling that we're going to hear a little bit about that

[02:41:00.170 --> 02:41:02.230]
But we're used to that, okay?

[02:41:02.530 --> 02:41:04.690]
We would feel like culture shock if we didn't get a little

[02:41:04.690 --> 02:41:06.010]
At the end of the show

[02:41:06.010 --> 02:41:09.850]
Okay, stay tuned for Steve, he's next with another one of his great contrived debates

[02:41:09.850 --> 02:41:14.310]
Blacks for New Caucus, Blacks for Bush, and Blacks who just don't give a damn about either one of them

[02:41:14.310 --> 02:41:19.910]
Have a great day and we'll see you tomorrow morning at 10 after Mike Reneerie right here on 610 WIOD
