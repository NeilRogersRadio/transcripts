[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280]
That's not bad, we're just not bad, right?

[00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.240]
So you're going to enjoy it.

[00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.480]
And we already did do a thing for Guns Just Grill

[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.520]
when you weren't paying any attention.

[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.540]
So we're all cut up.

[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.100]
Isn't that great?

[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.520]
Marvelous.

[00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:12.860]
That's it.

[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.120]
I'm just delighted that you did that, man,

[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.440]
because that's what we needed to wake this audience up.

[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.180]
A good cranche.

[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.660]
The message says, you may want to read that before you read it

[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.040]
out loud.

[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.700]
And who it's from?

[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.480]
Who is that?

[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.460]
You can't guess.

[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.280]
It says Ozzy.

[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.500]
I don't understand.

[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.700]
The phone number looks very familiar.

[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.680]
How about that?

[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.720]
Does it look like a maybe South Miami number?

[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.900]
Trends.

[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.340]
Trends coming out.

[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.680]
Trends.

[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.680]

[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.680]

[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.440]
Yeah.

[00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.200]
What does that mean?

[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.240]
Our five to nine?

[00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.860]
What does that mean?

[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.180]
No, 5.9.

[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.160]
Who's Ozzy?

[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.900]
Oh, I know who that is.

[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.640]
That's Fruitcake.

[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.200]
Ozzycake.

[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.560]
Well, I thought it was the 6-1.

[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.640]
Now it's a 5-9.

[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.580]
Oh, we've got that.

[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.660]
I better hurry up and get it out.

[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.180]
Pretty quick.

[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.060]
We'll be down to a 1.

[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.640]
It's like when your horse is two lengths in front,

[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.800]
you say, OK, end the race.

[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.640]
Now what in God's name is that?

[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.940]
Oh, my God.

[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.160]
Are you out of your mind?

[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.480]
Mm-hmm.

[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.360]
Thank you, Angela.

[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.560]
And crazy cookies and a huckleberry.

[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.460]
Mm-hmm.

[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.900]
You believe this?

[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.740]
Thank you.

[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.620]
This is incredible.

[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.740]
This is so good.

[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.080]
And the cheese bread?

[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.260]
Unbelievable.

[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.220]
Indescribable.

[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.800]
Great.

[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.860]
Thank you.

[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.900]

[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.440]
Mm-hmm.

[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.240]
Our friends at Pasta Bili's Manatee,

[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.160]
I did themself today.

[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.100]
This is just what can I say?

[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.220]
How could he possibly have the number

[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.860]
when it's not even in a computer yet?

[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.700]
Oh, they gave us some huckleberries.

[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.500]
Oh, cute.

[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.240]
OK, dump the bleeps, the beeps.

[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.760]
I don't think it's necessary.

[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.000]
Now see, if you'd get off the phone there, Mr. Yanta,

[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.840]
we could call you.

[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.600]
Now maybe you took the phone off the hook, huh?

[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.880]
Think so?

[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.860]
He must have called waiting.

[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.780]
Oh, he does.

[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.160]
He has at least two lines.

[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.860]
You've got probably ten lines on.

[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.200]
Oh, yeah.

[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.580]
He's got more lines than we do.

[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.420]
Yes, he does.

[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.580]
That's a matter of fact.

[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.480]
How are we going to eat this?

[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.080]
I can't eat this.

[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.400]
We're going to have to take that home.

[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.940]
Yeah.

[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.460]
I, uh, later.

[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.020]
Oh, they're in.

[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.040]
Look at that.

[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.740]
He is shining.

[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.440]
Great.

[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.840]
That's great.

[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.240]
Yeah.

[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.280]
Doesn't he look like he's shining?

[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.480]
Or flaming something like that.

[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.820]
Yeah.

[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.500]
Okay, it's 10 o'clock on Zeta 4.

[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.600]
Hey, Neil.

[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.980]
Yes.

[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.120]
I hope you beat me in the ring.

[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.000]
You better than I am.

[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.600]
Even the competition agrees.

[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.100]
The Neil Roger show on WZTA Miami Beach Fort Lauderdale

[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.660]
and the Palm Beaches is the best morning show in South Florida.

[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.440]
I think I don't get the ninth year on an AM station

[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.420]
as a hero in my book.

[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.840]
You're like, say Thomas the Quietest.

[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.880]
You got no problem with me.

[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.160]
Even the other morning shows listen to the Neil Roger show

[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.600]
on Zeta 4.

[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.740]
I hope you beat me in the ring.

[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.680]
You better than I am.

[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.680]
Okay, now I think we got to take care of this little problem

[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.600]
here before we go on.

[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.880]
Oh, good.

[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.280]
This is the one that was busy before.

[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.220]
Right?

[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.880]
Mm-hmm.

[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.760]
Well, it's ringing now.

[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.300]
The shallow show.

[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.980]
Yeah, is this Aussie?

[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.540]
Yeah, hold on one second.

[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.180]
Oh, come on.

[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.660]
Hold on.

[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.260]
It's a radio show.

[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.880]
We can't hold on for you, Aussie.

[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.540]
What's he going to do?

[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.440]
Go get Harriet now.

[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.420]
Aussie.

[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:48.200]
Hello.

[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.380]
Yes, Aussie.

[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.600]
How can I help you?

[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.880]
Now, what is this?

[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.240]
What is this in-sippet message that we have here?

[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.320]
They haven't even put their numbers into the computers

[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.360]
and belts, though, yet.

[00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.780]

[00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.420]
Is the, uh...

[00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.360]
No.

[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.300]
Mark Cune came over to my house the other day.

[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.160]
Yeah, Betty did.

[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.420]
And we discussed this in length.

[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.120]
Mm-hmm.

[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.080]
And the 6.1 is Peter Boulder's IQ.

[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.680]
It's not, uh...

[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.900]
Ha! Ha! Ha!

[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.820]
Oh, I think you got that backwards.

[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.160]
I think it's Mark Cune's IQ.

[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.400]
And I think you got the number backwards too, by the way.

[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.480]
It's Peter Boulder.

[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.500]
Well, it could be, I don't know.

[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.500]
Yeah, I think a 1-6.

[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.620]
Did you have it?

[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.080]
That's what I got.

[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.720]
You had a psychic...

[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.560]
Was this a psychic reading, on you?

[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.660]

[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.460]
It's the call to the monitor reading.

[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.560]
Monitor reading.

[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.740]
Like, when you look in the screen,

[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.400]
wait till Stan sees his...

[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.280]
There are no numbers in there yet, baby.

[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.360]
Well, go to your computer and somebody

[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.300]
give me some instruction.

[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.940]
They're not in there till tomorrow.

[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.380]
See, he makes...

[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.720]
The model, right?

[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.800]
You don't think they haven't done yet?

[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.940]
No, they don't do them until the night before.

[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.500]
Right.

[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.840]
You know better than that.

[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.340]
No, I don't know better than that.

[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.600]
That's the way they feed him in there.

[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.940]
They do them in there the evening before, late afternoon.

[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.560]
Really?

[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.080]
Yeah.

[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.020]
Why wouldn't they be ahead of it, that one step ahead?

[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.820]
They're not.

[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.740]
Why do you think they would hold them back?

[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.060]
You think they're holding them back for, uh...

[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.160]
Who's being naughty and nice?

[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.420]
Well, yeah, they hold it back for like a Thursday.

[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.880]
Mm-hmm.

[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.560]
Make it all look synchronized, you know, for a day.

[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.620]

[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.340]
Yeah, here's synchronicity in the great cut by the police.

[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.720]
Well, do you have any problem with that number?

[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.720]
With what? No, that would be nice.

[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.440]
It's not going to happen, but that would be real nice.

[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.000]
Oh, really?

[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.000]
Not possible.

[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.160]
Why is that not possible?

[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.580]
Because we'd have to do like a nine-share in January.

[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.420]
Are you out of your mind?

[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.240]
Well, okay, well, if you don't have faith in yourself,

[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.640]
how could anybody else have faith?

[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.080]
Exactly.

[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.360]
Okay, we're doing a seven.

[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.260]
Does that make you feel better?

[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.960]
I think you'll do a 15.

[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.940]
Okay, great.

[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.780]
I see. I see Zeta plates all over the U of M campus.

[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.300]
Do you really?

[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.380]
Yeah, we're big on campus.

[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.340]
If they only took...

[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.040]
They took the survey at Cooper City High in U of M.

[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.260]
We'd have a 28-shear.

[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.780]
I think so. They have Zeta things all over there.

[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.340]
And I put out less notes on everybody's windshield.

[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.300]
Saying you listen to Neil.

[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.920]
I spray-painting down there.

[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.880]
Good, I like that.

[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.200]
And that makes us a lot of friends when you do that.

[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.900]
I know. I leave. I'll go. I find Glenn's name.

[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.860]
Just spray-painting...

[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.280]
Just spray-pain WSHE on all the windshields, okay?

[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.280]
Okay, no problem.

[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.780]
Okay.

[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.540]
Have a nice one.

[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.540]
Good luck to you, Ozzy.

[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.360]
There you are.

[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.160]
So full of them on.

[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.880]
You betcha.

[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.420]
Sign my name, good.

[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.540]
Thanks, Ozzy.

[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.640]
He's a maniac.

[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.720]
Okay, it's a three minutes past 10.
