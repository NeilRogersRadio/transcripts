[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]
Drop in the bucket. It was kind of fun because we just did two seafood places back to back. It said 10 minutes after seven

[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.560]
Yeah, there was a spot in between them. Oh

[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.000]
Okay, like I said see if you had to say anything nobody would know the difference of course because our listeners are all a bunch of morons right?

[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.980]
They're all a bunch of dodo birds. You see what's going on out here just like before there's a dog shell out there

[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.200]
Oh, yeah, and he's leading him straight. Don't you follow him now come on guys

[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.920]
Just leave him to the Santoria house. Oh, all those little puppies are getting led to slaughter

[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.440]
I can't believe it anybody from the SPCA is listening get over here right away and save a pup for Christ. Okay?

[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.940]
My god, I can't believe what's going on here today

[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.760]
Who the hell needs these damn callers this stinkin town man these people have gone through this for 12 God for second years

[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.740]
You don't want to try one all these okay? Let's try one okay? Just with Allen see if they can redeem themselves

[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.540]
You know like a quality these games with you know like they play hard to get you can have a four I'm serious during times

[00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.940]
What I've had my highest numbers like you and I used to be on a night?

[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.140]
There were periods of time when you think that nobody was listening because the people here are unfriendly

[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.160]
Surely nasty and hostile okay, but I think you're wrong because I've run into people on the street

[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.180]
And they say they hear you say that and they say most of us are in our cars. I don't give it

[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.220]
I don't give it then but they're excuses. Okay, and they're gonna laugh a hell of a lot more

[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.820]
What I have to say then these subhuman douchebags on his phone. Okay, now that's a good all right

[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.420]
Let me prove a point is this a subhuman douchebag or what hello?

[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.380]
Hello

[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.620]
What is my beef with Dave County who said anything about Dave County?

[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.020]
Other than the fact that it's dead and that it's crime written and infested that it's like a festering sewer

[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.300]
I have no beef with Dave County

[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.800]
Where do you live?

[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.960]
My my Emmy Beach

[00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:03.240]
The Miami bitch. Oh my god. You've got to be pulling my leg aren't you are you yanking my chain? No, come on get cereal will you?

[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.500]
Get cereal with me honey you live on Miami Beach and you try to pedal us a song at a dance that it's livable and it's a

[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.480]
It's a civilized place. It's a barbaric wasteland. I am pissed off at you good

[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.460]
I want to know what your beef is about people over 30. That was just a joke. Okay, that they have no sense of humor

[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.640]
Do you have any sense of humor when's the last time you laugh probably the same time you had a good BM okay get on you?

[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.920]
Now see people on the beach okay if they just get a case of X-lacks over there the beach would solve a lot of their problems

[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.840]
I watched a little bit of this movie last night on cable project X

[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.060]
Yeah, and I said to big Dave they have a special version of that for Helen Dale in the beach is called project X-lacks

[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.060]
I mean what the hell is her story I'm pissed off it you

[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.160]
I mean anybody lives out of beach deserves what they get

[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.960]
See like a festering sewer over there who the hell is she kidding? Well call me mr. Exception as Glenn would say oh

[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.500]
I know you love that art. I have a good time every time I go there the the women are Foxy and

[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.780]
See what a wise idea it was stick that one call

[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.300]
Yeah, I'm gonna be doing a remote from the Seagull tomorrow. Okay. It's a 713 speaking of Foxy lady

[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.940]
Here's Jimmy Hendrix on Zeta 4

[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.300]
The man who did not die from drugs, but yeah, we don't play Foxy lady doing yeah, we do

[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.160]
Well, I don't want to play any Jimmy Hendrix. He's another one of those screamers like Springsteen and

[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.140]
Joe Cocker the same thing scream

[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.540]
That's some music man now maybe a road and yesterday Rose played we're wolf and London by Warren Zeevon

[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.740]
We're who was the London?

[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.340]
Like a novelty record. Okay. It's like something you'd expect here on tragic one oh 2.7 on Halloween

[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.900]
On Halloween exactly. Hey, I'm so glad you said that that was perfect. It's about time you did something we should play vehicle today

[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.600]
By the eyes of March. Oh, isn't that cute? That's a great record. Let's not and say we did okay

[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:09.480]
All right, good idea. We do have an open line in Broward at 777 9-3600. I just mentioned that yesterday. Yeah, I know it's hard to believe 777 9-3600

[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.060]
Now maybe Dennis and Gary would you would like you to take number six next because it's collect. Oh, okay

[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.000]
Are you calling collect? Yeah, where are you calling from?

[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.700]
Okay, okay, let's run up a good bill here

[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.220]
Good I hope so now I'm alive and so I can't even talk because I'm listening to you you're seven seconds

[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.460]
What is it? I know around a no we're on a four and a half second delay

[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.720]
I'm cracking up I can't even listen yeah, and then you get here the second time. I'm not exciting

[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.100]
Now I forgot what I was gonna say really yes

[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.460]
Well, I'm not gonna cut you short because you're calling collect. I want to run up a nice good bill on this okay

[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.280]
What's new now because these are the cheapest bastards you'd ever want to find in your life?

[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.220]
Not both see their sensitive about the management people in this building

[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.560]
I ask you a question. Are you listening to anything that I'm saying this morning?

[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.700]
I said these management people here are the cheapest people going

[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.000]
I wasn't talking about you and right away you're defensive and surly and paranoid. Oh

[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.740]
Yes, you are

[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.660]
I collect and they said yes, they accept the charges. You are cheap. I don't want to talk

[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.580]
May as well was hopeless. It was a hopeless case

[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.560]
I'm hopeless. It won't have a conversation. She wants just giggle on the radio. Yeah, you can relate to that. Yes, I can seven sixteen

[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.220]

I can't I just can't believe these people this morning like out of the clear blue like out of nowhere

[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.200]
And that's what this town is all about yesterday was borderline yesterday was okay

But this morning you just from the from the get-go as they say I don't know who it is that says that but from look at that

[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.440]
There's another look at that. It's the dog the dogs are coming this way. That's good. That's good

[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.500]

Well, he darted and died this morning in the electric chair at the state prison near Stark

[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.660]
He protested to the end that he was innocent of the 1973 killing of a Lakeland furniture store owner

[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:05.840]
Like Lakeland. Did he say yeah? Yeah, yeah, that's why you know when you see you see what happens when you kill someone in Lakeland

[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.160]
So you're right. Listen if you if you like spit at somebody in Lakeland, they fry it

[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.940]
Yeah, let this be a lesson to you you kids out there and if you go like more than five miles an hour over the speed limit

[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.120]

[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.780]
So I can't be at the metro zoo

[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.780]
Yeah, Ministeron Richard ministeron I heard his music is as good as his humor

[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.120]
He said that I know he's put something good show. He's great

[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.000]
Yeah

[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:54.260]
Music doesn't belong on his station, but he's great. No, that's that that shouldn't know better is a good it is a great record

[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.640]
I agree with you but didn't you say yesterday that uh

[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:02.920]
Doesn't belong on his station. I never said that yesterday. I said that about two days ago. Yeah, okay

[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:09.320]
No, I just want to get the day straight. No, the one the other one was a little more top 40s to me, but I should know better as a great song

[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.420]
And the more I listen to the other one the more things the fit in

[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.360]
Oh

[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.720]

Yeah, why why

[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.540]
We're zipping right through the calls today

[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:25.280]
You notice how many people have responded to the fact that we're like borderline music intensive today

[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:26.820]
Right on the edge

[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:33.240]
Just the way I like right on the verge, okay? So it's up to the audience. You know, let them decide

[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:39.680]
But you as army can train you to do things in six months that you could never do by yourself in six years

[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.720]
Matter hooking up a sophisticated telecommunication satellite system

[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.720]
The US army can train you to do the same thing in 20 weeks or less

[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:57.440]
Call your local recruiter for all the detain satellite systems all hooked up and ready to go general

It's a beautiful Tuesday the Sunday shining the birds are

[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:57.340]
And the audience absolutely is devastating this morning, aren't they?

[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.420]
Are they incredible or what that's the word brutal and devastating?

[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.140]
Too many old farts on the phone pump it'll be chill out

[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.920]

[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:53.260]
But what I want to see is the music's nice but I listen to you because I enjoy listening to you, Patrick. Hmm

[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.520]
Oh, you want to cut out the music and get back to what you do?

[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.780]
Well, what we usually do is we talk to the pubic. Okay, that's what we usually do, but last uh, I know

[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:03.860]
Last couple of days

[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.400]
Well, that was the idea

[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.640]
We want to get to talk to a lot of people

[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.920]

726 on zeta 4 now see now this way at least the lines go nuts when you do this because the people out there are massacres

[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:37.800]
They like it and much too nice on this show to the people. Okay, much much much much too nice

[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.820]
It's about time to get back to the old business and just to let them have what they deserve in this town

[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:47.100]
Well, they love it because they know that they deserve the punishment. They know they're basically this town is like a sewer

[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.160]
It's like the end of the world

[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:54.400]
Like I've said before if you took away the good weather what the hell would you have left here even the rednecks would get out

No, you're not thinking about him. You're thinking about Michael from

[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.520]
Pompato Park

[00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:58.620]

Either that or buying lottery tickets at seven level, but that kid I'm telling he is

What can't you kind of add live it? No

[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.320]
We have nothing

[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.780]
When you have no address and you have no copy and you have no information. I really kind of doubt it

[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.620]
Well, I could like after you're done talking about it. I could come in and at the end and say

[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.660]
Look for such and such in the yellow pages

[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.760]

Why'd she just hallucinating? Okay, it was just it was just a joke. It was just a joke

[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.260]
Oh, it's odd anyway anyway

[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.800]

[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.960]
Who live on the beach? I didn't say people live on a beach. I said the beaches did. There's some nice people who live on the beach

[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.480]
It's not the way it came across. And for their sake, I wish they could get out. Why are you sensitive and paranoid too?

[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:14.840]
I'm not sensitive and paranoid but yeah, I can't really call it how can you be calling collect if you live on the beach? Wait a minute

Yeah, it's that way, but that's only during the season. I mean

[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:35.920]
See when I was a little kid growing up, I thought that only Superman and Captain Marvel had blue hair and that's until I moved to South Florida

[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.460]
It's true

[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:46.640]
Well, I don't know you make it sound like everyone on the beach is all old and it's not that I didn't I didn't say that and I said

[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:52.420]
I have the greatest sympathy for anybody under the age of a hundred who lives on the beach. Oh you did say that. Yes, I did

[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:56.300]
I missed that part that's because we were trying to call I missed that okay

[00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:00.580]
Well, you see you have to get all the pieces of the puzzle to put it together before you start rushing to judgment

Oh, I'm sorry. No, this is listen is the first time I ever listen to your show. Are you serious?

I'm going to be a little bit more

[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.000]
I'm going to be a little bit more

[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.680]
I'm going to be a little bit more

[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.680]
I'm going to be a little bit more

[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.620]
I'm going to be a little bit more

[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.460]
if you want me back go do do do

[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.360]
but don't youme we'll grab you

[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.360]
if you want me back go do do

[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.120]
if you want me back goes do do do do do

[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.240]
what does that don't think

[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.600]
i want to mooooo mooooo mooooo

[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.340]
I love you

[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:25.360]
Yes, a little more wind, you went on your head, it makes me feel just bad.

[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:41.620]
I'm waiting my time, in my midnight confession, when I'm telling the world that I love you.

[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:48.620]
You want me to look at you, I just don't think I want you.

[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.440]
741 on Zeta 4, as we go music intensive, I really feel like it.

[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.840]
I'm right on the verge, you're just playing about 40 in a row.

[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:06.520]
But that'd be great.

[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.740]
It's different, I like it.

[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.260]
Yeah, I like it too, especially because the music is so good.

[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.380]
I realize that's just by accident, must be lucky, huh?

[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.280]
You know, really when you stop and think of it, how hard is it to program good music?

[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.140]
I hate to keep getting into that over and over again, but is it really all that hard?

[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.100]
Some people seem to have...

[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.240]
I have you noticed?

[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.620]
Oh, God, I can't believe you said that.

[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:31.140]
Well...

[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.020]
But I'm sure glad you did.

[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.400]
Anyway, listen, what the hell can I say?

[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.640]
I know from nothing, all I know is a bunch of old-eroy orbs and records, and I'm a daughtering old man.

[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.100]
And I don't know all these good, like ACDC and Queen.

[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.400]
Well, I do know a few creams, but that's...

[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:50.340]
Okay, 742 on Zeta 4, and just barely alive here this morning, but you never know it, would you?

[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.140]
Put not a good act.

[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.160]
Yeah, sure, right.

[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:54.720]
Miami, good morning.

[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:56.180]
Hello?

[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:57.100]
Hello.

[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.500]
This is OGIS.

[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.420]
Okay, well, that's close enough for us.

[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.320]
Yeah, this is Dr. Heckle and Mr. Sply.

[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.240]
Yeah, well, good luck to you.

[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:05.940]
Carl J. Michaels.

[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.580]
Okay, I bet he'll love to talk to you.

[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.800]
Yeah, we don't deal with those people.

[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:13.020]
Okay, with these amateur comedians, speaking of J.

[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.420]
Where are we going next to...

[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.960]
You never know when the next Robin Williams is going to be on that line.

[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:18.900]
Yeah, good luck to him.

[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:19.280]
Okay.

[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.900]
Or Joey Reynolds is the case maybe.

[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.800]
Yeah, it's the same character, isn't it?

[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.320]
Yeah, I think so.

[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.460]
Yeah, interchangeable.

[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:27.860]
What is that?

[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:28.400]
North Miami?

[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:29.180]
Hello.

[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:30.560]
Oh, no.

[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.600]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.040]
Broward County, hello.

[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.180]
It sounds like a lot of indigestion out there this morning.

[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.340]
Okay, hold on, no, go away.

[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.620]
Broward, hello.

[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.320]
Yep.

[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:42.880]
Broward, hello.

[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:43.940]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:44.400]
Okay.

[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.620]
Our first time caller.

[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.760]
Amazing part of it is those people are on hold.

[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.760]
That's the thing that I can't believe they're on hold.

[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.780]
Your show is really informative, man.

[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.540]
Yeah, sure is.

[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.580]
What are you learning from it, sir?

[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:54.820]
You said that.

[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:55.580]
You said that.

[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.740]
I can say that.

[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.780]
Yeah, but the caller can't say that word.

[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.700]
Now, that's a different S word, you know.

[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.160]
17 till 8 on Zeta 4.

[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.320]
Boy, have we got him this morning or what, huh?

[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.220]
Now, you know, they said that word on saying elsewhere in private time.

[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.020]
Well, good luck to him.

[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.100]
We're all going to sit on this show.

[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:15.500]
Okay.

[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.780]
Over my dead thing.

[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.000]
What was that?

[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:20.600]
Hello.

[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.040]
Hello.

[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:21.660]
Neil.

[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.100]
Yeah.

[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.020]
Listen, I got two questions for you.

[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.140]
One, who is the person that got you on FM?

[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.740]
What do you mean who is the person that got you on FM?

[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:30.940]
What does that mean?

[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.740]
I want to understand your other radio station on AM.

[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:37.360]
Was that your sister radio station or how did you get on the FM band?

[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.000]
That's in the same building, sir.

[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:39.860]
It's the same company.

[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.240]
It's right in the other end of the building.

[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.000]
Oh, isn't it?

[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.200]
Yeah.

[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.120]
Oh, okay.

[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:48.320]
No, the reason I say is because they did a real, real innovative thing with bringing you over to FM.

[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.020]
They did?

[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.280]
I'll tell you, coming home from work in the morning, it's a real joy listening to you because you just, you brighten me up.

[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:53.760]
Great.

[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.900]
I really enjoy your show, too.

[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.720]
A friend of mine, Larry, was telling me about a place called the Rascal House.

[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:00.120]
Yeah.

[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:01.780]
Don't ever go there, sir.

[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:02.240]
No.

[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.540]
Don't ever go there.

[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:04.040]
Why is that?

[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:08.540]
Because you'll just be overwhelmed by the barbarians online, Larry, sir.

[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.140]
And is it really that bad?

[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.240]
It's among place.

[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.700]
What was he, what was he telling you about it?

[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:20.040]
He just said they had really good corn beef there and it was, the waitresses were like 70 and older.

[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:20.500]
Yeah.

[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:30.080]
If you're willing to eat in a barbaric atmosphere with a bunch of hundred-year-old people standing online for an hour and a half, falling down from heat prostration, and I would suggest that's definitely the place for you.

[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:30.940]
Yes, there he is.

[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.420]
I'm serious, dead serious.

[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.880]
Oh, what would be a good place?

[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.000]
A good place for what?

[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.080]
Just some place to go.

[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.220]
That's not real crowded.

[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.180]
Just something good.

[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.160]
Well, you know, something that has good food and a decent atmosphere.

[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:40.440]
Yeah.

[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.540]
How about McDonald's, sir?

[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.080]
What is that about?

[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.940]
All over the good place to go.

[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.060]
There's hundreds.

[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:47.820]
Well.

[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.620]
745-004, I can't believe that call.

[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.060]
Can you?

[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.340]
That's speaking of good food.

[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:55.560]
The guy who loads up the machine is in the building.

[00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.480]
And I was wondering if you want me to get you some of those skeletons.

[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.640]
Now, one of those great Ville Parmesan sandwiches.

[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.560]
Or the scalloped potatoes and the can.

[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.760]
I like the bottom of the can.

[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:05.920]
It says in their own juice.

[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.900]
I like those mouse-meat Parmesan myself. Those are my favorite.

[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.960]
745-004, the near-roachers Tuesday morning show.

[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.700]
And these calls today on a scale of infinity have been minus.

[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.540]
Oral Gables, hello.

[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:20.500]
Good morning, Nail.

[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:20.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.140]
Good morning to your boys there.

[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.040]
I used to word loosely concerning the bird.

[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.860]
But hopefully I'm one of your...

[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.740]
No way, way, way, way.

[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:30.400]
The most good morning.

[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:34.300]
But listen, did you get a poster, a Jim Palmer poster, or the mail?

[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:35.120]
I hope not.

[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:37.540]
I sent it to you like last Wednesday.

[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.500]
No, I didn't get it.

[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.820]
And I'm hoping to put it off as long as I can.

[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.700]
What would I do with the Jim Palmer poster?

[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.560]
For a guy who's six four, he carries a water gun, believe me.

[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.460]
Believe me, Jim Palmer is exciting as a dead frog in heat.

[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:51.220]
Unbelievable.

[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:51.700]
Yeah.

[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.900]
Listen, one thing I heard, Lee Fowler yesterday, he was pretty good.

[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:56.960]
Yeah, he was okay.

[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.380]
When he does a funny show, he's decent now.

[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.360]
When he does those polls.

[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.760]
Yeah, I'll take you to getting a poll, you know what I mean?

[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:03.300]
Mm-hmm.

[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.520]
Well, maybe he's found a new niche for himself, sir.

[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:05.620]
Great.

[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.200]
And I'm a first time caller on the FM.

[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:07.800]
Great.

[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.580]
It was your number nine pledge on AM.

[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:10.100]
Mm-hmm.

[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.960]
On that famous one, that you made the announcement.

[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.260]
And I'm a lawyer listening to me.

[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:16.780]
Great.

[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:17.840]
That's a real job.

[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:18.320]
Okay.

[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:18.780]
Thank you.

[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:19.780]
Carlisogio next year, okay?

[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.820]
They denied 747 on Zeta 4.

[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:24.560]
There's an open line.

[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.500]
And Dade, 620, 3600.

[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:28.040]
That's flashing even as we speak.

[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:28.700]
Isn't that exciting?

[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.120]
Doesn't that motivate you to want to continue to at least about a quarter to 10?

[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.540]
This is like motivation.

[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.140]
I mean, we haven't heard of a show that ends at 10 past 10.

[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.240]
Now, how did that happen?

[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:44.600]
It happened because I was given the strong arm by Rose Folder, you know, like,

[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.380]
well, we're like dying in that hour.

[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.940]
We got to get you, we got to get some of your audience into that hour.

[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.060]
We're checking that AQH.

[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:52.520]
Make it true.

[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:53.380]
Yeah, AQH.

[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:53.860]
Q this.

[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:58.220]
Did you talk to him about that we started at 10 of six?

[00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.060]
No, he doesn't want that.

[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:03.540]
He just assumed give that 10 minutes up in exchange for the other 10 minutes.

[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.920]
But that's not what happened.

[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.340]
Did you know that it didn't?

[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:09.540]
Well, no, I figured as long as we were here, why did he give us give ourselves a break?

[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.700]
I heard he wants us to do like 10 minutes starting at two in the afternoon and then we believe again.

[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.640]
And then you're going to do four to six.

[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.240]
Four to six.

[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.440]
Did you get the memo?

[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:19.240]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:20.720]
I think that's tomorrow.

[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.120]
And then eight to midnight, I guess, we're going to run reruns.

[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.100]
Poppolo, hello.

[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:27.320]
A Neil.

[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:27.760]
Yeah.

[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:28.940]
My on.

[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:29.520]
No.

[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:33.940]
Dave County, hello.

[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:34.660]
Hey, Neil.

[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:34.980]
Yeah.

[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.720]
How's it going?

[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:36.620]
Real good.

[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.380]
Hey, well, we started rally against the FCC.

[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:39.820]
Neil.

[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.420]
Yeah, that's an innovative.

[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:44.700]
What an original idea that is, sir.

[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.300]
Hey, I mean, it worked for Howard.

[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.860]
Oh, yeah, Howard really did wonders with the FCC.

[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:50.360]
Yeah.

[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.520]
Howard's a douchebag, okay?

[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.660]
Why don't you get on the phone with him and tell him that in person?

[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:56.780]
I'd be glad to tell him that.

[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.680]
Because they won't put us on with Howard.

[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.860]
He's afraid to talk to me.

[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.120]
That's why because his friend Mitch up there keeps screening out the calls.

[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.420]
Oh, don't tell him that it's you.

[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.960]
Yeah, who are we going to tell him it is, sir?

[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:07.360]
Divine?

[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:11.600]
Yeah, I, I, for you know, I could have been anybody.

[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:12.700]
And you got me on.

[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.260]
What does that mean?

[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.380]
That means that just call them up and let's see you say that it is safe.

[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:20.480]
That's what it means.

[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.040]
Why don't you, this guy doesn't seem to understand.

[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.400]
Why don't you call him, sir?

[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:25.680]
Yeah.

[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:26.960]
You want the number?

[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.300]
Not at least a column.

[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:29.560]
Well, now you got to.

[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.460]
I'll get the rest of it against Howard.

[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.060]
I like Howard.

[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:31.580]
Good.

[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:32.920]
I'm glad for you.

[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.420]
Howard's funny.

[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.680]
He's funny on the air, but he's a douchebag, okay?

[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.040]
What about you?

[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:39.380]
What about me?

[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:40.460]
What about you?

[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.520]
What does that mean, sir?

[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:44.780]
You consider yourself special.

[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.020]
No, a special.

[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:46.920]
What does that mean?

[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:47.420]
Special.

[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.360]
Yeah, like a special douchebag, okay?

[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.060]
Well, this guy, I'm telling you, to consider yourself special.

[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:54.200]
Is the growth.

[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.760]
Yeah, that, that figures.

[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.160]
Yeah, that answers a lot of questions.

[00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:58.800]
Yeah.

[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.680]
But you always ragging on us, Neil.

[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.260]
On who?

[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.000]
On the growth.

[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.940]
I can't say on the air.

[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.020]
All right, Neil.

[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:08.460]
Okay.

[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:09.540]
Take care of yourself.

[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.420]
But it get the hell out of here.

[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.560]
I can't find Howard's number.

[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.280]
Maybe I threw it out and discussed it after our last attempt to get a hold of Bahawi.

[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:17.360]
Waste the time.

[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.300]
Was a waste of time because that douchebag Mitch wouldn't put us through, remember?

[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.560]
But you have any other interesting numbers there?

[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.980]
No, I'm not going to call any of these people.

[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.560]
None of those people are.

[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.700]
I don't know what this is.

[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.120]
Oh, God, I don't have a tape in here.

[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.280]
Really?

[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.420]
You won't need to take for this.

[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.620]
Just keep your finger on the button.

[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.360]
Look, the gate's opening by itself.

[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:49.740]
Wow.

[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:50.740]
By itself.

[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:55.680]
Boy, the technology that we have, it's just as nothing else.

[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.440]
We could only use some of it in here.

[00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:58.880]
It would be, you know.

[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.520]
Hi, this is Steve Perrin, program director of the new Y100.

[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.660]
Thanks for calling our ListenLight.

[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.900]
Together, we're making Y100 better than it's ever been.

[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.020]
Leave your comments at the comments.

[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:10.940]
You have to read it.

[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:15.040]
Thanks for calling and keep listening to the new Y100.

[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:23.380]
Hey, Steve, listen, two messages we want to leave for.

[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:26.300]
Number one, now seriously, number one, call us back when you grow up.

[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.880]
And secondly, we've listened to your station and it sucks, okay?

[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:30.940]
So.

[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.700]
Oh, you're amazing.

[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:40.180]
It's okay if you want to hear that bubble gum crap over and over and over again.

[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.260]
It's okay for like 12 year old kids.

[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:48.160]
Convicted murderer, William Jasperd-Darden has been executed in Florida's electric chair this morning.

[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.980]
He had maintained his innocence throughout his 14 years on death row,

[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:56.100]
during which he became the focus of an international debate on capital punishment.

[00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.220]
He was 54 and he was convicted of fatally shooting a Lakeland businessman

[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:04.080]
while robbing his wife of $15 in September 1973.

[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:10.260]
Michael Jackson canceled his sold out evening performance at the arena in St. Louis on Monday

[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.980]
because of Laren Gytis, the pop singers,

[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.540]
publics announced about three hours before the concert.

[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.740]
Michael Mitchell said that Jackson was suffering from a sore throat

[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.880]
and that ticket holders will get refunds.

[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.620]
Monday night show originally had been scheduled for Saturday,

[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:26.140]
then postponed because Jackson had a cold.

[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.480]
Oh, poor Mikey, huh?

[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.000]
He did perform on Sunday night at the arena.

[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:33.800]
I wonder if any of that ties in with the untimely passing of John Holmes.

[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:44.120]
A wine country high school has halted a 10 year tradition of giving commemorative wine glasses at the senior ball

[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:47.000]
because of a campaign against drug and alcohol abuse.

[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.220]
Students at Livermore, California will get Bud Vases instead.

[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.880]
A Bud, but the plan may backfire.

[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.980]
Kids are just going to take their Bud Vases after the dance and drink alcohol out of them

[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.880]
and laugh at the administration.

[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:05.520]
That's what senior April DeBose, a leader of the school's anti-drug campaign,

[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.580]
had to say about the Buds Bud Vases.

[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:14.520]
Sunny, Breezy, and Cool today will be in the upper 60s today.

[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.840]
Clear and cold tonight down to the 40s tonight.

[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:22.520]
And believe it or not, it's 53 degrees this morning at Zeta 4, 753.

[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.940]
755 on Zeta 4.

[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.340]
Got a question for you.

[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.080]
Got several questions for you.

[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.940]
Have you ever been turned down for a loan?

[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:32.100]
Yes.

[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.700]
Have you ever been denied a credit card?

[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:35.540]
I sure have.

[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.840]
Are you unable to get financing for a new car or home or both?

[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.240]
Well, once.

[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:44.080]
Have you ever been told that the bad credit rating will stay with you for seven years?

[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:45.720]
Well, I was told I had bad breath.

[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:49.800]
Well, that happens to be true, but it's not necessarily true about that bad credit rating.

[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.880]
In fact, if you've had bad credit, okay?

[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:54.140]
Okay.

[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:54.720]
Okay.

[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.340]
Got some good news.

[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.060]
Good.

[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.580]
I found our real estate and now now we can start being funny.

[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.000]
Okay, now the show starts.

[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.460]
We've got to see the reason we didn't really do much of a show this morning.

[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.940]
We didn't have any real estate to do the promo for tomorrow.

[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:07.500]
Okay.

[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.800]
And now that we have a real estate man from now here on until 10 past 10,

[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.260]
it ought to be phenomenal.

[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:14.460]
It ought to be sensational.

[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:18.640]
So now the good callers can start calling in and kept the name can stop feeding back at a mic in there.

[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:20.520]
Okay.

[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.280]
We got to do a show now.

[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.580]
Yeah, now we got to do a real show and not a pain in the butt.

[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.400]
Oh, God.

[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:25.900]
Okay, let's start with Pembroke Pines.

[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:26.860]
That should be a good starter.

[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.280]
Hello.

[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:29.520]
Oh.

[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:32.180]
Yeah.

[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:34.140]
That's what I mean.

[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.840]
That's what management always says to me.

[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.220]
They say you're the last smart ass wherever we're going to hire.

[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:43.440]
And I pull out my message that I got that they got really you.

[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:47.460]
Yeah, I pull out that message I got from John Donovan at WAVC in New York yesterday.

[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:48.700]
And they say, oh, we're just kidding.

[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:49.340]
We're just kidding.

[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:49.580]
Here.

[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:51.760]
Have another have another hot dog.

[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.300]
Neil, you know, come on.

[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:55.480]
You're really fun to listen to.

[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.040]
Well, that's good.

[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:56.920]
You have a nice day now.

[00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:57.300]
Get some.

[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:58.380]
Get some rest.

[00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:58.900]
Come on.

[00:41:58.940 --> 00:41:59.580]
Yeah, I will.

[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.160]
Soon.

[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:00.940]
Really enjoy it.

[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:01.800]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.820]
I'm going to turn on my recorder and try to catch a rest of the show when I get.

[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.380]
I want to wake up later on this.

[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:06.620]
Good.

[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:06.980]
Good thinking.

[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:07.280]
Okay.

[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.660]
We'll talk about you while.

[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:08.960]
Okay.

[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.640]
And I call you the next time I'm down here.

[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:11.500]
You betcha.

[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.360]
Let's talk until you have a good one now.

[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:13.920]
Bye bye.

[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:14.380]
Bye bye.

[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.360]
Good guy.

[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.820]
28 past eight on Zeta 4.

[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.280]
We have an open line in the Broward.

[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.040]
7779-3600.

[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.220]
See the thing that I don't understand.

[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:24.520]
We got all these people who want me to call them mung brain and douchebag and moron.

[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:26.000]
What is that all about?

[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:26.800]
They love it.

[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.120]
And in other words, they believe that honesty is the best policy.

[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.580]
I don't know.

[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.440]
Now, I don't see any food in this man's hands.

[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:32.740]
Do you?

[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.580]
I'm not even going to dignify him by turning around.

[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.040]
He was supposed to come in here this morning with a terrible feast.

[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.640]
He was supposed to have this place just hopping with the.

[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:41.740]
What about all those hot dogs I had here?

[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.880]
What about what what did that have to do with anything?

[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:47.420]
That was a celebration that was before the book came out.

[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:50.320]
Oh, that isn't that interesting.

[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.780]
Like he had the hot dog vendor here for the book.

[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:54.580]
We didn't I can understand.

[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:57.280]
I can understand if they brought joy hot dogs when the book came out.

[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:57.840]
That would fit.

[00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:58.380]
Okay.

[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.120]
That would be like an editorial comment.

[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.820]
Are you making enough noise in there?

[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:02.240]
Do you think?

[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:03.100]
My God.

[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:04.280]
Listen to that here.

[00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:05.360]
Let's do it in stereo.

[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.020]
There you go.

[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.000]
I didn't know that was our celebration.

[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:12.300]
Oh, the hot dog thing after the fact.

[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:12.760]
I think.

[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.640]
I think he could have stopped by Tom Thum and got us a little something.

[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:17.080]
Couldn't he?

[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.140]
Pigs knuckles like some of those pickled eggs.

[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.160]
Anything.

[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:22.320]
But they just don't care here.

[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:23.920]
This is your.

[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.660]
We don't give a damn station.

[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.060]
And here's a couple of.

[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.420]
We don't give a damn who.

[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:31.940]
Right?

[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:32.960]
Here's some traffic.

[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.720]
Okay.

[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:34.200]
Go ahead.

[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.340]
We care about those folks out on the high list.

[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:36.560]
We sure do.

[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.560]
We care about all you poor bastards out there driving.

[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.160]
But that's the way it goes.

[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:40.660]
Commercial.

[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.200]
Most of these are in our commercial boulevard approaching old Dixie highway.

[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.220]
There was an accident earlier.

[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:45.860]
They cleared it up.

[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.580]
But the traffic's still real bad eastbound.

[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:48.380]
How unusual.

[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:55.200]
And Southbound I 95 is backed up from an earlier accident from Oakland all the way to Cyprus

[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.040]
Creek Boulevard.

[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:00.080]
And the turnpike north and south.

[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.940]
And southbound lanes of the turnpike near Hallendale Beach Boulevard.

[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.100]
And the Hollywood Boulevard toll booths.

[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.300]
Most of those lanes are going to be closed today because they're repaping it.

[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:09.880]
Oh, yeah.

[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.420]
He's speaking of W ABC.

[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:14.460]
It's just done by me.

[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:19.120]
Maybe the guy was calling me for a reference on somebody that we all know.

[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:19.620]
Yeah.

[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.460]
It was it.

[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:22.240]
Yeah.

[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.320]
It's what it is because they would never hire me anyway.

[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.560]
They've been messing with my mind for about five years up there.

[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.680]
And they're never going to hire me because I, you know, won't.

[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.920]
I won't stand in line.

[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:34.980]
The look of relief on that man's face was just incredible.

[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.260]
Well, it could be a job offer you never know.

[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.440]
Okay, just but it also could not.

[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.220]
Seriously, it could be a reference on this guy.

[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.620]
I just want to put it.

[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:45.780]
How do I put it delicately if they're calling me for a reference on him?

[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:50.700]
I wouldn't be buying a house is I wouldn't be running a duplex.

[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.380]
I wouldn't be moving to fire Island to fire him.

[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.640]
831 on Zeta 4.

[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:56.680]
We have a caller in Miami.

[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:57.740]
Buenos dias.

[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:58.700]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.520]
First time caller.

[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:00.080]
Great.

[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:01.960]
I really enjoy your show.

[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.300]
Well, thank you, sir.

[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:04.780]
I'm a little nervous here.

[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:05.700]
That's the idea.

[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.480]
Well, I was wondering if you could help me with a particular problem.

[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.520]
I doubt it, but go ahead and give it a shot.

[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:12.960]
All right.

[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.040]
My sister and I have this child show.

[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:15.840]
Okay.

[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.840]
And it's pedigree with papers in the home.

[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.420]
I use only six months old.

[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.160]
And we can't keep them there.

[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.780]
We're trying to find a home for them.

[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.820]
And it costs about 300 bucks.

[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.300]
And we're going to give them away.

[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.540]
But we want to give them away.

[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.160]
If somebody is going to give them a good home.

[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.500]
But we're a little scared of some of the people out there.

[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.820]
You know, with these oldies, uh,

[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.740]
Santeria rituals and uh, bird, uh, dog burning.

[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.940]
Yeah, we got a house, we got a house right up on a corner here.

[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:42.220]
I think it'll take them off your hands.

[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:42.920]
Oh, really?

[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:43.280]
Yeah.

[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.620]
Well, will they burn them up?

[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:46.660]
No.

[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.480]
No, I don't think they burn them up.

[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.800]
They might slice them up a little bit.

[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:51.640]
Oh, it's got them.

[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:52.980]
Well, that's what we don't need.

[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.360]
Uh, and I was thinking maybe you guys are with us.

[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:59.720]
In fact, in fact, at the house on a corner right outside our gate here,

[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.540]
they give no meaning to the expression hot dog.

[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:03.240]
Yeah.

[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:07.480]
Well, uh, I was wondering if you could help us a lot.

[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.800]
What do you mean help?

[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.300]
In other words, we're going to do now pet giveaways on the air.

[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:13.580]
Next one, we do a lost and found.

[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.480]
We'll be doing a good job.

[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.280]
Next thing we'll be doing lost and found animals on a show.

[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:20.560]
So I mean, your intentions are great.

[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.480]
But do you think that we're going to give away the dog?

[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.280]
Well, how would we do that?

[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.220]
For example,

[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.220]
in other words, you give us the number to Captain Dave off the air.

[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:33.220]
And if somebody wanted a dog, they would call him and he would give them the number.

[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:34.680]
Something like that.

[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:35.080]
We know.

[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.620]
Well, I would be good if he was in the studio.

[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.580]
But he's up there.

[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:39.640]
I got no idea where the hell he went this time.

[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.000]
Wait, it's a good thing I got this apple.

[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:45.640]
No, I'm going to do it if he'll ever come back.

[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.000]
Let's just see how much time we can kill before he comes back.

[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:48.440]
Okay.

[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.300]
I think I got this apple.

[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.440]
This is our celebration.

[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.560]
Listen, I just want to tell you what.

[00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:01.420]
The membrane is definitely one of my strong words in my vocabulary nowadays.

[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:07.240]
I realize that those people out there do have a lot of mung brains out there.

[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.320]
Yeah, we can say that again.

[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.340]
So anyway, speaking of mung brains, where did this guy go?

[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.820]
All of a sudden, did he go into an eating frenzy or something?

[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.940]
The minute that the minute he saw a bulger come in here with no food,

[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:18.100]
he went to the machines.

[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:19.780]
He went diving out there to the machine.

[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:21.020]
You can bet your life on that.

[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:22.500]
You can back on it.

[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:23.020]
You'll come back.

[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.820]
He'll be eating when he walks back in.

[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:25.820]
Okay, listen, hold on.

[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.020]
No, don't go away.

[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:27.680]
Hold on, will you?

[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.240]
Okay, I'm going to put you on hold.

[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.960]
Don't go running off now.

[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:31.840]
I'll be really upset.

[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:32.680]
Okay, hold on.

[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:33.940]
Thank you.

[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.660]
Okay, now that's on line two.

[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.960]
26 till nine on Zeta 4.

[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.680]
If we can remember that long, it'll be great.

[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.240]
Seriously, he may be trying to set a new record now

[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.800]
for being out of the studio the longest time.

[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:44.800]

[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:46.940]
I mean, that's a lot of duties.

[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:47.700]
Like what?

[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.980]
Where I think that's one of the interesting.

[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.960]
Everybody else has got all these damn questions today.

[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.600]
That's one of the most fascinating questions.

[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.440]
Where does he go and what the hell does he do?

[00:47:58.560 --> 00:47:59.460]
Where is he?

[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.620]
He's busy at the machines.

[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.520]
First of all, it's time for a break.

[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:05.180]
That's number one.

[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:05.480]
There he goes.

[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.380]
I hear the door opening.

[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.340]
I hear he's frantic.

[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.180]
There he is.

[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:11.320]
He just came back from a rubah, I think.

[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:13.360]
Okay, now listen.

[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:17.320]
There's a guy on two who would like to give you his phone number.

[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.000]
No thanks.

[00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:20.440]
Well, that's beside the point.

[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:21.900]
You're going to take the guy's number on two.

[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:24.860]
And he's got some stupid dog that he wants to give away.

[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.880]
Oh, come on now.

[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:27.820]
The guy's a good guy.

[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.200]
Or, nearly, we don't do this because it's really it's juvenile

[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.400]
and it's embarrassing and disgusting, which means it fits the station perfectly.

[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.020]
This is like what they do on IOD.

[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.660]
Yeah, we're going to do lost dogs and cats and art varks.

[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:40.720]
Hey, that's Apple sounds really delicious.

[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:41.500]
That's some in the home.

[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:42.640]
I don't think so.

[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.400]
I don't think that an Apple on top of I don't think that's how I see it.

[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:45.900]
I don't think that's how I see it.

[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:48.780]
Oh, that would be the answer to my problems.

[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:49.200]
I see.

[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.840]
So anyway, if you take his number, if you'd be kind enough online to just write it down,

[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:58.660]
if anybody wants is interested in the dog, are you going to do it sometime this week or what?

[00:48:58.800 --> 00:48:58.960]
Yeah.

[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.720]
Okay, 836 on Zeta 4.

[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:06.340]
And I think while he's taking care of all that business, like BTO is that fine?

[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.580]
And we just play that a little while ago.

[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:11.240]
We'll take a little break and then we'll come back right after.

[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.680]
See now he's paying no attention.

[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.000]
He's paying absolutely no attention at all.

[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:17.600]
He's taking the number like you ask him to.

[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:18.640]
What was that number again?

[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.440]
Okay, we're going to take a break now and then we just.

[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.340]
What did you want me to take the phone call?

[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:23.920]
Uh huh.

[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:25.220]
Okay, well, let's just forget the break.

[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:25.560]
Okay.

[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.220]
No, let's forget it.

[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:28.000]
No, let's forget it.

[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.820]
Because I know you can't walk you to banana and chew it, come at the same time.

[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:31.220]

[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.920]
Are you through a little cloggle in there?

[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:38.200]
Yeah.

[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:42.220]
A lot of he's related to Jimmy Carter, buddy, chance or Chuck Doodle.

[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:44.040]
That was nice.

[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:45.420]
That was kind of interesting.

[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:47.440]
Well, we'll bring him back again a little bit later on.

[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:49.600]
Okay, Mr. Green Jeans in Miami.

[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:50.080]
Hello.

[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:51.560]
Hey, did you talk to me, man?

[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:52.120]
Yeah, man.

[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:53.080]
How's it going, Neil?

[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:53.480]
Okay.

[00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.180]
Yeah, we have a good time.

[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:55.580]
Love things.

[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.200]
I had a great time in Vegas, man.

[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:58.860]
I was coming out there probably next week.

[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.380]
Fantastic. Now listen, did you hear my restaurant that I recommended?

[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:02.200]
No, what is it?

[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.000]
Okay, I'm serious.

[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:03.940]
Did I like Italian food?

[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:04.400]
Yeah.

[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:05.500]
Okay, now there's a place.

[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:07.660]
It's not on the strip, but it's very close.

[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:08.920]
It's on Sahara Drive.

[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:09.720]
Mm-hmm.

[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:10.660]
And it's called Romeo's.

[00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:13.160]
It's a very elegant Italian restaurant.

[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:16.380]
I'm telling you, the food is so tremendous and the service is phenomenal.

[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:17.640]
And you'll love it.

[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.100]
It's called Romeo's Restaurant.

[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.920]
It's a 2800 West Sahara.

[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:22.540]
2800 West Sahara.

[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:26.040]
I'm telling you, it's really, it's, and you don't have the problem

[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:29.340]
like you do in the restaurants on a strip where it's all jammed up and crowded.

[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:31.520]
And you know, that gets real old after a while.

[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:32.660]
Yeah, it's only about it.

[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.240]
Listen about that guy that called it.

[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.060]
Had that chow-chow.

[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:36.560]
Yeah.

[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:40.660]
That dog, like I'm kind of interested because I got this big old labrador.

[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:42.480]
You know, and he likes to eat them like for breakfast.

[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.480]
You know, instead of chow-chow, it would be just chow.

[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.200]
You know, like puppy chow.

[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.000]
Yeah, something like that.

[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:51.840]
So, you know, I'll take the number for that.

[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:52.820]
Okay, great.

[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:57.600]
And, um, so, because, yeah, does lead Gillette work pants with really big pockets?

[00:50:59.360 --> 00:50:59.760]
Yeah.

[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.080]
I think it's a little bit too mundane.

[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:03.680]
He says, you know, you're talking about how much he likes the stones.

[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.900]
He says, I really feel deeply for the stone.

[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:06.920]
Yeah, that could be it.

[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:07.120]
Yeah.

[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.840]
You might have something there, sir.

[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:13.960]
However, federal law prohibits us from expanding on this conversation.

[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:14.720]
Okay.

[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:15.620]
Have a nice day.

[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:16.160]
Antonio.

[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:16.760]
Bye-bye.

[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.620]
And take good care of Lassie.

[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:19.220]
Will you please?

[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.000]
844 on Zeta 4, your doggy dog station.
