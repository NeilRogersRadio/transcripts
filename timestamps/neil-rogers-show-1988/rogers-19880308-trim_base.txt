[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940]
Today he's busy opening as a people's mail

[00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.500]
So my friend era is here with me this morning

[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.780]
Now pay attention Kinder Schwein because

[00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.780]
Frau ever has an important lesson for you all

[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.680]
On you will

[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.100]
Always raise the number boys and girls if you do see a very bad thing

[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.860]
And you don't tell such a

[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.020]
You could grow up to be president of Austria

[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.820]
Just like my children

[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.400]
I'll be

[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.200]
Be a fool

[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.400]
Your time is running out

[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.200]
What we will be back next week

[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.620]
And next year

[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.920]
And next thousand years

[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.560]
Because we are the master rice

[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.040]
One house and one rice

[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.400]
And the next one is forks forks forks

[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.620]
That's right kids

[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.360]
It's Mr. Waldheim's neighborhood

[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.340]
Everyone will be my neighbor

[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.660]
There's a little excerpt from that remake that they're shooting up on a four-letter-eal strip

[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.160]
Where the boys are

[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.440]
21 to late on Zeta 4 as we move right along

[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.060]
And we have another first time cooler in Broward County

[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.820]
Hello, how you doing?

[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.920]
How's it going? This is Danny electrician

[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.220]
Dave?

[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.040]
Dan

[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.580]
Dan

[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.120]
How you doing Dan?

[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.760]
Listen to the news last week that this is National Pro-Craft the Nation Week

[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.340]
We have a little thing on there about that

[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.440]
We have a little thing right

[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.020]
We did that last year

[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.160]
It's a real pain in the ass

[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.520]
I was wondering if we could possibly put it off till next week

[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.880]
Okay, so I was going to meet Dan

[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.840]
Okay, good talking to you, Neil

[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.800]
Okay, Dan

[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.980]
Okay, we'll see you later

[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:39.660]
Bye, boy

[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.720]
That's right, it is, Nash

[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.020]
Just a little humor there, right?

[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.340]
Yeah, that's a little

[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.920]
tiny, teeny, weeny bit

[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.760]
But it is, Nash

[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.840]
Of course it was Dan's first call, so what do you expect?

[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.240]
This is Rain and Man

[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.140]
I wanna ask you, have you ever seen Brian North Cross and Joe Johnson together with the same time?

[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.580]
I don't think so

[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.880]
I don't think so

[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.520]
I don't think so

[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.240]
I don't think so

[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.180]
Okay, by the way, the Oprah Winfrey Show today

[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.000]
will be featuring 17 of the weather girls

[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.560]
Each one looks just like Oprah

[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.660]
Amazing, this would remind you of that

[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.720]
I just, every time I hear that, I think of Oprah

[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.280]
I know

[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.260]
She wears tents

[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.040]
She wears these big flowing tents around her

[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.820]
But they make her look thinner, don't you agree?

[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.320]
Now, this is what I'm speaking of Oprah

[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.380]
This is what I want you to do

[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.020]
When you're in Windixie next time you're Windixie

[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.340]
I want you to walk around and look at the Mrs. Butterworth bottles of syrup

[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.120]
And tell me if that isn't the old Oprah

[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.180]
I'd be in 12th anniversary in the bag boys of public

[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.140]
I wonder why I don't have one of those from the bag boys that Windixie is

[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.840]
I'm not a public singer

[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.500]
It is interesting

[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.920]
But anyway, you check that out next time you're in the store

[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.640]
And you'll see, she might be getting royalties for those

[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.780]
I think that's an ethnic slur, my son

[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.940]
It is, but her worth is a white one

[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.580]
People from the NAACP ought to come in and be checking his out

[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.420]
Oh, is Mrs. Butterworth a...

[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.880]
Is she black?

[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.160]
She's a white-owned older white woman

[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.280]
Yeah, it's a brown bottle, so she looks

[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.540]
It's a brown bottle

[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.340]
Oh, so...

[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.380]
Yeah, and I guess Aunt Jemima be white too

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.480]
But you notice I didn't say go look at the Aunt Jemima bottle

[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.360]
I said look at Mrs. Butterworth bottle

[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.520]
I'm nothing to say

[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.100]
Oh, thank God

[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.320]
741 on Zeta4 and a Gator Bater

[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.940]
Okay, a Broward County, hello

[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.540]
Welcome to Sue Patu Nasey

[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.180]
Hello, are you there?

[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.940]
Yeah, we're here

[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.640]
Hey, do you know that?

[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.860]
I just can't believe you said that

[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.940]
I can't believe they call us

[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.560]
Do you produce a word?

[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.860]
Nothing, do you what happens to that?

[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.520]
Does anybody really care about this cast of misfits?

[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.580]
I couldn't care about that

[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.080]
No, neither could anybody else

[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.380]
Listen, I need a big fair, right?

[00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:02.600]
You smell really that big of fire

[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.800]
Oh my God, you're roommate

[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.060]
Our roommate needs an instant lobotomy, sir

[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.600]
There are a few people... sir, are you listening to me?

[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.380]
If you're taking the wax out of your ears

[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.580]
Okay, there are a few people who despise the Gators more than I do, okay?

[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.320]
They make me want a puke

[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.460]
Where would he ever get that idea?

[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.820]
Yeah, where did he conjure that up from?

[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.260]
Was that from the school of swishful thinking?

[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.980]
I have no idea

[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.080]
Yeah, probably

[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.400]
I think that the Gators sucked

[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.420]
Exactly, LSU whipped their butt the other day

[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.560]
Good, I hope they beat it by 85 points and ran up the score

[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.220]
I'd rather not be the East State that the Gators sucked

[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.580]
Guys getting very emotional on us, isn't it?

[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.720]
Well, if you see a talk about it, maybe I'll get it

[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.920]
I don't want to talk to your roommate if he's a Gator fan

[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.880]
I don't want anything to do with him

[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.480]
I don't want to be in the same building with him, okay?

[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.140]
All right

[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.140]
I don't want to be in the same state with him, okay?

[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.580]
Send the Gators to Mississippi, they belong over there

[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.000]
They're a bunch of redneck douchebags

[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.740]
Did that do it?

[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.420]
You did it well

[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.700]
Okay, I'm going to be dead

[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.020]
Okay, you too

[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.640]
I have a wonderful stupor Tuesday

[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.800]
Yeah, stupor Tuesday, I mean, any of you people out there are going to waste your time folding it

[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.400]
Why don't you get serious, okay?

[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.140]
I mean, what the hell difference is it going to make?

[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.320]
So the choice will be Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson in November, right?

[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.980]

[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.960]
And then you blame me

[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.780]
Oh, you know, we can all move to some wonderful country like Denmark

[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.340]
Or Holland

[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.400]
Thailand, I'd be happy there

[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.020]
Would you really?

[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.440]
Yeah, we drove by the Thai Orcad restaurant yesterday

[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.160]
Oh, didn't you?

[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.840]
I bet you were inside there when we drove by

[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.340]
No, I wasn't, but did you wave?

[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.640]
Yeah, we waved anyway

[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.500]
We said, boy, there's the bird right in there

[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.200]
It's supposed to be another block up the street with us at the melting pot

[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.140]
But he's an anti-social douchebag

[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.440]
I was busy

[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.720]
We don't want to hear about it, okay?

[00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.780]
We don't want to hear about your fantasies, you and your Phoebe Kate's pictures, okay?

[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.200]
All right, 744 on Zeta 4

[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.660]
And boy, he's, see, he never falls behind with that board in there, isn't that good?

[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.240]
I'm going to get rid of the screen, we can trade it out

[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.500]
Hollywood, hello

[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.900]
Good morning Neil, I'm a first time caller, I enjoy your show

[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:16.800]
Well, tremendously

[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.500]
Great, boy, we just have an epidemic of first time callers, this is exciting

[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.180]
Well, this is an epidemic, you know, people are beginning to ask why I'm always pulling for Neil

[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.520]
But that's something I have to work out, I guess

[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.760]
We don't want to get into that, Neil

[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.940]
Listen, what do you talk about everybody?

[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.540]
Show ratings and what's happening?

[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.020]
Where do you see radio in South Florida and say like three years?

[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.320]
Sir, you know where the tidy bowl of a man hangs out?

[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.440]
Is that bad, is it?

[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.300]
Oh, it's pathetic

[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.060]
I mean, there's nobody doing anything innovative or exciting or new or

[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.260]
This is just such a mong market

[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.580]
What is it, geriatric versus Hispanic?

[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.460]
Or is that what's lacking or happy to know what?

[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.180]
I don't know, I just lack of ballsy management people

[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.700]
I just all want to imitate each other and all do the same thing

[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.220]
And I don't know, it's just, it's stagnant, somebody needs to come along and do something revolutionary

[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.200]
Like maybe an all talk station on FM, that would be exciting and revolutionary

[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.160]
And it will, it's just something like that that would add a little bit

[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.580]
Now maybe even an English to start

[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.500]
It's a start, like a phrase

[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.960]
Well, anyway, listen, I enjoy you guys tremendously and the bits are fantastic

[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.400]
And I love the one about Stevie Nick, because I nearly drove off the road when I heard her digitally reproduced mumbling

[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.720]
Yeah, that was fabulous

[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.800]
Anyway, thank you guys

[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.900]
Okay, have a great day

[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.360]
Bye, boy

[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.300]
We got a lot of these good colors, first time colors, new voices, living and reading people

[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.740]
What the hell's going on here?

[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.140]
And did you notice how he controlled himself and didn't make a request?

[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.920]
Exactly, well, he gave a little hint

[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.100]
But that's good, you know, he didn't, he didn't see it

[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.560]
That is good, because I'm not going to play that anyone

[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.920]
I'm not going to play that anyone

[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.320]
Some day I promise you I'm going to play this all the way through

[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.120]
This is one of my favorite records, but this is in mono

[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.600]
And there's been too much mono

[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.520]
Can you just see 85 Oprah is dancing around like...

[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.680]
I can conjure that up in my brain

[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.100]
Intense

[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.920]
Mm-hmm

[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.720]
Mm-hmm

[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.540]
By the way, speaking of total adoosh bags, here he comes ladies and gentlemen

[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.620]
A rosefolder just drove in after goofing off her couple of days

[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:21.240]
He was at a human seminar yesterday, one of those places where they teach out to be a human being

[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.560]
And God only knows he needs a little bit of work, but he'll be okay

[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.800]
Is he still in the car?

[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:27.420]
Mm-hmm

[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.280]
He'll be alright

[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.800]
What is that noise I hear in the background?

[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.600]
What is that voice?

[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.480]
Is that Stevie Knox or Stevie Nicks?

[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.440]
Oh, is Stevie Knox called us?

[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.000]
Why?

[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.820]
I heard her on the ear yesterday, she's pretty weak

[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.960]
Is she really? Where? Where?

[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.320]
She was on last night?

[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.820]
Oh, I see, that voice is coming from in there

[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.520]
I thought that was just like an idle voice, one of those that kind of rings up and down the balls here at Zeta4

[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.040]
Seriously, they open that door in the atrium and all these voices that kind of like run away, they get lost in there

[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.480]
Like the voice of Christmas past

[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.500]
Mm-hmm, it's easy to get there

[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.600]
Or in this case the voice of Purim passed

[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.240]
I wonder how everybody enjoyed their home in Tasha, and hope everything came out okay

[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:09.020]
Well, you know those poppy seeds occasionally made you get stuck

[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.980]
Yeah, you didn't warn me about that

[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.320]
Okay, but like I said, no more food in the studio

[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.300]
Oh good, yeah, that's been kind of a little fruit once in a while, but no more food

[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.020]
Well, I'll bring something, I can bring that stuff

[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.040]
Yeah, and the donut yesterday was fine

[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.940]
No, no, that was too much

[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.640]
I like no more bagels, no more donuts

[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.800]
I like the bagels

[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.040]
No more pasta, no more pizza

[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.180]
Yeah, we did do it for a while there didn't we

[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.140]
No more tacos

[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.420]
Finally me

[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.920]
No more schmackos

[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.360]
No stone crabs

[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.460]
No stone crabs

[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.240]
No cakes, no puddings, no pies, no pastries

[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.980]
Can you make it clearer?

[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.720]
No hot dogs, no habitors, no cheeseburgers from Royal Castle

[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.840]
I got to keep a looking for a ring dang dude

[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.040]
No, no more ring dangs

[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.520]
Or wingsings or twinkies or yohos or yahuos

[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.220]
Now, so in other words, what you're saying is

[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.200]
Just so I'm crystal clear on these

[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.260]
Yeah, no more crystal hamburgers

[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.360]
You don't want any more food in the studio, right?

[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.260]
Yeah, right

[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.520]
Okay, thank you

[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.280]
Okay, I got it

[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.280]
I got it, clarify that for you

[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.620]
Okay, let's take a call from Miami

[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.480]
Hello

[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.860]
How are you?

[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.220]
Good

[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.940]
I just want to tell you thank you for last night

[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.080]
Is this Marlene?

[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:24.600]
Yes

[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.780]
Well, isn't that great?

[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.600]
Yeah, we're kind of quiet last night Marlene

[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.620]
Yeah, I know, I was, I was, I was welcome this morning, that's feeling too well

[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.880]
Oh, I'm sorry about that

[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.420]
I think I was catching a cold last night

[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.080]
Oh, I'm sorry

[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.160]
Well, that's okay, I was kind of like entranced anyway

[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.680]
How cold?

[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.180]
Oh

[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.420]
I mean, huh?

[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.260]
How cold?

[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.920]
Well, I don't know, I mean Rick kept the inching over and squeezing my knee

[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.120]
I don't know what he meant by that, but

[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.600]
Now it's just a joke Rick, okay, it's just a little joke

[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:49.920]
Yeah

[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.580]
Now, Maddie Lowe, I don't think she likes me

[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.200]
I don't know about her, I don't know if she does either

[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.880]
She's very quiet, she's either very quiet or she just doesn't like me

[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.460]
I don't know, I don't know

[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.700]
But it was a pretty good time, wasn't it?

[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.760]
Yeah, we had a nice time, we had a lot of food and it was so fat named

[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.060]
Yeah, and our waiter was, what was his name?

[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:11.560]
Rad

[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.600]
Rad was pretty interesting young man

[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.640]
Yeah, he was nice

[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.580]
He was very nice and Alan turned out to be quite an interesting caller

[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:19.720]
Alan?

[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.280]
Don't you remember Alan?

[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.660]
Don't you remember the two young guys from Cooper City, Ohio came by?

[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.700]
Yeah, the two kids from Cooper City, yeah

[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.140]
Yeah, and after they left you said, boy that Alan, I would do anything to kiss his mizuza

[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.320]
I did not

[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.800]
No, that's just, it's just a little joke, Marlene, come on

[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.140]
It's just a joke

[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.680]
But that's good, you're not going to have any food on a station meal

[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.460]
Yeah, I got to lose the weight, I got to stop this eating frenzy

[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.940]
You know, I mean, that was great last night, but now I have to take about a month's rest

[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:45.340]
Right

[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:45.940]
Right?

[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:46.440]
Yep

[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.720]
So how did everybody like it?

[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.820]
Everybody seemed to have a great time, enjoyed the food

[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.860]
Yeah, it was really nice, everyone came home though, that was so nice

[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.740]
Yeah, even Ricky said that, huh?

[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:55.300]
Even Ricky

[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.700]
Well, he's getting excited about my taking him to the track now

[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.860]
I'm going to be a step away from bankruptcy when I finish with him

[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.480]
Oh, kidding

[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.440]
Not like he's not already

[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.540]
Is he really?

[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.360]
I don't know

[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:05.940]
Oh, see this?

[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.380]
Hi Ricky

[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.180]
That's my tactics, see I take those young guys to the track and I get them to lose all their money

[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.700]
And then of course when they're desperate for bucks

[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.100]
Well listen Marlene, it's nice hearing from you

[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:15.200]
Okay, Neil

[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:15.940]
Have a great day

[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.140]
Okay, bye-bye

[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.400]
She's really great, that whole family just sits nice people

[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:20.880]
Mm-hmm

[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.400]
I can't begin to tell you

[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.920]
Oh, you're welcome

[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:32.340]
A 62 year old robbery suspect says he can explain why his fault's teeth were found on a Fort Lauderdale street

[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.480]
where an elderly woman was accosted

[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.260]
While he was trying to rescue the woman from the real robber

[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.780]
His teeth fell out of his pocket according to Joseph Bennett

[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.540]
Yeah, he was going to gum the robber to death

[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.480]
Fort Lauderdale police aren't buying the story

[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.400]
They have charged the Fort Lauderdale man with strong armed robbery

[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:51.920]
Unbelievable

[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.760]
And sure is yeah, I wonder if he left his polo behind

[00:12:54.760 --> 00:13:02.140]
His manager Bernard J calls Harris Glenn Milstead a lovable man hard working in a talented character actor

[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:08.180]
Defense though, Milstead is known as the outrageous campy 300 pound cult movie darling Devon

[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.140]
Why do you say is?

[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.060]
Did I say is?

[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.840]
Was, was, I'm sorry

[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.500]
His manager says Milstead was often hurt

[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:21.520]
Felt misunderstood when he read about himself in the papers described only as a transvestite star

[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:28.480]
As divine Milstead romped through such John Waters classics as Pinkful Mingo, polyester and the current release hairspray

[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.720]
The LA County Corners office says he died apparently by a fixation while he was sleeping in

[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.000]
I want

[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.540]
Fixation as

[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.800]
Fixation

[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.140]
As

[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:40.540]
Fixation

[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.540]
Hollywood sleeping in his Hollywood hotel room he choked in it. That's right. By the way

[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.240]
He was gonna appear on the Fox TV series married with children dressed as a man now

[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.940]
There no truth to the rumor that he found the other half of Mama Cassus Ham sandwich that is not true at all

[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.080]
Anyway

[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.620]
The vine was 42 and we'll miss divine yeah partly cloudy today the high

[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.560]
What do you never get appear on this show? No just mention that the high you know I want to rub it in

[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.660]
I think a Greg still trying to figure out who he is exactly

[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.260]
Well I feel like plenty of time to kind of sit back in

[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:19.660]
Today's high in tomorrow's high will be near 80 degrees and tonight's all around 70 71 degrees this morning at Zeta 4 and at 752

[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.040]
Neil Rogers the rock and roll monster

[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.640]
755 on Zeta 4 now if you watch the bold and the beautiful you'll see this guy wow whoever the hell he is

[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.960]
He's on a player album and for all three people out there who are middle players

[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.700]
Seriously he's in the soap now

[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.480]
Well, I'm sure Dennis Waters

[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:41.920]
Dennis Walter

[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.360]
We'll enjoy this all the more

[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:49.280]
Okay, ladies and gentlemen on that note I think it all speaks for itself. Okay. Just stop the ignition

[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.900]
Head for home my foot

[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:58.080]
Clock on Zeta 4 WZTA Miami Beach fort Lauderdale in a Palm Beach is everybody is cleared out which is excellent

[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:03.140]
Because I've come up with the new techniques. You one of the things when you're playing music even though this is not a music show

[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:09.460]
But back in my old days as a district he one of the things you do when you play music that you really get into is you blast the music

[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:15.240]
You turn it up your blast the speakers off the wall and I've come up with a great new technique now to enable me to do that

[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.080]
That is when a pan and he asks other people in the building come in here and start talking

[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.580]
I just turn it up louder now so that kind of like sends them out in the hall and

[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:28.340]
Get some the hell out of the studio not to mention any particular names. I don't want you to take it personally

[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:35.840]
I enjoy the music I know that Gonser probably is listening now can relate to that I want to be able to crank it up get into it and enjoy it

[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.420]
You know the feeling of the show that's what it's all about. I know and I don't mind going on music on

[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.540]
It's not a message for like the program director to come in here and start schmoozing around because he's got nothing to say anyway

[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:52.280]
Or anybody else in the building to come in here and start yeah, yeah, boys and I see yeah, I mean this is a radio show

[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.440]
This isn't like over the backyard fence. It isn't or is it

[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:04.120]
Let's see we did one idea, but I guess one good idea deserves another it's the Susan Martin radio

[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:13.800]
Thaw on WZTA Miami Beach board blotterdale and the Palm Beach's guess the Susan Martin radio

[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:20.560]
Thaw a non-profit four hours of the Neil Rogers show to raise money for a lobotomy for Susan Martin

[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.880]
And now here's your Jerry Lewis of South Florida Neil Rogers

[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.680]
This planet will self-destruct one minute hi, I'm so going to weaver from outer space

[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.600]
Listen up because I don't have a lot of time

[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:44.500]
45 seconds did you ever have that uncomfortable feeling in the pit of your stomach the feeling that something hideous and

[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:48.640]
Frightening is going on in there like something is alive and moving

[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.840]
And it will start coming inside

[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.700]
Oh my god

[00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:02.100]
Well, that's when I take new fast-acting alien self-serve

[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:06.880]
It neutralizes those nasty little acid base monsters living in your stomach

[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.480]
So go ahead eat that extra crab leg

[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.860]
Assuming of course that it is a crab leg

[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:20.560]
Because you got the fastest relief in the universe new alien self-serve

[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.240]
It's great for what's eating you

[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.860]
Okay, it's 802 on Zeta 4. It's kind of cute isn't it and I wonder what Ed thinks of that very much for playing that

[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.900]
I'm just really every team to me sure that other stuff

[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:46.120]
I think I did three in Miami before but I'll are you sure that's right?

[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.380]
Yeah, I think

[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:54.880]
No, no, no, no, one. Yeah, see I had a feeling Richard how you doing? Yeah, Neil how you doing pretty good Richard how you doing?

[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.080]
Oh, I'm alright just hanging out listening to the radio

[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.380]
Hey Richard, let me ask you a question. How you doing? Oh, I'm alright

[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.660]
Oh, I'm alright just hanging out by the radio

[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.280]
Listen Neil

[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.500]
Yeah, Richard, hey listen

[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:09.220]
Yeah

[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.860]
What are you doing today Richard?

[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:17.540]
Oh, hi, Bird, no one ever talked to you man. They always go anyways. Yeah, now they ignore me. Can you blame them?

[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.420]
You know, he doesn't have that strong hot-toe voice, you know

[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.560]
Like I do, I know

[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.640]
Yeah, you know, listen Neil

[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.240]
Yeah, you're a little wimpier. What's amazing?

[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.220]
You watched the Playboy channel last time. I don't have to play Boy Channel sir

[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.580]
I have American cable up in plantation. I have that fascist-minded channel. Oh, yeah

[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:39.900]
Yeah, that's a cable system where they give us the sunshine network with all the distorted pictures on it

[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.500]
Yeah, it looks like your picture tube just went out. Yeah, I want a bumper

[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.600]
You can say that again Richard

[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.040]
So listen Richard, let me ask you a question now that I'm thinking of it. How you doing?

[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.520]
Oh, I'm alright. I'm just hanging out by the radio. Oh, yeah

[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:59.160]
First and then what was on the Playboy channel last night was the Playboy Spring fling

[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:04.040]
And it showed Fort Lauderdale Beach, you know? Yeah, but there were people there I bet

[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:09.340]
Oh man, you should see how many people were there and they had these banners hanging out over the

[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.040]
You know, welcome students to Fort Lauderdale Beach

[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:16.120]
You know, they showed all the you know great action that goes on

[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.900]
It was really interesting, you know, to show what it used to be like

[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.140]
Yeah, really reminiscent isn't it? Yeah, right?

[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.980]
Yeah, boy, those were the days they still got a bit

[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.980]
Not for good, maybe if you had it you should have gone

[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.800]
No, I didn't have it last night Richard

[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.800]
I said bump for man

[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:36.680]
There were certainly some people around I would like to have had it but just doesn't work out. You know, it's still my life

[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:43.840]
Yeah, listen, I get my roommate here seeing how we're doing this so well he wants to talk to you about your range or something about how far you get out

[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.640]
About my range? Yeah, just that one caller tall down

[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.920]
Yeah, which burner is it that he's interested in?

[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:49.160]
Richard

[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.040]
Radio

[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.740]
The radio station as that one caller said down to that

[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.360]
So where is he Richard?

[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.540]
He's sitting right here, you want to talk to him? I guess

[00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.480]
Okay, so he's towards

[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.680]
Yeah, okay

[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.720]
Hey Neil

[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.900]
Hey George, how you doing?

[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:07.620]
Okay, listen, your radio, yes, your range of radio gets out

[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:11.160]
We've picked it up as far going up 27 into more haven

[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.920]
Wow, that's right

[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.540]
I thought about that time what happens is that 95 Y and F and Tampus start to go

[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.140]
Oh yeah, they were operating on the same frequency

[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.540]
Yeah, we're going to knock those bastards off the air, okay? They're in the barn, yeah

[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:29.680]
And that's, I can't tell you how far west but I don't think it up in more haven

[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.600]
You picked it up in more haven, I'm hoping you can get rid of it in South Florida

[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.700]
And then there's the real interesting one is this 50,000 watt

[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.820]
Both torches that you're operating next door there

[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:42.960]
Yeah

[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.980]
Just before they get to the nighttime pattern in the twilight

[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.520]
Yeah

[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.200]
It runs real havoc with M.A.Z. up and making when you get up around Pensacola

[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.140]
Really? Well, that's incredible

[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.100]
So I just figured you'd let you know

[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.500]
I bet you all those people in Milton will love Stan show

[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.640]
Yeah, right

[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.100]
Okay, have a great day, but

[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:10.940]
Okay, George, by the way, if you just calm yourself down please just try to control yourself

[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:12.940]
Mm-hmm

[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.180]
Okay, this is such a frightening control now

[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.240]
It's just a frightening car

[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.360]
I know the Stan Major show in Milton, Florida

[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.960]
You boggled my mind, Neil

[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.620]
Yeah, it stands down to a two in Miami but he's got a 17-share in Milton

[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.960]
And he's big in two egg

[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.620]
Yeah

[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:31.180]
Are you going to do the weather? You're going to drink the coffee or want neither of the above

[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:35.760]
Partly cloudy

[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.400]
Maybe we can get her on a recording to do the whole weather then you wouldn't have to tax yourself

[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:39.840]
Sorry

[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.120]
Hi, today in the morning, I'm AB

[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.080]
We'll follow our insurance on price

[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.540]
And load it at about seven

[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.600]
What a great recording Dave

[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.840]
Please, when going hard

[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.000]
How much will this cost us?

[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:48.940]
Three degrees

[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:53.860]
73 at Zeta 4 and it's almost seven past eight

[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.820]
Eight minutes to have to rate and don't forget, the colder is open now, tropical at cooler

[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.720]
And today is what? Tuesday? That means they're racing at colder at one o'clock today

[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:10.780]
And every day, Tuesday through Sunday and tropical at colder of course offers you an opportunity to get out, plunge your brains out in real relaxing style

[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:17.080]
You know, we could look from here, we can see the Robbie Stadium right from here and we just know that right next door to it is colder

[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.420]
And it really is my favorite track, not that I make any money there, don't get me wrong

[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:26.480]
But I just have a good time and you will too because you'll enjoy the laid back atmosphere and of course the great racing

[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:32.460]
And a good food all through the track now, I have to say this in all honesty, many of the paramutual plants offer you food

[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:36.380]
That is less than outstanding, okay? Is that a very diplomatic way to put it?

[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.300]
But at Calder, no matter where you eat, whether it's in one of the dining rooms or whether it's up there

[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:45.400]
And I see where I like to go, is up on the roof, the roof garden where they have those delicious deli sandwiches

[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:50.020]
The pastrami and corn, beef and Martha makes all those phenomenal sandwiches for me

[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.340]
And you know, you get your big pickle there, which is always exciting to me

[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.980]
And it really is great, you're going to love Calder

[00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:00.620]
And if you know, it's interesting Rick said to me at the melting pot last night, he said, you know, I asked him, you ever go to the track

[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.460]
He said, well, I went a couple of times because I heard you talk about it and plunged my brains out

[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.160]
And I said, well, you got to know what you're doing

[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.260]
Good idea

[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:11.640]
So if there are any budding young would be horse people, and of course they have to look like Rick

[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:16.180]
But if they're in that same general genre, I'll be more than happy to show him how to read the racing form and the program

[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:21.400]
And get the scratches off the board and hear Phil Saltsman screaming and wailing upstairs in the whole business

[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.180]
Well, can we? I'll be delighted to do that

[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:28.320]
I just like to tag along and I said they have to look like Rick, okay? Not like Frankenstein

[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:34.440]
Don't forget racing today and every day Tuesday through Sunday, tropical of Calder post-time 1 p.m.

[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.420]
So does that mean no? We can't

[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.800]
You wouldn't say nothing, we just be kind of like behind you just tell you

[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.320]
Ten minutes past it on Zeta 4, we have a lively Canadian, it says hello

[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.460]
Hello, who's this?

[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.300]
Who is it?

[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.620]
Yes, who is this?

[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.540]
Why is she pooping?

[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.480]
I've been waiting on the phone for a hour, we're waiting here

[00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:04.340]
At the corner of Northwest 2 Avenue and Northwest 207, I am now the official president of the Canadian Neil Rogers fan club

[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.520]
Well, that's marvelous sir, like I said, I knew this was a great job

[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.640]
I think I've been working so hard

[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:17.240]
I'm 97 power and I'm the president of your fan club and I got a forest here and I'm lost and I got a present for you

[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:17.780]
See you really?

[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.980]
Oh yes, all the way from Toronto

[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.020]
Wait a minute, I'm on the plane

[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.820]
Wait sir, take a breath, okay, take a breath

[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:25.580]
Now

[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.320]
A breath, I'm tired, I'll be waiting, how do I get to your place?

[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.480]
What does he just say?

[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.500]
He's on the corner of 207th Avenue

[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:32.940]
And 2nd

[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.440]
I'm at the corner of Northwest 207 Street

[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.540]
And Northwest 207 Street

[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.820]
Okay, first of all, we're not on 207th Street, we're on 207th Drive

[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.020]
Okay, can you see the school from where you are, the elementary school?

[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.580]
No, I see a guy in the water, what are you talking about?

[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.680]
Now he's in the wrong place

[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.800]
He's not really out of the picture, he's here

[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.600]
I'm in the corner of my mind, get to the front

[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.200]
Sir, let me just suggest this thing

[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.740]
You're a lot, you're east of where we are, okay, we're way out west

[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:02.080]
We're out near the turnpike, now don't start crying on us, okay, no

[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.380]
Canadians tend to cry a lot, but don't start on us, okay?

[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.200]
Don't start squirting on the air, please sir

[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:10.380]
Where do I go?

[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:11.340]
Where do you go?

[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.540]
Tell me that like that, but where do I go to get to you?

[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.940]
He wants me to give him directions on the air, how to get here, oh my god

[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:22.360]
I thought why the guy hung up on me, just wait a second, I said no, just one direction

[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.200]
Go north to what?

[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:27.040]
No, no, I'm a northwest 207th Street, northwest to Avon

[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.220]
He was talking to me for like 30 seconds and I was trying to go okay, okay, hold on, he was like go for ever

[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.440]
Wait a minute, just a second here sir

[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.640]
He's trying to say that I hung up on you

[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.060]
And this is how you get the president of your family, come on

[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.620]
Sir, let me ask you something, there are thousands and thousands of people listening

[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.940]
This is a radio show, we're here to try to entertain the audience, not to try to give directions

[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.720]
He's a lost Canadian

[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:56.180]
Just think of the man who picked up the phone before, because I just said, unquote, I just want to get directions to your station to surprise the awardgers

[00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:01.100]
And he said, hang on, and I've been hanging on for about half an hour

[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.180]
He never heard you say that sir, he doesn't know what the hell you're talking about

[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.740]
He doesn't know what the hell I'm talking about

[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:06.700]
That's what he just said, yeah

[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.020]
I said I had something drippy in the west

[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:09.820]
Yeah, he said that

[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.600]
You have something dripping in wet, well sir, put it away, will you please?

[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.980]
What an disgrace, I can't believe he said that

[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.620]
What do they think we're doing down here?

[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.860]
Oh, these Canadians boy, they got some kind of flip-spot or what?

[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.020]
It's 8-12 on Zeta 4

[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.340]
I cannot believe that he said that

[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:31.260]
By the way, today is stupid Tuesday and in keeping with the spirit of the day

[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.180]
Oh, look at what you did to this, where did you go?

[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:38.040]
Mommy, you stopped that fighting right now

[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.060]
Mommy, runny hit me

[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.360]
That's because he hit me first

[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:43.960]
Did not

[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.700]
Did too

[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:50.880]
These kids today, are giving countries to play with and they just don't appreciate it

[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.700]
You're a big liar, right?

[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.560]
Well, you're a mad doggy, momar

[00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:57.900]
Maaaah

[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.080]
There you go again, always crying from mom

[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:05.820]
Oh, sometimes they make me so mad, I wish I could just slap them silly

[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.340]
I'm not scared of you, I got friends with me and so

[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.680]
Will I don't care because my gun's bigger than your gun?

[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:18.000]
This mother's day, I just hope they think of me

[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.740]
Don't you tell me about public service message from Mother Earth?

[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.220]
Don't you tell me?

[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:29.060]
Okay, so that on the motivation to get out here and get involved in stupid Tuesday, shouldn't it?

[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:30.100]
Yeah

[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.940]
Anybody out there voting for Ducaca today?

[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.500]
I am, are you really?

[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.760]
Well, good luck to you

[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.980]
Our next president ladies and gentlemen and the first lady, Kenny Ducaca

[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.960]
This is going to be like flashback to the 16th

[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.120]
Answering the musical trivia question, can Kenny Ducaca?

[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.780]
Okay, okay, moving right along, that Canadian guy got me really upset

[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.380]
What the hell is his problem anyway besides being lost?

[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.880]
I'm in the same direction as back to Toronto

[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.740]
Now I think it's fascinating we had the tape of your, with you with another Canadian

[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.700]
That's after he called after that

[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:10.840]
And I think it was the same guy, I mean, it's just a feeling I have in my bones, you know

[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.540]
Ladies and gentlemen, it's a public service

[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:25.560]
WZTA radio is beginning the collection fund to send all French Canadians back to Montreal

[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.880]
And all English speaking Canadians back to wherever the hell they came from

[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.420]
I bet that guy was calling from Maple Leaf Gardens

[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.580]
It sounded like one of the Maple Leafs to me

[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.320]
Need to

[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.200]
Well Pacquiao sandwiches, okay?

[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.340]
Will even make him Canadian bacon

[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.520]
What the hell is Canadian bacon by the way?

[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.140]
Well, it's just a, I've had it, it's just a different, different cheaper

[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.280]
No, no, it's not cheaper

[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.840]
Oh wait a minute, Figuero is on the line

[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.580]
Okay, get him

[00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.060]
No, it sounds like Figuero's union

[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:02.400]
No, it's Figuero, I'm telling you, I can, that's Figuero, put him on hold immediately

[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.180]
You can't tell Figuero when you hear him

[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.060]
No, that's not him

[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.000]
Yes, it is, one line

[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.700]
Oh, that's Figuero

[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.200]
Figuero

[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.940]
Oh, it sounds like a Muslim

[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.140]
That's not Figuero

[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.920]
No, it's not Figuero, you're right

[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.920]
Well, for the Dorees sounded pretty good

[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:21.920]
Thank you

[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.300]
Figuero, Jr.

[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.060]
Yeah, is this Figuero, Jr. Jr.

[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:25.140]
Figuero, Jr.

[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.080]
He's singing something he's singing from a minaret

[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.700]
He is working up to it, don't you, isn't he?

[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.080]
Mm-hmm, he's all right

[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.400]
So who are you looking for Figuero?

[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:34.780]
Figuero, Jr.

[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.720]
Good, go sick, I'm Figuero, good luck to you babe

[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.960]
816, on Zeta 4, there's an open line in date

[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.860]
And if there's any cheap French Canadians out there

[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:49.160]
We have a little message for you from all of our good friends in South Florida radio

[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.540]
Go to hell back where you came from

[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.060]
Get out of our lives

[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.420]
Put driving two miles an hour out on the expressways

[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.820]
You maniacs

[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:56.600]
Oh man, I really don't know

[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.400]
They make me nauseous

[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.000]
All you've got to do is see a Quebec license plate

[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.060]
And you immediately know, man, you're not going anywhere

[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:01.800]
Mm-hmm

[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.840]
But I like the one thing that they do

[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.000]
They do is when they change lanes and they turn on their signal

[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.380]
They like to leave them on

[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.000]
And I like that, that's a good idea

[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.340]
Yeah, just so I think

[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.560]
In case you missed it the first time

[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.460]
Exactly, and I think it's a great service

[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.580]
Well see, they're conserving their physical energy

[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.740]
So they're so damn cheap

[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.380]
They don't even like to waste physical energy

[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.420]
Because you have to reach over and you know, make a little yank

[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.700]
Just a little yank to shut them off

[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.100]
Uh-huh

[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.300]
When I was after I landed at the airport

[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.200]
I hadn't been back in town for 10 minutes

[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.040]
And this guy was in front of me at a light

[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.580]
Decided he wanted to get back on the interstate

[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.920]
The light turned green

[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.060]
He started crossing across three lanes

[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.160]
Oh yeah, all these cars were honking at him

[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:39.900]
He was blocking drivers

[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.560]
Great idea

[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.200]
Yeah, good idea

[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.800]
Here's Chris Cross on Zeta 4

[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:44.580]
That was great

[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:48.260]
Okay, it's 817, we have a first time caller from West Palm Beach, hello

[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.660]
Hello Neil, how are you?

[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:50.600]
Good, how are you?

[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.120]
You know why that French Canadian was calling from 207th Street?

[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:53.940]
Why is that so?

[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.760]
You only 10th cent fall in South of the world business

[00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.880]
I believe it

[00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.900]
I believe it

[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:00.320]
I believe it

[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:00.500]
I believe it

[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.200]
And he was using it

[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.000]
I'll leave that part in North-Western, let's just go to Toronto and save everybody a hassle

[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.920]
He was using two wooden nickels on his stand

[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.200]
Yeah, yeah, he rubs them together

[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.860]
He's trying to make a fire if he couldn't do anything else

[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.420]
Exactly

[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.780]
Hold on a second

[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.080]
Somebody else must say hello to you

[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:12.580]
Okay

[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:14.620]
Hello, Neil

[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:15.420]
Hello

[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.900]
First time caller

[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:17.460]
Great

[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.620]
Two-month listener

[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:19.220]
Good

[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.300]
Excellent show

[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:20.740]
Right

[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:21.600]
I enjoy it

[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.900]
New York, California boy

[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:23.520]
Yeah

[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.600]
One in your top

[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:25.460]
You're right

[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.140]
All right, it cost me 45 minutes on the line here

[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.860]
New Cho's in the arrow

[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:30.440]
Yeah

[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.420]
What do you think?

[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.760]
But at least you're not one of those cheap French Canadians, right?

[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:34.760]
Oh, not at all

[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.300]
Send them back when they came from

[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.780]
I tell you, those dudes back in little bit, you know what I tell you

[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.720]
I believe it though

[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.080]
Yeah

[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.220]
I have to tell you a little stories

[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.580]
The other night I went into a bar

[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.800]
I bet you did, yeah

[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:50.440]
The West Palm

[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:51.580]
Celebrations, right?

[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.060]
And there was a Polish guy

[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.880]
And he looked at the end of the bar and it was this beautiful girl

[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.820]
But he didn't have the nerve to grow up and talk to her

[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:02.840]
But now a lady I saw him, he was drinking beer and he got the nerve

[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.620]
He went up to her and says, you know I've been looking at you all night

[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.500]
And you're simply gorgeous

[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.000]
I would love to take you home and have mad passion

[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:11.880]
Exactly

[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.580]
The girl says that sounds so nice

[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.380]
But I'm on my menstrual cycle

[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:20.060]
So the Polish guy says, don't worry about it, I'll have my luket out there

[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:20.940]
But I'll follow you

[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.220]
That's too bad

[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.100]
Pretty cute

[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.320]
Okay, but don't ever call her again, so we don't do jokes

[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.200]
So we liked it

[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.340]
It was cute, but we don't do jokes, okay sir

[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.380]
Oh my god, now that was cute though

[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.360]
There was a lot

[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.220]
In fact, he could call back and tell it again

[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.480]
We have an open line in Broward at 7779-3600

[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.660]
7779-3600, I guess time to talk about the pot, right?

[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.200]
Good time

[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.860]
Yeah, it's a good time for the great taste

[00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.940]
The melting pot, and again, my thanks to Dana and Brad, our waiter

[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:54.180]
Our terrific young waiter who tried desperately to spill one of those drinks on me last night

[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.820]
But didn't succeed, listen, he could have spilled anything on me, it would have been alright

[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:03.800]
But anyway, if you want a fantastic meal, nice atmosphere, reasonable prices

[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.820]
I mean, the food is so good there that everybody just gets like spastic

[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.380]
They really do, they start raving and dripping and drooling

[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:13.120]
And Ricky's family was just orgasmic, they really were

[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.360]
In fact, I was kind of embarrassed, they were all just rolling around together on a table

[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.420]
But we had a sensational time last night, and you will too

[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.340]
And they're not three melting pots, we should mention that

[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.540]
Of course, the brand new one up in what they call West Palm Beach

[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.360]
But you can bet your life on it is Lake Ward

[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.700]
It's at 30, 44 South military trail up in Palm Beach County

[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:35.240]
And of course, the same delicious fondue, the great Swiss and cheddar cheese appetizers

[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.640]
And delicious beef chicken and a seafood to dip in a peanut oil with all those seven delicious sauces

[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.440]
And then of course, the dessert

[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:47.000]
No matter what it is, I should also mention the chef salad with delicious honey mustard dressing

[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.360]
But the highlight of every meal at the melting pot is that dessert

[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.140]
The milk chocolate and the white chocolate with amaretto

[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:56.100]
And last night as part of the birthday celebration, Rick did stand up

[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.760]
And did dip that banana in the white chocolate

[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.120]
And everybody at the table was just owing and I

[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.580]
And it was astonishing, I was just breathless

[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.040]
And you will be too when you eat at the melting pot

[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.800]
It's as good as it gets, I'm serious

[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.220]
And if you've never had fondue before, you're in for a real tweet

[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.720]
As they say in Birdland

[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:17.240]
I shouldn't even dignify you, you know, you shine this last night

[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.860]
The food was so good, we had a great time

[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.380]
But you know, nobody missed you

[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.700]
Anyway, as I said, there are three locations

[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.680]
There are a mile west of university driver

[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.160]
Just east of Pine Island road on sample road in Coral Springs

[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.220]
Where big day views to work

[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.100]
They newly expanded location to 98 35 Sunset Drive in Kendall

[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.880]
Where we had that magnificent meal last night

[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.400]
And the brand new melting pot

[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.380]
3044 South Military Trailer West Palm

[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.860]
Now I do mention that reservations are strongly suggested

[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.920]
So since it's already Tuesday

[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.060]
Oh, seriously, if you have plans coming up for the weekend

[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.220]
You probably ought to call now for like Thursday, Friday, Sunday

[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:49.720]
That's a great idea

[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:50.900]
The pot

[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.500]
It's a 21 past eight on Zeta Ford

[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.160]
Did you, you got a mobile on two?

[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.280]
Did you want me to do this for?

[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.320]
No, I'll do the mobile first

[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.000]
Whatever the hell you want, Captain Dave, hello

[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.100]
Hello, Neil, how are you today?

[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:00.340]
Good

[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.240]
As the listing, there's a reason why the birds shine

[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.740]
And I think that Angela, I think that

[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.940]
And Glenn can congratulate her

[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.500]
Because last week we were talking about

[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.660]
I mean, Jewish by association

[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.780]
And I want everybody to know that

[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.320]
That Glenn became Jewish by injection last night

[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.200]
So my little Yiddish, your bagel, look, congratulations

[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.540]
Of course, the bagel is a bird and Yiddish

[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.280]
Right?

[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.080]
So you want to take that break down on Zeta Ford

[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.500]
I think it's time to take that break

[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.920]
Okay, whatever you say, it's 23 past eight

[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.400]
On Zeta Ford, Gondzers, Grill today at noon

[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.160]
On the Jeff Gondzers show featuring

[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:38.280]
Yes

[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.020]
Neil Young

[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.000]
Neil Young

[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.200]
E-L-O, that's a good one

[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.460]
And Van Halen

[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.580]
So that's coming up a little later on today

[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:50.900]
You sure you're going to want to miss that

[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.480]
Okay, now listen, something we have to have

[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.400]
Miguel here, by the way, I see a truck out there

[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.040]
I'm not sure

[00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.860]
Because I want him to make a personal delivery now

[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.340]
You, of course, don't watch those soaps

[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.140]
But this douchebag here on the left

[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.120]
And this picture on the front of the player album

[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.320]
Player Danger Zone, that's the one that's in the soap opera

[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.080]
Wow

[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.440]
In fact, he's probably on this album too, is there a picture?

[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.840]
Yeah, it's just a...

[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.580]
This is a football here, yeah

[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.800]
He's on the bull in the beautiful

[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.100]
I don't really give it damn how old he is, okay?

[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:19.960]
Because he's a mung brain

[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.660]
And that's a bad show anyway, that shows like a filler

[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.200]
It's between the young and the horny

[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.760]
And what's that other show? Is the world squirms?

[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.760]
Yeah, is that the one that Dusty is on Brian Bloom as he on as the world turns?

[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:32.940]
I know, I'm...

[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.060]
Come on, now you're supposed to roll out of my area

[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.320]
I just... these soaps, you know

[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.480]
I'm sorry

[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.200]
The soaps are going to be really hurting from the writers, right?

[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.320]
Possibly

[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.800]
That's all right, they'll make it up as they go along and they'll probably be better

[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.780]
Yeah, probably well

[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.380]
In fact, if they do it extemporaneously, maybe they're actually...

[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.180]
If they would only do them live, it would be great

[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:51.180]
Like they used to

[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.720]
Because then they might get a little bit excited, you know

[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:56.040]
They might get carried away and forget that the cameras are rolling and that would be good

[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.780]
Anyway, it's 825 on Zeta 4

[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.840]
And there was something else I wanted to do

[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.260]
I want them to go to deliver those back to that lady in Hollywood, that's not that far away

[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.800]
She called earlier, but she couldn't hang on, so she hung out

[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.900]
Oh really? But that...

[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.860]
Barbara, we're sorry that we couldn't get to you, Barbara

[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.420]
You're a great American, Barbara

[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:16.040]
She is, but I want him to deliver those personally, because I don't want to put them in the mail

[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:16.520]
All right

[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:21.980]
Because they'll either get stolen or be, they'll break both of them by the time they get to Hollywood, okay?

[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:25.300]
Because not that we don't love our friends in a Carol City post office, bless them

[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:26.880]
But...

[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.160]
I think their favorite group is the staple singers in that area

[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:34.440]
Boy, I never forget that period of time when we used to have money and cash and everything coming into mail

[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.840]
And like half of my mail would be stapled closed again

[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.160]
Opened by mistake, in fact they didn't even put that stamp on there

[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.760]
You know, they were too busy opening the next one

[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.140]
Anyway, so just a little pointer, don't mail your mail in the Carol City post office

[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.320]
Okay, boys and girls, if you want to get it to the other end

[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.900]
Let's take a call from the Port Waterdale, hello

[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.680]
Yeah, Neil

[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.800]
Yeah, my name's Vinnie, I'm from Brooklyn

[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.200]
You're from Brooklyn, Vinnie?

[00:37:59.480 --> 00:37:59.660]
Yeah

[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.040]
Great

[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.460]
Hey Vinnie, Vinnie

[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.060]
What kind of a lousy phony accent is that, Vinnie?

[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:06.540]
Come on

[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:07.380]
Okay

[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:08.580]
Yeah, come on

[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.880]
You can't fool, you can't...

[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.180]
It's kind of making a scene

[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:11.840]
You can't...

[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.660]
I have to deal with the people I work with

[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.400]
You can't be S-A-B-S-E-R, Vinnie

[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.520]
No, yeah, that's true

[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:16.900]
Yeah

[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:19.100]
I thought I was a better B-S-R, but I'm not

[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.800]
What, you got a lot of New Yorkers, were you work?

[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.460]
Yeah

[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.760]
I'm from Ups and I'm from Fairport

[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.480]
Oh, great

[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.900]
That's why I worked in the park

[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:26.880]
I was working earlier this morning

[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.920]
About Don and Bob, so you got excited

[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.060]
He was ready to reach for those porkers right away

[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.420]
I liked the way you cut up that, that was classic

[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.360]
Yeah, wasn't he great?

[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:34.840]
Yeah

[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.620]
Yeah, Sendo's Canadians right back, all of them, not just the French Canadians

[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.460]
Every damn one of them back where they came from

[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.180]
They're nasty

[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:43.300]
First we have one of our account executives, Brian will get all up sick

[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.080]
Because he's a good guy

[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.080]
But we're sending him back too, that's all right

[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.540]
We're about to practice through you from

[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.520]
From Brighton

[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.060]
Brighton?

[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:49.400]
Yeah

[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.660]
Yeah, you used to work around there

[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.220]
You're right near Don and Bob's

[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:54.040]
I went to elementary school right next door there

[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:54.360]
Yeah

[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.820]
Brighton Elementary, I know the bird gets excited about this

[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.940]
You bet, every time we reminisce about Upstate New York

[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.020]
He starts gagging and his beak starts getting all nervous and chirpy

[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.220]
And he gets hysterical

[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.580]
I used to work around university

[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.040]
You noticed, yeah

[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.400]
Do I know this one?

[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.860]
How he just continues on

[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.620]
Why not? Why shouldn't we're having a conversation?

[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:12.240]
A conversation

[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:13.240]
Yeah

[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.240]
What do you want to do? Talk about Lakeland and the Stake and Shake again?

[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:16.680]
That's right

[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.420]
That's pretty exciting

[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:18.200]
Well, every time

[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.860]
Yeah, but Don and Bob's up against your lousy Stake and Shake any day of the week, you mungray

[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:23.760]
We give it net tyros as better than that

[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.160]
Exactly, we'll take you to Vick and Irv's

[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.180]
I'm going to have a garbage plate for $350

[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.220]
Yeah, exactly

[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.980]
We'll take you, we'll make you smell the lilac for $250

[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.760]
That'll open up your nostrils

[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:34.840]
Right?

[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:35.620]
Right

[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.180]
We'll take him up to Cobb's Hill and we'll put him on a water fountain

[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:38.780]
That's tall

[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:42.500]
I was not just people from New York telling me I'm an apple knocker

[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:43.660]
All right, tell us, it is

[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.440]
Tell us loud mouth out, not just douchebags from New York

[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.700]
To chill out, okay, Tommy

[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.760]
That's not what I was talking about

[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.020]
And his name is Vinnie

[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:53.180]
And he's always told me, yeah, I never heard him ratchet stuff

[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:58.860]
Yeah, of course not, because he doesn't have a brain large enough to get a word that big in his brain, okay?

[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:01.480]
Hey, your mother takes a bath in the Genesci River

[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.780]
Yeah, very funny

[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.160]
Tell them to take a word of it

[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.400]
Don't say that again, but that's okay

[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.320]
You're not Vinnie, who the hell are you?

[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:09.980]
I'm Bill

[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:11.200]
You're Phil, okay

[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.940]
What do you got me else confused on, Rattled?

[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:15.920]
You've taken a page from the Captain Dave Songbook there

[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.500]
Oh yeah

[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.800]
There seems to be a lot of that stuff going around these days

[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.420]
Wow

[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.020]
Yeah

[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.400]
Even see it on bumper stickers now

[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:22.940]
Yeah

[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:27.140]
In fact Beverly Phillips has got a new bumper stick says, bleep happens, I can't believe it

[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:31.460]
Paulus, and have a great day Phil, and we'll see you dot in Bob's and Vick and Irv's

[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.140]
I'll put Cadet cleaners in the 12 corners

[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:40.100]
I don't blame you, I was the last summer man, we got up to at least 30 degrees in July, it was great

[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.440]
I'll see you finger lakes

[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.400]
All right, take it

[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.100]
Bye Phil

[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:48.580]
Now what's wrong with that? What is wrong with I'll see it finger lakes? You don't even know what that is

[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:52.580]
You guys named about 15 places that nobody's familiar with

[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.760]
Except maybe your basic Rochester fairy

[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.920]
Okay, here we go

[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:01.400]
I mean what if I wasn't to talk about months and or a pace

[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.340]
Okay, I apologize to those people some of them been waiting a long time

[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:06.380]
I just hung up on all the lie, okay, now wait a minute

[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.020]
I just hung up on everybody, okay, cleared the board, you know why?

[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.380]
Because I want only people now in the next half hour or so

[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.860]
The calling who heard of a lot of those places that I just mentioned, okay?

[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.300]
See I'll give you got you and they call it tit for tat

[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:21.500]
All you upstate New York people call in and let Captain Dave have a dose of his own medicine

[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.640]
I mean here's a big city slicker from Milton Florida, okay?

[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:29.000]
He's from a town that makes two egg look like Manhattan, okay?

[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:33.880]
And he's ragging on us because we have a lot of people from upstate New York out there

[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.620]
Look at the phone man, they're going nuts

[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.120]
I'll punch him up, don't worry about it

[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.240]
Dave County, hello

[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.440]
Ray's race track

[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.340]
Finger Lakes

[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:44.020]
Yeah, yeah, absolutely

[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.100]
You lose some money there?

[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.120]
I lost some money there, made some money there when I was going to school

[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:51.920]
Then upstate New York and right time for it to keep going

[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.000]
Okay, thank you

[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:53.680]
Buh-bye

[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.260]
There's water

[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:55.880]
Yeah, there's one

[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.060]
You among brain, you douchebag

[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.860]
Or he is so full of what he said yesterday

[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.540]
It's 8.30 on Zeta 4, Dave County, hello

[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:05.800]
Watertown, New York

[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.520]
Alright, let's hear it for watertown man, where they have 40 foot drips of snow

[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.880]
Okay, that's right

[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.720]
And Masina

[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.180]
Uh-huh, Carthage

[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:14.180]
Now you're talking

[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.160]
Alright Neil

[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.220]
Take care, bye-bye

[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:19.460]
Take that

[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:24.120]
Well, you know they do have a lot of good stores

[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:24.980]
And take this

[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:26.660]
Yeah

[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.540]
I bet you even browned those from Rochester, right?

[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:35.780]
Oh, cheek to wagging New York

[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.360]
Yeah, you have to listen to my KVW and Buffalo

[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:44.100]
Okay, then never withstand Roberts and Rod Roddy and all those douchebags, exactly

[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.620]
Exactly, it was great up there

[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:46.620]
Dick Beyondy

[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:47.240]
Yeah

[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:50.600]
And the, uh, the Hound Dog, George Lorenz

[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.940]
Yeah, you used to go and see the Rochester Red Wing's play

[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.380]
In Silver Stadium

[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.500]
That's right, that's right, that's right

[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.540]
You used to go and see the Buffalo Bison's play

[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.880]
There's nothing, I'm telling you, there's nothing like sitting in Red Wing or Silver Stadium

[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.540]
It's called now

[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:05.060]
And having a couple of white hots with onions on them, man

[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:08.580]
I just sit there and smell the aroma of the lilacs from Cobb's Hill

[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:15.380]
That's what life's all about, these people from Florida wouldn't know life if it bit them on the butt, you know what?

[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:16.840]
I'm curious to hear it all right

[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.400]
Okay, see you later

[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.480]
A bunch of Hick Redneck douchebags

[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:26.540]
Oh, I'm from Florida, yeah, I'd be ashamed to tell anybody about it, okay? I would hate to admit it

[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.820]
What on the Andethal State?

[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.320]
There's a big sign when you drive into Milton, Florida

[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.180]
You found the Andethal Hound

[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.140]
That's what it says

[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:47.260]
Okay, 8.32 on Zeta 4, where are we going next here? Let's take another Broward caller, hello

[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:48.640]
Yeah, I'm Carl from Boca

[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.460]
Speak to me

[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:53.660]
Um, I got the five plastic Jesus' to put on my dashboard

[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.920]
Okay, I'm a Zeta, I'm a carer, George

[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:56.900]
But where are you from?

[00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:57.480]
Boca

[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:58.360]
Boca

[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.540]
Howard County, hello

[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:02.480]
Hi

[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.880]
Yes, upstate in New York, calling?

[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:04.360]
Okay

[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.540]
Hi, Crystal Beach

[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:08.340]
Crystal Beach, where is that?

[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.400]
Well, I'm going to say the other side of Buffalo

[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:14.260]
Oh, the other side of Buffalo, like for Donia, Dunkirk?

[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:15.660]
No, in Canada

[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:16.820]
Oh, in Canada?

[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.920]
I know it, it looks like the day and day

[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.780]
Oh, in Ontario, what are you okay?

[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:25.080]
I can tell by the sound of your voice, you're one of those minorities, one of the nice Canadians

[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.880]
No, no, born in Buffalo

[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.380]
Oh, you're born in Buffalo, and other than you got lost, they shipped you across the Peace Bridge?

[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:31.600]
Kind of like that

[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:32.180]
Yeah, I see

[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:33.320]
Peace Bridge

[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:36.900]
The Peace Bridge, that's right, the Peace Bridge, okay?

[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.760]
I like that he's hot dog

[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.440]
What is it?

[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:41.500]
That he's hot dog

[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.720]
How about, let's see, what do they got in Buffalo that alley, Mike subs?

[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:45.940]
And chicken wings?

[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.840]
Yeah, they're big on chicken wings in Buffalo, aren't they?

[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.680]
Because they got all those Polish people up there and that's all they can eat, is chicken wings

[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.960]
What are we gonna do, we're gonna hang fort Lauderdale and have a mask, you know?

[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.080]
Evidently, yeah

[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:57.620]
Sounds good

[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:58.200]
Okay

[00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:58.900]
Love yourself

[00:44:58.900 --> 00:44:59.500]
Bye-bye

[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:05.840]
I see that we're getting, just a flood of upstate New Yorkers here and you people, gee

[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.500]
I think it's like some kind of a game or some kind of a joke

[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:15.280]
This is what real life is all about, speaking of that, here's Jay Michaels in his, the last day for his Tiffany

[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:16.100]
Wow

[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:20.320]
And my Tiffany should be arriving at about 10 o'clock this morning, I just mentioned that in the past

[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.140]
Should be

[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.100]
Yeah, hopefully

[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:27.960]
I mean, it's desperate, it's like now or never, now who the hell is that that just drove in there and that can't lie

[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.080]
Sales person

[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.240]
Right behind Jay Michaels

[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:30.800]
Brian, is that Brian?

[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:33.440]
Is that our Canadian American friend?

[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:34.200]
Our token Canadian

[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:39.420]
Yeah, that's our token minority Canadian, we had a higher one Canadian on the staff and we leave it to Brian, he's a good guy

[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.700]
He needs to get rid of that Canadian background

[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:43.540]
It's 834

[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.540]
Look at those lines flash and men are flashing like a Hanukkah bush

[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:54.540]
This is what life is all about, I'm trying to tell you, is a white hot it down and bobs a trip to a finger like to plunge your brains out

[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:59.740]
Then a little trip on the through way to Batavia downs at night for those one to five shots

[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.860]
Even Fred shots never saw such shots

[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.940]
As you'll see a Batavia downs, I actually won money there every night when I was on vacation

[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.480]
I know that's shocking

[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:10.880]
Shocking

[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:18.960]
I don't want to get Ricky all upset there about the track it is hopes up because it's you know one of those things if you take 10-20,000 with your Ricky you got to be ready to lose it

[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:25.100]
834 on Zeta 4 and now don't stop bringing a phone just let him keep bringing away we'll call it a screenless Tuesday

[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.600]
Oh that's amazing

[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:33.080]
Interesting that I dreamed up that idea just like in the phones flash and all of a sudden it became a screenless Thursday and a meatless Friday and a

[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.000]
Mungless Tuesday

[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.880]
We don't have a screen today so it's kind of a pro

[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:37.740]
Yeah sure is

[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:38.160]
Okay

[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:39.480]
Now don't you

[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:46.260]
If you're going out in the sun as Alan Braira would say be sure to use screen number three today because the sun is picking through those high clouds up in the sky
