[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580]
Right. What a guy. 914. It's Ernie Soach and Junior ladies and gentlemen.

[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.400]
Unbelievably, we're just setting like radio history here today.

[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.280]
Unbelievably. And now we're up to M with our bits. Are you ready for the M?

[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.920]
I'm ready. Okay, here it is.

[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.920]
So Vester Stallone stars in his most...

[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.820]
915 on the Neil Rogers show in Zeta 4 now. Oh yeah. Yeah, it's time for our mystery record.

[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.640]
Oh, isn't done this in a couple of hours because the phones have been so darn busy.

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.840]
But finally we have a little reprieve and this is the one you want to guess. Here we go.

[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.900]
What? What? What happened? You didn't push the right button. It's okay. Now here are the numbers.

[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.760]
If you want to guess on this, 620 3600, did...

[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.680]
Yeah, why don't you... why don't you guess without listening? That'd be 7779 3600,

[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.120]
empowered. If you think you know what this is. Wow. Now you're going to have to do it again,

[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.600]
but that was great. Okay, that's the mystery sound. Remember, you don't win anything.

[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.240]
Just have the fun of playing along with this here on the little game. Here it is.

[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.920]
Whoa, it gave a little too much for you John. Yeah, yeah, a little extra hint there for everybody. I think...

[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.440]
But look at that. Look, every line lights up. Can you believe it? Every line lights up.

[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.560]
Well, they're anxious to win nothing. Hi.

[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.020]
There's people out in the hall looking through the window at us, you know.

[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.880]
Yeah, they're anxious to win nothing, so we're more than happy to accommodate from this morning.

[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.180]
Let's take some guesses to see if anybody knows what it is. Hi, Broward.

[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.540]
Oh, you have to push the button. Oh, hello.

[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.400]
There's nobody there. Are you there? Hello? Broward?

[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.560]
I love you. Who is this?

[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.080]
Do I know you? I do. You're kidding. I swear.

[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.380]
This isn't Patty, is it? Oh, not Patty. You want a guess, John?

[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.200]
Oh, I couldn't put it on the radio. Yeah, all right. Bye.

[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.620]
Yeah.

[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.380]
Dave County.

[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.240]
That's strange, Broward. Dave County, hi.

[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.760]
What was that? What was what?

[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.800]
That last caller?

[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.580]
Yeah.

[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.560]
Well, they all come out of the woodwork when Neil's not here.

[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.220]
It's part of the fun, you know. Well, anyway, it couldn't be Kenny Lagan's.

[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.200]
No, it's not Kenny Lagan's.

[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.340]
I didn't think you would play Kenny Lagan's, that's why.

[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.880]
Well, you never know with Johnny.

[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.860]
Yeah, I'm sure.

[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.260]
And there's no pattern, you know.

[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.800]
Okay, I'll try again.

[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.120]
Bye.

[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.240]
Oh, rhyme, no reason.

[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.760]
That's it.

[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.440]
Dave County.

[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.380]
Hello.

[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.000]
Hello.

[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.440]
Hi.

[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.960]
Yeah, I got a guess for the song.

[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.420]
Okay.

[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.600]
How about Bad Company?

[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.320]
No.

[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.340]
Not bad company.

[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.920]
Oh, okay.

[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.940]
Not even good company.

[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.160]
Thanks.

[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.760]
All right.

[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.080]
Bye.

[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.380]
Broward.

[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.100]
Hey, bro.

[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.620]
Hey.

[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.900]
This is Bob Rand.

[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.000]
I want to hear Bob Rand.

[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.680]
You want to hear Bob, Bob Rand?

[00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.480]
Yes, sir.

[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.560]
We'll see what we can do.

[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.520]
You guys complain if you want to.

[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.040]
Uh-huh.

[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.880]
All right.

[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.300]
You guys are trying to get through.

[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.900]
Uh-huh.

[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.660]
Yeah, we'd go good.

[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.300]
Yeah, all right.

[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.980]
We'll see what we can do.

[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.960]
You want to guess on the song?

[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.500]
Huh?

[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.640]
You want to guess on the song?

[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.320]
The song that you just played?

[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.720]
Yeah, the little mystery song?

[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.860]
Um, no.

[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.720]
I haven't got that.

[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.900]
That's okay.

[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.880]
There's no clue.

[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.380]
All right.

[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.620]
Hey, I'm going to rip you guys.

[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.160]
You're going to play it.

[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.920]
I will see if you can.

[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.200]
All right.

[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.600]
You're okay.

[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.300]
Okay.

[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.800]
All right.

[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.900]

[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.040]
Dave County.

[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.320]
Hello.

[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.840]
This is Broward County.

[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.620]
Well, I'm sorry.

[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.840]
How you doing today?

[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.700]
Yeah, how you doing?

[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.140]
Okay.

[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.280]
Is it spinning wheel?

[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.600]
Is it spinning wheel?

[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.220]
No.

[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.080]
No.

[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.620]

[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.020]
I'm about to turn gears.

[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.800]
Is it, John?

[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.300]
No.

[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.380]
Not by BSNT.

[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.020]
All right.

[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.400]
What are they?

[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.780]
Sure.

[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.020]
It's a pure dark over there.

[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.780]
I'm sorry.

[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.340]
They're starting to learn about you.

[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.060]
See, 6203600 in date and at 77793600 in Broward.

[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.120]
And I'm sure you've got it.

[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.900]
Should I give them one more taste of it?

[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.120]
Yeah.

[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.540]
Will you hand me that news at USA Today

[00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.700]
underneath the cart over there, the cap and Dave put there?

[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.720]
And so I'm going to do the 920 updates

[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.900]
so you don't have to mess with that.

[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.220]
No.

[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.980]
Oh, unless you want to.

[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.920]
Unless you specifically want to.

[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.520]
We're going to be your classic.

[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:08.660]
Yeah, it could be.

[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.560]
You're absolutely right.

[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.000]
Broward County.

[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.320]
Hi.

[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.460]
Hi.

[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.960]
Hi.

[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.380]
Hi.

[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.000]
Glenn.

[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.480]
Yeah.

[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.080]
Hi.

[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.560]
This is Lynn.

[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.320]
Hi, Lynn.

[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.320]
First time caller.

[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:16.880]
Uh-huh.

[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.220]
Loyal Zadol listener.

[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.280]
Good to hear from you.

[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.960]
How come you never call the needles here?

[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.780]
I try to, but I most times I can't get through.

[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.420]
Uh-huh.

[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.980]
I just wanted to see.

[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.620]
Do me a favor.

[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.180]
What's that?

[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.260]
I like you to call my boyfriend a douchebag.

[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.320]
Yesterday was his birthday.

[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.880]
She can't.

[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.340]
Glenn can't call somebody a douchebag.

[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.360]
Now I can't do that.

[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.100]
You know, that's Neal's thing.

[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.620]
And Dave isn't here to tell him to go to hell.

[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.080]
So.

[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.300]
He can tell him to go to hell.

[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.660]
Do that.

[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.980]
Well, why don't you do it?

[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.240]
You know, he, you know, why don't you do it?

[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.260]
No?

[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.940]
Yesterday was his birthday?

[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.540]
Yeah.

[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.120]
Wow.

[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.260]
Well, happy birthday.

[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.300]
Thank you.

[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.600]
OK.

[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.340]
OK.

[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.000]
Bye-bye.

[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.460]
Bye-bye.

[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.600]
Broward?

[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.760]
I guess it's not.

[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.140]
Yeah.

[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.680]
Go ahead.

[00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.420]
Oh, hi.

[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.100]
Hey, you're on the air.

[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.700]
Oh, OK.

[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.920]
Is it Cecilia?

[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.760]
No.

[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.800]
It's not Cecilia.

[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.560]
Oh, well.

[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.540]
OK, thanks.

[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.900]
Uh-huh.

[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.740]
Dave?

[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.140]
I smoke a sass press.

[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.820]
Hot smoking sass press by the bubble puppy.

[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.060]
Good guess, don't you think?

[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.880]
That's a good guess, no one.

[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.340]
Nobody's going to get that with that short of a thing.

[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.260]
There's no way in the world.

[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.440]
Well, that's sort of a thing.

[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.560]
Well, we can make it a little bit longer thing.

[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.380]
Nobody's going to get that.

[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.880]
I'm telling you.

[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.620]
Well, I haven't given us an extra little hint.

[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.360]
OK.

[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.120]
Bye-bye.

[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.960]
You can do that before they guess some more.

[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.020]
Let's listen to it one more time.

[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.020]
Now, you should be able to get it from that.

[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.540]
I think, I think that's fair.

[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.960]
Brenda Richie, wife of singer Lionel Richie,

[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.820]
was warned by a district attorney's administrator yesterday

[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.540]
to stay away from her husband's lady friend.

[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.000]
Oh, hi.

[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.820]
Diane Alexander.

[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.640]
She beat up on it.

[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.080]
That's right.

[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.660]
Remember that?

[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.520]
They had the big battle, Brenda Richie and Diana Alexander.

[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.720]
I don't know what the problem was.

[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.060]
He was only messing around with this other woman.

[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.640]
It doesn't.

[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.540]
Following a morning hearing with Alexander

[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.320]
and an afternoon session with Brenda Richie,

[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.020]
Officer Kay Kerr-Trail said she could not

[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.120]
assess blame for that June 29th battle

[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.260]
between the two women that also involved Lionel.

[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.980]
She said she could not recommend pressing charges.

[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.080]
Brenda Richie has been charged with

[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.560]
vandalism, resisting arrest,

[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.660]
disturbing the peace,

[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.820]
and corporal abuse of a spouse

[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.680]
because she had no cooperation

[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.520]
from the one witness Lionel Richie.

[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.100]
Richie did not attend that session with his wife

[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.960]
as was expected,

[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.520]
and the officer says he does not want to press charges

[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.980]
against his wife.

[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.380]
This is like, this is better than days of our lives.

[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.620]
And it's real.

[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.040]
And it's, it is real.

[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.980]
So no charges on Brenda Richie.

[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.560]
And I'm sure there'll be more to this story

[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.860]
and we'll keep you up to date on it.

[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.640]
922, we'll be right back with more of your guesses.

[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.840]
Since 925 on Zeta 4,

[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.580]
Captain Davis has gone to Gerber's to get us some food to eat.

[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.900]
So we're going to eat in the last half hour

[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.840]
before the end of the show because you people have gone through

[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.560]
with the trolls.

[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.080]
It's needles being gone.

[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.920]
We haven't really been eating on the air.

[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.380]
J. America's brought us some bagels,

[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.580]
but I mean, we're going to really,

[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.160]
we're going to get into chicken subs and stuff, John.

[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.940]
It's going to be great.

[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.700]
All right, let's take it.

[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.720]
We've got a full board of calls.

[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.820]
So let's take some.

[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.500]
Wait a minute.

[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.720]
What?

[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.140]
Just so they don't know.

[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.640]
Oh, okay.

[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.500]
Now you should be able to get that.

[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.740]
I'm real serious.

[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.380]
With that hint,

[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.880]
you should be able to get that.

[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.800]
So let's see if anybody,

[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.480]
let me push this button myself.

[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.260]
And we'll go to date county.

[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.640]
Hello.

[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.280]
Hello.

[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.680]
Hi.

[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.080]
Yeah, is it ELO?

[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.020]
No, no.

[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.760]
How about foreigner?

[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.140]
No, it's going to go down the alphabet.

[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.160]
No, no.

[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:33.960]
All right.

[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.780]
Yeah, we're doing the alphabet on the bit.

[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:36.220]
Hello.

[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.080]
Yeah, we're going to get you the magical tune here.

[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.460]
I want to go out and live on this,

[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.320]
when you're a bit of a miracle,

[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.000]
the beautiful.

[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.600]
Excellent, Kess.

[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.520]
I think you're going to make it.

[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:50.820]
Bye-bye.

[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.520]
Great, Kess.

[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.540]
Date county.

[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.400]
We like those kind of guests.

[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:53.780]
That's right.

[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.120]
Hello.

[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:54.820]
Hello.

[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.220]
Hi.

[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.320]
Hello.

[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:56.900]
Is it this town?

[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.920]
No, not the stones.

[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.740]
Oh, this is a real tough one.

[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:01.320]
Is it?

[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:01.620]
Yeah.

[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.100]
All right.

[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:02.760]
Sorry.

[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.680]
Bye-bye.

[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:03.840]
Bye-bye.

[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:04.920]
Broward.

[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:05.400]
Yeah.

[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:06.480]
Hello.

[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:06.940]
Hi.

[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:07.480]
How you doing?

[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:07.920]
Good.

[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:08.860]
What's up?

[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.640]
Keeping busy?

[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.380]
Oh, yeah.

[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.160]
Now you want to guess on this song?

[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.880]
I know, but I got some notes to say.

[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.320]
Okay.

[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.580]
You know, I heard that Lana Richie's wife

[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.960]
is taking lessons from Sean Penn.

[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.560]
You know, I hadn't thought about it that way.

[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.600]
Yeah, which one is more violent?

[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.260]
Uh, they haven't decided yet.

[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:25.840]
I think it's a tie.

[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:26.280]
Yeah.

[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.700]
Did you hear that story yesterday that Madonna's brother

[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.140]
is more violent than Sean Penn?

[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:30.660]
Yeah, I heard that.

[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.320]
That's incredible.

[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.840]
I'll look to food is here.

[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:33.640]
Food is here, sir.

[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.240]
We got to go.

[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:34.800]
Okay.

[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.140]
Bye.

[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:36.260]
Broward.

[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.320]
No, that's not it.

[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.180]
Good guess.

[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:42.260]
Broward.

[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:42.780]
Yes.

[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:43.420]
Hi.

[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.460]
This is, uh,

[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.260]
this is someone guess the song yet?

[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:46.820]
Not yet.

[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:47.480]
All right.

[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.020]
I got to guess.

[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:48.460]
Okay.

[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.620]
I'm off to guess who I can't explain.

[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:51.440]
No.

[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:52.880]
Uh, sorry.

[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:53.900]
Sorry.

[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:54.560]
Thank you, man.

[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:54.960]
Nobody.

[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.400]
Dave, you're on the air.

[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:57.380]
Hello.

[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:57.880]
Yeah.

[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.320]
Hi.

[00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:58.920]
How you doing?

[00:08:59.180 --> 00:08:59.300]
Okay.

[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.900]
I want to guess that song.

[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.320]
Okay.

[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.400]
Is it the James Bond theme song?

[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:03.980]
Nope.

[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:04.460]
No.

[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.120]
That's not yet.

[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:05.640]
All right.

[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.120]
All right.

[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:06.960]
Thank you.

[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:07.580]
Dave.

[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:08.640]
Hi.

[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.400]
I'd like to guess on this song.

[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:10.840]
Okay.

[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.380]
Um, positive, fourth treat?

[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:14.080]
No.

[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.620]
Good guess, but no.

[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.960]
Yeah, it kind of starts the same way.

[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:17.880]
Yeah.

[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.440]
Thanks for trying.

[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.000]
It's a good cheer about Dave County.

[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.520]
I got a guess on the song.

[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:23.940]
All right.

[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.880]
How about Sammy Davis Jr.?

[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.980]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.040]
Mr. Candyman?

[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:28.600]
Yeah.

[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.500]
That's a cool.

[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.200]
Oh, wow.

[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:30.840]
Potato chips.

[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:31.380]
Look at this.

[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:31.880]
That's a cool.

[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.460]
Oh, my god.

[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.800]
Yeah, maybe we even got us potato chips.

[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.100]
Look at the size of those suckers.

[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.140]
Yeah, these are huge.

[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.100]
I can't believe it.

[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:37.580]
See you later.

[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.080]
All right.

[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.760]
You put a lot of salt on mine, right?

[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:40.920]
Yeah, right.

[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.720]
Broward, hi.

[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.340]
Yeah, is that all of the beach boys?

[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.340]
Beach boys?

[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:45.620]
No.

[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:45.940]
No.

[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.500]
Oh, sorry.

[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:49.060]
Broward.

[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.780]
Hey, how about magical mystery tour?

[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:51.100]
No.

[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:51.520]

[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.220]
All right.

[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:52.980]
This is Bob again.

[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.600]
I'm trying hard.

[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.740]
Keep trying, Bob.

[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:55.960]
No, we're going to stop this one.

[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.000]
I got to go to doctors for medication.

[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.940]
That's my problem.

[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.980]
But, uh, you know, let's tell our bitches

[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.080]
the very to hatch it.

[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.400]
Oh.

[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.220]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:06.380]
OK.

[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.300]
Is that fair?

[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.100]
I guess.

[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:08.880]
Whatever you say.

[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.020]
Yeah, whatever you say today.

[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.580]
Um, let's.

[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:12.040]
Yeah.

[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:12.880]
Broward, hi.

[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:13.500]
That's sick.

[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:14.900]
Sticks?

[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:15.440]
No.

[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.920]
It's not sticks, is it, John?

[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:17.380]
What's this?

[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:17.860]
No.

[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.820]
Oh, thanks.

[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.260]
Great.

[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.400]
Absolutely amazing.

[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:23.940]
Yeah.

[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:24.940]
You know what?

[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.260]
I'll give that little thing time too.

[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.700]
I'll just just walk you this into it one more time.

[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.060]
OK.

[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:29.640]
Yeah.

[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.000]
Because I just, um,

[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.800]
oh boy, he got a lot.

[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:34.840]
Go through that time.

[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.380]
Way too much now.

[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.560]
I think if you really, you know,

[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.840]
really rack your brain,

[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.140]
you'll get that one.

[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.160]
Date County, hi.

[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:43.780]
Howdy.

[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.960]
How about feel that make love?

[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.000]
No.

[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:46.980]
Nope.

[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:47.460]
Side it.

[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.860]
Date County.

[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:50.820]
Hello.

[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.420]
Yeah, I was going to guess the same thing we discussed.

[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:54.420]
Man, sorry.

[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.200]
You what?

[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.820]
Oh, someone already guessed it?

[00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:57.900]
OK.

[00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:58.720]
Date County.

[00:10:59.340 --> 00:10:59.820]
Hi.

[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:00.920]
Oops.

[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.240]
Let's go to Broward.

[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:02.820]
You're on the air.

[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:03.340]
Yeah.

[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.240]
Is it the beetle?

[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:05.480]
Is it the beetle?

[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.560]
It is not the beetles.

[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.340]
Yeah, I'm not sure.

[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:07.940]
How about the the rottedger?

[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:08.860]
No.

[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:11.120]

[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:11.700]
OK.

[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:13.800]
Broward.

[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:14.420]
Hi.

[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.880]
Yeah, how about Michael Jackson?

[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.000]
No, Michael, it's not Michael Jackson.

[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:18.880]
Now, would I do the beetles?

[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.900]
You play a lot of Michael Jackson.

[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:20.720]
Would I do the beetles?

[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.700]
OK, I'll try again later.

[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.460]
OK, would I do the beetles or Michael Jackson

[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.680]
or anybody that's known?

[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.300]
It would have to be somebody who's, you know,

[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.440]
totally unknown.

[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.900]
Right, you got to consider the source.

[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.680]
You must consider the source.

[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.160]
Broward, hi, you're on the air.

[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.700]
I think the group is by the name of Can't Heat

[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.380]
and I think the title of it is going up the country.

[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.340]
What did he say?

[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.320]
Let's work together.

[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.420]
Boy, you're real close.

[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.400]
Oh boy.

[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.500]
You're real close.

[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.120]
Yeah.

[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.780]
But you got a half a star for that.

[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:45.280]
Yeah.

[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.520]
So you tell him if he's got the title or the artist correct,

[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.300]
will you go that far?

[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.540]
I think I got the artist Can't Heat, but I, you know,

[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.820]
they only had two or three hits and good Lord knows

[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.580]
which one it was.

[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.160]
No, you have the wrong artist.

[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.200]
Wrong artist.

[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.600]
But let's work together is the right title.

[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.560]
You got a half a star.

[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.080]
All right, so we're going to go and try to see

[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.160]
if we can get the artist, OK?

[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:04.720]
Thank you, sir.

[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.540]
Thanks very much.

[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.040]
All right, it's let's work together.

[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:07.760]
I know.

[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.100]
I know.

[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.180]
Is the Gonson.

[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:10.700]
Gonson.

[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.120]
I know.

[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.640]
Hi, Dave County.

[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.920]
Yeah, Jackson Brown running on empty.

[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.420]
No, no, not paying attention.

[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.200]
Whoops.

[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.360]
Dave, hi.

[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.280]
Yeah, how about Bob Dylan, rainy day women,

[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.380]
number 12 and 35?

[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.900]
Yeah, it would be a great record for the day,

[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.920]
but it's not yet.

[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:27.680]
It's not yet.

[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.120]
All right.

[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.880]
All right, we found out the title.

[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.260]
Let me look up words together.

[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.040]
Let me see if I can, let me see if I, boy, this is, you know,

[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.180]
hard on me.

[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.120]
But let me see if I can see it in the book here.

[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.840]
This is it.

[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.000]
Nobody's going to get the artist.

[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.620]
The artist is a one hit one here.

[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.500]
You're still doing this song?

[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:44.840]
I know.

[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.380]
Can you believe it?

[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.620]
We started it at the time.

[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.920]
She was making the song.

[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.920]
No, I don't know who the artist is either.

[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.700]
We'll go through one more rack here of callers and then

[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.300]
forget it.

[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:54.940]
Broward.

[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.220]
Hi, you're on the air.

[00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.880]
OK, is it Chicago?

[00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:58.920]
No, no.

[00:12:59.540 --> 00:12:59.940]
Sorry.

[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.400]
Broward, you're on the air.

[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.860]
Yeah, it's the chipmunks.

[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:04.780]
Chipmunks.

[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.060]
Excellent, yes, sir.

[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.420]
Let's work together by the chipmunks.

[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.000]
We'll get the guns in here to tell us who it is.

[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.360]
Broward?

[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.160]
Hi.

[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:13.320]
Hello.

[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:14.700]
My name's Aaron.

[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:15.640]
Yeah, you are on the air.

[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.060]
OK.

[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.780]
My wife's been telling me about it.

[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.600]
She played a few days ago with Mr. Ed.

[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.220]
She said it was an absolute riot.

[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.440]
Oh, my boss is a jerk.

[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.260]
A jerk, a jerk.

[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:24.620]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.140]
Can you play that?

[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.620]
Not today, but I'll pass Dan already.

[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.060]
Yeah, we'll read it in.

[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:29.960]
You just missed it.

[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:30.620]
Oh, no.

[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.600]
Now I tell you what, pal.

[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.600]
I won't do it today, but I'll be glad to do it later this week.

[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.660]
I'll play it for you like tomorrow.

[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:37.680]
Give me a call.

[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.680]
Let me know when you're going to play it.

[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.360]
Or you can give me a call and remind me,

[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.640]
and I'll play it for you then, OK?

[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.800]
You'll personally call you at home, sir.

[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.040]
Why don't you give me a call back and remind me

[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:45.860]
and I'll play it for you tomorrow.

[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:46.960]
OK, good.

[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.160]
All right.

[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:47.380]
All right.

[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.780]
Dade County.

[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.200]
I know Don Kuger.

[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.120]
No.

[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:52.680]
No.

[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:53.440]
You're kidding.

[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.100]
No.

[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.520]
I'm like little ditty.

[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:57.700]
Oh, well.

[00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:58.680]
Again.

[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.120]
Good guest considering yesterday.

[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.340]
Bye-bye.

[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:01.940]
OK, bye.

[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.200]
Dade.

[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:03.860]
I've got it.

[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.260]
OK.

[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:05.900]
It's piggy-wee love.

[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.260]
It's a good show.

[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.540]
Dade County.

[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:10.820]
Hello.

[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:11.720]
Yeah.

[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:12.820]
OK.

[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.380]
Listen here.

[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.880]
I haven't listened to you guys for quite a while now.

[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.300]
And you can't really picture.

[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.420]
Are you guys looking?

[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.080]
That's right.

[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:23.780]
You're lucky.

[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:24.780]
Why is that?

[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.660]
Well, trust us.

[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:27.280]
OK.

[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:28.860]
So what's your point?

[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.980]
Could you just like just about tell me what Neil looks like?

[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.840]
I picture him like a little ball-ball man.

[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.260]
No, he's not bald.

[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:38.680]
No.

[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:39.420]
Mm-hmm.

[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:39.920]
Really?

[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.820]
He's a little roton.

[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.040]
Roton.

[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.480]
Just a touch.

[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:46.980]
Yeah.

[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:47.480]
Just a hair.

[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.580]
But he's not bald.

[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.340]
And he's not a little old man.

[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.800]
No, he doesn't look old at all.

[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.260]
I've never seen you guys.

[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.520]
Now, the best thing for this guy to do

[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.740]
is he's right in for a photo, right?

[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.100]
Well, I tell you what, if you'll write me a postcard

[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.580]
or a letter and ask me to send you a picture, I'll do it.

[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.460]
And then he'll know.

[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.100]
Then he'll know.

[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.140]
Yes, I will.

[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.280]
All right, you bet.

[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:06.780]
I'll do it.

[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.040]
OK.

[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.860]
Have they guessed the phone yet?

[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:09.240]
No.

[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.540]
But the J-Galb man.

[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.780]
It's not J-Galb.

[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:12.120]
Sorry.

[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.100]
See you later.

[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.900]
All right, we're going to have to tell him, I guess,

[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:15.580]
or Gonser.

[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.180]
Yeah, Gonser.

[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:16.700]
Can I call me Tom?

[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.020]
Yeah.

[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:17.560]
Can't heat.

[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.480]
No, it's not.

[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:18.820]
I know.

[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.300]
Wilbur Harrison.

[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:21.120]
That's him.

[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.060]
Oh, well.

[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.560]
Hey, we've got another winner.

[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.220]
Yes, and our winner this hour is Jeff Gonser.

[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:29.480]
Yeah.

[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.160]
If I win an Eagle Brand potato chip.

[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:31.680]
Yeah.

[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:32.340]
Exactly.

[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.580]
How do you have a story about Wilbur Harrison?

[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.860]
Yeah, want to talk about that?

[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.000]
Well, that was a medley of his hit.

[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:38.380]
That's right.

[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.280]
No, Kansas City was a big hit.

[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.180]
You're right.

[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:41.640]
Yeah.

[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.700]
In 1959.

[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:43.880]
Let's work together.

[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.120]
Part one is 69.

[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.060]
And how high in the country?

[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:48.620]
32.

[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.200]
That's a smash.

[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.500]
Went up to 32.

[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.580]
And he did play it.

[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.180]
And it did get a extensive AOR play in the early 70s.

[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:57.400]
That's right.

[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.300]
That's right.

[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.960]
It's one of those you just don't hear anymore.

[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.980]
And when you hear it, you'll know why.

[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.220]
Now, this is great.

[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.000]
It's on on Zeta 4.

[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.120]
Together we will stand.

[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.280]
I didn't hear a phone.

[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.520]
Come on, not be bold.

[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.000]
Let's get on the phone and work together.

[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.400]
Come on, come on, let's work together.

[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.840]
Now, not be bold.

[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.880]
Say now together we will stand.

[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:56.240]
And how we've been AOR playin'

[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.680]
We spoke a lot And we came together We spoke a lot

[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:57.700]
And we came to get a much brighter than it could be.

[00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:57.720]
And I didn't hear a phone.

[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:57.860]
Run to arrangements against all of you

[00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:58.800]
I'm playing it.

[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.060]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.880]
Oh, look at that.

[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:13.200]
You don't think it's enough?

[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.140]
We don't have any idea.

[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:18.620]
Yeah.

[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.180]
So get to me.

[00:17:48.140 --> 00:18:13.520]
Oh, yeah.

[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:20.500]
Oh, yeah.

[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.500]
Wilbert Harrison, let's work together.

[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.760]
1969 hit and nobody got it.

[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:39.820]
Do you stump them again, John?

[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.700]
You seem to stump them one time each day.

[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.660]
They got the title.

[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.180]
They got the title.

[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.720]
That's very good, too.

[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.400]
But who could, you know, who could forget Wilbert Harrison?

[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.440]
He did Kansas City.

[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:48.740]
Yeah, everybody remembers.

[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.480]
I mean, that's a great song.

[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.940]
I remember can he doing it, but you got it.

[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.220]
It's probably about half a second of it.

[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.200]
Then I was going to win it.

[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.580]
Do you have a problem with that?

[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.380]
I think Joseph Gubbles did that in 1930s.

[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:02.500]
Not Germany.

[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.340]
That was only 1969.

[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.840]
It wasn't that sub-head.

[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.200]
937 now in the Neal Roger Show in Zeta.

[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:08.940]
We're going to do this.

[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.560]
And then, Johnny, what are we going to do?

[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.120]
We're going to do stuff here.

[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.440]
Yeah, 935 stuff at 937.

[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.280]
Okay, and then we're going to do in.

[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.580]
Ten years from now, Hong Kong will be returned to the Chinese.

[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.120]
The US leaks on the Panama Canal will have just expired.

[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.820]
But owners of the new 100-200 series Audi's

[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.180]
will still be enjoying the Audi advantage.

[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.360]
That's because the Audi advantage offers a full decade

[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.640]
of corrosion protection.

[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.160]
Ten full years.

[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.320]
The Audi advantage also offers three years or 50,000 miles

[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.220]
where Audi assumes all scheduled maintenance costs,

[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.700]
a guaranteed resale index that certifies trade-in value,

[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.220]
and even more restrictions apply.

[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.540]
But your dealer can provide details for the program

[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.560]
and the corrosion-perforation limited warranty.

[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.040]
So, think about it.

[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.220]
Ten years from now, you could be congratulating yourself

[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.500]
on having bought an Audi.

[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.540]
Or asking yourself why you took the risk of buying anything else.

[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.400]
Find out more about the Audi advantage.

[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.060]
On Tuesday, now let's do this, and then I'll do this, John.

[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.880]
Let's play in, and then I'll be back, and I'll tell you what,

[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.700]
what's special about Tuesday.

[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.460]
Yeah, I think it is, too.

[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.620]
Alan Box was a normal man with a wife, children,

[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.960]
a summer home in Opalaka, and a chain of radio stations.

[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.040]
Well, normal that is until just three weeks ago.

[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.320]
Hi, honey, how was your day?

[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:42.720]
Un...

[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.360]
Believable.

[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:44.800]
Terminal!

[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.960]
There's nothing but subhuman douchebags out there.

[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.540]
Alan Box is suffering from Neal Rogers disease.

[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.820]
Have you canceled the Miami Herald yet?

[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.060]
But honey, we don't subscribe to the Herald.

[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.720]
Oh, now that's a cop-out.

[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.360]
What kind of a lame excuse is that?

[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.420]
Just say no to Elle Herald, sir.

[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:01.760]
Huh?

[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.160]
People afflicted with Neal Rogers disease

[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.680]
have lost the ability to communicate like normal human beings.

[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.260]
What's the matter with you?

[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.560]
Blue-haired old bags from Fembroke Pines.

[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.260]
You know, the Yen-Fen, so say, all Neal!

[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.480]
How can you say those nasty things?

[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.460]
Running around stealing sweet and low.

[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.620]
Can I get you anything?

[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.760]
How about those bag boys at Windixi?

[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:22.980]
You know, it doesn't hurt to look.

[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:24.340]
In...

[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:24.700]
credible.

[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.160]
Neal Rogers disease, a growing South Florida epidemic.

[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.900]
Please help us find a cure.

[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.660]
Honey, it's Friday night.

[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.100]
You know what that means.

[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.500]
Hey, you know what I got a nine?

[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.200]
A nine!

[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.700]
What's Lephalor got?

[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.440]
Three points, something?

[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.280]
Send your tax deductible contributions today in Carrop Hot 105.

[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:42.720]
Terminal.

[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:44.440]
Unbelievable.

[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.840]
I haven't heard that one in a while, have you?

[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.120]
We are eating chicken subs from Gerber's.

[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.060]
Oh boy, they're good.

[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.520]
We wanted to thank who, Ann.

[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.060]
And they're delicious.

[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:54.540]
I am.

[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.660]
They're the most amazing subs I've ever had in my life.

[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.100]
Johnny Dark has never had one before and he just...

[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.720]
Yeah, I hear you guys talking about Gerber's all the time and I couldn't believe it.

[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.440]
Flip down.

[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.740]
No, this man just flipped down.

[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.120]
I bit into that pepper and I knew the meaning of life.

[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.340]
So good.

[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.780]
Hi, Miami.

[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:12.200]
Hello.

[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.060]
Is this Neal Rogers disease?

[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:14.760]
Yes it is.

[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:15.620]
You're on the air.

[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:16.600]
How are you doing?

[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.620]
How are you doing?

[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.280]
I'm the first time college.

[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:19.960]
Are you really?

[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.440]
How come you never call with Neal's here?

[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.880]
I was always working.

[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.580]
You're not working today and stuff?

[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:27.840]
I'm off today.

[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.640]
Oh, great.

[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.540]
You guys are funny, man.

[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:31.360]
We're all thanks.

[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.680]
Oh, good.

[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:34.960]
Well, I'm glad you called.

[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.640]
This is kind of a funny show, isn't it?

[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.400]
Yeah, it is all amusing sometimes, isn't it?

[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.120]
Yeah, I was getting some stuff on the show.

[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.820]
Yeah, every now and again, we sure do.

[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.720]
We're eating chicken subs today.

[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.240]
Stubbs for breakfast?

[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:46.840]
Mm-hmm.

[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.820]
So make you feel at home.

[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.380]
They're outrageous.

[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.500]
I want to eat chicken subs already.

[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.860]
Well, I tell you, if you get up at the time we get up,

[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.640]
by this time you're ready for lunch, trust me.

[00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.880]
What time you get up?

[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.120]
Before five.

[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.060]
Before five clock?

[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.620]
Yeah, 4.30 or 5.

[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:09.700]
Oh, really?

[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.820]
Whoa, we're just gone crazy here.

[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:13.380]
Wait a minute.

[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.180]
All right, anything else?

[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.300]
Are you guys playing any Led Zeppelin?

[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:19.280]
No, right.

[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.080]
Not today.

[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:20.660]
Why not?

[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.340]
Well, we're just not in the mood today.

[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.700]
It's probably a long version of Starway to Heaven.

[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.840]
I heard Starway to Heaven yesterday on Zeta.

[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.300]
Did you miss it?

[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.140]
I heard it yesterday about five o'clock.

[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:30.740]
I will.

[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.600]
Yeah, did you miss it?

[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:33.180]
Yeah.

[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.440]
I heard it then too.

[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.180]
I was driving home.

[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.260]
Yeah, I heard it.

[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:36.980]
See, we heard it yesterday.

[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.180]
So we can't play it today.

[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.240]
I was driving home from Rob's studio.

[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.040]
Too long.

[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.580]
We can't play that on a morning show.

[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.460]
But I'll play something else for you, okay?

[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:45.680]
All right.

[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.020]
Okay, this is just for him.

[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:48.940]
And this is...

[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:49.900]
That was a dude.

[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:50.620]
Yeah.

[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.220]
That was a dude call.

[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:52.860]
Yeah, dude.

[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.340]
Well, here's O for that dude.

[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.800]
Here we come.

[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.720]
Shuffle down the street.

[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.640]
We gather use these markers.

[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.900]
Cause we gather you besties.

[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.340]
Hey, Harry, for old monkeys.

[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.120]
That's you, dog.

[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.080]
Wanna show?

[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:15.240]
Oh, yeah.

[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.720]
That's you, dog.

[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:16.720]

[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:16.720]

[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.060]
That's you, dog.

[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.820]
That's you, dog.

[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.860]
That's you, dog.

[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:20.180]
That's you, dog.

[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:20.180]

[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:20.180]

[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:20.780]
That's you, dog.

[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:22.800]

[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.840]
That's you, dog.

[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:40.940]
I don't want any feels here.

[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.240]
It's just so dull and tiring.

[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:44.240]

[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:44.240]

[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:44.240]

[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:44.360]
It's all the same.

[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:44.360]

[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.960]
Free that Darth Hіgcheerful first...

[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.440]
It's even better that you don't have to, Jack.

[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.100]
Well, am I your uncle's sex ninja?

[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:52.260]
Again.

[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:52.260]

[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:52.260]

[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:52.300]
球 för Danishen.

[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:52.700]
Detoke and choose member keyword.

[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.560]
Watch it.

[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:54.760]
Yeah, just love me.

[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:54.820]
If somebody wants to remember that.

[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:54.820]

[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:54.820]

[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.120]
and everything goes away.

[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.240]
Now did it run on there?

[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.400]
Everything ran on there.

[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:00.840]
Everything's fine.

[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.280]
We couldn't hear anything in here.

[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.880]
What did button did you hit?

[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.040]
The solo button.

[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.480]
Well, don't push anymore, okay?

[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.420]
I didn't.

[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.100]
Okay. See what happens when we get food in here, kids?

[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:12.920]
It was a mistake.

[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.080]
All right.

[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:14.880]
A mistake.

[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:15.560]
Okay.

[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:16.800]
Well, you freak me out.

[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.060]
Well, when, you know, I know it's crazy, Dave,

[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.820]
but when everything goes away,

[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.040]
when you're sitting here,

[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.600]
I don't know why I freak out,

[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.720]
but when the entire program goes off the air,

[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.060]
you didn't go off the air.

[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:32.860]
No, no problem.

[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.720]
Well, I didn't know that though, it went off here.

[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:36.620]
I didn't know that.

[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.020]
We're trying to solve monkeys on the radio.

[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.980]
Okay. Well, I think it's pretty incredible,

[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.840]
on your day, that we're already already to O and P.

[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.880]
And we started today at six o'clock this morning,

[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.640]
and here it is 9.45 and we're at P.

[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.660]
Well, we can get rid of OP by playing

[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.840]
when there's any Griffith ones again.

[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.400]
No, I got an OP.

[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.400]
I see.

[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.760]
I see he did study that show.

[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.400]
Shall we take a couple more calls before we,

[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:02.560]
before we, we push that button.

[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.600]
We talked about battle.

[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.120]
Okay.

[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.520]
Oh, man.

[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.900]
Oh, no.

[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.020]
Oh, no.

[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:11.260]
Oh, no.

[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:11.320]
Oh, no.

[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:11.660]
Oh, no.

[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:12.300]
Hi.

[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.740]
One just a heart.

[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:15.760]
How are you?

[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.420]
I'm fine.

[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:17.800]
What's up today?

[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.760]
Okay, I was calling to ask you.

[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.560]
I can't either struggling.

[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.200]
We're struggling.

[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.500]
You can tell in the nerve voices.

[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.480]
Okay, also I wanted to ask David.

[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:31.380]
Yes.

[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:33.960]
Has anybody ever walked up to him and called him Machi?

[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.440]
Yeah, about twice a day.

[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:37.480]
Twice a day?

[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:39.860]
What does that mean?

[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.940]
No, that's a private term used among a small group of people.

[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.300]
Uh-huh, and it means what?

[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.760]
It means happy.

[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:49.600]
Oh, it does.

[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.540]
I've never heard that before.

[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:51.940]
Yeah.

[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.280]
I've never heard that before.

[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.500]
Yeah, are you a happy person?

[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:54.920]
No.

[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.160]
You're not?

[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.260]
What's wrong?

[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.200]
I have a lot of happy friends though.

[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.660]
Oh, this is that bitch that called about a week ago.

[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:03.380]
What?

[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.440]
Do you hear what he called you?

[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.040]
I heard what he called me.

[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.920]
No one that calls and said I like to laugh and he called me that.

[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.900]
Oh, and then I got you confused with somebody else.

[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:14.280]
I sure hope not.

[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:14.680]
Good.

[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.480]
Good Lord.

[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.700]
But anyway, I'm the one that also calls when you guys are there alone, when nails are not

[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.400]
there because I can never get through with nails there.

[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.520]
Yeah, a lot of people say that.

[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.880]
I thought I wanted to get through when he's there either.

[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:24.500]
Uh-oh.

[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.500]
Well, we're glad you're listening anyway.

[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.560]
Yeah, well, can I say hi to my cousin, Cuz.

[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.240]
Sure.

[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:30.360]
Hi Cuz.

[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:31.800]
All right.

[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:32.720]
See you later.

[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.140]
Bye.

[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.980]
I don't know about that call.

[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.540]
I think it was that same drill.

[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:38.900]
Really?

[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:39.740]
Yeah.

[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.860]
We have time just to take a...

[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:43.220]
Whoops.

[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.540]
Fort Lauderdale hung up.

[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:51.020]
Have you could have seen when I hit that dial tone and kept the...

[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:51.640]
Oh, I remember you brought up that a hard time.

[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.900]
He almost hit the ceiling.

[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.860]
My left ear was still out.

[00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.920]
It was just amazing.

[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.520]
Miami, North Miami.

[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:01.940]
Hello.

[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:02.720]
Glad.

[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:03.420]
Yeah, hi.

[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:03.920]
How you doing?

[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:04.360]
Okay.

[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:08.580]
We ran into that bit with the puse, uh, the yellow swimmer or he was swimming in.

[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.520]
You know, we found that yesterday.

[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.600]
Johnny and I were alphabetizing and cleaning out the bits.

[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:14.940]
Yeah.

[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.980]
And we will play it one day this week.

[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:17.880]
I don't have time.

[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:18.680]
It's very long.

[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:19.860]
Yeah, it's been long.

[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.200]
Yeah, we had lost that since last summer.

[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.280]
I don't know what that is.

[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.840]
Yeah, Dave doesn't even know what it is.

[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.420]
That thing about Frank Sinatra, that's what you're talking about, right?

[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:27.820]
Uh-huh.

[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:28.060]
Yeah.

[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:28.420]
Yeah.

[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:28.460]

[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:28.640]
Yeah.

[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.240]
I will play it before Neil comes back.

[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.780]
I'll play it one day this week, okay?

[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:32.440]
Oh, tie.

[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:32.960]
All right.

[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.280]
Very interesting suggestion.

[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.500]
And it really was.

[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.860]
948 and we have a call from Cooper City, Dave.

[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:41.260]
Hello.

[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.340]
Hello, Cooper City.

[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.000]
It's not on.

[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.420]
Yeah, how you doing, guys?

[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:47.260]
He's here.

[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:47.880]
How you doing?

[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:48.620]
All right.

[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:49.460]
What's up?

[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:51.400]
What?

[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:51.940]
Hello?

[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.160]
This is the lead zappling guy.

[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.480]
Are you the lead zappling guy?

[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:55.960]
Yeah.

[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.500]
And we want now.

[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.080]
This is saying hi again.

[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.000]
Yeah, well, go, go to hell.

[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.360]
Good, man.

[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.480]
What's going on here?

[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.960]
All these airheads are calling them.

[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.240]
I know.

[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.760]
As soon as you brought the food in, everything was great until you brought the food.

[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.600]
Hey, man.

[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:11.360]
How you doing?

[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.480]
Well, no more of those.

[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.340]
Get ready for the news and I'll talk about it.

[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.120]
That's that gentleman, man.

[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.240]
It is Tuesday night.

[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:20.140]
Like I started to say a few minutes ago and that means it's lobster night at shells tonight.

[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:20.760]
That's right.

[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.480]
It's lobster night at shells every Tuesday night.

[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.460]
Live, one and a quarter pound live, main lobsters.

[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.040]
Now they have just boarded the morning Delta airline flight out of Banger.

[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.680]
And they're scheduled to land a Miami International Airport later this afternoon.

[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:33.960]
Do you know what time kept the day?

[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.300]
Are you going to meet them or anything?

[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.960]
Well, they don't have to go through customs.

[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.420]
Now, shells are starting to prepare for their arrival and they'll serve them steaming hot to your table tonight.

[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:51.040]
And you're not going to believe this only 9.95 and you get parsely potatoes and just a little lettuce.

[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:52.620]
But it's a couple of leaves.

[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.280]
Okay.

[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.400]
Now these are full one and a quarter pound main lobsters.

[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.300]
Not those small one pound chicken lobsters.

[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:03.160]
Full one and a quarter pound lobsters that were swimming in the Atlantic this morning.

[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:07.920]
And they'll be served steaming to your table tonight or the unbelievable price of 9.95.

[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.800]
Shells turns every Tuesday into a nightly shell liberation.

[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:17.840]
That's what it says with one and a quarter pound main lobsters for only 9.95.

[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.100]
They have locations all over Dayton, Broward there and now open in Coconut Creek at the corner of coconut creek Parkway and Lions Road.

[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.000]
And that is in the coconut creek shock.

[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.260]
Coconut Creek shock.

[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.020]
Coconut Creek.

[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.080]
That's that kid that was on the phone just in the morning.

[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:30.360]
Yeah.

[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.820]
That one is open.

[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.640]
Alright, it's 9.50 Captain Day.

[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.140]
Boy, good luck to you.

[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.160]
Is this nuts here today?

[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:38.260]
Gotta go pee pee.

[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.020]
Oh, what is that?

[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.380]
Just a beside all your mind and up in a pee pee.

[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:45.900]
Now, I can't believe that's the bed you're going to use to the new to's.

[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.160]
You don't want to take a lobster to weigh a pound?

[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:48.880]
Seven years.

[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:49.720]
Wow.

[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.720]
That means these lobsters are like seven and a quarter years old.

[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.860]
Give me a break.

[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.920]
As old as the regular administration.

[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.080]
Right.

[00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:58.820]
Get out of here.

[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.600]
Elvis Presley fans are remembering their idol today.

[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.600]
11 years after the man called the king a rock and roll died.

[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.660]
Of course, we'll always remember that tragic episode when he rescued those people from that burning building.

[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.600]
He paid for it with his life.

[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.140]
Some 5,000 of them are expected to the Presley mansion in Memphis.

[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.720]
Ceremonies began last night with a candlelight procession.

[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:25.280]
The grounds of Graceland are lined with flower arrangement, some shape like guitars.

[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.560]
A high school buddy of Elvis claims ownership of a rare item.

[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:34.340]
A highly coveted two song record that Presley made for his mom in 53,

[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.080]
which led directly to his discovery at Sun Records.

[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.500]
You know that old legendary story?

[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.700]
Well, Edwin S. Leake Jr.

[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.300]
Not to be confused with his father, Edwin S. Leake.

[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:48.440]
Says the record was left at his grandmother's house in Memphis 25 years ago, Elvis.

[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.420]
And says Elvis later told him just to hold on to it.

[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:57.280]
Well, Elvis experts extolled a little disc as perhaps the single most valuable record in record collecting.

[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.880]
What did you say it was like?

[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.640]
Monolisa of records.

[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.480]
The Monolisa of records.

[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.940]
The experts add that everything checks out as legit with Leake,

[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:10.020]
who says he now wants to know what his prize possession is worth and you were saying it's estimated at what point.

[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.280]
Half million or Johnny Dyer said.

[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:12.580]
Half a million bucks.

[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.580]
Bet you'd go this up after now that people know it's around.

[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.740]
Well, so far the controversial film, the last temptation of Christ,

[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.740]
is raking in dollars at the box office.

[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:25.060]
But fundamentalists who oppose it say universal pictures will suffer in the long run.

[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:28.500]
In the first three days, the movie took in more than 400,000 bucks.

[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.660]
But one protest leader says as time goes on, angry churchgoers will hurt universal in the wallet.

[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.360]
Wow, that would really hurt.

[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.720]
Here's a statistic as you probably don't know.

[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:46.340]
There was a baby boom in America last year with more than three million new arrivals in 1987.

[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.460]
That's the most new new borns we've had in one year since 1964.

[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:51.520]
I believe it.

[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.080]
Isn't that some lot?

[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.640]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.800]
You saw pregnant women everywhere.

[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:57.880]
That's true.

[00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.240]
Pregnant women everywhere.

[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:00.760]
It's true.

[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.380]
Got the airport or something?

[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:03.300]
That's absolutely true.

[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.580]
You guys know.

[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.140]
The million of those little whippers.

[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.580]
Where you look, pregnant woman.

[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.020]
There's something sexy about a pregnant woman.

[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:12.880]
I don't know what it is.

[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:13.300]
It's true.

[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:14.580]
I've always thought that.

[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.800]
It's going to be mostly cloudy with showers and thunderstorms likely.

[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.940]
The high today, they're saying 87, but as Glenn was mentioning,

[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.480]
probably won't get much over 80 with this overcast.

[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:27.320]
We have 60% chance of rain, 30 to night, 50, 50 chance tomorrow,

[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.340]
low tonight, 77.

[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:29.380]
Right now it's 81.

[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.140]
It's eight of four.

[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.100]
It's 953.

[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.520]
Couldn't possibly be more tasteless.

[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.520]
An aval apral even.

[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.160]
An atreane bound for Brooklyn.

[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.720]
I met this year accountant.

[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.320]
Give her both your tady schmoo.

[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:43.940]
That's right.

[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:46.300]
It's the cat-skill cowboy himself.

[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.020]
Dr. Irving Paycheck.

[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.460]
Singing the all-time greatest hits of Nashville.

[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.680]
I still hear fear counten.

[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.340]
You gotta know how to beat him.

[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.880]
No how to cheat him.

[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.320]
If you wanna live your good life.

[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.500]
Deepa seconds, say that book.

[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.080]
And who could forget this flavorful cut?

[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.400]
Looking for locks in all their own places.

[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.100]
Looking for locks I'd buy by the cases.

[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.640]
Quality stuff.

[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.900]
Be sure there's no cases,

[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.540]
a bones or two, my soul.

[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.760]
And no collection of old country music would be complete.

[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.120]
Without Dr. Irving Paycheck's dietary classic.

[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.900]
I've excosion.

[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.600]
Bemkoche, Bosn, Koo.

[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.220]
Yes, Crapco Records proudly presents

[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:39.800]
Those not Miami blues.

[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.280]
To order notchville hits,

[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:42.600]

[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.200]
Excuse me.

[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.400]
Irving Paycheck is P.

[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.160]
Huge are gonna be tough.

[00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:59.640]
The queues are gonna be tough tomorrow.

[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.340]
I'm so grateful.

[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.540]
Tackle those, Timara.

[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.780]
And I knew he would not let us down, Dave.

[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.700]
If you'll push the button there for the phone.

[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.000]
Here's EJ.

[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:15.120]

Do it over there. Oh, we're hanging in there. What are you doing in Naples? Oh, man?

[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:32.640]
Everything is gonna stay sunny for more than two hours

[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:34.920]
Well, maybe tomorrow

[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:42.940]
Geez, I'm like God work good six days a week. I got eight days eight hours off and you know like to appreciate those eight hours

We would never believe but this is this summer we're having here in Florida

[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.020]
They're very imvious all over the country

[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:57.920]
Well, it's like a hundred degrees all over the country or more. Yeah, it was 97 in NYC yesterday

[00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.360]
And

[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.720]
Yeah, it's a little muggy, but you know, it's not hot and oppressive

[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:11.080]
Like it is, but you know, it seemed like when you call all the way from Naples we could talk about something besides the weather, you know

[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.460]
Yeah, you're right. Listen when I need to know I call Zeta
