[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]
At 505, the temperature in South Florida's 82 degrees, I'm Bill McQuig.

[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:12.100]
For news, frequent weather and exclusive jet-cofter traffic, it's 610 WIOD depend on it.

[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.140]
And now, live to WIOD's new talk studio for a major news conference.

[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.460]
Here's Vice President and General Manager of WIOD and WGTR, Mike Disney.

[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:32.720]
I am extremely excited and proud to announce the signing of a major personality in South Florida to news talk radio 610 WIOD.

[00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.880]
Neil Rogers has agreed to join the greatest lineup in talk radio in the country starting next Monday morning.

[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.300]
Neil will follow 13 year morning veteran Mike Rennery at 10 a.m. each weekday morning.

[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.560]
He will be the lead in to the market's top afternoon drive, Taukho Steve Kane.

[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.720]
We believe this to be the strongest talk lineup, not only in South Florida, but in the entire country.

[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.780]
The signing of Neil Rogers gives WIOD the market's number one morning, midday and afternoon drive Taukho's.

[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.220]
And with the Miami dolphins and the Miami Hurricanes play by play, it certainly makes WIOD the leading AM station in South Florida.

[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:17.080]
Neil, congratulations. Welcome aboard and now let's Steve Kane, Mike Rennery, Glen Hill and you take over on 610 WIOD.

[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.260]
That was impressive, wasn't it? Wasn't that fabulous? Let's hear it from Mike. Now what do you think he's going to be on, Mike?

[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.620]
I think this man has a big future in broadcast. He's really done.

[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.680]
Mike, sit down here. Sit down. So your shift is safe, Mike.

[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.320]
I want to congratulate you.

[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.060]
I think there's been an oversight here when they said we're signing a single major personality.

[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.080]
I think Dr. Glen Hill is joining the staff here. Doctor? Doctor? Well, I made you a doctor here.

[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.980]
You look like a doctor with those glasses. You've always said very kind things about me over the years, Steve.

[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.440]
I certainly have noticed that. Just when? And I met every single one of the people.

[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.100]
I mean everything that I say over the radio. Wow. More or less.

[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.900]
It's good to have you aboard.

[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.040]
Well, thank you, Steve. And that exciting, it seems like only just moments ago we were on the air and it's depressing.

[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.840]
More of a studio and just couldn't wait. The last half hour was like the last 20 years of my career.

[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.000]
It just went on and on and on. And I said, what kind of a douchebag places is it?

[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.800]
See, we got that in there right away. Right. Just douchebag.

[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.040]
I think it's douchebag. It's a douchebag.

[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.000]
How do you like that for changing his image? I would never say douchebag.

[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.760]
We only been here two minutes and already rubbing off on Renier here.

[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.360]
It's a new era. That's the revolution.

[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.580]
Wait, did you see the kind of crowd that's going to come hanging out in your restaurant?

[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:47.980]
No, wait, the only thing I can say is I have heard from time to time that maybe you have said some unkind things.

[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.940]
Not true about moi. Not true. The only thing we said and I am proud of you.

[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.260]
You know that he stood outside. Seriously, he stood outside at Studio Window for 20 minutes getting that finger.

[00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.700]
That's the finger right out of his left nostril. And I'm proud of that.

[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.120]
I heard myself. Okay, my pick your nose. Okay, well, it's now my turn.

[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.660]
I'm going to get excited. I want to say this moment.

[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.000]
Let me just wait a minute. Can I say this? Yeah.

[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.780]
Because you know, I'm sure you think this I am the member of the Giron shot.

[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.980]
I am Mr. Ego. Oh, Mr. Ego.

[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.760]
Do you know now when I introduce myself at the Miami arena at the wrestling matches?

[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.660]
I introduce myself as Mr. Ego Steve Kane. And they boot like crazy.

[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.960]
That's only because I say from WIOD, the Miami Dolphin's Day.

[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.700]
They really boot like crazy. Yeah, I kind of cover myself.

[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.020]
But what I was going to say is as you know, Neil, I am the therapeutic one.

[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.760]
I think it's important that we're not going to be therapy now.

[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.900]
No, you see that from Monday.

[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.680]
Do you remember the last thing we did therapy? I ended up with no clothes on in the studio.

[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.980]
Oh, God. Anyway, frightening moment. We won't really.

[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.540]
We won't really bring back the little things.

[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.600]
I think it's important that we take this opportunity.

[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.680]
Given the opportunity, Steve gets like a douchebag, doesn't he?

[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.040]
You really get into it. Can I just say this?

[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.040]
I think it's important that we get it all out on the table in this hour and all these hostilities.

[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.980]
Like for example, the hostility mic that you just expressed towards Neil.

[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.500]
Now I am the time to get it out there.

[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.960]
And we can invite Patty Murray to come in too from the app.

[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.100]
Oh, I'm about to say she should say that I suggested that.

[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.080]
Let her get it out of resistance.

[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.400]
I did suggest that I won't tell you what she said.

[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.980]
Because it ever gets out of resistance.

[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.800]
I'm actually where two sizes smaller. Okay.

[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.540]
I got to take this an isolate. Let me take a good sense of you.

[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.860]
I got to take something. This is a Christmas party we can charge admission for.

[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.680]
I can promise you.

[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.400]
Anyway, is there anything you, Mike, will you put out that?

[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.140]
It's against the rules. Will you get the cigarette police in here please for this man?

[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.620]
I'm allergic. This is a really hostile act, Mike.

[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.780]
Do you know that? Why are you hostile?

[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.800]
No, I'm not being hostile.

[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.040]
You are being hostile. Trust me. You're being paranoid.

[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.000]
Trust basically a douchebag.

[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.380]
You hung up on that word.

[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.060]
You need this? Is it you uncomfortable here?

[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.760]
Yes. Okay. Well, I'm not a smoker.

[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.260]
I thought I was an honest answer.

[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.480]
That was an honest answer. He's uncomfortable.

[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.480]
You would rather smoke than be in your presence.

[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.160]
That's what he said.

[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.080]
Quite frankly, Mike.

[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.060]
If I have to do both, I'll split the difference in smoke.

[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.020]
I mean, uh...

[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.100]
Hey, put that cigarette out.

[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.780]
Get out of here.

[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.460]
Now, so there's nothing you want to get off your trip.

[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.880]
Glenn, did you say something about therapy a moment ago?

[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.680]
You're into it. You believe in that, don't you?

[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.260]
Uh, now, does this have something to do with Michael Desisto?

[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.080]
Tell me the truth.

[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.760]
Oh, gee. Don't you know?

[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.820]
I want you to know Michael speaks very well of you now.

[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.120]
Does he really? He's a big fan of you.

[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.140]
Now, this means we get the neat Michael Desisto, right?

[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.920]
Absolutely.

[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.580]
It's a great way to make exchange.

[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.640]
We brought for you Monday.

[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.280]
He's going to be here in person in the studio.

[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.860]
Dr. Vott, and he will be here with the Monday.

[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.320]
And it'll be the end of this joint, I'm telling you.

[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.260]
But Michael, you actually would like to be a guest on the Neil Rogers show.

[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.880]
What are you really?

[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.680]
Good luck to do. Good luck to him.

[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.080]
Good luck to him.

[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.680]
Monday, Monday. What can we look for Monday?

[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.860]
Well, we haven't even told anybody anything.

[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.960]
Now, did Mr. Hodgeout over here? Did he tell anybody what time I'm going to be on?

[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.820]
Or did he tell me?

[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.320]
Yes, he did.

[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.480]
Oh, man. You did say that.

[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.440]
He said you were going to be the lead.

[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.320]
He said you were going to lead.

[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.400]
And I said, the number one afternoon, I take that back.

[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.500]
It's nobody's perfect.

[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.960]
Anyway, tentative, right?

[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.480]
You don't have to show it to me.

[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.100]
Don't start getting defensive already.

[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.960]
I worked for plenty of defensive management in this market.

[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.100]
Trust me. Look, what this is.

[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.460]
This is going to be.

[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.740]
Can I say Dennis Collins on here?

[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.420]
Can I just say that?

[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.340]
What is it you would like to say about Mr. Collins?

[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.440]
I just want to say the name.

[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.160]
You just want to say the name?

[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.220]
You're coming from an environment.

[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.700]
We can't say anything, OK?

[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.440]
Get it all out of your system.

[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.620]
Dennis Collins.

[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.520]
Do they come good?

[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.140]
Yes, they do.

[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.560]
One time.

[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.260]
Dennis Collins.

[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.060]
Anything else you want?

[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.880]
How about Alice?

[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.220]
Alice Rantell.

[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.760]
Oh, you can't tell me.

[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.100]
And we don't want to pick on Sandy, because he worked with Sandy for a long time.

[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.460]
And they don't have the same.

[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.520]
Right.

[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.280]
Sustoos, nice and cheerful.

[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.280]
You guys were together.

[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.360]
Yeah, right?

[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.940]
That's the right.

[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.580]
And I have a feeling that every now and then he thinks about Jack from the beach.

[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.780]
Hello, lovely lady.

[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.580]
No, I'm sure.

[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.660]
Once in a great while and is a deepest sleep, Jack from the beach's voice comes back.

[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.340]
I think his recesses of his whatever.

[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.700]
I think he's struck a nerve.

[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.580]
I think we struck a rock out of that one.

[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.640]
How can you tell?

[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.900]
Because he's smoking sugar at the same time and passively.

[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.940]
He really does puff on those cancers.

[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.020]
I mean, I've got to take my whole nose.

[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.020]
I think we'll be doing more in the next episode.

[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.600]
Is this really irritating you?

[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.680]
I swear I wouldn't kid you.

[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.760]
I swear I wouldn't joke you.

[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.380]
I wouldn't joke you.

[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.600]
It really is horrible for me.

[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.980]
You love it, don't you?

[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.460]
Yes, I do.

[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.580]
He's happy.

[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.700]
This is going to be interesting.

[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.360]
This is by the way.

[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.760]
You were the only one that was possible.

[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.620]
I want to sound like a butt liquor and ingratiating all of today for a couple of minutes we will be.

[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.240]
What the hell?

[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.860]
But then Monday will tell the truth.

[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.680]
But the bottom line is this is the most incredible building.

[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.540]
This is a real reason we came over here is because Mitch Wien is the chief engineer.

[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.960]
The best engineer in America, Barnano.

[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.340]
Okay, trust me when I tell you.

[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.320]
And I have worked with some of the most in-epped and incompetent engineers.

[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.500]
Recently as a matter of fact.

[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:45.860]
Yes.

[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.060]
And I just want to tell you that it's paradise.

[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.280]
And that's why you came over.

[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.260]
Yeah, I thought it was for the money.

[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.200]
Well, I was a part of it.

[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.420]
I had to work with me.

[00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:00.280]
That was a very big part of it because what the audience doesn't know is that Steve and I for the past six months have secretly been lovers.

[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.700]
We might as well now is the time to put it on the table.

[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.060]
Exactly.

[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.120]
So does Steve.

[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.560]
We are going to tell stories Monday.

[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.760]
If you want to know what we're going to do Monday, we're going to tell stories that have been too hot for us to tell on Zeta 4.

[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.200]
But we can tell them too hot.

[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.200]
Well, yeah, too hot.

[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.360]
Like about the two theory and stuff like that.

[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.120]
I mean, anything was too hot for us to tell.

[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:22.260]
Yeah.

[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.380]
Now we're going to tell stories that were just too sensitive to tell that they would freak out and have heart attacks.

[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.140]
So we can tell them on this air.

[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.500]
And we are going to tell stories Monday.

[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.460]
Steve, they will curl your hair.

[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:33.880]

[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.760]
I'm going to absolutely kind of wait.

[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.020]
In fact, I've got to tell you one thing.

[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:40.800]
Guys, now that you work here at WID, Mike Disney, our very fine boss and Bill Wise.

[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.100]
Total freedom.

[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.080]
I mean, anything and everything.

[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.120]
Bill Wise called me in the opposite of Steve.

[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.420]
He says, it's crazy as you want to get.

[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.440]
You can name the names, say whatever you want to say.

[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.040]
Total freedom.

[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.320]
Matter of fact, I know Steve has got the George Carlin album queued up in the other room.

[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.320]
The seven B.A.I. in case you got a cute, pretty good problem.

[00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.440]
But we are.

[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.460]
We're going to tell stories.

[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.480]
It is going to be an issue.

[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.000]
No, for those that are worried about what?

[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.060]
About tales of the Vienna.

[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.000]
Our war days at Zeta 4.

[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.300]
Things that went on behind the scenes.

[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.680]
You're telling them, Rene Rene, he doesn't even know what Zeta 4 is.

[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:15.760]
Oh, I've heard you know.

[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:16.520]
Zeta 4.

[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:16.980]
I have not yet.

[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.920]
I have not yet.

[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.920]
If he had the gun to his head.

[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.060]
Obviously, not as many other people did either.

[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.780]
But that's not in the morning, though.

[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.560]
On the morning.

[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.020]
Of course, you're on Zeta 4.

[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.300]
And we're listening to our station while you were on your line.

[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.180]
Do you know we now have this is an interesting thing.

[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:30.880]
It's just struck me.

[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.360]
We now, for the first time, have a radio station that can really do a genuine battle of the talk shows.

[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.580]
We got the total.

[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.640]
I thought that was the real thing.

[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:40.640]

[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:12.160]
Primer is fierce excellent serve as you as we say in don't start with that next up

[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.900]
All right now what was the question all about Alice yeah now what was this a challenge?

[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.160]
An ultimate what do you mean an ultimate and what the hell does that mean what you want to know what it means?

[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:27.100]
It means evidently just in case in case this particular reporter that's because I was just gonna say that he has issued an

[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.420]
Ultimatum that he's not gonna let you attack his self-esteem anymore or something

[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:36.140]
What does that mean attack his self-esteem? How can you attack what a person doesn't have right no?

[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:41.900]
But what the hell is that mean Alice it means he is desperate and he wants us to talk about I mean you know something

[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:47.160]
I think we should do it. I think we'll excuse me. No, I think we ought to talk about Alice. You're right

[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.060]
I think I think it's the least we can do because quite frankly

[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:57.860]
He's the only vestige of anything which isn't much that's hanging on over there by a thread and basically when they start playing Chinese melodies on Monday

[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.200]
I don't know if you'll fit the form to do two seconds of your Jerry witchner do your Jerry

[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.460]
Oh, no, I'm not doing Jerry. Oh come on while Mike is here

[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:09.620]
I don't know Craig were they know but that's later on

[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:17.600]
Anyway, so you know everybody want that you want everybody in this business. Yes, seriously

[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.300]
You already owe me upfront because everybody in this business and maybe a lot of them have diaries, you know

[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:27.480]
Our listening right now everybody in this market. Yeah, there's no question of them

[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:33.000]
At them I guarantee you that even while he's on the air your buddy Lee is list is monitoring the show as we speak

[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.360]
I spoke to Lee this morning and he is

[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:41.240]
Dissterically happy about this for us and he is absolutely Lee Valor and we count on some of those famous calls

[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.480]
We can well he can't because he's on the end disposed

[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.260]
End of two he's in the show you mean from you. Oh, yeah, who you'll call you absolutely

[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.180]
Well, that'll be great won't I am sure that everybody there's something we got it

[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.940]
We have to get straight because everybody comes to me and says you would neo working together you two guys hate each other

[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:05.160]
I think it's I think it's appropriate at this moment that you tell the audience exactly how you feel about me and

[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.000]
I love Steve passionately and I always have had the secret thing

[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.780]
Well since he shaved his beard I must say he's not as cute as he used to be no

[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.300]
You know what do you know why I shaved my beard? It has to do with you as a matter of fact

[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.260]
That's really you know why you got on there

[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.820]
Remember we ran into each other that night up at that Chinese restaurant

[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:26.040]
And I heard a terrible thing that you said about me at the Chinese restaurant about how they said I was some kind of a slime ball and

[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.320]
No, how dare I go up here and eat there one ton soup with

[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.740]
Don't you believe that wasn't true at all

[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.760]
Okay, Mr. Neal and I ran into it. This was a sponsor that I had that was a great place by the way

[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:42.580]
In fact, absolutely KT and I were up there at the depot and you were up there trying to steal a sponsor with stand as I remember

[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.740]
And and you got on the air the next day and you said a cane looks so old like you

[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:49.260]
Daged

[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:55.060]
You know because my beard had granite no you didn't look good and I got up the next way I look at the mirror and I said my god

[00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:00.360]
Neil is right and I took my razor is always right. I took well let's not put your time

[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:06.500]
I took my razor and I was in choice between cutting my wrist or shaving my beard and I decided to shave my beard

[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:12.460]
And I've been clean shaving ever so others I'm responsible for absolutely and I do look 10 years younger. Did you have a beard?

[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.880]
Where we had a beard when I got here I never noticed I was now

[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.440]
Now

[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.220]
Man, it's out of it. He is out of it

[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:25.760]
We got him in the battle of the talk show. We had a letter of me now the talk show host all we have is where we all take off

[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.960]

[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.060]

We have to set a time limit on the concentration camp is

[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.300]
Seriously, I mean after the first six hours it's gonna be me turn you are a lot more near these nice guys

[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.040]
Yeah, you only heard people you love right? I mean you did a couple of too many issues on socks

[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.260]
But other than that he was all right. What were you gonna say? Well that passing gas show

[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:54.980]
We had a letter many many months ago. Steve a famous famous letter over at Zeta and at the a PS on the letter said PS

[00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:02.840]
Neil is right all about everything. I think my mother wrote that one. Yeah, no she did not and we remember that stuck with his for some reason

[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:07.160]
We have found out over the years years. I've worked with Neil that basically he is right

[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.400]
We're never able to do now and it's this is proven this is great. This is proven. I think by your beard story

[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.400]
Yeah, well he was right on the good. I'm telling you what I really looked

[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.900]
You never have a beard no kidding

[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:24.160]
Do shevelled and gray and like aging and now you look like a bench look at this man

[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.960]
You know some of you lost weight you look fabulous

[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.020]
Like a rip man you never heard so much but looking

[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.720]
Neither one of us means award of it you know, but it's just a radio show

[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.660]
He lost weight if we can sit yeah, oh you're here. You had a beard and he lost

[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.160]
I've missed the hell of a lot here

[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.660]
This man you all have that anorexic look like you've got okay Mike. So just put it on

[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:52.820]
But anyway the people and the radio wars people never understood about the radio wars that it was it's fun

[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:57.560]
You love it don't you I love go that's so now wait a minute that was when your buddy like is was here, okay?

[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:03.640]
And

[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:09.220]
I don't have any idea now. I haven't got any idea I did see him on on with wartownie

[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.140]
And he was under with the Alan as a matter of fact and with who else who was under Jerry Williams

[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:18.840]
I'm sure we got another show Jerry was on with me when you sent him up with that information to sabotage me

[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:25.080]
Never pulled the trigger. Oh, I saw that you know about that. I saw that show. No, I don't know you don't know about that now

[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.820]
I'm impressed whoever does hope for his research that they seek doubt in

[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.480]
Yeah, I thought I was gonna find one Casanova the Casanova is Don web

[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:21.640]
Yeah, well done has a way with the ladies. They tell me second only to one of your favorite people who's that you know

Do we have to get started on him now? You're not gonna attack my good friend Rick. I wouldn't do that

[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.980]
Rick is a nice man and he speaks very well of you. I've heard yeah

[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.040]

It shows our appetite. I can make peace with

[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.700]

Oh a cider man. Oh, oh, I don't think that'll be happening soon

[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:09.460]
I think I think there's about as much chance of that happening is do caucus winning a massive victory next to me

[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.900]
I think it would be great. Are you looking forward to the Christmas party? I really am

When word got out that you were coming over here and no word got out well the word rumors rumors

[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.940]

Yeah, I think that the dolphins are weak in the hurricanes are

[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.920]
You know something else right you don't like the hurricane not at all now

[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.160]
I'm that in fact there was an article in the

[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.840]
St. P. Times that led into the editor about the hurricanes it from a Notre Dame

[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.760]
Fan uh-huh, and they went on and on about the stuff that happened before the game in the fist fights

[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:04.980]
Really?

[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.580]
a whole song and a dance and it was just like every every season we have the same kind of thing would you be Johnson?

[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:16.320]
Okay, I don't want to attack him this first day. I'm not even on the air. I'm just a guest right okay, but that wig for crying out loud

[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.660]
Already but you get along well with sir you get along well with Rick

[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:24.600]
I mean he looks like how do you do the and drag for crying out loud. What's that you get along with Rick?

[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.920]
Along with Rick is one of the great play by play. I've always said though

[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.820]
Yeah, one of the great play by playing out using the country's getting a little surly

[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.560]
But I don't blame him if you said that team to you know work with you'd be surly too

[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.100]
Hank is a good friend of mine. He's a fellow degenerate. He loves the track matter can be not you know

[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.340]
He's fat and he loves the track. What more does anybody need?

[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.040]
Yeah, and he keeps running out there to California allegedly to go to Prittikin and only wants to do is go to Santa

[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.700]
Need a Hollywood ever con you on that okay?

[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.160]
Joseph Jackie another one of your personal favorite to be in many comas

[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.700]
Is a nice guy

[00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:00.260]
We need to work on it voice over it is gonna be wild on Monday. We're coming out. We're pulling out all the stops

[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.060]
Yeah, and trust me. We're gonna say nice back

[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:09.400]
We're gonna say douchebag several times in fact Collins. We better find a new word because Reneerie has already stolen you like that

[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.980]
From us. Did you see how that appealed that he just gone nuts with that?

[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.780]
Like a child with a candle up three cigarettes in a row douchebag douchebag

[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.940]
He just never said douchebag on a radio

[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.860]
Until they're never a douchebag on a radio

[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.340]
Look because douchebag the thing you don't say on a radio

[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.140]
But don't you enjoy the freedom now that you said it

[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.220]
You feel like you've been emancipated not a parade in the 18th century not really

[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.320]
Whatever you say Mike

[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.780]
And Bill called he says

[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.980]
Man, it's been so quiet yet another cigarette you're lining up. I'm really suffering you love that right well

[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.480]
Mike is quiet. Anyway, what I was gonna say and I've started several times

[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:47.780]
But Mike keeps interrupting with douchebag is that now what does this mean Greg Buu del question mark who put that one?

[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:51.620]
Codone put that there. What does that mean? I guess he wants to know what you think that's appropriate

[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.780]
Don't you Greg Buu del question mark? I guess he bro

[00:23:54.780 --> 00:24:00.260]
One time is it that pretty well. Yeah, let's say there are people in this market who are celebrating tonight

[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:06.200]
Oh absolutely all these morning guys great they're gonna get these gigantic numbers now and what Greg's sunny

[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.680]
Yeah, my good friend Sonny am I say? Oh?

[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.720]
Greg I'm friendly with all the people I like sunny. I don't have any problem

[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.220]
Sonny is super gentle the dentist about 10 months ago, okay?

[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:21.760]
And I ran into sonny who was there at the same dentist and he was having a two-gram-a-boon bottle caps removed from his dentures and

[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:28.680]
No, seriously he admitted to me that he tapes my show every day and he listened to it when he got off the air

[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:33.120]
That is a groupie. Okay. I mean when you do five hours in a morning and you're taping the competitor

[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.220]
Shoes you go and listen to I mean that's an incredible groupie. I have no that's a douchebag

[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:44.100]
Okay, like I said that's a well I hate to tell you Greg be the other not have any ratings before Neil went on in the morning

[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.520]
Yeah, we just helped him along a little bit and we just heard him a little bit

[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.400]
He may come back in his last book just like do caucus in the polls

[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.960]
You know they peeking and all of a sudden I'm out speaking at the right time exactly

But then of course there are those who are tonight as we speak flashing their wrists. Yeah like

[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.080]
Well everybody at WNWS

[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:08.840]
You know you gotta feel better and the amazing part of it is they got that fluke book. Yeah, okay

[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.020]
They really did the summer book there was one month where they had like everybody in

[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:16.840]

His crybaby thing then he got nothing to cry about we just call him out. I would say that if we don't call him mr

[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:13.520]
Mr. Rantel mr. Rantel has a pretty much. So who is this guy you keep talking about right now? I don't

[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.700]
We got I don't know you don't know anybody in this morning. No, I have no

[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.140]
Just come and do your show go back go to sleep and that's it

[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.000]
We're gonna be by the way if you think that he doesn't bed rip off of me

[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.180]
Al if you can hear a laceter and Tampa man you would hear your hair out. He was one of the major

[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:31.200]
Jerks of the world. That is just incredible. Yeah nice voice, but no mom

[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:36.720]
Neil and I done totally different things were both in central Florida this past weekend and both of us heard laceter

[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.620]
You know and they got the he's on the FLA press with Tampa now

[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:46.500]
This is a news talk station with NBC news at the top of the hour and they have this incredible ID that comes on it goes

[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:51.380]
WFLA Tampa St. Petersburg lock it in rip off the knob

[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:59.220]
But he sounds like weird and then NBC News sounder comes on it so yeah, so we're a some truly incompetent talk to your host

[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.480]
Why we'll talk about that? Oh

[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.300]
Everybody we know we're gonna take a break

[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:10.500]
We want to send you and a guest to Hawaii for the pro bowl with Bob Kuchin burglarie Zonka for details on winning

[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:18.700]
Listen to micronary mornings or call Bob Kuchin burglarie an associate's a 3817890 now back to Steve Gaines on

[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:23.100]
Newstalk Radio 610 WIOD we are back

[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.680]
All right, now wait a minute. Let's get out of the enclosure

[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.260]
I got this stuff and a recent opportunity

[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:35.700]
I've got this new little gimmick here so I can limit my spots to 60 seconds

[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:40.980]
So I know we'll absolutely throw my pocket to death alarms by HRD

[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:44.640]
Now you always you know I heard you ask on here once why do I always start by giving them that

[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:50.240]
You always announces the name of the spot of the beginning always know that like a billboard which I guess is good

[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:55.640]
What do I think Mike has flipped a circuit here? What is going on Mike? What is the alarm? Is that was that what that was?

[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.260]
It sounded more like would see the old

[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:04.880]
Yeah, Tweety bird I gotta tell you that that wouldn't really do very much if I was a burglar breaking in I wouldn't

[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.660]
Wouldn't scare me a bit

[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:10.620]
Anyway, Sans have said a little talk much for a living

[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:18.300]
Did you know that 95% of the people that call alarms by HRD call and castle? Okay, forget the spot

[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:24.320]
It wouldn't surprise me after this can you can you please behave yourself?

[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.380]
Now I'm gonna hit this button again stop

[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:32.680]
Give me a 60 second and I want something like that you did for the depot it was like 15

[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:39.480]
13 I tie off the seat. It's a great place and the food is outrageous and you're always good in 15 seconds

[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.820]
They got an alarm by this John that he's talking about right now too. I know what it's like

[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:44.700]
We do like the other 40 seconds of getting their money

[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:49.980]
Go ahead you got to do this work back it up on time here and the sun is getting pretty upset. Okay

[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:56.520]
As I started to say before you realize by the way that when I came to this time I will get this in before the end of the show

[00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:00.960]
Don't worry. Yes, listen in 1976 March 1st. I'll never forget that horrible day

[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:06.080]
I came to the cat KAT and sunny was the sports director at KAT now here

[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:11.860]
We are 12 and a half years later and I walk in here at WIOD these palatial studios and there's sunny

[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:17.100]
Standing in a hallway looking the same the standing around doing nothing just like he did at the KAT

[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:22.660]
Was in crime hasn't changed a bit. He's a good guy. I'm really is. All right. And he speaks very well of you. I know

[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.500]
Allarms by HRD people you can trust

[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.040]
Now this is getting ponderous. Yeah, it's getting pretty stinking

[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.880]
He whizzed. Bip will you just be?

[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:36.260]
I'm not doing anything man. I'm not smoking. I'm not doing anything

[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:42.360]
Why risk losing the possessions of a lifetime every single thing of value you own your baseball cards your collectibles jewelry

[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.160]
Cash silver appliances

[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:47.780]
I don't have any baseball cards. I don't have any jewelry. I don't have any collectibles

[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:51.520]
Maybe even the life of your family. Why don't we do in the baseball car? You're white. What?

[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:56.060]
Do we have to look at baseball cards? Now I'll let you do that show again, but only if I'm here okay

[00:40:56.060 --> 00:41:01.460]
Will you do a baseball card? You're putting me on you made fun of them on the air you because it's a dreadful topic

[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.420]
But you put your into it

[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:08.420]
Yeah, and so are seven other people in the audience okay and four kids or under the age of three you're wrong

[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:13.820]
I've finished this bomb. A bomb's high HRD. Oh, this is one that got the alarms people you can trust

[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:16.960]
Now we had the first thing we did we moved into our new home

[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:22.040]
We had the great field safer alarm system put into that house and if anybody so much is trying to stick a

[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:40.800]
Excellent and not only that the little light goes on at your closest police station cops will be there in a matter of moments to arrest the perpetrator

[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.980]
