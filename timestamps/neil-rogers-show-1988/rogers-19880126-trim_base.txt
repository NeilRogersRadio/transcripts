[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380]
Rock and conditions, passive positions.

[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.140]
I am a trapping beast.

[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.600]
Someone who's sleepy,

[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.520]
someone who's keeping nothing in two days.

[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.200]
What?

[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.320]
Somebody first hands,

[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.440]
someone to first,

[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.960]
and then go back to sleep.

[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.400]
There is nothing I like better

[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.660]
than a joss on now and then

[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.380]
with the hands under the sweater

[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.660]
and the back that starts to bend.

[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.360]
But before my eyes are open,

[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.760]
I don't want to have to hide

[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.360]
from the simple times

[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.880]
still poking with the thimbleful of pride.

[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.140]
Boys, one, sex in the morning,

[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.920]
sex in the morning,

[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.980]
soiling the sheep.

[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.440]
Sex while I'm yawning,

[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.220]
suddenly spawning,

[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.900]
when I'm half a fleet.

[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.640]
Someone unconscious,

[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.740]
somebody not just waiting for a thre is one.

[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.640]
Sex with surprises,

[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.520]
sex with some rises,

[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.400]
someone on the pill.

[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.960]
There is nothing like a lover

[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.460]
who can satisfy your needs.

[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.100]
And the joy when you discover,

[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.100]
just how often he succeeds.

[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.980]
But before my eyes can focus,

[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.040]
I don't need him to surprise

[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.960]
by descending lights,

[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.060]
the most honest on a field of sleeping thoughts.

[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.940]
Boys, one, sex in the morning,

[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.740]
sex in the morning,

[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.740]
when I'm still not fresh,

[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.420]
something that strikes them,

[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.220]
someone who likes them,

[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.760]
fondling their flaws.

[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.800]
Someone who takes them,

[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.920]
someone who breaks,

[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.560]
and comment on their signs,

[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.440]
someone who pride in someone who not,

[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.720]
and then just close her eyes.

[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.260]
It's 11 after 8 on Zeta 4,

[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.720]
and it's Uncle Bonzai,

[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.540]
and boys want it in the morning.

[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.900]
And in the afternoon,

[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.720]
and in the evening,

[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.160]
and overnight,

[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.200]
it's a matter of fact, too.

[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.560]
Okay, and the movement right now,

[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.680]
you're not going to do that story.

[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.660]
Are you about the baby with the two faces?

[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.520]
No, but I know a lot of two-faced people,

[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.920]
but that's another story.

[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.840]
Okay, I don't need to,

[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.280]
because Camdenave has a great joke about that.

[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.040]
What is that?

[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.620]
About dancing cheek-to-cheek,

[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.140]
or something like that?

[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.900]
Something like that.

[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.140]
No, we're not going to say that on the day.

[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.900]
We're not going to do that.

[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.800]
I don't think.

[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.560]
It does conjure up some interesting images, though, doesn't it?

[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.460]
Moving right along,

[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.100]
we do have an open light in Broward.

[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.440]
Oh, boy, 7-7-9-3600.

[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.100]
That's the number in Broward.

[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.740]
7-7-9-3600.

[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.160]
I don't understand that story now.

[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.880]
How can you have two faces?

[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.140]
Wouldn't it be something

[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.180]
if we had Luke Christie in two faces, have I?

[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.660]
It's right in.

[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.200]
I bet you we have that.

[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.520]
We've played it, didn't we?

[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.040]
Lightning strikes.

[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.260]
Oh, I've played Lightning strikes.

[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.960]
I do have two faces, have I at home?

[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.940]
I can't bring my whole library in here.

[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.680]
Somebody played that for me recently.

[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.080]
Maybe we, I think it could be on one of those, uh...

[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.980]
Things in there.

[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.860]
I think your hip.

[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.640]
Really?

[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.500]
Well, thank you so much, Captain Dave.

[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.620]
Well, is it in the book?

[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.120]
Do we have like a, um...

[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.240]
Or is that only for artists and, uh...

[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.960]
What, albums?

[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.380]
Um...

[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.340]
God only knows, right?

[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.560]
Luke Christie.

[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.560]
Anthology.

[00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.760]
Anthology, great.

[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.280]
Does he looking?

[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.080]
Yeah.

[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.380]
That's a very...

[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.720]
It's like your various.

[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.240]
Ta da da da da da da.

[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.800]
Boy!

[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:11.560]
Have you got it?

[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.340]
Uh, well, it's gonna take a few minutes to look for it.

[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.860]
That's all right.

[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.760]
Thank you, Ty.

[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.620]
Oh, no, wait a minute, that doesn't answer the question though.

[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.480]
We have it?

[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.540]
Um, I've heard it somewhere.

[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.380]
Oh, come on.

[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.620]
813 on Zeta4, let's take another call from Miami

[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.800]
while he continues wasting time here.

[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.060]

[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.620]
Hello!

[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.300]
How you doing?

[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.960]
Um, I just wanted to tell you guys that girl

[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.640]
that called before me stole my line.

[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.120]
I wanted to request that song.

[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.000]
Isn't that great?

[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.900]
Yeah, one of my husband here.

[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.840]
Really?

[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.560]
Um, I wanted to tell you guys that I have a Jason

[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.320]
that was born on Friday the 13th.

[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.400]
Oh my God, boy.

[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.340]
That's a big...

[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.100]
Don't you want to change his name before it's too late?

[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.080]
No, he had to be a Jason.

[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.420]
I knew he was a boy, so he had to be a Jason.

[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.560]
But he was born on last year.

[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.120]
So he had a one month birthday Friday the 13th.

[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.900]
He also had a six month birthday Friday the 13th.

[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.740]
Mm-hmm.

[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.200]
So, do you have different style hockey masks in his room?

[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.420]
No, we agreed not to buy him any kind of, you know.

[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.240]
Yeah, I hope he doesn't want to be a goalie when he grows up.

[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.880]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.320]
I might be very effective.

[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.440]
I think the other team would all run in the other direction.

[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.460]
No, he's a good kid though.

[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.200]
That's great.

[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.680]
Yeah.

[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.300]
Just wait.

[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.700]
Well, I wanted to tell you guys I'm a first time caller.

[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.200]
Just wait until...

[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.640]
Just wait until he starts axing the neighbors.

[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.180]
Yeah.

[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.660]
And I don't mean axing him a question either.

[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.520]
He's a good kid.

[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.880]
Great.

[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.300]
I'm sure you're not prejudiced are you?

[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.420]
No, no.

[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.420]
Okay, well, I just want to call.

[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.200]
Well, happy birthday to Jason.

[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.360]
Okay, thanks.

[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.020]
And it's not too late to change it now.

[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.960]
Just give it some thought.

[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.400]
No, we can't change it.

[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.880]
Okay, but change it to something, you know, more comfortable, like Freddie maybe would be good.

[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.020]
Freddie, Freddie, yeah.

[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.960]
I have two other girls and they love that movie.

[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.160]
I'm wearing on Shabby before and five.

[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.580]
Freddie Cruz.

[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.300]
And they love him.

[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.780]
Well, of course, number the first Nightmare on Elm Street, Johnny Depp is in that movie.

[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.920]
I just mentioned that in passing because he's from Miramar, you know.

[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.260]
It's true.

[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.160]
Oh, okay.

[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.680]
Okay.

[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.980]
That's the only reason.

[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.500]
Trust me.

[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.200]
Have a great day.

[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.120]
Okay, you do.

[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.540]
Bye-bye.

[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.100]
Bye-bye.

[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.480]
815 on Zeta 4.

[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.520]
We have an open line in date at 620 3600.

[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.140]
The Johnny Depp fan club will be meeting at 11 o'clock this morning at Miramar High, gathering

[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.920]
around that life size, that full life poster.

[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.500]
Yeah.

[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.560]
Maybe it's, you know, how this Santa Rhea House here right in front of the station.

[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.920]
Maybe instead of that big statue of Mary, we could erect a giant statue of Johnny Depp.

[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.400]
Perfect.

[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.220]
We could what?

[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.820]
We could erect a giant statue of Johnny Depp.

[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.800]
And we could change the name instead of 207th Avenue.

[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.520]
Yeah.

[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.340]
Drive or whatever drive, whatever this is.

[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.500]
We could change it to Jump Street.

[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.280]
Hmm.

[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.680]
Wouldn't that be great?

[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.140]
207th Jump Street.

[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.280]
And this could be one.

[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.100]
And then that could be 21.

[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.440]
Wouldn't that be great?

[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.920]
So in other words, this would be a swine to Johnny Depp.

[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.140]
Well, we're not far from Miramar.

[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.340]
Are we?

[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.060]
No, we're right down the street.

[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.720]
Just a mile up the road is Miramar Parkway.

[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.100]
Well, my question is, we're not that far from the Miramar diner that it's, I drove by yesterday.

[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.860]
I do the ducks stay if we make it a geese.

[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.460]
I mean, do the geese stay around the swine like they do now?

[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.820]
No more of those crack jokes.

[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.260]
Okay.

[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.140]
Including the Oprah jokes.

[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.220]
By the way, you were very proud of us.

[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.640]
We told the Oprah joke to the crowd.

[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.680]
It's specs on Saturday.

[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.620]
They laughed.

[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.020]
Yeah.

[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.320]
Cracked them up.

[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.160]
It's 817 I'm saying before.

[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.440]
And moving right along, he's got car number one.

[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.960]
That was on here like an hour ago.

[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:45.980]
You didn't find Lou Christie.

[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.620]
You know, I really have something.

[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.040]
What a, what a difficult question that was.

[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.940]
I was only on this show.

[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.680]
What I hear a story, a six story like that.

[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.940]
And then go look for a song called Two Faces.

[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.440]
Have I?

[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.960]
And as I was looking for, I was going, what am I doing?

[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.140]
Did you find it?

[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:01.900]
We don't have it here.

[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.760]
Oh, God.

[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.700]
I haven't at home, though.

[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.660]
We'll bring it tomorrow.

[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.980]
I will certainly bring it.

[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.560]
Yeah, it's my second favorite.

[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.800]
Lou Christie, record next to Lightning Strikes, which of course is the greatest record in the history music.

[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.100]
Okay.

[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.380]
Let's take one from Broward.

[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.020]
We do have a Broward line open by the way.

[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.520]
That's a bad home in boys and girls.

[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.420]
7779 3600.

[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:19.780]
Okay.

[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.560]
We just mentioned that in passing.

[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:23.920]
7779 3600.

[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:24.620]
Broward County.

[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:24.900]
Hello.

[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.500]
Excellent.

[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.440]
That was a good call.

[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.400]
That's one of the best.

[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.300]
Best call of the day.

[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:31.700]
I think so.

[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.200]
Okay.

[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:32.860]
Day counter.

[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.040]
Let's see if we can match it and date.

[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:35.440]
Hello.

[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:36.200]
How you doing?

[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:36.800]
Fine.

[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.020]
You.

[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:37.580]
Okay.

[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.600]
How's the bird?

[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.300]
The bird is just fine as wine, sir.

[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:42.900]
Fine.

[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:43.980]
Captain Dave.

[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.600]
Captain Dave is, as in fact, speaking of wine.

[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.500]
He's got a little grandma boon in there for later on.

[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:50.720]
Yep.

[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.400]
Could you do me a favor?

[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.300]
What is that, sir?

[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.960]
You play a labimbo?

[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:55.980]
Labimbo?

[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:56.300]
Yeah.

[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.020]
Is that possible?

[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.140]
It's possible.

[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.760]
Anything is possible.

[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.180]
I was unlikely, but.

[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.500]
Come on.

[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.460]
No, we'll play it for you.

[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.260]
Let me find it.

[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.000]
I didn't go to work.

[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:06.880]
You're sick?

[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:07.340]
Yeah.

[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.460]
What's wrong?

[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.200]
Got a cold?

[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:09.440]
Yeah.

[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.240]
Yeah.

[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.580]
Well, this weather wouldn't help it.

[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.100]
Where is it?

[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.100]
White.

[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.460]
You know that.

[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.320]
Labimbo?

[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.860]
The, um, present-of-regan thing?

[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.000]
No, no, no, no.

[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.460]
No, no, no.

[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.420]
I, you know, I couldn't find Labimbo, uh, when I was looking for it.

[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.500]
Oh, did you find it?

[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.300]
That's because you're a monger, it's right here.

[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.880]
I got it, sir.

[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.480]
All right.

[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.300]
No problem.

[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.040]
Thank you.

[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:32.620]
Feel better.

[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.220]
Okay.

[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:33.840]
Bye-bye.

[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:35.820]
818-18-18-4.

[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.420]
You know, you've always come up with these excuses.

[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.480]
You can't find this.

[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.480]
You can't find that.

[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.020]
Yeah.

[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.180]
Yeah.

[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:47.420]

[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:47.540]

[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:47.800]

[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:47.800]

[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:47.800]

[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.420]
Yeah.

[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:50.580]

[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:50.980]

[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:51.500]
Yeah.

[00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:57.620]

[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:57.740]

[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:57.740]

[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:57.740]

[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:57.740]

[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.260]
Yeah.

[00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:58.260]

[00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:58.260]

[00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:58.260]

[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:58.440]

[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:58.440]

[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:58.440]

[00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:58.700]
Yeah.

[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:58.720]

[00:09:59.100 --> 00:09:59.100]

[00:09:59.100 --> 00:09:59.460]
Yeah.

[00:09:59.720 --> 00:09:59.960]
Yeah.

[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:01.940]
Yeah.

[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.060]
Oh man.

[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.480]
What's so clever?

[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:29.480]

[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:29.820]
That's how such things are.

[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:29.820]

[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:29.820]

[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:29.820]

[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.500]
Well, you know Charlie, I'm just here saying that I'm Modena so, there we go song,

[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.560]
Bimbo, bimbo, bimbo

[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.940]
I'm Ujo's other symbols

[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.220]
I'm Ujo's other symbols

[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.680]
Como Dala Rice

[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.140]
There's a heck of a bimbo

[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.240]
She spent the night on a boat

[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.060]
Go and some go and ship on

[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.740]
Come and take the President's chill

[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.600]
Fools around, eat with the race

[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.080]
Now you're wearing no excuses

[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.400]
Now you've got no excuses

[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.640]
You've got no class

[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.420]
You've got no shame

[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.540]
But lots of fame

[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.820]
Bimbo, bimbo

[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.040]
Heart and limbo

[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.640]
Bimbo, bimbo

[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.660]
Bimbo, bimbo

[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.460]
Bimbo

[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.580]
Bim

[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:28.580]

[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.660]
It's Rita, Rita, Rita, Jen Red

[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.640]
We love you, it's zombie island massacres

[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.040]
We're a top-of-art scrimmitarium

[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.800]
Really, and who's that over there that canassie one?

[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.060]
It's fawn

[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.100]
We look so pretty as you have to teach straight

[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.280]
And I use my sign with William Morris

[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.580]
And you want to be a TV-looser reporter

[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.080]
Well, you're really cool

[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.120]
Okay, now what was this you said?

[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.580]
They won't give you the money that you want

[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.540]
Is that what you just said?

[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.520]
Come on, let's bring it out in the open

[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.620]
Come on, let's stop with this cheap company

[00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.300]
All right

[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.800]
You know, they wait, they're having lunch

[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.440]
Finally, maybe with stand-of-day

[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.280]
They wait till about four days before his contract runs out

[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.180]
Playing fast and loose with his life

[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.380]
And then this mung brain over here

[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.820]
Doesn't want to give you the money that you want

[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.320]
Well, we still have

[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.360]
We'll just all walk out

[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.600]
It's, you know, very simple

[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.520]
Oh, I like that

[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.540]
No problem

[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.040]
We don't want to play hardass

[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.180]
It's 21 past eight

[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.400]
On Zade afforded

[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.000]
You say it was up to 50 already

[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.440]
That's like a heat-degrees

[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.200]
Wow, fair breezy cold, high upper

[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.180]
50s, maybe 60 if we're lucky

[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:31.840]
Oh, boy

[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.960]
But low to night in the mid to upper 30s

[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.740]
And it is 50 degrees currently

[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.540]
At 822

[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.840]
Great classic rock-and-roll

[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.820]
It doesn't have to be old

[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.140]
To be a classic

[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.040]
Peter Fooer

[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.120]
We're not talking field hockey

[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.700]
We're talking football here

[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.000]
This is it, the big one, Super Bowl 22

[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.440]
This Super Sunday's the Denver Broncos

[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.700]
Go up against the Washington Red Skins

[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.260]
Hello, this is Lee Gillette

[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.000]
Inviting you to watch the game with me

[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.440]
At the officials Zade afforded Super Bowl party

[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.780]
Hattening at Whistler

[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.340]
Now kickoff is in six

[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.400]
But we'll be cranking up the party around four

[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.100]
With Cours and Cours Life's Fesials

[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.480]
Plenty of chances to win dinners

[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.340]
That Whistler's those incredible Zade afford license plates

[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.240]
Cassettes and compact discs

[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.960]
A trip for two aboard the CSK

Now leaving Miami and Fort Lauderdale

[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.720]

So come on out, root for your favorite theme

[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.520]

Starting at 4PM this Sunday at Whistler's

[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.280]
Located at 20505 South Dixie Highway

[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.300]
At the Cutler Ridge Mall

[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.900]
The official Zade afforded Super Bowl party

[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.740]
From the station that gives you the most classic rock and roll

[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.940]
And football

[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:47.960]
Zade afforded Super Bowl party

[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.360]
Hey, look it's the four Mingles

[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.780]
Hey, got me four in a lottery ticket store

[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:56.240]
You can, all you got to do is walk this way

[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.420]
Walk this way for seven and eleven

[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.340]
Follow the Mingle walk this way

[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.480]
Your reason lies to read seven and eleven

[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.320]
Follow the Mingle walk this way

[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.020]
Now you can get your Florida lottery tickets fast and easy

[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.000]
There are two participating neighborhoods, seven and eleven

[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.400]
Where the good things come easy

[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.200]
24 hours a day

[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.080]
All you got to do is follow the flamingos

[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.800]
Walk this way for seven and eleven

[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.620]
Follow the Mingle walk this way

[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.640]
Oh oh oh oh oh

[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.500]
Seven and eleven

[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.300]
Night or day

[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.040]
Oh oh oh oh oh

[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.060]
Follow the flamingos

[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.100]
Who the flamingos sent you

[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.580]
Walk this way

[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.080]
824 on Zade of Florida

[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.540]
We have a major crisis evidently here

[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.820]
Is that little accident there?

[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.440]
Bad accident on Red Road west of Opalaka airport

[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.500]
Southbound from 159th to 138th

[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.840]
Also, Golden Glades Southbound

[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.100]
Extremely slow on 985

[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.800]
And an accident southbound on 95

[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.200]
Just south of Sunrise

[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.420]
It's backed up to Oakland Park Boulevard and northbound 95

[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.200]
Traffic around Davie Boulevard is backed up

[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.060]
Oh that's unusual

[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.960]
24 past eight see on Davie Boulevard

[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:13.840]
Either you hit the bridge

[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.180]
Or you hit the railroad tracks

[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.060]
Or if you're real lucky like I am both

[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.760]
Yeah so I just don't go on Davie Boulevard

[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.700]
Unless there just is nowhere else to get someplace

[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.720]
Anyway we have a major crisis here at the Zade of Florida

[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.820]
In fact we have a major crisis here

[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.600]
This is in the building

[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.440]
And it's called a case of terminal penny pinching

[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.020]
That's going on once again with Gaggan and Broadcasting

[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.600]
And as usual we take our case to the audience

[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.020]
Because when you do it inside here it's absolutely useless

[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.940]
Because they will they will penny

[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.840]
That fits somehow

[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.920]
Yeah those goose steppers in Portland

[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.500]
But they just don't want to pay

[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.920]
The freight, the freight, the freight

[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.620]
Do they? It is a freight

[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.680]
I'm serious they don't want to pay the freight

[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.960]
For this show or for any talent in this radio station they really don't

[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.780]
Well it seems to me they paid pretty well for a 1.2

[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.500]
Yeah but they won't pay

[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.580]
They were paying some people some untalented people some serious dollars

[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.960]
Who embarrassed and degraded and humiliated this radio station

[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.200]
And made it the laughing stock of the industry

[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.920]
And now that we're here doing about a five share in December and kicking ass

[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.360]
And number one in men 25 to 54

[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.700]
And with these humongous great demographics

[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.020]
They still don't want to pay anybody

[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:31.020]
And as far as stand majors concerned look at the way they jerked him around man just it's embarrassing

[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.300]
And like I said last spring when I had that nine share on the AM

[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.720]
I mean what is it that you have to accomplish before they come to you on an unbended knee

[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.820]
And say hey listen you really you really done it

[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.200]
And we're going to reward you finally reward you for it the way we should

[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.060]
And if we can't sell it we got incompetent sales people or we got 8 million other excuses

[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.420]
You don't worry about that because that's not your problem

[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.820]
You're doing your end of the bargain

[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:59.680]
See they won't do that they just won't do that because they just want to pinch and they just want to get something for nothing

[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.700]
And in life I've learned a long time ago it's very unusual you get something for nothing

[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.720]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.180]
It doesn't happen

[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.660]
So I don't know we'll see what happens

[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.580]
Do I have any I thought we may have a little leverage since that book came out

[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.820]
So you notice how it worked for me didn't you?

[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.320]
Nope, Nope NO NO

[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.260]
I'm going to look at this looking

[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:21.820]
Dzub b potatoes

[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:23.520]
Kal University

[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.100]
Neel headroom

[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.040]
We have these corporate meetings we got to go to and I can't justify that

[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.500]
And our salesmen all went through a mental institution to there

[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.280]
You know I just they got more excuses than Carter's got pillsìwe

[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.560]
It's gotta let's got to stop

[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.380]
I mean everybody in the world is listening to this show

[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.840]
In fact the only two commodities now don't want to insult so any of our colleagues

[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.100]
Because obviously we got some talented people in the building

[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.380]
But I'm talking about solid hard numbers.

[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.280]
Okay, we're talking.

[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.940]
Ass on the line is they say, okay, even the other morning as they say in Saudi Arabia,

[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.820]
Tuck us off and Tish, okay, we're putting it right on the line, all right?

[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.540]
And that's right, even the other morning shows are listening to this show because they're

[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:06.720]
just dazzled and they're trying to steal our material and basically stand major on the

[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.820]
AM in this show on the F, I'm where the numbers are.

[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.160]
Okay, and I realize that somebody over there on the AM, somebody's going to get bent

[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.420]
out of shape because they're going to say, well, look at 10 to 2 and he's still had,

[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.920]
yeah, he only lost like, what, half of the audience.

[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:18.940]
Yes, he did.

[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.580]
And then the younger demographics in December, I mean, there's like nothing left.

[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.040]
And like I said, I hate to keep saying that because he's a super guy and I love him to

[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.840]
pieces, but that's show man.

[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.400]
I mean, let's get serious, okay?

[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.280]
Let's get serial from 73,000 to 19,000 people in three months.

[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.460]
That's losing 70% of the audience.

[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.440]
So we know where the shows are and these two radio stations.

[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.600]
We know where the people are.

[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.300]
And they want to put up some bucks and pay for it.

[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.560]
And they're going to continue giving these damn excuses, excuses, right Gary?

[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.000]
Boy, getting a little testy here this morning.

[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.640]
Well, I didn't like that story.

[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.520]
You just told me that really it ticks me off.

[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.060]
It ticked me off.

[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:57.860]
They made a commitment to you and you made, you know, put your life on the line really

[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.380]
to get up at these unconscionable hours and give this thing a shot.

[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.920]
We've done incredibly well.

[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.860]
And nowhere along the line, by the way, have they ever, you know, they've always been, oh,

[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.520]
get him off.

[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.140]
He's, you know, he's killing your show.

[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:09.700]
He's terrible.

[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.020]
He's in any of these a bird brain.

[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.600]
We don't need any bird brain on there.

[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.800]
At no point do I believe unless I've missed something, have they ever said, well, we were

[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:22.780]
wrong, you know, and have they ever come to you and apologize and said, man, we, I guess

[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.000]
we were wrong as usual.

[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:24.400]
No.

[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.600]
And Neil was right.

[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.000]
How about that?

[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:27.480]
Yeah.

[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:31.720]
And isn't it amazing that all those people who came out on Saturday wanted to see all

[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.400]
three of us?

[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.100]
Yes, they did.

[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.720]
Once again, I trusted your instinct.

[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.900]
And it was again, correct.

[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.520]
I liked them.

[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.920]
We went against them.

[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.440]
So, yeah, because like I've said, when you're dealing with management in this business,

[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:45.620]
you listen to what they say.

[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.520]
You do 180 degrees, the opposite.

[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.580]
And you're going to, you're going to do a big number, man.

[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:50.800]
I'm telling you, because they're morons.

[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.980]
They haven't got any clue.

[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.280]
If you turn them loose and put them on the ear and let them try to do it, they'd all point.

[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.960]
So, okay, it would be in a minus column.

[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.460]
That's what you're dealing with in management in this business.

[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.860]
They're radio rejects.

[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.000]
29 past eight.

[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.040]
That's eight or four.

[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.140]
Well, it's true.

[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.200]
I know it's true.

[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:13.680]
It's true.

[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.160]
And this is the way I felt yesterday when I walked out of the building.

[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.220]
And they offer you like half a pound of hearts mountain, a month or something like that.

[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:20.840]
That was it.

[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:21.600]
That was it.

[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:21.920]
Yeah.

[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.640]
Like a little like an extra cuddle bone, once every three months, that's the raise for

[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.020]
the bird.

[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.960]
And for Captain Dave, it's a matter of fact, they gave him a monkey in a organ.

[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.720]
And they said, here, this is our contribution to your income.

[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:42.120]
Go out in the corner at 200 and go up by the Santa Rhea House and do a little organ grinder

[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:42.380]
there.

[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.440]
So, they have another meeting with me.

[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.180]
We'll see what happens.

[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.160]
I don't know if it'll be today or not, but we'll see what they see what they come up

[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:49.340]
with.

[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:49.940]
Yeah.

[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.560]
Well, you tell them for me that they suck.

[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.020]
Okay.

[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.280]
Oh, I already did that.

[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:53.560]
Yeah.

[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:54.280]
Tell them again.

[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:58.860]
Tell me that they suck too many broken promises, too much BS and not enough cash.

[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.160]
You know what?

[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.760]
And then they got all these stories about, wow, the reason this one is making so much

[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.020]
money.

[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:08.060]
And the reason I don't care about the reasons it just happens to be the facts of life,

[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:08.680]
you know what I'm saying?

[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.060]
I know.

[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:13.400]
The facts of life and they can't cope with that because they want to continue with that

[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.800]
in that fantasy land of nickel and diamond to death, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.740]
And we are going to sit still for it.

[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.540]
We're going to burn down the mission with Elton John on Zeta 4.

[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.060]
Here he is.

[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.140]
Okay.

[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:29.080]
It's 8.30 on his Tuesday morning, getting a little testy, a little excited because we

[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.900]
want, you know, this has become a very popular show and we performed a major, if you

[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:39.240]
pardon that expression, talking about Stamma, major major miracle.

[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.540]
Perform miracles on an AM.

[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.400]
Now we're immediately performing miracles.

[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.300]
And this was a station that needed something.

[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:51.140]
Remember, Mike in the mechanics, all I need is a gigantic miracle, right?

[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:51.580]
Okay.

[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.760]
And we did it.

[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.660]
And they still have a baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.440]
I, the salespeople are standing at the top of the world trade center in New York, the

[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.080]
threatening to jump.

[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.800]
And unless you back off and leave us alone, they're going to jump and just give us some

[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.940]
time, give us a year or two, give us five years.

[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.360]
And listen, friends, when we talk about the other top hosting this market, we don't want

[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.840]
to talk bad about them because we don't like to knock friends.

[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.000]
What the hell is that all about?

[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.720]
I like to put him on the morning.

[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:17.160]
Okay.

[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.980]
You see what kind of a number you get with him, all right?

[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.780]
With that sailor cap, my good buddy.

[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.160]
And I was driving by McDonald's.

[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.040]
You don't know about it, slight friends.

[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.360]
I didn't have a dollar in my pocket.

[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.380]
I had the kids in the car and the dogs on the roof.

[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.640]
And I was dying to know what to do.

[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.820]
And you don't know what's like not to be able to go to McDonald's and get a big Mac.

[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:36.880]
That's really desperate friends.

[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.400]
The dogs on the roof.

[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.720]
Oh, that's pitiful.

[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.760]
Yeah, they were up there with figure row and big day, if I guess.

[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.900]
I'm telling you one thing, big day.

[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.320]
If Craig Worthing ever meets you up on the roof, run for your life.

[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.440]
Or anyone else.

[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.880]
Well, a 32 on say to four, let's, well, just take some more calls.

[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:55.960]
I got it out of my system.

[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.760]
I'm sick and tired of these radio mung brains, these penny pinching douchebags.

[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.160]
These people got nothing but excuses.

[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.660]
Okay, turn loose the cash, baby.

[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.300]
And then when he said, well, there isn't any cash.

[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.180]
Is that our fault that they go to Chattahoochi and they bring sales people in from there?

[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.800]
He is a, now, seriously, we had a bus load from Arcadia yesterday come in here.

[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.200]
They were auditioning for sales jobs.

[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.140]
I couldn't believe it.

[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.820]
What the hell kind of a place is this?

[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.220]
Well, we're bringing some people in from New York.

[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.640]
I said, oh, really from WABC from, oh, no, from Bellevue.

[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.680]
I'm not, you know, seriously, get, get off of this already with these nuts,

[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.040]
those.

[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.880]
You know, it's just what we need is another couple of funeral partners on this show,

[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.120]
right?

[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.920]
Got all these 18 and 20 year old listeners out there and we're selling, you know,

[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.100]
colorectal tests.

[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.320]
Well, I like those.

[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.240]
Hey, kids, and you're sampling the mail.

[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.440]
How about those arthritis,

[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.180]
oh, yeah, let's have a few more of those arthritis linaments, okay?

[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.000]
Well, we ought to give them, you know, we ought to give them, you know, that little

[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.220]
dipper that goes into the bottle of the arthritis stuff.

[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.920]
I like to, I know where I'd like to put that.

[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.160]
Yeah.

[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.740]
That'll cure your arthritis right in here, man.

[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.240]
That'll loosen you up for Christmas.

[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.140]
Okay, let's take some more.

[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.440]
Let's go to Dave County.

[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.160]
Hello, Miami.

[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.500]
I, well, a little bit of it anyway.

[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.800]
Are you absolutely sure?

[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:19.340]
Yeah.

[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.460]
I'm in that space.

[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.100]
I'm sorry.

[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:23.900]
I apologize.

[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.800]
So I decided to call you.

[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:31.600]
I tune over to excuse me for doing this, but I had to get away from one of those screaming

[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.080]
remake car commercials.

[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:33.380]
Yeah.

[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.980]
I tuned over to love 94.

[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:36.900]
Oh, God.

[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:37.960]
Yes.

[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.680]
And remember you're playing at disco party record yesterday.

[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.140]
Yeah.

[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.740]
We're playing rock the boat by his purpose.

[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.060]
Oh, boy.

[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.860]
I wonder where they got the inspiration for that.

[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.300]
I have no idea.

[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.320]
Probably the same place where Dan Rather got the inspiration to use the word apoplectic.

[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.620]
I know if wasn't for me, man, the whole human race would, nobody would speak to each other anymore.

[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.920]
They'd have nothing left to say.

[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.480]
All you need to get a record, played in this market, played on this station.

[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.100]
You got it.

[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:05.560]
And a train.

[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.240]
I said before you get funny looks for laughing in his car.

[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:13.320]
You feel like you get on a bus with him to walk and do this show.

[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:13.840]
Yeah.

[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.860]
I can imagine, especially from the bus driver.

[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.080]
He's listening to TMI.

[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:19.900]
Yeah.

[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.140]
Well, anyway, I'm waiting for work and I gotta get going.

[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.320]
OK, have a great day.

[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:24.260]
Bye, boy.

[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.460]
834 and Zeta for Captain Dave.

[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.300]
I thought we were going to play a rock the boat again today, a little bit of it anyway.

[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:29.720]
Aren't we?

[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:30.820]
Where wasn't that the one?

[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.540]
I think you'd be right here in my hand.

[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.580]
OK, we got to play a spot here that I've kind of overlooked.

[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:42.100]
And referring to what she just said, you might want to say, hold on.

[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.640]
It will be right back after 60 seconds.

[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.760]
It might be a good idea.

[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.820]
And what if I don't want to say that?

[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.840]
What if I want to say Captain Dave screwed up?

[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.940]
So we have to go away for a minute, but we'll be right back.

[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.720]
Based on 24 month financing through Royal Dominic Financial Corporation with approved credit,

[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.360]
dealer participation may affect savings.

[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:10.660]
It's a record in the first days over 20,000 people have attended Toyota's Port surplus sale.

[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:17.220]
If we were unable to help you due to the crowds, please come back.

[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:23.200]
It goes all week at Port Everglades and Joe Robbie Stadium.

[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:30.080]
Any reasonable offer will be accepted and even some unreasonable ones.

[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:38.480]
World Omni Finance Reps cut your payments $50, $50 every month on every Toyota,

[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:43.380]
referring to Port Everglades on State Road 84 or Joe Robbie Stadium.

[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:48.860]
20,000 people have been to Toyota's Drastec Port surplus sale.

[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.400]
Your chance is to light till 9 p.m.

[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.040]
Well, I'm out of my mind, and he wants help in the town.

[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.320]
The only way to go, because the room that I've filed that's across my dial,

[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.400]
is not a line to me or I just show.

[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.020]
Now, Zeta 4 was no more.

[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.080]
I don't know where to go.

[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.400]
Now they're back with a better attack.

[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.460]
They feel like a me or I just show.

[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.800]
I just figured it out mathematically in my little nimble brain.

[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.060]
It comes out to like a bucket of quarter an hour that they want to give you for that big raise.

[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.720]
You can't even clean the cage for that.

[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:00.700]
You're right.

[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.640]
You know, these people out of their minds are what?

[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.020]
Do they think they're I mean, I realize that they've been exploiting a lot of us for years,

[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.360]
but how long do they think it's going to go on? Are they crazy?

[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.200]
You know, that figure is absolutely correct.

[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.540]
Yeah, bucket of quarter an hour.

[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.020]
That's right.

[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:12.960]
You're right.

[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.080]
I know.

[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.560]
You don't think that big time morning show, right?

[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.860]
Big major market, big time morning show.

[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.880]
And oh, yeah, congratulations.

[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.340]
You guys did a five in December.

[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.800]
Your kick and ask you just pull off a miracle.

[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:26.880]
Here you go.

[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.400]
Here's this.

[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.720]
We're going to give it to an increment.

[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.220]
You know, we'll give you 50 cents now.

[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.800]
And we'll give you a bus fare next hour.

[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.100]
Like to give them bus fare, okay?

[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.480]
The where to a big market like you know, windixi.

[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.240]
Not my windixi, by the way, stay out of there.

[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:41.940]
Yeah.

[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.100]
Boy, I just can't believe this.

[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:44.640]
I know.

[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:45.260]
I know.

[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.300]
I couldn't believe it.

[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.120]
But ring right along.

[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:47.860]
Oh, let's see.

[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.000]
Are we going to play a little bit of this?

[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:51.000]
Oh, boy.

[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.580]
And that's what we're doing this morning.

[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.280]
Isn't that appropriate?

[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.600]
They don't like that in this business.

[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.600]
You're never supposed to rock the boat.

[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.220]
So I'd like to know when you got the notion.

[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.720]
Said I'd like to know when you got the notion.

[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.000]
Rock the boat.

[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.000]
Don't rock the boat.

[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.200]
Baby, that rock the boat.

[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:10.760]
I told you.

[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:11.780]
Don't rock the boat.

[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:12.440]
Rock the boat.

[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.480]
I don't rock the boat.

[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:14.700]
Baby, that rock the boat.

[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:15.800]
Okay, that's enough of that.

[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:21.080]
Now, what are we supposed to play a little of a rock your baby by George McCray?

[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.340]
I mean, those two are like almost, they were out at the same time.

[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.100]
I like that.

[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:25.820]
They're like synonymous.

[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:26.500]
You like it better?

[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:26.900]
Mm-hmm.

[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.480]
Oh, yeah, I would agree with that.

[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:28.720]
Yeah.

[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:30.460]
I really like the sound of that.

[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:30.660]
Yeah.

[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:35.120]
In fact, one of my favorite records is machine gun by the Commodores, which was out at the same time.

[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:42.080]
Which I heard in a bar in Tampa and Renee's in 1973, and it was quite a moving experience.

[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:42.940]
Uh-huh.

[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.760]
But I don't know what that has to do with anything, unless perhaps KC is listening.

[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:48.940]
What can relate to that?

[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.200]
What were you drinking that night or eating?

[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.040]
And what were you wearing?

[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.240]
I don't remember what I was eating or wearing, but I remember what I first saw when I walked into that bar.

[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.420]
Like, it was yesterday.

[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.960]
For time when it wasn't going to conflict with that, but he just came running in here like a idiot.

[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:07.660]
I'm a steak, sorry.

[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.400]
A-26 on Zeta-4.

[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.020]
Speaking of idiots, here is Pulse.

[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.660]
I have no idea what this magazine is.

[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.040]
Do you?

[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:15.320]
No.

[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.640]
Wait till you hear this.

[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.800]
This is the January 19th issue for those who know what it is.

[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.280]
Yesterday.

[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.320]
Morning personality, Neorongers at Zeta-4 Miami is ill.

[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.620]
Some say it could be serious and lingering we hope rumors are not true.

[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.240]
What?

[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:35.980]
Meanwhile though, his absence allowed Joey Reynolds at WSHE to make some strong headway as the book started.

[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.020]
Reynolds with sidekick Bill Marshall never sounded better.

[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.400]
Have you ever heard such crap in your life?

[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:42.840]
Where did that come from?

[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.540]
What is this magazine?

[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.080]
It's one of the many.

[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.040]
The Pulse of Broad, oh it's another one of those broad chasing magazines.

[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.440]
Can you believe that?

[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.320]
When they never sounded better?

[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:53.580]
Well I got news for you.

[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.000]
If he never sounded better, that's a hell of a commentary on his career.

[00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:00.260]
Because if you listen to him lately, man, it's just like he's going through the motions.

[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.880]
They forgot to mention where his baggy pants anymore.

[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:03.420]
Really?

[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:03.960]
No.

[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.900]
They forgot to mention you were sick in between the rings.

[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:08.040]
Isn't that interesting?

[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.380]
Well there were no ratings being taken.

[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.180]
Could be serious and lingering.

[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.100]
Now Joey's problem is serious and lingering for about 30 years now,

[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:16.960]
but that's another story.

[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.140]
It's called no ratings.

[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.200]
It's like a wishful thinking.

[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.280]
A wishful thinking to me.

[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.080]
I can't believe this from Pulse.

[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:24.540]
Look at that out of here.

[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:25.760]
Talking about it.

[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.100]
It's only like a new in excess right.

[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:27.680]
What is it?

[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.100]
I can't remember the title, but it's really good.

[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:30.780]
I played it in the past.

[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:31.680]
Didn't I promise him stones?

[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.680]
I need you tonight.

[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.560]
You think that lead?

[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.960]
Well that's not getting to that.

[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.320]
No that's anything that lead you.

[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:36.620]
Let's see.

[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.060]
The only guy on his station, he can play stones.

[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:38.880]
No.

[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.720]
Or play stone.

[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:41.920]
Oh yeah.

[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.720]
The video is good as say you will by phone.

[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.620]
I saw that yesterday.

[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.140]
And my right is that's a black and white green.

[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:47.380]

[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:47.960]
And it's horrendous.

[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:48.220]
Yeah.

[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.900]
Makes no sense at all.

[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.240]
They got the ellipse and the glass.

[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.860]
As a matter of fact, you know who those lips might belong to?

[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:56.780]
Huh?

[00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:58.860]
643 on Zeta 4.

[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.480]
Yeah.

[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.360]
I can still find hand in my heart.

[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.480]
I'm a spell that I love when it's like you.

[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.000]
What is that as fine?

[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:12.560]
What is that as fine?

[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:12.920]
What is that as fine?

[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:13.280]

[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.240]
What is that as fine?

[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:34.240]

[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:34.240]

[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:34.240]

[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:34.240]

[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:34.240]

[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:34.520]
What is that as fine?

[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.720]
What is that as fine?

[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.060]
What is that as fine?

[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:38.380]
What is that as fine?

[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:39.220]
What is that as fine?

[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:39.840]
What is that as fine?

[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.500]
What is that as fine?

[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.200]
What is that as fine?

[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:51.800]
What is that as fine?

[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:52.180]
What is that as fine?

[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:52.400]
What is that as fine?

[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.860]
What is that as fine?

[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:55.160]
What is that as fine?

[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:56.320]
What is that as fine?

[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:00.960]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:01.720]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:02.760]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.440]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:03.940]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:04.520]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:05.180]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:05.540]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:06.840]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.280]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:07.460]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:07.520]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.360]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.120]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:09.800]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.020]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.400]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:14.400]

[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:14.400]

[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:14.440]
What is that as fine?

[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:14.980]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:16.220]
Scrum.

[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.280]
I shouldn't say that.

[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:17.720]
He's okay.

[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.760]
He's a great quarterback and a wonderful guy.

[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:20.860]
And he's got big lips.

[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.420]
It's a 12v4 7 on Zeta 4.

[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.640]
I'm just, I'm not into that like self-serving jump on the bandwagon.

[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.100]
Let's raw raw for the sting.

[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.880]
And the, uh, hurray, did I say the sting?

[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:32.800]
Yeah.

[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.020]
What is the name of the team again?

[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:36.480]
What team?

[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:37.560]
The basketball team.

[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.080]
All the heat.

[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:38.640]
Oh, the heat.

[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.060]
Now, what did I say the sting?

[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.320]
Well, it must be the concert coming up.

[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:47.260]
Anyway, uh, or whatever it is, the hurricanes, all this other stuff, the shill stuff, you know?

[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:47.660]
Yeah.

[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.660]
It's one thing to be an athletic supporter, but let's get serious.

[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:51.860]
That is a good name though.

[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.060]
Yeah, the sting.

[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.160]
That is a good name.

[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:55.780]
Yeah, we better call the police.

[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.360]
That's a better name.

[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.740]
Okay, should we take a call before the news?

[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.260]
Couple of lines open and date.

[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:05.520]
And of course, as soon as I said that we're going to play a five minute cut, almost everybody disappeared.

[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:06.760]
You know, that's the way you people are.

[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.100]
You have no sting power anymore.

[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.200]
Remember back in the early days of the show, I guess the novelty is worn off.

[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:11.720]
Is that what it is?

[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.760]
How loyal it used to be are loyal, Zedolus.

[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.080]
They would hang on forever to get to talk to us.

[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.200]
Now it's like, it's playing a record.

[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:20.760]
Scrum.

[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:22.460]
That's like that kind of stuff.

[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:22.780]
Yeah.

[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.620]
Should we take one from Broward County?

[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:26.040]
Sure.

[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:26.520]
Hello.

[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:27.320]
Hello, Neil.

[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:27.760]
Hi.

[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:33.140]
I've been trying to get a hold of you since you first came on the air in October on the FM.

[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:33.760]
Mm-hmm.

[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.040]
You used to call you on the AM.

[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:35.560]
Really?

[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:39.360]
With the ones from Rochester, New York and Canada, a daily area we used to call you.

[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:39.880]
Mm-hmm.

[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.800]
Let me tell you something that happened.

[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:43.980]
We went to...

[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.560]
I loved the reverb on the car.

[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.360]
You went to Rochester.

[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.200]
Yeah, that was a big mistake.

[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:48.880]
That's right.

[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:55.040]
And we ordered some white huts and we had to mail to you direct from airfare, you know, air freight.

[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.580]
Yeah, what happened to them?

[00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.900]
They refused when we sent them there.

[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.360]
Why is that?

[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:02.420]
I have no idea.

[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.540]
They said customer refused and we mailed them to the station.

[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:06.420]
Customer refused?

[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:07.240]
Yeah.

[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.260]
Oh, I can't.

[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:08.520]
They're not here.

[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.020]
They weren't.

[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:09.940]
Not by me.

[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.440]
How maybe not by you, but they were refused because that's what it said on the box.

[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:14.260]
Oh, that's great.

[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:14.860]
Isn't it?

[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.840]
It was returned to us.

[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:16.700]
Oh, my God.

[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.260]
Well, listen, I thank you anyway for the sentiment.

[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.260]
And I wonder who the idiot was here that did that.

[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.060]
Well, I don't know, but there was an idiot there that did.

[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:22.780]
And then we weren't...

[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:23.780]
Well, there were a lot of idiots here.

[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:28.920]
And then we weren't able to get a hold of you anymore because you had gone into the FM.

[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.820]
And every time we tried to call you, the line was busy.

[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.760]
But anyway, that's what happened.

[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.520]
And it was refused by somebody over there.

[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.060]
And I just want you to know that we did do it for you.

[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.620]
Well, I appreciate the sentiment was there and that's what counts.

[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:44.040]
But anyway, let me take something else.

[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:44.340]
Yes.

[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:49.080]
If somebody driving around in plantation with a driver's license, I mean, you know, one of those

[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:52.700]
license plates from the front, it's a Zeta 94, Neil Rogers.

[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.240]
Wow.

[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.340]
Where did the hell they get that?

[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.040]
I have no idea, but I saw it in plantation.

[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.900]
It says Neil Rogers on it.

[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.300]
Yup.

[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.100]
It says Zeta 94 in the corner.

[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.120]
Then it had Neil Rogers in the other corner.

[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:05.540]
Hmm.

[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.760]
But you don't know where they're getting them?

[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.460]
I have no idea.

[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.580]
We don't have them.

[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:10.720]
They must have had that done themselves.

[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.640]
Well, must be, but there's...

[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.180]
There's a couple of them in the Broward Mall.

[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.340]
A couple of them?

[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.440]
Yeah, they were in the front of the...

[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:18.980]
You know, in front of their cars.

[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:22.640]
Well, somehow I feel pretty stupid, you know, because I know nothing about that.

[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:23.900]
Yeah, well, they're there.

[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.440]
I'm sure that our promotion department knows nothing about it either because they're real stupid.

[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.540]
Well, they're around, trust me.

[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.920]
Okay, listen, have a great day.

[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:31.260]
Good to.

[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.440]
And thanks again for the sentiment.

[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.780]
I'm sorry that they didn't get here, but I didn't get a hold of them, but, you know...

[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.440]
Well, okay.

[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.040]
Thanks.

[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:37.400]
Bye-bye.

[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:38.160]
Another shame?

[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:38.960]
Yeah, it's an idiot.

[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.920]
It's some Jackass sent my White Hots away.

[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.640]
My sentiment's exactly.

[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.180]
Robin Williams, new movie.

[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:49.760]
Good morning, Vietnam is number one at the box office.

[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.820]
It was the top draw earning almost $12 million in its first weekend.

[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.740]
Next on the list was last week's leader, three men and a baby,

[00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.580]
with $8 million in ticket sales.

[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:04.300]
And the third place shares brand new release moon struck with five million dollars.

[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:09.400]
And by the way, the next film on the list is called Return of the Living Dead Part 2.

[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:10.440]
Oh, I can't wait for that.

[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:11.960]
That's about hell in there.

[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.820]
Yeah, it is, as a matter of fact.

[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.100]
A story for Stan Major now.

[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:23.060]
Couch Potatoes will rise up from their sofas this weekend at the Hyatt in Lincolnwood, Illinois.

[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.400]
That'll be Saturday and Sunday.

[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.180]
The Couch Potato Weekend, it's called.

[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:33.540]
And that will include a discussion of TV therapy and also potato Olympics.

[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.640]
And I have a feeling there's not much to those, I don't know.

[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:38.880]
Anyway, I have an 800 number.

[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.360]
If you want more information, it's funny.

[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:41.500]
I'm betting on the skins, myself.

[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.500]
1-800-228-9000.

[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.840]
I'm going to get you more information on that.

[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.120]
Get it? Potato skins?

[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.340]
I got it.

[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:50.460]
No, I got it.

[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.080]
I just wanted to make sure.

[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:52.960]
No, no worries.

[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.300]
It's really slow on spines.

[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.000]
I know, I know.

[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.100]
You can order LA law when the pilot.

[00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:58.280]
Okay.

[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:02.060]
The pilot for the NBC series will be.

[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:02.760]
He's freaking me out.

[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:08.160]
Again, it'll be in the pilot will be in video stores in March.

[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:18.860]
It's a 97 minute cassette and it features the episode that won the show three Emmys, including one for Best Guest Star, who was Alfred Woodard, one for Best Directing and one for Best Art Direction.

[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.780]
Partly cloudy today with a high of 82.

[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:24.940]
Loaded at 70.

[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:29.100]
And at 70 degrees at Zeta 4 at 653.

[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.940]
Classic walking rules since 1974.

[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.920]
It doesn't have to be old to be in classic.

[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.240]
So, four.

[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:41.040]
It's the Neil Roger show on Zeta 4.

[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.200]
656 on a Tuesday morning here on Zeta 4.

[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:46.100]
Four delicious, incredible Mexican food served fast.

[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:50.440]
Without the fast food taste, you have to try Fiesta tacos in Kendall.

[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.040]
The not your average fly by Naitako stand.

[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.980]
Fiesta tacos has been a business for 10 years.

[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.220]
I'm getting choked up just thinking about it.

[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:00.460]
And everything they serve is cooked from scratch.

[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:04.360]
It's not incredible.

[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:04.820]
Look at that.

[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.240]
I just looked at Captain Dave when I said that and he just totally panicked.

[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:10.960]
Everything they serve is cooked from scratch with only the freshest homemade ingredients.

[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:14.280]
And believe me, you're going to taste the difference at Fiesta tacos.

[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.340]
Tonight is taco night.

[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.380]
That means from four o'clock this afternoon until closing.

[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:22.240]
You can get your choice of three beef, bean or combination tacos for only two bucks in 19 cents.

[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.120]
It's a great deal.

[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.020]
It happens every Monday and Wednesday night.

[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.540]
Wait a minute.

[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:28.980]
Just a minute.

[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:29.880]
It says it's a great deal.

[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:30.960]
It happens every Monday and Wednesday.

[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.840]
United Fiesta tacos is today Wednesday.

[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.600]
Have you become like a tongue tied or something in there now?

[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:39.580]
What is your story?

[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:40.960]
I'm talking on the phone.

[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.420]
Oh, you're talking on the phone?

[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:42.900]
Yeah.

[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.120]
Well, you know, one of my duties is to answer the phone.

[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:45.500]
Oh, I see.

[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.160]
Well, excuse me.

[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:46.420]
Okay.

[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.100]
Now, I was a little confused because let me say it again.

[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.120]
It says tonight is taco night at Fiesta tacos.

[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:50.900]
Mmm.

[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:52.640]
And it says it's a great deal.

[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.300]
And it happens every Monday and Wednesday night.

[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.020]
And?

[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.640]
Well, tonight's not Wednesday.

[00:43:59.440 --> 00:43:59.760]
Oh.

[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.420]
Today is my screwing up here.

[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.460]
Like I thought yesterday was sure was not Monday.

[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.000]
Is somebody playing a trick on me?

[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:06.960]
Is this really not Tuesday?

[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.400]
Well, somebody call and tell us what day it is.

[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.400]
Well, anyway, if you're into burritos, you've come to the right place because

[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.160]
Fiesta tacos.

[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.240]
This is sure you'll volunteer when she comes in here.

[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:16.400]
I'm going to ring her neck like a chicken.

[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:16.720]
Okay.

[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:20.200]
By the way, speaking of chickens, the Santa Ria House must be doing okay.

[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.880]
Do you see the big white El Dorado sitting in the garage there?

[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:23.180]
No.

[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:23.540]
No.

[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:24.120]
Brand new one.

[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:24.320]
Yeah.

[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.140]
I like it.

[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.400]
So in the on light behind Mary's head business must be doing real good there.

[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:28.600]
Yeah.

[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:29.640]
Well, it's a little halo.

[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.980]
Anyway, if you're into burritos, you've come to the right place.

[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:36.320]
Fiesta tacos serves up the biggest burritos you've ever seen.

[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:39.800]
I mean, a burrito so big that even Jeff Stryker would be envious.

[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:40.880]
You're with your choice.

[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.140]
I felt like beef chicken, bean and combination burritos.

[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:47.960]
And you've got to try those potato skins, which were speaking of oldie moments ago, jam pecked

[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.940]
with great combinations like beef and cheese, chili and cheese, chicken and cheese, and traditional

[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.220]
sour cream and onions.

[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:56.960]
Fiesta tacos is open seven days a week for lunch and dinner Sunday through Thursday

[00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.820]
till 10 Friday and Saturday until 11 for the very best in Mexican food.

[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.680]
It's Fiesta tacos.

[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:06.900]
They're at 139 21 North Kindle Drive in the Kindle Lakes Mall in prestigious Kendall.
