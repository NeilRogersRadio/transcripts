[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460]
Turn it off because they want to see if we're going to make it.

[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.720]
If I'm going to make it, they're going to carry me out of here.

[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.620]
You know what I think we'll do?

[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.840]
You know how like Don Cox used to do all that contrived stuff?

[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.380]
Try to get publicity.

[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.080]
Yeah.

[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.500]
Really helped them a lot, didn't it?

[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.300]
He used to.

[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.740]
Yeah.

[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.460]
Well, he's been known to do it every now and then since then too.

[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.480]
I think what we'll do is just maybe we can find another card of this somewhere.

[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.100]
That's what she said.

[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.220]
She said there were like bird droppings over her shoulders.

[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.860]
Okay, here's the Barbie report for the bird on date County Line 2.

[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.160]
Hello.

[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.940]
It's still getting the fingerprint transfer from the other night.

[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.620]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.220]
Look into this.

[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.340]
This is another one of our guests the other night.

[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.560]
Boy, it made one of his cameo appearances.

[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.940]
How come my screen just went out Captain Dave?

[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.200]
Well, what an effect you had on my screen.

[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.680]
Why is it time delay?

[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.400]
Oh, cut it out.

[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.900]
Would you please?

[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.520]
It's joking.

[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.480]
I want to find out.

[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.620]
Oakland, we and Barbie and I divorced and I can give you the phone number now.

[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.020]
Oh, the Barbie report about that young lady.

[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.260]
Now you said she had a big ass.

[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.920]
Oh, I don't remember.

[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.940]
Dave said yes.

[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.360]
I remember.

[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.700]
Yes.

[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.420]
Oh, she does have.

[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.320]
I like that.

[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.880]
I hope she's listening too.

[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.120]
Yeah.

[00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.640]
I thought she was cute.

[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.560]
She was incredible.

[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.980]
Yeah.

[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.040]
I thought she was very cute.

[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.740]
I want to act up.

[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.300]
She was fine.

[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.140]
Yeah.

[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.140]
Well, she isn't even my type and she just she was fantastic.

[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.140]
I can't believe that's Barbie.

[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.760]
Now she's too crazy for Glen.

[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.200]
She's too crazy.

[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.640]
She's totally out of it.

[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.940]
Yeah.

[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.240]
And if she was hanging around with you guys, you one has to really wonder what that's all

[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.500]
about.

[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.660]
I thought she says something lacking there like calcium or something in the brain.

[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.120]
Yeah.

[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.800]
Absolutely.

[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.420]
Something lacking.

[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.200]
And well, she wants to she wants to be Glen's bear his first child.

[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.580]
No problem.

[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.320]
Yeah.

[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.000]
I have to give you the first one.

[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.420]
No, I beg to differ with that.

[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.740]
There has to, you know, in order to do that, there's certain equipment necessary.

[00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.780]
Trust me.

[00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.600]
I don't know.

[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.340]
Well, that's half of the battle.

[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.020]
I need to give Glen the phone number off the radio.

[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.720]
Yeah.

[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.780]
Call me after 10.

[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.360]
I don't.

[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.500]
I can't call you after 10.

[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.720]
Why?

[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.700]
Because.

[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.320]
Well, put him on hold and Captain Dave will take the number.

[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.560]
Yeah.

[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.440]
I'll take the number.

[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.960]
I'll wait a minute.

[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.380]
Wait a minute.

[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.400]
Wait a minute.

[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.760]
Another one.

[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.120]
Would you really taking this number?

[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.800]
Yeah.

[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.480]
Well, I used to have it.

[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.280]
Barbie and I go way back.

[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.040]
I used to have it too, but lately it's.

[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.740]
Now Barbie and I go way back.

[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.860]
Oh, stop it.

[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.380]
Would you please?

[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.920]
Oh, you just.

[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.780]
Does it kneel?

[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.440]
Do you want the number?

[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.840]
No, I don't want the number.

[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.520]
Although the way things are going lately, you know, I made a.

[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.240]
Well, I know one person that's interested.

[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.160]
In what?

[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.520]
Well, and moving in.

[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.240]
Oh.

[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.320]
They were kicked out of the apartment the other day.

[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.440]
One of the rhythm 98 DJs stand the man who would love to move in with the ball.

[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.160]
Stand the bear.

[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.280]
Okay.

[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.560]
Well, I'm not running a boarding house.

[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.000]
Okay.

[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.680]
In fact, at this moment, I have one border that I'm trying to move out.

[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.240]
Oh, but this border will put out.

[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.900]
Nothing.

[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.060]
No, we're not interested.

[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.340]
This is not the brothel of the year.

[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.620]
Okay.

[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.960]
Like us is back in Phoenix.

[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.460]
Okay.

[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.500]
Okay.

[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.220]
Let me put you on hold before you just totally destroy your credibility with little is left.

[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.520]
All right?

[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.100]
What a call.

[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.620]
Okay.

[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.780]
That's on two.

[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.000]
You get a lot of sleazy calls to that.

[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.720]
That's fruit cake.

[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.240]
Yeah.

[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.640]
That's the fruit cake.

[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.840]
Yeah.

[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.020]
Yeah.

[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.600]
See on FM, we welcome him on AM.

[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.620]
We used to pretend that we discouraged him.

[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.260]
Oh, I didn't know that.

[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.060]
I didn't get the memo.

[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.080]
I don't know if he's okay.

[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.400]
I didn't get a memo about the change.

[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.020]
Or are you not allowed to speak to him anymore?

[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.860]
I thought I'd just hear him speaking to him.

[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.040]
Now, the word from Gary Lawrence was the next time he speaks to him on the phone, he's

[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.200]
out.

[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.040]
No, no, it's okay if it's on the year.

[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.820]
No, he never said that.

[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.880]
He didn't?

[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.140]
No.

[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.520]
I was in there when he said it.

[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.460]
And Mark Cune said that, you know, you don't work for him anymore, but Peter Boulder

[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.660]
would certainly back us up.

[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.220]
Didn't you just hear him talking to fruit cake?

[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.040]
Like you were.

[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.880]
Sort of like you.

[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.260]
Yeah, but I don't have any altamatos.

[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.780]
Okay.

[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.060]
In other words, I can talk to him over there.

[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.860]
I want it's my show.

[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.580]
No, no, no, no.

[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.120]
See, you missed the point here.

[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.060]
What they did not want me to do was talking to him, you know, like privately.

[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.240]
But on the air, they hear the entire conversation.

[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.520]
You didn't want you to yintho with him?

[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.140]
That's correct.

[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.380]
And on the air, they hear the entire conversation and realize it was really nothing, you know,

[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.900]
no information.

[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.140]
Yeah, that's what they realized.

[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.820]
They realized there was nothing very, very well put.

[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.760]
So that's okay.

[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.300]
I agree.

[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.820]
All right.

[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.520]
Robert County.

[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.840]
Hello.

[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.860]
Hi, Neil.

[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.680]
This is Barbara.

[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.520]
Hi, Barbara.

[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.800]
I want to tell you how much I enjoy the show.

[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.460]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.420]
Barbara, you know, I was supposed to talk to Patty from New York is in Humana Hospital and

[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.180]
I was going to call her between 8 and 8.30.

[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.120]
We got all carried away and we give away those tickets.

[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.300]
And I forgot.

[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.840]
But I want to wish I'm sure Patty from New York hopefully is listening and we wish you're

[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.200]
a speedy recovery and all the best and I'm sorry.

[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.180]
And I need to.

[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.680]
Okay.

[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.360]
And I want to be sure I got to work, put my vote in today.

[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.100]
All right.

[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.880]
Here's a good caller.

[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.780]
Now what's your scam?

[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.520]
So we are taking a vote, right?

[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.560]
Well, evidently.

[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.340]
It's Mark's mom.

[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.380]
Oh, it's Barbara.

[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.400]
See?

[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.280]
Yeah, another incestuous caller.

[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.540]
And none of mine have been incestuous.

[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.580]
It's right where you say.

[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.560]
Yeah, I must go because I'm going to have a hard attack.

[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.360]
My heart is really pounding.

[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.200]
I'll bet.

[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.020]
What kind of attack?

[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.280]
Have a wonderful day.

[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.020]
You too.

[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.620]
Okay.

[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.200]
There they go.

[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.720]
You too.

[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.380]
I love that.

[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.020]
He said don't pester her too much.

[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.240]
In other words, pester her a little bit but don't over do it.

[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.900]
Like you were in the restaurant the other night just enough to keep her on the edge of insanity.

[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.260]
26 till 10 on Zeta 4 and God's will be along at 10 o'clock with those insipid drop ins.

[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.320]
And you know, I'm giving up.

[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.060]
I'm not going to give him any more advice because we gave him sound advice as my friend Rick

[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.400]
would say over on university drive.

[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.340]
We gave sound advice.

[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.940]
Absolutely.

[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.020]
And, you know, that was it.

[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.920]
There he is right now on cue.

[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.980]
I'm telling you, you can listen to all those yet to start there.

[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.640]
It sucks.

[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.980]
Just wait till 10.

[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.380]
You'll see.

[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.220]
Maybe the same thing.

[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.340]
Get out of here.

[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.940]
Will you please.

[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.120]
We're not listening at 10.

[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.480]
We're going to be listening to midday melodies on hot 105.

[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.200]
You're going to be listening to your friend Patty Murray.

[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.940]
That automated.

[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.300]
Yeah, my she's a bitch.

[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.480]
Stop.
