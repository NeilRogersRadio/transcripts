[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]
Through we have just a pile of stuff, okay?

[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:11.660]
We had all the train up real pile of stuff, but anyway great for WIOD tremendous and we can't take any credit for it because we were here one week out of all of this

[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.680]
So it's not gonna mean anything for us and like I said, we're kind of in limbo so we can be real objective

[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.180]
Now who is number one in the market?

[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.720]
What is this boy? I don't understand this at all. I don't

[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.160]
Um

[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.420]
Boy this doesn't make any sense to me at all this one page here. Well anyway, let's get down to a vanity gritty

[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.780]
Okay, six to ten a.m

[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.020]
Monday through Friday life of course

[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.560]
Lifeless WLYF slush elevator music for the walking dead

[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.860]
They had a seven one they were number one like they always are

[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.060]
They're more brain dead people here than anything else

[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.120]
Mike Rinerie with a six one a big number was number two in the entire market in the morning

[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.500]
So he was really number one because nobody counts life an excellent job from Mike

[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.500]
Yeah, wacky, which is esponiala five nine so they don't count QBA five nine

[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.480]
There's two more that don't count but I say they don't count they count to somebody

[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.800]
But not in the realm that we live in okay, and those of you out there don't care about ratings

[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.860]
They're not interested in the numbers. They don't understand them buzz off. Okay, because we care about it

[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.800]
And all the people in the business are listening why 100 that a four five in the morning that's sunny five going on

[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.660]
Uh-huh, and we're waiting for by the way got my five hundred dollar check for Camilla's house right here

[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.660]
Here it is and sunny we expect you to be here any uh any moment any day and dropping it off at the front desk Zeta

[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.800]
Dropping now we were gone from there for two weeks, okay? They dropped our last trend was a five five to a four one

[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.280]
Oh in one month

[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.700]
Ah, and we were only gone two weeks, okay to a four one which is the lowest the morning show has had in many many months now

[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.660]
Of course somebody over there rose would say oh yeah, but the kernel was not yeah

[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.020]
Good luck that in 40 cents will buy you a watery cup of coffee at Wolfies on 21st and Collins, okay

[00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.800]
Magic dropped to a three eight, this is um 12 plus 6 to 10 a.m.

[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.960]
Then power with a three I'm not gonna go through the holist a winds drop from a four over to a three six in the morning 12 plus

[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.180]
W Y and Z

[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.620]
Okay, where is it?

[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.140]
I know I'm off mic, but just relax.

[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.540]
Okay.

[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.940]
Kick and ask with 50,000 watts of power all over South Florida from the keys to the Palm

[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.860]
beaches, even out to the Bahamas.

[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.920]
This is WIN.

[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.440]
Yeah, well, you only wish.

[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.360]
Anyway, so they took a dive and then WS News took a big dive in the morning.

[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.020]
They dropped from a 4-3 to a 3-6 in the morning.

[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.400]
You see, they had a month in the summer.

[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.100]
I forget which one it was.

[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.260]
WS News remember the whole station that was this guy.

[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.940]
Yeah, he had it.

[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.940]
Distorted thing.

[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.080]
And stations do get distorted.

[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.340]
Months like GTR got a bad distortion, too trend before this one.

[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.360]
And they're still recovering from that.

[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.940]
Gloves in the morning from a 3-1 to a 3-3.

[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.140]
Okay.

[00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.260]
Hot from a 1-9 to a 3.

[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.420]
Hot was one of the big stories.

[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.160]
GTR from a 2-6 back up to a 2-9.

[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.760]
Like I said, last month really devastated them with some bad sampling by Arbitron.

[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.180]
Exactly.

[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.280]
Thank you so much.

[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.700]
Anyway, let's see, midday from 10 to 3.

[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.760]
And again, we were here only a very brief time.

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.860]
Life with a 9-8.

[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.220]
Magic with a 5-6, which is a big drop for them, but still second.

[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.900]
Gloves from a 3-5 up to a 4-4.

[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.860]
WS News from a 5-1 down to a 4-2.

[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.580]
Sandy.

[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.700]
Enjoy QBA power.

[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.980]
CMQ, WIOD.

[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.800]
Now, isn't this interesting?

[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.440]
WIOD from a 3-1 to a 3-7.

[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.940]
Huh.

[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.920]
Now, we were only here a week.

[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.640]
Is it possible that in a week we had that kind of impact here?

[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.020]
I don't know.

[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.260]
Would be interesting because in the next one we'll find out.

[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.140]
3-1 to a 3-7, which is the biggest number in midday this day.

[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.480]
And has had in a very long time.

[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.460]
Isn't that fascinating?

[00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.040]
Isn't it?

[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.500]
He said.

[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.460]
And let's see if there's anybody else of interest here.

[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.880]
Not nothing too exciting in midday.

[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.500]
How about wins?

[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.840]
I don't, the reason I forgot about them is I don't come across them on the low.

[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.240]
They come low on the, they're feeling mighty low.

[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.980]
You go way down.

[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.780]
Let's see, Waxi, oh wins.

[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.240]
Stayed flat at a 2-4 in midday.

[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.660]
There were 19 in the market.

[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.400]
Okay, after a big dive in the morning.

[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.240]
This is 12 plus, don't forget.

[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.540]
We'll get to those demos momentarily, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.680]
And those who are bored by this, tough potatoes.

[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.240]
Afternoon drive.

[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.280]
And how Steve will be interested in this 12 plus life with a 7-7.

[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.340]
You just can't beat them.

[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.680]
You might as well knock their antenna down or something.

[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.500]
Power had a 5-5, Y-100-4-8.

[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.700]
And that was one of the big stories according to Spike is that power beat Y-100 in this book,

[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.200]
which is no, not power.

[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.980]
I mean hot.

[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.540]
I can't say.

[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.760]
The overall.

[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.800]
I haven't, that's the first thing there.

[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.820]
It didn't make any sense to me.

[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.700]
Magic of 4-7.

[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.560]
W-snoos from a 4-9 to a 4-3.

[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.780]
And afternoon, that's Alice.

[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.160]
Steve from a 4-6 to a 4-1.

[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.600]
However, again, keep in mind that's 12 plus.

[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.680]
So those 65-year-plus listeners are still doing it for W-snoos, but they're dropping like a rocket ship.

[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.100]
Gloves from a 3-1 to a 3-9.

[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.900]
Gloves had that pretty good book here, looks like.

[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.560]
Winds from a 2-4 down to a 2-3.

[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.040]
Yeah, pretty good trend.

[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.780]
Excuse me.

[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.500]
Boy, I say you wonder why he's here, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.300]
He's here to correct me on every mistake that I make and they will not let a single one go.

[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.080]
This is important.

[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.600]

[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.960]
Night, EDR 7-6, power with a 6-9, hot with a 6-1.

[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.580]
Ooh, life with a 6.

[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.900]
W-snoos a 5-2, a little slippage there for a year.

[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.780]
QBA, Y-100 with a 4-1, Waxi with a 4-1, winds from it with a 4.

[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.200]
They went back up at night with that horrendous talknet.

[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.800]
On the weekends, of course, the dolphins help out over here.

[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.100]
So we did very well at IOD.

[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:56.600]
The life had a 7-8, power 6-1, IOD a 5-2, an EDR hot CMQ, QBA, TMIW, just snooze down to a 3-4 on the weekend.

[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.860]
Must be some of the right wingers are dying off.

[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.520]
Winds down to a 2-3 on the weekend.

[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.620]
Okay, now we're getting to some of those demographics, okay?

[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.360]
And I know some of you are just getting bored to tears by this.

[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.200]
You're ready to pass out on the floor, so we'll take a break, okay?

[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.800]
Isn't that a good excuse, man?

[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.740]
Are we sneaking to this crap and unbelievable on this show?

[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.060]
Even to me, it's unbelievable.

[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.780]
Unbelievable.

[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.920]
Unbelievable to steal a phrase from Rose Folger, okay?

[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.780]
They dropped overall, by the way, at Zeta from a 2-5 to a 2-0, and of course the big dip there is we had told you.

[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.660]
Oh, we didn't find them yet in the other day part.

[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.580]
They're way down.

[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.160]
That's why I didn't come across them.

[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.040]
We'll go back, because I want to save her every second of it.

[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.200]
They dropped from a 2-5 to a 2 and one trend.

[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.460]
We want to get every day part.

[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.840]
But they've turned the corner now, man.

[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.080]
They've turned the corner.

[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.380]
They've corrected the problem.

[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.220]
They're going to be consistent.

[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.680]
Yeah.

[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:47.060]
Anyway, I want to tell you about Nutra System today is weighing the 1024WYOD, and as we look back,

[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.520]
as we look back over some of those Zeta numbers that we missed earlier,

[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.500]
unbelievable.

[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.020]
You want to see some people do a little kazaki on the tabletop here at night.

[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.100]
This is the first...

[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.660]
See, I got all the stuff out of order here.

[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.160]
It's not spike spot.

[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.180]
He's just under a lot of pressure.

[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:09.760]
Anyway, Monday through Sunday, the whole week, 12-plus, WYOD had a 4-6 to rank third in the whole market

[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.460]
between life and power.

[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.640]
We had a 4-6, which is a giant number.

[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.240]
WSNEW dropped from a 4-7 to a 4-0, and INZ had a 2-8.

[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.260]
So, of the three competitors, IOD kicked some serious, serious ass.

[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.760]
Now, getting back to those day parts, boys and girls,

[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.560]
well, let's go 3-7 PM, 12-plus.

[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.660]
Let's find Zeta in there.

[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.660]
Okay, so we don't have to be.

[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.400]
They dropped from a 1-6 to a 1-4, which is marginal.

[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.560]
1-10 AM to 3 PM.

[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.400]
In midday, we already told you the big drop over there in the morning.

[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.400]
In midday, they dropped...

[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.180]
Well, no, I don't know if they dropped.

[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.260]
You know, Gonser, he doesn't have much to drop.

[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.120]
2-4 to a 2...

[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.160]
Oh, that's INZ.

[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.220]
I knew that couldn't be right.

[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.920]
They don't seem to have seen a 2 in a long time.

[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.540]
1-6 to a 1-4, Gonser, giving just a little bit there.

[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.600]
You know, Jeff, he's a great guy, but Gonsal might eat that show.

[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.760]
And now, what did I do?

[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.120]
Oh, here's the real winner now.

[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.280]
Wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.520]
Okay, here it is.

[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.260]
7-am at night, WZTA.

[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.200]
We should have a drum roll.

[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:16.600]
We got to get...

[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.420]
We got all kinds of sound effects.

[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:18.940]
And there, wait a minute.

[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.280]
Roger's got something big here.

[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:20.600]
Okay.

[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.100]
He's got the appropriate sound effect.

[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.420]
When you hear this number, man, you're going to go apoplectic.

[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.700]
You're going to go, hey, here it is.

[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.560]
Hey, excellent.

[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.880]
Thank you, Roger.

[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.080]
This deserves a 45-minute drum roll.

[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.800]
7-am at night, 12-plus WZTA, a 0.7.

[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:39.300]
Ah.

[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.240]
Ranking number 27 out of 29 rated stations.

[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.340]
And look at Roger.

[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.080]
A 0.7.

[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.760]
Oh, dropping from a 1-1, which wasn't much to write home.

[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.220]
So they dropped in every day part.

[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.300]
They dropped.

[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.580]
And I wonder about on the weekend.

[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.860]
You think they did well on the weekend?

[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.360]
Because that used to be their strong point that Rose used to talk about.

[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.280]
See, now that we've gone, man, they've turned that corner, baby.

[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.160]
Corrected the problem.

[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.800]
They've corrected all their problems because we couldn't turn over that audience for them.

[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.500]
They got it down.

[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.440]
Let's take a look here.

[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.660]
Let's see how they did on the weekend.

[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.200]
Because they used to be 2-1-1-6 on the weekend.

[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:13.660]
Okay.

[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.540]
So I guess the fact that we've left just hasn't to sunk in yet with the rest of that audience, man.

[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:25.280]
Now, 25 to 54 in the morning, 6 to 10 AM, Zeta.

[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:26.420]
Wow.

[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.600]
Our last to trend there, we had a 7-1, the last two trend.

[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.340]
5-0.

[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.760]
They lost 2.1 points in two weeks, keeping mine.

[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:42.740]
And dropping like a rocket, like a giant brick from the Empire State Building, like a penny

[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.160]
from the World Trade Center.

[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.300]
Rocketing is a matter of fact, listen to this.

[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.900]
A reneary in the morning tied them with a 5 that's his biggest share ever in 25 to 54

[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.440]
in the morning, at least anywhere on here.

[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.340]
That's a big number, man, on an AM station in the morning.

[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:57.680]
Yeah.

[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.200]
Boy, he had a super book.

[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.240]
Now, we don't want to take any credit for bringing some of those people over here.

[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.020]
Rodgers applauding him.

[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.440]
Congratulations, Rodgers.

[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.260]
You guys deserve him.

[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.760]
And on midday, let's see, we don't care about any of this doing that.

[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.600]
I wouldn't care about that.

[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.520]
Let's take a look at the afternoon drive, because I know Stan is listening and he's out there.

[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.400]
Oh, boy, this is great.

[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:18.940]
This is great.

[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.020]
This is great.

[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.280]
Okay, let's see.

[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:27.680]
IOD with a 4-6 in the afternoon, ranking fifth Steve with another big number there, 25 to 54.

[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.500]
Let's see how the demos compare between Steve and Alice.

[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.120]
Steve had a 4-6 in 25 to 54.

[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.780]
And Alice had, let's see, can we lie that in a pretty far?

[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.160]

[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.860]
Zeta stayed with a 2-3 in there.

[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.080]
INZ went from a 1-8 to a 1-9.

[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.860]
They had a marginal minimal game with an embarrassing number.

[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:46.380]
Flat.

[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:47.560]
Where is Alice?

[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.240]
Can you go down that far?

[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:50.720]
Oh, here it is.

[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.000]
Alice from a 2-0 to a 1-8.

[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.140]
So their audience is getting older by the moment.

[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.880]
In fact, they better slow down the hands of time.

[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.300]
Or they're going to wind up their audience is going to be dead.

[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.020]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.700]
All right, now let's see.

[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.620]
Midday, 25 to 54 here.

[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.780]
We ought to look at that, shouldn't we?

[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.200]
I mean, again, since we went up overall, I guess we had a little bit, we goosed in a little.

[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.040]
Yes, the butt-looking duck would say.

[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:16.480]
Exactly.

[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.500]
Oh, let's see.

[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.440]
IOD from a 2-1 to a 3-1.

[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.660]
2-1 to a 3-1.

[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.420]
To give you an idea back in the spring, they had a 1-5 here.

[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.280]
25 to 54, then a 2-2 with 2-7 with 2-1, and then a 3-1.

[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.600]
Good place to start.

[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.200]
I like that.

[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.560]
So evidently, those last couple of weeks goosed some things a little bit.

[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.320]
Okay, that takes care of that.

[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:37.980]
Don't worry, folks.

[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.760]
We'll get the show going when we're good and ready.

[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.880]
Okay, there's a lot of people in the business depend on it because their management won't tell them any of this.

[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.020]
They get all bent out of shape and all nervous and hysterical and believe me, most of them deserve it.

[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.620]
Okay, 6-1, it's been that 18 to 34.

[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.780]
Now, we had a giant number on Zeta.

[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.960]
We had a 9-9, and in two weeks they dropped to a 6-9.

[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:56.540]
Mm-hmm.

[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.960]
In 18 to 34, they lost a third of the audience.

[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.180]
They'd turned the corner.

[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.640]
They'd corrected the problem.

[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.220]
Now they're on their way over there.

[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.920]
They are on their way.

[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.140]
No problem at all.

[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:08.920]
And we were the problem.

[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.140]
Let's see if there are any 18 to 34s that showed up midday in IOD.

[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:18.200]
I think it's unlikely here 10 to 3, but let's just take a peak from a 0.9 to a 1-2.

[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.760]
So that's a little increase, but it's going to take time.

[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.160]
Although a 1-2 is the highest number that shows on the sheet here.

[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.720]
The next one's going to be real interesting when the whole fall book comes down to you.

[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.480]
That's where I'll be.

[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.600]
It's going to be really fascinating.

[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.240]
Now, what's this stuff at the bottom here?

[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.620]
35 to 64.

[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.080]
Oh, you made that to the end of the S numbers.

[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.440]
Yeah, we're starting to get to them.

[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.240]
Although, let's see, I already had a 5-9, third in a market.

[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.600]
And W snooze.

[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.860]
Now, see, that's too young for W snooze.

[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.780]
They drop from a 3-9 to a 3-0.

[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.400]
So the overwhelming majority of their audience now is 65-plus.

[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:56.080]
I mean, if you've got, listen, if you've got Metamusel to sell, if you've got like a dukelax,

[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.160]
if you have a polident, and W snooze is the station for you folks, trust me what I tell you.

[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.120]
They have no competition.

[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.060]
65-plus men, they are on a run, if I can say that.

[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:06.960]
Okay.

[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:07.760]
They are doing it.

[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.260]
But that nighttime number is Zeta.

[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.580]
0.7.

[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.760]
I want you to keep in mind, that's a 100,000-watt, classy FM.

[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.900]
A monster signal.

[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.600]
Well, it's on that tower, so it's not like a wounded monster.

[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.920]
And a 0.7.

[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.780]
Now, for a guy like Rose, who keeps claiming they're going in the right direction,

[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.520]
when what's her name, when old douchebag Jean Cashman was there at night,

[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.040]
she was in the threes for a while.

[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.360]
I remember.

[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:38.920]
Sure.

[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.960]
Shortly after we went there and things started rolling, and they got along,

[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.140]
and they were twos and some threes, and we were going up, you know, toward a 5 and then the 5-5,

[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.660]
and they dropped to a 4-1.

[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.760]
And I don't want to sound like I'm gloating, but I sure am.

[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.400]
Because I wish them, and there's some nice people over there, Captain Dave,

[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.740]
and God's is a good guy, although minimal, terrible show.

[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.780]
But there's some good folks, but I wish them such bad luck, not individually,

[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.500]
but I mean the company, and the management over there, both upper and middle level.

[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.840]
And again, Rose, if you take them out of the business, a good guy, but you can't separate,

[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:15.680]
that would be like saying that Hitler was a nice guy if you took them out of the government.

[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.600]
You know, you'd be a good guy to go to a party, whether something like that.

[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.580]
You cannot separate people from their roles in life.

[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.820]
And as a radio person, he just a disaster was.

[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.500]
I mean, he just stubborn.

[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.240]
He just refuses to change out of music.

[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.120]
He continues to try to find scapegoats and blames everybody for all the things that are going wrong.

[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.580]
And then, you know, he finally got this free hand, and they're going to let him do it, man.

[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.440]
He's doing it, and they're just, they're bombing.

[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.660]
I mean, they're going to wind up the next trip.

[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.580]
When the book comes out, they will be under it too.

[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.140]
I predict.

[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:43.820]
Absolutely.

[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.560]
And that may not mean a lot to those of you out there who are not in the business,

[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.520]
but to those of us who are remotely related to the business, and the people who work over there,

[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.620]
I can only say are remotely related to the world.

[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.620]
What's going on here with Roger?

[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.660]
He just jumped up and down like Rumpel Stiltsky, man.

[00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.720]
He's having a nervous breakdown.

[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:00.600]
What now?

[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.460]
What is it that we're doing or that you did?

[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.780]
I'm sorry, not that we're doing.

[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.760]
What is it that you did?

[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.120]
You know, it looks like he's erased the last week's logger tape.

[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.940]
Don't worry about it.

[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.100]
Okay, life goes on.

[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:13.700]
That was one radio.

[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.920]
You had that conversation.

[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.440]
You know the one I'm talking about.

[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.460]
Now don't choke on it.

[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:21.400]
Relax.

[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.520]
Try to control yourself.

[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.360]
Well, so anyway, those are the basic numbers there.

[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.660]
If anybody has a specific question about it, they're favorite stations.

[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.440]
You know how he was like grabbing his head and just freeing down.

[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.060]
And he just left.

[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.020]
He said, I'm going home.

[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.260]
Finally, he looked like he was reacting to that emotional in our show.

[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.620]
Emotes during the renearie show and then kind of unwinds from 10 to 11.

[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.560]
But he's gone.

[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.160]
I think he just took off and we're on automatic pilot now.

[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.020]
So let's have a hell of a tie.

[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:46.360]
Fighting.

[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.140]
Yeah, let's really go nuts.

[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.120]
You know what I mean?

[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.260]
So anyway, that's where we stand.

[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.180]
And now, didn't he look to you that look on his face like he was looking at that night number at Zeta?

[00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:58.940]
Didn't that in that one?

[00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.120]
Yeah.

[00:15:59.260 --> 00:15:59.620]
Yeah.

[00:15:59.620 --> 00:15:59.680]
Yeah.

[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:04.020]
No, seriously, when he heard that point seven after he gave us that drum roll, he just about fell off the chair.

[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:10.020]
And he covered up his whole face with his hands and just was twirling and puking and having an nervous breakdown.

[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.280]
Well, anyway, well, he finally came back.

[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.520]
He was on his way home and he said, okay, it wasn't that bad.

[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.680]
Don't worry about it.

[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.160]
Well, you're pleased.

[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.040]
You're just too emotional, okay?

[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.340]
Life goes on.

[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:19.560]
All right.

[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.980]
There are plenty of other jobs in the market.

[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.800]
Basically, with these friends, they're ought to be okay.

[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:31.740]
And I also want to say with these trends, the fact that there are some talented people, I don't want to mention any of my personal friends sitting on a sidelines,

[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.340]
who've been out of work for much too long.

[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.540]
And some of these Yahoo's out there that continue with their fractional numbers.

[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.980]
I mean, with audiences that can't be found with a telescope.

[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.780]
That's really sad.

[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:42.480]
You know, that are high-tech.

[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.100]
It's a real hip-hop.

[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.040]
I want to bush-league market.

[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.360]
This isn't what kind of management generally is in this market.

[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.680]
Unlike here, where we have sensational management.

[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.300]
We really do.

[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.840]
I know that sounds...

[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:56.020]
It sounds butt-licking, but since the butt-licking ducking theory can take credit for it.

[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:56.480]
But really do.

[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.380]
These people here have got their stuff together.

[00:16:58.980 --> 00:16:59.340]
Finally.

[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.240]
It took them a long time.

[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:00.820]
I'll tell you that.

[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.640]
But they finally got some idea what's going on.

[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:03.960]
Okay, it's 10.35.

[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.880]
Here's a guy who's always got some idea.

[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.460]
At least generally, what's going on?

[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:08.580]
Henry Barrow with the news update.

[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.400]
And we'll come right back.

[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.560]
Well, why are you working very much?

[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.140]
As is the king.

[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.420]
I don't have him in the realm much for a while.

[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.340]
But I want you all to know, what up here in Rock and Roll Heaven.

[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.680]
Although, I think it'll be a risk Christmas.

[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.200]
I'd like to give you all a special Christmas message.

[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.660]
A message of peace.

[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.760]
Like, how about a little piece of that time going by?

[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.940]
Like, I got a lot.

[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.700]
Well, I call it a friend.

[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.160]
Christmas is a time of hoot.

[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.300]
Time of joy.

[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:45.700]
A time of roll-out.

[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.240]
And I share with a lot of faith that's that feature you got there.

[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:50.400]
Okay.

[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.240]
What would you like?

[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.420]
Roll Roll Roll.

[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.680]
Oh, yeah, Christmas.

[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.760]
Christmas to me means family.

[00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.560]
Family means friends.

[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.640]
The friends means getting together.

[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.580]
And getting together means eating.

[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.800]
Pass me that time to say, which boys?

[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:06.760]
Well, flaky.

[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:07.280]
Like a runway.

[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.180]
Now, I just want to say to you right now, you know,

[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.000]
I'm maybe a big star, maybe too big.

[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.780]
But ain't nobody so big.

[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.160]
You can't reach out a helping hand.

[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.800]
Or a helping hand.

[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.400]
Or would you hand me a helping those my status over there?

[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:23.940]
Which boys?

[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:24.700]
Like it.

[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:25.440]
Make it a must.

[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.480]
Now, like I was saying, ain't nobody so big.

[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.340]
You can't stoop to help a friend of need over the holiday season.

[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.660]
Speaking of season, you won't pass me that soft sugar when you get the chance.

[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.140]
Like it.

[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.000]
Yeah, just those screws of color.

[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:39.760]
Like it.

[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:40.260]
I don't know.

[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.440]
So this Christmas, why don't y'all take a tip from old A.O.

[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.780]
Now, I'll leave those stay tips right where they are.

[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.300]
You know what I mean?

[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.100]
I appreciate it.

[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:53.200]
I want you to remember, for all the power of God's great big family,

[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.960]
and you know what God made man into his own image.

[00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.400]
And look at the mirror.

[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.840]
I'd have to say God must be a big, big son of a gun.

[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.560]
You know what I mean?

[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.680]
I like you dear.

[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.800]
But I especially want y'all to remember this one last thing.

[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.360]
You know all this homeless Christmas stringing that popcorn up on the tree,

[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.540]
save a big, big bowl for the king.

[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.400]
Next to butter, you know what I mean?

[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:16.420]
I like you dear.

[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:17.260]
I like you.

[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.100]
I like you.

[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.700]
And make the good news be yours.

[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.700]
By the way, somebody gave us a bum steer about Ralph Redneck the other day.

[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.080]
Remember they said he's going to channel 12.

[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:26.540]
That's a lot.

[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.160]
We just signed two more years of channel six.

[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.860]
I heard it on this year radio place this morning.

[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.940]
Okay, do you have an Elvis thing before we started?

[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.420]
We were looking at these people are getting this is out of roll early.

[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.180]
They have some t-shirts you can get like backwards, don't fat birds don't fly.

[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:39.740]
Well here's one.

[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.020]
Paul is dead and Elvis is alive.

[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:42.460]
Oh yeah.

[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.400]
I thought we knew that.

[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.480]
In fact, Paul is Elvis.

[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:47.540]
Okay.

[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.740]
Because you never you see him hanging out together.

[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.360]
You see Paul and Michael Jackson once in a while.

[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:52.760]
Yeah.

[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.040]
Well that's a hell of a point.

[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:54.340]
All right.

[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.140]
We got a couple of brown lines still not lit,

[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.900]
which is a little they're a little slow on the uptake up there these days.

[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.500]
524 WIOD.

[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:03.800]
524 9463.

[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.040]
Now let's take the call first about the ratings in Miami.

[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:06.400]
Hello.

[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:08.440]
Are they gone?

[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.120]
The other gone.

[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.260]
Well I must have been in the time box.

[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.960]
Or did I punch the wrong one?

[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.420]
I'm not sure.

[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:14.760]
Hello.

[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.680]
Now I don't understand, but that thing is still doing some bizarre stuff.

[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.420]
Oh don't tell me.

[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.740]
Don't tell me we're going to have another one of those.

[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.620]
I'll try one more time.

[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:26.380]
Hello.

[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.100]
Hello.

[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.220]
See there is somebody there.

[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.940]
Well these were in the off position.

[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.400]
Or in the on position.

[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.140]
I don't know.

[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:34.940]
And go ahead sir.

[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:35.280]
I'm sorry.

[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.500]
We're all screwed up as usual.

[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:38.140]
Sir.

[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.040]
Yeah I'm here.

[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:39.560]
Money line.

[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.080]
Okay.

[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:41.480]
Go ahead.

[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.160]
I'm trying to know what the top 10 stations in the market were.

[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.720]
The top 10 stations in order.

[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:47.660]
In order.

[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.000]
Wow.

[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:48.900]
You don't ask for much.

[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:49.440]
Do you sir?

[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.760]
And also how did radio station WEDR do?

[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.960]
WEDR always does very well.

[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:55.460]
Very well.

[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.600]
And I will tell you in just a second as soon as I can find that.

[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.060]
Well I got more stuff here than Carter's got pills.

[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:02.660]
You know what I mean?

[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.560]
That bill wise.

[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.200]
That bill wise.

[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.980]
Could you give me a breakdown on EDI's different day part?

[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:07.740]
Oh gee.

[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.560]
You want to lie.

[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:08.960]
Okay.

[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.300]
I'll do that as we go along.

[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:10.700]

[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.640]
But I mean, okay.

[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.100]
Here we go.

[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.080]
The top 10 stations.

[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.140]
This is, oh this is not even the right sheet.

[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:15.600]
Man.

[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.160]
This is 25 to 54.

[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.000]
God almighty.

[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:19.800]
Here's weekends.

[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.860]
But I give this back to Spike.

[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:22.920]
It's going to be so messed up.

[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:23.880]
He's going to be apoplectic.

[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.260]
Well, he can straighten it out himself.

[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:25.980]
Okay.

[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.480]
12 plus WLYF lifeless with an 8.

[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:30.800]
WPOW5.

[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:31.900]
WIOD.

[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:32.420]
A46.

[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:33.580]
QBA.

[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.140]
A46.

[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:34.960]
EDR.

[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:35.480]
A44.

[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.340]
They were number five.

[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:36.800]
Okay sir.

[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.420]
A magic of 42.

[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:39.700]
WSNEWS.

[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:40.200]
A4O.

[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:40.800]
They were seventh.

[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.340]
Hot with a 39.

[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.200]
They were tied for eighth with CMQ.

[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:44.980]
A Spanish station.

[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:44.980]

[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:45.520]
139.

[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.540]
Y100 was 10th with a 38.

[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:49.340]
Okay sir.

[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.020]
Thank you very much.

[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:51.740]
Thank you very much.

[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:52.300]
How do I help?

[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.840]
I made a good news viewers.

[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.020]
Both the brown lines that were on lit are still on lit.

[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.220]
Maybe it's going to be one of those days.

[00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.920]
Did we chase him away with all this boring stuff?

[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:00.920]
I don't really care.

[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.520]
Because this is, you know, you're going to have to get used to it.

[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.040]
Because once a month, the trends come out from Arbitron, which is part of the book.

[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.400]
It's like a rolling thing.

[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.120]
And then of course the full book will be out next month.

[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:12.860]
And we give that information on the year.

[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.400]
Who saw an upside down Zeta plate?

[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.100]
You did Roger saw an upside down Zeta plate.

[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:17.800]
Right yesterday.

[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.040]
And if he had seen these numbers, there's more than a plate's upside down.

[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:21.580]
I'll tell you that.

[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.320]
In fact, Rosa's plates are upside down in his mouth as we speak now.

[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:26.860]
Oh no, they saw the problem.

[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:27.720]
Yeah, they saw the problem.

[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.420]
They've turned the corner.

[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:28.980]
They've turned the corner.

[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.420]
Unfortunately, they didn't realize it was a dead end street that they turned the corner on.

[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.640]
Madness, dead man's curve.

[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.400]
And even Jan and Dean can't help them now.

[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.940]
Oh Miami, hello.

[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:37.720]
Hi Neil.

[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:38.440]
How are you doing?

[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:39.400]
I'm Huddard.

[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:39.920]
Hi.

[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:40.400]
Who's this?

[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:41.900]
This is John.

[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.880]
Oh, John, you sounded just like Joey.

[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:44.580]
Do you remember Joey?

[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.440]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.800]
Yeah, Joey is one of our regular faithful callers.

[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.240]
Neil, I want to ask you a question.

[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.140]
What's the question, John?

[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:54.100]
I was in Washington for the summer just visiting.

[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:54.600]
Yeah.

[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.460]
And I listened to this guy called the grease.

[00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.420]
The grease man.

[00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:58.800]
Yeah.

[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.820]
Do I know him?

[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:01.580]
I know who he is.

[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.020]
Well, he, I was listening to him.

[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.580]
And he was saying all this Jewish stuff.

[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.780]
He's putting all this Jewish bits and all this.

[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.260]
Really?

[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.180]
The grease man?

[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:13.640]
Yeah.

[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:14.640]
Huh.

[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:15.540]
Well, there are a lot of books.

[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.640]
That's how you're my last name, but I think he was just...

[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:17.840]
Yeah.

[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.620]
Like Giuseppe Papalardi.

[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:20.060]
Yeah.

[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.720]
So what's the question, John?

[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.260]
That's the question.

[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.160]
What is the question?

[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.840]
Well, I just asked you.

[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.120]
Did he just ask me a question?

[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.660]
I didn't hear the question mark, John.

[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:31.860]
After your statement.

[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:32.240]
Okay.

[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.120]
Let's try it again.

[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:33.980]
Is he Jewish?

[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:34.620]
Yeah.

[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.580]
Oh, I don't have anything.

[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.440]
I don't know.

[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.840]
Okay, you have a nice Simka Stora.

[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.200]
Okay, and have a good Chivuas.

[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:41.540]
Okay.

[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.100]
Bye, John.

[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.680]
By the way, with a Goyish, your name like John.

[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.780]
What the hell is he worried about?

[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:46.780]
That's Chivuas.

[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.560]
Did he say his name was John?

[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:49.440]
Yeah.

[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:53.440]
Boy, that is not what you call your run of the mill Jewish name.

[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.300]
He must be honorary, like I am.

[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:57.680]
Yeah, right.

[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.800]
You've been hanging around too many of your Steve's rabbis.

[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:01.700]
I think that's your problem.

[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.060]
Open line in Dade County.

[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:04.560]
751 WIOD.

[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:04.940]
Miami.

[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:05.400]
Hello.

[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:05.860]
Neil.

[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:06.480]
Yes, sir.

[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.100]
What's the question?

[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.720]
Now, the question is, was the rabbis circumscience.

[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.660]
No, but my name is John too, but it's J.O.N.

[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.660]
This is really, you know, you know.

[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:12.800]
All right.

[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:17.560]
Now, John, let me ask you, if you are Jewish, there'd be one of the great miracles in a history of mankind.

[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.100]
I am.

[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:18.880]
It's J.O.N.

[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:19.740]
Get out of here.

[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.180]
I'm, I, what I lie to you.

[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:22.560]
Hey, duck, I guess.

[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.100]
Well, there's only one way for you to come down here and prove it, John.

[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:25.400]
Really?

[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.220]
I said hi to the duck, but he didn't hear me, I guess.

[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.140]
No, hi, John.

[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.000]
Oh, that's because I was talking at the same time.

[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:30.800]
Is this J.O.N.

[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.500]
That's all with differentiates between me and that, uh, that's a four-year-old, but just called.

[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.300]
That's right.

[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.380]
Anyway, come on.

[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.160]
He wasn't four. He was at least six or seven.

[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:39.420]
All right.

[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.060]
Move right along.

[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.500]
How did chronic Cox do over there?

[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:42.840]
Oh, he did well.

[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:43.740]
How do you know?

[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:45.860]
You read the afternoon number of power.

[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:46.480]
You did?

[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:47.020]
I did.

[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.060]
Yeah, you did.

[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:48.700]
I did, really.

[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:49.340]
Yeah.

[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.660]
I guess I better put that stinkin' pipe down.

[00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:53.480]
How many spoke of it?

[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:53.660]

[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.400]
So I don't eat.

[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.960]
Let's see, three to seven, twelve plus power.

[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:57.700]
Oh, he had a big number.

[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:02.000]
I'll go down, drop from a six, two to a five, five, but he was still second-beyond lifeless.

[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.080]
Yeah, pretty well then.

[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:03.540]
Oh, yeah.

[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.700]
And Y-100 had a four-eight in the afternoon, so he'd be eaten by almost a full point.

[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:10.640]
I hate to get in the sports, but I'm the only one today that's upset that the fish won, you know?

[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.460]
No, you're not the only one.

[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.740]
We heard the mystery picker this morning in the whole song of the dance, all the brown spans and everything.

[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.940]
I don't want to hear about it.

[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.080]
No, you're upset because of the draft picker.

[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:20.280]

[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.680]
I don't want to, I mean, what's the reason to win right now?

[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.900]
Well, let's, now, come on.

[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.560]
Let's face it.

[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.260]
They got to go out there and give it a shot.

[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:26.880]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.280]
They can't just go over and roll, go out and roll over and play dead just to get the number one draft pick.

[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:31.620]
Yeah.

[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:32.660]
Oh, well.

[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:33.500]
Are you gonna be okay?

[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.000]
No.

[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.000]
Because they got something to think about, okay, and that's empty seats in the stadium next year.

[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.600]
Yeah, but if they get some great draft picks, they have nothing to worry.

[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.360]
I mean, look, they'll have them.

[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.180]
Well, people don't go to games based on draft picks.

[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.940]
They go to games based on how many, what if you won lately?

[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.340]
You know, that's how this town is.

[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.200]
But look what they did.

[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:49.680]
They had 61.

[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.340]
The paper predicted 45 and they had 61 there.

[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.260]
So I don't want to get sports, uh...

[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.140]
No, let's not get to sports intensive.

[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.020]
If somebody we know not to mention any names will become a surly.

[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.040]
This has all been covered over...

[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.480]
Start giving us names of tennis players who haven't been born yet.

[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.360]
And we'll be covered again tonight at 6th.

[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:04.760]
I agree.

[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.300]
Intensively on sports tone.

[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:06.820]
Okay.

[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.320]
Live from Tony Romas and Davey.

[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.240]
We'll be there.

[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:10.720]
Okay.

[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:11.620]
Wack, wack.

[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:13.400]
Now that's cute.

[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.240]
Now that will be a little new wrinkle for the show there.

[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:15.960]
I like that.

[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.320]
It's 10-14 Neo Rogers.

[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.180]
On News Talk, Radio 6-10.

[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.940]
10-51 at WIOD, Lighthouse Point.

[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:22.300]
Hello.

[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:23.140]
Yeah, Neo, hi.

[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:23.740]
How you doing?

[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.020]
Good.

[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.200]
Uh, what do you want later now?

[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:25.880]
You sure I'm later?

[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.420]
Am I on a later?

[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:27.660]
I don't know.

[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:28.160]
You want longer?

[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.540]
I heard you're on A up to two yesterday.

[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:29.920]
No, no.

[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.000]
Steve was at a Bob Grove's funeral yesterday.

[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.780]
So we stayed for another hour for next hour.

[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.040]
Oh, what time are you getting off today?

[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.780]
What time are you getting off today?

[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:37.160]
Yeah.

[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.860]
Two o'clock as far as I know, sir.

[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:39.860]
That's not what I meant.

[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:40.960]
What time are you getting off with your boyfriend?

[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.200]
Oh, that's cute.

[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:42.640]
I don't know.

[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.040]
Bob, what time are you planning on it, sir?

[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:44.800]
I don't know.

[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.140]
Tell me.

[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:45.780]
Okay, yeah.

[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.840]
10-52 that was Lighthouse Point.

[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.860]
We really get calls from there because the brain debt are like all jammed in to little parts

[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:52.540]
of Lighthouse Point.

[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.020]
Isn't that close to Pompano Beach, by the way?

[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:55.420]
Yeah.

[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.360]
That's very close.

[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:57.020]
Yeah.

[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.960]
It's up in that general brain debt area.

[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.940]
You've been hanging around up there too long, pal.

[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.040]
It's obviously affecting you.

[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.860]
Open-line and Broward, 524, WIOD.

[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.180]
We'll go to, oh, this will clean things up a little bit.

[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:07.620]
Sunrise.

[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:08.480]
Hi, Neo.

[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:09.100]

[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.400]
Hi, I just wanted to say goodbye.

[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.360]
I'm going to be going to Japan for three and a half months.

[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.640]
Three and a half months?

[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.740]
Yeah, for vacation.

[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.920]
And then when I come back in April, I'm going up the Rochester.

[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.520]
Go to RIT.

[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:21.720]
Great.

[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.660]
Well, I wish you good luck, sir.

[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.600]
I sent you a tape on with the $15 and enough posters.

[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.920]
It was at 20, I think, we decided yesterday.

[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:30.780]

[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.260]
Right, and then you could just send it to me.

[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.000]
What?

[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.520]
And you could send it to me?

[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:36.360]
I'll be delighted.

[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.460]
Okay, thank you very much.

[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.840]
Okay, so you have a good time.

[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:39.400]
All right, thanks.

[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:39.840]
Bye-bye.

[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.540]
Don't take any wooden nickels over there either.

[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.960]
Okay, you know, there's Japanese man.

[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.880]
1053, 7411 at WIOD.

[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.600]
And that vocal line hasn't let that's the problem.

[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.940]
That's the only one that's kind of like a real deadhead this morning.

[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.140]
278 WIOD that line seven.

[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:56.980]
I'm very mad at you.

[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.580]
It's because when I start asking them to call, then you know that you got to be a real

[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.600]
assident guy on the M side.

[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:04.600]
Date County.

[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:04.900]
Hello.

[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.140]
Good morning, Neo.

[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:06.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:07.960]
That was $15 yesterday.

[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.160]
But that's okay, I was going to send $20.

[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.100]
No, no, you didn't listen long enough.

[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.180]
We were negotiating the whole thing and at the end I was convinced somebody

[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.200]
talked me into $20.

[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.620]
All right, I must have turned down the machine.

[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.940]
As far as the tape goes though, is it going to have the golf game on it?

[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:23.740]
No.

[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.700]
How about a young Neo?

[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:31.100]
See, now the problem is if we're going to start negotiating what's going to be on the tape.

[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.920]
I'm just asking, I'm not negotiating.

[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:33.520]
Okay.

[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:34.540]
I mean, I'll do it anyway.

[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.380]
I mean, yeah, I think I will put a young Neo on it because I don't like playing it on here.

[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.160]
It's too damn long.

[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.020]
It goes on forever.

[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:44.220]
And I've heard it a million times and I think it's lost a little of the original

[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.020]
lustre, you know what I mean?

[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.480]
I mean, after the 4,000 time to me, it just isn't that great anymore.

[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.320]
I've put it on there, then the people who want to hear it instead of bugging me can listen to it.

[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.360]
Yeah, I've only heard it once.

[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.060]
So, you know, I've got a few more thousand to go.

[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:56.940]
Okay.

[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.080]
Listen, one other question.

[00:28:58.840 --> 00:28:59.960]
Who is Sandy Foxx?

[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.140]
And did he have a TV show in New York years ago?

[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:03.780]
Sandy Foxx.

[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.540]
That's Sandy Patens' brother-in-law.

[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.560]
So it's not Sandy Foxxx.

[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.680]
I can understand why you can't comprehend the name because you can't understand what

[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.280]
Sonny says.

[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.360]
Sonny Foxx.

[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.340]
Oh, it's Sonny Foxx.

[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:15.640]
That's right.

[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:16.160]
Sonny Foxx.

[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:16.920]
Not in New York.

[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:22.220]
Sonny, he used to do the old Rotten movies on Channel 6 on the weekend once a month of

[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.480]
time in his Hawaiian Luao shirts.

[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.760]
But Sonny was on Sheep for a long time and now he's on Y-100-9.

[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.700]
But I was just here in Miami.

[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.960]
And I'm sure he's on his way right now with his $500 check for Camila's house.

[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:32.600]
Right.

[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.560]
Well, one last thing.

[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.400]
I had a friend in college, his name was Matthew.

[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.260]
His brother's name was John and his other brother's name was Paul and they were all Jewish.

[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.220]
Well, he must have been in the related to the original apostles, huh?

[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:45.940]
Yeah, well, go figure that one out.

[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.780]
I don't, I'll be honest with you.

[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.040]
I can't think of anybody I've known in my life whose name was John who was Jewish.

[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.300]
Well, that one kicked me when Matthew walked in.

[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.380]
He said, obviously being Jewish.

[00:29:59.180 --> 00:29:59.480]
Matt.

[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.000]
Well, Matt.

[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.800]
No, I think Matt can be a Jewish name.

[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.460]
Yeah, in fact, there are a lot of Matt's.

[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:03.960]
Okay.

[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:09.060]
And Paul, there's a lot of Jewish Paul's, but John is a very, if you pardon the expression,

[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:09.820]
goyish name.

[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:11.460]
Very goyish name.

[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.580]
I don't know any Arabs named John either.

[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.180]
So it's not one of those Semitic names.

[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.220]
Okay, listen, have a great one.

[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:16.580]
Yeah, I agree.

[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.120]
Bye-bye.

[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.280]
Okay, now let me go back to this thing that we mentioned yesterday and we ought to straighten it out

[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.960]
because we were involved in this ongoing negotiating kind of thing.

[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.640]
And I will, this Sunday, I will have to come in because I'm going to put that tape together

[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.560]
and put some of this other millions of bits on cart finally.

[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:36.640]
But anyway, under much duress and is a different way to raise some more money for a Camille

[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.460]
House in an ongoing effort, not just now, but in the weeks to come.

[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:45.380]
If you will send a donation of $20 or more, a check or money order made out to Camille House.

[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.560]
And a, let's get this right, a cassette, 90 minute cassette.

[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.120]
Stamped self-adressed envelope is optional, but would be helpful, okay?

[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:56.900]
Asking for that.

[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:01.540]

[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.840]
Then we will send you a cassette of all these different bits that we're going to play.

[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.980]
A lot of the stuff you hear us play on the year, not all of it, of course, but, you know, 45 minutes worth.

[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.160]
That'll be on one side of the cassette.

[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.660]
And one thing I'm going to tell you, like I don't know yet how much is going to be on here.

[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.440]
It'll be 35 minutes or 40 minutes.

[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:20.000]
When you get it, don't call or write and say,

[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.600]
Gee, the other side was blank.

[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.000]
Couldn't you put something on the other side?

[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.760]
I'll never forget that as long as I have some of these ungrateful doings.

[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.280]
Great.

[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:33.600]
That just wants you to, you know, they think that everybody in the world has got nothing in their life, but them.

[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:33.880]
Yeah.

[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:37.420]
And they're going to just sit down and do a whole song and a dance on both sides of it.

[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.600]
It's a big enough of a pain to dub all these off.

[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.720]
And I know Rich isn't even aware yet the work that he's going to have in tail.

[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.340]
I know I feel we can probably find somebody who's got high speed dubbing equipment.

[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:51.040]
Like maybe, um, maybe our friend Rich Pactor is somebody who's like in the music business.

[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:51.540]
Maybe.

[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:52.140]
I don't know.

[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.300]
And I think to it would know somebody who can dub them for us.

[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:54.700]
It's amazing.

[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:59.760]
You said yesterday that people would not listen long enough and would send in 10 or 15 dollars.

[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.180]
You said that yesterday and already, you know, couple of calls this morning.

[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.900]
Oh, Roger says we do have a high speed dub here, but it sucks.

[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.660]
Well, we don't want that.

[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.460]
We don't want them to suck.

[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.860]
We want them to be at least reasonable so we don't get a lot of complaints and mouth contents.

[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:11.880]
We have enough of those already.

[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.100]
Pembroke Pines.

[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:13.400]
Hello.

[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.160]
Hey, Neil.

[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:14.680]
Yeah.

[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.240]
How's it going?

[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.040]
Oh, man.

[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:16.720]
What a question.

[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:17.320]
Wow.

[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.100]
Let me ponder that for a little while.

[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.540]
No, we're doing fine.

[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:21.940]
Okay.

[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.920]
Don't be sensitive now.

[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.420]
Don't start getting like that funny fox.

[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.520]
Oh, no, no way.

[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.140]
No way.

[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.600]
I happen to like funny fox, but you're right.

[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.400]
He's a good guy, but he's just a little sensitive.

[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.600]
Yeah, he is a bit too sensitive.

[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.940]
Like I mean, thin skinned.

[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:32.200]
Yeah.

[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:32.480]
Oh.

[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.500]
Now that hot beat him, he's going to really be upset.

[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:34.920]
Sure.

[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:35.680]
Oh, the wait a minute.

[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.000]
Wait a minute.

[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:36.640]
Let's get a writer.

[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.460]
He'll call again.

[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.420]
Maybe in the morning.

[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.840]
Anything we can do.

[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:40.800]
Let's get a straight.

[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.120]
We say they beat him in the morning and they didn't.

[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.280]
He'll be right on that thing.

[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:45.060]
And he'll be.

[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:45.480]
Yeah.

[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.500]
Just a minute.

[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:46.960]
Let me look.

[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.780]
Let me find mornings here.

[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.900]
I have to enter the news to put this down.

[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:51.300]

[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:51.800]
All right, go ahead.

[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.000]
When you're talking, I'll find it.

[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:53.500]
Okay.

[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.020]
First of all, I'm not Jewish.

[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.000]
My name is Joey.

[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.140]
And second of all, how does magic do some tend to do?

[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.240]
Are you Italian, Joy?

[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:00.640]
Yeah.

[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.540]
Well, there you go.

[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.680]
See, there's some guy who makes sense anyway.

[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.720]
He's what he's supposed to be.

[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.080]
Sure.

[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.180]
Oh, let's see.

[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.120]
Oh, God.

[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.540]
Am I going to find anything now?

[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:14.120]
Spike is going to go crazy when he sees his magic from a midday,

[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.580]
from a six five down to a five six,

[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.320]
but there's still second behind life was.

[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.300]
So they're doing just fine.

[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:19.940]
They're doing good.

[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.760]
Who is that looking for a minute ago?

[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:22.880]
Oh, sunny.

[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:23.840]
You're morning.

[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:24.740]
You were looking for sunny.

[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.780]
Oh, nice.

[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:26.620]
Let's see.

[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.760]
I don't see him here.

[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.320]
Wait a minute.

[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.280]
Does he really mumble like that on the phone?

[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:32.180]
On the ear.

[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.200]
I've yet to hear him.

[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:33.580]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.540]
I have it turned upside down.

[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.000]
Here he is.

[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.420]
You've never heard one of his hair he is.

[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.140]
He hit a four five.

[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.680]
He was fifth and he did not get beaten by a hot.

[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.560]
Hot was where the hell is hot already.

[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.640]
Oh, they're way down there with a three.

[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.160]
So I correct myself on that in the morning.

[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.340]
Sonny did very well.

[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:48.720]
Okay.

[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:49.580]
You've never heard of that.

[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.420]
He went from a four back up to a four five.

[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.120]
So he's doing fine.

[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:52.700]
I'm sorry, bird.

[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.500]
Never heard.

[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:53.960]
Never heard.

[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:54.940]
They're sunny right now.

[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.680]
Oh, he's fallen.

[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:56.940]
You'll find out yourself.

[00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:57.820]
Now listen, listen.

[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.500]
When you speak to him, listen very carefully.

[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.200]
Because you might do a couple of words.

[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:01.680]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:02.960]
Have a good one now.

[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:03.980]
Okay.

[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:04.560]
There he goes.

[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:06.360]
Okay.

[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:06.660]
Listen.

[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:07.660]
That's the end of the first hour.

[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.980]
And it seems like we just sat down.

[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:09.760]
Roger is right.

[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:14.620]
I think time is just slipping us by before you know it's going to be time for them to plant all of us in the morning.

[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:17.800]
I'm telling you it's really it is flying by.

[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.820]
Speaking of being planted in the ground, Steve canus afternoon the Charles Street case,

[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:27.500]
Game time and early release of prisoners speaking against game time is good old attorney Tom Bush.

[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.580]
And I won't say a word about him that I haven't said before pro game time.

[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.060]
Bill Lazwell, president of the Broward County Criminal Trial Lawers Association.

[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.660]
Some more contrived debates on a cane show this afternoon from two to six.

[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.160]
Only here on six ten W I O D.

[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.600]
All right.

[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:14.580]
So, I'm going to say that the first time I've ever seen a cane show in the morning,

[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:44.560]
I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say

[00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:14.540]
I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say

[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:31.160]
that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to sayrated knowing that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to sayidades a chez el Com wait Keen, eh? Hahaha

[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:44.820]
today. What did he do? That's that when you know. He's alright. Okay. Um, the, uh, the

[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:48.640]
call before about Sandy. See, this will keep you so busy. You won't have time to eat.

[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:54.300]
That's right. On your diet. Go ahead, sir. I'm sorry. Right? Sir, go ahead. Okay. Sandy

[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:59.560]
Fox was a guy on TV up in New York. He used to do the Wonderama show on, uh, W any W

[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:04.280]
TV. Well, you know, there was another sunny Fox who was on, will you listen to me just a

[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:09.280]
second sir, will you try to control yourself? I don't know Sandy Fox. Okay. However, they're

[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:14.720]
used to from Fox's deli and Rochester, but they're used to be another sunny Fox who was on

[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:20.100]
the $64,000 challenge years ago, not the same sunny phone we got here. Okay. But a different

[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.920]
side of our. Okay. And we haven't seen him today, by the way, just meant to the past. Well,

[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:27.360]
he just got off the, or at 10 o'clock, give the guy some time. Don't start ragging on him

[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.760]
later. I'll call him. Nobody got cops on a radio on the phone. So let's just relax.

[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:37.300]
Yeah. He's on. He's standing on a chronic cock. What was your story, sir? Um, I see.

[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:47.260]
I wanted to know how Joe Johnson did. Joe Johnson. Well, okay. He's a great guy. He's

[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:52.160]
got a beautiful girlfriend. A nice lady. Yeah. I like Linda. She's Superman. Mm hmm. Well,

[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.680]
I would say she's Superman, but she's super. Okay. Now, wait a minute. Let me just take

[00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:00.420]
a peek here. I got it so screwed up. Hey, here's seven of midnight right here, right on top,

[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:05.440]
which is the way Joe likes it. Okay. I'm magic. Let me tell you one thing about Joe. In

[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:10.360]
the last three trends, two six, two six, and again, a two six at night. Magic doesn't do

[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:14.640]
all that great at night. And I guess mainly they got a big 25 to 54 audience. And a lot

[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.100]
of those people at night are watching TV or going out doing living and breathing things.

[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:22.440]
They're not into radio as much. Yeah. We're all watching. Yeah. No, we're all watching

[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:27.320]
not slanting. Well, you are, but well, you know me. Okay. Talk to you later.

[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.720]
Okay, sir. Have a great life. Bye. Bye. Okay. Now, what was I just going to do? I was

[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.720]
going to talk to Cox on a radio, chronic Cox. I'm not trying to be chronic. Meal. I just

[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:39.220]
thought I'd tell you that I know several people in town who have not high speed dubbing

[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:44.720]
equipment for cassettes, but who have the ability to dub 30 or 40 at a time. That's

[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:49.160]
what we want. That's what I mean. It's good quality. Yeah. When you want that, call

[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.960]
me and I'll take care of it. Fantastic. What a guy. All right. That's exactly

[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:56.340]
the way we do. It's on another excellent. Okay. Well, I'll let real people call you.

[00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:01.820]
Even here what I said, I said congratulations on another excellent trend on all. Thanks

[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:06.580]
a lot. I am enjoying it. I bet you are. Yeah. Fortunately, fortunately, the checks are

[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:11.020]
still cashing. So I guess I still have my job. Well, Henry's got some plans for those checks.

[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.740]
All right. Yeah. Yeah. He keeps telling me that he's got some property in the South to

[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:17.800]
say the go-kaleous and thanks a lot. We'll let you know when we need it. When you need it,

[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:22.140]
just let me know because there's two or three different people in town. Good news. All

[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:27.160]
right. I'm feeling we're going to need that. Yeah, we are going to be here. Here's the

[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:31.580]
first one that came certified male one day. And this is the early wave of male that we

[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:35.600]
got right here. Yeah. So I want you to be a witness, fat rich. There's my check for 500

[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:39.440]
bucks to the Camila's house and one for a hundred. So we got almost a grand here in one

[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:44.400]
mailing with my check in there. Yeah. And when Sonny brings his check, what are you laughing

[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:48.540]
about? He's going to do it. Yeah. I think he would go on the year he'll pledge that and

[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.900]
then shine us. He would never want to give them some great addition to which he's got

[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:56.880]
more money than God anyway. True. I just want to grab my boon adds up after I just want

[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:01.480]
to bug them some. Now leave him alone. Will you please? He's emotionally at a good trend

[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:06.200]
also. It is. It'd be nice to our FM friends. Now that we're back on a M, they're all our

[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:10.800]
friends. That's correct. We were going to go back on FM again. We hit him like poison.

[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.560]
He's disgusting. And he's a human. You know, that kind of stuff. Why can't you graduate

[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:22.060]
Rose in a gang over there at the WZTA? Man, I'm telling you, I am just that they'd

[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:26.120]
made my day, my month, and the next one is going to make my life. Oh, yeah. That's the

[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:30.140]
one I want to say because you know what they say, Rose? What goeth around, come through

[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:34.660]
round. Okay. That's what they say. But you have solved the problem over there. And then

[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:38.040]
I'm going to congratulate on you on turning the corner. One thing about Cox, man, he knows

[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.120]
where to get in on this board. He called on the Palm Beach line. See that? And it's open

[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:47.220]
again vacant. It's always a list. And by the way, speaking of Lee Fowler, isn't he supposed

[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:51.540]
to be calling to at least promo to give us a little titillation on that thing he's going

[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:54.920]
to do sometime this week? I know you want to wait till Thursday when we got that open

[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:59.400]
line in Palm Beach just for you, Lee. It's great. It's a Cox broadcast. And the owner

[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:05.280]
just called moments ago, 655 W I O D in Palm Beach. I guess I better transpose the numbers

[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:12.560]
because he's a little slow. 655 9463. It's 1112 at W I O D and we'll come right back. Incredible.

[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:17.140]
1114 in my good friend Congressman Larry Smith. It's working on the beef case. You know,

[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:22.060]
the 7,000 pounds of cooked roast beef that they were going to throw out has written the

[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:26.540]
letter to the USDA urging the beef not be destroyed, but be delivered to the needy and homeless

[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:30.920]
and is going to be calling on the bat line. So that'll be great. In the meantime, we have

[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:36.620]
another very important call asking you shall receive on the Palm Beach line. I thought

[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:42.240]
this was Lee Fowler. No, a Neil. It's a Lee Fowler spy report? Yes, Neil. Yes. Yeah, John

[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:46.740]
the second up in West Palm last week. I had nothing to do. So I was snooping around on my

[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:52.380]
scanner. And I was just, yeah, is that better? Okay. I was snooping around my scanner.

[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:57.300]
And I heard on the dead you know, some of the pickup channel. I heard Lee Fowler call

[00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:02.600]
somebody on the air a sub-human. A sub-human douchebag. That's right. So I thought this

[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:08.080]
is discussion. Come on, you will get some chloroxin. Gargle your brains out. Well, I called them

[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.240]
up and I got to board up and I said, Hey, what's killing Uncle Mio's material telling

[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:16.600]
to get a wife of his own? He's not the original material. Well, the girl did not know what

[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:22.360]
to do. And now he just slammed the phone down on it. That's nice. Oh, excuse me. Sort

[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:27.200]
of. Well, you know those people up at JNO, they tend to be a little surly and squirrely,

[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.720]
sir. That's true. Just as I report and we're listening up here. Okay. Thank you. Okay.

[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:35.920]
For just a second, I thought that was really Uncle Lee on the phone. But he's, I don't

[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.440]
know, he's tinkering with us or something. I don't know what he's doing. He keeps threatening

[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.840]
to call in and give us this real hot news. And if he's got the hot news, man, he better

[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.900]
call now or forever hold his own. I think he's got his own agenda. We have, we have

[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:54.240]
an open line in Broward 524 WIOD. Let's go to Miami. Hello. Yeah. Now. Yeah. Yesterday

[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:58.320]
you were talking about somebody's drivers going around. I really horrendous. Yeah. Well,

[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.880]
the other night I got call back into work and it's towards the end of the rush hour.

[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:07.760]
And won't you know what on high speed line? There's some bimbo guy doing about 40 miles

[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:13.420]
an hour when he should have been doing 50, 55. And he had traffic all tied up. And that

[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:18.060]
really hurts me. But the worst part of it was, or over the white car he had WIOD plastered.

[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:22.160]
Oh, that's great. We don't want him. Yeah. Really? You know, and he had traffic. He's

[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.680]
doing like 35, 40 miles an hour and everybody else that trying to skirt around is kind of

[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.520]
mean time. There's 6000 cars trying to get around. Well, he's probably listening to

[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.460]
the dolphins game. You know, who the heck knows what he was doing? But he really had

[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:36.160]
it snarled up and just to let you know do something about that. Well, okay. Thank you.

[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.500]
We'll do it. We'll, we'll locate him, man. Right. Thanks. Okay. Well, at least get

[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:45.540]
the bumper stickers off his car. Yet another radio super stupid star on eight who I

[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:51.300]
have no idea who it is. Hello. Deal. Yes. He, Michael McKay. Hey, how you doing? Pretty

[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:56.620]
good. I just called because I've got a Jewish John for you. A Jewish John? Yes, sir. Boy,

[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:02.240]
oh boy. I could sure interpret that in a number of ways, especially coming from you. Do

[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.680]
you have any news report of John Purchan? Oh, yeah. I know. Johnny used to work at WS News.

[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.500]
That's right. He is a Jewish John. I'll be damned. Like I said, I know a lot of Jewish

[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:16.120]
John. Yeah, but I meant a name, John. I know what you mean. Congratulations. And if

[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:20.480]
you want to use this on your thinking data for it. Yeah. Isn't that great? Well, they certainly

[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.020]
are going to come around the corner. Oh, yeah. I don't want to wish Captain Dave any

[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.240]
bad luck because he's a good guy. But I'd hate to be the captain of the Titanic, wouldn't

[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:31.800]
you? Certainly. That station is amazing. A hundred thousand watts can be wasted. A point

[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.540]
seven at night. I'm telling you, when I saw that, that's really, it really did something

[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:40.200]
to me. And that's what it did. And keep up the good work. I'll send some money over

[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.540]
to the police station. Thank you very much, Mike. I'm fine.

[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:47.080]
Chief Michael McKay. What a day here. Yeah, this is a radio celebrity day. Of course, we

[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.500]
knew it would be because it runs around with you, Maul. And most of these people are

[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:54.500]
listening every day anyway. But hey, Congressman Larry Smith is on the phone. Hi, Larry.

[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:58.560]
How you doing? This is the ratings wizard. This is the manager of Menlo Park. I called

[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:03.580]
up to see what my ratings are. The ratings are 99.2. There are a couple of goy-am out

[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:08.800]
there who are not here. Happy. I belated about bell ringers, right? A belated happy

[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:12.360]
Hanukkah to you, Larry. And I'm so excited that you called because we've had a lot of

[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.380]
people calling me about this beef thing. And I, from a couple of people I talked to, I

[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:20.360]
thought it was hopeless and it was a lost cause. I don't know that it is. And you remember

[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:25.060]
the old, you know, saying an 84, where's the beef? Yeah. Well, we found it. Yeah, but

[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:30.800]
you did. It's about eight thousand pounds sitting in freezing lockers in various suppliers

[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:35.780]
warehouses here in South Florida. You had a program yesterday, and that's all why I

[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:42.500]
called about this. And it was an issue yesterday, but I had seen it as well last week, I believe,

[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:48.700]
and we sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture at the end of last week telling

[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:56.320]
them that if the beef should ultimately fall into the title of the United States government,

[00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:02.920]
right now we only put a lean on it. So it's frozen in these lockers and it can't be used

[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:07.900]
by anybody. Yeah, it's frozen. After legal proceedings or after administrative proceedings,

[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:14.880]
there is a fine imposed. The meat may ultimately go back to the suppliers and it would then

[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:20.140]
be used in the private chain in which it started. But if in the event the United States

[00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:29.740]
gets fines and or the meat as part of the legal decision, then I have told the USDA that

[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:35.280]
it would be absolutely immoral to destroy that beef with a number of needy people out there.

[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:40.460]
Yeah, 1127 at WIOD. Now let me just mention again the address if you want to write to the USDA,

[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:45.460]
and they'll let them know how you feel about them possibly eventually going to destroy that

[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:49.820]
beef or just let it sit there while people are starving on the streets. You can write to

[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:54.800]
Richard Ling, the Secretary of Agriculture at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA,

[00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:00.780]
Independence Avenue, Washington DC. That's Richard Ling, LING, Secretary of Agriculture,

[00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:09.400]
Care of the USDA, Independence Avenue, Washington DC. Okay, okay. And the Camilla Souses at 726

[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:13.160]
Northeast, first Avenue here in Miami for those who want to go down there on Christmas Day and

[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:18.260]
help out or those who want to bring by clothing blankets or foodstuffs. Okay, let's go to Palm Beach

[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:23.160]
and see what excitement we got here this time. Hello. Hello, this is Spike from WFLX. Just

[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:28.080]
well let you know that the Greece man is not Jewish and we're working on your new picture of

[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:32.380]
Johnny Depp. It's on the way. I'll be there. Boy, you guys are just incredible. You know what?

[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:37.200]
Hey, we appreciate it. Yeah, we appreciate all the the promo that you give us.

[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:41.880]
And thanks for that last poster, man. It's got a very special spot. There's a new one on the way,

[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:46.500]
Neil. I'll bet. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Okay, man, it is celebrity day, isn't it? Yeah,

[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:51.580]
that's right. Spike here. They got Spike up there at the Channel 29 up in the West Coast. Okay,

[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:55.500]
that Palm Beach line is open again. Lee, can you maybe I'm not talking enough allowed enough

[00:47:55.500 --> 00:48:03.240]
release? Is that possible? Yeah. He's six five five W I O D. It's it right in on celebrity day.

[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:07.380]
Here's all the other celebrities are calling me. Of course, maybe his train came out too. Maybe

[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:12.200]
that's why things are a little quiet. Although they evidently do very well up there. Do they? Yeah.

[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:18.540]
RMF does very well. The RFM RMF. Yeah. And JNO, I think this pretty darn well. Of course,

[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:22.240]
they can't the battle at PBR, man. Once they had Paul Lyle on there in the morning, that was

[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:29.800]
little too heavy for them for Lauderdale. Hello. Hello. Yes. I'm Neil and Glenn. I had a question. One

[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:36.020]
question is barely here. Pardon? I can barely hear you. Okay, hold on. Can you hear me better? Oh, yeah.

[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:43.040]
One is why do they turn off the delay during the news? That is an excellent question, which I have

[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:48.000]
never been able to figure out. I haven't got the foggy study, but Nick, I am sure is writing a

[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:54.540]
message on the screen. It says we have report. Oh, in other words, there are reporters out there

[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:58.260]
who listen off the ear. Oh, seeing if we were on delay, it would screw them all up and they wouldn't

[00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:02.760]
have no other screen reader banana. You know, Johnny Dark has the same question to mention. Well,

[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:07.460]
that answers the question. I've always wondered that. Me too. The only thing is sometimes we do it

[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:12.760]
at 34. Well, we don't have reporters. Nick doesn't do it. Roger does it just out of habit. I have it.

[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.800]
They don't always do it. My dear, Roger is a great guy, but he's a fuss budget. You know, he wants

[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:22.460]
to do everything just according to oil. Don't take it personally, Roger. So sensitive. Go ahead, sir.

[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:29.720]
Okay. The other one is how did magic do overall like 2554 or like 25 to 54? This guy has

[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:33.200]
been an interesting question, but you know, it's interesting in the last round. Of course, for a

[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:38.400]
long time now, we were number one on Zeta 25 to 54 in the morning. Yeah. You want the whole station?

[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:43.800]
Yeah, like the whole kid's caboodle. Well, this guy wants a man. We got a demanding audience here.

[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:51.700]
Let's see 25 to 54. Seven of midnight. Oh, god. This is a mess. Spike is going to have a nervous breakdown.

[00:49:52.800 --> 00:50:00.140]
Three to seven 25 to 54. Just a second. I'll get there. Trust me. This is a mess.

[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:06.700]
Magic number one and eight three in the afternoon. How do you like that? In midday 25 to 54.

[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:11.100]
Magic number one and eight nine. That's great.

[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:16.400]
6 to 10 a.m. I bet you're number one there too. Because we kind of disappeared. So number one,

[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:22.680]
6.0. Oh, 6.0. Anybody could have beaten that. But unfortunately, Zeta dropped from a 7.1 to a 5.0

[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:29.780]
into a tie with WIOD with Mike Rineri. And they're dropping like a rock, okay, sir?

[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:36.500]
Yeah. So if you were rating the stations overall and the entire day, like who would magic be number one?

[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:43.060]
No, 25 to 54. They're number one. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay. Overall. Yeah, they're doing great. Trust me.

[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.780]
Okay. Okay. Thanks. Bye. Bye.

[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:51.280]
1131, man. This audience really, they, when they want to know it, they want to know it. They want

[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.440]
just a little bit of this or a little bit of that, which is fine. We like to create these students

[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:58.260]
of broadcasting. That's correct. Because someday if they live long enough, they might actually get

[00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:02.480]
in the business. God forbid. Don't do it. I'm telling you, I haven't said that on this station yet.

[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:07.280]
Because we're doing just great. We're happier than pigs in sloppier than butt-licking ducks. But I'm telling

[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:12.240]
you, don't get in this business. This will kill you. You'll wind up a broken man or woman. It'll just

[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:17.840]
destroy your spirit. Oh, and you know what I saw yesterday. And I didn't get to see it because the

[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:22.640]
phone was ringing and my doorbell rang and all kinds of stuff going on. But I came across as I

[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:28.540]
Oprah had some horrendous, another one of these guys marrying women with children. Oh, this,

[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:34.320]
one of those stupid shows. And I come across Heraldo on the channel 12. Oh, yeah. And guess what he

[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:39.840]
had? He had John Wesley Fletcher again with what's her name? Yes. With Jessica Hahn. She was in

[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:45.900]
Phoenix, I guess. That's Blitz. And she was crying and sobbing and swearing and carrying a,

[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:51.520]
I hope you go to hell. I hope you drop dead. Here are all these good religious people, man.

[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:56.880]
Screaming at each other and calling each other names and prostitutes and all kinds of sexual

[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:01.560]
things that haven't been invented yet. And these are the same fakers, man. And get on there and

[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:06.640]
you know, built millions of dollars. All you suckers out there that send money to these religious

[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.420]
fakers out there. Why not send it to the Camilla Sound Service or the Salvation Army or some

[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:14.120]
organization that's directly going to help some people who need your help instead of giving

[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:19.140]
it to all these grave robbers. Okay. What a disgrace. Aren't you glad that they were in separate cities?

[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:23.620]
No, I think in fact, Harado probably wishes he could have happened together. I was afraid to what?

[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:30.540]
I'm working a job on his radio station now for less than 400 a week in this man has destroyed my

[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:35.440]
family. She's crying, man. She would have put Tammy Faites-Shame. She might be auditioning for Tammy

[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:41.480]
Faites-Job on a PPL. I'm telling you. I'm serious, man, because she was just floating them out there

[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:45.660]
like crazy. I thought she was going to float away. She was like Allison Wonderland.

[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:51.060]
She is. But it was something. I didn't get to see too much of it, but they were hysterical.

[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:56.860]
1134. But of course, you know, those forgiven sinners, man, those are the ones we love the most,

[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.360]
and we send the most money to. 26 before noon, April of War, then with the news up,

[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:04.120]
the couple of Soviets spies. That's why there was a little pause there, but Nick is straightening it

[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:10.280]
all out. It's 1137 at WIOD. The word from a radio spy, Doug Tract is the grease man's real name.

[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:15.900]
He is Jewish. Well, okay. Really? Well, why would some goyish or copy-playing all kinds of

[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:20.580]
Jewish material on the show? I got a rush to do in the machine, by the way, which will be playing

[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:26.080]
momentarily. But first, we have to take these very important calls, okay? Hey phone in Palm Beach,

[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:31.940]
highly. Just as a matter of fact, that's what I was going to tell you about. A leaf-hawler's

[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:36.680]
spy. Okay, if you all call in personally, let's flush him out, as they say. Mr. Wipple would say.

[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:43.180]
You know who he had on yesterday. I'm afraid to ask. They deen. What? Yes, the alien.

[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:49.220]
Oh, no. This is not a senseless relationship between Lee Fowler and Steve Kane has got to have

[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:54.200]
he straightened up. I didn't believe it. Too much male bondage, you know, with just too much going on.

[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:59.400]
Yeah, listen, I got him my car last night and turned on the radio, and I heard that the

[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:04.820]
fins were ahead 24 to 10. Yep. At that point, I knew they were going to lose. But they didn't.

[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:08.900]
You're right. I was very surprised this morning. Well, I tried their best.

[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.660]
Strock came in, you know, for the Browns and gave the old college try and tied it up there. But

[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:16.900]
the last one. Well, that's why they won. Because, you know, the rival right there between

[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:21.600]
Marino and Strock, he couldn't let Strock do it. They're good buddies. They're good buddies. I know,

[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.940]
but, you know, he's going to show that he can do it alone. In fact, I remember Strock was on my

[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:30.920]
Sunday show one time. He was in the building when I was doing the Sunday mornings on INZ.

[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:35.200]
And that was the time. Remember when Marino held out a couple of years ago, we moved to Houston

[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:39.520]
game to start the season because he wasn't ready and he held, didn't come to camp. And

[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:43.460]
brought Strock in. I asked him, doesn't Marino care about the fans or anything? And of course,

[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:47.480]
the bottom line is they'll care about the money. Just like those of us in this business,

[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:50.360]
and that's what life is coming to this country. So why should they be any different?

[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:53.880]
Yeah, but they should feel a little guilty when they go in to take them up at the window on Friday.

[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:58.040]
Yeah, that's true. But, well, maybe they just a twins, just a pang of guilt.

[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.920]
Yeah, listen, Bird, man, you shouldn't freak out so much when people start to talk about

[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:06.660]
sports. That's the only thing Miami or South Florida's got to go for it, which isn't a lot right now,

[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:11.700]
but, uh, you know, we got the Heat Man hero in 17. They're giving them the college try.

[00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:16.140]
I, at least they keep going for it. I don't see. Of course, when you give it the old college

[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:20.100]
try, you ought to be playing college teams, that might help. Wow, they, they could win one.

[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:24.120]
They might. Yes, the funny, sunny keeps predicting it, but don't hold your breath.

[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:29.800]
I didn't say anything about that. So all I said was this has been rehashed to death.

[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.000]
Yeah, four hours. They're not saying no matter what you say about sports,

[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.460]
he's going to say it's going to be done again tonight at six o'clock again.

[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:40.460]
Is that what you want, sir? Pay no attention to the buttline. Do we have to do it?

[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:42.800]
Pay no attention. No, that was my point.

[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:46.180]
Well, why don't you go to the air this morning? I mean, the first thing was,

[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:51.080]
please don't talk about the dog. I was sincere. And I want to appreciate you for calling in,

[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:55.080]
sir. Thanks very much. Well, we love you. Great. Is that it? Are you leaving now? Are you going

[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:59.060]
to be intimidated by the buttlicking doc? Well, I love the buttlicking doc. Okay. He hasn't been,

[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:06.260]
wow, I won't talk about that. But thank you. Thank you all very much. Okay, made the good

[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:10.540]
snooze viewers. Thank you. Bye-bye. Well, I'm talking to that Palm Beach line. We got a cooking

[00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:13.420]
out. I don't know where the calls are coming from, but a cheering from Palm Beach. I'll tell you

[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:17.880]
that. And we're sure not hearing from Lee Fowler. Now, maybe you think it's possible that he's

[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:22.960]
chickened out on his alleged expose that he's going to do on WOLD. You think that's possible?

[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:27.320]
No, because that would be embarrassing. You know, I mean, like when you make a gigantic pronoun

[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:32.280]
to him, as he did last week, and you predict all of these wild exposés and then all of a sudden,

[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:36.760]
you disappear into the woodwork like a termite. Nobody can flush you out. No, I think there's that

[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:41.800]
word again, man. I think he wants it. I feel a little flush now that I mentioned it. I think you

[00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:46.890]
want it at the right at his at his convenience. Well, I think he got it in his brains. Okay, Miami-B.

[00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:51.210]
Hello. Yes, this is the first time I'm calling here. Well, how you doing, pal? All right, well,

[00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:56.070]
I'm a real Jewish John. Hey, how about that? Another Jewish John. I mean, what you said about that,

[00:56:56.210 --> 00:57:00.130]
this morning, but you've got to be honest. John is not a Jewish name. I know it's popped off. I got an

[00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:07.410]
agent. My name, JLHM. JLHM. Listen, I just moved here from, moved back here from Gain. Now, wait,

[00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:10.710]
wait a minute. Wait a minute. What are you shaking your head about now? He hasn't said a word about

[00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:14.670]
sports. I didn't say I'm not saying anything. Is there anything that you're going to be pleased with?

[00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:18.730]
I didn't say a word. When it comes back with your lunch, then you'll be then it'll be pacified. See,

[00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:21.970]
he's getting a little surly because yet we haven't had all the food in here. I'm on his diet.

[00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:26.210]
Oh, no. We haven't had all this food and now he's getting a little bit better. Don't listen to

[00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:31.090]
this man. You're doing right. I'm just waiting for the point. This is what happens with these guys,

[00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:34.970]
man. You spoil them right. They get used to being treated like royalty and all of a sudden, man,

[00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:40.430]
to get, you know, you go ahead. Everything's just fine. I need to ask you a question here.

[00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:45.530]
For about three weeks, I've been now listening. I was turned on by a friend here and I know you don't

[00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:50.250]
like the old part and the Canadians. But what exactly is it you don't like about the Canadians?

[00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:54.370]
The French Canadians. Oh, excuse me. Oh, yeah. The French Canadians. The other ones are okay. The

[00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:57.990]
French Canadians come down here and they're the words they don't tip at all. They live like a dime on

[00:57:57.990 --> 00:58:03.370]
an $80 bill and they drive about 15 miles an hour in reverse and they're just, you know,

[00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:06.990]
they just generally destroy the whole area when they come down. They ruin it for everybody else.

[00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:13.390]
We were watching the dolphin game last night at a sports bar and the fertility was included and

[00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:17.910]
that's what spurred the conversation. Yeah, but you had a lot of French Canadians. If the tip is

[00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:22.930]
included, man, they'll be there, especially if there's 40% off. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What was it? You

[00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:27.010]
said this morning about Jewish shun. I missed the beginning of the show. No, no. Somebody called in

[00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:30.830]
some young kid as a matter of fact. He must have been nine or ten years old or 12 or whatever he was.

[00:58:30.830 --> 00:58:35.750]
And he said his name was John and then he was asking me about the grease man and all these Yiddish

[00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:41.150]
stuff that he plays up there in Washington, which I wasn't aware of. And after I hung up,

[00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:45.150]
I realized that this kid, basically, said happy Shavuahs or something was Jewish and his name was

[00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:50.470]
John. Okay. I just made the point that John is not usually a Jewish name. That's all it's nothing

[00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:54.490]
that we have to, you know, bring in the ass or air a fat, have a conference about or, you know,

[00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:59.250]
Monachem Begin or anything like that. It just was an observation. I could be wrong. We could

[00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:03.110]
wind up with 50,000 Jewish Johns out there before the end of that. I kind of doubt it though.

[00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:07.970]
Okay. What do I remember those great, like John Ben Gurion and John Begin.

[00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:12.510]
That's it. That's all I'm sure that John Lapidas and John Lipschitz.

[00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:18.290]
I know him. Yeah, I bet you do. Yeah. From the Bronx, right? I've been listening to about three

[00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:22.830]
weeks and now I'm listening in my house. Well, there you go, sir. You're an addict. You can't turn

[00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:26.470]
it off. Okay. So it's nothing I should be worried about. Oh, no. Something you ought to be

[00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:32.670]
excited about. Okay, Mr. Rogers and Mr. Duck have a good one. You too. Okay. If I can find one,

[00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:39.150]
I certainly will. It's 1144, 16 till noon on a show that is moving along at a breathtaking pace.

[00:59:39.310 --> 00:59:43.710]
And it has been star studded. Star studded. We've had celebrities. We've had would-be celebrities.

[00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:48.610]
We had former celebrities. We haven't had Lee Fowler though. True. But we do have Greg in Port St.

[00:59:48.730 --> 00:59:53.810]
Lucy on the Lee Fowler line. How you doing, Greg? How you doing, Neil? How you doing, everybody? How you doing,

[00:59:53.810 --> 01:00:00.210]
Mr. Duck? Greg is putting on his best off Florida radio voice. I like this. What time is your show on,

[01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:06.950]
Greg? Well, we have to cancel for today. No, there are a lot of shows in town like that, including one

[01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:12.410]
on the station we used to work. Probably guys doing over there. Great. Are we really, let's see,

[01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:17.210]
Port St. Lucy? That's not too far from Sebastian, I bet. Yeah, we're pretty close. You don't know

[01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:21.650]
that guy that writes me those letters, do you? He writes your letters. Hate letters from Sebastian.

[01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:26.370]
Yeah, they hate us in Sebastian. Those born again Christians are going to come down and rip off

[01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:31.990]
our faces until we accept the Lord. You know, that kind of stuff. Who needs them? So I heard

[01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:37.190]
South Beach is getting developed now. It's Penrods there. Penrods is there. It is open. They're

[01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:41.910]
got a long way to go to finish it, but they're building a gigantic, expensive, multi-million-dollar

[01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:46.930]
Penrods on South Beach. That's great, because we've got down the four-load of the Ellen. Forget about

[01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:51.010]
that, sir. Bob Cox is standing at the city line and he will, if you're under the age of a 100 man,

[01:00:51.010 --> 01:00:59.590]
he will not let you in. Now we got a call, says the grease man is Lutheran. He's a little bit

[01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:03.590]
everything, okay? He's bi-religious. And he's got a filthy mouth to top it all off.

[01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:09.310]
So what is the deal with Port Laudersale? Because Sebastian came down there, it's pretty dead.

[01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:13.850]
Dead is the operative word. You took it out of my mouth, sir. It is dead. The patient has been

[01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:18.970]
declared the deceased. What a shame. Yep. Used to be a great swing in place, great time,

[01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:22.450]
a lot of young living and breathing people. Now the only young people they got left are the

[01:01:22.450 --> 01:01:26.590]
drugies out there in the streets. That's about it. What is the mayor trying to do, making it through

[01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:31.490]
retirement? Yeah, you got it. Outdoor funeral parlour, sir. It's the number one business in his town.

[01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:36.390]
So dying business. It's inside thing to shut the hotel down, or? Yeah, we're going to tear him down.

[01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:40.590]
We're going to make him condo like they did on Miami Beach. That was the worst when they started

[01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:44.890]
with the first condo on Miami Beach. That was the kiss of death, okay? And that's what's going to

[01:01:44.890 --> 01:01:48.930]
happen in Fort Lauderdale now. Wonderful. In fact, you know that hotel, the Yankee Clipper?

[01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:56.030]
It may before long become the Yankee Shlepper. Well, listen, it's great hearing from you. I know

[01:01:56.030 --> 01:02:01.650]
you're just astonished by this, but welcome to a unreal place, okay? Yeah, come down and see

[01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:05.810]
us. Okay, have a good one. All right. Bring your friend from Sebastian too. All right, take care, God.

[01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:12.470]
Bye-bye. Well, we get calls from all over. Yeah. God's-A-Know-Me from Pawoki and we like

[01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:17.770]
Fort St. Lucy and Viral Beach, Jensen Beach, places that I'm not really quite sure where they are.

[01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:25.310]
Air Force Beach. Air Force Beach in the West Palm Beach until the little old ladies used to

[01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:29.950]
stand up on the chairs with their binoculars. That's disgusting down there. Put a stop to it. It's

[01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:34.350]
disgusting. And then they used to get telescope. And that one they saw Lee Fowler on Air Force Beach.

[01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:39.150]
That's when they closed it down. They said this is going a little bit too far. Okay. Lee in the

[01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:42.970]
raw. I'm telling you, man, I don't know what's going on at Palm Beach Line. Is that for

[01:02:42.970 --> 01:02:46.630]
Plucky? It's going crazy, but I just have a feeling he may shine us, you know what I'm saying?

[01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:51.550]
He may. Would that be something if he shines us? Maybe today. So what's the story? We are maybe

[01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:55.230]
Lee could take a poll today. And what does what does this thing is the grease man? Jewish or Lutheran?

[01:02:55.250 --> 01:03:00.490]
Bad, crazy. There you go, Lee. Baby, you got your show now. Glad to do it for you. Oh, that's not

[01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:06.010]
him, huh? Well, every time I see that Palm Beach Line, I think just maybe, maybe it's the,

[01:03:06.590 --> 01:03:10.750]
the thing that I don't understand is the only time we can get him on any more Steve has to come in

[01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:14.230]
here and call him on a fat live. You notice that? That little little stick that what does he

[01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:18.430]
have to do? Get Steve's permission before he calls the show? Is that apparently there's this

[01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:24.070]
incestuous then he had Nadine, the space queen or whatever she is on. Incredible. Incredible.

[01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:28.970]
Unbelievable. We've got a penrod spy report. See the problem is fact I got a letter about that

[01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:33.230]
this morning about somebody gets very upset because we keep taking the mobile and the Palm Beach

[01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:37.190]
line callers and everybody else has to wait till they become like Methuselow, okay?

[01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:41.510]
True. And they're getting sick and tired of that, right? Next is yet. I can't stand it.

[01:03:42.850 --> 01:03:46.610]
So from now on, if you call on a mobile phone, we'll make you wait till a year from Sookas to put

[01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:52.670]
you on, okay? I like it. A little residual there from Bellsoft Mobility or something. It's 1148

[01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:56.210]

the most chronic

[01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:15.150]
guess in the history of radio talk okay

[01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:19.250]
a man who was sent me over the years probably five hundred letters inviting

[01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:19.730]
himself

[01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:22.790]
on my show each invitation has been turned down

sure good luck to you sir mm-hmm I'll stay in the station till they win a game

[01:15:59.490 --> 01:16:03.950]
well good now that's a suggestion no chance yeah that's a real suggestion

[01:16:04.530 --> 01:16:09.370]
that you want to go for that huh no now we don't have a shower here right then you know I like to

[01:16:09.370 --> 01:16:14.210]
not to be I like the game but I don't want to be too gamey you know what I mean uh one more

[01:16:14.210 --> 01:16:21.590]
question for you yep uh back in July when you're on another station and uh when the bird would do

[01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:28.390]
the you mean on invisible zeta yeah when the bird would do the news then right after the news you

[01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:34.130]
uh run down the baseball score if I told you how much I enjoyed it with him at doing the news now

[01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:39.270]
you want to run down the scores for baseball scores yeah yeah you still don't do that every day

[01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:44.950]
because I don't use just a physical reason you know oh yeah we'll do it okay have no fear pal

[01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:51.370]
all right thanks boy boy bye okay great now you got to really you've got to make a new user

[01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:59.190]
resolution to be a little less surly about sports okay yeah I've never in my that wasn't like

[01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:04.090]
I don't think so that was like no that was adamant that was a Sherman-esque statement absolutely

[01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:09.450]
as an Alan Sherman I have never ever in my life heard so much talk about any game I don't think

[01:17:09.450 --> 01:17:13.970]
as I've heard today and yesterday about this game we've hardly talked about the game I've won

[01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:18.770]
her two cards I'm talking about us no I mean on the rest of the state well of course because the

[01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:24.710]
mic is a lifelong brown span and also with dolphin span so he had in the mystery picker is a brown

[01:17:24.710 --> 01:17:29.730]
span and I don't want to you know reveal her identity but and then of course sunny a sports

[01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:34.290]
intensive so this is a sports station don't you understand that it actually what do you think

[01:17:34.290 --> 01:17:37.610]
all those jocks straps are lined up in the hall out there you think those are for management people

[01:17:39.690 --> 01:17:44.530]
huh it actually sounds if you're in when we came into this building they were playing ed aims in

[01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:50.110]
my cup run of over okay you'd actually think it was an important game it was for the brown

[01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:54.790]
and the dolphins stuck it to him and he figured misery loves company I

[01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:58.570]
the browns had a chance for the playoffs and the dolphins saw to it that they can stick it

[01:17:58.570 --> 01:18:04.030]
where the moon don't shine okay and they'll love it okay and she will have had that confused look

[01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:08.610]
on his face there kept looking around like what the hell is going on here especially when we're

[01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:12.830]
basically missing those field goals early in the game and don said what the hell is a story here

[01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:18.950]
Hank and Hank was saying what the hell is a story Rick and Rick was saying let's get this thing

[01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:24.070]
over with already okay all right it's 12 minutes past noon and you heard what this man

[01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:31.390]
you did great okay you did just fine good yeah and you beat WOLD by a very wide now see again

[01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:37.230]
in 12 plus they beat you by what was it a four three two four one four three two four one

[01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:45.230]
but in this one their demographics are so old that even in 35 no seriously 35 to 64 this station

[01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:50.850]
beat the daylight out of them so all the overwhelming audience is over 65 over there I mean just

[01:18:50.850 --> 01:18:54.410]
ancient and I said they better hurry up and make some hay with it because they're all going to be

[01:18:54.410 --> 01:19:00.150]
dead before you know before they can sell a trend and of course they did it real well

[01:19:01.210 --> 01:19:06.190]
they've turned the corners man you talk about taking in an immediate dive I mean dropping like a

[01:19:06.190 --> 01:19:13.590]
giant rock from the Empire State Building okay yeah yeah a month from now and even in midday

[01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:16.930]
here we actually showed a little tickle in there we were only here a week and a half but went from

[01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:22.550]
a three one to a three seven so we're already moving there's a little movement by the way

[01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:28.910]
I loved I loved your anti pet lady yesterday by the way oh god and what is Sam silver doing on

[01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:36.070]
the leaf falafel and Sam silver I will you not only boring but just chronic man chronic and

[01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:40.710]
fight himself on your constantly is a pompous rabbi we would like to speak to mr.

[01:19:40.810 --> 01:19:47.790]
Fowler is that possible he won't call man what he's not going to call he is going to call

[01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:56.230]
me not this week oh well if I just had Nadine the space queen on and rabbi silver today discussing who

[01:19:56.230 --> 01:20:01.370]
is a Jew and ripping off all of Steve's guests I wouldn't call this week either he has a good

[01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:05.050]
reason I'll tell you off the air because you probably don't want to mention on the air but really

[01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:14.930]
really something sinister no no no no respect oh okay oh I see well I don't think one thing has

[01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:20.210]
anything to do with the other one okay that's a good excuse all right next week he gives you

[01:20:20.210 --> 01:20:27.170]
a friend just came out they ought to be depressed this is the beginning of the end I guess yeah

[01:20:27.170 --> 01:20:31.010]
something like that but anyway you're going to enjoy those polkas man there's a market for that

[01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:37.950]
Frankie Ankevick and that's the well sound good on AM what is it all right for lottery

[01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:47.050]
of psychotic Susan up and for lottery I'll do never listen to the radio she hate you too I don't

[01:20:47.050 --> 01:20:51.230]
know I haven't ready I just don't let me look at it let me just take a peek there's no money in

[01:20:51.230 --> 01:20:57.850]
there or anything don't by the way you see sunny fox on a way in with his check that's right I

[01:20:57.850 --> 01:21:04.330]
got mine right in here now it's two firm Susan is that two for the price of one how much effort

[01:21:04.330 --> 01:21:10.050]
does it take this man is so I don't don't be free you know I never dreamed back in the old days

[01:21:10.050 --> 01:21:13.850]
when mr fatmouth worked over at that other station when he would literally rip you from one

[01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:17.770]
into the radio band of the other and ever dreamed I'd be writing new steed can is the last resort

[01:21:17.770 --> 01:21:24.470]
he had me hating you back then here's the situation I think neo roger's bites it I told him

[01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:27.910]
to go in a recent letter but he was too cowardly to read it ripped it up right on the air which

[01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:31.810]
doesn't surprise me because his whole show is a ripoff and all he knows how to do is rip people

[01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:37.410]
especially successful ones he's a ripoff artist neo the ripper now he's calling Debbie Ellis fat

[01:21:37.410 --> 01:21:41.750]
on the air amazing neo roger's calling Debbie Ellis fat is like Danny DeVito calling Michael

[01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:48.290]
Jay Fox short by the way I happen to know Debbie his comments anger me personally I start thinking

[01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:53.670]
nasty things involving physical humiliation I'd like to see him end up as a contrived controversy

[01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:59.970]
on the Steve Keynes show is there such a word as cajonless what a cajonless douche bag that neo rogers

[01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:05.210]
is getting my gets my letter and rips it up rip and run radio neo roger style neo you're a used

[01:22:05.210 --> 01:22:11.030]
douche bag sorry I had to use up your airtime and interrupt what normally would be an interesting

[01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:15.230]
entertaining program with all this nonsense but I had no other choice where else could I go now

[01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:21.370]
that neo has no balls with apologies Susan Martin in Fort Lauderdale Susan is another one of those

[01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:26.630]
like a wacko cases manager just a Ken turn this show off yes he heard in the register yeah you heard

[01:22:31.190 --> 01:22:36.790]
you know thrown so that when she's pretending to be royalty and she must spend a lot of time on

[01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:40.690]
the throne okay that because you know what everything we do on the show thank you Susan we love you

lawyers association okay Miami hello yeah yeah come on sir Susan would be very upset to hear

[01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:10.550]
you ask such a question yeah listen I just wanted to say that Rick Stiderman is the antichrist okay

[01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:15.050]
okay yeah and also I wanted to know if you could play the Michael Jackson commercial for me

[01:23:15.570 --> 01:23:19.990]
the Michael Jackson thing yeah Michael Jackson Globe commercial I'm an destiny for it

[01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:25.170]
sounds like a request for the Michael Jackson glove to me is that what this was sir

[01:23:25.170 --> 01:23:29.770]
yes now you know there's no request on the show but just because you're a great guy sir

encounter with an unfamiliar queen I urge you to do like I do go it alone but make sure you wear

[01:23:57.890 --> 01:24:03.930]
protection that's why I recommend the Michael Jackson glove worn on either hand the Michael Jackson

[01:24:03.930 --> 01:24:09.890]
glove adds the security and peace of mind that I need to do it myself so remember before you

[01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:17.890]
put it out put it on and the Michael Jackson glove proving once again that a bird in the hand is

[01:24:17.890 --> 01:24:22.450]

[01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:33.450]
have you tinkered with it i'm talking about this overhead speaker is it lower it's not as loud as it

[01:29:33.450 --> 01:29:39.350]
was is it a volume control if you got the volume control in there no it's just on or i'll have to

[01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:43.230]
go on below somewhere they must they must have tinkered with it turned it down a little bit because i

[01:29:43.230 --> 01:29:48.590]
like it loud because otherwise it doesn't serve any purpose okay move it right along i know the

[01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:38.950]
confirm a few things one is i'm talking to a friend of mine i've told off here and as you know

[01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:45.170]
bricked at wca you that is correct told me besides doing his talk show there he replaced al meltser

[01:44:45.170 --> 01:44:49.990]
i was having a hard time believing that but is that true you haven't heard that i don't have any

[01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:57.550]
idea because that sounded pretty bizarre well first of all who is al meltser al meltser is all good

[01:44:57.550 --> 01:45:03.650]
on all that's not al meltser for an art meltser no al meltser does these sports at wca you know

[01:45:03.650 --> 01:45:10.530]
no chance no what alin knows about sports no chance so he didn't replace them and second question is

[01:45:10.530 --> 01:45:15.810]
um well we don't really know okay second question is that i was told that um

circus town up there because they they have this uh i don't know if you heard about it but they

[01:46:41.130 --> 01:46:48.250]

[01:46:48.250 --> 01:46:52.950]
the person who could toss in the part of it and i understand that bob mayor is going to be going

[01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:57.930]
up there for two more years yeah well we got they got some guys out there so anyway uh

[01:46:58.630 --> 01:47:05.750]
can we show him some short sub-oh well anyway i also have to say that uh i agree with uh

[01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:11.790]
grand on the sports thing i mean i enjoyed playing sports but just just kind of watching him

[01:47:11.790 --> 01:47:19.110]
it it gets pretty boring i'm a mazer by guys who spend like seven hours on a sunday watching

[01:47:19.110 --> 01:47:25.210]
two now listen let me let me quote great great man of god jimmy swagger who said that sometimes

[01:47:25.210 --> 01:47:31.410]
watching is almost as good as participating i don't agree well in some cases but uh yeah i know i

[01:47:31.410 --> 01:47:37.430]
have a couple of roommates that uh that you know go to school up in and just have tons and tons of work

[01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:43.570]
and they just spend like like eighteen hours sunday from sunday to sunday just plastered in front of

[01:47:43.570 --> 01:47:47.990]
that well first of all years ago now i'm a big sports fan don't get me wrong years ago i used to

[01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:52.150]
get into that kind of thing when when it was quality but now the national football league is so

[01:47:52.150 --> 01:47:57.130]
diluted with mediocrity see people keep bitching about the dolphins or this specific team it's not a

[01:47:57.130 --> 01:48:03.430]
specific team the league the quality of play uh you know expansion is caused this tremendous dilution

[01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:08.030]
of talent in all sports and it's diminished to such mediocrity now that basically what you've got

[01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:12.330]
is a mediocre sport so to be able to sit there and watch it for six seven eight hours you've really

[01:48:12.330 --> 01:48:17.510]
got to be desperate yeah no doubt you have to have no life at all reminds me of during the strike

[01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:21.710]
when some people actually were watching tape game yeah oh yeah i remember that and watching those

[01:48:21.710 --> 01:48:26.210]
scams sunday afternoon yeah at least the mystery picker was picking scabs not watching

[01:48:26.210 --> 01:48:30.090]

[01:48:41.630 --> 01:48:47.750]

[01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:52.410]
out you can share it out you will do spag you will do spag you will do spag you will do spag

[01:48:52.410 --> 01:48:58.490]
57 degrees is just beyond believable and even the slim rich over here has said that it is brutal

[01:48:58.490 --> 01:49:04.170]
out there it is just absolutely can't believe unbelievable i'm sorry Jay we had to say it

[01:49:19.610 --> 01:49:24.230]
there to stay but i just um wouldn't be really dismayed if we were disappointed i don't think

[01:49:24.230 --> 01:49:29.490]

[01:49:45.770 --> 01:49:51.870]

[01:49:51.870 --> 01:49:58.450]
contact tyquan doe stuff like that my opinion of it well see i have a different opinion sir about

[01:49:58.450 --> 01:50:04.250]
actually participating in a sport and passively watching a sport i think they're very separate

[01:50:04.250 --> 01:50:11.630]
things so if you're participating in it and doing it i think that's like uh whatever it is i think

[01:50:11.630 --> 01:50:15.550]
it's probably good for you know it sounds like you're like almost accomplishing something you know

[01:50:15.550 --> 01:50:21.790]
what i mean well have you ever seen did you watch the judo the uh the uh the judo competition

[01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:27.750]
is definitely boring no i did not watch it now very boring but years and years and years ago i did

[01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:34.170]
that for exercise like 15 18 years ago i used to do judo and karate for exercise purposes

[01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:40.430]
well would you would you consider that a sport or hmm i just not what lee has gone on tomorrow that

[01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:48.390]
rabbi who does judo i guess it's a sport yeah what else would you call it well it you know it is

[01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:53.670]
judo sport but yeah um but i'm not not for spectator i mean boring with the boring

[01:50:53.670 --> 01:50:59.910]
spectators i would think so you wouldn't well would you condemn people for participating in sports

[01:50:59.910 --> 01:51:06.550]
where they might you know get bashed in the face no i don't want to condemn people sure you do

[01:51:07.290 --> 01:51:10.430]
because like it's only me you don't want to you just got through doing it in the last hour

[01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:14.570]
condemning people to watch football that's what they want to do that's their business it's just

[01:51:14.570 --> 01:51:18.210]
you're condemning them you're being judged by you're like one of those right wing board again

[01:51:18.210 --> 01:51:22.930]
douche bag it seems like a waste of time to me well that's your opinion if you're participating in it i

[01:51:22.930 --> 01:51:28.930]
think you know what uh what's at risk and i think you know you're aware when you go into it so no

[01:51:28.930 --> 01:51:34.290]
i would not condemn people well one thing though at least it's good for self defense if you know

[01:51:34.290 --> 01:51:38.510]

a

[02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:14.550]
at WIOD, the home of sanity and an otherwise insane place, right?

[02:05:14.850 --> 02:05:15.630]
What an hour is it?

[02:05:15.790 --> 02:05:16.430]
It certainly is.

[02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:17.170]
I'll hear to prove it.

[02:05:17.230 --> 02:05:17.850]
Talk about insanity.

[02:05:17.950 --> 02:05:20.310]
Speaking of sane, let's go to beautiful West Palm Beach.

[02:05:20.510 --> 02:05:20.890]
I don't know, Neil.

[02:05:21.210 --> 02:05:21.370]
Yeah.

[02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:21.850]
How's it going?

[02:05:22.150 --> 02:05:22.390]
Great.

[02:05:22.670 --> 02:05:24.390]
I just turned on, I just turned you on today.

[02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:26.790]
I don't know if I'm giving you all information to hear that

[02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:28.130]
with leaf-out is yesterday.

[02:05:28.430 --> 02:05:29.950]
Not the show we did, but at the end.

[02:05:30.810 --> 02:05:31.030]
No.

[02:05:31.490 --> 02:05:33.850]
Well, the RFC, he can't idea if someone was in a way that was

[02:05:33.850 --> 02:05:36.830]
contrived to bathe and he said, it was a yellow and yellow

[02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:37.230]
in his community.

[02:05:37.230 --> 02:05:39.010]
So that was a pretty ponderous hour.

[02:05:39.770 --> 02:05:40.570]
Oh, no.

[02:05:40.830 --> 02:05:41.750]
Lee, baby.

[02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:43.650]
No wonder he's ashamed to call us, OK?

[02:05:44.210 --> 02:05:44.690]
That's embarrassing.

[02:05:45.010 --> 02:05:45.650]
That was part of it.

[02:05:45.670 --> 02:05:45.990]
Hey, Berg.

[02:05:46.210 --> 02:05:46.630]
Yes, sir.

[02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:47.630]
Where'd he go off?

[02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:49.650]
No, I just...

[02:05:49.650 --> 02:05:53.950]
I want to tell you, even body and Clyde, never stole as much as Fowler has in

[02:05:53.950 --> 02:05:56.310]
last, I don't know, a few months, incredible.

[02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:57.010]
It's terrible.

[02:05:57.210 --> 02:06:00.390]
I don't listen to what I just was slipping through and I heard it while yelling

[02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:02.250]
and screaming, so I figured I'd listen for a little bit.

[02:06:02.650 --> 02:06:04.030]
Yeah, that'll generally do it.

[02:06:04.530 --> 02:06:06.470]
And that's before his guest got here.

[02:06:07.050 --> 02:06:08.050]
Please always yelling.

[02:06:08.530 --> 02:06:09.090]
Is he?

[02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:10.410]
Well, listen, have a great day.

[02:06:10.630 --> 02:06:11.510]
All right, thanks for all.

[02:06:11.650 --> 02:06:11.830]
Bye.

[02:06:12.070 --> 02:06:12.390]
Take it any.

[02:06:13.630 --> 02:06:14.710]
130 at WIOD.

[02:06:14.810 --> 02:06:18.250]
If you're not familiar with the WJNO primal yell, tune in to Lee Fowler.

[02:06:19.730 --> 02:06:21.030]
Man, there's something there, isn't there?

[02:06:21.430 --> 02:06:22.430]
Talk about a screamer.

[02:06:22.910 --> 02:06:24.810]
And we've had a lot of screamers on the phone today.

[02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:25.890]
Believe me, let's go to Miami.

[02:06:26.130 --> 02:06:26.310]
Hello.

[02:06:26.590 --> 02:06:27.250]
Hey, how you doing?

[02:06:27.390 --> 02:06:28.170]
Just terrific.

[02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:30.750]
Are you real or a make-believe, sir?

[02:06:31.090 --> 02:06:31.490]
I'm sorry.

[02:06:31.770 --> 02:06:33.150]
Are you for real or make-believe?

[02:06:33.290 --> 02:06:34.270]
I'm definitely for real.

[02:06:34.270 --> 02:06:36.390]
A couple things.

[02:06:36.610 --> 02:06:37.650]
Bird, number one.

[02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:39.170]
No, no, no.

[02:06:39.490 --> 02:06:41.830]
I saw Terry Merrimon at the heat game.

[02:06:42.070 --> 02:06:42.410]
You did?

[02:06:42.650 --> 02:06:42.850]
Yeah.

[02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:43.270]
Wait a minute.

[02:06:43.370 --> 02:06:44.830]
You saw Terry Merrimon in heat?

[02:06:45.250 --> 02:06:46.250]
Well, that too.

[02:06:47.190 --> 02:06:48.070]
How was she?

[02:06:48.430 --> 02:06:50.250]
Well, she was sucking down a few cocktails.

[02:06:50.750 --> 02:06:51.710]
I am, I'm on.

[02:06:51.870 --> 02:06:53.070]
I'm being serious, too.

[02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:56.910]
It was right before her special because I saw the news that night.

[02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:59.850]
I'm a rerun right on the married to the bad.

[02:07:00.150 --> 02:07:02.670]
She was on set that night.

[02:07:03.230 --> 02:07:07.370]
I'm saying she was on set with Ann Bishop and right before that.

[02:07:07.810 --> 02:07:09.730]
I don't know if it was Ginger L or not.

[02:07:10.170 --> 02:07:10.170]

[02:07:10.590 --> 02:07:11.610]
At the game, she was...

[02:07:11.610 --> 02:07:12.910]
Maybe a little dietary, sir.

[02:07:13.230 --> 02:07:13.730]
Yeah, right.

[02:07:15.150 --> 02:07:16.990]
But the guy said he saw...

[02:07:16.990 --> 02:07:18.190]
She's not bad.

[02:07:18.330 --> 02:07:18.910]
Looking at all.

[02:07:19.050 --> 02:07:19.950]
She's not at all.

[02:07:20.510 --> 02:07:22.190]
No, I don't think she's bad looking, but what they did.

[02:07:22.190 --> 02:07:23.690]
Did you see her on the news last night?

[02:07:24.010 --> 02:07:24.590]
No, I didn't.

[02:07:24.690 --> 02:07:25.330]
They have cut her.

[02:07:25.690 --> 02:07:27.170]
It's like, you remember the scene at movie?

[02:07:28.330 --> 02:07:30.410]
That was then, and this is now with Emilio Estabés.

[02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:30.830]

[02:07:31.290 --> 02:07:32.030]
And Frank Sheffer.

[02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:35.570]
Well, anyway, there's a scene where they all get drunk and they take assizzards

[02:07:35.570 --> 02:07:37.250]
and they cut this girl's hair all off.

[02:07:37.390 --> 02:07:37.590]
That's right.

[02:07:37.690 --> 02:07:40.330]
And that's what it looked like they did the portary last night on the newsman.

[02:07:40.450 --> 02:07:43.070]
I mean, her hair is like all on the cutting room floor somewhere.

[02:07:44.610 --> 02:07:44.970]
Exactly.

[02:07:45.310 --> 02:07:48.950]
Those people at Channel 10, I think Brian Norcross is arranging the hairdos.

[02:07:49.110 --> 02:07:49.510]
I really do.

[02:07:49.630 --> 02:07:50.670]
I don't know, either here.

[02:07:50.930 --> 02:07:51.770]
Or the little guy.

[02:07:51.850 --> 02:07:55.330]
Either that or they got Walt Kronai's doing what the shaky dumb is doing in haircuts.

[02:07:55.470 --> 02:07:57.010]
What about... what about a massing gal?

[02:07:57.790 --> 02:07:58.590]
What about him?

[02:07:58.770 --> 02:07:59.250]
Well, come on.

[02:07:59.270 --> 02:08:00.450]
I know. He's a real douche.

[02:08:01.570 --> 02:08:03.010]
No, but he's pretty hot.

[02:08:03.110 --> 02:08:03.770]
She got some hits.

[02:08:04.090 --> 02:08:04.290]
But I...

[02:08:04.290 --> 02:08:04.950]
Who massing gal?

[02:08:07.290 --> 02:08:08.350]
No, no, no.

[02:08:09.150 --> 02:08:10.990]
Also, one of a couple of things.

[02:08:11.690 --> 02:08:14.990]
Did you see after, on 60 minutes, uh...

[02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.890]
Yeah, the hang-in judge.

[02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.790]
Yeah.

[02:08:17.970 --> 02:08:19.770]
And she was on...

[02:08:19.770 --> 02:08:21.230]
How come she wasn't on Steve's show?

[02:08:21.930 --> 02:08:23.850]
Well, he doesn't have those chronic guests on anymore.

[02:08:23.850 --> 02:08:25.410]
He has original different people on.

[02:08:25.970 --> 02:08:27.630]
Like Bob Furnstin and Rick Ciderman.

[02:08:27.850 --> 02:08:29.190]
You're not just front and forward, am I?

[02:08:29.190 --> 02:08:30.190]
No, it's just a joke.

[02:08:30.330 --> 02:08:31.210]
Didn't you hear what I just said?

[02:08:31.250 --> 02:08:32.070]
Yeah, Rick Ciderman.

[02:08:32.070 --> 02:08:33.950]
And Alex Rubin and all his original guests.

[02:08:34.050 --> 02:08:34.730]
Every other day.

[02:08:35.850 --> 02:08:36.490]
And, uh...

[02:08:36.490 --> 02:08:37.410]
Well, Alan...

[02:08:37.410 --> 02:08:38.070]
Alan is busy.

[02:08:38.130 --> 02:08:39.590]
The hang-in judge is busy riding that bike.

[02:08:39.870 --> 02:08:40.430]
Yeah, right.

[02:08:41.330 --> 02:08:43.630]
Hey, Bird, I know why they don't let you do the news.

[02:08:44.210 --> 02:08:44.990]
And why is that, sir?

[02:08:45.450 --> 02:08:47.410]
Well, because he used to make so many errors.

[02:08:47.790 --> 02:08:49.270]
And he didn't pre-read his material.

[02:08:50.410 --> 02:08:51.050]
On, uh...

[02:08:51.050 --> 02:08:53.590]
You know, I have that bird bit where he messes up all the time.

[02:08:53.690 --> 02:08:53.830]
Yeah.

[02:08:54.110 --> 02:08:55.990]
And this is a hardcore news show.

[02:08:56.090 --> 02:08:57.610]
Well, that's perfect for our audience, sir.

[02:08:57.610 --> 02:08:58.690]
Yeah, right, exactly.

[02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:59.370]
Doug Ketchon.

[02:08:59.510 --> 02:09:00.990]
Doug Ketchon, after we've been here long enough.

[02:09:01.150 --> 02:09:02.990]
I think you ought to do something from the tab, Lord.

[02:09:03.130 --> 02:09:03.670]
That was great.

[02:09:03.890 --> 02:09:04.590]
That's very serious.

[02:09:04.590 --> 02:09:04.590]

[02:09:04.630 --> 02:09:05.250]
We'll bring it back.

[02:09:05.550 --> 02:09:05.910]
Oh, great.

[02:09:06.230 --> 02:09:07.890]
I have one other thing about the ratings.

[02:09:08.130 --> 02:09:08.290]
Yeah.

[02:09:08.650 --> 02:09:10.330]
And I don't mean to take up too much time.

[02:09:10.810 --> 02:09:14.610]
Do they have a section for, like, the overnight DJs?

[02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:16.430]
Where who has the big share?

[02:09:16.710 --> 02:09:16.890]
No.

[02:09:17.210 --> 02:09:17.890]
They don't do that during the day.

[02:09:17.890 --> 02:09:18.710]
Not after mid-autumn at all.

[02:09:19.010 --> 02:09:19.130]
No.

[02:09:19.630 --> 02:09:21.370]
I mean, there is such a thing, but we don't get it.

[02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:22.230]
Oh.

[02:09:22.510 --> 02:09:23.670]
Okay, but there is...

[02:09:23.670 --> 02:09:25.150]
You can get it if you're desperate.

[02:09:25.150 --> 02:09:27.910]
But there are so few people listening overnight that it's not worth, you know.

[02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.690]
I see.

[02:09:28.730 --> 02:09:29.490]
I was just curious.

[02:09:30.110 --> 02:09:31.150]
I was wondering...

[02:09:31.690 --> 02:09:32.210]
In closing.

[02:09:32.430 --> 02:09:33.250]
Yeah, in closing.

[02:09:33.710 --> 02:09:36.350]
I was wondering if you could pray that...

[02:09:36.350 --> 02:09:38.150]
That song and Harry Bitt about...

[02:09:38.890 --> 02:09:39.690]
Jewish Polkinoes.

[02:09:39.710 --> 02:09:40.150]
I was really...

[02:09:40.730 --> 02:09:41.790]
Coming up right after the news.

[02:09:41.930 --> 02:09:42.390]
Are you serious?

[02:09:42.610 --> 02:09:44.150]
Well, it just dawned on me, yeah.

[02:09:44.410 --> 02:09:44.730]
Great.

[02:09:44.890 --> 02:09:45.470]
Have a good one.

[02:09:45.730 --> 02:09:46.690]
Say goodbye.

[02:09:47.110 --> 02:09:47.270]
Bye.

[02:09:47.970 --> 02:09:49.050]
134 at WIOD.

[02:09:49.090 --> 02:09:52.410]
Let's tell you about the brick-oven pizza rear, as Ernie would say.

[02:09:52.410 --> 02:09:54.970]
No matter what you call it, the pizza is sensational.

[02:09:55.170 --> 02:09:59.090]
The people who read Soundflow to magazine have voted at the best pizza in Soundflow to two years in a row.

[02:09:59.270 --> 02:10:00.230]
It is unique.

[02:10:00.430 --> 02:10:01.150]
It is totally different.

[02:10:01.390 --> 02:10:05.910]
Small, personal-sized pizzas cooked in those wood-burting brick-ovens in just three minutes.

[02:10:06.050 --> 02:10:10.270]
It's not one of those places you order your pizza and then you read war in peace before it comes to the table, man.

[02:10:10.330 --> 02:10:13.470]
In just three minutes, they will have it to your hot and delicious, just the way you like it.

[02:10:13.730 --> 02:10:16.970]
With any of the toppings you like, or just the cheese and tomatoes, which is fantastic.

[02:10:17.530 --> 02:10:19.670]
And of course, all kinds of great calzones and sandwiches.

[02:10:20.010 --> 02:10:21.430]
The garlic slices are out of this world.

[02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:23.590]
They're big zine and spaghetti are fantastic.

[02:10:23.590 --> 02:10:28.510]
And if you're out of diet, they've even got great antipostas and other salads at the brick-oven.

[02:10:28.750 --> 02:10:30.010]
And when you stop by, you might be out.

[02:10:30.190 --> 02:10:31.610]
Right, another 500 and bring it in tomorrow.

[02:10:32.290 --> 02:10:33.010]
Yeah, right.

[02:10:33.170 --> 02:10:34.470]
You have your checkbook video here.

[02:10:34.750 --> 02:10:36.470]
I don't usually bring my checkbook in.

[02:10:36.550 --> 02:10:39.210]
Sonny, are you that insecure that you bring your checkbook to work with?

[02:10:39.710 --> 02:10:40.190]
That's great.

[02:10:40.350 --> 02:10:41.030]
Thank you very much.

[02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.970]
It really is a thousand.

[02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.690]
How do you like that?

[02:10:42.990 --> 02:10:43.350]
Incredible.

[02:10:43.530 --> 02:10:44.230]
I'll be damned.

[02:10:44.590 --> 02:10:45.130]
That way, to my mind.

[02:10:45.250 --> 02:10:46.850]
Let's take a little and ask you a question.

[02:10:46.850 --> 02:10:47.670]
Hermitemic beaner.

[02:10:47.690 --> 02:10:48.710]
I'm going to be really clean that out.

[02:10:48.790 --> 02:10:50.050]
But they didn't give me a dime yet.

[02:10:50.330 --> 02:10:52.150]
So, how do you hear him better than you can, you?

[02:10:52.190 --> 02:10:53.410]
He's like closer to the microphone.

[02:10:54.010 --> 02:10:54.710]
He's laid back.

[02:10:54.710 --> 02:10:56.810]
You can hear him better than me, really?

[02:10:56.930 --> 02:10:57.930]
Well, different tone.

[02:10:58.630 --> 02:10:59.190]
Well, we're different kind.

[02:10:59.190 --> 02:10:59.990]
More like a broadcaster.

[02:11:00.050 --> 02:11:00.830]
One of the reasons I like Neil.

[02:11:00.850 --> 02:11:02.330]
He stills into an unceasing.

[02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:02.670]
Yeah.

[02:11:03.590 --> 02:11:03.910]
Yeah.

[02:11:04.410 --> 02:11:07.850]
What did you think of Bead out impression of you this afternoon?

[02:11:08.210 --> 02:11:09.890]
It's like he's using a computer or something.

[02:11:10.050 --> 02:11:10.210]
Yeah.

[02:11:10.330 --> 02:11:11.210]
He was really screwed up.

[02:11:11.290 --> 02:11:12.190]
That's why we knew it wasn't you.

[02:11:12.290 --> 02:11:13.430]
He was dropping out and everything.

[02:11:13.530 --> 02:11:14.330]
And he wasn't muffled.

[02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:15.190]
So we knew it wasn't you.

[02:11:15.190 --> 02:11:19.130]
It was a bigger fan because I can't do him.

[02:11:19.950 --> 02:11:21.050]
Well, let's not get into that.

[02:11:21.710 --> 02:11:21.990]
Okay.

[02:11:22.630 --> 02:11:24.450]
Six to 10 a.m. 25 to 54.

[02:11:24.550 --> 02:11:25.430]
That's what you really want to know.

[02:11:25.470 --> 02:11:26.590]
Oh, I have a movie for you.

[02:11:27.170 --> 02:11:27.930]
Are you going to listen to me?

[02:11:27.970 --> 02:11:29.310]
I'm going to give you a big boost here.

[02:11:29.370 --> 02:11:31.130]
You went up from a 4.7 and a 4.9.

[02:11:32.290 --> 02:11:33.350]
And that's that 12 plus.

[02:11:33.670 --> 02:11:34.910]
No, that's 25 to 54.

[02:11:35.070 --> 02:11:35.750]
I'll get to that.

[02:11:35.890 --> 02:11:37.090]
She, you know, be patient now.

[02:11:37.170 --> 02:11:37.830]
We can just relax.

[02:11:37.970 --> 02:11:38.490]
Who beat us?

[02:11:38.970 --> 02:11:39.530]
Speak singly.

[02:11:39.610 --> 02:11:40.070]
Oh, geez.

[02:11:40.190 --> 02:11:41.170]
Now we got to go back again.

[02:11:41.230 --> 02:11:41.970]
Let's make it right.

[02:11:42.090 --> 02:11:42.350]
Magic.

[02:11:42.770 --> 02:11:43.650]
Had a six.

[02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:48.990]
Wacky, which no spaghetti glaze, Zeta, all of the drop from a 7-1-2-5, that's surprising.

[02:11:48.990 --> 02:11:49.450]
Isn't it?

[02:11:49.550 --> 02:11:50.630]
And the Reneerie had a five.

[02:11:51.230 --> 02:11:52.650]
Zeta is dropping like a rock.

[02:11:52.770 --> 02:11:53.190]
You know, both.

[02:11:53.710 --> 02:11:57.170]
Neal's enjoying one of the few times that a dancer can enjoy a slide.

[02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:58.330]
Tronch is a game.

[02:11:58.410 --> 02:11:59.470]
Tronch is a game.

[02:11:59.470 --> 02:11:59.710]
More.

[02:12:00.150 --> 02:12:00.770]
More doing.

[02:12:01.310 --> 02:12:01.770]
More is it.

[02:12:01.850 --> 02:12:02.470]
So I think.

[02:12:03.230 --> 02:12:03.530]
So much.

[02:12:03.730 --> 02:12:05.990]
Because you know what they say, what goes around comes around.

[02:12:06.190 --> 02:12:06.510]
You know what they say?

[02:12:06.510 --> 02:12:08.630]
So they solved the problem over there, sonny.

[02:12:08.730 --> 02:12:09.650]
You know, they turned the corner.

[02:12:10.270 --> 02:12:10.570]
Yeah.

[02:12:10.570 --> 02:12:13.050]
Number three of those shooting for some of them.

[02:12:13.170 --> 02:12:15.050]
But it's going to be number 20 through that.

[02:12:15.550 --> 02:12:16.230]
I like to.

[02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:18.390]
What was the logic you expressed a while ago about?

[02:12:18.770 --> 02:12:20.690]
You'd rather have like a two five, you can sell.

[02:12:21.730 --> 02:12:22.230]
Oh, yeah.

[02:12:22.250 --> 02:12:24.470]
Don't you need to be like the time to replace the sales department.

[02:12:24.910 --> 02:12:26.150]
I don't think I'm answering.

[02:12:26.450 --> 02:12:27.490]
Well, they've solved the problem.

[02:12:27.710 --> 02:12:29.550]
You guys worked without your phone, didn't you?

[02:12:29.550 --> 02:12:29.850]
Yeah.

[02:12:29.890 --> 02:12:30.610]
Because we have overhead.

[02:12:30.730 --> 02:12:31.130]
Are you sure?

[02:12:31.390 --> 02:12:31.450]
Are you sure?

[02:12:31.770 --> 02:12:32.270]
Are you not afraid?

[02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.610]
You can hear it.

[02:12:32.610 --> 02:12:33.570]
For everyone has overhead.

[02:12:34.470 --> 02:12:35.190]
Oh, I see.

[02:12:36.010 --> 02:12:36.610]
It's gone.

[02:12:36.870 --> 02:12:37.710]
Put away that trick, folks.

[02:12:38.190 --> 02:12:39.230]
I can't find it.

[02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:40.950]
I can't find six to 10 AM 12 plus.

[02:12:41.090 --> 02:12:41.930]
I will find it here.

[02:12:42.110 --> 02:12:43.070]
If we have to stay on the real estate.

[02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:43.790]
Well, I can climb it.

[02:12:43.850 --> 02:12:45.330]
We went from a four to a four five.

[02:12:45.610 --> 02:12:45.750]
All right.

[02:12:46.010 --> 02:12:46.950]
Here I got it.

[02:12:47.850 --> 02:12:48.350]
Let's see.

[02:12:48.590 --> 02:12:49.370]
I think that's a liar.

[02:12:49.810 --> 02:12:50.350]
No, no, no.

[02:12:50.710 --> 02:12:51.910]
We said this already.

[02:12:52.090 --> 02:12:53.530]
We went from a four to a four five.

[02:12:53.530 --> 02:12:54.290]
Number five.

[02:12:54.730 --> 02:12:57.970]
Beatin, not only by QBA and AQI, which no speaker in English.

[02:12:58.590 --> 02:13:00.910]
Renere, you had a six one in life, which doesn't count.

[02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:03.390]
So basically you were second among the real radio stations.

[02:13:03.590 --> 02:13:03.810]
Great.

[02:13:03.970 --> 02:13:04.450]
That's great.

[02:13:04.730 --> 02:13:05.390]
And I'm congratulations.

[02:13:05.670 --> 02:13:06.310]
Yeah, congratulations.

[02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:06.970]
Thanks a lot.

[02:13:07.070 --> 02:13:08.990]
I have any idea how you keep doing it, but be grateful.

[02:13:09.330 --> 02:13:10.510]
You don't want to miss a whole show.

[02:13:10.670 --> 02:13:11.430]
Is that what you're saying?

[02:13:11.590 --> 02:13:15.150]
You know why I want to take this time on to make sure that Neil's going to agree to that

[02:13:15.150 --> 02:13:15.510]
grand.

[02:13:15.750 --> 02:13:16.810]
No problem.

[02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:17.630]
I will trust me.

[02:13:17.730 --> 02:13:18.830]
There will be another 500 here.

[02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:19.770]
And that's between us.

[02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:22.050]
That'll be two grand, which is a real good deal.

[02:13:22.290 --> 02:13:22.850]
I appreciate it.

[02:13:22.890 --> 02:13:24.890]
By the way, my vet is much better looking at you.

[02:13:24.990 --> 02:13:25.330]
Is it?

[02:13:25.550 --> 02:13:26.230]
What color is it?

[02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:28.510]
It's black with black red.

[02:13:29.090 --> 02:13:29.330]
How do you feel?

[02:13:29.330 --> 02:13:29.950]
We're going to take back.

[02:13:30.510 --> 02:13:31.630]
You just give us the show for tomorrow.

[02:13:31.630 --> 02:13:32.230]
We'll take a poll.

[02:13:32.710 --> 02:13:34.510]
Which you're red or black, folks, on vents.

[02:13:34.510 --> 02:13:35.050]
Yeah.

[02:13:35.050 --> 02:13:38.910]
Well, nice being here, but you know, our boons waiting in line are.

[02:13:38.990 --> 02:13:42.130]
And your 10-year-old program director will get really upset if we give you too much.

[02:13:42.230 --> 02:13:43.550]
And herman and queen, thank you, sonny.

[02:13:43.550 --> 02:13:44.130]
You're very generous.

[02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.790]
Thank you.

[02:13:44.890 --> 02:13:45.070]
Thank you.

[02:13:45.070 --> 02:13:45.610]
Thank you for the good work.

[02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:46.490]
Thank you so much.

[02:13:46.530 --> 02:13:47.210]
Thanks, sonny.

[02:13:47.390 --> 02:13:49.750]
And the other promise we won't go on FM again for at least six months.

[02:13:50.130 --> 02:13:54.170]
This Steve doesn't Steve look like what's that guy Steve Rees?

[02:13:54.350 --> 02:13:55.930]
This is Steve right here as a matter of fact.

[02:13:57.530 --> 02:13:59.930]
He's got that gladiator look.

[02:14:00.190 --> 02:14:00.790]
Yeah, he sure does.

[02:14:01.130 --> 02:14:01.490]
Gladiator.

[02:14:01.590 --> 02:14:02.250]
We understand it.

[02:14:02.430 --> 02:14:03.570]
We know you're humorous, honey.

[02:14:03.570 --> 02:14:04.590]
Thank you very much.

[02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:06.930]
See, I told you, sonny, you can't escape, sonny.

[02:14:06.930 --> 02:14:08.210]
And also he's going to shine you.

[02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:09.450]
He's going to shine you.

[02:14:09.450 --> 02:14:10.110]
Really gladiator.

[02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:11.750]
Okay, say hi to him.

[02:14:12.050 --> 02:14:12.470]
You're really gladiator.

[02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:14.950]
While you're crossing Hellendale Beach Boulevard, be careful, sonny.

[02:14:15.330 --> 02:14:15.970]
Now that's terrific.

[02:14:16.150 --> 02:14:17.030]
A grand, okay?

[02:14:17.470 --> 02:14:18.890]
He promised 500 and he brought a thousand.

[02:14:19.410 --> 02:14:20.990]
And I'm going to bring another 500 in tomorrow.

[02:14:21.410 --> 02:14:21.610]
Great.

[02:14:22.230 --> 02:14:22.530]
Okay.

[02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.770]
I'm glad to do it.

[02:14:23.910 --> 02:14:25.270]
By the way, it's all tax deductible.

[02:14:25.390 --> 02:14:26.250]
It's a charity.

[02:14:26.490 --> 02:14:29.130]
It's all tax deductible for those of you cheapskates out there.

[02:14:29.190 --> 02:14:30.370]
So that should motivate you.

[02:14:30.450 --> 02:14:32.530]
I mean, here are two of the radio big wigs.

[02:14:32.530 --> 02:14:36.190]
And of course, since Greg called us, we expect him to be coming up with a check.

[02:14:36.570 --> 02:14:36.830]
Mm-hmm.

[02:14:37.050 --> 02:14:38.450]
Which he's been very generous to him.

[02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:39.930]
Ever we did the thing for the holiday fund?

[02:14:40.130 --> 02:14:40.830]
Wasn't it for that?

[02:14:41.130 --> 02:14:41.950]
Or was it so far?

[02:14:42.150 --> 02:14:42.790]
Whatever it was.

[02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:44.150]
What far he contributed.

[02:14:44.770 --> 02:14:46.230]
And Tanner up came up with a big check.

[02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:48.110]
And your good friend Irene got a check.

[02:14:48.590 --> 02:14:49.370]
Well, she did.

[02:14:49.730 --> 02:14:50.450]
Yes, she did.

[02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:51.550]
Yes, she did.

[02:14:51.810 --> 02:14:53.050]
I mean, don't hold that against her.

[02:14:54.050 --> 02:14:54.490]
I know.

[02:14:54.610 --> 02:14:55.950]
You don't want to hold anything against her.

[02:14:56.050 --> 02:14:56.290]
I know.

[02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:57.690]
You're so...

[02:14:57.690 --> 02:15:00.050]
Man, you ain't had to gloves and even w's news.

[02:15:00.150 --> 02:15:01.410]
It's a good thing I don't have any guns.

[02:15:01.410 --> 02:15:03.090]
I'm just going to run you against any former stations.

[02:15:03.330 --> 02:15:05.850]
You know, although Jada at night had a point to him,

[02:15:05.870 --> 02:15:08.730]
but I just thought I'd mention that again in case it's a deal.

[02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:11.270]
Well, beat him.

[02:15:11.450 --> 02:15:12.710]
So, you know, we got to give him a break.

[02:15:13.150 --> 02:15:13.910]
Oh, God.

[02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:16.110]
I hear woofy radio beat him to at night.

[02:15:16.670 --> 02:15:18.270]
11 before 2 at WIO.

[02:15:18.290 --> 02:15:19.190]
They want to tell you about me.

[02:15:19.210 --> 02:15:19.390]
God.

[02:15:21.470 --> 02:15:25.970]
And now the first one of the Americans with me is Roger.

[02:15:25.970 --> 02:15:25.970]

[02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:27.430]
El Abraham.

[02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.430]

[02:15:29.150 --> 02:15:31.790]
El京敦 Cuba

[02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:33.590]
212 006

[02:15:33.590 --> 02:15:33.590]

[02:15:33.590 --> 02:15:33.590]

[02:15:33.590 --> 02:15:37.110]
Understand

[02:15:43.570 --> 02:15:52.130]
So that's where we are.

[02:15:52.810 --> 02:15:55.210]
and I brought in the 500 being a cheap skate

[02:15:55.210 --> 02:15:57.130]
and I'll bring in the other 500 tomorrow, no problem.

[02:15:58.490 --> 02:16:00.810]
And you know, you folks better get on a bandwagon now,

[02:16:00.910 --> 02:16:02.930]
okay, make the checks on today while you're motivated,

[02:16:02.930 --> 02:16:05.070]
while you hear that the big shooters are doing their thing,

[02:16:05.070 --> 02:16:07.790]
you better write out your check for 10 or 20 or 50.

[02:16:07.970 --> 02:16:09.410]
And again, if you want one of those cassettes,

[02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:11.610]
which are gonna be ready, well, at least the master

[02:16:11.610 --> 02:16:13.430]
will be ready on Sunday, so they'll start going out

[02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:17.150]
next week, then a $20 check or more to Camilla's house.

[02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:19.010]
Don't be a piker if you can afford more than that,

[02:16:19.090 --> 02:16:21.130]
then you know, make the check out for 50 or 100,

[02:16:21.130 --> 02:16:22.370]
whatever it all adds up big.

[02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:25.430]
And you know, a stamp self-adreced envelope,

[02:16:25.710 --> 02:16:27.330]
a 90 minute cassette, right?

[02:16:27.650 --> 02:16:30.030]
And if you don't have the envelope life, we'll go on,

[02:16:30.050 --> 02:16:30.910]
we'll still get it out to you.

[02:16:31.110 --> 02:16:36.550]
And may let the Near Rogers WIOD Miami 331-41, okay?

[02:16:36.970 --> 02:16:39.690]
I just want to remark about what a star-studded program

[02:16:39.690 --> 02:16:40.710]
has been an incredible day.

[02:16:40.770 --> 02:16:43.310]
This is like old times again, like on INZ,

[02:16:43.430 --> 02:16:44.950]
on a kicking ass station.

[02:16:45.630 --> 02:16:46.530]
Three years, one more time.

[02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:49.250]
For the West, one more time for the West Coast

[02:16:49.250 --> 02:16:52.110]
to make it complete and really bring back those memories, okay?

[02:16:53.350 --> 02:16:58.530]
Kick an ass with 50,000 watts of power all over South Florida

[02:16:59.090 --> 02:17:02.290]
from the keys to the Palm Beaches, even out to the Bahamas.

[02:17:02.810 --> 02:17:04.430]
This is WIOD.

[02:17:04.670 --> 02:17:06.390]
Oh yeah, this was WIOD.

[02:17:06.770 --> 02:17:09.370]
Say this never was, this is WIOD for those

[02:17:09.370 --> 02:17:11.190]
who aren't quite sure and we want to make sure you are.

[02:17:11.590 --> 02:17:15.930]
Let me say it again, WIOD, but that was WIOD.

[02:17:16.030 --> 02:17:18.090]
He wants to put a plan, that's 18, these numbers, man,

[02:17:18.090 --> 02:17:20.390]
it's a shadow of its former self.

[02:17:20.830 --> 02:17:21.990]
True, we don't want to rub it in.

[02:17:22.270 --> 02:17:23.030]
Well, yes we do.

[02:17:24.170 --> 02:17:24.990]
Miami, hello.

[02:17:25.690 --> 02:17:26.230]
Hello, Neil.

[02:17:26.530 --> 02:17:26.670]
Yeah.

[02:17:27.250 --> 02:17:29.750]
I called the USDA, I thought you'd be interested in what they had to say.

[02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:30.170]
Okay.

[02:17:30.910 --> 02:17:34.050]
First of all, the lady wanted to know who was giving out their phone number.

[02:17:34.410 --> 02:17:34.530]
Yeah.

[02:17:34.650 --> 02:17:36.710]
It's been inundated with calls for the last two hours.

[02:17:36.970 --> 02:17:37.250]
Great.

[02:17:37.590 --> 02:17:40.090]
The second thing was that the meat was sent from Connecticut

[02:17:40.090 --> 02:17:43.170]
and the reason the decision has been made to destroy it

[02:17:43.170 --> 02:17:46.610]
or hand it out is because they're not sure that your affection

[02:17:47.250 --> 02:17:50.250]
it may go back to Connecticut and therefore the state of Connecticut

[02:17:50.250 --> 02:17:51.710]
will decide what to do with it.

[02:17:52.170 --> 02:17:54.210]
If they're interested in it, if they'd afford it,

[02:17:54.330 --> 02:17:57.250]
then it would be the state's decision to destroy it or hand it out.

[02:17:57.550 --> 02:17:57.630]
Yeah.

[02:17:57.850 --> 02:18:00.150]
The meat is not contaminated, it's frozen.

[02:18:00.750 --> 02:18:04.150]
And as they understand it, the only problem with it is it's too tough.

[02:18:04.370 --> 02:18:04.770]
What is it?

[02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:06.330]
It's too tough for their standards.

[02:18:06.550 --> 02:18:08.250]
That's yeah, but it's still very edible.

[02:18:08.250 --> 02:18:10.830]
And I'm sure that the people are starving to death would not quibble,

[02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:11.570]
you know, one way or the other.

[02:18:11.610 --> 02:18:11.750]
Right.

[02:18:11.910 --> 02:18:14.470]
She said to call back either tomorrow or the day after

[02:18:14.470 --> 02:18:16.550]
and they would have the name of the person responsible

[02:18:16.550 --> 02:18:18.630]
for making the decision to destroy it or not.

[02:18:18.930 --> 02:18:19.150]
Mm-hmm.

[02:18:19.330 --> 02:18:19.630]
Great.

[02:18:20.130 --> 02:18:21.650]
So call them back.

[02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:22.510]
Okay.

[02:18:22.690 --> 02:18:24.090]
And they still know who to get on.

[02:18:24.270 --> 02:18:24.470]
All right.

[02:18:24.550 --> 02:18:29.310]
The number again is 1-800-535-4555.

[02:18:29.770 --> 02:18:29.910]
Right.

[02:18:30.010 --> 02:18:32.350]
And it took me about 20 minutes to get through because...
