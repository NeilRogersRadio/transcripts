[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]
The prize Chevrolet by mistake.

[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.360]
Southern Auto Parts junkyard owner, Sam Parasy says it was an honest mistake.

[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.360]
Police say no laws were broken.

[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.840]
Sam who?

[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.740]
Parasy.

[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.460]
Parasy?

[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.860]
How are we spelling that?

[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.440]

[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.480]
P-A-R-I-S-I?

[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.660]
Yeah.

[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.500]
Parasy?

[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.760]
Well, Sam said...

[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.980]
Just a guess on my part.

[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.160]
I don't think it's Parasy.

[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.940]
Parasy, I said.

[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.400]
Yeah, I try to slip these by and I...

[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.280]
Yeah, you slip.

[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.120]
Be on the lookout for dissolving checks.

[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.200]
Checks treated with a chemical that causes him to disintegrate shortly after being deposited

[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.280]
of shown up in Memphis and Chicago.

[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.700]
And you never guess who wrote them.

[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.540]
Ha ha ha.

[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.420]
Now here's the question.

[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.960]
What's the question?

[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.000]
Yeah, not Larry Kay.

[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.680]
Here's the scam.

[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.680]
Somebody opens an account with a small amount of money and later makes a larger deposit

[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.940]
with the dissolving check.

[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.540]
Before the check dissolves, the person withdraws the money and disappears.

[00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.380]
By the way, what station can Larry Kay be heard on in Dayton Broward?

[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.840]
W-P-B-R?

[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.840]
I said like, what...

[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.760]
Oh, Dayton Broward, none.

[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.780]
Hurd on in Dayton Broward.

[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.320]
No, none.

[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.760]
Hmm.

[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.580]
Isn't that string?

[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.220]
Isn't it?

[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.040]
Partly cloudy today and tomorrow, our highs will be near 80 and our lows are not near 70.

[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.040]
And it's 74 now.

[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260]
On Zeta 4, it's 852.

[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.440]
My briefs.

[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.840]
Not my briefs, my briefcase.

[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.520]
Look at this.

[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.960]
This is a blast from the past.

[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.700]
This is from the September 16th, 1987, Weekly News page 39.

[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.440]
Labor Day 1987 was certainly busy for the Weekly News's Jack Sturdy as he stopped at

[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.980]
some of Broward County's most popular watering holes to shoot the pictures on this page

[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.440]
is 39 and 55.

[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.920]
To shoot the pics on this page is 30.

[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.640]
What kind of grammar is that?

[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.280]
At Backthreat, a hurricane party topped the weekends during line and Evelyn Thomas

[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.860]
had clumped 21 to annual black and white ball was the event to attend as dozens of entertainers

[00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.400]
volunteered the efforts for this PWA fund riser at the Copa.

[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.060]
Mikkel Brown saying her manpower hit as the crowd hot crowd danced to the music.

[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.160]
Attackies, their packed tea dance brought out men.

[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.540]
What?

[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.260]
A tea dance?

[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.940]
As in tea room.

[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.580]
Oh, I didn't know they did that there.

[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.340]
Their tea dance brought out men who like to pose for Jack's camera and all told Jack and

[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.520]
friends top left seem to have labored happily all weekend long.

[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.360]
And all these kind of well, all these clones, you know, even the broaden here's got a mustache.

[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.320]
Almost everybody in the seriously look at these guys.

[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.020]
They've all got that little clone mustache.

[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.460]
Yeah.

[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.060]
Yeah.

[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.880]
It's like they pasted them on.

[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.060]
They went to the bar and tied one on so to speak.

[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.140]
Look at air.

[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.040]
Almost every but there's somebody now nobody in this picture on top here as a mustache.

[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.000]
And in the upper right hand corner of what these other two very interesting looking people

[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.100]
is no other than Alice Randell at that place.

[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.580]
I'll be darn it says Copa underneath it at the Copa.

[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000]
So he must have been doing research for one of those many, many shows that he does on homosexuals or something like that.

[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.540]
Alice must have been doing research must have been.

[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.900]
So we still have that picture there.

[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.900]
Love it dear.

[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.080]
You know, I think you're adorable.

[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.900]
I really do.

[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.500]
I'll bet you hear that a lot.

[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.200]
You don't?

[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.940]
Mm-hmm.

[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.960]
Well, I think you're quite a handsome doll myself.

[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.600]
Okay, now back to pool.

[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.280]
That was a pretty nice break.

[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.260]
Pretty good shot.

[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.920]
You know how I can tell right now you're a pool shark?

[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.720]
How?

[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.980]
Well, there's something about the way you stand with that post-ick in your hand.

[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.360]
I'm going to turn on the truth box.

[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.660]
I want to play while shooting.

[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.460]
Yeah.

[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.020]
Wait, next time I play, I'll think of you.

[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.860]
You are good.

[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.300]
You want.

[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.120]
But the least I can do is buy you another beer.

[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.220]
Uh, Joe, make that two beers please.

[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.260]
Well, well, I think you became a bit distracting to me if I made these no honest.

[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.580]
I have other things on my mind right now.

[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.000]
I've kind of been picturing you with your arms around me holding me close to you.

[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:32.780]
I pictured you kissing my neck softly and telling me that you think that you could fall in love with me.

[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.020]
See, ever since we started our game of pool, I knew something special was happening between us.

[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.420]
You felt that too, didn't you?

[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.500]
I know you did.

[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.980]
Nothing like a big man like you.

[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.700]
Every woman likes to be held.

[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.880]
It feels so good to be in your arms.

[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.560]
I can't wait for us to play another game of pool real soon.

[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.800]
I'm looking forward to it.

[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.440]
Aren't you coming back tomorrow for a new romantic fantasy?

[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.660]
Bye.

[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.760]
Bye.

[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.340]
Oh, that's not.

[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.720]
Is that another Dave Ryder rip off?

[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.520]
You've grown up, Amy.

[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.000]
Yeah.

[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.220]
That's like X rated Amy.

[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.600]
We have T-N-A-Me.

[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.620]
R rated Amy, X rated Amy, and then we have Psychotic Amy, which is other story.

[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.780]
We won't get into it today.

[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.600]
That's a 976X.

[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.940]
Yeah.

[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.740]
Let me ask you a question about it.

[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.600]
858.

[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.000]
I'll say to four.

[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.880]
All right, Arita.

[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.040]
Here's your re-thra.

[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.720]
Happy birthday, Arita.

[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.360]
Notice Rose Folder is conspicuous by her abs in so far.

[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.000]
Oh.

[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.720]
Am I right?

[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.620]
This is the latest that we've gone in a dog's age and that he hasn't shown up in a dolphin's age.

[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.860]
Yeah, that is longer, dolphin's age.

[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.320]
By the way, if you were listening earlier, we really hope you enjoyed the call to Luke

[00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.480]
Halpin, who was a little bit, um, surly at the beginning of the call, but we buttered

[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.700]
him up.

[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.260]
I didn't call.

[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.640]
He was eating out of the palm of our hand, just like flipper with the palm of our flipper.

[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.320]
Just like flipper.

[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.620]
Yeah.

[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.080]
Two minutes past night on Zeta 4 and we'll go back to these calls now because this morning

[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.480]
has been quite an epic.

[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.340]
Dave County.

[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.180]
Hello.

[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.840]
Yes, sir.

[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.400]
Who's this?

[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.300]
This is Neil.

[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.240]
Yeah, how you doing?

[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.680]
Okay.

[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.140]
Who's this?

[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.320]
This is Jane Goldberg.

[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.860]
How's everything?

[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.820]
Okay, Jane.

[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.840]
You know, you come from Rochester, correct?

[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.600]
That is correct.

[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.280]
And you never talk about ice hockey.

[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.860]
Why is that?

[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.320]
Well, I don't know why because I used to go see all those Americans games, Rochester Amherst.

[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.480]
I like the Pacific State.

[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.320]
That is correct.

[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.940]
A lot of it.

[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.400]
I've been up there.

[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.200]
My brother and all my friends went to Brockport, you know Brockport.

[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.840]
I sure do.

[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.320]
And let me tell you something.

[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.360]
I'm a first time caller.

[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.220]
Listen to your show every morning and I think you're great.

[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.240]
But you're right, Jane.

[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.940]
I'm right.

[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.300]
I was from New York City and I used to listen to that guy stand.

[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.660]
But you're 100 times better than him.

[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.280]
But yeah, all Howard, Howard's got about three words that he knows how to say and that's about it.

[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.300]
I saw him with that Morton show.

[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.780]
He's an ugly sucker.

[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.060]
Yeah, he looks like twisted sister on a bad day.

[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.260]
You said that once.

[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.060]
I don't know if you say that.

[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.260]
Yeah.

[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.220]
I just want to tell you your show is great.

[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.840]
I like the bread.

[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.140]
I like Kat and Dave.

[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.680]
He's cool.

[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.360]
You should be upfront with you guys though.

[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.680]
Donna.

[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.340]
No.

[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.660]
Now we'd like to leave him in the other room because he eats so damn much.

[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.540]
He creates a lot of, a lot of problems.

[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.180]
You know, I never met you.

[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.000]
Where can I meet you?

[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.800]
I hear all these things.

[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.620]
I had an e-Mac, and bullioes and stuff.

[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.740]
When you're going to make another public appearance.

[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.640]
Well, let you know, Jane.

[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.120]
Maybe it Don and Bob's.

[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.480]
Don and Bob's.

[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.580]
Hey, listen, are you really into hockey or are you just, you know, so soft?

[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.840]
I used to announce hockey.

[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.780]
Jane, I'm a big hockey fan.

[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.320]
Really?

[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.200]
I want to tell you, now we have a street hockey league down on the ice, daily road.

[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.160]
Well, North Miami.

[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.100]
Good luck to you, Jane.

[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.220]
Okay, well, Neil, it's a place talking to you.

[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:39.740]
Okay.

[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.080]
Thanks a lot.

[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.020]
See you later.

[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.600]
See, he was about to do a plug for the street hockey thing.

[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.460]
And I just, I can't do that, Jane, because that's going to put everybody into a coma.

[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.060]
But no, I love hockey.

[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.860]
Just too bad we don't get to see more of it down here.

[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.880]
Of course, if I guess I, if I had a satellite dish.

[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.140]
Then I'd be able to see everything, right?

[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.960]
I don't know why you like hockey.

[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.800]
All they do is just beat the hell out of each other.

[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.460]
I mean, compared to like baseball, I can see even football.

[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.360]
Oh, yeah, even football, which, of course, there's no violence in football.

[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.800]
Well, physical content.

[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.220]
Well, it's like, you know, they aggressively block and everything.

[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.320]
Oh, yeah, they aggressively block and everything.

[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.580]
Every play they just about, they're 22 guys falling on top of each other.

[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.520]
You don't even understand what hockey's all about.

[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.260]
Well, they have no, they have no, they have no, they don't even understand what it's all about.

[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.320]
And about the, the speed and the grace and the great passing in the,

[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.160]
great, but, oh, my God, in great ways, an incredible goal tending and penalty shots.

[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.440]
Then they have to prove their coach.

[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:29.680]
You don't understand.

[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.360]
To keep their jobs, they have to prove to their coaches, what a jerk they are by beating up on.

[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.240]
And of course, we know there's no violence or physical contact in like basketball,

[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.600]
even college basketball is like wrestling.

[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.480]
They're trying to get wrestling and are beating the crap out of each other

[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.000]
and they're rolling around on the floor and stepping on each other's contact lenses.

[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.340]
Well, you know, they're trying to get rid of shame on them.

[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.340]
That's what I say, but in hockey, it's like part of the excuse us.

[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.880]
Okay, excuse us.

[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.860]
Yeah, there's too much violence in hockey, but that's because the public loves it.

[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.980]
They, they eat it up.

[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.360]
Yeah, it's like going to a car.

[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.000]
Like you said, going to see you guys, they want to see somebody, you know, blow up or going to see boxing.

[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.420]
They want to see the blood and the guts and they want to see somebody's eye pop out.

[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.500]
That's what the public want.

[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.340]
They're all the lawyers.

[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.940]
They're all in this rubber necking.

[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.420]
Well, I must have missed that one when the eye popped up.

[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.060]
Well, we're waiting.

[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.420]
In fact, matter of fact, that happened in a hockey game years ago.

[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.600]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.040]
Yes, it did.

[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.740]
I don't want to tell you about the guy who skated over it.

[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.260]
That's 905.

[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.920]
I'd say to four. That's a true story, but we'll save that for another day.

[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.520]
Okay, move it right along.

[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.680]
That's, I knew that would make you like the game a lot better.

[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.300]
Yeah, now I got like, yeah, Broward County.

[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:40.900]
Hello.

[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:41.600]
Hi.

[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:42.440]
How are you doing?

[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.260]
Fine. How are you?

[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:43.760]
Okay.

[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.400]
Sneal.

[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:44.740]
Yeah.

[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.900]
Oh, I just wanted to say that I love you show it's the first time I've ever called.

[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.520]
I've been listening to you since October.

[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.440]
And you didn't call up until then.

[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.440]
Now, something must have happened today to motivate you to make you say to yourself.

[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.560]
Today, I'm going to do it.

[00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.340]
Exactly right.

[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.020]
I just wanted to tell you that you shouldn't replace the bird with Alan.

[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:02.960]
It's just not used.

[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.820]
You just don't reason why you should do that.

[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.800]
No, we know who said we were going to place the bird with Alan.

[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.600]
We never saw it.

[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.520]
Oh, I didn't mean it like that.

[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.800]
I just mean it happens to be true, but yeah, that's true.

[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.200]
Now wait a minute.

[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.180]
What's in the bag there?

[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:15.980]
My bag.

[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.340]
He's got a bag here with bagels in it.

[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.880]
I'll be guy-starred.

[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.760]
Do we have any cream cheese?

[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.400]
It's in back there.

[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.200]
Oh, it's in the bag.

[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:23.940]
Okay.

[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.680]
Yeah, the bird's eating again.

[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.380]
Sir, everybody's eating around me here like a feeding frenzy.

[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.140]
I just got a lot of salt on it.

[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:31.740]
I don't think so.

[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.020]
I don't like these real salty ones.

[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.760]
Well, I said it's great hearing from you.

[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.140]
Okay.

[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.960]
I'm not going to cut you sure, but I mean I thought maybe that was like...

[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.020]
No, you made a great point, sir.

[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.440]
No, you really did.

[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.380]
It's right now.

[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.560]
You made it here.

[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.040]
Never mind.

[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:46.780]
Go ahead.

[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.020]
You said you made a great point.

[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.340]
I said you made a great point.

[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.380]
I made a great point.

[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.300]
Well, the bird is great and I don't think you know Alan is okay.

[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.740]
He's kind of cute and everything and I'm like, look at him.

[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.300]
Wait a minute.

[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:56.680]
Wait a minute.

[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.260]
Do you know Alan?

[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.720]
No, I don't know Alan.

[00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.640]
Then how do you know he's cute?

[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.820]
Well, I just assumed that he's cute because you've only been telling me that for two months.

[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.480]
I'm going to tell you, he's not just cute.

[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.840]
I just can't find the words, okay?

[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.000]
Seriously.

[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:09.940]
I'm sorry.

[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.560]
I'm never really at a loss for words, but there are no words.

[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.240]
I understand.

[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.080]
I just wanted to ask you for a date.

[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.980]
Maybe when you get off, I could buy your breakfast.

[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.160]
That's three this morning.

[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.860]
Boy, this must be going to be a great weekend for me.

[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:23.240]
You're having a good day.

[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.560]
Well, listen, I'll take a rain check, okay?

[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.660]
Okay, I understand.

[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:27.560]
I know you do.

[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:33.080]
You've got a great show and I'll first say you answer the phone and I thank you and everything and this is great.

[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.340]
Okay, we'll see you all later.

[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:34.700]
Okay.

[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.240]
Bye-bye.

[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.960]
Boy, I've had three propositions this morning, huh?

[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.040]
Thank you, Claire.

[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.300]
She's bringing me some coffee.

[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.120]
Wasn't that nice?

[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.700]
That's really very nice.

[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.000]
I appreciate it very much.

[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.340]
I don't see any cream cheese, though.

[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.060]
That's okay.

[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.700]
Don't get hysterical now.

[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:52.380]
Isn't that nice?

[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.500]
Brought me coffee.

[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.640]
That's real nice.

[00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:05.340]
Guy called and has your furniture on his truck from Levitts and says he can't wait until you get home.

[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:14.020]
So he's dropping it off at the warehouse.

[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:14.820]
No.

[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.920]
You mean to say that that mung-brain in my house won't get up to let the furniture in?

[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.960]
Now, wait, you let this guy go?

[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.720]
He was on hold.

[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.140]
What do you mean he was on hold?

[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.880]
He was on hold and I said that you were busy and I said,

[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:34.580]
Oh, no.

[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.480]
I just cannot believe this.

[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:36.840]
Okay.

[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.480]
I can't believe this.

[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.020]
Where are they going to drop it?

[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.260]
At the warehouse.

[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.440]
He said that he was on his way to your house right now.

[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.100]
And he says that he found out that you weren't there.

[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.320]
But there's somebody there.

[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.040]
Well, see, I didn't know what to tell him.

[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.660]
He was on hold and I said, I didn't use that name.

[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.800]
I used my real name.

[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.600]
How do you know it's my house?

[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.180]
Didn't that amazing?

[00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:58.940]
I don't know.

[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.240]
He said, he knew Joey.

[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.620]
What are you talking about?

[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.980]
Anyway, I said, it's going to be a while before he takes a break to talk to you.

[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.940]
I said, let me get your number.

[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.380]
Do I have to be there?

[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.220]
It's paid for.

[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.420]
All he's got to do is go there and ring the bell and devil and a minute of deliver the furniture.

[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.000]
Yeah, that's kind of surly, man.

[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.600]
He was like saying, he says, well, if I had to know he wasn't going to be there till about 10, 15 or 10, 30.

[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.100]
Why do I have to be there?

[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.260]
Somebody is there.

[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.580]
Well, here's the number.

[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.260]
You people that levets you're out of your minds.

[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.180]
Well, here's the number.

[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.740]
He says ask for the warehouse man.

[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.080]
I want to, yeah, give me the number right.

[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.620]
I'm going to call these people on a year.

[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:34.940]
Okay.

[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.160]
What's the goddamn number?

[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.320]
That you see, that's the problem with being on a year.

[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.120]
Like these people know my whole life.

[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:41.500]
I know.

[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.160]
There's somebody there to take the damn thing.

[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.000]
I know.

[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:50.020]

[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.640]
Do you believe this?

[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.960]
Ask for what?

[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:56.900]
You better hurry up.

[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.200]
Where are these cities unloading it?

[00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.440]
Yeah, unload this.

[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.020]
Let me tell you, you can take that furniture and stick it up your ear at levets, okay?

[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:06.520]
Hello.

[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.840]
Yeah, is this the warehouse?

[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.400]
Uh, what can I do for you?

[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.620]
This is a nea Rogers, I'm say to four radio.

[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.300]
I'll be on the radio.

[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:12.720]
Yeah.

[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.000]
What's going on with you guys?

[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.860]
You know, I bought some furniture there the other day.

[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.120]
It's supposed to be delivered this morning.

[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.160]
There's somebody in the house.

[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.580]
And the guy assumes that because I'm on ear, there's nobody there.

[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.340]
Wouldn't it be, wouldn't it be a good idea if he went there and rang the bell first?

[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.380]
And we had somebody let him in to deliver the furniture?

[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.440]
What's that a brother Boeward do you live on?

[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.320]
No, I'm not going to do this on a year.

[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.140]
What do you mean, which side?

[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.020]
They got the address.

[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.300]
I just want to try and figure out who the truck driver was.

[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.000]
Oh, it's on its west of Pine Island.

[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.320]
There's west of Pine Island for that.

[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.280]
Unbelievable.

[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.640]
He's listening to the show.

[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.360]
Yeah, that's great.

[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:45.840]
I can't believe this.

[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.820]
What's the who the driver is?

[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.620]
I mean, do I have to be there?

[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.300]
Let me let you talk to the store manager.

[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.420]
Oh my god.

[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.120]
Yeah, they're going to start with that.

[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:55.660]
Okay.

[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.980]
Love it after 9 on Zeta 4.

[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.500]
I apologize to the audience for doing this, but it's an emergency.

[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.480]
Now, they don't get that furniture in his house today.

[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.140]
I'm going to go to Levitts and give them an offer they can't refuse.

[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.260]
Do you believe this?

[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.340]
Everything is fine.

[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.660]
Everything is fine.

[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.220]
Maybe he just unloaded like the big stuff.

[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:13.660]
What do you do?

[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.420]
Put me on hold with some of this music now?

[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.520]
Probably got life on the music on hold.

[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.980]
They said they were listening.

[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.380]
Can't believe this.

[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.100]
The guy, the truck driver knew that I wasn't there.

[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.680]
How does he know who it is?

[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.240]
They just know.

[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.080]
I don't do business under Neil Rogers.

[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:29.760]
They just know.

[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.220]
I don't know how, but they know.

[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:31.740]
They do.

[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:32.580]
Do they really?

[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:32.880]

[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.680]
Well, let him stick it in your ear.

[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.100]
Okay.

[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:36.860]
He knows that I'm not there.

[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.260]
So does that mean that there's nobody home?

[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.860]
You may want to hang for a second, Roger.

[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.640]
I've never heard of this.

[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.140]
Spide-away Levitts is buying any spots on his show, Tom, to stick it in your ear.

[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:45.500]
Okay.

[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.120]
It's not all mighty.

[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.540]
You know, that's not cool for advertising.

[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.380]
What's that?

[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.480]
Well, I got news for you, boy.

[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.540]
I'd love to do the spots.

[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.020]
I'll do them live.

[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:57.440]
Okay.

[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.600]
Tell them, hey, they got some great stuff, but you'll never see it.

[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:01.760]
You're right.

[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.020]
Hang on a minute.

[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:03.600]
Okay.

[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.580]
And they're listening over there to top it all off.

[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:07.840]
That's kind of make sense.

[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.540]
All they got to do is go there and ring the bell about 20 or 30 times, and Mungbrae will get out of bed.

[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.180]
He'll get out of bed.

[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:13.820]
Bang on the door.

[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.300]
Exactly.

[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.720]
And scream, hey, you idiot.

[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.420]
Get out of bed.

[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.040]
Where's he off?

[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.920]
Go in there and hold a 357 back.

[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.000]
And do his studies used to that.

[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.560]
How about works?

[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.120]
Tommy with a plantation pigs.

[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.500]
That works great.

[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.020]
Boy.

[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:25.160]
Hello.

[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.340]
Yes, hello.

[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.260]
So what's going on?

[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.320]
Where is my furniture?

[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:32.600]
Hello?

[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:33.000]
Hello.

[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.660]
I can't believe you believe this truck.

[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.600]
It's still in the truck.

[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:38.280]
Well, why is it still on the truck?

[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.980]
Because they get out with it.

[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.060]
Why is it still on the truck?

[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.840]
Why aren't they delivering my furniture?

[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.420]
Why isn't it going to the warehouse instead of my house?

[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:53.120]
I mean, I'm sure that you'd like to furnish the warehouse and have it looked real nice, but I can't afford to buy furniture for the warehouse.

[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:54.980]
Is it a merchant or your name?

[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.860]
Yeah, it's under my name.

[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.800]
Not under Neo Rodgers, it's under my real name.

[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.720]
I don't have any idea how this got involved with this show.

[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.760]
Put your hand on the dumb button.

[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.280]
What's the real name?

[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.560]
The real name is Be Health for you, idiots.

[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.880]
Everybody knows my real name.

[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.220]
And not only that, but what the hell does Neo Rodgers have to do with this?

[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.160]
Oh, that one.

[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:19.880]
Okay, I got it.

[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.060]
Oh, that one.

[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.400]
So what's the problem?

[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.100]
Why are we getting messages here that the truck driver isn't taking the furniture there?

[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.260]
He's taking it to the warehouse because he knows I'm not home.

[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.380]
What is that all about?

[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.000]
Are you people brained that over there or what?

[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.740]
How do you expect the driver to take your furniture to your house if you're not home?

[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.380]
Because there's somebody else there, okay?

[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.960]
And he hasn't been there.

[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.840]
Now, maybe if he went there and rang the bell, somebody might let him in and he can deliver the furniture, okay?

[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.280]
Oh, I'm, do you believe this?

[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.660]
Do you believe this?

[00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.880]
I want to, I'm going to tell you a little story about Levit.

[00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.320]
It's okay.

[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.000]
I went there the other day and I bought this stuff and I had some good deals here, okay?

[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.600]
And I bought a few things at Dynet set and some rent tables.

[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.000]
And the guy says to me, I give him my credit card.

[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.940]
He says, oh, we don't take those credit cards.

[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:14.860]
We have our own charge and give us your credit card and your driver's license and your phone number.

[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.140]
A two minutes man will fill it out.

[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:16.700]
You'll be all set.

[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.240]
40 minutes later, I'm still filling out forms.

[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.160]
Even if the White House, they don't have so much red tape to fill out.

[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.580]
Oh, I remember this place.

[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:30.140]
Oh my God, I'm telling you by the time you get through filling the forms out, you could have, you could have gone and, you know, you could have died already.

[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.000]
You could have built a table.

[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:35.620]
Exactly. You could have gotten and built your own furniture and painted it and lacquered it.

[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.420]
Well, why do you think they're so confused?

[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.060]
And now they can't, they can't, and why is there nobody on this line, by the way?

[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.040]
Why is there nobody speaking to us?

[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.000]
They hung up, I think.

[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:46.580]
They did?

[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:47.840]
I don't hear anything.

[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:49.740]
Hello?

[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.300]
No, they're not there.

[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:50.800]
No, they're somebody on there.

[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.960]
They're just like, hello.

[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:52.540]
Hello.

[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.820]
Yeah, what's going on?

[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.320]
Nothing, we were talking and nobody was there.

[00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.460]
What do you mean you were talking?

[00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.060]
I've been sitting here trying to get an answer.

[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.000]
Now, what's going on with my furniture, please?

[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.060]
It's calming.

[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.520]
Yeah, so is Christmas.

[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.220]
I don't remember, do I?

[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.260]
I don't know what's at the house.

[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.440]
Well, so what's, there is someone at the house.

[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.920]
Why do you have doubts that there's someone at the house?

[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.240]
Am I making it up?

[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.020]
I don't know.

[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.420]
I mean, don't, I know if there's somebody else living in my house.

[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.380]
I hope so.

[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.140]
I mean, how is it that you people are all such experts on who's in my house?

[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.300]
I'm the second here at the house.

[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.480]
Okay, here's somebody else.

[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.180]
Okay, great.

[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.160]
Here's the eighth manager.

[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.720]
Here's the eighth manager now.

[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.060]
They want to talk to Uncle Neil.

[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:34.600]
Yeah, great.

[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:35.900]
They're very confused.

[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.340]
915 on Zeta 4 as we continue talking to our friends.

[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.060]
Leave it at 11.

[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.120]
Leave it to Levitts.

[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.160]
Leave it at Levitts.

[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:42.160]

[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:42.720]
Oh, God.

[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.400]
How many hours?

[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.180]
Can I help you?

[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:45.740]
Yes.

[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.940]
Okay, what can I help you with?

[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.200]
What you can help me with is to tell me, and we're on the air by the way, on the radio.

[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.400]
So let's try to conduct ourselves in a civilized manner.

[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.720]
I think that's real good.

[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.880]
Yeah, now what seems to be the problem?

[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.280]
Why is it that your driver doesn't want to deliver my furniture to my house?

[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.560]
Why wouldn't he want to deliver it to your house?

[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.120]
Because he called here earlier and said that he knows that I'm on the air and that I'm not home.

[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.280]
So therefore he's taking the furniture to the warehouse.

[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.600]
Oh, he's already been informed that there is someone at your home and he found his way.

[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.020]
Yeah, but why would he assume that?

[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:20.800]
In other words, if I told them to deliver it today and that there would be somebody there, why would he assume otherwise?

[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.920]
I can't answer for him, sir.

[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:23.700]
I have no idea.

[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.580]
I mean, is your driver brain dead?

[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.020]
No, I don't think so.

[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.100]
He happens to be a very experienced driver.

[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:30.760]
Really?

[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.000]
Well, I think perhaps if he listened to the radio less and paid more attention to him,

[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.760]
it's a 24-till-night on Zeta 4 and we'll come right back.

[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.440]
I was kind of confused at first.

[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.300]
So then how the hell does he know who I am and where I am?

[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:47.460]
I don't think he knew who he worked because he kept saying this guy, they say this guy works there under some capacity.

[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.020]
I was going to wait a second, you know.

[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.120]
He didn't really know.

[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.360]
Oh, yeah, likely story, right?

[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.780]
He works there under some capacity.

[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.080]
If he's delivering the furniture, what is he calling here for?

[00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.260]
Maybe one of the mega requests.

[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.400]
Yeah, right. I got a request for him, okay?

[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.880]
Do you remember that movie duel with Dennis Weaver?

[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.680]
Yeah.

[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:07.940]
Spielberg film.

[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:08.880]
This first big film.

[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.700]
With the truck driver?

[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.000]
I think that's the truck driver that's got my furniture, okay?

[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.360]
He's going to follow you.

[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:19.980]
Now listen, when the people at Bones showed up here several weeks ago and it really was much too long ago

[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.060]
with that little burger.

[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:21.860]
What just happened there?

[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:22.780]
Have you got your coffee and your handbag?

[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.460]
I saved it from falling, didn't he?

[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.820]
Wow, that was an incredible move.

[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.040]
What a look.

[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.040]
If you would have had your Bones cup, that wouldn't happen.

[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.120]
I, because it's more like waiting.

[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.040]
It's easier to handbag.

[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:32.900]
I see it better.

[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.300]
I can't believe I saved it.

[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.300]
That's easier to get a grip on.

[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:40.420]
Anyway, I'm telling you, they brought us the most incredible barbecue ribs, beef and pork

[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.780]
and beans and coalslaw.

[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.000]
And just, I mean, it was a feast fit for a king or a queen.

[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:49.280]
And I want to tell you, it just doesn't get any better than bones in every Wednesday night.

[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:54.960]
They have fish fry night, all white fish fillets, batter dipped and served with fries, coalslaw,

[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.160]
and homemade tartar sauce.

[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.240]
All you can eat fish only, $6.95 every Wednesday night.

[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:04.720]
No matter what you're in a mood for, whether it's ribs or sandwiches, seafood, chicken,

[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.740]
country dinners, they got it all with all the fixings, all the down home cornpone fixings

[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.300]
at bones in Boka.

[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.980]
And we invite you to stop by for lunch or dinner any day of the week at 3,500 North Federal

[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.540]
Highway in Boka, mile and a half north of Glades Road.

[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.760]
Got a party coming up.

[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:20.740]
They do great catering.

[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.240]
And if you tell them that Neil Rogers sent you by, they will give you something special

[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:25.860]
at bones.

[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:32.160]
Something special for your Michael Jackson archaeologist collection at bones in Boka.

[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.440]
Are you there?

[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.160]
Okay, hold on.

[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:35.720]
Oh, good.

[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:36.420]
Is it on a line?

[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.080]
Can we put it in here?

[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:38.660]
Oh, that's good.

[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.280]
If it's on 187, I can't wait.

[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:41.480]
Hello.

[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.360]
Hello.

[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:44.520]
Wait a minute.

[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:44.980]
Wait a minute.

[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.320]
What kind of crap was that?

[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.380]
Yeah, what was that?

[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.220]
Why is he mad?

[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.160]
I can't put that on here.

[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:52.620]
He used words we can't say.

[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.880]
I sound like any Murphy.

[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.360]
Did, didn't it?

[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.280]
What's his problem?

[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.720]
You didn't call him it.

[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.580]
Well, he was pretty, uh, certainly funny in here.

[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.960]
Yeah, once we got him on the air, he wasn't so funny.

[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:06.860]
Yeah, too bad.

[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.160]
There was some potential there.

[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.040]
And he went a little crazy.

[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.020]
A little crazy.

[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.760]
And you're right.

[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.600]
It sounded like the soundtrack from Waw, Eddie Murphy.

[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.540]
I think I'm going to get my furniture in pieces.

[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.160]
I thought it was okay.

[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:22.780]
Maybe, right.

[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.220]
Maybe on the wall.

[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.360]
I'm coming to warehouse back again, because if that was really the truck driver,

[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.940]
I'm going to be churned all of this furniture, okay?

[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.060]
I'm serious.

[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.500]
If that was really the truck driver.

[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.760]
Yeah, this is Zeta again, okay?

[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:35.340]
Neo-Rodgers?

[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:35.860]
Yeah.

[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.300]
Now, did you hear, are you people listening over there?

[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:39.820]
Hold on a minute.

[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.560]
Let me make sure I'm listening to Hopper.

[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.360]
Yeah, now we just had a guy called here who said he was the truck driver.

[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:44.460]
I got it.

[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.560]
Neo-Rodgers again.

[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.080]
Yeah, who said he was the truck driver.

[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.220]
He's using all kind of four letter words on the air.

[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.080]
Then I had a dump out.

[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.660]
That wasn't that couldn't do.

[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.160]
That wasn't.

[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.420]
That was either ready Murphy or the truck driver or any other.

[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:56.240]
That was the driver.

[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.200]
That was the driver?

[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.020]
Yeah, he's a...

[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.280]
I had a little hyper this morning.

[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:00.900]
I had some coffee.

[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.020]
Yeah, that was...

[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:02.960]
He had some coffee.

[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.700]
That was the driver that just called here and used all those four letter words

[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.060]
that I had a dump off the air.

[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.380]
No, I don't think so.

[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.420]
I don't think he knows your number.

[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:11.880]
Oh, he doesn't know.

[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.380]
No, he couldn't.

[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:12.820]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.760]
Is the driver black?

[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.660]
No, he's white.

[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:17.480]
He's white.

[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.200]
No, that wasn't him in that one.

[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.340]
What was Eddie Murphy that called?

[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.400]
Eddie Murphy?

[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:21.860]
Yeah.

[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.500]
I have Eddie Murphy called here.

[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.460]
Okay, we'll see if we can arrange it for him.

[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.160]
We'll have him repeat what he said to us, okay?

[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.140]
Okay.

[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:28.820]
All right.

[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.700]
Have a good day now.

[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.720]
Bye-bye.

[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.400]
He was saying he was either going to put things he had boring from now.

[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.460]
We'll just call Levin's warehouse.

[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.320]
All right, keep that number.

[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.600]
He was saying he was going to put things on.

[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.720]
He couldn't believe anything, you know?

[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.440]
If the guy called and said it was...

[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.640]
Oh, no, I figured that it wasn't him.

[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.200]
Was that the same guy you talked to before?

[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:47.800]
No, but the guy was funny.

[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.280]
In other words, he had the truck driver call before.

[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.440]
It was the real truck driver.

[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.300]
And he assumes that between then and now the truck driver

[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.020]
not only did it as a different person, but he changed color.

[00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:58.840]
But he was funny, man.

[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.160]
He changed race between the last time he called.

[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.060]
He was funny, so I said, well, hold on.

[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.140]
I'll give you a chance.

[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.240]
You had to start him.

[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.960]
And then he went crazy, man.

[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:07.940]
Yeah, I noticed.

[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.120]
Mm-hmm.

[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.240]
Boy.

[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:11.640]
Maniac.

[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.120]
Boy, these bagels are good, aren't they?

[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:13.720]
They sure are.

[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.460]
We got one thing going here.

[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.080]
All right, let's take some more calls now

[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.820]
because it's been a traumatic Friday.

[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.500]
Broward County, hello.

[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.880]
Calls now because it's been a...

[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.320]
Come on.

[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:23.020]
Hey, buddy.

[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.580]
Oh, get out of here.

[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.180]
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.020]
It was it!

[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:27.820]
Broward, hello.

[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:28.940]
Hey, how are you doing?

[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:29.960]
This is the truck driver.

[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.200]
Are we gonna have to connect all of your cable system

[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.080]
to get the furniture, or do you know mine, do you?

[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.280]
Go right ahead, believe me.

[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.980]
There's nothing on the cable anyway.

[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.200]
This is one of the original flaming weerie licker's calling.

[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.340]
I got a question for you.

[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:41.840]
Yes, sir.

[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.240]
By the way, we never got another letter from Susan Martin

[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.320]
as we could get this point.

[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.240]
She's out of material.

[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.100]
Maybe she died.

[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.480]
Oh, poor Susan.

[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.280]
Listen to flowers.

[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.180]
I'm a torque radio addict.

[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.220]
I gotta ask you this.

[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.840]
If you were an addict like me, and you were forced to listen

[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.740]
to torque radio in this market between 10 and 2 in the daytime.

[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.640]
I'd kill myself.

[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.500]
I'd kill myself, I really would.

[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.380]
I'd blow my brains out.

[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.920]
I mean, I have to tune into Sandy Payton.

[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.280]
Oh, come on.

[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.080]
You're not okay.

[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.680]
I mean, anybody that's that desperate.

[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.540]
Well, a while?

[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:14.100]
No.

[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.760]
I'm just saying, can't you give it a rest for four hours?

[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.040]
Can't you put some stuff on cassette and entertain your

[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.300]
and amuse yourself until Stan comes on?

[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.960]
Maybe record the Neil Rogers show and listen to it later.

[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:24.920]
Very good thinking.

[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:25.480]
Great idea.

[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.920]
I got a good idea for your show.

[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:27.800]
Okay.

[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.960]
I think that everybody that calls up in the month,

[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.460]
at first of all, do you record your shows?

[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:31.920]
Yeah.

[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.280]
I think they should, everybody that calls up should make a great attempt

[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.500]
at giving good phone and that you should take maybe the 10 best calls

[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.920]
and at the end of the month, play them back and have the audience go on.

[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.020]
Which one was the best and give a prize for it?

[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:45.720]
Mm-hmm.

[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:46.860]
Might be fun.

[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:47.580]
Mm-hmm.

[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.320]
Just a suggestion.

[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.520]
I think you ought to suggest it to Jay Michaels.

[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.780]
He wouldn't get any though.

[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.520]
That'd be the problem there.

[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.820]
Because he's got all those entertainers on it, showman.

[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.660]
He's got every group and every band and every club

[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.220]
and every Schmageghi that comes down to Pike Man.

[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:02.820]
It's incredible.

[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:03.780]
It puts me to sleep.

[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:04.800]
That show he did yesterday.

[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.240]
I want to tell you on a scale of minus infinity.

[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.960]
It was, it was, there no words to describe it.

[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.740]
We can't get you broke, you blood pressure going.

[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:13.300]
Okay.

[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.040]
Take care.

[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:14.740]
Have a good day.

[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:19.000]
Now, Dennis ever tell us is today the day the trends are coming out.

[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.400]
He was in here like a flash and then he disappeared.

[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.360]
Something else was on his mind.

[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:24.040]
Yeah.

[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.480]
I don't know what it is.

[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:26.700]
He didn't say.

[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.360]
I mean, don't, don't we get to know anything anymore?

[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.300]
Are we totally in the dark?

[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.420]
I thought that Mark Cune was a douchebag, but this rose, man.

[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.260]
We're just like, tow.

[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:35.560]

[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.340]
I like the screen.

[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.540]
And I voted yes.

[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.140]
I don't think he liked that.

[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.980]
I don't think he wants to hear that.

[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:41.020]
I don't think he wants to hear that.

[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.780]
Now, why is he voting on a Cooper City kids?

[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:43.500]
What happened?

[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.600]
What the hell have they got to do with Haysha?

[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:50.240]
All they do is show them to bring me a message and he's taking a poll on the Cooper City kids.

[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.700]
Oh, well, the poll was, should he let him in or not?

[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.100]
Yeah.

[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.660]
I don't even know if they really wanted in there.

[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.960]
You know, one thing about Stan, man, his originality on a scale of zero is, I don't know what it is.

[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.660]
I think his brains are fried or something.

[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.820]
I don't know, I'm no comment.

[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:04.900]
Just get in trouble.

[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.320]
Who had Stan.

[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.180]
But they're okay in my book.

[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:08.800]
I like him.

[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:09.660]
I bet you do.

[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.600]
Come on.

[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.940]
I think they're good for you.

[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.600]
They would be good for me, yeah.

[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.280]
No, I don't think they're the least that's right because I kind of see you like as a father figure.

[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.480]
Yeah, that's exactly you got it exactly right.

[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.900]
No, you're kind, you're generous.

[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.700]
And I hope they don't know what you got it made.

[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.140]
He does have it made.

[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:24.360]
No.

[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.580]
And I think you should have some control over him.

[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.400]
Over who?

[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.340]
Over big days.

[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.300]
Living there with you.

[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.360]
I should have some control over him.

[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.060]
Now, what does that mean?

[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.880]
You know, some amount of control over him as far as keeping him in line.

[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.060]
I keep him in line.

[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:38.480]
I know.

[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:39.840]
Martin O'Zee needs it, right?

[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.020]
Kids today.

[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.260]
He needs it?

[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.360]
Yeah, those guys had a lot of energy.

[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.880]
Why, what is it that he did that indicates?

[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:47.660]
He was great.

[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.260]
He was good.

[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.720]
He gave himself rather well.

[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:50.960]
I thought he did, yeah.

[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.340]
I thought he did too.

[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:53.880]
You weren't there all day.

[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.560]
No, we had to leave at one o'clock.

[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.160]
We weren't invited to the concert.

[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.020]
Did you want to go?

[00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:58.620]
No.

[00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.580]
I think so.

[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.740]
But they won't, they kept your way from there, huh?

[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.880]
I was a bit unorganized.

[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:04.940]
Yeah.

[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.760]
That's too bad.

[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.760]
I felt bad.

[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.720]
You know, I brought my friend with me.

[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.920]
And I was always telling about the large crowds.

[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.420]
You know, great it is and a lot of energy.

[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.140]
It's just great.

[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.400]
Not there.

[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:15.600]
Where is everybody?

[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.100]
I don't know.

[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:17.920]
Something's wrong here.

[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.320]
But I know they're over there.

[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.200]
I just followed me in time.

[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:25.220]
Now, the rumor bet is that this friend of yours that you were with, he's the person responsible

[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.920]
for turning you on to talk radio.

[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:28.200]
I know.

[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.560]
He doesn't like to admit it too often.

[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.040]
That's right, Glenn.

[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:33.560]
He does.

[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.080]
That's what I thought.

[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.020]
He made me sit down and listen to you, Neil.

[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.100]
I mean, I never listened to radio of any kind.

[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.260]
You know, I have used to listen to my cassette player.

[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.360]
But he made me sit down and now look at me.

[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.520]
And the rest is history.

[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.460]
And the rest is history.

[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.280]
Yeah, sure is.

[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.800]
History in my house, Sam.

[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.080]
Tell big day, I said happy birthday and enjoy your new house.

[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:55.940]
I sure will.

[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:56.280]
All right.

[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:57.240]
You guys have a great weekend.

[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:57.860]
You too.

[00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:58.820]
Bye-bye.

[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.500]
See, you just knew that line was something important.

[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.000]
God was trying to tell me something.

[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.500]
That's right.

[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.820]
And it was something important.

[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:08.620]
And I wouldn't listen.

[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.220]
I wouldn't listen.

[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.800]
Something vital.

[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.420]
And you wouldn't listen.

[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:20.360]
Just when you thought crap-cold records couldn't possibly be more tasteless.

[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:25.100]
An avar, April evening, an attainable clean.

[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.720]
I met this year accountant.

[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.320]
He the boat to Tadeesh moves.

[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:30.980]
That's right.

[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.500]
It's the cat-skilled cowboy himself.

[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.700]
Dr. Erving Paycheck singing the all-time greatest hits of Noshville.

[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.720]
You'll hear the accountant.

[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.460]
You gotta know how to feed him.

[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.460]
Know how to cheat him.

[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.680]
If you wanna live your good life.

[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.860]
Deeper seconds, say that book.

[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.440]
And who could forget this flavorful cut?

[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.880]
Looking for locks in all their own places.

[00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.480]
Looking for locks.

[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.660]
I'd buy by the cases.

[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.260]
Quality stuff.

[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:08.400]
Be sure there's no cases of bones or too much salt.

[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:15.080]
And no collection of old country music would be complete without Dr. Erving Paycheck's dietary classic.

[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.280]
I've a scotian.

[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.520]
Then kosher, bosn, cool.

[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:26.100]
Yes, crap-cold records proudly presents the all-time greatest hits of Noshville.

[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.000]
Those not Miami moves.

[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.160]
To order Noshville hits, dial 1-800-cups.

[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.960]
Let's buy Dr. Erving Paycheck.

[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:33.620]
Kosies.

[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.600]
Got those not Miami moves.

[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.600]
Yeah, please.

[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.060]
And the same to you, Irving.

[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.260]
It's 936 on Zad-E-4.

[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.220]
Uh-huh.

[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.040]
Boy, this...

[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.720]
We were going to log in.

[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.760]
We were singing a song and doing our thing for two, about a half an hour ago.

[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:51.080]
And all of a sudden, man, we got that one message on the screen, about nine o'clock.

[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:52.080]
Yeah.

[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.820]
And all hell broke loose here, you know?

[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.180]
Now, did we miss something?

[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.660]
Did Rose come by here and tell us about the numbers?

[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.700]
Are they coming out today?

[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.640]
I think I blinked out for a minute.

[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.400]
We must have missed out on that.

[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.100]
I'm positive that he responded to my question.

[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.900]
I need some aspirin.

[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:10.340]
Yeah.

[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.180]
I need some exedron extra strength at this point.

[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.620]
And if the truck driver's listening great, I hope you get a diary, okay?

[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.880]
Make sure you spell the name right.

[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.480]
And don't put down, you listen to Behealfer on the radio, okay?

[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.600]
Now, won't get the job done.

[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:29.060]
Now, can you picture going home and there's furniture all over the front lawn?

[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:29.340]
Yeah.

[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.260]
Like, dumb there.

[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.520]
I can imagine that.

[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.580]
Oh, sure.

[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:37.100]
Because you've got to understand the other part of the dilemma hasn't been solved yet.

[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.700]
And that is the person inside the house has got to respond when the bell ring.

[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.000]
Why don't you call right now?

[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.080]
You know that cart you have that you play when we reminisce about Lakeland?

[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.040]
You know that one?

[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:53.620]
Oh, okay.

[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:58.440]
I bleep that out because there are more than enough people got that number already, okay?

[00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.500]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.980]
I can't put that message on here.

[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:01.420]
Geez.

[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:02.920]
Oh, my God.

[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:03.580]
Uh oh.

[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.020]
I put, I put an ex rated message on his phone.

[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.400]
I can't put, oh, geez.

[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.020]
Thank God.

[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:09.620]
I remembered.

[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.040]
So how do I do this now?

[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:13.360]
Yeah.

[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.620]
We dumped the thing already and we're all God.

[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.760]
I can't, uh, you're in the dilemma.

[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.100]
Uh, isn't this something I can't call a house?

[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.760]
Now, surely if he rings a bell, knocks in the door, it will.

[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.200]
Someone will hear, right?

[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.040]
Don't call him.

[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.020]
Don't be so sure of that.

[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:30.360]
Okay.

[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.560]
It's a very big house.

[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:36.400]
It would be a real good excuse to say, well, I was sleeping and I didn't hear the bell.

[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:41.460]
Even though people, uh, some people do know that their stuff being delivered there today.

[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.180]
I've got a very traumatic day today.

[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:44.540]
All kinds of people coming today.

[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.200]
Well, what does they have the machine for if we sleep?

[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.440]
I got the bug spray man.

[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:47.840]
Did it what?

[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:50.540]
What does he have the machine on for if he's in there?

[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.080]
It seems like he'd have a distance.

[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.940]
Well, he gets a lot of important calls early in the day when I'm not there.

[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.180]
For example, okay.

[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.560]
It gets these twinkie calls in the morning, okay?

[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.700]
From people who ought to be in school, but aren't stuff like that.

[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:04.500]
See, there you go.

[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.820]
Rip and stand off again.

[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.440]
Twinkies, you know, I know.

[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.060]
This is a dilemma.

[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:09.440]
Yeah.

[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.740]
Now, what the hell do I do now?

[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:11.880]
Maybe you love it.

[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.760]
Because I don't have an answering machine on my line.

[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:13.960]
Yeah.

[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.040]
I don't have to leave early today.

[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:15.880]
Yeah.

[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:16.940]
Maybe I got to get home early.

[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.560]
We could leave about a quarter of, okay?

[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.280]
Or ten.

[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.840]
Because obviously they're not speaking to us.

[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.140]
These management people.

[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.480]
So put put along some.

[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:24.840]
We're in the dark.

[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:25.900]
Yeah.

[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.100]
Let's play in a God of divida.

[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:27.980]
We're in the dark.

[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:29.120]
Oh, he in the dark.

[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:32.500]
Or we could call him and have him run over in the dark.

[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.160]
Boy, my glad I didn't let that message go on it.

[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.560]
That would have been so you just can't imagine.

[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:41.700]
Yeah, because you had just dumped because I say, hi, you've reached Dave's phone and he's

[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.760]
busy doing and I mentioned a couple of things.

[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:48.740]
That was an inner just a little joke, but that would have been in other words.

[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.860]
Right now before six o'clock in the morning, we're going to probably put it in.

[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:58.380]
So anyway, hopefully he's wide awake and listening and having a great time and a furniture is

[00:34:58.380 --> 00:34:58.640]
coming.

[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.820]
Oh, do we have another call from Levitts from the driver?

[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.660]
Oh, hey, hold on a second.

[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.040]
We got to take a break before you take this call.

[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.520]
Who is it?

[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.240]
It's SNM.

[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.880]
Oh, now what the hell does he want?

[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:13.000]
I don't know, but maybe we can find out.

[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.320]
Maybe he can go over to my house and make sure the furniture is done.

[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.600]
But I'm maybe going to do something useful for once in a while.

[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.820]
20 before 10 on Zeta 4 and we'll come right back.

[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.760]
Palsister, please do space.

[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.660]
Mr. Po, it was way back in.

[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.260]
A.T.

[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:27.880]
Oh, yeah.

[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:31.000]
When we left something behind your drive.

[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.980]
There must be a better way.

[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.520]
Then always asking us to pay.

[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:43.060]
Don't raise the rates cause if you do.

[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.480]
I've got a pitfall.

[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.880]
You're lucky, will you?

[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:51.880]
You always keep me waiting Mr. Po's man.
