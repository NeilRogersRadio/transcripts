[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.520]
Yeah, I have the number for the sun sent.

[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.180]
I need to order so I can cancel it.

[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.140]
925 55 11.

[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.680]
Okay, I don't have it now.

[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.240]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.320]
No, that's not the right number.

[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.180]
That's the wrong number.

[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.860]
Oh, geez.

[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.120]
That was the sun Tatler number.

[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.300]
Oh, I think different.

[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.640]
I don't have it.

[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.500]
Oh, anyway, I do have to call information, you know.

[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.900]
Okay.

[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.960]
I have a number for aerospacemith.

[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.840]
I've never wrought my e-mail.

[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.260]
You call that yet?

[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.660]
No.

[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.940]
Okay, you want it?

[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.280]
Yeah.

[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.840]
Okay, it's 1-900-660-1-200.

[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.620]
Okay.

[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.080]
Great.

[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.600]
And Bird.

[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.340]
Yes, sir.

[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.540]
You're not a whim, just a whiff.

[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.040]
You're so kind.

[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.920]
You're so kind.

[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.660]
I'm glad you clarified that for yourself.

[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.660]
Oh, two things before I go.

[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.420]

[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.440]
It was terrible.

[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.780]
Okay, it's a 890.

[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.960]
They probably enjoyed it.

[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.520]
Not that was good.

[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.640]
890 and J4.

[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.700]
We have an open line of dates.

[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.600]
6209.

[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.660]
What?

[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.200]
6209.

[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.880]
6600.

[00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.200]
Boy, I'm getting really tongue-tied after that, huh?

[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.300]
Well, that was just for everyone on hold.

[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.080]
62009.

[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.620]
66009.

[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.440]
It's amazing how much of my material just sales by your brain and never even makes an impact.

[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.660]
Let me make sure that we were on delay.

[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.980]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.980]
Now, what do you mean make sure that we were on delay?

[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.420]
Yeah, we were.

[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.380]
What the hell is that all about?

[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.120]
Wouldn't that be quite an awakening?

[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.120]
What he said, we could let it go.

[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.680]
Now, what did you say?

[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.200]
He wouldn't have enjoyed it as much if I wouldn't have dumped it.

[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.780]
Now, what did you say that I missed?

[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.660]
What did you say?

[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.640]
No, no, we're not going to.

[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.640]
We only go forward on a show, not backwards.

[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.540]
We never go back.

[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.040]
Oh, the consultants.

[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.360]
Yeah, the freakout.

[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.680]
Exactly.

[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.600]
Our consultants would have a nervous breakdown.

[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.520]
It's like, but I did that on that record.

[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.300]
Didn't I with a guest who did I say that was I always do that.

[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.180]
Because I think it's nice for the audience to have some idea of who it was and what the name

[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.880]
of the record was just in case they don't know.

[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.540]
Pretty revolutionary.

[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.520]
It's like there are a lot of real young people listen to this show and they don't know from

[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.880]
sure the land of the guests who.

[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.420]
I know.

[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.660]
They like it, but they don't know what it is.

[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.720]
In my lifetime, there have been many of those experiences.

[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.180]
I liked it, but I wasn't sure what it was.

[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.580]
It's a 820 on Zeta 4 and we'll come right back.

[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.380]
23 after 8 on Zeta 4.

[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.400]
I want to thank our friends at the Tastreet Rotisserie for the 8,000 gallons of honey mustard

[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.680]
today.

[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.660]
I don't know what I'm pulling.

[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.260]
We're going to have some real wild weenie roasts, I guess, in the future.

[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.480]
Now, the exact stuff is too good to waste.

[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.920]
You got enough?

[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.140]
Wow, for this week anyway.

[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.740]
Now, in a couple of minutes, we're going to have, if Patty Murray is listening, then sure

[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.140]
she is.

[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.660]
We got something that's going to knock her socks off in just a second.

[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.760]
First, we got to take this long distance call on three.

[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.120]
Hello.

[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.240]
Hello, how you doing?

[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.660]
Pretty good.

[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.380]
Where you calling from?

[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.760]
I'm calling from Pompo-no-Beats.

[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.120]
Alright, calling long distance from Pompo-no-Beats on the day line.

[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.140]
Yeah, well, I can never get through on the Broward line.

[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.160]
Yeah, well, when you're in Pompo-no-Beats, you got to start calling when you're young because

[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.520]
you age very quickly up there.

[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.600]
No joke, man.

[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.540]
You know all those blue hair.

[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.100]
Yeah, I love the way they drive up there.

[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.360]
Well, I'm telling you, they just put it in reverse and just let it coast.

[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.440]
Especially in Winnmore Village in Coconut Creek.

[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.800]
Yeah.

[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.780]
You could see them.

[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.020]
I have seen them, believe me.

[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.920]
Have you seen the Century Villageers out in West Bokka?

[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.360]
No, in West Bokka, why bec't you that's dangerous?

[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.400]
Yeah, about two months ago, a guy drove through a pool, through a pool area, and took two people

[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.420]
with him and killed him both.

[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.120]
Terrific.

[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.300]
Well, he was taking a little shortcut.

[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.900]
You know?

[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.880]
No joke.

[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.480]
You want to take a couple with him, right?

[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.820]
Right.

[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.740]
Alright, I called because you said they're going to pass this code book in Broward County.

[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.840]
That's what it says, yeah.

[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.060]
Yeah, well, they passed this code book in Palm Beach County schools three years ago.

[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.360]
Yeah.

[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.160]
Alright, if you have a water gun, they suspend you for three days.

[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.720]
Wow.

[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.800]
Alright, if you have a packet cigarette, you get O.R., which is the opportunity room, which is in-house suspension.

[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.960]
Opportunity room, but that's a, isn't that a cute way of putting it, yeah.

[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.900]
And plus, all the schools are fenced in.

[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.520]
All the high schools are fenced in.

[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.000]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.520]
Alright, and you cannot even think about getting near the fence.

[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.260]
Yeah, I think.

[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.120]
That's somebody getting near.

[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.800]
We had a call from one of the principals up in Palm Beach County.

[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.460]
What was in the Heinrich Himmler call this?

[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.720]
Oh, really?

[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.220]

[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.660]
I mean, you could hear Nancy said after singing in the background, these boots are made for

[00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.920]
water.

[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.100]
I'm telling you, it was dangerous.

[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.220]
But I went to Boko High.

[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.600]
Yeah.

[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.160]
Alright, and Dr. Johnson came in in my first year, okay, and the school was in fence

[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.660]
then there.

[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.840]
Yeah.

[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.980]
And within like a month, the school was fence then.

[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.860]
Oh, Dr. Johnson.

[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.740]
I remember his brother, Dr. Mengele, yeah.

[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.340]
Yeah.

[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.840]
Dr. Johnson was a guy, and he just put the word, a privilege in there.

[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.720]
Terrific.

[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.120]
You know, he got the school under the fence, this fence again.

[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.900]
Yeah, discipline.

[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.520]
I know what that's all about, yeah.

[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.520]
Yeah.

[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.860]
He wanted everybody under his phone, I guess, you know.

[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.700]
So to speak.

[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.680]
So to speak.

[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.780]
Well, Neil, I hope you all win a lot of money today.

[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.880]
I hope so, man.

[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.200]
I'll tell you if we do, we'll just share it with the audience tomorrow.

[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.000]
And birds, why don't you go live them?

[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.760]
Yeah, you ought to come out there.

[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.220]
Really?

[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.740]
Your public would be awaiting you out there.

[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.140]
They'd be just delirious.

[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.940]
Yeah, right.

[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:46.680]
No big deal.

[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.580]
I'm telling you.

[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.860]
Well, I don't have a good time.

[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.360]
Okay.

[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.840]
Hey, take care, Neil.

[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.360]
You too.

[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.060]
All right, hey, if you all need anything delivered, call Olympic delivery service in Boka.

[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.260]
Okay, and say hi to Dr. Mengele for us.

[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.040]
All right, feel it.

[00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.420]
Am I?

[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.600]
826 on Zeta Ford.

[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.700]
In fact, yeah, part of the new discipline code in Broward County.

[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.240]
That says no heavy leather, no whips and chains, only the faculty.

[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.560]
Can't bring the whips and chains.

[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.480]
Now, this is a little recording we did yesterday at Teravella High up in the Pearl Springs.

[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.620]
Okay, now it was a little lecture from lunch break.

[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.580]
It's 27 after 8.

[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.200]
And what a town this is, huh?

[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.120]
Isn't it great to live in almost America?

[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.560]
I mean, we're closer.

[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.620]
We're like a stones throw from the states here.

[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.460]
We're almost close enough to get there by bus.

[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.800]
What is he doing?

[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.880]
What is he doing?

[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.220]
Under your own reading the paper.

[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.440]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.600]
If he starts getting to learn how to read the racing form, you don't, you think it's bad now.

[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.640]
You'll never get him involved in this show, man.

[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.020]
He'll have that form in there every morning scouring, getting the scratches and just going out of his mind.

[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.900]
What's the scratch?

[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.480]
Don't tell him, okay?

[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.220]
Oh, God.

[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.220]
Don't even tell him.

[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.400]
Yeah, next you'll want to know about first time in Lasix horses, okay?

[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.220]
I don't encourage him.

[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.300]
I was just talking to Ron Harrison from last year.

[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:19.500]
And he just had some guy on his show that is a DJ in Baltimore who refuses to get off the air until the Orioles win a game.

[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.680]
And he's been on the radio for like 50 something hours.

[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.800]
And I was just...

[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.580]
He was on for a long time.

[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:32.140]
Now they're playing Milwaukee again tonight and then they have a day off and then they're playing Kansas City starting Friday through Sunday.

[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.800]
What a weekend.

[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.260]
Where are they playing Kansas City?

[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.060]
At Kansas City.

[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.080]
Oh, on the road.

[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.600]
So they probably won't win them.

[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.000]
So this guy's going to be on maybe for like the whole season.

[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.320]
Great.

[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.160]
Another month.

[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.680]
It's 828 on Zeta 4-year marathon station.

[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.380]
Why don't we do something like that?

[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.000]
Yeah, for our Major League Baseball team, okay?

[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.960]
Well, now I think this is great.

[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.560]
I got an idea.

[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.880]
Why don't we just stay on here till we get our Major League game?

[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.960]
I don't know.

[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.080]
I'll be on the air forever.

[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.880]
We'll have to send our bets over to Calder.

[00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.500]
Now, come on, you guys.

[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.180]
Those birds made history.

[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.200]
And you guys are making fun of them, you know?

[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.160]
I mean, come on.

[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.620]
So anyway, it's 829 on Zeta 4.

[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.360]
If you're wondering about that, we did have the ball scores here someplace.

[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.060]
Let's see.

[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:13.960]
Is this them?

[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.260]
This is them.

[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.780]
Wow.

[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.820]
What's terrible about that?

[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.940]
And then Milwaukee beat them.

[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.360]
Them, their birds, eight to six of Baltimore's lost 14th in a row.

[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.640]
The worst start in the history of Major League Baseball.

[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.080]
And there's no end in sight.

[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.280]
No immediate end in sight.

[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.600]
Cleveland beat Texas 2-1 and 10 innings.

[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.060]
The Yankees beat the twin 7-6.

[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.820]
Seattle beat the White Sox 5-4.

[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.240]
Oakland 9-8.

[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:35.980]
That was a good day.

[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.560]
Toronto shut out Kansas City 3-2.

[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.360]
Zip Boston, a detroit was rained out.

[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:39.940]
Maybe.

[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.220]
And the National League was Montreal 5-1.

[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.480]
Pittsburgh beat St. Louis A to 1.

[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.540]
The buckos are just sizzling.

[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.400]
They sure are.

[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.720]
They are down in that iron city by the Gallon in Pittsburgh.

[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.840]
Metz beat Philadelphia 6-2.

[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.480]
Giants beat the Reds 5-3.

[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.260]
Houston shut out the wonderful braves.

[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.800]
One to nothing.

[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.400]
San Diego Los Angeles was rained out.

[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.160]
Stanley Cup hockey Boston 4-0.

[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:01.840]
Montreal 3.

[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.660]
And New Jersey Devils beat Washington 5-2.

[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.240]
Both those series taught up in a game of peace.

[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.380]
Okay?

[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:07.980]
Okay.

[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.160]
830 on Zeta 4.

[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.360]
And a call from Beautiful Miami B.

[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:11.760]
Chelo.

[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.080]
Hello, Neil. How are you?

[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:13.400]
Okay?

[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.600]
I like the way you put that Mr.

[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.900]
Crior on the spot there.

[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.060]
Yeah, that's the town Crior.

[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.420]
That was great.

[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.800]
I was wondering if you could do me a favor.

[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.660]
Oh, now this isn't a request.

[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.720]
Oh, no request.

[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.440]
Okay.

[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.520]
I'd like you to call my attorney Barry at douchebag.

[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.440]
Hey, Barry, you're a subhuman piece of mong and a douchebag.

[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.220]
One more thing, Neil.

[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:36.260]
Yes.

[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.360]
Is he one of those lawyers in love?

[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.660]
Why am I going to change what?

[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.260]
A brick-to-b and pizza commercial.

[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.560]
No, they love that one, Bill.

[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:43.940]
I don't know.

[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:44.780]
Let's get anymore.

[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.500]
Yeah, but that's a classic.

[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.960]
Kyle is still with us in spirit.

[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.760]
He's in the building.

[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.680]
His surreliness still kind of like a hangover

[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.740]
to show like a cloud.

[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.440]
He's still around.

[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.440]
I love you.

[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.100]
You're the best.

[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:57.780]
I know it.

[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.400]
The best.

[00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.020]
I know.

[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.160]
The best today called a break a right.

[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:01.780]
Thanks a lot.

[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.240]
No, don't worry about the cashier and the box up there.

[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:05.640]
Okay.

[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.240]
Okay.

[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:06.720]
See you later.

[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.120]
Hey, you're not supposed to break a leg when you talk about horse racing.

[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:09.760]
You're not?

[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.700]
When you're doing a play.

[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.440]
If you go into a play or you start a new business, break a leg is good.

[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.780]
But when you're talking about horse racing, it's, gee.

[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.540]
It's just not the kind of thing you say because then your horse kind of isn't too anxious to get in the starting gate.

[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.040]
Really?

[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.180]
Hey, 31 on Zeta 4, your horse and around station.

[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.180]
Yeah, I'm psyched.

[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.560]
I want that racing form right now to hell with all of this.

[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:30.840]
Okay.

[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.360]
We got an hour and 40 minutes to go.

[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.280]
Yeah, you could probably.

[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.320]
I bet you somebody in this audience has got access to a racing form for today called it.

[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:44.700]
Seriously, they probably would have guys have we talked about the fact that there are so few new stands in a town.

[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.500]
That's right down the street.

[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:52.020]
Seriously, haven't we talked about that fact many times that there are so few new stands in this area because this is not a place where we're going to be.

[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.200]
Where people even read.

[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.160]
What are you trying to say?

[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.020]
What are you trying to say?

[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.980]
You have to find a good news stand where they carry the racing form.

[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.800]
That this community doesn't need newspapers because of the literacy.

[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.640]
Probably not.

[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.260]
Look at me.

[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.980]
I don't even get any newspaper anymore since I came on FM and became totally illiterate.

[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.240]
I know you were one of the only, why you heard you talk about on the air one time.

[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:15.300]
You were the only other person I knew in South Florida that got the Washington Post delivered to their house.

[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.120]
And the New York Times.

[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.760]
And the hair old once upon a time in a slum sentinel and the news.

[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.700]
And I just used to get on time in Newsweek and US News and the summer Easter.

[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.080]
The New York Times, the Nation and all of that crap man.

[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:27.680]
What a newspaper.

[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.400]
I know.

[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.160]
So anyway, although I will say this, the Times has got the world's worst sports section.

[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.000]
So if there's anybody, oh god.

[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.060]
But that's, you know, that's not their metgea.

[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.140]
I mean, there's still pretty redsmiths column.

[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.580]
I mean, he died like two years ago.

[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.700]
Most incredible newspaper in the country.

[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.460]
Yeah, it's the most awesome news.

[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.120]
The most terrible sports section.

[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.380]
Well, forget it then.

[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.000]
Now I've got speaking and newspapers.

[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.700]
I got that article I was telling you about from two days ago.

[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.220]
So no wonder we don't get it anymore.

[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:53.800]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.780]
You know what I almost forgot?

[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.420]
Before you do that, I got that something special for Patty Murray coming up right here.

[00:10:59.460 --> 00:10:59.660]
Yeah.

[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:00.460]
Great.

[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.340]
Here we have Mr. Roy Robinson.

[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.880]
I remember this.

[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:11.860]
Three of sure.

[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.020]
I remember when you were a friend.

[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.120]
And I got the impression you love that.

[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:18.800]

[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.700]
To go better and find the better.

[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.980]
You go better with hope.

[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.040]
You're in my wrongful state.

[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.940]
So I'm sending you.

[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.040]
And everything you do is like this.

[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.580]
No matter where it's going to come out.

[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.540]
You're better with hope.

[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.060]
Oh, my best partner when you're real.

[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.280]
And comfort fresh.

[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.080]
You're better with hope.

[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:54.720]
Yeah.

[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.900]
It is up in the room.

[00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.160]
I got cold to call everybody.

[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.700]
And it's right to get close to the table.

[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.540]
Nobody can do it.

[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.160]
You know, it's just great.

[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.320]
Don't accept anything but a coke now.

[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.960]
Coke, a coke is so great.

[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:06.460]
Right.

[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.300]
That is frightening.

[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.500]
Now, you notice the record.

[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:10.860]
Okay.

[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.520]
Pretty woman.

[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.520]
Now, do you think that David Lee Roth would record a coke

[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.960]
a cola spot if they paid him enough?

[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.180]
Oh, she.

[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.120]
But they're not asking.

[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:20.940]
You notice the difference.

[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.140]
Oh, they're not asking.

[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.220]
Uh-huh.

[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.560]
Because even soft drink companies don't want to be connected

[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.700]
with some limparasted, strange, bizarre creatures.

[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.520]
Wait a second.

[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.440]
Like David Lee Roth.

[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.240]
What about Pepsi?

[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.200]
Why do you think I just said that?

[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.760]
Jesus, he's slow, huh?

[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.420]
Well, I thought you were, you know, a little.

[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.960]
He just doesn't understand the show at all.

[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.220]
I can't tell you.

[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.240]
You're so good at being.

[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.500]
Look at the laminate of my Pepsi machine.

[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:45.720]
Straight forward.

[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.720]
26 till 9 on 24.

[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:48.500]
You are just.

[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.800]
You guys don't even pay any.

[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.680]
You don't even understand what this show is about.

[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:52.700]
And you're part of it.

[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.840]
That's the frightening thing.

[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.440]
Well, what is it about?

[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:55.840]
I don't know.

[00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.400]
It's like the Reagan administration.

[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.540]
So anyway, what were you about to say there before we got?

[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.640]
Oh, Roy Orbison Intention again for Patty Murray,

[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.620]
that fat bitch.

[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.040]
That what I was saying a couple of days ago in this article.

[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:06.420]
Where's it?

[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:06.620]
No way.

[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.120]
Is it fanfits or dumbass?

[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.360]
I think both.

[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.120]
Come on.

[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:10.540]
Come on.

[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.020]
Go ahead.

[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.620]
They're talking about writing humor.

[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.640]
And he says when a funny piece comes off,

[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.220]
it flies as close to heaven as a writer is likely to get.

[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.560]
At the moment, my candidate for the funniest writer in America

[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.940]
is Dave Barry of the Miami H.

[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.540]
Oh, Jesus.

[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.260]
When he is good and he is good almost all the time,

[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.240]
he is hilarious.

[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:29.880]
Who wrote this?

[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:30.700]
Mike Spindell?

[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.940]
No, this is a national lyrics.

[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.720]
This is a national article.

[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.280]
Yeah, right.

[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.700]
James J. Curl Patrick.

[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.340]
This is his universal press syndicate article that he has in the paper every day.

[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:40.700]
Yeah.

[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.020]
He relies on wild exaggerations of the familiar circumstance

[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.640]
and he pulls them off superbly.

[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.000]
Yeah.

[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.480]
And he compares them to art in bookwad.

[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.800]
Oh, he compares them to art bookwad.

[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:54.860]
And, um,

[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:55.760]
Get serious.

[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.120]
Mark Twain.

[00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.800]
Yeah, Mark Twain.

[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:01.880]
And the Wheel Rogers.

[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.560]
Oh, God.

[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.400]
Maybe Wheel Rogers, okay?

[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:06.480]
Yeah.

[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.580]
Do you think maybe Wheel Rogers is in your ancestry?

[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.840]
Yeah, he's in my family tree.

[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.940]
In fact, we tried to shoot him out of the tree the last night in the backyard.

[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.120]
24 till 9 on Zeta 4 and we'll come back after this.

[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.880]
839 on Zeta 4, the New Yorker's Thursday show.

[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.360]
And how much you want to bet about this mobile caller still be online?

[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.040]
Okay, the odds are 4 to 1.

[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:28.640]
He's gone.

[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.480]
Is he gone?

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.840]
Yeah.

[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.380]
Okay, so we have an open line in date now where that douchebag in the mobile disappeared.

[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.680]
620, 3600.

[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.640]
That's 620, 3600.

[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.500]
Hey kids, what a embarrassed major world powers and dredge of 40 years of horrible memories?

[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.040]
Yeah.

[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.500]
Then you want the new Clouse Barbie doll.

[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.960]
Every Clouse Barbie doll comes wrapped in its own miniature bulletproof witness day.

[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:59.140]
Imagine the hours of fun you'll have cross examining your very own Clouse Barbie.

[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.500]
Come on, fake up strutal brain.

[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:07.060]
The new Clouse Barbie doll comes complete with brown shirt, stormtrooper boots, fake ID and passport.

[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.160]
Kurt Wolthandall sold separately.

[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.020]
All right.

[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.820]
Clouse Barbie, you can tell he's much snow, he's hell.

[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.620]
Okay, a little something special here for the members of the Brown County School Board.

[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:19.420]
And...

[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.200]
Okay.

[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:30.800]
Here's the highlight of the morning ladies and gentlemen, something that Captain Dave I know has been waiting for with Bated Gret.

[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.340]
I'm serious.

[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.520]
The only thing we did in there was like, what?

[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:35.600]
Why not?

[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.560]
Let's try it.

[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.380]
That attitude that re-gold over this album.

[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.020]
Well, we were locked into it.

[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.260]
We were in that room that was it.

[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.140]
It was like four five and a bit long.

[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:49.520]
No, it was doing the track for the percussion track for chrominification.

[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.000]

[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.860]
There was like three or four of five of us and we went right in there with Bruce and we all played different stuff.

[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.740]
So all the time we just set up some mics in there.

[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.360]
Oh, it was from the internet.

[00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:58.780]

[00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:58.900]
Yeah.

[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.460]
Anyway, the thousandth great thing about it was that we had the song type before we went in that we could...

[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.200]
We couldn't know where at the point.

[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.580]
We couldn't go...

[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.120]
Wait a minute, what did he say?

[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.040]
Oh boy, you were able to answer that.

[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:12.740]
Bullseye.

[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.660]
Yeah, okay.

[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.580]
Well, listen, that's great.

[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.580]
That's deep time, man.

[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.860]
That was Erosmith.

[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.400]
That was that 900.

[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.300]
That's the 900-erosmith line, you know?

[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.780]
Unfortunately, we had to delete some of the expletives from their conversation.

[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.940]
Now, it's a rock band.

[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.540]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.160]
They have a different lingo precisely.

[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.920]
So anyway, it's 18-dilana and Zeta 4.

[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:40.040]
We're sorry that we can't play Erosmith on the show anymore, but Captain Dave is absolutely sanded in his...

[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.760]
The big minute is verboten, he will not permit it.

[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:44.620]
Perboten.

[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:50.720]
And he's going to start giving us bogus tips on these horses if we play it one more time, okay?

[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.700]
He doesn't want to threaten us already, but...

[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:55.440]
Yeah, boy.

[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:56.060]
Yeah.

[00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.540]
You have got things to do today and I know what's going to happen.

[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.040]
Just like yesterday, I was supposed to go to the gym.

[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.300]
Oh, you're not going out there today?

[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:03.600]
Okay.

[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.920]
Well, I might just give you like a bundle of money.

[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.880]
Oh, no, no, no, don't put any responsibility on me.

[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.400]
Okay, I'm not going to get involved in this.

[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.600]
Don't lay that trip on you.

[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.120]
See, it's not the same people, they'll say here, here's 10 bucks, put them on the one that the guy said.

[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:16.260]
Yeah.

[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.120]
But it's not the same.

[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.960]
Because when you're there, you're looking at the odds down the last one.

[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.880]
Of course, absolutely.

[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.160]
It's just like these guys that want to go out there and bet, you know, you can go and bet all the races and leave.

[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.440]
Okay, you can bet ahead.

[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:26.840]
Sure.

[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.560]
But you have no idea what the odds are going to be or what, you know, perfect is or...

[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.620]
Yeah, the perfect is to what's going on, okay?

[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:38.660]
And that jerk, if he's listening, that it said zero minutes, the horses are entering the gate.

[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:44.300]
And there's this guy, he's got one of those geeky pencil holders in his pocket with about 40 pencils and pens.

[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.800]
He's got his binoculars and he's up in front of me and even the lady.

[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.440]
He's betting everything that's been betting every race.

[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.440]
It was like the third race.

[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.080]
He was betting all the way to the tenth race and there was no time left in all these people.

[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.340]
And it's real considerate going up to the window with about a minute to post time,

[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.320]
which at Calder means about four minutes to post.

[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.900]
And going up there with a minute to post and betting, you know, ahead.

[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:04.380]
Yeah.

[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.640]
Why not do it between the races one, you know, like when the race ends and there's 22 minutes to post,

[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.400]
for the next race, when nobody is betting, there's nobody online, you can take your time.

[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.560]
But not somebody's never on to think of the only...

[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.440]
It's like these other guys that go to the window and they're betting 8,000 different combinations.

[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.320]
And the horses are getting into the gate and you're still starting to breathe heavy.

[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.640]
And everybody's having an nervous breakdown and I always get in that line.

[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.420]
It never failed.

[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.020]
Even the lady was getting niffed.

[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:31.400]
Yeah.

[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.480]
I got his one douchebag yesterday.

[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.200]
He's like numbers and numbers and numbers and the guys give him his chain.

[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.500]
And then he's got more numbers and you know, like get it over with already.

[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.220]
Get up there and know what you're doing and get the hell out of there, okay?

[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.760]
And make room for the real plungers.

[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.960]
It's 844, it's 844.

[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.560]
He started talking about it.

[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.400]
I'm so glad you got that off your chest.

[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.180]
I really am.

[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.440]
I really worked up about it.

[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:54.760]
Okay.

[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.180]
Mike, how are you doing?

[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:56.860]
How are you?

[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.180]
Well, actually, I'm not good at all.

[00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.060]
Wow, what's wrong, Mike?

[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.480]
I just did my taxes today.

[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.840]
You just did them today?

[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.280]
Well, I don't like to wait till last minute or anything.

[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:04.800]
I say.

[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:05.220]
Yeah.

[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.320]
That's a good day to do.

[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:10.160]
We're tracing Mike's number and now I owe him $1,400.

[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.140]
Oh, that's really tough, Mike.

[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.380]
Oh, well, what can I say?

[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:13.880]
That's what I get.

[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.120]
Well, you go on to the track today.

[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.360]
You can make that in a double.

[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.460]
I really should.

[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.060]
I really should.

[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.960]
I mean, I'm already what?

[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:19.780]
$1,400 in the hole.

[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:20.200]
What's another?

[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:20.780]
Exactly.

[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:21.340]
What's another?

[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.960]
What's another two, three grand, right?

[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.660]
Yeah, I can't believe you're getting shine like you are now Captain Dave's talking.

[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.720]
Yeah, Bob's not going.

[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.740]
Captain Dave is going.

[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.600]
I know the burden spite of all his rum.

[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.820]
He's not going back on the hell.

[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:32.860]
What?

[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.400]
I said, we should, all your listeners should go.

[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.340]
Yeah, good luck to you.

[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:36.620]
Yeah.

[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.180]
And if you think I'm giving you any tips, good luck.

[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:39.760]
I don't doubt.

[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:40.540]
I don't doubt.

[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.960]
I have a question for a bird.

[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:43.680]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.960]
How come at seven o'clock the temperature was 664 and at eight o'clock it was 63?

[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:48.980]
I don't know.

[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.600]
You know, you're going to have to deal with the National Weather Service in Coral Gables about that.

[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.100]
That was the official Miami temperature.

[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:55.820]

[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.800]
I went and got it and that happened sometimes.

[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.860]
You know, we've switched times.

[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.360]
You know, we're on daylight savings time.

[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:01.820]
Right.

[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.060]
So seven o'clock is really six o'clock.

[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:04.820]
I'm fine with it.

[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.520]
See, that's why it goes down sometimes.

[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.600]
It gets a little bit cooler.

[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.020]
Huh.

[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.120]
Even even when the sun is shining and it's like it looks like it's about 90, right?

[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.520]
Now it was seven o'clock.

[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:14.900]
Uh-huh.

[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.880]
And the sun was shining.

[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:16.800]
Just.

[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.580]
Yeah, maybe in the like in case you hit the bed somewhere the sun is shining.

[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.420]
But anyway, no, I checked that, sir.

[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.580]
And I appreciate you checking, you know, following up on me.

[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.960]
But that was the official temperature.

[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.440]
So if you have a complaint, uh, call the National Weather Service.

[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.060]
I just wanted to let you know that people are listening to you when you do the weather.

[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:34.480]
Okay.

[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.360]
That's good.

[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:35.700]
Yeah.

[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:36.180]

[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.000]
Yeah.

[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:37.320]
Yeah.

[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.500]
You put the four-large on news.

[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:39.880]
What's that?

[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:44.100]
Uh, I get the paper every day just to do the crossword puzzle because I don't bother reading that crap they put in there.

[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:44.380]
Yeah.

[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.740]
And they sent the same paper two days in a row.

[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.180]
And I already did that crossword puzzle.

[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.420]
And I was pretty upset.

[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.480]
I don't blame you.

[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.000]
I don't either.

[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:57.820]
The thing that I love is that if you get the sun sentinel and the four-large on news, there are several pages that are the same.

[00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:58.500]
Several?

[00:20:58.820 --> 00:20:59.040]
Yeah.

[00:20:59.220 --> 00:20:59.740]
How about most?

[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.860]
Yeah. Most of the paper is the same paper.

[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:02.240]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.200]
So I'm going to call them and cancel my transcript.

[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.240]
Well, I think you should.

[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.660]
I'll get a crossword puzzle book.

[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.780]
Exactly. There you go.

[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:09.180]
Yeah.

[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.020]
Yeah.

[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.260]
Or just stay on an airplane all day long.

[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.680]
You know, you can fill out those, uh, those eastern things.

[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.960]
All right. You have a good day today.

[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:16.500]
You too.

[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:16.800]
All right.

[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.300]
Bye-bye.

[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.660]
Well, it looks like I'm going out there all by myself.

[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:20.920]
It does look that way, then.

[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.320]
But I just find a nice little corner on it.

[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.960]
Well, now you got your mustard, though.

[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.480]
You got your line going out there alone.

[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.240]
I'll be honest with you.

[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.120]
You get your find a nice little corner and hide.

[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.700]
You got your big tub with you.

[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:30.560]
Yeah, my mustard.

[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:31.140]

[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.200]
You're all set.

[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.020]
847 on Zagathur.

[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.600]
See, I would call Bill Calder and invite him to come out there, too, but no.

[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.720]
But the thing that irritates me about him is when we get a tip, he won't bet it.

[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.880]
Because anything that I bet on, he won't bet on it.

[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.700]
That's, that's a true story.

[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.800]
Like all these winners that we've been given last few days, it would be pointless for me to say,

[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.900]
Hey, let's go out and give him those horses because he just won't bet on him.

[00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:00.620]
I mean, somebody could, like I remember last year, Mike Gonzalez, one day said to us,

[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.400]
he really liked the horse.

[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.800]
The horse was called Alias Burman.

[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.500]
And it was the first time starter and it came in one easy and paid like $8.

[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.320]
And I had it.

[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.080]
I didn't bet a lot.

[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.200]
I think I had 30, 40 bucks on it, something like that.

[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.880]
And a horse one paid $8, which is not bad, okay?

[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.380]
And he didn't bet it.

[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:20.800]
And a jockey tells him that he likes the horse and he thinks he got a good shot.

[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:21.960]
And he won't bet it.

[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.100]
Let's see, bullheaded.

[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.220]
He just one of those stubborn mules, okay?

[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.420]
What is his one is Delray Beach and Orioles fan.

[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.920]
Well, we'll take it a little out of order because they deserve some help.

[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:37.340]
Hello.

[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:38.860]
Hey, good morning.

[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:39.860]
Good luck to you, sir.

[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.620]
Well, come on, I'm a pirate fan and an Orioles.

[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.180]
Oh, okay.

[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.340]
So half a loaf is better than unright and not only that, but there's something to be said for perfection.

[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.540]
Well, that's true.

[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.080]
I began in the season.

[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.160]
I thought I was going to have two losers instead of Pirates of Dune.

[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.020]
Pirates are hot as a pistol, aren't they?

[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:56.580]
That's right.

[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.340]
But the O's have set a major league record.

[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:58.740]
That's right.

[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.080]
And listen, all in 162 would be a Mark Dough in last for a long time.

[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.780]
They're going to make the playoffs yet.

[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:05.640]
Yeah, right.

[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:10.480]
We're going to have the worst start, make the playoffs and everybody will be gone.

[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:11.320]
Mm-hmm.

[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.060]
Good luck to him.

[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.080]
I like to see the braves and the O's in the series, man.

[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.240]
That would electrify me.

[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.140]
I don't know.

[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.320]
All right, Neil.

[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.440]
I just want to say good morning.

[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.580]
It's the first time I've ever called.

[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:22.940]
Okay.

[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.080]
How long is it going to be before Earl Weaver is back?

[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.380]
Hopefully before the end of the year.

[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:27.980]
Okay.

[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.560]
Or maybe Rick Weaver.

[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:31.300]
Earl.

[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:31.900]
Okay.

[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.540]
Good luck to you.

[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:32.900]
I'm out.

[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:33.320]
Good bye.

[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:34.760]
Yeah.

[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.280]
That would be interesting.

[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.240]
And we can bring back some of those great players of the past, you know, like Johnny Meyers and...

[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:41.260]
Johnny?

[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:41.780]
Yeah.

[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.360]
Babe Ruth, Roger Maris.

[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.120]
I got a little...

[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:45.640]
Lou Gehrig.

[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.080]
A little trivia.

[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.300]
Over Cleveland, Alexander.

[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.200]
Walter Johnson.

[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.500]
I bet you don't know this.

[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:52.500]
Hey, listen, why not?

[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.060]
I mean, the Orioles are playing like they're dead.

[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.520]
So I want to bring back some dead players.

[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:55.980]
Yeah.

[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:01.520]
The Dodgers and the Phillies are the only two teams that haven't been called for a buck this season.

[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.360]
Isn't that amazing?

[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.560]
That is pretty exciting.

[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.220]
I knew that.

[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:05.700]
Did you?

[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.080]
Yeah.

[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:09.020]
Well, yeah.

[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.220]
I think that was coming up on the news.

[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.180]
I think you just...

[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.080]
Yeah, it's good.

[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.260]
You still has thunder.

[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.040]
Damn it.

[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:14.580]
Damn it.

[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.720]
I guess you have to put some other stories in there this hour.

[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.880]
Well, we'll see if we can...

[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.140]
Oh, my God.

[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.300]
And we get some dizzy DNA item or something.

[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:22.620]

[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:23.200]
Or Jeffy.

[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:28.960]
A TV reporter who set out to prove how easy it is for New York voters to cheat finds

[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.100]
yourself the target of a possible inquiry.

[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:36.940]
Barbara Nevens from WCBS TV in New York says she was able to register to vote in all five

[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.640]
New York City burrows Tuesday, though she voted in only one.

[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:45.820]
Election officials' vast authorities to prosecute her for lying on her registration

[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:46.540]
forms.

[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.560]
But the big story of the day is that Larry King's book is out.

[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.040]
Talked to Larry King.

[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:52.800]
What's it going on?

[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:53.340]
It's called...

[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:53.680]
It's called...

[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.060]
It's called Tell It To The King.

[00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:03.880]
And they had a party yesterday in Washington in his honor.

[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.760]
Joe Grasiela was there.

[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:06.720]
Joe Don Giola.

[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.320]
Ralph Nader.

[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.980]
And his best friend Frank Zanajan.

[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.540]
Robert Strauss, Kitty Kelly were all there to celebrate.

[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.300]
It was that car line.

[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.600]
It was the Watergate apartment overlooking the Potomac and hosted by New York Governor Mario

[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.360]
Como.

[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.320]
Como.

[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.680]
Perry's brother, you know, Como.

[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:26.480]
Now some of the stories in the book Larry tells about Lawrence Olivier who King never

[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.140]
did interview and he was originally to play the lead in the Godfather.

[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:30.860]
But he became...

[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:31.740]
Who's that Larry King?

[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.480]
Larry Olivier.

[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.820]
And he ended so up to like checkpoints.

[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.600]
And he became actually what happened was Olivier became ill and the part went to Brando.

[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.080]
And by the way, King says that Brando's best friend was Wally Cox.

[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.160]
I don't know if you knew that.

[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.980]
That's what it means to be roommates in the 50s.

[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:46.500]
Yeah, what?

[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.800]
Marl and Brando Wally Cox shared an apartment in the mid 50s.

[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.280]
No, now wait a minute.

[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.200]
That really raises a lot of...

[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.740]
That net serious question is about Wally Cox.

[00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.460]
Also the stories in the book about Cuomo turning down King's offer to arrange a meeting

[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:02.520]
with Angie Dickinson.

[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.880]
And it says that's King's one time companion.

[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.900]
What do you mean they used to be roommates in this?

[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.220]
Marl and Brando.

[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.300]
Marl and Mr. Peeper.

[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.380]
And Mr. Peeper.

[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.660]
I wonder what he was peepin' at.

[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.100]
And...

[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.440]
Marl and made him an offer we couldn't refuse.

[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.620]
One other story in the book of interest about Cuomo's star.

[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.520]
Marl and Mr. Wally Cox.

[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.100]
Cuomo's star, Marl and Chambers.

[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:28.600]
Oh yeah.

[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:33.640]
Who once offered to have sex with King during a commercial, then talked about it on the air.

[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.020]
She stripped to nothing but a gold chain but they didn't do it.

[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.760]
Just...much in that passing.

[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.220]
Also what does it say?

[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.080]
I wasn't at the show when he had the heart attack on him.

[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:43.840]
What does he say?

[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:49.040]
Hi to Chris Everett who has announced last night that she will marry former Olympic ski team member,

[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:49.500]
Andy Mill.

[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.880]
That'll be July 30th at Boko Polo Club and it will be her second marriage.

[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.060]
Wally Cox and Marl and Brando.

[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.420]
Partly sunny today.

[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:03.580]
I will be 85 and tonight's low 68 and despite what that guy said, it's 64 now.

[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.420]
What do you want to do tonight, Marley?

[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.900]
Edwin Ho, let's go see Mr. Papers.

[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.100]
I think we need a break after that newscast.

[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.000]
He's devastating isn't it?

[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.400]
Here it is, Zeta 4.

[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.080]
We're in shock.

[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.420]
It's 852.

[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.700]
I heard him say it my headphones.

[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.960]
I am in a steady shock.

[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.360]
Yeah, like I have not seen you in in a long time.

[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.160]
This is in mono.

[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.880]
Well, you know, maybe appropriate today.

[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.700]
Well, the element of surprise is gone.

[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.580]
Oh, no, no.

[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.140]
That's good.

[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:42.700]
You all right?

[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:47.960]
Before we get back to that, the story about the Arabs running their horses on the beach or whatever it is,

[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:54.640]
it says, if approved, the races would be run on a stretch of beach between 5th and 15th streets on Ocean Drive.

[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.540]
An estimated 2600 Arabian horses would participate.

[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:03.380]
The races have met with some opposition from area residents who don't want to smell the horses.

[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.740]
I always say in my good friend, Wally Cox.

[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:16.260]
You always used to be like in a setter square right in the middle, you know what I mean?

[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.240]
He was like the middle man on that show.

[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.420]
He used to sit on the same seat with Atmaniac Paul Wind.

[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.540]
I do think there was a coincidence there.

[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.120]
What about what? He was on the bottom left.

[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.580]
Oh, he was on Charlie Weaver used to be.

[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.560]
Yeah, wasn't he?

[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.180]
Oh, wasn't.

[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.080]
Charlie Bear.

[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.720]
Yeah, that's a bad square to sit in.

[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.060]
Now Paul Wind was in the setter.

[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.600]
And Tony Field used to sit in there too.

[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.000]
Jim Morrison sat there.

[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:41.700]
Jimmy Hendrix.

[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.800]
John Kennedy used to sit on that one.

[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:45.440]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.620]
Rutherford Behays sat there once.

[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.500]
And President William Henry Harrison once sat in that square too.

[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.800]
And he started it all, I think, by sneezing and...

[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:53.960]
Yeah.

[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:59.880]
And I'm trying to think about, you know, where Wally was in the square.

[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.820]
It wasn't at the bottom left or am I wrong?

[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.980]
It's my favorite song, Jeepers Creepers, honey-like-them-peppers.

[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.420]
Room mates.

[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:15.260]
What the hell does that mean?

[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:17.600]
What does that mean?

[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.940]
Paul Wind was in the setter square.

[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.060]
Dummy, come on, get with it.

[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.580]
Paul Wind was in the center.

[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.320]
Oh, he was.

[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.820]
No, he was not always in the center.

[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:28.460]
What in the long?

[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:33.680]
After Wally Cox died Paul Wind switched into the center square.

[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:34.140]
Oh, I see.

[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.560]
What did he do?

[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.260]
He switched it.

[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.960]
He said, I'd rather switch than fight.

[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.220]
858 on Zeta 4, you are Marlon Brando intensive dish.

[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.160]
Hey, you are in shock.

[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.160]
I am just apoplectic.

[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:47.980]
I can't handle it.

[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.600]
I am going to go alone to the track and find my little corner there

[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.500]
and go and sit there and contemplate my navel for many hours.

[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.960]
I just, Wally Cox and Marlon Brando, some other just...

[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:58.820]
But I mean, can you...

[00:29:58.820 --> 00:29:59.400]
You know what that's like?

[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.260]
That's kind of like James Dean and Orson Welles, you know?

[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.760]
It just doesn't...

[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.020]
You can't envision it, you know?

[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.380]
Now, can you have...

[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.620]
It's like Tony Dow and Oprah Winfrey.

[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.320]
You know what they're called?

[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.040]
You can't conjure that up in your mind.

[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.920]
John Wayne and Truman Capoei.

[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.320]
Yeah, John Wayne and Luke Helping.

[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:19.580]
You know, it just...

[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.240]
I don't know.

[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.680]
Now, can you imagine what a different film that would have been with Lawrence Olivier in the Marlon Brando role?

[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.000]
How different that would have been?

[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.620]
That would have been Wally Cox in the Marlon Brando role.

[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.280]
You can make you know for your key refuse.

[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.180]
Now, there's a thought.

[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.120]
Yeah, that would have been pretty exciting, wasn't it?

[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:41.200]
Now, there was another one I heard that...

[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.640]
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf was originally for James Mason.

[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.560]
And oh, God, I forget who the woman was and they gave it to each other.

[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.940]
And somebody like that.

[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.400]
And they gave it to Richard and Liz.

[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.520]
These things always seemed to sort of take care of themselves.

[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.720]
Oh, I am just absolutely apoplectic.

[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.640]
WG2A, Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and the Palm Beach's.

[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:08.140]
Good morning. It's the Neil Rogers show on say to four.

[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:09.620]
Wow, you can say that again, Lé.

[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.000]
On a clock on say to four.

[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.640]
Another good roommate, rumor, was Rick James'.

[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.000]
Sure. Rick James?

[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.640]
The disco rock singer.

[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:23.520]
Oh, yeah.

[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:28.060]
And he and Neil Young used to be roommates together in the 60s.

[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.260]
Wow. That's exciting.

[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.260]
So anyway.

[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.340]
And we'll have more roommate rumors tomorrow.

[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.280]
Oh, yeah. That's going to be our subject tomorrow.

[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.060]
It's going to be roommates.

[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.860]
So get your roommate all propped up and ready to go.

[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.080]
All right.

[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.440]
And tomorrow we'll want a full report.

[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.100]
OK, let's go back to the calls here.

[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.000]
Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.480]
Neil. Yeah.

[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.580]
I've got your form here.

[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.520]
You're my what?

[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.040]
I've got your form here in my hand.

[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:51.620]
What do you want to know?

[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.760]
You got the racing form?

[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.180]
Well, no, I can't if I discuss it on the air.

[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.280]
Then I'm going to give away the horses that we got.

[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.260]
Well, you could dump it.

[00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:59.280]
No, I can't do that.

[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.560]
No, I see this guy wants to know who we got today.

[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:02.740]
That's for real.

[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:03.800]
I can't do it. I don't doubt.

[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:04.920]
No, OK.

[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.140]
No doubt about it.

[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:06.740]
Because we got there.

[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.740]
One of the horses we had yesterday is still running.

[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.040]
So I don't want to do that to you.

[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.100]
I saw you when you got out there for the second yesterday

[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.180]
with your three bodyguards.

[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:15.560]
Yeah.

[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.220]
Now we had a good day.

[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.220]
We were doing a lot of caching.

[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.220]
I haven't cached that much.

[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.140]
All last season I didn't cached that much.

[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:21.500]
Yeah.

[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.660]
We need to do a big day of the lighter.

[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:24.960]
Yeah, he's.

[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.020]
But when I keep bumping the matches off people.

[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:30.000]
I know he was driving everybody nuts and bumping lights

[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.580]
from everybody.

[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.240]
Well, at least he gave me something to do.

[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:34.000]
In the final stretch.

[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.840]
I probably see you out there today.

[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:36.820]
OK, good luck.

[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:37.260]
OK.

[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.480]
Oh, he's he's ready.

[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.140]
And I like you guys got nine in the morning.

[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.220]
He's got the racing form.

[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.300]
And he's he's studying and he is ready to go.

[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.320]
You know, there were some fans of the morning.

[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.600]
So there that we ran into.

[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:48.880]
Yeah.

[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:49.860]
Oh, they're always are.

[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.260]
By the way, I wonder how well now what's that guy that sits inside

[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.280]
Ernie?

[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.040]
I wonder if Ernie is still out there.

[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.320]
Oh, it's a searchin.

[00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:58.300]
Not Ernie so.

[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.080]
You know, what about that call we never did yet?

[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:01.780]
You remember that guy?

[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:02.680]
He said he doesn't believe.

[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.340]
And he just hung up and that was the end of the call.

[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.180]
What a disappointment.

[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.680]
We get a lot of those, you know, when they think that that's funnier.

[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:08.260]
It's not.

[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.040]
It's like a anti anti-climactic.

[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:11.480]
Yeah.

[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:16.720]
And so anyway, it's two minutes after nine and we're just counting the moments.

[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.020]
No, so don't bother us.

[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:19.680]
Miami.

[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:20.100]
Hello.

[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:20.560]
Hi.

[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.820]
When are you going to the races today?

[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:25.940]
When am I going?

[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.420]
Oh, here's another one of these callers.

[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:29.940]
I'm going to the itinerary.

[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:30.480]
Well, let's see.

[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.800]
I don't know.

[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.620]
I probably invite you to my office at the race track.

[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:35.560]
Your office?

[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.980]
Yeah, we have on the editor of the racing report.

[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.120]
I don't know if he's heard of it.

[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:40.440]
No.

[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.140]
Okay, we do a daily racing result show from Calder.

[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:45.580]
Wow.

[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.040]
It's on the Funtanet Lake and save it.

[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:48.420]
That one.

[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.160]
Is it really?

[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:49.680]
Yeah.

[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:50.980]
What time is it on?

[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.320]
It's on every nine six thirty eleven thirty.

[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:53.740]
Great.

[00:33:54.820 --> 00:34:01.120]
So in other words, if I went out there and bet early, which I'd really do, but if I went out there and bet early and left, then I could get the results.

[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.460]
Yeah, that's what the show is designed to do.

[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:03.960]
Exactly.

[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.060]
That's great.

[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:09.720]
Well, what I want to do is I want to invite you up to our studio and just show you our other things suite in the studio.

[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:10.860]
Now, where are you?

[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.320]
I don't know if I'll make it today, but if not, I'll make it some other day soon.

[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.040]
Where are you located?

[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.220]
Well, you know when you go in the Valle parking?

[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:17.940]
I sure do.

[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.100]
Okay, and then if you were to turn left or the elevator.

[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:20.600]
Right.

[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:21.180]
Exactly.

[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:24.200]
Okay, you would make a right, actually, in the stairs.

[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.140]
You just go up a half a spread of stairs.

[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.360]
And we're right there in between the first and second floor.

[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:31.300]
Wait a minute.

[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.580]
You take the elevator somewhere?

[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.180]
No, no.

[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.960]
And then I'm going left to the elevator.

[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.160]
Oh, I see you make a right.

[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:36.480]
Right.

[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:37.340]
You go to stairs.

[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.280]
And you know how it's like split level.

[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:39.680]
Yeah.

[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:42.740]
There's two offices there before you make it to the second floor.

[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:43.540]
I got you.

[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:44.320]
I saw a realtor.

[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:44.800]
Great.

[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.000]
And what's your first name?

[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:46.460]
Lilian.

[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.120]
Lilian.

[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.840]
And then the post-production supervisor.

[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:49.580]
Okay.

[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:52.100]
Well, if I can't get out there today, I'll will soon, Lilian.

[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.740]
Are you going to be at the Roof Garden?

[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.800]
Oh, I'll be there, yeah.

[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:55.960]
What are you going to be wearing?

[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.700]
I'll spot you in the out and I'll come in.

[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.300]
Well, let's see.

[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:05.000]
It's Thursday, so I have my green shirt on and black pants and my glasses and my shoes.

[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.560]
I've seen the host of our show used to work with you at Wynn.

[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.220]
Who's that?

[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:10.100]
Jeff DeForest.

[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.600]
Oh, Jeff DeForest.

[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:12.000]
Yeah.

[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:12.620]
Sure.

[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.800]
He's down on the Roof Garden too, all right.

[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:15.980]
Well, I saw him try to jump.

[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:16.380]
Yes, dude.

[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.660]
I can't believe it.

[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.380]
Tom, not to get so emotional, okay?

[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.460]
I've got a lot of money here.

[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.240]
Did he?

[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.440]
Didn't say that was vice versa.

[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.120]
No, that's good.

[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.320]
Did he really win a lot of money?

[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.040]
I want to see him.

[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:25.980]
Wow.

[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.320]
All right.

[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.280]
I do with all my own with actually their tickets since I don't bet.

[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:31.780]
Yeah.

[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:37.200]
Because we have a cabinet and inside the cabinet, I post all the losing tickets and I want you

[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.240]
to know that that keynote does not cover.

[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:41.300]
Nah, we wouldn't imagine, yeah.

[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.600]
I have a vote my wall has.

[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:43.740]
Maybe today it will win $100.

[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.360]
Now, why do you just want to see, say hi?

[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.360]
You might have even a bigger day today.

[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:47.960]
You might win $100.

[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:48.840]
Yeah.

[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:50.000]
That's what.

[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:50.580]
Okay.

[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:51.820]
See you later.

[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.220]
Bye-bye.

[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:53.220]
Okay.

[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:53.920]
How about that?

[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.820]
We got a whole bunch of degenerates out there, right?

[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:59.200]
We should just have a big degenerate party up there today.

[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.400]
I thought, what do you mean we didn't need to say a while ago that he's got all this stuff

[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:03.600]
today?

[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.500]
I said, I did my work.

[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.540]
I said, you're not going to be there.

[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.040]
I did not.

[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:08.960]
Yes, I did.

[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.840]
I said, I've got so many things to do today, but I know what's going to happen just like yesterday.

[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:16.980]
I canceled out on some important things I was supposed to do and I was up there gambling

[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:17.220]
now.

[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:18.880]
This is the first sign, isn't it?

[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:19.160]
Yeah.

[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.320]
Got obligations.

[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.620]
He's got things he's got to do.

[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.440]
And he just decided to be coming irresponsible.

[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.320]
I think what's the number for GA?

[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:25.800]
Okay.

[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:26.120]
Yeah.

[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.580]
What's that gamblers anonymous?

[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.300]
Don't take it that seriously.

[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.540]
Don't take it that seriously.

[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.620]
You should see this maniac screaming.

[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.760]
Come on, Lister, you son of a come on.

[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.380]
And that was even before they rang the bell.

[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.480]
And they weren't even in the starting.

[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:43.080]
He's getting like, Ernie, I was speaking about Ernie before before I was so rudely interrupted.

[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.980]
Ernie is one of the great all-time characters.

[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.520]
Don't you remember me talking about Ernie who wears those Argyle socks and the.

[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:49.680]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:50.460]
Sure.

[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:51.620]
And the sits up their heat.

[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.840]
Now he's like in the stands in the grandstand.

[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:54.360]
Mm-hmm.

[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:58.900]
And I used to stop by and sit in front of Ernie and we just have some wild times over there together.

[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.320]
And Ernie is pretty good handicap.

[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.000]
And he's got all the, oh man, he's got the red pen.

[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.120]
He's got all the numbers written down.

[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.500]
Every time the odds change, he writes it in his program.

[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.740]
And he's just a wild man.

[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.420]
Now see, that's a little good.

[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.620]
And he'll sit there and the horse is before they go to the gate.

[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:13.700]
Now this goes times when.
