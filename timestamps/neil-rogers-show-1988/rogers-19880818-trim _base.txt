[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940]
Oh, that's good.

[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.080]
It's the golf game.

[00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.840]
It's called G-O-F.

[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.940]
The G-O-F at the golf game.

[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.440]
Are you locations in the Bay Area?

[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.020]
Five.

[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.460]
Wow.

[00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.080]
But we don't have time to get into the Bay Area in Atlanta.

[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.460]
I think there's two of these two.

[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.820]
Now it's your turn.

[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.740]
Well, speaking of food, it appears slicing pizza has an occupation.

[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.560]
That's correct.

[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.120]
This is shocking, don't you think?

[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.900]
This is shocking.

[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.220]
A hazard other than the one posed by sharp blades.

[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.380]
In a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine,

[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.060]
they always keep up on stuff like this.

[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.160]
You bet.

[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.620]
A doctor describes a case of what he calls pizza cutters paulsing.

[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.540]
The doctor says, are you suffering from this?

[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.280]
The doctor says a weakness of the hand muscles

[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.980]
comes from pressing the handle

[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.620]
of a roller blade pizza cutter into the palm.

[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.540]
Among other things.

[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.660]
Don't you think this is what Wendy was suffering from this morning instead of the pizza cutter's paulsing?

[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.900]

[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.660]
His prescription for relief is simple.

[00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.460]
Don't do it.

[00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.020]
Exactly.

[00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.240]
Stop.

[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.020]
Use another kind of cutting.

[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.320]
Everything will be fine.

[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.960]
Now what was that again?

[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.880]
You go to the doctor and say, every time you go in,

[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.180]
you know, that old little, uh,

[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.960]
Hintey Youngman joke, you go in the doctor and you say,

[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.260]
doctor, it hurts when I do this.

[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.100]
And the doctor says, well, don't do it.

[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.900]
And see, in this case,

[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.920]
it turned out to be fact.

[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.080]
Unbelievable.

[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.700]
It's 9.23 now.

[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.760]
And what are we going to play the music?

[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]
We ought to play this next.

[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.040]
We'll play Tainted Love for you right after this.

[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.500]
Neil Rogers, The Rock and Roll Monster.

[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.920]
Zeta Ford, boy, that sounded great.

[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.420]
Soft Cell with Tainted Love for you this morning.

[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.600]
That we just got today.

[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.300]
That of course is from January 82.

[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.080]
And is the record that's meant the longest time of any single in the history of Billboard's Charge.

[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.480]
43 weeks on the chart.

[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.740]
And it only went incredibly to number eight, Cap and Dave.

[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.560]
Only went to number eight.

[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.360]
And there it is.

[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.720]
It's there from Britain, Soft Cell.

[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.700]
Of course, as we mentioned earlier,

[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.320]
the song that was chosen by Rolling Stones,

[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.560]
the number one single for the past 20 years,

[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.400]
which is...

[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.440]
That is fact, it's stolen, wrongs, man.

[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.320]
That's a good song.

[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.200]
That is a good song.

[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.420]
And that's one of my favorite oldies of all time.

[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.280]
That's coming out in the next edition, the top 100 singles of the past 20 years.

[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.680]
Wow.

[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.040]
We have another first time caller this morning.

[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.220]
This person is in Hollywood.

[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.680]
Hello.

[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.540]
Hello.

[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.220]
You're a first time caller.

[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.540]
Yeah, I think I'm your youngest loyal Zeta listener too.

[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.600]
I want to have a content.

[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.840]
How old are you?

[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.540]
I'm 20.

[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.840]
Is that...

[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.280]
Is that...

[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.040]
No, no.

[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.960]
We hear from teenagers.

[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.580]
Oh, yeah.

[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.220]
Oh, sure.

[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.340]
And then also people love to put their kids on the phone.

[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.640]
We've had some of that this week.

[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.660]
Three-year-olds and eight-year-olds, you know?

[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.800]
Oh, shucks.

[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.640]
Yeah, but...

[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.660]
Oh, well, well, I can say that...

[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.860]
I like Zeta a lot.

[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.180]
Well, why do you think it's unusual that your age should be listening?

[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.320]
I don't know.

[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.780]
I know a lot of people that are 20 years old

[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.580]
that are listening to...

[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.540]
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.020]
Yeah, I know.

[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.380]
I know.

[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.780]
And our research shows that a lot of women also,

[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.760]
in your age group, 18 to 24, listen to gloves and joy and stuff like that.

[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.200]
That's Serpy saccharine music for some odd reason.

[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.520]
You notice some of your girlfriends doing that?

[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.760]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.760]
Yeah, a lot of them that are like, yeah, they're 20s.

[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.960]
Yeah, why is that?

[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.240]
So you know what that makes people think about...

[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.380]
You know, the stereotypical thought is that your airheads.

[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.260]
Mm-hmm.

[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.020]
You don't want to hear any content.

[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.440]
All you want to hear is like mindless music, you know?

[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.160]
Not me.

[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.960]
I like Zeta.

[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.100]
Before you guys came along though, I listened to Waxy.

[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.740]
Uh-huh.

[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.640]
Boy, those guys, aren't they?

[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.860]
I know.

[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.340]
What you're not, you know.

[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.220]
They're awful.

[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.980]
Every minute you hear that cow going, baaah!

[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.720]
And I listened to them a couple of weeks ago when I was on vacation.

[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.960]
And they talk and talk and talk and talk and they never say one thing ever.

[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.340]
Never.

[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.920]
Babylon.

[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.180]
Just babble and talk like for hours.

[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.160]
And nothing has ever said.

[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.080]
Have you noticed that?

[00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.940]
Incredible.

[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.600]
Well, I'm glad to see you're an exception.

[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.200]
You figured it out.

[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.720]
You're listening.

[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.380]
That's great.

[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.660]
You should be congratulated.

[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.140]
I love Zeta though.

[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.580]
It's great.

[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.100]
Oh great.

[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.740]
Well, I'm so glad you called and spoke to us this morning.

[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.300]
Wait a minute.

[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.840]
Don't kick me off the...

[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.380]
Oh, I'm not.

[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.120]
I was wondering, when are you guys going to have a pink-floy weekend when you're going to have, you know, like you do the beetles?

[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.720]
Really?

[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.380]
I don't know.

[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.060]
I'll ask after the Archies weekend.

[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.300]
Yeah.

[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.040]
Johnny said right after we do the Archies for a weekend, you know.

[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.320]
Now I'll suggest it to our Pergon-Driver Rose Folcher.

[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.840]
Yeah.

[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.920]
Do you guys know Jack Lieberman?

[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.760]
Sure.

[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.320]
Yeah.

[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.700]
Just he a joke or what?

[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.260]
I think so, don't you?

[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.880]
Yeah.

[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.160]
I used to work for him.

[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.080]
Did you, really?

[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.260]
What a gas, right?

[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.740]
Wow.

[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.840]
When you were a teenager.

[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.980]
Yeah, I did.

[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.840]
But then recently, not too long ago, I worked for him.

[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.400]
So, I don't like that.

[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.720]
So, what do you do now?

[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.220]
Oh, I answer a phone.

[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.480]
Oh, well, somebody has to do that, you know.

[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.140]
It's important.

[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.860]
It's important, really.

[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.640]
I have too many though.

[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.420]
I verify credit cards.

[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.100]
Well, before I kick you out of here, why don't you say hi to Captain Dave?

[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.080]
Hi, Captain Dave.

[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.620]
Yeah.

[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.120]
Like you said, Kevin Dave.

[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.600]
Oh, no, Captain Dave.

[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.320]
They have to say it correctly.

[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.740]
You know, kind of have to sort of lumble it.

[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.280]
I've got to say it.

[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.460]
They kind of have to lumble it.

[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.460]

[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.680]
You know, we got this letter today, someone a photo request.

[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.960]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.960]
And it's addressed to Mr. Bird, Neil or Glenn.

[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.920]
He'll or Flynn.

[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.300]
Yeah.

[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.340]
And that's something.

[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.640]
Well, I'm serious when I'm very sincere when I tell you, I'm glad to have you as a listener.

[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.780]
Oh, see that.

[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.280]
All right.

[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.660]
It's one of the free Zeta shirts.

[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.220]
Should I do you a...

[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.540]
You want a free Zeta shirt?

[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.640]
I want a Zeta shirt.

[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.440]
You know what I drove around for a half an hour trying to find this place one day just to get a license plate.

[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.640]
Finally, one of my friends had an extra one and they gave it to me.

[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.820]
You couldn't find us?

[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.140]
No, well, you guys were going to be at some...

[00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.460]
Oh.

[00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.400]
...and or something.

[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.240]
I don't know what it was.

[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.620]
Yeah.

[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.760]
I don't drink, but I was going to go there just for the license plate.

[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.340]
Oh, yeah.

[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.520]
Well, hmm.

[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.200]
I have to think about it, okay?

[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.680]
Hey.

[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.560]
All right.

[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.180]
I don't know what to tell you.

[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.580]
I don't have any shirts with me right now.

[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.980]
Yeah, right.

[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.720]
I don't.

[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.860]
I'll be over there in about five bitters and hopping in my...

[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.620]
I honestly don't have one.

[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.480]
But if I did, what kind would you like?

[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.560]
I want one that just says, I love Zeta 4 on it.

[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.260]
Oh, a Zeta 4 shirt.

[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.420]
Well, we do have those.

[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.480]
We do have Zeta.

[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.060]
What did I say?

[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.080]
Oh, I was thinking about the unbelievable shirts.

[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.140]
Oh, no.

[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.580]
I have our pictures on.

[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.700]
I just want a regular Zeta 4 shirt.

[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.080]
Hmm.

[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.720]
Okay.

[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.740]
What should I tell our captain day?

[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.140]
I know you don't want to deal with this.

[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.500]
This show just grounds you with it.

[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.240]
Did it really?

[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.880]
Yes.

[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.080]
Oh, okay.

[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.460]
Sorry.

[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.320]
See you later.

[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.500]
Okay, bye.

[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.620]
Hey, I didn't realize that.

[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.720]
Well, this calls for you.

[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.100]
Hello?

[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.700]
Yeah.

[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.060]
Yeah, talk to Captain Dave.

[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.580]
Look, this is a rock and roll station here.

[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.560]
Now, don't play this computer,

[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.160]
an early 80s battle.

[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.060]
I was having one that we got rid of.

[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.720]
It was dead.

[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.580]
Now, who would you rather talk to Captain Dave?

[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.060]
The last lady or this caller?

[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.160]
At least this is interesting.

[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.960]
I think I was a little bit of touch and go to it.

[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.500]
Oh, okay.

[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.040]
He's out of his mind, but it's so cool.

[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.460]
He's showing for a t-shirt.

[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.020]
He's groveling for that.

[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.280]
Okay, well then you talk to him.

[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.000]
You deal with it.

[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.360]
No, don't get surly in all that.

[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.680]
That phone call was about three minutes too long.

[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.240]
That's all.

[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.900]
So what can we do for you?

[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.200]
Well, look.

[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.080]
You've got to play.

[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.320]
You know, I have to admit,

[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.800]
it is a step in the right direction.

[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.060]
At least it's not one of those tunes.

[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.520]
You just play over and over again until, you know,

[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.100]
the legs fall off of it.

[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.240]
Now, we told you why we played this record.

[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:44.780]
There was a purpose for it.

[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.920]
You don't hear that much.

[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.200]
That's number one, but also we played it

[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.180]
because it was, it had the longest longevity

[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.600]
of any record on billboard.

[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:52.620]
We thought it was a...

[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.920]
I just showed the stupidity of the American people.

[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.700]
Well, I don't judge the American people.

[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.460]
I, we reflect the American people.

[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.780]
Oh, Danny, then why don't you go work for

[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.260]
why I went under something?

[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.680]
I like why I went under.

[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.880]
Shoot them.

[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.240]
You deserve that, Jack.

[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.340]
Is that it?

[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.240]
It's called, I'm pretty long time.

[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:15.860]
I know.

[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.180]
Kind of grinding at home.

[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.400]
What you guys could do.

[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.920]
You know, there's a certain ban

[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.940]
that all the rock stations are too wimpy to play

[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.660]
and you guys could break new ground there.

[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.680]
What is there we go?

[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.640]
Living color.

[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.820]
Imagine if you put Jimmy Hendrix in Led Zeppelin

[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.640]
and you had a singer like, oh, it is writing on it.

[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.040]
God, you'd have culture clash.

[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:38.940]
That's, that's the total.

[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.420]
It's, they like, they can play three styles and...

[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.020]
Who is it?

[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.880]
Is that the group living color?

[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:44.820]
Yeah, living color.

[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.100]
The album's called, Vivid.

[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.220]
Well, I have to check it out.

[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.060]
I can produce it.

[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.040]
Yeah, well, maybe we'll check it out sometime.

[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:51.860]
All right.

[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:52.760]
Okay.

[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.120]
All right, later on.

[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.920]
Now, what was your other here?

[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.900]
Tainted Love, which was a smash or...

[00:08:58.900 --> 00:08:59.480]
What was the name of that?

[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.140]
Living color.

[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.700]
Yeah, I don't know what they sound like,

[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.680]
so I really couldn't say.

[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.740]
I'm gonna stick with the hits.

[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.840]
It was only on the chart for 43 weeks,

[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.620]
but I guess it's gonna be much.

[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.680]
Yeah, there was a reason that we played dead.

[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.520]
I still like...

[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.300]
Criticized.

[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:12.820]
You know, what?

[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.740]
That felt bad that we didn't have the long version.

[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.520]
Yeah, we were kind of...

[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.700]
You can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself.

[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:18.540]
That's right.

[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.480]
That's right, baby.

[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.800]
Well, this show, this has been a battle

[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.140]
like I have never been through.

[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.840]
It's 936.

[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.980]
We'll do this, and then we'll continue to slug it out.

[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.000]
Today at Noon Gonders' Grill, featuring blacks from Steve Winwood,

[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.900]
the Who, and the Rascals.

[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.460]
Tomorrow, Friday, it's all Request Led Zeppelin.

[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.180]
On Gonders' Grill at Noon, here on Zeta 4.

[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.620]
Now, Johnny tells us there are a lot of...

[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.820]
Well, this is an old one.

[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.460]
Today is the Led Zeppelin.

[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.080]
God, nice.

[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:44.400]
Geez.

[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.280]
Okay, start over.

[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.560]
This show has been...

[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.100]
I have never...

[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.740]
It's been amazing.

[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.920]
...through anything like this in my entire life.

[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.180]
Because you're in a different studio.

[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:58.260]
Not just that, but we had somebody who screwed up the spots today.

[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.620]
The spots are all screwed up just everything.

[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:00.940]

[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.400]
Everything normal now, but we, earlier this morning, it was a night.

[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.880]
You people have no idea what a nightmare we have been through today

[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.120]
to put this show together for you.

[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.700]
And if we're in here tomorrow, I'm going to say it again in public,

[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:11.700]
and I'm sticking with it.

[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.420]
I don't care.

[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.960]
Nobody's taking this personally.

[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.800]
If we're in here again tomorrow, it's going to be all music.

[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.040]
I'm not doing a show here again because they promised me.

[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.540]
Well, we do 16 in a row.

[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.780]
Yeah, we'll do 16 in a row tomorrow.

[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.700]
We'll do 16 billion in a row tomorrow.

[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:32.560]
They promised me we would be back in our studio so we could do the show.

[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.780]
What's it look like in there?

[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:34.940]
It's coming along.

[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.000]
They worked until two in the morning, Moon said.

[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.820]
So they're definitely working on this.

[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:39.920]
There are a lot of cigarette butts in here.

[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.840]
So some of them are doing the same thing.

[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:41.220]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.280]
We've got to give them incentive, or they won't get it ready.

[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.260]
You know how people are?

[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.660]
If we don't say anything, it won't be ready.

[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.200]
But they got to fix that noise, too.

[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.100]
Oh, I like this mic.

[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:50.640]
It's great.

[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.400]
But I mean, can we hear that other morning again?

[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:53.920]

[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.500]
Oh, you can hear the AM.

[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.540]
You can hear the AM, huh?

[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:00.600]
Oh, good.

[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.820]
We need to get the current temperature for it.

[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.120]
Here's another first time caller.

[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:05.980]
Hi, hello.

[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:06.560]
Good morning.

[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.280]
Good morning.

[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.020]
How come you never call?

[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.580]
Because I listen on and off.

[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.900]
I find this show.

[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.860]
I don't want to sound, you know, heretical.

[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.540]
But listening to Neil in the morning is like listening to Morton Downey Jr.

[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.200]
in the morning.

[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.000]
I mean, it just, it wipes me up too fast.

[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:24.580]
Mm-hmm.

[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.360]
Everybody complains, but everybody would miss a word.

[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.280]
Yes, that's right.

[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.920]
You just got to see what is going to come out of this man's mouth next.

[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:32.540]
Yes.

[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.360]
What could he possibly say next?

[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.700]
You love to hate him.

[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.120]
Yes.

[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.840]
And I have a couple of requests.

[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:38.620]
Oh.

[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.260]
And thank you for playing Tated Love.

[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.920]
I had never heard the full thing before where they go into where they don't love ghosts.

[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.680]
Didn't that great?

[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.400]
It is excellent.

[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:45.740]
Yeah.

[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:46.800]
I don't know what's happened to them.

[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.700]
They should have more hits.

[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.840]
I know that was the only one.

[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.240]
You're right, they should.

[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.520]
This is a long shot.

[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:57.220]
You guys in Neil's files, some where he had magic count by the folks.

[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.860]
I don't believe so.

[00:11:58.980 --> 00:11:59.760]
I've never seen that.

[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.980]
Nobody has it.

[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.060]
It's a beautiful one.

[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.380]
Nobody seems to have it.

[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.780]
Now, Johnny has it at home.

[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.260]
How about if we haven't bring it in, we'll play it for you tomorrow?

[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.500]
That would be great.

[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.120]
Would that be great?

[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.160]
I am always frustrated with any of the three major stations.

[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.320]
And you know who you are.

[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:22.240]
When you play the Golden Flumbrism mentally by the Beatles, I know you guys hate dead air.

[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.160]
But all three of you major people have been guilty of omitting the her majesty.

[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.500]
It's a pretty nice girl bit.

[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.640]
I thought it was about 10 seconds to dead air.

[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.640]
But still, that's excellent.

[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.360]
And I'd love to hear it.

[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:34.880]
Okay.

[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.440]
Now what time do you get up in the morning?

[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.760]
Oh, usually about 6.30.

[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.180]
Okay.

[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.380]
Well, we'll play Magic Town for you tomorrow about then.

[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:40.680]
Okay.

[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:41.300]
Thank you.

[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.540]
Maybe you can wake up to it.

[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.220]
Play it like 6.35 for you.

[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:44.480]
Okay.

[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.220]
Thanks for calling.

[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:45.980]
Thanks, bye bye.

[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:46.400]
Bye bye.

[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:47.920]
North Miami.

[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:49.140]
Hello.

[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.640]
Now they're there.

[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.720]
I know they're there.

[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.880]
Get to 1 in 6.

[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:54.460]
Okay.

[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.060]
Hi.

[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:56.840]
Hello.

[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:57.660]
Yes.

[00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:58.440]
Yeah.

[00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.740]
Well, I liked that song.

[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:00.320]
Did you?

[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.680]
Did you remember it?

[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.720]
Yeah, from when I was in seventh grade.

[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.420]
I remember everybody loved it back then.

[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.960]
I really liked it back then.

[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.500]
I haven't heard it since I was in sixth grade.

[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.580]
That's why we played it.

[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.460]
That was the two reasons we played it.

[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.440]
Because nobody plays it.

[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.520]
And because it was the longest record in history on Billboard.

[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.280]
Well, I'm 17 now.

[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.840]
I must have been like 10 then.

[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:25.860]
Yeah.

[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:26.020]

[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.680]
It was really, I liked it then a lot.

[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.340]
But I was running if you could play rock-sea music.

[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.480]
Do you have rock-sea music?

[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.660]
Oh, boy.

[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:34.480]
I don't know.

[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.880]
I just don't know.

[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.700]
You know, we're not in our usual situation.

[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:38.240]
I don't know.

[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.140]
I'll see if we can check it out for you.

[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.320]
You know that song more than this.

[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.520]
Oh, is that great?

[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.800]
Yeah, it's a great song.

[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.400]
Great record.

[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:45.260]

[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.400]
Well, let's show you a look up rock-sea music in the book.

[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.740]
Oh, they didn't do anything, but it's a great song.

[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:51.220]

[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.100]
We'll see if we can do it for you maybe tomorrow.

[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.900]
Well, how about some more music from that age?

[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.880]
From that period.

[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:58.280]
Yeah.

[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.040]
Well, we'll see what we can do.

[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:00.640]
Okay.

[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.440]
Thank you.

[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.300]
Good to hear from you.

[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:02.860]
Okay.

[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:03.360]
Bye-bye.

[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.400]
So, we've got a plantation now.

[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:05.740]
Hello.

[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:05.820]
Hello.

[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:06.960]
Plenty.

[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.920]
Five minutes after 8 o'clock on Dave's a preta.

[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.100]
Joe Johnson is here.

[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:10.960]
Wow.

[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.000]
I can't believe that.

[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:12.520]
Good.

[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.380]
That's like 60 years ago.

[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.100]
Now, you know, we're doing a lot of reminiscing this week.

[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:21.120]
A lot of playing stuff in the past, and that one went back further than anything, I think.

[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.280]
Boy, was that a great call?

[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.440]
That would be a heart style.

[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.180]
There's always somebody out there taping, isn't it?

[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:25.660]
We're in liquid.

[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.100]
It is.

[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.180]
It's frightening, yeah.

[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:28.980]
Now, this call is Fort Lauderdale.

[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:29.260]
Hello.

[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:29.840]
Hi.

[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:30.260]
Hi.

[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.040]
How are you?

[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:31.360]
Good.

[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.200]
I feel really redundant now, but I call to say I have a vote for Tainted Love.

[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.840]
She likes Tainted Love.

[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:38.400]
Very much.

[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:38.940]
Yeah.

[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.000]
Wouldn't it great to hear it again?

[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:40.620]
It was.

[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.800]
Like you say, you don't hear it very much.

[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.180]
Ever.

[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:43.700]
Never.

[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.200]
And I remember it.

[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.860]
And I remember liking it then.

[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.120]
I was putting my makeup on.

[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:49.920]
I started dancing.

[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:50.680]
It was great.

[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:51.220]
Yeah.

[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:51.660]
Good.

[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:52.620]
Yeah.

[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:53.700]
That's how you played it.

[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.560]
What a vision.

[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:55.200]
Yeah.

[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:56.300]
Really?

[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.140]
It wasn't too bad.

[00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:57.860]
Yeah.

[00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:58.980]
Well, great.

[00:14:59.380 --> 00:14:59.540]
Yeah.

[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.460]
I haven't spoken to you all in such a long time.

[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:01.980]
Yeah.

[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.860]
It's been nothing but different voices this whole week.

[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:05.160]
Yeah.

[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:09.060]
The last time I called you to bring back from nostalgia, it was during your formula.

[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.300]
Oh, the formula.

[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.860]
Now, did you...

[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.220]
That was last Christmas.

[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:14.820]
Yeah.

[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.140]
I hadn't moved yet.

[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.780]
And I called up and you got it right.

[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:18.440]
Yeah.

[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:18.860]
Yeah.

[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.260]
Wasn't that amazing that worked so well?

[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.540]
So, if you know something, I have to tell you that I started taking the pill.

[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.480]
And now it's not right anymore.

[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:26.900]
Yeah.

[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.860]
You know, I read something someplace.

[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.620]
There's a variable that you...

[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.020]
You know, I don't know how you figure them in.

[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.380]
Now, I read somewhere that said that the reason American women's breasts are larger now

[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.800]
than they've ever been is because of birth control pills.

[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:40.760]
I did read that.

[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.320]
So, what you're saying is that's true, right?

[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.180]
Yeah, I could be.

[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.820]
But then again, there's like a downside to it, too.

[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:47.420]
Uh-oh.

[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.340]
I think there's a lot of physically fit women who do aerobics and run.

[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.880]
And I know that that tends to streamline you.

[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:53.820]
I see.

[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.580]
Touch my drift.

[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.040]
Yeah.

[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.580]
I don't know why I'm so nervous talking to you today, right?

[00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:58.140]
Oh, no, neither.

[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.120]
It's just me and I'm sure you.

[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:00.420]
That's right.

[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:00.860]
Yeah.

[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.840]
I've been a little surly today, but I'm not surly at you.

[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:04.900]
Yeah, this is true.

[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.160]
You put your foot down today.

[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:06.900]
Oh, you bet.

[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.760]
You have to do it in this business.

[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:09.380]
I bet the dirty job.

[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.600]
It's like Neil says, in this business, you have to do it.

[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.560]
Because if you know just as well as you...

[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.780]
You know that if I don't, it won't be ready.

[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.500]
Well, I have to say, I don't think it's just that business.

[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.560]
I think it's the little axioms of life.

[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:23.940]
Yeah.

[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:24.940]
You have to...

[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.420]
Yeah, there are situations in people that push you and you've got to push back because you're

[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.260]
going to get pushed down.

[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.700]
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:31.020]
Yeah.

[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.660]
And if I don't threaten, you know, they won't get it done.

[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.760]
There'll be like no reason.

[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.140]
They'll have no reason to get it done.

[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.160]
They won't care, you know?

[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.620]
But if they know, and I will stick to this, I'm going to tell you that if it's not done,

[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.920]
it's going to be all music tomorrow.

[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.200]
I don't care, you know?

[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.600]
What's okay if you bring more things out of...

[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.020]
I don't know.

[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.380]
I don't want to stay out of the closet.

[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.260]
Oh, it'll be great.

[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:50.900]
It'll be...

[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.620]
It's like can't it love.

[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.880]
It would be lots of fun.

[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.740]
Oh, it'll be great music, trust me.

[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:55.840]
I really do.

[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.500]
I have every bit of confidence in the three of you's taste in music.

[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:04.420]
And remember, we got Johnny Dark here, so it could be mind-boggling, you know?

[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.220]
Oh, my God.

[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.700]
So I remember him from when I was very young.

[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.260]
I just turned 33.

[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.140]
Oh, bless you.

[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.920]
And I am a girl from the QANF UN days.

[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.060]
Oh, my God.

[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.440]
There's little, like, radios, there's little AN radios that plugged in the wall and I had it

[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:24.360]
on my bed and I used to, like, put my ear right to it because we, you know, it was just...

[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.000]
everybody was always complaining about that kind of music back then.

[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.440]
And I remember switching back and forth between QANF and FUN.

[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:36.480]
And I very, very, very remember all of this weird stuff that you guys have been having.

[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.000]
And surf, I remember surf, but you just, like, put it all to...

[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.660]
All the way to the end.

[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.360]
Yeah, remember the station closest to your glove compartment?

[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.440]
I said that it was like the...

[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.340]
There was only AN in the beginning of the center.

[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.180]
That's correct.

[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.080]
But I remember there was something called Magic Bus then too.

[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.980]
Yeah, but that was like an underground station.

[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:55.300]
Definitely.

[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.320]
I went when I was 17, they interviewed me on the air.

[00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.100]
About what?

[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.660]
Well, my girlfriend and I used to call up.

[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.920]
We were bored and 17 and we graduated early.

[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.520]
And we named her self.

[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.340]
I was dirty Diane and she was Amara Fahmeet.

[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:08.860]
Oh, my God.

[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:14.280]
How we used to call them up really late at night and talk to them about music and life and, you know, philosophy.

[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.320]
I remember her.

[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.480]
Johnny says he remembers there.

[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.480]
I named John M.

[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.700]
That I had this massive crush on.

[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:21.440]
We went down there.

[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.900]
We got decked out in thrift shop specials and she was in gold, LaMae, and I was in black velvet.

[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:31.540]
And we had like little beauty marks that we painted on ourselves and gloves and the whole mind yards.

[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.800]
And we went down there and they interviewed us.

[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.320]
Uh-huh.

[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.400]
And we did this in the daytime and I remember when we left my house, my father, we just about had a baby.

[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.540]
Like, I was drinking out.

[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.340]
But it was real fun, yeah.

[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.020]
Now, do you know that the magic bus became gloves 94?

[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:46.600]
I do.

[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.640]
It's unfortunate things that happen.

[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.000]
I guess that's what happens when you get old.

[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:50.520]
Yeah.

[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.080]
That's when we got a run, but we're going to play an all-left-you-f-you-ing jingle for you.

[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:54.860]
Oh, thank you.

[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.620]
Have a great time.

[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.160]
Bye-bye.

[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.140]
You're with WFU-N790.

[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.720]
Where the music starts, takes four and seven.

[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.660]
That last note.

[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.120]
Amazing that she remembers, isn't it?

[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.300]
I've got a problem here.

[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:16.660]
What?

[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:17.720]
I just, um...

[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.560]
And at first I thought it was me, but I cannot find any news.

[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.260]
I've done it all.

[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.500]
And I walked over to the A.M. sign.

[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.060]
They said they're having the same problem too.

[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.980]
The only thing that you're finding is like 75% of it is Republican convention stuff.

[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.900]
And as far as the type of news we do, the bizarre, the bold, the daring type of news.

[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.180]
Okay.

[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.240]
Do you have one at all?

[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.700]
Do you have one story you can do?

[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.680]
I've got like one.

[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.860]
Okay, and I'll do...

[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:44.400]
You do one.

[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.420]
I'll look for another one.

[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.280]
Okay, I'll do one.

[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.140]
You do one, all right?

[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.020]
There's absolutely nothing happening today.

[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.540]
I get something I can do here.

[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.600]
How do you say today?

[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.460]
You say, get it started.

[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.120]
We'll be all right.

[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:53.760]
We'll be okay.

[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.400]
Just relax.

[00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:57.440]
It's on fire.

[00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.140]
It's on fire.

[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.020]
No, no, no.

[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:00.380]
Oh, no.

[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.720]
They'll be here with us for the news, Ken Day.

[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:03.160]
Oh, God.

[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.280]
It's urgent for you.

[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.740]
Ed, will you stay with us during the news?

[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.600]
I certainly will.

[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.280]
Okay.

[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.960]
Let's get going, Ken Day.

[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.640]
This is going to be a great newscast.

[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.700]
Ah, in the middle of the bed again.

[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.260]
I like that.

[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.200]
Well, in case you lost count, convention managers say about 50,000 balloons.

[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:23.780]
And I say 150,000 balloons will rain down after Bush's acceptance speech.

[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.620]
They claim it'll be a world record for an indoor balloon drop.

[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.900]
I think it will be, right?

[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.020]
Yeah.

[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.880]
I think so after, didn't you have like a birthday party once?

[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.400]
It was like 25,000.

[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:32.660]
Uh-huh.

[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.120]
Cedar Point theme amusement park in San Descoye, Ohio is building what is built as the largest,

[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.600]
fastest roller coaster in the world.

[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.640]
That's a good story.

[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.180]
Called the Magnum XL200.

[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.060]
It'll go 70 plus miles per hour.

[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:46.360]
Whoa.

[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.100]
It will peak at 210 feet.

[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:54.760]
Now after that, it's 156 foot hill and 80 foot hill, two tunnels and smaller hills.

[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:59.200]
Take you two and a half minutes and it should be ready for the 1989 season.

[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.200]
No, see, I guess I missed that one.

[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.040]
That's a good story.

[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.400]
That would be a great story, man.

[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.140]
That's a good one.

[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.020]
And for the third time, I'll announce the birthdays today.

[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.160]
Shelley Winner's a 66.

[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.060]
Rosalind Carter, 61.

[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.540]
Movie director Roman Polanski, 55, who's still not allowed in this country.

[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:16.600]
That's right.

[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:17.080]
I know.

[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.940]
Robert Redford is 51.

[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.480]
Martin Moll's 45.

[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.200]
Actor Dancer Patrick Swayze, 34.

[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.480]
And Malcolm.

[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:27.880]
Do I have to?

[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:28.200]
Yes.

[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.040]
Malcolm's Jamal Warner, 18.

[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:36.100]
And I've been, a dare has been laid down.

[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.100]
The gauntlet has been thrown down before me.

[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.500]
I'm going to watch the concert for the first time tonight.

[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.560]
Isn't this great, Ed?

[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.720]
And the first time you've ever been with is during the newscast.

[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.180]
And of your company.

[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.600]
He's out of the house.

[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:50.760]
He's 99 blue.

[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.880]
Major drugs are passed today.

[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.440]
You're lonely tonight.

[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.560]
You're losing all my...

[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.320]
It's going in.

[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.720]
Ed, would you like to go on that rollercoaster?

[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.640]
What kind of rollercoaster is going on about 129 times?

[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.580]
I think that guy, that's really a poor bitch,

[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.600]
that you're going to build it grateful.

[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.080]
I think you want to bury him in it.

[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:14.640]
You know what?

[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.000]
See how it all finsed together Captain Dave?

[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.800]
Finally, I mean, Ed, you put me, you've cheered me up.

[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.340]
I think he's busy eating six hot balls.

[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.880]
I guess he can't go on a roll into it.

[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:30.700]
I'll never doubt Neil's opinion about panic phone calls.

[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.300]
I'm still searching, you know.

[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.100]
Here comes the nervous panel.

[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.640]
He'll be back, Monday.

[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.800]
Ed, here comes the weather now.

[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:39.740]
I think about much.

[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:40.320]
Here we go.

[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:40.600]
That's right.

[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.120]
30% chance of afternoon thunderstorms.

[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:43.840]
Hi, today 92.

[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.120]
20% tonight, looking pretty good.

[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.660]
But then we do have a 50-50 chance against starting tomorrow.

[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.700]
Right now it's 81, my friend.

[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.680]
Let's 9-53.

[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.640]
You want to know.

[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.840]
They have options on the radio.

[00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:04.000]
He brings you all sorts of topics to listen to on your show.

[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.840]
Monday through Friday.

[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.840]
Before 6 to 9 to 10.

[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.800]
And he's talking to you.

[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:12.620]
Right here.

[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:13.520]
Right here.

[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.140]
I'll say that 4.

[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.020]
Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers in the mornings.

[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.020]
Sanis Classic Rock every day.

[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.800]
Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers in the mornings.

[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.880]
Sanis Classic Rock every day.

[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.580]
Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers in the mornings.

[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.700]
Sanis Classic Rock every day.

[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.960]
Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers, Neil Rogers in the mornings.

[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.580]
Sanis Classic Rock every day.

[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:43.960]
You have a problem with that.

[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.520]
It's so full of misinformation.

[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.900]
And they're going to go to 10-30 actually.

[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.580]
Yeah, before 6 till after 10.

[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.840]
Maybe 10 o'clock and 30 seconds maybe.

[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.520]
9-57 means we have this.

[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.660]
This has been the longest show we have been since we've...

[00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.140]
I agree.

[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.100]
This has been a battle royal mango sleepy.

[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.600]
I feel like a wrestler.

[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.760]
You know, I feel like...

[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.200]
The colors have been great.

[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:05.980]
They've made up four.

[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.820]
The colors have been fine.

[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:07.680]
Ed was wonderful.

[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.280]
They aren't doing the news with Ed.

[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.320]
Was a historic.

[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.700]
Didn't make any sense at all.

[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.540]
But that's natural.

[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.500]
Now, tomorrow is our last show.

[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.220]
Neil will be back Monday.

[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.480]
And Peter Boulder is in the building.

[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.920]
And I say again, if we are not in our old regular Neil Rogers studio tomorrow...

[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.540]
No, don't get so full.

[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.900]
It is going to be music intensive.

[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:29.740]
Music intensive.

[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:30.740]
I'm...

[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.340]
They shouldn't have put this through this anyway.

[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:33.400]
And we've overcome.

[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.680]
We've made it sound good.

[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.180]
You know, when Greg goes on vacation,

[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.120]
noodles plays music all week.

[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.400]
He's a disc jockey.

[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.820]
Sell-down backwards.

[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.860]
And does this mean that I have to raid the closet and bring in just staccents?

[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.680]
Do you better be prepared?

[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:47.920]
I want you prepared.

[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.280]
I want you to do that anyway.

[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.300]
Now that you have a contingency plan.

[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:50.880]
Maybe we should do it.

[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.540]
Maybe we'll do it anyway, because it's Friday.

[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.240]
Maybe we...

[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.380]
You know, if we are in the studio, maybe we'll do some of that.

[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:56.160]
And we play to music.

[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.600]
This morning we'll play all music tomorrow.

[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.900]
Now, if we're back in the regular studio, we'll do a regular show.

[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.040]
Maybe we can be...

[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:01.040]

[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.760]
Maybe one song and one bit, one song and one bit.

[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:03.600]
Maybe something like that.

[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.620]
What am I playing for?

[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:05.560]
I'm ready to get out of here.

[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.620]
First record is make me smile by Chicago.

[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:08.460]
Oh, I do.

[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.460]
Let's hit ramp to zero and we get out of the...

[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.340]
You're not going to take these three?

[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:11.960]
No, I'm sorry.

[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:12.520]
Oh, come on.

[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:12.900]
No.

[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.460]
They've been holding on forever.

[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:15.360]
Okay.

[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:15.900]
I mean, just...

[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.440]
I'm from a...

[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:17.680]
Hi.

[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:19.460]
Hello, Johnny.

[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.080]
Hello, everybody.

[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:20.940]
This is Glenn.

[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:21.900]
I mean, Glenn, how you doing?

[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.260]
You're our last callers.

[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:23.700]
Yes, Glenn.

[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.580]
I have a couple of good obscure oldies that Johnny Jark...

[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.520]
I mean, the names of obscure oldies.

[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.900]
Chick-a-chick-a-boom-boom by Willie in the Red River Band.

[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:33.560]
Wow.

[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.100]
In 1969, it heard that.

[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.140]
I haven't heard that in a long time.

[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:36.640]
Uh-huh.

[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.020]
And also, Albert Cabana.

[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.620]
Albert Cabani by Shannon.

[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.360]
That's...

[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:41.880]
And how...

[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.440]
What do you think of that?

[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.260]
I wonder why the guys made me take this call.

[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:46.160]
Oh, ho, ho.

[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.060]
The guys.

[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:48.640]
The guys.

[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.360]
Chick-a-boom with Daddy Doodra.

[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.560]
Yeah, where'd he get the name...

[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.040]
Where'd you get the name for Chick-a-boom?

[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:53.760]
That was Daddy Doodra.

[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.320]
I'm gonna take a little Chick-a-chick-a-boom-boom by Willie in the Red River Band.

[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.000]
No, it's by Daddy Doodra.

[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.560]
This is another one in 1969.

[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:00.400]
No.

[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.940]
Well, that was like Daddy Doodra was 70 or 70.

[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.580]
I know, 70.

[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.260]
I'm going to drop to zero.

[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.680]
And we get out to late.

[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.120]
I'm sorry.

[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:06.980]
Maybe he's right.

[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:07.620]
Maybe you're right.

[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.400]
Let me ask one more thing.

[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.720]
Whatever happens to lead your lead.

[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:12.260]
Um...

[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.560]
He's soft for another season.

[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.120]
He's in Iowa.

[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.340]
He went back home.

[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.620]
He's planting corn in Iowa.

[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:17.240]
Yeah.

[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.340]
Your station in Iowa?

[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.260]
No, I do not.

[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.080]
Yeah, thank you, mate.

[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:20.920]
Okay. All right.

[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:21.700]
Now, can I hit Rampus?

[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:22.160]
No, no, no.

[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:22.780]
You got two more.

[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:23.800]
Two more.

[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:23.920]
Two more.

[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.360]
Okay, I won.

[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.720]
We got to end it with a good phone.

[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.020]
Hello.

[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:26.840]
Grant.

[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:27.240]
Yeah.

[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:27.800]
How you doing?

[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:29.080]
This is Manny from Kendall, man.

[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:29.760]
Hey, Manny.

[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.600]
Hey, I called because that guy you told me to go work for a lot

[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.080]
and how you could really kiss me off.

[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:35.660]
Me too.

[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.060]
No, no.

[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.540]
Drop the nuclear one on him.

[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:38.960]
Oh.

[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:39.740]
Great idea.

[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.180]
I'm not better now.

[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.020]
Yeah, me too.

[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.260]
Hey, I want to tell you, even that you guys have overcome,

[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.820]
you guys have done an unbelievable job this week.

[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:51.980]
Thank you very much.

[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.180]
I'm having a lot of rules over it.

[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.040]
I've been doing great on the phones with the equipment that he has.

[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:56.500]
I know.

[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.600]
At that station.

[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.940]
We overcome, man.

[00:26:59.100 --> 00:26:59.440]
We overcome.

[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.440]
They have no idea.

[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.720]
You're working on it, though.

[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.780]
These guys are working their butts off of it, right?

[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:03.960]

[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.040]
Under normal conditions, we overcome, sir.

[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.860]
Yeah, I just wanted to compliment you guys you've been doing great.

[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.260]
And, you know, it's also going to be great to hear Neil get on Monday.

[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:12.880]
Absolutely.

[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:13.700]
Thanks a lot.

[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:14.120]
All right.

[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:14.620]
Take care.

[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:15.020]
Bye-bye.

[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.380]
WZTA, Miami Beach Center, do it.

[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.760]
One more.

[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.040]
Yeah.

[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:22.640]
Is this Glenn?

[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:23.120]
Yeah.

[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:23.780]
Hey, Glenn.

[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:24.220]
Hey.

[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:24.840]
How's it going?

[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:25.560]
This is AJ.

[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:26.140]
Hey.

[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:27.520]
What's up?

[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:28.880]
I'm, uh, AJ.

[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.940]
Yeah, I heard that you read my card over the radio.

[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.380]
Sorry if I made him say.

[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.180]
No, we got a big laugh out of it, AJ.

[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.100]
Yeah, I got it right here.

[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.540]
I was just looking at it right before you took it.

[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.940]
I was driving on the Palm Edo and I heard that.

[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:42.280]
Yeah.

[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.420]
Donned on me that, you know, the bird and Glenn.

[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.280]
Yeah, it gave us a laugh, AJ.

[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:47.880]
That's right.

[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.060]
That's one of the few we've had.

[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:49.400]
Yeah.

[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:50.720]
I'm going to have a radio.

[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:51.640]
It was a perfect, yeah.

[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.920]
I was, remember I called you.

[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.060]
It was, it's funny how things work out, AJ.

[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.900]
It was the perfect day I needed a laugh today.

[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:57.260]
Oh, yeah.

[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.840]
Well, I, I, I called, I believe, two days ago.

[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.180]
Remember, and I, uh, parked you off the air.

[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:02.680]
Absolutely.

[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:03.380]

[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.600]
I mean, you hung up on me.

[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.340]
Well, don't take it personally.

[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:06.800]
Yeah.

[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.200]
That's, that's, that's what you told me then.

[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.280]
Yeah, it's been a rough week.

[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.460]
Uh, Rich does this and he's not going to be in this week, though.

[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.280]
Have him mail it out to you next week, okay?

[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.020]
That would be great.

[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:15.700]
Okay, man.

[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.180]
That would be great.

[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.400]
I'll, I'll put you guys up right next to my radio.

[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.740]
That way I won't forget every morning.

[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.100]
Great.

[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.280]
Great to hear from you, AJ.

[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:21.660]
All right.

[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.260]
See you later.

[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:22.600]
All right.

[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.820]
Now can we play make me smile by Chicago now?

[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.440]
Can we play it?

[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.100]
Get your ramp.

[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:28.660]
Shit.

[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.240]
Get your ramp.

[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.080]
I don't believe it.

[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.400]
Aren't you relieved that now it's over?

[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.820]
Do I take any more hundreds of calls before we go?

[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.460]
Only if you want to do after ten.

[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:37.060]

[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.180]
This is WZTA.

[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.440]
Now do we have to wait for this to run down?

[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:41.580]
Oh, that's where we can hit the record.

[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.300]
Yeah, we can hit it now.

[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:42.740]
Okay.

[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.160]
Why isn't it, uh, this has been, uh,

[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.340]
I've never been through a radio show like it.

[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.380]
Nothing worked.

[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.620]
No way, right now.

[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.640]
It's a whole place.

[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.180]
Not one thing has worked this day.

[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.040]
No, it's not cycling.

[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.420]
Oh my god.

[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.260]
That's what I think I'm going to do when I get home.

[00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:57.900]
A little cycling.

[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.300]
I'm going to go suck my head personally.

[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.160]
Nine, eight, seven, six.

[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.100]
What is this?

[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:04.700]
New years?

[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.680]
We got to do something else while, uh.

[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.380]
Okay, we're out of delay kids.

[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:09.940]
Okay.

[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.260]
So now we wait long enough boys and girls.

[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.880]
We may hear a record come on.

[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.280]
But I wouldn't go to the bank on it.

[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.380]
Well, we can't play make me smoke because it won't play.

[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:22.200]
How about the next one?

[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.240]
What would just put in a different place?

[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.040]
Yeah, please.

[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.180]
You're never going to get off the air today.

[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:27.680]
See you guys tomorrow.

[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:28.680]
I'm leaving.

[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.180]
You guys can stay here with Captain Dave and Johnny Dark and Gonzer and everything.

[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.200]
But I'm going home.

[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.460]
It's been a long time.

[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:34.980]
Just wonderful.

[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.900]
It's 10-03.

[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.700]
It's 10-03 now.

[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.320]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:42.760]
That one's not working either.

[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:43.860]
See you tomorrow, kid.

[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.540]
Yeah, I'll come under that one.

[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.220]
Whatever you think.

[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:47.980]
Okay.

[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.060]
Okay, see y'all later.
