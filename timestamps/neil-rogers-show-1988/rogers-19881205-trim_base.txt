[00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.960]
Newstalk Radio 610 W-I-O-D presents Neil Rogers.

[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.140]
To get a touch and talk, call 751 W-I-O-D in Dade.

[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.560]
524 W-I-O-D in Broward.

[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.480]
Or 655 and 278 W-I-O-D in the Palm Beaches.

[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.980]
Other areas may call Calet.

[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.900]
The opinions expressed by the host guests or callers

[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.000]
are not necessarily those of the station.

[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.020]
Now, here's Neil Rogers on Newstalk Radio 610 W-I-O-D.

[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.300]
Now, the audience of the day with Neil Rogers.

[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.900]
Neil Rogers.

[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.020]
Neil Rogers.

[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.720]
The number one winner, W-I-O-D,

[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.880]
Xavier AM.

[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.540]
What are you studying?

[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.940]
What's kind of jazz, Ian?

[00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.120]
Yeah, 1006 W-I-O-D probably goes on forever,

[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.200]
but you know Mike.

[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.160]
Got a whole bunch of cards here that Mike left us.

[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.720]
You know, one thing about that stuff.

[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.780]
They're either great or exactly.

[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.860]
Now, don't stick your finger away down there, Roger.

[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.460]
Mike, it caught.

[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.120]
Anyway, here we are.

[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.080]
We hope you had a great weekend.

[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.180]
I was out of town, so I have no idea what went on

[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.080]
in this God-for-sake-in-town over the weekend.

[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.500]
Not good.

[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.180]
And, maybe somebody will call.

[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.600]
I'm curious how that big race at Pomfano with Maclowe Bell

[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.300]
came on Saturday.

[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.780]
I know nobody else cares, but somebody will call.

[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.320]
And I'll find out.

[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.480]
Because I wasn't here.

[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.520]
Nothing went on.

[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.340]
Nothing went on?

[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.680]
No.

[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.360]
And the big thing, of course, I was afraid the miss

[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.480]
was the Ernie Soach-and-Show on Saturday.

[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.700]
Oh, I missed it.

[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.620]
Did you miss it, too?

[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.920]
Yeah.

[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.440]
Well, that could be one of our big topics today.

[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.600]
Now, I have a major announcement to make on this

[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.260]
here radio show, and just a couple of minutes,

[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.120]
a gigantic, cataclysmic announcement.

[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.780]
Wow.

[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.840]
But before we do that, almost as cataclysmic is this

[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.620]
announcement, WPBR in Palm Beach, and we want to give this

[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.780]
guy all the help we can.

[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.500]
Oh, no.

[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.540]
Because God only knows he needs it, OK?

[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.900]
Paul Lyle.

[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.080]
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.800]
The same one who's sat, not in this chair, because this

[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.260]
studio wasn't here then, but was in his building,

[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.680]
bragging about the fact he was going to get me off the

[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.880]
ear.

[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.500]
If it was the last thing he did.

[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.760]
He's doing mornings now, 6 to 9 a.m. at WPBR in West Palm

[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.020]
Beach.

[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.040]
Now, that's a station very much like FTL, or if you're

[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.980]
going to listen to it, you've got to drive up there and sit

[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.940]
right under the tower.

[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.180]
So you better leave about 430, maybe a quarter to five in

[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.900]
the morning, and a good luck to you.

[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.840]
Now, are you saying this is the Bob Gordon of Palm Beach?

[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.600]
That is correct.

[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.080]
Wow.

[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.940]
That's in line, isn't it?

[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.220]
Isn't it amazing?

[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.080]
FTL.

[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.820]
Now, that's a station that is a monster signal when you're on the

[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.660]
turnpike, it even interferes with us for about a quarter of a

[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.020]
mile.

[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.880]
Anywhere else you can't hear it.

[00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.740]
And the people who work there, they all fit into a certain

[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.100]
mold.

[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.080]
There are guys who have, don't belong into business.

[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.220]
There are guys who were washed up 20 years ago who wind up

[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.180]
there as kind of like a last gas.

[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.920]
It's a bizarre place.

[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.560]
Also, another nearly cataclysmic announcement on the Steve

[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.400]
King show today.

[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.260]
Uh-oh.

[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.080]
And you're not going to believe this, OK?

[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.740]
Happy Hanukkah, by the way.

[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.940]
Let me hold on to something.

[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.380]
And in honor of Hanukkah, we have another Rabbi show.

[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.080]
And Sharon was in here banging her head on the wall having an

[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.740]
nervous breakdown.

[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.620]
A debate on who is a Jew legislation, Israel barring not Orthodox

[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.320]
converts from Israeli citizenship with Rabbi Pinkis Phineas

[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.940]
Webberman.

[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.140]
Another one of my good friends.

[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.640]
Pinky?

[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.600]
Pinky Webberman.

[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.940]
Uh-huh.

[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.900]
And Rabbi Loring Frank.

[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.400]
Loring.

[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.960]
Loring.

[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.240]
Or is that Frank Loring?

[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.200]
Now, Frank is a very good-ish name.

[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.380]
And Loring is a very, so maybe it's not even a Jewish

[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.740]
Rabbi.

[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.020]
Maybe it's a good-ish Rabbi.

[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.220]
Steve is so obsessed with these thinking rabbis, man.

[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.020]
In fact, everybody who thinks that Steve, let's see these

[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.320]
phones go crazy, OK?

[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.640]
O'Macklo Bell 1 and paid $2.10.

[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.880]
Thank you, folks, so much.

[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.380]
Anyway, everybody in the audience who thinks Steve's had too many

[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.260]
rabbis, let's get these lines going, OK?

[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.120]
And by the way, we want to thank Mitch Must be responsible for this.

[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.340]
The numbers are now here.

[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.500]
No, you did it.

[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.060]
The numbers.

[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.900]
Mitch did that.

[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.680]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.060]
We want to thank him profusely.

[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.380]
Not only do we have the clock, ladies and gentlemen, we now have

[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.640]
the telephone numbers emblazoned permanently on our little thing

[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.020]
here.

[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.860]
What a day.

[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.300]
And boy, when you got number phone numbers emblazoned on your little

[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.220]
thing, that's a really desperation, OK?

[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.720]
And also we have a cassette boy.

[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.680]
We are so full of it for the beginning of the week.

[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.020]
Yeah.

[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.740]
I don't see the lines flashing about the Rabbi, by the way.

[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.480]
Well, there you go.

[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.060]
What does that tell you?

[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.020]
It tells me that what's going to be another one of those Mondays, OK?

[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.240]
Now, last week we had, the week was great except for Monday.

[00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.940]
And it was a Monday after a dolphin loss.

[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.420]
What have we always said about that?

[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.620]
Of course, the only problem is we're getting used to that.

[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.360]
Every Monday now is the Monday after a dolphin loss.

[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.640]
That won't happen next week.

[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.400]
You know why?

[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.720]
Because they're playing Monday night.

[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.340]
Oh, then it will be Tuesday.

[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.200]
So nice Monday is going to be great Tuesday.

[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.980]
It's going to be like you're in Kipper, OK?

[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.140]
I'll prepare for that.

[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.380]
Now, I have something for you that you don't know about.

[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.860]
Really?

[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.120]
Something that's going to make you real happy.
