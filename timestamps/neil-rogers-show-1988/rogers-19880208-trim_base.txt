[00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.320]
Fascist pigs put that card together because I spend his very own hard earned money to buy that thing.

[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.340]
Okay, what a very appropriate timing, too, wasn't it?

[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:09.520]
Huh?

[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.940]
Right after we heard that little thing there, speaking of little things, let's talk about Joey for a moment.

[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.020]
Now we have some very amazing scuttle butt from Dennis Folger.

[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.760]
Scuttle butt?

[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.200]
Yes.

[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.340]
Captain Dave will be very pleased to learn that the management over at Chi,

[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.120]
or have they changed the pronoun?

[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:33.020]
It's just that it's still Chi, Shim, or Chi, like Iranian.

[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.180]
That's what I said.

[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.360]
You know, just when I brought his mic off, I tried to give him a little pocket news,

[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.580]
and it's like he's trying to blow up in there, self-destruct.

[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.000]
Can you just shut up?

[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.040]
Yeah, that's it.

[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.480]
Excellent.

[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.300]
Can't say that.

[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.420]
Anyway, he put together that little ID that we played yesterday with some blast from the past,

[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.100]
from back in December, whenever it was.

[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.220]
Well, the management at Chi, him, or whatever that is.

[00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.040]
Come on, I mean.

[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.260]
He hadn't heard that call the day when Joey called in, and wished me all the success.

[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.000]
We did our little thing, and he said, I hope you beat me in a rating, because you're better than I am.

[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.740]
They heard it yesterday.

[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.360]
And we're not pleased.

[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.880]
Really?

[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.760]
You're kidding.

[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.420]
They were pleased?

[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.400]
They were not pleased.

[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.980]
I'm Neil.

[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.360]
Yeah.

[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.380]
I hope you beat me in the ratings, you're better than I am.

[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.520]
Even the competition agrees, the Neil Rogers show on WZGK, Miami Beach,

[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.680]
Fort Lauderdale, and the Palm beaches, is the best morning show in South Florida.

[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.420]
I don't think I don't get to nice here on an AM station as a hero in my book.

[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.700]
You're like, they're Thomas Aquatic.

[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.800]
You got no problem with me.

[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.400]
Even the other morning shows listen to the Neil Rogers show on They The Four.

[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.460]
I hope you beat me in the ratings, you're better than I am.

[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.060]
Yeah, Joey.

[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.660]
You don't like that?

[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.360]
They didn't like that.

[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.160]
In fact, the word is that Joey was rather subdued sounding on the year this morning because evidently,

[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.060]
well, they give them a rough time.

[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.620]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.120]
Yeah.

[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.640]
In fact, we have a little actuality that we, the Winner, we let the Winns people borrow pollution by Tom Lear.

[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.180]
Right.

[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.060]
Mike Wolf brought something by for us.

[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.540]
A little inside actuality from the staff meeting they had, late yesterday afternoon at 6.

[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.920]
You can stay there again.

[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.020]
You can stay there again.

[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.480]
When I'm done.

[00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:14.520]
When I'm done.

[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.360]
A27 on Zeta 4.

[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.520]
That's like, we have to hear the fit my favorite part of the jingle.

[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.900]
Yeah.

[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.060]
I wore it at the end.

[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.840]
For the first time, those words swing and burn.

[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.460]
It's just what they did yesterday.

[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.820]
Oh boy.

[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.300]
So what?

[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.000]
Yeah.

[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.120]
Neil Riley.

[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.060]
He's a new one.

[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.600]
In stereo.

[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.320]
Yeah.

[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.940]
Rocker's roll.

[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.860]
Billy Boyle Reynolds.

[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.440]
Never give up.

[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.180]
He's still much more than we go in on string to 94.9.

[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.980]
Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil.

[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.580]
Neil, Neil, Ryder, Saul, and Joe.

[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.380]
Yeah.

[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.520]

[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.780]
You talk about how sometimes songs just fit right into the show.

[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.560]
This is so perfect for creation.

[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:51.040]
As you are, as you are, what you need.

[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.520]
Is the fun to hear all over the world?

[00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.780]
Is the story with his one old friend, Emily Boyle?

[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.540]
I'm now on.

[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.000]
You will find, Emily Boyle switching over to Zeta 4.

[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.400]
Yeah.

[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.700]
Neil, Ryder, Neil.

[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.360]
Neil, Neil, Ryder, Saul, and Joe.

[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.680]
Yeah.

[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.600]
Ryder, Saul, and Joe.

[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.880]
Neil, Neil, Ryder, Neil, Neil, Ryder.

[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.900]
Yeah.

[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.360]
Put that Stinking Pan's Jingle company right out of business.

[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.520]
Unbelievable.

[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.800]
Okay, that is excellent.

[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.600]
717 on Zeta 4.

[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.440]
Now, let me see again who that was.

[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.460]
This is the four listeners.

[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.100]
Remember them?

[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.360]
This is the new Neil Rogers show in stereo.

[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.680]
Oh, there's another cut on here.

[00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.780]
Oh, see.

[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:00.700]
Can we handle that?

[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.880]

[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.900]
I have the four listeners.

[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.520]
It's got something new with their favorite again.

[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.900]
Joey.

[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.240]
Hey, Joe.

[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.880]
What you doing?

[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.800]
Home over here again.

[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.260]
Yeah, that's no show, you're out of.

[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.300]
You're out of your mouth, you're bummed low.

[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.740]
Neil, I'm here.

[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.120]
I want you to go back to bummed low.

[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.820]
With a yellow snow and good ladies alone.

[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.380]
You're out of your brain, though.

[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.460]
I'm here.

[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.640]
I'm here.

[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.820]
I'm here.

[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.360]
I'm here.

[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.500]
Hey, Joe.

[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.820]
Let me get you back to normal.

[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.440]
I'm ready, you'll look good.

[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.520]
Listen, that worked by Eddie Van Halen, is that good or what?

[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.580]
Either him or clap then one of the other.

[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.920]
Hello, and the pro series.

[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.280]
One more time.

[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.120]
That's that.

[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.220]
That's for you, Joey.

[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.700]
That was sensational.

[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.580]
Wait till you hear this call we're going to make.

[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.940]
You are just going to freak out.

[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.720]
Sorry for what?

[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:35.920]
Look at this movie that opens.

[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.900]
Death Row games show.

[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:45.700]
They said, chop toden, the host wants you to die laughing.

[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.900]
Okay, now you think they're going to get upset when we tell them that they're on the air?

[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.900]
Oh, well, they're going to get...

[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:51.720]
You don't know who I'm calling.

[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:52.620]
Oh, do you?

[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.600]
You're not really.

[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.380]
Yes, I am.

[00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.540]
Let me buckle my seatbelt.

[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.520]
This ought to be a great call if they ever pick it up.

[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.800]
Is this the hotline or the loopline?

[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.380]
I didn't say it.

[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.360]
I think he said hot.

[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.100]
Hot.

[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:08.760]
Hot.

[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.220]
How hot?

[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.540]
How hot is it?

[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.760]
It's so hot that they can't even touch the phone.

[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.380]
Are you going to... they won't pick it up.

[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:15.700]
Hello.

[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:16.600]
Hello.

[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.000]
Who is this?

[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.840]
This is Neil Rogers, Bill.

[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.140]
No kidding.

[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.660]
You're on the air on Z4.

[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:24.140]
Yeah.

[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.440]
You're on the air right now, Bill, so watch yourself.

[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.040]
What happened?

[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:29.720]
Did he hang up?

[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.380]
Yes, he did.

[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.020]
He hung up.

[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.700]
Oh, he didn't hang up?

[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.980]
Oh, that was call waiting.

[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.720]
How can you have...

[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.820]
How can you have call waiting?

[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.680]
What are you doing, Joey?

[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.640]
There's another show calling.

[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.400]
Hang on a second.

[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.820]
Oh, okay. It's probably Greg.

[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.560]
Call waiting.

[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.520]
What are these guys doing?

[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.840]
Probably... it's probably taping this now.

[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.360]
Somebody probably knew you were calling.

[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.220]
No, they didn't.

[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.860]
Why, do you think they're monitoring us?

[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:55.800]
What did you do?

[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.460]
Put us on hold?

[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.060]
Bill.

[00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.760]
I mean, this is a big time radio show.

[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.040]
We don't have time to even put on hold.

[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.120]
They're not on hold.

[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.060]
Are we on the air?

[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.440]
We want to keep phone systems.

[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.380]
Okay. Do you really?

[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.120]
Who is this?

[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:06.480]
Joey.

[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:07.940]
What are you doing?

[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.940]
How are you doing, Joey?

[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.340]
What's going on?

[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.320]
You just got off of the...

[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:11.940]
Oh, be a...

[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:12.500]
Gosh darn.

[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.280]
Did you see the stuff?

[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.640]
You're putting me on the air and that thing, are you?

[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.900]
You're on the air right now, Joey.

[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:16.780]
Oh, that's all right.

[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.400]
Come on, you know.

[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.080]
Why are you making us talk to the enemies when we're so much alive?

[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.040]
We could have been cloned.

[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:21.720]
I know it.

[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.220]
Well, listen.

[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.160]
You're not my type, Joey.

[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:23.640]
Come on.

[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.080]
Did you see the articles?

[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:26.600]
For not with you.

[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.220]
Joey, would you listen to me for a second, please?

[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.460]
Wait, let me ask you one question.

[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.460]
I'd like to see an answer.

[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.500]
I love it, Joey.

[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.760]
I love being close to you.

[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.760]
Should I make you take that at post-song off?

[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.660]
Yes, they did.

[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:37.000]
Why?

[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.860]
Well, because the corporate people are assholes and they, you know, we're taking it personally.

[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.620]
It's because my artillery yesterday.

[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.340]
Did they really?

[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.520]
Yes, they put it in the study.

[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.960]
They won't let it play the damn thing anymore.

[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.340]
Wait a minute.

[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.720]
Ladies and gentlemen, here's a major bullet in Joey Lostas' asshole yesterday on G.

[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:51.620]
I can't.

[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.780]
I'm telling you, they're still with me.

[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.160]
Yes, and the managers in the meeting are still with me.

[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.140]
They're going to cut us into new ones.

[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:56.900]
Yeah.

[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:04.300]
Well, I'll tell you, those radio management people, they're all cut out of the same mold, aren't they?

[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.520]
Yeah, me and I love you.

[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.480]
There's only one person in China who feels terrible about your mood.

[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.380]
And who's that, Joey?

[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.040]
That major.

[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:10.780]
He lost his act.

[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:11.500]
I know.

[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.640]
What is he going to get in act?

[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.700]
What's his story, anyway?

[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.860]
He lost his shadow.

[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.560]
I mean, everything you do, he doesn't know what it was.

[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.580]
What is he, Chinese food?

[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.340]
Yesterday, he got a great idea.

[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.700]
Said he's going to start opening his mail out of the air now.

[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.880]
I wonder where he got that idea.

[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:23.740]
Tell a minute, please.

[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.980]
The velocity photos they are using, they're intellectuals.

[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.140]
I think they're going to attract us.

[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.420]
By the way, Joey, we've got to call from Stan Roberts on the other line now.

[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.660]
Stan Roberts, pass!

[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.540]
He says all my old buddies.

[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.220]
I know, I'm going to throw names at you, boy.

[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.280]
And Tom Shannon's waiting, too, as a matter of fact.

[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.440]
Let's plug that guy who wrote the article about us in the South Florida magazine.

[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.840]
That's what I was trying to say when you kept interrupting me, Joey.

[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.940]
His name is Logan, maybe?

[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:47.880]
Maybe.

[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:48.420]
Maybe.

[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.840]
How much food do I have in you?

[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:50.820]
Yeah, you really are.

[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.640]
You're a pretty good person.

[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.500]
I've kept it pretty good, haven't I?

[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.420]
As a matter of fact, I want to tell you something, Joey.

[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.620]
I got your, you know, on your mortgage application.

[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.060]
Yeah, thanks for waiting in on the air.

[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:00.480]
You're so good.

[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.920]
I didn't give the address, though.

[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:02.860]
I couldn't have done a lot worse.

[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.820]
But anyway, I've got your address, and I'm going to tell you, I'm going to come over and hang out a while, you know?

[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.540]
Come on over, I love you, the Joey.

[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.420]
Joey has a new assistant.

[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.060]
20th over here to hang out, Neil.

[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.940]
I think I was just a nice year on an AM station as a hero in my book.

[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.240]
You're like, say Thomas Aquatic, you've got no problem with me.

[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:17.660]
Exactly.

[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.180]
I always knew you were a good guy, Joey.

[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.400]
I love you, I'll see you soon.

[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:20.980]
Bye-bye.

[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:21.680]
Bye-bye.

[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.420]
Bye-bye.

[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.520]
There it goes.

[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.420]
Oh, that was a good call.

[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.240]
He was real nice.

[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.180]
That was an excellent call.

[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.540]
That was an award-winning call.

[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.520]
Joey, you're okay.

[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.880]
We're not going to plug those other fakers from now on.

[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.020]
I'm going to enjoy it with so friendly.
