[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540]
I'm at a experience this yesterday was like two hours today

[00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.580]
I feel like it should be 10 o'clock already really well on that cable. Let's just pretend it is you move that clock ahead

[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.220]
All right, so I move this one ahead. I'll move my watch ahead, which is no big deal

[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.420]
That Arlene man, I'm telling you know, what do they got a big number on an a.m. And she just a cackling up a storm

[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.700]
I wonder who she stole that from

[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.080]
What is this? I always knew Arlene could lay a gigantic egg on an a.m.

[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.320]
And the wait till the next book comes out. Oh

[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.340]
That's young Neil that's that's Neil Jr. I'd recognize that anywhere

[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.240]
Oh, that's the egg junior

[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.980]
Are we gonna do the idea are you just gonna screw around in there? I'm gonna I'll tell you what if you don't play the idea

[00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.160]
I'm gonna play a record. Now what the hell are you gonna do? Oh?

[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:57.140]
This is WZTA Miami Beach ford Lauderdale and the Palm beaches the Neil Rogers show. It's eight o'clock

[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.680]
Now that is the egg junior isn't it?

[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.440]
Yeah, it is. Oh, I have a story. I didn't

[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.320]
The story I didn't get to we were so busy. I wonder if I could mention it to you go right ahead

[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.020]
I see you were really moved by that

[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.060]
Really got into that in a big way by the way just before you do that

[00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.020]
I'm supposed to mention that on Gonjus Grill Day

[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.180]
There's gonna be a thrill on the grill

[00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.600]
That's because Jeff

[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.700]
Jeff Jeff or whatever the hell is name is gonna sit on the grill but anyway he's got what a trifecta man

[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.780]
George Thuragu. That's right today's the day

[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.160]
Elvis Presley and Rod Stewart. That's not Elvis Jr. This is Elvis Sino

[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.240]
As in dead yeah

[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.400]
Yeah, he's in very dead yeah

[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.340]
As in fat

[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.780]
drugged out

[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.680]
Dead

[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.120]
But he's the king but he's still a king. Yeah, well look at me. Okay, go ahead

[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.440]
Now what was your story we're gonna do? Well, they did a 25 state

[00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.560]
study

[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.520]
That showed the proportion of overweight residents in each state

[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.260]
And the lowest into the state where they're the skinniest is Utah

[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.320]
I wonder what 14% are overweight. Oh, but that's because they counted all the Osmond brothers

[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.600]
Oh, yeah, and the state where they're don't they look anorexic. Yeah

[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.580]
Donnie looks a little anorexic too. Mm-hmm. He always has Utah and the state and Hawaii also came out 14%

[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.780]
By the way, there are no fat Osmond. Oh, there is one fat Osmond brother isn't it Jimmy?

[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.900]
Jimmy Osmond he's a little fat. Oh, yeah, looks like Tom Likus. He looks like a little Tom Likus

[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.680]
Well, the state with the most overweight. Well, he looks like a little house Tom looks like a duplex right was

[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.480]
West Virginia had the most fat people 24%

[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.460]
And that's weird because they have the most unemployed. How where do they find food in the coal mines?

[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.700]
A lot of poor people in West Virginia. There must be a lot of calories in coal, huh?

[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.400]
Well poor people they say tend to have more weight problems

[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.040]
And that is a studies from the Center for Disease Control. Well, I wonder if that's Oferous problem

[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.220]
So they made 27 million last year. That is she's been dropping the weight. Yeah, she's been hanging around an opal ockie

[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.300]
It's a 803 on Zeta 4 that was certainly just mind-bomb

[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.860]
We just ran out of time. We couldn't do that in the room. We were to be sure to get that in

[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.180]
Okay, you're acutely a surey Valencia is listening. Whatever you do don't move to West Virginia

[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.260]
She's like just chronic tired. She just obsessed. She lost a lot of weight

[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.000]
Yeah, she did lose a lot of weight, but she carries it to an extreme like last night

[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.200]
She didn't even want to eat forget what it was, but she didn't want to drink the water I think yeah

[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.340]
I think it canaries too many calories don't squeeze that lime in my water. There's calories in there

[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.140]
Don't you think she's lost enough weight? I think well she's she's on a carrying carpenter routine now

[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.700]
Yeah, I think she can go on with her life. I think she's lost the weight and

[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.380]
It's fine to me. Yeah, mom

[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.780]
Maybe she'll bring her boyfriend from her ex-boyfriend from Gainesville down. She promised me some great things last night

[00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.140]
But then again, I've had a lot of promises in my life and very few have ever materialized you know what I'm saying

[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.600]
Like in my house. Okay, where are we going right now? Let's go to date County. Hello

[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:14.980]
Yo, yes, sir Brian Wilson Jr. Here. Hey Brian. How you doing, baby? All right now. Are you pretty good? God only knows

[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.200]
I'm bored together. I you know we missed you the other night at the orange bowl. I bet you did well

[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.060]
I didn't want to get boot off the stage you know

[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.960]
Well, they got rid of David to Brenner pretty quick. crowd was a little surly

[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.760]
I have to mention Jose or as of his Latin orchestra. Yeah

[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.660]
You didn't care for the cut between your school, huh?

[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.720]
Did you?

[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.340]
No, wait a minute you misunderstand that's one of my all-time favorite songs, but that particular

[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.940]
Oh, I understand exactly which I mean I think what happened is

[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.480]
The original on to resemble the rendition that the Beach Boys do at a concert normally they bring out cheerleaders and stuff and oh

[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.380]
So they've kind of changed it around a lot. What a good excuse that is

[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.260]
Yeah, I want you to remember one thing. Mm-hmm. It has to be an old beat to be a classic

[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.300]
Not on Zeta

[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.860]
It has to be obscure to be a classic on Zeta

[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.440]
Listen, we really do enjoy your show. Keep up the good work. Thank you Brian

[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.460]
Boy boy

[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.560]
Peter Bulger in the other room just leafing through that music list looking at over. I'm scared. What does he mean by that? We play only the hits

[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.460]
Now you went over the music didn't you?

[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.340]
It cuts that nobody even the artists never heard of you. Did you point to him the one that artists have forgotten already?

[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.100]
I mean if it's a classic

[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.040]
Then it's immediately even a moron like me would recognize it immediately right

[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.280]
Even a jackass like me would recognize it if it was a true classic and he won't look at you

[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.000]
No, he's well. He's pretending that he's not listening

[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.240]
Playing hard to get he's laughing his brains up, but he's pretending that he's not listening and he just won't dignify us with

[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.880]
He's because he knows it's true. He's looking at the list and he's saying boy. He's right. These are one of a bunch of stiff records. He's worried

[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.380]
You know, let's let's start playing recognize

[00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.760]
I know it's a revolutionary idea, but was there something wrong with that that we play songs that people have heard before

[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.620]
I mean, it's not against the law even in Florida

[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.920]
Maybe maybe in Broward County

[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.080]
Nick Navarro doesn't like too much of that popular music. What is that is the egg loose again?

[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.860]
That's at the egg. What the hell are you doing? I just had something sitting here. Yeah, it sounds like he's got a being his bonnet or something

[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.400]
Yeah, can you can you tell what this is we knew you had to bug up your ear

[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.220]
You know, I don't think he has enough to do in that room. I think he's probably got a lot of spirit time

[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.160]
That's why he disappears for a long period of time now would be perfect wouldn't

[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:42.720]
That is the egg junior yet is. Mm-hmm. I like it. My right was at the egg junior. No, that's a human baby

[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:49.920]
I think we're all that's Greg that was his show the day after the book

[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.820]
That was his show the day after the book came out. Yeah, come on Greg be a sport, would you?

[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.740]
We haven't talked to them in so long and I guess so we probably won't be talking to them again soon at

[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.660]
It hurt. Well, I have an idea, but I don't know if I should say it on the air because we don't want to tip our hat

[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.100]
What's that how we could talk to agony really? How could we do that?

[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.340]
Well, if I tell it on the air and don't alert him then we won't be able to do what if I play a commercial and you guys can talk

[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.360]
Oh cake and I'll take tell it to you first off the air you're playing a commercial. Yes

[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.260]
Is that a signal? Is that against the law here at the Zeta?

[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.420]
Yeah, that's pretty revolutionary. She's good. I want to give you a list of this cap. Yeah, I've got to okay. You got to

[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.720]
Yes, I'm flexible. Well, when you got to you got to

[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:38.680]
It's the Neil Roger show on Zeta 4. Thank you Lee. Butch up a little will you pal?

[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.900]
It's 808 on Zeta 4 on a Friday morning and we've got a great letter here dear Neil Glenn and Captain Dave

[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.240]
Wow, are you ready for this? All right. It's addressed to all three of us. I'm sitting down

[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.520]
I'm too old to be a fan, but I'm certainly an appreciator my compliments and thanks to all three of you

[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.680]
You make mornings in the car tolerable. No downright pleasant. Mm-hmm, but

[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.320]
Oh, however, but now a complaint great

[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.980]
Too many butts in this town. You know what I'm saying? Too many butts. Yeah

[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.300]
Making light of criticisms of the Ville industry. Oh

[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.040]
Geez they got us

[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.660]
Can you believe that I would do that? Thank God. This is you guys

[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.600]
Because I'm not into locking up little baby cows either in the dark

[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.380]
With just feeding them bread and water. How about if we shine a flashlight in there

[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.640]
Yeah, that would be bad

[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.580]
Yes, of course slaughter is

[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.740]
rarely fun and games for the creature being slaughtered rarely

[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.700]
Well, what's in a while if they're into SNM

[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:48.540]
But I think poking fun at people asking others not to support the horrors of the meat industry is unfortunate speaking of unfortunate

[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.420]
There's Mark Cune

[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.960]
What does it say? I understand it might be just a joke

[00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:01.060]
What was so funny about that? Oh, sorry. Oh would you is this show disintegrating again right before my very ears

[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:07.860]
What was that song by Chicago right before my very ears? What was it? Yeah, you know the one I'm talking about that's it

[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.800]
Not today, my mom. I understand it might be just a joke or just a radio station

[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:18.880]
But that doesn't mean it isn't effective to be sure some of the nonsensical slogans of the animal rights groups seem to invite sarcasm

[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.000]
But there's that big butt again

[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.160]
But the horrors behind their drivel is very real real

[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:33.360]
I've toured several stockyards and slaughterhouses. I left a different person. I've toured several stockyards and slaughterhouses

[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.600]
That would be nice to find don't you find that little bizarre yeah like when they go on vacation

[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.780]
They tour like Omaha Chicago the stock yard. What a great day. What a hell of a way to spend vacation

[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.340]
It's like being back at doctors hospital on sunrise boulevard

[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.920]
By the way plantation middle school. I noticed the other day is right by that big stench

[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.560]
Really? And I think the parents and the students there ought to be a class action suit against the city of plantation

[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.220]
For that grotesque stench. It's there like it never goes away, man

[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.620]
Either that or maybe it's coming from the school

[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:09.020]
As I said, I think you show is the best thing to hit the airwaves in years and it goes on and on and on but um

[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:15.160]
However, I do hope you'll take seriously my suggestion that this is not something to support with humor

[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.000]
You

[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.960]
Now would you put your gerbil away please just relax oh that was the llama it did sound like that was sounded like the dolly llama to me anyway

[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.860]
You know, this is this is so ridiculous in fact

[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.140]
I'm gonna go out and have some vio Parmesan a Jamie and Marseys house this weekend

[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.460]
Just out of spite

[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.540]
Parmesan yeah, like we just they somebody we know would say yeah, you know who that is

[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.120]
Feel that way well, maybe a good to play to Ville Marseille

[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:55.660]
I would make me feel that way, you know or Ville Piccata or Ville French a sounds good. Oh, I love my Ville boy

[00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.900]
Don't take my Ville I don't give a damn there baby cause or what they are you know you hypocrites out there like when you eat seafood

[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:07.780]
Are you worried about like the stone crabs? I mean once upon a time they were alive they were falling there still alive

[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.560]
The stone crabs their claws are clipped off and they grow new ones. Oh, that's right. They only clip one claw

[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:19.360]
Oh, and I'm sure that the rest of them just they just turn them loose right they don't leave them in the dark and lock them up

[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.100]
No, they put them in boiling water

[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.920]
Speaking of being left in the dark. I think they put them in boiling water. Yeah, here's Gary Lauren speaking of in the dark

[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:31.640]
Now he's not here yet. Don't write it down. If he wrote it down cross it out or erase it. Okay. He's not here yet

[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.420]
He probably won't show today, you know

[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.600]
Wouldn't surprise me. Oh, yeah, you know him

[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.080]
Anyway, no, it's just like all these other things that you eat that were once living like all you

[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.160]
Suza there with your escargo

[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:43.920]
Snails

[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.240]
Oh, by the way, I was gonna buy one of those but I wasn't sure how far an escar goes

[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.540]
You like you like snail I asked the a dealer that how far does an escar go?

[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.180]
That's a coin. He said it goes at a snail's pay

[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.800]
I didn't have a laugh cute up sorry

[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:09.580]
Well, I'm glad you didn't because why should you be the only one? Okay, it's eight eight thirteen on zeta four and those phones man

[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:15.040]
Have been just sizzling today, you know, it's still yeah, it looks like a veal Parmesan platter it sizzling so hot

[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.400]
We need a little marinara sauce on there a little uh Parmesan cheese

[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:26.540]
Would use now this is not the Jeff Gonser show would you cut that out didn't you see what that stuff did for him or be the book?

[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.940]
I've been begging I've been begging Gonser get rid of that corny crap haven't I did I beg him?

[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:37.000]
I plead with him on the air. Well, not listen to me the man will just not listen. He hasn't learned

[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.340]
I mean maybe that cornball crap makes it big in LA okay like an anaheim perhaps

[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:46.600]
Well, that's kind of a Mickey Mouse part of the city, you know, it's it's Friday. We never use sound effects

[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.380]
Well, let's let's not start now. I'm so glad you found it okay

[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:55.920]
In fact, why not wander around the rest of the building and see where they can be put to the best use like on the AM

[00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:02.240]
Hey, there's an idea. Yeah, Mickey might like that absolutely go right up there on the AM and just dazzle them with BS

[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.800]
It's well there are a couple of people already doing that 814 on Zeta 4. Let's go back to the call

[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.940]
Shall we because we've been remiss again? Yes, yeah, been over there in a while. Broward County. Hello

[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:17.640]
Good morning Uncle Neil. Yes, ma'am. This is the statue lady junior. Oh, I got your picture this morning. It was just ravishing

[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.580]
Yeah, it looked like Larry Kent and drag

[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:24.440]
I think I need to go on a diet though. I would think so. Yeah a little too many of those chocolates

[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.100]
Listen, are you still on for breakfast Monday?

[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.160]
You're coming Monday. Yeah, didn't you get my note? No

[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.520]
And my check for the Camilla's house. Oh, is that from you? I haven't read it yet. I got the check

[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.720]
I pulled that check out of there so we could send it out right here's your note right here

[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:47.000]
Fallen angel. Yeah, oh, yes. Oh, I see. Yeah, don't say that

[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.220]
Oh, I got you and they haven't closed you up yet, huh

[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.620]
Yeah, I'm not

[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.360]
Closed everybody else up in Broward. I know that's because they want to steal all their material

[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.400]
You know what I'm saying? I think like Nick Navarro has got about 600 porno movies at his house

[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.080]
You know what I'm saying? He has a special there for you

[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.780]
Some Jeff striker does he really?

[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.120]
Probably got Jeff striker locked up in his house

[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.040]
Anyway, let's say congratulations hit him hard for a raise you deserve it

[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.700]
Isn't it interesting that she wrote that in the first sentence boy because if anybody needs it and deserves it

[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.160]
You know like I said the other day even if you're an elephant you can only work for peanuts so long

[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.880]
It's a word that letter I got today said the same thing. Yeah, it's it's overdue the audience is demanding and

[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:33.700]
That's the honey into the man. We're gonna start to be demanding too. Okay enough of this little league BS. Okay

[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:42.060]
Listen, I want uh, I know you don't like fish. I think you don't anyway. Mm-hmm

[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:47.900]
Let's gonna make a salmon move which is well. That's good. I'm glad a salmon moves. Yeah, how about bowling cool moose

[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.780]
Either one

[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.100]
How about some chocolate moose

[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.100]
Well, that's better than I will not eat the salmon. I'll just tell you that right up front

[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:01.940]
I thought that's fine. That's fine. That all right. Oh, yeah

[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:10.060]
I just love our fresh fruits. Yeah, yeah, I know and I what is that go test drink you like

[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:17.120]
Cherry seven up diet cherry cherry well can be diet anything. I'm off of that. I haven't had any of that in a long time

[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.700]
Oh, all right any kind of diet

[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.800]
Cola that's fine. Okay. I will be in there with my

[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.640]
$700,000 portion nine twenty eight grade

[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.200]
738 in the morning. We'll be looking for you. See you then. Bye. Bye. All right

[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.420]
That's great and that nice to know that on Monday we're gonna get taken care of. Mm-hmm. So to speak

[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:39.360]
It's 816 on Zeta 4 and Captain David Curses doing his usual tour of the building

[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.400]
Okay, here we go. Oh, well, at least this time maybe it might have been worthwhile his trip down there under the building

[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.120]
How is everything down there Captain David did you see I said good morning to Mr.

[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.700]
Mark. Oh Mr. Mark. Mr. Mark. Mark in the dark

[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.940]
Sort of our nickname for Tom. How much you like this car?

[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.240]
Uh

[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.560]
This is great

[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.680]
Well, it has to do with legs and fruit and all that

[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:12.580]
Wait till you hear this a committee. I thought there was a misprint, but it turns out that this is right a committee of canker experts

[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:25.500]
Can you imagine do you know any canker experts not not personally is meeting at Lake Alfred today to consider whether lift the ban on importing Florida fruit to other citrus states

[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.960]
Gee, and I just got back from California

[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:34.680]
Such shipments have been embargo to prevent the spread of what was to be taken what was taken to be a virulent strain of

[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.540]
Asiatic citrus canker

[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.500]
Millions that's with an M it says

[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:47.800]
Millions of young trees were burned in an in-state eradication program right scientists now say the citrus may have had a milder form of canker

[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.520]
Which does no more than blemish the fruit

[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.400]
So if you have a blemished fruit in your house

[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.200]
Said it to California

[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.060]
Because it'll be welcome with open arms

[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.020]
It's what the hell did you give me that for what was that supposed to be with

[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:08.200]
Like story I thought it was absolutely and of course if you've pushed in the lake and you have a canker

[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.560]
There's probably a good reason for it

[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.500]
It's 18 past eight on zeta four. We're gonna be doing a break right about now

[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:20.540]
But captain David courses in here playing with the news stuff again, you know, he just gets so excited playing with that garbage

[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:25.080]
I thought maybe this hour we could get a little bit ahead of ourselves not for the lady who got all or the guy

[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:29.060]
I guess this is a guy who got all upset about the veal and took it so seriously

[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:30.780]
Hello

[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:36.240]
Mr. Ed and if you got a beef with red meat

[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.500]
Maybe you should try the meat that's been around the track a few times

[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.480]
right will burn

[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:49.080]
That's right Ed real people like real food, but beef can be real expensive

[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:54.100]
So why not saddle up a steaming plate full of horse

[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:54.680]
Ah

[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.720]
There's lots of ways to prepare your pony why not try stuff trigger

[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.880]
Philly Phale or sauteed high oh silver and what are you

[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:07.780]
Will

[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.140]
This why it's my lunch flicking

[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:16.460]
And this three ounce serving of stallion has only one

[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:22.380]
200 calories so use your horse sings eat me

[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:27.060]
First message brought to you by the hoist council new trish's horse

[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.600]
But meat you can bet on

[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.800]
Don't forget post time on a clock at golf stream today

[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.940]
The preceding message was brought to you by Henry's hamburgers of East Lansing, Michigan

[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.720]
That's true. Is that a true story? What about Henry's yet is true when I went to school

[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.460]
They closed up the whole chain because they were serving horse meat and it was delicious

[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:49.820]
You know these these hypocrites like the other night were at the Melding pot with that big rating celebration

[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.800]
You know like the AM only went down a point in a half or whatever and

[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.240]
We're there with that big party and there are always these certain people in there who will not eat meat

[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.720]
Okay, and it's not bad enough that they won't do it

[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.960]
But they got to make a big announcement a big timmis out of it if you don't want to eat meat fine

[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.820]
Don't eat meat, but don't stand up and like make a big announcement and stand there like a lunatic

[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:13.620]
I'm gonna be impressed like Gary Lawrence and Gonzer and I think there were one or two others

[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.700]
Oh, we don't gonna eat the red beer here take the red meat

[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.540]
You know that kind of stuff who the hell cares

[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.160]
It's like it's gonna impress us. Yeah, and you know, I think when they leave they head out for the char hut

[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.840]
McDonald's yeah, I guarantee you those are the kind of people that sneak you know on the side

[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:32.620]
They go through the drive-thru and they get like 16 hamburgers to go I saw Gary on his bicycle at

[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.560]
It's a matter of fact just desperate for that big Mac okay

[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.660]
20 minutes after rate on say to four now. Let's see are we gonna do the break now?

[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.380]
Or did we already do it man? The show is going so fast. I can't I can't keep up with it

[00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:47.290]
Oh

[00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:51.390]
Isn't that kind of amazing and I see that one sounds different because it is different

[00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:56.030]
That's original from goodbye yellow brick road. Oh, but you don't mind hearing that because it's different

[00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:59.770]
But it better is right. I think you're right. I like that a lot sounds great. Yeah

[00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.930]
So what did they do they kept in Dave didn't get upset that we played that this morning?

[00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.930]
Which is astonishing. I think it's a pretty song, but you know

[00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:12.110]
But that version it's at least a little variety. Okay, so I figured you wouldn't get upset because it's not it's different

[00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.490]
Just as the last song we have such a variety to choose from

[00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:18.090]
That I think using that all the time

[00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:23.510]
You know we we used it once okay at the end of the show once two times

[00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:27.590]
I just did it three times you're absolutely out of your cotton pick and mind okay

[00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:31.410]
We never we played a couple of Elton John songs at the end, but not that one we did it once

[00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:40.670]
Okay, there he is suffering from that plantation mentality ladies and gentlemen. That's captain Dave

[00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:44.970]
28 minutes past eight on say to four now what we're gonna do before you did your attend bundy thing

[00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.410]
I had something very important

[00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:51.990]
But I was gonna do and you distracted me now. I don't know what I were gonna talk about the punch toast

[00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:57.550]
We had a whole thing we were discussing during that song and I think it bears no it does it bears bringing this out on a year

[00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.070]
Because it's embarrassing and it goes to show you the lack of respect

[00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:05.990]
That we get in this building. Oh, yeah, that's true back in the summer. Okay, when the spring rating book came out

[00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:09.950]
And somebody I know had a nine share in midday on w.i.nz

[00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:11.890]
Somebody we all know

[00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:19.510]
Uh, and the station had a six point eight share which is almost unheard of in the modern modern anals of radio broadcast history

[00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:24.370]
I miss market per a m talk exactly English language and there was no

[00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.330]
Yeah punch toast. There was no celebration no dinner in fact

[00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:33.890]
You and I had to go out pick up pizzas. We brought it back and sarcastically suggested that that was our celebration party

[00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:39.990]
Now that the a m has gone down from a five to a three nine, which is a rather staggering drop

[00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.770]
They're celebrating

[00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:47.310]
They're having a shell abrasion they had a dinner. Yeah, I'm at a dinner and they're having a punch toast

[00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:51.210]
I'll tell you the kind of punch toast that they ought to have up at that end of the building

[00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:55.910]
You know what I mean like a rocky marciano punch, but you see the mistake we made and what is that we did too good

[00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:00.150]
We did too well and that we didn't want it and suck up to the PD is that what I was they didn't wanted it

[00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:04.090]
We did not suck up to management and therefore if I would have had a 90 share they still would have said

[00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.050]
Right like they always do what would they have said

[00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.930]
Ha ha ha

[00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.990]
Nice reading like like the president said at the White House the other

[00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:19.490]
I don't have that on a CD. Okay, you know, well the president's gonna put it out on single

[00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:24.930]
So that'll probably wind up on compact disc. Oh good. It's 830. Yeah, Ronald Reagan's greatest hits

[00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:32.650]
Oh boy, I wonder if I wonder if he got that from Japanese Prime Minister Taka

[00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:36.970]
Oh, I can't say what what Taka Shita just spelled the name. No, don't spell

[00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:41.670]
That's what I was not interesting. It's one of those that you can say, but you can't spell

[00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:46.710]
Usually it's the other way around you might be able to spell it, but you don't get away with saying it

[00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.350]
It's sort of in the same genre as sheight

[00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:57.530]
Dade County hello. All right Neil. Yes, sir. Hi, it's Jamie. How are you Jamie? Isn't this amazing boy?

[00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:59.110]
All you gotta do is mention the real promise you on

[00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.770]
Yeah, I heard you were gonna come to dinner to kind of excited us

[00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:08.530]
Well don't get to don't get your hopes up now. Yeah, it was just a joke as Jay would say

[00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.250]
I'll take it that way you heard we won the lottery right? No

[00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.870]
Well, I'll tell you something it didn't come a minute too soon because I just got the bill for your gold chain

[00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:20.550]
What would you mean I heard you won the lottery? Where would I have heard that? Was it in the paper? No

[00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:25.770]
Someone mentioned to me that you had discussed it. No, are you out of your mind? How would I know that in my psychic?

[00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:30.010]
I don't know. I someone said they mentioned you mentioned it on your show. Oh, yeah, right sure, huh?

[00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:35.450]
Maybe I'm wrong, but anyway, it was it was real lucky because like again, I got the bill for your gold chain and I have to pay for it

[00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.950]
Excellent. Well, I'm glad to keep your bills paid man. It's good to have good credit Jamie

Just wanted to check in and

[00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:50.450]
They you know great have a good time. Okay, say hi to Marcy for us now

[00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:51.490]
Yeah, I'm sorry listening

[00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:55.450]
Okay, if she gets a little more indigestion don't tell Stan about it because you know he starts. He's ugly rumors

[00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:57.870]
Okay, okay, bye bye

[00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:02.430]
Revenerage boy, you sound a little subdued today didn't he? Yeah, but if you know to stay plethora

[00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.470]
Of comments about things that we allegedly set on this show. Yeah, like about Wilmetco

[00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:11.650]
Now we did take a few shots in front of them yesterday because we don't want to disappoint them

[00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:17.150]
We don't want to let them down and that part is fascinating because the day on which we allegedly made took the shot

[00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.610]
We never even mentioned Wilmetco. I mean what what in God's name?

[00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:24.490]
Would we be talking about Wilmetco for what is there to say? What is there to say?

[00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:29.410]
I mean they used to own channel four they run a bunch of movie theaters and they own a sequerium. Yeah, what else?

[00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:35.550]
What else is there to say? I've got some people there who are thin skinned and paranoid. I have no feelings one way or the other about

[00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:36.130]
No, I don't

[00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.810]
In other words when I go home and I put my head down in the pillow. I don't think that was bastard

[00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:44.230]
Oh, I like to get a terrible move. Although you know, not that I think about it

[00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:46.410]
Yeah, they do show those

[00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:51.790]
Crows before the movies you know the crows at the yeah, yeah at the snack bar, you know

[00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:59.830]
No that short yeah, they show it before every damn movie. I am so sick of the crows

[00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:01.610]
Yeah, into a movie in ages

[00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:05.430]
As a matter of fact when it comes to Wilmetco, there's only one sound I think of

[00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:08.970]
The Santa Cruz

[00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:13.390]
By the way, somebody said that there were chicken hawks flying over yesterday over the

[00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:14.530]
House

[00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.550]
Vultures chicken hawks chicken hawks

[00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.970]
And of course

[00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:24.530]
Mike Thompson's listening he's probably got an idea about those chicken hawks but that's that man

[00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:28.570]
I'm telling you so obsessed he is so obsessed yeah, we got some dogs here. Yeah, I'll listen

[00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.830]
Now I'm talking to the little dog where he got the little black one

[00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:37.050]
Don't be led down the garden path by the big one because he's a he's a shill for the Santa Maria people

[00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:40.510]
No, seriously he goes out and he gets other dogs in the neighborhood and he you know

[00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.130]
Be friends them and he gets them to follow him up to the Santa Rhea House and they're never seen again

[00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:45.510]
Exactly

[00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:50.030]
Okay, okay, leave a Ville Rogers alone. What do you play?

[00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:09.290]
You know just out of spite for these militant

[00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:13.370]
Animal fanatic people I think I'm gonna change it to the Ville Rogers show

[00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:19.030]
Official hell of an idea. Yeah, I think I'm gonna make it official. I might even change my name to Ville Rogers. Oh good

[00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.270]
I like that kind of thing. I mean the pirates used to have a picture Bob Ville

[00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.990]

[00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.430]

Why don't you see what baseball game is he talking to hurricanes? They're gonna know then just a few weeks. They're gonna start playing

[00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:56.850]
Have they invited you to announce any of them? No, that I'm not doing it this year

[00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.590]
I did it last year on a channel whatever that was 33 but they don't have the games this year

[00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.970]
They're gonna be a ten they wanted to use some yeah tennis got it

[00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:07.010]
So they wanted to use some of their real expert people like Cambrale Marshall right martian spaceman

[00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.270]

[00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:21.770]

Even the dogs are depressed now look at that the dogs are trying to commit suicide ladies and gentlemen

[00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:34.030]
Lasseter just drove into parking lot and they're they're banging themselves against trees

[00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:42.570]
Look at that. It's the man flasher. Who was that I know we just got flat was it? I don't know. Oh, it was um. It's Don Johnson

[00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:46.190]
Oh, it's not Don junior. Is it Don junior?

[00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.310]
Say it isn't so please say it isn't Don junior

[00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:54.490]
Did you see it? I didn't I didn't see it wasn't in front of my window thank god. I didn't see anything well

[00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:58.870]
Now what was that they just drove away? He came up he flashed at the window. He just drove away

[00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:02.750]
Well, we like that people that and he was looking at Captain David noticed when he was flashing

[00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.390]
He can't see through those windows from the outside. Thank god

[00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:10.450]
But you were looking in the right window pal because if there's anybody in this building who's into that stuff

[00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:12.250]
That was in front of your window

[00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:17.230]
Yeah, but he was looking at you but I couldn't see I've got a I'm like 100 feet away from you guys

[00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:22.370]

And he let him right down a garden pan they must have a dog whistle in that

[00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:42.270]
I got a great line for that boy. I just I'm not gonna do it. Okay. I'm not gonna do it today is not the day

[00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:47.970]
Test my luck. Well, I didn't know they're so damn scared in this place. I'm so sick of it already another scared of their own shadow

[00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:52.030]
In fact, it's a good thing Lamont crantzen's not alive anymore. They'd be scared of him too

[00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:54.430]
I'm serious. They're scared of every shadow

[00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:59.750]
It's 8.30 says well I had to say that because there are a lot of young people who have no idea who Lamont crantzen

[00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.050]
He used to play okay all you young idiots

[00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.810]
Lamont crantzen used to play the shadow

[00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:09.850]
On radio many years ago when radio you stave all these now look at that they turn around and they came back in again now

[00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:11.930]
They're driving down the other end of the building. Who are those guys?

[00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:14.470]
Don't you find that little bit?

[00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:21.070]
What he did or anything I just saw him pull up and it looked like a drove out and now they turned around and they drove back in did he really?

[00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:26.590]
So no, no tell me that was Don Jr. Please I beg of you. I don't know. Did he really flash? Yeah?

[00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:31.350]
Well that wasn't him that was somebody else but he came and he flashed but there was close on thank god

Thank god. I mean I'll let you know when I see you I'll let you know if I want you to flash you're not okay

[00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:41.070]
And believe me in your case pal forget it no chances

[00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.910]

[00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:54.230]
That was good. I was clever wasn't like that. Well, I have a facile mind. That would have been good

[00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.410]

Not too much fat. Yeah kind of lean like feel. Yeah like feel low and fat

[00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.870]
In fact, we ought to start encouraging people to eat lots of veal

It doesn't have all of fat and cholesterol of regular red beef that's right now come on. No, that's serious

[00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:39.850]
It's very lean and low and fat

[00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:45.810]
It's much better tasty and they you know great dishes like veal marsalah

[00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:50.250]
I mean if it's good enough for all those European connoisseurs, it's certainly good enough for us isn't it

[00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:51.730]
Connoisseurs

[00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:52.530]

They are going nuts with those damn lottery tickets tonight

[00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:38.370]
Everywhere by the way, why don't send a special tribute for consistency to Jack Eckerd, okay?

[00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:38.930]
Mr

Anti gambling remember he was one of the big hot

[00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:48.790]
Yes, now we know why the evils of gambling oh jack mr. religion mr. piety doesn't want you to gamble because it's immoral

[00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:56.110]
It's sinful all I crap and who is the first one of the first people just chopping at the bit to get their nickel on every dollar for every lottery ticket

[00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.610]
They sell

[00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:00.970]
Eckerds ladies and gentlemen what a hypocritical ass, okay

[00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:06.770]
You're right. Yeah, absolutely everybody likes a little ass, but nobody nobody likes a hypocritical ass

[00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:12.990]
Well, let me right Jack let me do the traffic quickly for four car accident northbound 95 just north of Griffin

[00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:16.950]
And southbound 95 we have a tanker truck

[00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:24.090]
Uh north of the golden glades in a car in an accident and cap day one to me to mention again the term pack is closed in Martin County

[00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:31.170]
Between Stewart and port St. Lucy with a spectacular crash this morning and 18 Wheeler in that car in the canal

[00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:38.250]
Okay, we should mention again classic album replacement weekend starts at noon today on zeta 4 and you ask what the hell is this

[00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:43.710]
Please shape it and thing all about well if you're albums. I mean records you remember phone to graph records

[00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:45.050]
I know that's a little antique

[00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:46.670]
But if they're getting scratchy and worn out

[00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:51.310]
All the other zeta personality to say the other because we don't get involved in that kind of stuff on the morning show

[00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:53.170]
We're not going to demean ourselves to give stuff away

[00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:55.170]
But the rest of the day they're going to be giving away

[00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:58.470]
Compact discs to replace your worn-out scratchy albums

[00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.810]
So how how was it that they say listen to win?

[00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:05.170]
Something some corny thing like that. Yeah, some cliche. Yeah

[00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:10.770]
Okay, now Ted Bundy well, this is a this is January 15th and this is a big day in history

[00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:15.710]
Now there's three major things that happened on this day one Martin Luther King was born on this day in Atlanta

[00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:23.710]
Okay, in 1929 now in 1967 was the first super bowl now do you have a clue who played in the first super bowl?

[00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:28.770]
The Kansas City Chiefs that's correct green but green bay patterns absolutely right. Packers destroyed him

[00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:33.550]
That's right 35 to 10 right. It was the first super bowl. However, the Kansas City Chiefs did beat Minnesota Vikings

[00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:36.050]
Either the next year or the year after that. Was it the next year?

[00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:39.770]
Second year, I think it was a second one. I'm impressed that you knew that. Oh, yeah

[00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:43.290]
All of Vikings have always lost the super bowl. Okay. Although this year they got a chance

[00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:46.530]
I will say that they're looking pretty good and also in the state in 1978

[00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.450]
10 years ago

[00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.390]
Uh, the chicken. What is that chicken?

[00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:57.250]
Looking good cooking good on the state also in 1978 two Florida State University students were murdered in their sorority house

[00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:02.390]
And that was the famous Ted Bundy did that and he was convicted of that crime and that was how long ago?

[00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:08.350]
10 years ago today and we're still feeding the uh, yes, we are now. What was that? Well this this time it seemed appropriate somehow

[00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:14.890]
But he's still alive. Was that was that the sound of the door opening in the death chamber at Rayford could have been

[00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:20.750]
Could have been but I doubted maybe maybe we ought to call up Larry can't see if her loneliness the big chair

[00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.670]
Hey

[00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:45.990]
Oh

[00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.910]

[00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:09.850]
Five, five on me

[00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:15.150]
One you can love and understand

[00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:21.770]
And then, boy, that chair is really gonna grab

[00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:24.110]
Yeah!

[00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.610]
So I could know, throw the switch

[00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:32.550]
Now it's time, watch it, switch on and deep

[00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:35.630]
Five, five

[00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.890]
Five, five, 13 till nine on Zeta 4

[00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:49.850]
Where were we going? You stepped all over that two by the way

[00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:51.970]
Yeah, but everybody got it

[00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:53.250]
It didn't matter if I stepped up

[00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:54.130]
Did they was it love or not?

[00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.490]
Oh yeah

[00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:55.730]
The level was high enough

[00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:57.110]
There's Richard Taylor just came in

[00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:59.350]
I thought he was driving a candle like the last time we saw him

[00:35:59.350 --> 00:35:59.930]
Is that Rasta?

[00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:01.770]
There's Rasta, do you just throw up?

[00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:02.570]
I'm serious, didn't he?

[00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:06.230]
He was he driving a... he'd be driving a potty act or something this time

[00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.990]
A couple days, yeah

[00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.690]
What do you mean?

[00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:10.310]
You're right, but it's changed again

[00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.890]
But he doesn't come in and talk to us anymore so we don't know what's going on

[00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:14.310]
Oh, that's okay

[00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:18.510]
That's okay, because he's turned into a like a Hasidic Jewel

[00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.170]
So he's become militant in the wild

[00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:23.330]
And he wears that crazy braided Yarmulka

[00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.170]
Those dreadlocks, he's a crazy man

[00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:28.610]
Okay, 12 minutes before nine on Zeta 4

[00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:30.490]
And let's go to Dave County again

[00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:30.810]
Hello

[00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:32.290]
Good morning, Dale

[00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:32.910]
Yes, sir

[00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.290]
I'm glad you're back

[00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:36.030]
Those two birds couldn't find me

[00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.110]
Now, come on, come on

[00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:39.170]
You don't knock the fillings, okay?

[00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:40.490]
Just leave them alone

[00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:42.970]
Be nice, I mean, you know, what the hell else would we have done?

[00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:45.630]
They tell me that you have run around Sue

[00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:48.010]
But they don't have it in your life, Barry

[00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:50.290]
I have it at home, I think, yeah, I'm sorry

[00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:52.690]
I thought you could bring that in one day and play it alongside

[00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:57.470]
I'll say, run around sugar, my favorite

[00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:58.350]
Yeah, okay

[00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:00.190]
I might be compared to two sometimes

[00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:01.650]
All right

[00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:03.330]
I appreciate it

[00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:03.870]
Okay

[00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:05.450]
Okay, sir

[00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:07.230]
What happened to Dion by the way?

[00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:09.490]
That hasn't been in there, we couldn't find that

[00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:11.250]
What do you mean it hasn't been in there?

[00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:13.210]
He's been asking for this every day

[00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:15.290]
But we don't have it, we said that you had it at home

[00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:18.710]
Oh, not run around, Sue, what's the Dion record we have in here?

[00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:19.730]
I don't know

[00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.690]
Oh, the one that wasn't a hit?

[00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:23.850]
The one that wasn't a hit?

[00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.270]
You guys screw this whole thing

[00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:27.650]
We have not

[00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:29.710]
Throw anything out

[00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:32.470]
I don't know what that is

[00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:34.050]
That's remember the one he brought in

[00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:36.350]
It's called it has this real terminal title

[00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:38.650]
And he was saying that it was a real big hit

[00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:39.690]
It was a hit

[00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:41.090]
Where is it?

[00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:43.150]
We never saw that

[00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:45.150]
Oh, geez

[00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:51.410]
This is the first time it's been a week and a half since we did this

[00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:54.910]
And this is the first time that you got really, truly honestly miffed

[00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:55.890]
So that's pretty good

[00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:58.010]
Where is it?

[00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.550]
I don't know what you're talking about

[00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:03.810]
I'm looking over here

[00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:07.390]
Oral Roberts?

[00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:09.570]
Yeah, Oral Roberts, right, by Dion

[00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:11.790]
Idiots

[00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:13.710]
I don't know what you're talking about

[00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:14.710]
I'm not idea, sir

[00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.470]
Gonser brought me the damn cassette tape in, don't you remember?

[00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:19.710]
I remember it

[00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:20.490]
What was the cut?

[00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:21.530]
What record was that?

[00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:22.410]
Something about it

[00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:25.490]
Have a nice day, sir, but you got me all depressed now

[00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:26.810]
There was a girl's name

[00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:28.610]
Susan something

[00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:30.290]
Oh, get out of here, Susan

[00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:31.810]
Let me look at her

[00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:32.570]
I'm gonna be Susan

[00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:33.950]
You out of your mind?

[00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:35.050]
You nuts?

[00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:36.130]
Susan

[00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:38.710]
What the hell is he talking about?

[00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:40.710]
I'm no idea, I'm more in the dark now

[00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:42.570]
Than ever be for ever

[00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:46.110]
When the night has come

[00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:49.930]
And the land is dark

[00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:52.070]
Okay, that's what it was

[00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.450]
It was a musical tribute to River Phoenix

[00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:55.830]
Donna the Primadonna

[00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:57.230]
What the hell is he talking about?

[00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.670]
I remember that

[00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:58.310]
What is it?

[00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:59.530]
I never saw it in here

[00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:01.110]
I do now remember Donna
