[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.980]
That's right. What is I can't remember the title, but it's really good. I played it. I promise in stones. I need you tonight

[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.620]
Do you think that lead well? That's not getting to that now that's anything that lead you let's the only guy in his station

[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.080]

I saw that yes to my right is that's a black and white

[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.500]
Granny horrendous. Yeah, it makes no sense at all. They got the ellipse and the glass and as a matter of fact

[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.160]
I know who those lips might belong to

[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.120]
643 on Zeta 4

[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.680]
The Mick Jaggers looks are bigger than Dan Marino speaking of Dan Marino

[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.200]
He opened up that new Italian restaurant last night. Congratulations and all the free plugs. You got Dan all over TV

[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.660]
Channel 4 must have some kind of incestuous

[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.560]
Relationship with marino because man did they give him

[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.680]
Unbelievable free coverage like every day when a new restaurant opens its commonplace for all the local stations to give them like about a

[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.860]
Three-minute plug right? Where is it and to tell everybody how great the food is?

[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.720]
I'm not gonna tell anybody where it is. I missed or anything about it. Okay. Like he really needs the money. Yeah

[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.400]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.280]
Scrum I shouldn't say that. He's okay. He's a great quarterback and a wonderful guy and he's got big lips

[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.040]
It's a 12 before 7 on Zeta 4. Oh, I'm just I'm not into that like self-serving jump on the bandwagon

[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.520]
Let's raw raw for the sting and the

[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.220]
Hurrick. Did I say the sting? Yeah?

[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.420]
What is the name of the team again?

[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.460]
What team the basketball team all the heat? Oh the heat? No, what did I say the sting?

[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.400]
Well, it was our must be the concept coming up anyway

[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.680]
Or whatever it is the hurricanes all this other stuff the shill stuff, you know? Yeah, it's one thing to be an athletic supporter

[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.140]
But let's get serious. That is a good name though. Yeah, the sting. Why me staying better. Yeah, we better call the police

[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.100]
That's a better that's a better name. Okay. Should we take a call before the news?

[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.200]
Couple of lines open and day and of course as soon as I said that we're gonna play a five minute cut

[00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.480]
Almost everybody disappeared. You know, that's the way you people are you have no staying power anymore

[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.620]
Remember back in the early days of the show. I guess the novelty is worn off

[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.740]
Is that what it is? How loyal they used to be our boils in a list. They would hang on forever

[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.560]
Yeah to get to talk to us now. It's like it's playing a record

[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.560]
Scrum. That's like that kind of stuff. Yeah

[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.960]
We take one from Broward County sure hello. Hello. Hi

[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.740]
I've been trying to get a hold of you since you first came on the air in October

[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.520]
On the FM

[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.340]
Mm-hmm. He used to call you on the AM really with the ones from Rochester, New York and Canada

[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.100]
Agua area we used to call you. Mm-hmm. Let me tell you something that happened

[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.460]
We went to I love the reverb on the car. Yeah, that was a big mistake

[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.920]
That's right and we ordered some white hats and we had the mail to you direct from airfare

[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.060]
You know air freight. Yeah, what happened to them?

[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.720]
They were they were refused when we sent them there. Wow. Why is that I have no idea

[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.740]
It just said customer refused and we mailed them to the station customer refused

[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.240]
Yeah, oh, I'm not here. They weren't not by me

[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.560]
I may be not by you, but they were refused because that's what it said on the box. Oh, that's great

[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.980]
Is that was returned to us? Oh my god

[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.580]
Well listen, I thank you anyway for the sentiment and I wonder who the idiot was here that did that

[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.080]
Well, I don't know, but there was an idiot there that did and then we were a lot of idiots here

[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:22.300]
And then we weren't be it you know able to get a hold of you any because you had gone into the FM and every time we tried to call you

[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.280]
Align was busy

[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.800]
Hmm, but anyway, that's what happened and it was refused by somebody over there

[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.880]
And I just want you to know that we did do it for you while I appreciate the sentiment was there and that's what counts

[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.600]
But anyway, let me take something out. Yes

[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.940]
Somebody driving around in plantation with a driver's license

[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.980]
I mean, you know one of those license plates on the front. Mm-hmm. It's a Zeta 94 Neil Rogers

[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.760]
Wow, where did the hell they get that? I have no idea, but I saw it in plantation. It says now the Broward Mall

[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.400]
It says little Rogers on it. Yep. It's a Zeta 94 in the corner. Then it had Neil Rogers in the other corner

[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.800]
Hmm, but if you don't know where they're getting them. I have no idea. We don't we don't have them

[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.680]
They must have had that done themselves so they must be but they're just a couple of them in the Broward Mall a couple of them

[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.620]
Yeah, there was a big round the front of the

You know in front of their cars. Well somehow I feel really pretty stupid, you know, because I know nothing about that

[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.680]
Yeah, well, they're there. I'm sure that our promotion department knows nothing about it either because they're real stupid

[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.660]
Well, they're around trust me. Okay, listen have a great day and thanks again for the sentiment

[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.080]
It's not incredible look at that

[00:06:53.080 --> 00:07:00.200]
I just looked at Captain Dave when I said that and he just totally panicked everything they serve as cooked from scratch with only the freshest homemade ingredients and believe me

[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.600]
You're gonna taste the difference at Fiesta tacos tonight is taco night
