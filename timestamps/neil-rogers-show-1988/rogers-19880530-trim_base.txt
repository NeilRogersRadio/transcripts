[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.740]
It's the memorial day version of the Neurodgers show.

[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.100]
So stand up on your bed and salute.

[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.320]
Here comes that Braun star winner himself, Neurodgers.

[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.920]
Can I ask you a stupid question?

[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.100]
Let me say it again.

[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.260]
Can I ask you a stupid question?

[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.580]
Is there like to have the whole sentence on here?

[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.060]
What is that?

[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.620]
I just turned around a little.

[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.600]
Let's solve it for the first time.

[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.520]
Is that something where we like hang one of the engineers

[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.360]
from there or something?

[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.280]
It looks like it.

[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.560]
It looks like a news for me.

[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.480]
A patriotic symbol of some sort.

[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.360]
Yeah.

[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.020]
Well that is strange.

[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.180]
Maybe we could hang one of the management people from there, huh?

[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.880]
Let's take a poll and find out which one.

[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.440]
So anyway, it's 551, 9 minutes till 6.

[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.600]
And isn't this great?

[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.840]
Kimba is already on the door.

[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.540]
She knows full.

[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.000]
She realizes today is a holiday.

[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.240]
She's already probably on her way home.

[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.020]
No, she is.

[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.560]
She cannot tear herself away.

[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.880]
Well, that's because she heard a rumor that we were playing some

[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.180]
Aerosmith in the first few minutes here.

[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.600]
Yeah.

[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.780]
And she got his stare.

[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.640]
Didn't she?

[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.140]
Yes, she was excited.

[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.820]
She's got a big blow up now.

[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.500]
Steve Tyler that she's taking home with her.

[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.580]
I hope you have a wonderful morning and a great holiday, Kimba.

[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.840]
Okay, I bet you will.

[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.920]
It's 9 minutes before 6 on Zeta 4.

[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.840]
And there she goes.

[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.300]
One of the great Americans.

[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.460]
She really is, isn't she?

[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.280]
One of the unsung heroes of Zeta 4.

[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.460]
Everybody talks about all these other stiffs.

[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.780]
But nobody gives Kimba any credit.

[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.260]
That's right.

[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.520]
And she works those graveyard hours, these thankless, godless hours.

[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.720]
And they are thankless and godless.

[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.320]
Anyway, it's going to be a real crappy day.

[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.120]
So if you got any plans for today, forget it.

[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.560]
Okay.

[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.200]
This weather has got to stop, doesn't it?

[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.040]
When does it stop?

[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.100]
Uh, it's that time of year.

[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.880]
It's the rainy season.

[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.160]
What do you mean it's that time of the year?

[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.980]
I was thinking about that yesterday as the rain was just pouring down in my swimming pool,

[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.100]
which I haven't used for a week because it's raining every day.

[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.700]
And I was thinking, you know, this rainy season, it's just another con game that they

[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.020]
plan Florida to make an excuse for the crap weather.

[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.620]
It rains every day from May to November.

[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.160]
Yeah.

[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.460]
But not all day.

[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.940]
I'm not swimming yesterday.

[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.660]
Did you really?

[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.560]
Yeah, late in the day.

[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.780]
Usually it starts right there.

[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.420]
No, night swimming.

[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.900]
No, about 5pm.

[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.640]
It could have been 5pm.

[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.900]
Yeah.

[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.160]
It could have been.

[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.980]
It could have been.

[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.960]
It could have been.

[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.560]
It could have been.

[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.060]
It could have been.

[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.520]
It could have been.

[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.080]
It could have been.

[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.980]
It could have been.

[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.440]
It could have been.

[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.440]

[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.440]

[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.440]

[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.440]

[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.440]

[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.440]

[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.440]

[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.460]
It could have been.

[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.460]

[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.460]

[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.460]

[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.460]

[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.460]

[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.460]

[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.460]

[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.460]

[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.520]
It could have been.

[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.520]

[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.520]

[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.520]

[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.520]

[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.520]

[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.600]
It could have been.

[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.600]

[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.040]
It could have been.

[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.040]

[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.060]
It could have been.

[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.460]
Well, some...

[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.740]
Well, you know, Peter Moon is pretty busy in there over there.

[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.900]
Right.

[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.240]
Now, what is it that he does?

[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.720]
It seems like the same thing Kimba does.

[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.960]
No.

[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.180]
A little differently than the last thing.

[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.060]
No, I don't think so.

[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.780]
No, I mean, what is it that he does that keeps him so occupied that he doesn't have time

[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.600]
to pull the spots and do that just the common courtesy stuff that one person does for

[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.780]
the next one in this business?

[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.580]
Well, you've...

[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.480]
No, you've talked to some of those women.

[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.420]
You've talked to some of those Peter Moon women.

[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.780]
Oh, I mean, he shmooses on the phone with some of these sluts.

[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.600]
Is that what you're saying?

[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.460]
I didn't say any of that.

[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.840]
You've talked to some of them.

[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.200]
Some of these desperate sluts?

[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.300]
Desperate.

[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.600]
Anyway, it's $553.

[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.560]
We don't want to get into that because we've got a lot of important things to do here today.

[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.120]
I can't for the life of me figure out more of them.

[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.980]
I can't even.

[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.000]
Most of all, I can't figure out why we're here.

[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.340]
So few people don't call today.

[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.240]
You're really going to get it.

[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.900]
Okay, because it's a holiday and they said, now, that goes to Shoe that I'm mentally here.

[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.320]
Right?

[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.720]
I'm not well because when they offer you the day off and you say, oh no, we'll all be there.

[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.540]
There's going to be something basically.

[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.700]
You always do that.

[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.560]
Now, you've always...

[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.400]
Well, I don't like to be beholden to them.

[00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.040]
Well, you...

[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.460]
I don't like them acting as though we owe them something.

[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.980]
Oh.

[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.100]
You know what I mean?

[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.720]
Is that a good idea?

[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.080]
If you do take the day off, see this way you kind of like store up when you really do want to take the day off.

[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.320]
Oh, you have a reserve.

[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.940]
Exactly.

[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.840]
Rather than a crawl out the reserve as a matter of fact, even big Davis here this morning, which is pretty exciting.

[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.220]
Yeah, it is.

[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.600]
Yeah.

[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.140]
I have a figure of a story to tell you.

[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.660]
You do?

[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.140]
Wow.

[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.620]
This is the time, right?

[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.840]
Wow.

[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.760]
Okay, do it right now.

[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.940]
The four-fourth, six o'clock now.

[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.500]
Yeah.

[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.840]
Yeah.

[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.880]

[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.200]
After six o'clock, we can't tell who's kind of stirring.

[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.680]
That's right.

[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.460]
So now it's nothing dirty.

[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.940]
Oh, then let's save it.

[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.280]
Let's save it till some people are listening.

[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.200]
Okay, big Davis back from Hawaii, looking fit and chipper and why for God's sake, he isn't sleeping.

[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.180]
I have no idea.

[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.560]
It's only...

[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.080]
What is it?

[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.820]
Hawaii.

[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.800]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.300]
It's only been night and it's also partly cloudy and about 80 something.

[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.520]
And it's not raining either.

[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.780]
It's beautiful or trust me.

[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.520]
Okay, it doesn't...

[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.360]
They don't have a rainy season like this one.

[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.940]
They know?

[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.600]
They may have their own form of the rainy season, but not like this.

[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.080]
Now we're just pukes and pours down every single day.

[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.020]
It'll be okay.

[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.040]
For months in a row.

[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.600]
Trust me.

[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.100]
It'll be plenty of heat coming.

[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.200]
I don't...

[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.940]
That's not the point.

[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.920]
It's even hot when it rains, but the point is, at least have a little sunshine once in a while.

[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.460]
Yeah.

[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.800]
See, the winter months here are like December and January.

[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.140]
I don't mean winter, but like winter, the good months.

[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.160]
Starting the winter time.

[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.040]
It doesn't rain then.

[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.420]
Exactly.

[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.900]
But boy, once it starts getting into late May and where we are now, it rains every single day.

[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.660]
And it's depressing and gloomy.

[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.620]
You know, I was out yesterday afternoon.

[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.780]
I saw a billboard on Teltixie Highway and it said the lotto is now worth $20 million.

[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.280]
Did you see that billboard?

[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.340]
Well, nobody wanted Saturday.

[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.340]
Oh my God.

[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.740]
You know, $20, that's a lot of millions.

[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.180]
Oh, so in other words, you're going to go out and buy a bunch of tickets today?

[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.640]
I don't know, but it makes me think I should because...

[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.320]
Oh my God.

[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.300]
For the first time.

[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.900]
Oh.

[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.920]
Because somebody's going to win there.

[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.840]
I'd like to point something out to you.

[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.120]
Okay.

[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.280]
You're a champ when it was...

[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.540]
Remember when it was like $3 million and then it was $7 and then it went to $10 and then it was $12?

[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.240]
Your chance is now that it's $20 of winning.

[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.800]
Are not any better than in fact, they're a lot worse.

[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.440]
Okay.

[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.660]
Because a lot more people are going to be buying tickets.

[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.980]
So last week, they were $14 million to $1.

[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.480]
So let's say half again as many people go out and buy tickets because it's up to $20 million.

[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.500]
That means it'll be over $20 million to want against.

[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.380]
You're winning it.

[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.760]
Okay.

[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.320]
Now I understand that.

[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.140]
Probably like $30 million to want against.

[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.940]
But you have a better chance of walking out of this room into the general manager's office.

[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.860]
Finding a check for $2 million made out to you.

[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.140]
Then you do a winning that lot of money.

[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.480]
That's a hell of a way to put it.

[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.780]
Exactly.

[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.060]
You have a better chance of opening up your next paycheck and finding a $10 billion bonus

[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.960]
than you do of winning that lottery.

[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.820]
Yeah, but a $20 million to one chance of telling Gary Lawrence.

[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.620]
To go to hell.

[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.560]
To go to hell.

[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.160]
I mean, he's not a very nice way to put it.

[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.600]
You got to weigh these things, you know what I'm saying?

[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.120]
Yeah.

[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.000]
I had a different way to put it but federal law.

[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.660]
So him, it's even before 6 a second word was off.

[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:01.160]
I know that.

[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.260]
Yeah.

[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.300]
Anyway, it's three minutes before 6 on say to four.

[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.200]
And I just called and said that somebody won.

[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.880]
No, I saw the billboard yesterday afternoon, late afternoon.

[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.080]
Well, we don't know because we don't have a paper so we don't know any texture.

[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.280]
But I'm just saying I saw this billboard.

[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.160]
We don't have the scores though.

[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.660]
That's good.

[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.640]
Now that's a good start but we have no Harold.

[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.940]
And today being Monday, useless today doesn't print on a holiday.

[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.640]
That's correct.

[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.300]
Or on the weekend.

[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.720]
No.

[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.320]
Or on Sukkis or Tisha Buff.

[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.300]
When the hell do they print?

[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.900]
Well, now they do print on Tisha Buff.

[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.560]
Oh, do they?

[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.840]
Well, I know last year, but it's they were a little shaky getting here.

[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.760]
I know that last Friday.

[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.280]
That's right.

[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.900]
So anyway, here's the scoreboard.

[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.600]
The Lakers look like absolute garbage yesterday.

[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.100]
Okay, Dallas beat him 118 to 104 to tie up their series into a piece.

[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.100]
The NBA playoffs still have a long way to go.

[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:45.460]
Okay.

[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.580]
Oh, yeah.

[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.880]
Boston and Detroit today.

[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.240]
And of course, hockey is over.

[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.220]
I know that breaks your heart.

[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.000]
I don't believe that.

[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.900]
Although the college world series, I guess we should congratulate the hurricanes.

[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.760]
Somewhat.

[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.180]
They won the Atlantic Regional again.

[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.260]
But you know, Ron, I got to say this.

[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.440]
When you're playing toson state James Madison and Vassar,

[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.200]
there's got to be something a little bit that Ron Fraser has got a sense of humor

[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.120]
that's not to be, but they played teams with girls on it this weekend.

[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:08.560]
Okay.

[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.600]
I mean, let's get serious.

[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.680]
But anyway, they won to the go to Omaha again to the college world series.

[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.800]
We wish them a best of luck.

[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.420]
But you know, they're not going to be playing toson state up there.

[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.340]
Posting state.

[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.020]
Did you hear it here?

[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:21.680]
Is that just school?

[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.040]
No.

[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.940]
Neither did anybody else.

[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:24.800]
Never heard of.

[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.120]
This is why nobody showed up for games.

[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.860]
Now, now we do have the Serena football.

[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.060]
Yeah, that's coming up.

[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.000]
Yeah, a little bit.

[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.540]
All right.

[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.620]
Okay. Well, no, we don't want to lump them together.

[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.440]
We'll have a special school for those here.

[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.920]
The Major League baseball or what Sunday?

[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.340]
So that means we got a load of games.

[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.300]
Brewer 70 Indians 2 Toronto 4, the White Sox 3, the twins beat the Tiger 6 to 3.

[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.020]
Kansas State pound of the Daylights out of Texas 12 to 1.

[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.780]
Baltimore beat the Angels 3 to 2.

[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.580]
Oakland 5, the Red Sox 4 and the Yankees beat Seattle 7 to 3.

[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.200]
And actually Dodgers 2 Montreal won the Padres beat the Met 6 to 3.

[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.860]
He Phillies beat the Giants 4 to 2.

[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.660]
Cardinals beat the Braves 2 to 1.

[00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.040]
Pirates over the Reds 4 to 2.

[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.760]
The Pirates are only 3 and a half out, by the way.

[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.620]
I mentioned that in passing.

[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.260]
And the Astros beat the pathetic Cubs 7 to 1.

[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.220]
Okay, that's it.

[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.040]
So there's a scoreboard.

[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.620]
It's a minute before 6 on WZTA, Miami Beach and all the rest.

[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.920]
And today being a holiday, I promised that we would bring out a lot of old stuff today.

[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.180]
But first before we do that, what is he doing in there?

[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.940]
Is he doing something useful or is he just wondering?

[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:21.540]
Oh, there he is.

[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.220]
Excuse me, I just didn't see it.

[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.000]
All of these pictures have been moved or something.

[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:26.540]
Oh, I see it.

[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.040]
Just that they've moved the curtain in.

[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.700]
So they've narrowed down the view that we have.

[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.500]
You notice that?

[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.300]
What the hell were they doing in here this weekend?

[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.040]
There must have been something really raw to go on in that controller room.

[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:37.740]
Well, that classic.

[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.340]
When they have to close the blinds, yeah.

[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.320]
Something very bizarre was going on.

[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.060]
You know these rock, block party parties.

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.240]
Yeah, party parties.

[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.300]
By the way, the music was killer this weekend and the stay was incredible.

[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.200]
And tonight, from what is it seven o'clock in the night?

[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.460]
I know a lot better, but I don't have anything on it.

[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.760]
From seven o'clock in the night, we have the King Biscuit Flower Hour special

[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.960]
with all the best of the live concerts.

[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:00.560]
Uh-huh.

[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.480]
And we're going to be giving away some CD sets.

[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.440]
And also somebody's going to win a set and a CD player.

[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:06.540]
Right?

[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.220]
Did I get that right from the top of my head?

[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:08.800]
Sure did.

[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.500]
Well, I'm really sharp as a monster ball today, aren't I?

[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.740]
But it is kind of strange that there's nothing in here on it.

[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.940]
But that must be just an oversight.

[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.760]
I'm roast as part because he's got a lot of spirit time.

[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.320]
So anyway, I went out again and spent a lot more of my money this weekend.

[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.240]
Not again.

[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.040]
What did you get this time?

[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.740]
Well, no, I want you to stop and think about something.

[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.600]
He's agreed to program the 10 o'clock hour, this classic gold mine hour.

[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.320]
The only problem is we don't really have a lot of music in the library that fits in it.

[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.280]
So he's content to let me go out and keep spending my money.

[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.040]
And the station isn't doing anything to buy music that fits in there.

[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.440]
Of course, his idea of, you know, with Donovan, we do have Donovan.

[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.780]
Okay, but that's not exactly my idea.

[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.200]
It's alright because even some here.

[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:49.560]
Paul Revere.

[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.660]
We even have Paul Revere the Raiders on CD.

[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.820]
I just bought a look at that.

[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.860]
And he just mentioned that.

[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.820]
He must be getting cited.

[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.020]
And you'll really be pleased to know that I bought permanent vacation, the second copy,

[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.880]
just so I don't have to keep bringing it back home.

[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:01.480]
Oh, a backup.

[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.480]
Yeah, a backup.

[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.320]
Well, I got some incredible stuff here.

[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.540]
Got the Herman's Hermits.

[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.200]
Wow.

[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.000]
The BG's including nights on Broadway, the real thing on CD.

[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.260]
Rick Nelson on Compact, this, the original cuts,

[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.220]
classic rock with, you'll even like this,

[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.420]
Steely Danz on there and a bunch of other stuff.

[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.180]
Paul Revere and you're never going to believe this.

[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.940]
When she kissed me, I was born and she said goodbye.

[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.480]
Okay, Dion and Dion on the bell monster.

[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.660]
So many, the big day before we get all upset, but that's his problem because it's not a show.

[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.320]
When it gets his own show, we can do whatever he wants.

[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:34.700]
Okay.

[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.720]
But I just thought we'd run down a few of these real fans.

[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.260]
Great.

[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:40.820]
Real quick like.

[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:47.160]
If they ever start like at 602 on Zeta 4.

[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:53.000]
Each time we have a wall, it almost breaks my heart.

[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.140]
Oh, that's so clear.

[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:54.900]

[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.700]
And these are not the remakes by the time.

[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.760]
I'm sending the flare.

[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.140]
I don't know this one.

[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.140]
One must I love you so much.

[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:21.420]
Stand in the air for your touch.

[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.260]
I'll battle up the next time, standing up.

[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.460]
I've got to tell you that we're doing.

[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:27.560]
Wow.

[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.980]
Some of these I haven't heard yet.

[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:30.560]
I don't know.

[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.560]
You know, that like that last?

[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:31.900]
Yeah.

[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.620]
Wow, I got it.

[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.140]
Existed.

[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.000]
This is a good one for a captain day.

[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.740]
I'm just getting ready to keep playing with the second.

[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.240]
Yeah.

[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.740]
Playing it.

[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.460]
That sounds very clear.

[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:45.920]

[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.140]
I'm going to call it the neither of us.

[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.720]
I'm going to try out the men I squeeze them.

[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.760]
They don't even know my name.

[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.260]
They call me the wanderer.

[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.340]
They're the wanderer.

[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.540]
How much have I heard some of these in at least one, 50, 60 years?

[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.680]
I'm sure you hear these around your house, don't you?

[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:10.920]
Everyday.

[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.200]
Everyday.

[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.120]
Where are we?

[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.860]
Do you have this blank look on your face?

[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.440]
You don't know this side, do you?

[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.440]
Thank God.

[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.140]
You better not.

[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.300]
How about you having heard this, bitches?

[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.740]
All the solo Dion ones that were so good that a lot of us had forgotten about.

[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.260]
I like to tell you something all about me.

[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.840]
Look at him, the batter.

[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.100]
I wish today to wear my breath, what does that mean?

[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.120]
And say it does.

[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.020]
There's so much evil around us.

[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.760]
I feel that I could die.

[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.200]
And I know.

[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.540]
Yeah, that I was born and cry.

[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.500]
And if I ever told you all about it.

[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.420]
So anyway, let's put a stop on it right there.

[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:56.620]
We'll come back to the 604 on Z4 because there are like 18 cuts on here.

[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.560]
I'll wait till you get some of the later ones.

[00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.920]
Everybody's just going to freak out.

[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.340]
Great.

[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.320]
Now we do have a call on hold there, but I can't see the phone.

[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.940]
I can't see it because I've got all these things stacked up that we're going to play today.

[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:07.540]
Uh-huh.

[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.340]
So I'm not really going to worry about the phone.

[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:14.400]
For a starting last Monday, we started a whole new approach on this show and that is we don't really give a damn whether you call or not.

[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.780]
Which for me is like a miracle.

[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.820]
It broke a 12 year stranglehold by the phone.

[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.760]
And I've broken that.

[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.760]
I don't know what happened to me, but I just don't care anymore.

[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:24.840]
We had a good week.

[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.160]
I think partly as a result of that.

[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.800]
I mean, if they want to call for it, if not, we don't need them.

[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.320]
Some other shows should take that attitude.

[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:32.780]
Anything?

[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.140]
Yeah.

[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.200]
Some other show that accuses me of having that.

[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.120]
What does he call it?

[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.260]
That the busy signal complex or some damn thin drone?

[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.560]
I'm not out sticking car.

[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.320]
So anyway, in boy the way, he's going to be on for an enormous sum.

[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:46.760]
I'm nervous.

[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:47.800]
I heard about this.

[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:48.020]
Yeah.

[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:48.600]
10 to 6.

[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.000]
Yeah.

[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.100]
I don't know what that's all about.

[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.440]
I'm really worried about that.

[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:51.480]
I can't have that be.

[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.620]
I was thinking more like from 10 to 6 to 6 would be good for that show.

[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.660]
Because all the real material that they've got would fit in in those 10 minutes.

[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.900]
No, well, this allows plenty of time for the hooters.

[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.620]
Yeah, Brian Ferry, which is, yeah, I do this priest.

[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.980]
I think we need a couple of lots of things to do.

[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.040]
That makes it incomplete.

[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.100]
Anyway, 605 and Zeta 4.

[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.340]
Broward heating and air conditioning is in South Florida to stay since 1956.

[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.420]
Broward heating and air has served the fine folks of Broward, Palm Beach and Big County.

[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:25.480]
Probably even some folks who aren't so fine with the same ownership, quality and service.

[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:30.120]
And now is the time to escape the heat and humidity with a brand new air conditioner from Tempstar.

[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.160]
Tempstar air conditioning systems are designed for the future, but available now with advanced features,

[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.620]
advanced deficiencies, and a commodity size chip for your home or office.

[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.400]
Broward heating and air would like you to rely on the star Tempstar.

[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:51.260]
By Tempstar, cooling from now until July 15th, and Broward heating and air will throw in five years of worry-free parts and labor protection.

[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:57.420]
And when you tell them that Neil Rogers sent you, they'll also give you a free permanent static air filter with 125 bucks.

[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.880]
Just to mention my name. Broward heating and air serving west Palm to Miami,

[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:11.060]
column toll free 1-800-525-5045. That's 1-800-525-5045.

[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.060]
Okay. Okay. It will be mostly-

[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.260]
It will be mostly-

[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:15.260]

[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.240]
Lee Cloudy today.

[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.180]
Scattered showers and thunderstorms, 50% chance today.

[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.560]
I don't like that forecast. Can't you make up something a little better today?

[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:23.880]
I make up-

[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.040]
It's our holiday!

[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.880]
People have the day off they want to go out and barbeque.

[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:42.580]
Now-

[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:42.600]

[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:07.300]

[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:07.980]
Now-

[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:08.460]
Now-

[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:08.900]

[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.680]
Now-

[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:28.420]
So-

[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.840]
That was a Freudian slip. I ever did one, wasn't it?

[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.320]
The Boston Pistons!

[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.160]
It's 8 minutes after 6 onays 4. And I will give the numbers out. Just in case.

[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.800]
I don't imagine there are too many people awake this morning at this hour.

[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.220]
I'm sure nobody has to go to school right now.

[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.640]
Most people don't have to go to work except for us.

[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.820]
So a lot of people are sleeping in it.

[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.800]
Most people are sleeping out. They're not going to get up and call us at this hour.

[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:50.480]
And-

[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.640]
And I saw some on my way-

[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:51.680]
Right.

[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.100]
And I saw some on my way in that it obviously been up all night.

[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.040]
And we're just coming in just head coming maybe some people coming in you know

[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:03.680]
We can't show us like that where he had a really great first hour really when the hell was that I remember one other holiday

[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.080]
We worked in the first hour was great because we had all these people who had been up all night

[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.580]
Day I think when Glenn was on a vacation or something we were doing

[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.280]
Kasey went a great

[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:20.400]
When the stripper called she had just got off work a bunch of yeah, that was a good day

[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.420]
The phone may be worth checking I mean what do you mean well just see okay?

[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.980]
You want to take this first one here just for the hell of it? Hello?

[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.640]
Pretty good. What are you doing this morning?

[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:36.420]
Um actually we're friends trying to cut computer game. I have two things to you wait a minute at six o'clock in the morning

[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.760]
He's playing a computer game

[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.980]
These kids today I know

[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.040]
How old is your friend about ten

[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.820]
18 18 well, that's close. In other words, it easy 18 going on 11 right?

[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.940]
No, he's going on 20. Okay, whatever you say we'll humor him

[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:59.940]
Okay, whatever remember that scandal with Joey Reynolds what scandal?

[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:05.100]
So whatever happened to him you see back on the air is not hiding you won't be here in Joey again soon

[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.680]
Okay, Joey's like remember Ray Muland in the invisible man. Do you remember that movie?

[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.900]
Well, it's before your time, but anyway trust me Joey is a history as they say

[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:19.780]
Okay, and why are you guys actually on the air today shouldn't you be in like in bed sleeping or something?

[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.800]
I would think so. Yeah, I think as a matter of fact, it's not too late. I

[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.240]
Could be home by 6.35 with no problem at all

[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.420]
But aren't you happy that we're here though?

[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.820]
Isn't this kind of like a pubic servant? You don't sound too excited that we're here working on a holiday

[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.740]
I was affecting a tape of your show. Oh, would you rather hear a tape of the show?

[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.920]
At this hour who would care I see well, thanks a lot

[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.720]
I thought that you'd call say gee, it's really nice that you're working on a holiday for us and it's

[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.160]
How's actually nice to hear your voice live? You're gonna. Oh, I hear that well

[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.200]
It is in debt could be a lot closer if we well anyway listen have a wonderful holiday

[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.220]
Okay, you two take care of yourself now

[00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.560]
You two and tell your friend to boot you up a little will you?

[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.820]
Okay, bye-bye. Okay. Yeah, we're gonna put on all the stops today. We're gonna do a lot of really dirty stuff

[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.580]
It's 11 after 6 I

[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:10.440]
Just had to say that you know we're not but I just thought I would say it just to you know kind of like light a flicker of light

[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:16.820]
From the past yeah, yeah when we used to be able to say hello and goodbye without having people have committee meetings and bringing attorneys

[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.020]
Anyway, it's 11 past six on Zeta 4 and

[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.940]
I don't know we just play this stuff, huh?

[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.740]
Well, I didn't finish D on did I didn't finish D.I. We haven't heard Dave's story. You want to do the story?

[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.020]
Yeah, we're dying to hear it. It's little early. Okay. Well, you can notice

[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:39.600]
Preferences good. I didn't tell you about this yet. Did I know now you didn't tell me much of anything. Oh good

[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:45.820]
Anyway, let's see where did we finish all now number 10. Let's see. Where are we doing here?

[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.200]
For some reason this isn't planned

[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.020]
Oh, there it goes

[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.680]
Now I can hear this emanating from your house

[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.080]
About the windows

[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.400]
All over plantation

[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.140]
Oh

[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:18.920]
on

[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:24.980]
Oh

[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.360]
Justin here's the drum

[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.820]
I'm sure they are.

[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.360]
I also hear him rambling stuff in the back.

[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:40.220]
What's he doing?

[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.480]
He adds to the record.

[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.400]
He adds to the ambiance of the music.

[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.360]
I like it.

[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.760]
See how relatable.

[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.520]
Now this song is one of my all-time favorites.

[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.880]
Lovers who wander?

[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:03.440]
Aha.

[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.080]
Big hit.

[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.600]
Because I find that place for lovers who wander.

[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.400]
And then there's a lover's prayer and the still of the night, which is their...

[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.980]
It's not the same as the five saddens.

[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.580]
That's a different one.

[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.400]
I'm a little bit more...

[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.080]
And...

[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.900]
I couldn't use this.

[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.120]
You oughta skip that one.

[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:35.960]
Skip what one?

[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:36.960]
I mean make it skip.

[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:37.580]
Oh.

[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.760]
Oh yeah, four he goes.

[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.320]
You did that.

[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.020]
Okay, hold on.

[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.360]
I bet you haven't heard this in eternity.

[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.760]
This is a great record for me.

[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.240]
I would say in dog's days.

[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:49.400]
I hold.

[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.440]
I hold.

[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.600]
Well, Pearl's pretty old.

[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:54.560]
Yeah.

[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.740]
Little Diane.

[00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.600]
All right, because this...

[00:22:59.600 --> 00:22:59.760]
Yeah.

[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.180]
I think this was that kind of pan flute.

[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:03.800]
What's his name?

[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:04.680]
Some beer.

[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.080]
John's beer and a pan flute.

[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.580]
This was basically this morning on day 4.

[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.380]
Early in the spring.

[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.580]
Okay, let's go back to...

[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:17.400]
What?

[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:18.300]
I calm down now.

[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:20.760]
When she...

[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.160]
Oh, a turplop.

[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.520]
Oh, a turplop.

[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:24.520]

[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.160]
A turplop.

[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.240]
A turplop.

[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.420]
That's nice.

[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:30.400]

[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.460]
There you go.

[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.680]
So there's D on Didlan for you on the radio this morning.

[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.080]
615 and 1.

[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.400]
That's hearing that stuff just enough to make hair grow on my head

[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.320]
and all over my body.

[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:43.760]
It's great.

[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:44.840]
Huh?

[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.440]
Isn't that what I like this all about?

[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.020]
So anyway, 615 on Zeta 4.

[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:52.080]
And if you're lying there, I've been wondering just what the hell we're doing here...

[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.700]
Doing a live show on a holiday like this,

[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.260]
while everybody else is having the day off.

[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.360]
We are beginning to have the same...

[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.840]
And I guess no food today, right?

[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.100]
No, but tomorrow.

[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:00.760]
And I'm wondering, like this?

[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:01.540]
What's tomorrow?

[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.780]
Oh, Shells is bringing food tomorrow.

[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.960]
And then Thursday we got pizza coming from Newspaper Hearts.

[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.020]
Johnny G's gourmet pizza in the North Miami Beach.

[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.520]
And that sounds really good, too, by the way.

[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.720]
They've got some good stuff on here.

[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.880]
They even have pizzas with spinach and broccoli and chicken and bell peppers.

[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:26.920]
And Canadian bacon and sun-dried tomatoes and smoked provolone.

[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.420]
And red and yellow onions and fresh mushroom.

[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.380]
And today...

[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.500]
Yeah, like spinach pizza.

[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.720]
Yeah, sun-dried tomatoes.

[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:35.080]

[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.780]
So we're looking forward to that on Thursday.

[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.020]
It's going to be a big week of eating here on the show.

[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.680]
Which we haven't done in quite a while.

[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.380]
So we better go back into training, okay?

[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.900]
We got a couple of some great mail here, by the way.

[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.020]
And to show you the impact that this show has,

[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.740]
we have a whole packet of stuff from fan-frontthithco.

[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.380]
About.

[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.740]
And it's about the Veele, okay?

[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.040]
Oh, no.

[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.360]
Yeah, from the Humane Farming Association,

[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.200]
Dear Mr. Rogers, my purpose of writing is to say,

[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.460]
thanks, I understand you give a few plugs for our Time Magazine Veele advertisement

[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.820]
on your May 11th radio show.

[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.720]
Furthermore, I learned you've sworn off eating Veele.

[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.280]
Congratulations.

[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.500]
It's a nice letter.

[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.680]
And I got all this propaganda and all these sick-looking calves in here.

[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.760]
And these sand faces.

[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.660]
Oh, geez.

[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:18.580]
And look at this.

[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.900]
These guns are with a sad face.

[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.960]
And it's, while I guess he saw the book,

[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.440]
if you'd ever like to do a phone interview with our director,

[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.920]
Bradley Miller, please give me a call at so-and-so.

[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:31.060]
I'm certainly to appreciate the opportunity to speak in depth

[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.740]
on the crate-raised Veele issue.

[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:33.480]
The what?

[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.300]
Crate-raised Veele issue.

[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.460]
What's the one word?

[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.140]
It says in Veele Rogers, okay?

[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.940]
So they obviously are really in tune with what this show is all about,

[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:41.900]
but we thank them anyway.

[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.220]
Then I have a postcard from Austria.

[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:45.940]
Another fan.

[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:49.340]
Yeah, these are some of our loyals analysts who are stuck in Austria.

[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.060]
We miss your radio show terribly.

[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.380]
The radio shows here consist of yodeling.

[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.580]
And endless Kurt Waldheim speeches.

[00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:58.260]
Wow.

[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.840]
Even Stan Major would sound good to us now.

[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.440]
Yeah.

[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.860]
What a statement.

[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.400]
Now that is a strong statement.

[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.440]
And at the very end, it says,

[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.920]
PS, give the bird a peck on the cheek for us.

[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.160]
Well, I think I'll pass on that.

[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.060]
We'll pass along your best regards, okay?

[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.860]
Then we have, look at this, talk about propaganda,

[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.500]
or somebody I know would say propaganda.

[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.200]
Remember those days?

[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.260]
Anyway, the Rubatourism Authority has sent me just...

[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:23.680]
Oh.

[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.440]
Just rings of stuff.

[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:26.120]
Great.

[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.020]
About a Rubum.

[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.380]
Maybe you'd like to take a look at that for your next trip there.

[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.360]
Soon.

[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.580]
And it's 617 on Zaynipore.

[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.240]
You know, I had such a peaceful quiet week.

[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.240]
Oh, week was incredible.

[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:37.600]
I bet.

[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.680]
And just in the last 15 hours,

[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.380]
I've been such trauma in my house.

[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:42.860]
It's incredible.

[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.780]
Anyway, then somebody sends...

[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.540]
Somebody sends Captain Dave.

[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.480]
And the guy's name is Dave R.E.I.D.E.R.

[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.900]
So he says to us this morning,

[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.360]
Oh, look at Dave Ryder's, Sennisson.

[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.900]
Now, the guy's name is Ryder,

[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.900]
but it's not the same Dave Ryder's you hear on those

[00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.700]
in Sippet recordings for the weather, okay?

[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.120]
Or that makes all those money?

[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.180]
That's what I'm talking about.

[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.080]
9776 numbers.

[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.520]
But anyway, this guy,

[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:05.860]
and I hear this guy with a sense of humor,

[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.560]
he wants Captain Dave to rate all of these different

[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.560]
radio and TV personalities.

[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.560]
He's got just millions of them listed on here.

[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.940]
And he wants them rated on a scale of 1 to 10,

[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.040]
not just in one category, mind you.

[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:22.940]
Personality, speech, delivery, knowledge, and professionalism.

[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.000]
Such big names is Clarence Lot and W.I.D.E.R.

[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:27.540]
Professionalism.

[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.040]
Joe Brennan and W.S. News.

[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.040]
Sonny Hirshon, W.I.O.D.

[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.640]
As Anna squeak on there.

[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.320]
Anna, ask you, we as somebody

[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.740]
and no causaries on here, yeah?

[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:39.640]
And the Naomi Wright.

[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:40.900]
Naomi Wright.

[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.020]
Jim Frank.

[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:43.840]
Bill McQuig.

[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.760]
Peppy Fields.

[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.400]
Robbie Young.

[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:48.340]
Tody Fields.

[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.840]
This guy does.

[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.400]
This guy does.

[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:51.240]
He has a sense of humor.

[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.500]
So anyway, this guy's, so we got some pretty interesting

[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.020]
male considering, yeah, considering it's probably from

[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.760]
a week ago, but that's the way we get our male here.

[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.320]
It's 619 on Zeta 4 and I'll be damn.

[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.600]
We got a little something to do here.

[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:03.420]
I'll be damn.

[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.480]
A couple of calls on there.

[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.380]
I shouldn't give the numbers out.

[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.360]
I shouldn't, I just in case.

[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.480]
620, 3600 in Dade.

[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.040]
And 779, 3600 in Broward.

[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:12.920]
Now today is a holiday.

[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.660]
So if you're one of those people that doesn't like to

[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.540]
wait a long time and gets really frustrated because

[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.720]
during the week in the past, you know, a lot of times

[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.380]
you can't get through.

[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.640]
I guarantee you there'll be no problem at all today.

[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.560]
Okay, because it's a holiday and it's a wonderful time to call.

[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.940]
And we've been telling you how thrilled I am with my new mobile phone

[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.560]
that I got from the fine folks at ABC Cellular.

[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.400]
Well, Florida's number one mobile phone company is going to

[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:38.320]
get you mobile this week with their incredible two for one sale.

[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.760]
I've never heard anything like this in terms of car phones.

[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.440]
The NAC 4500ES is a great all around car phone with

[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.220]
hands-free operation so you can talk and drive at the same time.

[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:51.360]
It's kind of like walking in trinig on at the same time.

[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.700]
So listen to this, you buy the NAC from our friends at ABC Cellular

[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.580]
and you'll get one free only from ABC.

[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.480]
No money, no payments for six months and that's not all.

[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.700]
When every purchase you'll get dinner for two at Tony Romas.

[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.820]
So give ABC a call today.

[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.300]
They really have the best mobile phones you can buy and they make sure

[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.080]
that you're satisfied.

[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:13.840]
The number to call in both day, brown, pombi, forever is 621-6000.

[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.640]
ABC authorized agents for Cellular One.

[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.960]
Whatever you do, take advantage of this incredible two for one offer this week from ABC.

[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.480]
Call 621-6000.

[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:23.400]
Okay?

[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:24.300]
Okay.

[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:25.280]
All right.

[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.640]
Now I have a little bit of news here, but I think I better save it just in case

[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.360]
with a real newscast.

[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.080]
Oh, in other words, you don't want to tip your hand?

[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.420]
No, I just may not.

[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.520]
If I do it now, I'm having a need to do.

[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.940]
Yeah, so I would rather.

[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:43.640]
I'll just say that I saw a billboard yesterday that says the lottery is up to 20 million.

[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.960]
Which means nobody wanted and that's what they're going to draw for this coming Saturday.

[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.520]
And we have some positive words too.

[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.320]
That's pretty good news.

[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.220]
Somebody did one.

[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.180]
We've had about three calls saying that seven people said.

[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.100]
Well, then why did they say?

[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.880]
Well, there was just in case they were getting ready.

[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.640]
It's like billboards out there with Joey's picture on them.

[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.340]
Oh, I see.

[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.880]
Just in case he's stuck around.

[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.800]
But obviously that isn't going to happen.

[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.360]
And a lottery isn't going to be worth 20 million.

[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:05.580]
I see.

[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.300]
Someone won the 14 million or whatever.

[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.200]
Ever in a West Coast.

[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.960]
Yeah, from the West Coast again.

[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:10.680]
That's usual.

[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.160]
Well, then that says new.

[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.300]
Probably one of Bob Martinez's buddies over there from the West Coast.

[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.000]
Probably somebody from E-Borr City, right, Governor Bob?

[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:18.860]
No speaking in English.

[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.020]
Who the hell are you kidding, pal?

[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:21.600]
Okay.

[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:22.180]
All right.

[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.220]
Well, they know how to do it or what.

[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.160]
They know how to screw everything up.

[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.280]
They can mess up the Pope.

[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.340]
This was a news guest.

[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.740]
I didn't know someone won the whole thing.

[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:30.700]
And we just learned something.

[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.580]
Isn't it nice when we do a newscast when we learn from the audience?

[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.260]
I like that.

[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.780]
621 on Zeta 4.

[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:41.400]
It's the Neil Rogers show on Zeta 4.

[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.780]
Okay, 623 on this Memorial Day morning.

[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:44.720]
And what can I say?

[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.160]
We actually have a bunch of calls on the phone, which is frightening.

[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.320]
And one has to really wonder why, right?

[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.520]
North Miami Beach.

[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:50.840]
Hello.

[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:51.820]
Hey, how's it going?

[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:52.420]
Pretty good.

[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:53.620]
How are you doing, Neil?

[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:54.900]
What are you doing up at this hour?

[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:55.800]
I'm working.

[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.860]
I've been up for this midnight.

[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:57.620]
Really?

[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.180]
You and what?

[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.260]
I work over at people's gas systems on the gas control order.

[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.500]
Oh, you're the gas man.

[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.940]
Yeah, I'm the gas man.

[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:05.760]
Yes, it's about the gas.

[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.580]
Well, we've got a whole bunch of gas.

[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.380]
I was going to ask you about that.

[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:08.500]
Yeah.

[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.220]
About that lottery winning.

[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.580]
I did hear something about it on TV.

[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.480]
But I didn't know that's the way it went.

[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.200]
You know, I saw.

[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.600]
For there is $20 million to look for gas, huh?

[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.060]
No.

[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:20.760]
No?

[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.240]
No, somebody, see, that's what the billboard said.

[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.760]
But that would only be if nobody wanted it, it would be up to 20.

[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:26.340]
Oh, really?

[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.820]
So some jerk over there on the West Coast won the $14 million, I guess.

[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.660]
So now it goes back to $0.

[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:32.900]
Is that something?

[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.480]
Yeah, so I don't know how much it'll be.

[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.100]
I guess it's guaranteed for a million, right?

[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.240]
That's where it starts.

[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.300]
Yeah, I think so.

[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:40.700]
So it'll be, not even worth playing for a million, right?

[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.040]
Yeah.

[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.740]
When he odds there about $10 million to one against it, I mean,

[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:44.760]
you got to be out of your mind.

[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.840]
You got to wait till it gets up to about $2 or $3 billion.

[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.300]
Yeah, you know, I really don't play that thing.

[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.960]
It's just like you were saying, you know, the chances of winning one of those things was like...

[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.200]
Let me tell you, let me give you a parallel, okay?

[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.720]
You know, today is Memorial Day and a lot of people are going to be barbecuing if the weather clears up.

[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:01.080]
Really?

[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:06.120]
Okay, you could use that money that you would spend to buy the lottery tickets instead of charcoal, okay?

[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.980]
And accomplish the same thing, because you might as well burn it.

[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:10.440]
That's true.

[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.620]
So I don't know, you know, it was kind of like, when you guys were talking about a little while ago,

[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:20.280]
and I said to myself, yeah, I heard all of them use just last night when I was there.

[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.200]
I was just walking the rerun of the honest queen who was saying that to me.

[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.700]
Oh, then you hit the... maybe we misunderstood.

[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:27.360]
Yeah.

[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:32.820]
Yeah, we better double check it, because when Anna asks, week is on air, man, you need 16 interpreters just to be sure.

[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.740]
Okay, we'll check it out for you.

[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.400]
See if we can find somebody speaks English, okay?

[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.000]
Take a walk now.

[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:37.980]
Okay, have a good one.

[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:38.380]
Bye-bye.

[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:38.920]
Bye-bye.

[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:46.760]
Well, I can't believe these bright, articulate, intelligent, rational, semi-human people that are up in this hour on a Memorial Day holiday Monday, whatever it is.

[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:47.240]
Can you?

[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.300]
No, I can't.

[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.540]
This place looks unbelievable.

[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.280]
What a rubah.

[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.560]
Yeah, let's check this out.

[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.560]
Look, there's hardly anyone at the beach just...

[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.600]
I like it real quiet, peaceful.

[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:57.960]
It's all over that thing.

[00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.740]
The particular couple, if that's what is in a rubah, I'll pass, okay.

[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.140]
That's not my cup of tea.

[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.380]
But anyway, yeah, I've had mixed reviews.

[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.840]
No, don't forget, that's from the promotion, that's from the chamber people who are promoting it.

[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.060]
Oh, they wouldn't lie to us, wouldn't they?

[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:09.520]
No, they're not.

[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.080]
Just like in the Bahamas, you know, when they tell you how wonderful the engine feel it is.

[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.200]
Now, why don't you go with me to Cosmell in a few weeks?

[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.280]
Have a wonderful time, okay.

[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.200]
Are you really going to Cosmell?

[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.060]
They asked me if I wanted to go.

[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.280]
Oh boy, and you know how much eating he does, don't you?

[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.860]
Well, better get some kale pectade like a couple of cases for when he comes back.

[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.700]
Well, he's going to be doing a green apple quick step for months when he comes back from Mexico, isn't he?

[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.200]
Well, you can bring your own water.

[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:39.220]
I got my little stash of water starting my avion back there, and I'm taking it home today, by the way.

[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.840]
You're taking a lot of stuff home.

[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.720]
Well, I might as well make him carry something when we get on it.

[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.780]
You're going to get any food today?

[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:46.280]
No.

[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.960]
On this holiday, it'll be pretty bizarre, wouldn't it?

[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:56.360]
I mean, we have to really have an incredibly loyal audience for food to show up today, like maybe even fat rich driving up here with something that he would have.

[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:57.240]
I'm pretty hungry.

[00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:03.100]
Yeah, well, that's why I'm begging because, you know, to get him to come in here this hour, the morning was a gargantuan task.

[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:06.620]
He was begging and pleading to come in and speak to his public.

[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.480]
Well, he hasn't been here in a very long time.

[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.800]
We got some peppers.

[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.720]
What were you going to say not long enough is that I just saw the words from him.

[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:16.900]
On the birds lips there, not long enough, I think, was the, he's alright.

[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.420]
Oh, a little hospital this morning.

[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.060]
I know to say 26 past.

[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.140]
I thought we'd become friends, obviously, has to ride.

[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.660]
Now, what did I say?

[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:32.440]
You just look like you're, like you're experiencing a little consternation this morning, but that's because you have no paper.

[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:33.960]
It's not about Dave, yeah.

[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:34.480]
Okay.

[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.220]
It's not about, I have no news.

[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:36.800]
What is it, Lane?

[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:37.880]
Let's talk about it.

[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.180]
I don't have a newspaper.

[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.680]
I don't know what's going on.

[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:40.680]

[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.840]
I feel we should discuss this.

[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.620]
Oh, cheers.

[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:44.700]
This is good.

[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:48.180]
I like this when you two start, what do you call this?

[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:48.440]
What do you call this?

[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.620]
Like the biggersons?

[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.260]
Are we, are we the biggersons?

[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.300]
Yeah, something like that.

[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.680]
And then I wanted to ask you a question.

[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.260]
Is David Letterman live now?

[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.920]
No, they're still, they're still in reruns, but they're talking about coming back.

[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.320]
I think next Monday, they'll start them live again.

[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.300]
I better take some more calls because these people are hanging up on me.

[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.360]
I might need to be, chill out.

[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.540]
Hey, it's all on Neil.

[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:09.020]
Okay.

[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.320]
That's a big day than in the bird.

[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.420]
And a little day, yeah.

[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:12.920]
Yeah.

[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.100]
We're so keen.

[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.540]
Yeah, go, Cain's.

[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.740]
Now, how do you like that assortment of teams that they played in the...

[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.160]
Okay, let me tell you, the team is from Houston.

[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:21.740]
Houston?

[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.380]
Yeah, right outside Baltimore.

[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.560]
Oh, yeah, sure.

[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.100]
A few thousand students.

[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:26.820]
What do they do?

[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.800]
Find them hanging out outside Pimlicore or something?

[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.040]
ODAVs?

[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:30.720]
No.

[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:31.920]
Billy Hunter.

[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:32.720]
Billy Hunter.

[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:33.440]
Well, I'll be damned.

[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:34.000]
That's great.

[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.780]
I'll be sure to detect the B-top counterliners.

[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.100]
Yep.

[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.120]
And of course that James Madison, that's your halva.

[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.840]
You know, I wish they'd start playing some schools with guys all, though.

[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:46.780]
You know, these girls schools, it gets a little embarrassing, but Ron's got a great sense of humor.

[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.820]
He knows how to get to Omaha.

[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.060]
Why would this one the first time you see it?

[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:50.520]
What?

[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.600]
Well, it was also gone.

[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.600]
Well, good for them.

[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:54.780]
Oh, they beat...

[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:56.500]
Stetson.

[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.320]
Stetson.

[00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:58.580]
Yeah, that's another one of my favorites.

[00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.120]
Oh, look at that.

[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.180]
The team with the funny hats, yeah.

[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.420]
Okay, well, listen, go kids, right?

[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:04.660]
Whatever you say.

[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:05.580]
Okay, have a good day.

[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.280]
Please, don't ever, ever call us early in the morning.

[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:13.280]
20 and after six, 6 to all, 3600 in the day, 7779, 3600 and brown.

[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:15.600]
Boy, great.

[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.380]
Kill it, honey.

[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.460]
What a fight, there!

[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:18.940]
At worst, delivered.

[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:23.060]
We know the kid is surviving household accidents is early warning.

[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.680]
Yeah, boy, I just love them, beans.

[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.200]
Oh, no!

[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.680]
Come on, kids.

[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.860]
Help them up these winners!

[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.720]
Well, I don't look like it.

[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.020]
It was a dog that done it.

[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.680]
When the worst happens, worst alert is there,

[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:41.160]
constantly sniffing the air for those silent but deadly personal fumes.

[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.720]
It's the worst alert, personal fume detected.

[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.380]
Put one in your office.

[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.840]
Smellers, I need this 200 page report in one hour.

[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:50.760]
What?

[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.820]
And open the window.

[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.780]
Put one in your car, too.

[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.000]
Hey, thank you for reading that burrito to go, man.

[00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.500]
Hey, thank you.

[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.040]
Get automatically lower as your window.

[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.260]
Man, close your window.

[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:09.100]
The worst alert, personal fume detected.

[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.100]
Available now with gas, modern, old, cheese, waste, old.

[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.840]
Near, we see up in the morning.

[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.320]
Near, we see up in the night.

[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.120]
Something's not a good day.

[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.460]
That DJ was, he the best or what, huh?

[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:39.260]
630 on Zeta 4 and thank God he's not in there,

[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.820]
so he's not going to make me play the rest of that.

[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.360]
I can't stand when he does that.

[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.420]
That sounds pretty good, actually.

[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:44.600]
Yeah, it does. It's great.

[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.440]
And he's going to do some more for us, too.

[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.500]
That's DJ's saying.

[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.040]
That's DJ in his group, yeah.

[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:49.740]
Wow.

[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:50.420]
Good, huh?

[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:50.780]
Yeah.

[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.140]
And he said he's going to do like a whole jingle package for us.

[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.160]
No matter how much we insult him, he still,

[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.540]
he loves the fact that we play that.

[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:57.660]
Oh, I'm sure.

[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.340]
And I don't know why he's amazed that we play it,

[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.180]
because it sounds great.

[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.380]
Everybody loves it.

[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.500]
They even played it on Channel 7 on the Slimet Fine.

[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.080]
That's right.

[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:06.920]
So they must have loved it.

[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.680]
Does he have any real songs that he's got?

[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:09.860]
Tape soof.

[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:10.380]
I don't know.

[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.440]
Probably trying to encourage him now, is that it?

[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.160]
Probably just I'd like to hear some more of this.

[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:15.160]

[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.200]
Yeah, the real music.

[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.800]
Maybe you'd like to invite him to come over the house with his group,

[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.560]
and he could jam all day.

[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.760]
No, I could throw a party.

[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.020]
You could sleep at the station.

[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.420]
No, I could, yeah, that's, I would trust me.

[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.020]
That would be a sure way to keep me out of the house,

[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.100]
is to invite to DJ, and go to his group.

[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.540]
Okay, those day lines are really flash and frantically,

[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.020]
and if you believe that, 620, 3600 and Dave,

[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.580]
like I said, we got a lot of stuff to play,

[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.020]
and we really don't care.

[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.380]
And something that dawned on me over the weekend,

[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.480]
I have no idea why I didn't suggest it on Friday,

[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.080]
but it's never too late to suggest.

[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.920]
And that is that a lot of you, pan and ES people,

[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.280]
that like to make requests, even when we don't take them,

[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.640]
that make these suggestions, and pretend not to be making requests.

[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.120]
Why not get the cassette recorder out now?

[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.580]
Get some blank tape, and record a lot of this stuff,

[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.020]
because we're gonna play a lot of the stuff that many of you

[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:01.480]
have never even heard from last year.

[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:02.400]
It's a good night.

[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.400]
Like, seriously, like the Tammy Fae thing,

[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.180]
and Ross did you, and all of that old stuff.

[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.440]
You mean get a cassette and record them?

[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.340]
Yeah, instead of asking us to do that,

[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.720]
actually putting the cassette in the machine,

[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.180]
and hooking the radio up in there somehow,

[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.180]
or even just putting it in front of the speaker,

[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.380]
with the sound that good, but whichever way you want to do it,

[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.900]
and recording off the air.

[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:28.080]
Yeah, most of the machines, I think, record radio off the air.

[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:28.740]
Right off the air, yeah, well, of course,

[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.280]
it's pretty simple to do that, but I mean,

[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.020]
people that don't have one of those kind, most of them do.

[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.800]
Yeah, most people do that.

[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.220]
Well, that's pretty unorthodox.

[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.560]
Yeah, and it does eliminate a lot of work for us

[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.580]
where they can't stand.

[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.080]
But just give it some thought, okay?

[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.900]
I wanna pressure you or anything, but it's something to think about.

[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.540]
There's something to think about, then you'll have a whole collection of this stuff

[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:50.380]
to, you know, whittle away your idle time,

[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.180]
all some of it when it's raining, can'ts, and dogs out.

[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.580]
You can't do anything in this Godforsaken place, okay?

[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.940]
Isn't it amazing how, unless, in a year, I had forgotten how awful it is,

[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:03.300]
see when it up north, when it rains, and it's dank, and it's gray all day,

[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:06.500]
it doesn't make any difference, because you're still up north, okay?

[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.160]
And there's still all of those other things going on that don't happen here.

[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:14.380]
But when it happens here like that, when it's raining and gray and dank all day,

[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.520]
then you really want to blow your brains out.

[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.880]
You do, I don't know.

[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:18.360]
I like it.

[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:19.440]
You realize where you are.

[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.180]
What is it that you're looking for?

[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.800]
It's an astray.

[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:23.580]
An astray?

[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:29.800]
Well, you think we can accommodate him with an astray, because you know how anti-smoking the boss is?

[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.820]
And this little tiny studio Dave.

[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:36.240]
Oh, I know, Gleng, it's not the best.

[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.020]
No, he doesn't care.

[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:38.660]
Here, here, here.

[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.340]
Use this cup.

[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.160]
Anyway, it's 6.33, just blow it all over against the wall there, okay?

[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.340]
So it is never something to bitch about.

[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:46.660]
We are pretty oblivious.

[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.840]
Hey, let's take a call from Pomano this morning.

[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.220]
Hello.

[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.780]
Hello, Neil. How are you doing?

[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:51.200]
Okay.

[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.160]
This is the X-Ruch Astaria, who called you last.

[00:40:54.240 --> 00:41:00.700]
Oh, by the way, listen, I'm so glad you mentioned it because I want to thank Frank in the Larry or Frankenstein or whoever was it,

[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.060]
said the White Hots in a hot sauce.

[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.580]
They are incredible.

[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.760]
Even Big Dave over here has become a White Hots of Hallock.

[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.040]
He just go nuts and they are the best.

[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.520]
There's Wiggles White Hots.

[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.660]
They sure are.

[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.700]
Neil, I am taping the show today.

[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.340]
I was wondering, is there any chance you'll be playing young Neil today?

[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.260]
I've heard that's an incredible thing you have.

[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:22.480]
You've never heard it?

[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.600]
He heard it's an incredible thing.

[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.320]
I have all I got to do is to...

[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.460]
I don't know who's been looking, but trust me.

[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.300]
Okay, I'm going to play it in just a second, so keep your tape rolling.

[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.280]
It is rolling.

[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:33.540]
We'll even do a request today.

[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.500]
Okay, that's how anxious we are to get this show over with, all right?

[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:37.360]
All right, Neil.

[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:37.880]
Okay.

[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.780]
Good luck to have a great life, sir.

[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:40.360]
I'll try.

[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.500]
Okay, 634 on Zeta4.

[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.700]
And now wait a minute, this is a long thing, though.

[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.240]
So we better do the break first, right?

[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.560]
This is three and a half minutes.

[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:48.640]
Oh my God.

[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.520]
So we better do the break first, Captain Dave.

[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:51.560]
It's 634.

[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.380]
I'm saying...

[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.340]
We'll come back right after these very important massages.

[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.680]
It's a 636, some lucky stiff over in Port Charlotte of all places.

[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:06.440]
Some Yeehaw, some Redneck, some Backwoods douchebag,

[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.620]
$1,000,000,000 in Florida Lottery, you know?

[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.820]
It's either going to be another Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn.

[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.900]
One of those Phantom people, you know?

[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.260]
One of those Mark Twain characters keeps winning it every week.

[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.300]
Don't you begin to wonder where the money's really going?

[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.100]
In the Injo.

[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:24.700]
Yeah, somebody like that.

[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.400]
So anyway, a good luck to all you suckers again.

[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:30.860]
And like I said, if you got money throw away, instead of wasting it on a Lottery,

[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:33.900]
because none of you won it this week and you're never going to win it,

[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.140]
just send us the money, okay?

[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.680]
Just put it in the big brown bag.

[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.720]
Now is this Dave Ryder here on the front of a business money,

[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.140]
Ryder's driving force?

[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.180]
Yeah, sure looks like it.

[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.100]
He's a heavy hitter.

[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:43.160]
A heavy hitter.

[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.100]
Toughest nails and a nice guy.

[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.440]
Now that's Dave Ryder, isn't he?

[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:49.820]
Yeah, and we wish he'd get in one of those trucks and head on out of town real quick.

[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.780]
About those snacks of money that he refuses to bring to us, okay?

[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.900]
You know, when your friends make it big and they won't bring you bags of money,

[00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:00.420]
then, oh, and you know what else I watched a little bit of last night?

[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:05.700]
And I tell you, he looked really good last night was Johnny Depp on the first street.

[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.960]
He looked like all clean cut and clean shave.

[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:08.860]
Yeah, sure it is.

[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:12.360]
Unlike the day he was here, kind of, well, he looked pretty good here,

[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.160]
but he was a little disheveled and unshaven and messed up.

[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.580]
And they really cleaned him up last night, boy.

[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:19.020]
He looked almost antiseptic.

[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.140]
However, the question I've got,

[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.040]
if you want to be on that show, 21 Jump Street,

[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.260]
how heavy does the earring have to be in your...

[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.100]
I'm serious Dave.

[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.800]
They all have to have a chain like down to your puppet with a big cross on the bottom.

[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:31.480]
One of those.

[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:35.720]
And, you know, I just wonder how heavy it has to be to qualify to be on the show.

[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.920]
So it's 637 on Zeta 4, and look at that now.

[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.380]
We said we'd even take requests,

[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.240]
and they aren't exactly fooling you from us.

[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.360]
So what does that tell you?

[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:50.380]
That we're broadcasting to a very limited group until probably about 8 o'clock,

[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.360]
830 dollars start crawling out of the sack.

[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:57.740]
Now, back to the Neil Rogers program on Clone Porting, WGVA.

[00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:59.260]
And you know what would be even better?

[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.920]
Yeah, that's not going to work out.

[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.160]
I got that's a mono card.

[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.300]
She sure knows that?

[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:05.880]
That's right.

[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:06.780]
That's a mono card.

[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.840]
So the guy who's taping right now is all excited.

[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.160]
Oh, boy.

[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.480]
That's a nice feedback though that he got on his tape.

[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.280]
That was real nice.

[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.260]
So that's only going to have to wait just a second.

[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.080]
So you want to fill its 22.7 on Zeta 4.

[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.940]
We got the radio highlights.

[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:21.820]
Oh, that's good.

[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:22.920]
Now, let's see, it's Monday.

[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:24.000]
It is a holiday.

[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.460]
830 this morning on WQBA.

[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:27.240]
Oh, it does.

[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:28.080]
It's not in here.

[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.260]
No macho, Kamacho.

[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.640]
Yeah, they didn't put that in here.

[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.600]
No drugs on WQBA this morning.

[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:36.200]
Bob Coons is on the Paul Lyle show.

[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.120]
Oh, gee.

[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.140]
Just what we needed on the holiday, okay?

[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.120]
Oh, God.

[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.100]
Give us a, can we get a holiday from him?

[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:46.060]
What is he ever going to get a real job?

[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.840]
Yeah, that is a good, that fact that's the trivia question of the day.

[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.560]
What is Bob Coons going to get a job?

[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:53.700]
I think that's a very, and what is he going to stop peddling bumper stickers

[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.160]
and exploiting people's misery?

[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.600]
That's a good question.

[00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:00.740]
So that's a real, more like a bumper sticker on my cards is curable now.

[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:04.440]
Steve Kane show it to PMWIOD topic.

[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:06.640]
Debate on the middle effect.

[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.280]
Debate on the steep bean show.

[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.180]
That's incredible.

[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.240]
The mental effect of abortion on women.

[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:13.200]
Uh-huh.

[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.080]
Mm-hmm.

[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:15.600]
Okay.

[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:19.340]
How about a debate on the mental effect of programs on abortion on the audience?

[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:23.320]
I mean, is this guy for real or what?

[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.760]
He's got like four topics.

[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:28.500]
He's got Michael DeSisto abortion, which he's obsessed with.

[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:30.360]
And are there two others?

[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:31.440]
I think they slipped my mind.

[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:33.740]
Well, I think he lets Bob Coons on there now and again.

[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:34.040]

[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.260]
Well, maybe Bob will stick around.

[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:35.820]
Yeah.

[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:36.340]
Okay.

[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:37.300]
Great idea.

[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.020]
20-07 on Zeta Ford.

[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:44.340]
Now, back to the Neil Rogers program on 1240 WGBA.

[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:50.120]
Here again, America's youngest talk show host, six-year-old Neil Rogers.

[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:52.940]
Okay.

[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.700]
I guess we're done with Neil.

[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:58.120]
And there's four minutes left in the hour.

[00:45:58.540 --> 00:45:59.740]
Let's take some calls.

[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:00.560]
All in.

[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:01.240]
Hello.

[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.100]
And Neil, how's it going?

[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:04.160]
Great.

[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:05.640]
That's good.

[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:10.580]
Well, so I can't film my subscriptions at a Rochester Democrat in Chronicle.

[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.120]
Uh, the good old DNC.

[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:15.800]
What an abortion death paper is.

[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.740]
Then I asked how many other people did likewise.

[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.800]
And they said, now I'm my business.

[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.640]
Yeah, well, they're real nice over there.

[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:24.660]
Okay.

[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.420]
Well, I just spotted it.

[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:26.960]
Let's you know.

[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.540]
You're a fine American.

[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:29.900]
Have a nice life.

[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:30.440]
Hello.

[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:31.280]

[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.800]
I want to speak to Neil.

[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.560]
You got him.

[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:35.660]
Am I on?

[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:36.760]
Yeah.

[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:38.140]
Neil.

[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:39.420]
Yeah.

[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.860]
Neil, you're a stinky pink old glue sniffing.

[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.460]
Bedwater at a pansy.

[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:47.000]
Great call.

[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.020]
This is day so far.

[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.540]
Did he say pansy?

[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.060]
Where does he get off?

[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:53.660]
What a mong brain.

[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.520]
I want my bike.

[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:58.840]
30 miles every Saturday to do this show.

[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.140]
And this guy calls me named.

[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.540]
She's on you, sir.

[00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.100]
She's on you.

[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:10.120]
By the way, have you seen some of those bad boys at the new rampy?

[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.780]
No, what are you cackling about?

[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:16.360]
Hey.

[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.940]
This is my son.

[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:23.060]
A million producers in the world.

[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.900]
And they stick me in here with an A.

[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.080]
Shut this mic off.

[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.260]
It's in the castle.

[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:34.120]
Hello.

[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:35.400]
Hello, Neil.

[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.660]
You're supposed to be in such a nice boy.

[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:40.620]
I'm now your sub-town.

[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.180]
Yeah, but you can't shut it off.

[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.820]
You can't shut it off.

[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:48.060]
I need this.

[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.400]
I'm offered from other stations.

[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:56.720]
Patavia, Almira, Fredonia.

[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:04.560]
But instead, I stay here and entertain you grotesque sub-human dutabag.

[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:06.500]
Unbelievable.

[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:08.980]
Geneva, hello.

[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.060]
Hello, is this Neil Rogers?

[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.440]
What kind of phone are you on, sir?

[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.040]
How's that again?

[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.740]
Do you have a dial phone or a watt?

[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.520]
No, I had to put it to the operator.

[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:24.680]
Let's...

[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:26.680]
Let's...

[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:27.600]
Let's not get into that.

[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:32.000]
Hey, I was listening to Joey Reynolds on WKBW last night.

[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.300]
Somebody asked you.

[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:35.780]
Did you hear what he's been saying about you?

[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.560]
No, I don't listen anymore.

[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:39.720]
He's a daughtering old man.

[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:41.940]
He claims he's only 40.

[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:43.000]
Yeah, right.

[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.420]
Do we be true and true?

[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:48.940]
Oh, shut up.

[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:49.940]
And you're pathetic.

[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.640]
And if you think he's bad now, we totally had you.

[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:56.520]
Oh, boy.

[00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:01.780]
Okay, when we come back, maybe the egg will come out of his shell.

[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.740]
But I hope not.

[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:11.460]
I see there was a time that I wouldn't play that a lot anymore because it was too long.

[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:12.560]
Not today.

[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:14.260]
Oh, that was good.

[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:15.300]
I like that a lot.

[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.800]
We might play that again before today.

[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:18.820]
Just in case your recorder is one-rolling.

[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:19.180]
Okay?

[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:23.060]
17-07 on Zeta 4, 6-0, 3600 in date.

[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:25.640]
And 7-7-9, 3600 in brow.

[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:29.180]
And this is kind of like a little holiday gift in the audience, digging out a lot of this old material.

[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.180]
And bringing it back.

[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.540]
Here's another amp, by the way.

[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.360]
And like we've told you, it's always a picnic when you work for Guy Gannon Broadcasting.

[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.660]
Every day is a picnic and that's why this place is loaded with ants, okay?

[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:39.440]
Right.

[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:43.660]
Even though your picnic may get rained out today, we always have a picnic here at Zeta.

[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:45.440]
It looks dank outside, doesn't it?

[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:50.640]
It looks dank and very grey and depressing and morbid and happy holidays to you.

[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.840]
See, I like it when it's like...

[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:53.080]
Why?

[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:54.700]
Because...

[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:59.220]
Why the hell don't you move to Ohio or somewhere if you like it like this or to Buffalo?

[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:02.400]
We don't have it that often like this, I don't think.

[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:03.900]
So count your lucky star.

[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:06.180]
Why would anybody want it like this on a holiday?

[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.240]
Oh well, the...

[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.900]
The house is a matter to you, but how about all these wonderful people out there?

[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:13.040]
Go to the movies.

[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:14.240]
Sorry.

[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.260]
What a spoils for you.

[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:17.700]
I know.

[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:18.880]
I know.

[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:20.820]
What's the term I'm looking for?

[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:24.000]
Somebody goes to the party and just ruins it for everybody.

[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:25.040]
Oh come on.

[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:27.600]
I don't want to ruin anything for anyone.

[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:28.860]
You know you want them to...

[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:29.720]
No, no, no.

[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.000]
No, no.

[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.720]
When it's like this, I enjoy it, but I don't...

[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.340]
You enjoy it?

[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.540]
I don't want it to be this way necessarily.

[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:38.600]
But when it does get like this, I enjoy it.

[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.940]
But no, I don't want to ruin anybody's anything.

[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:42.540]
It's sunny and hot, great.

[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.560]
You know that's fine too. Do you understand?

[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.900]
Okay, honor away to Canon Daegwa and wants to know what I want.

[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:52.220]
Well boy, anybody that's honor away to Canon Daegwa is in big trouble.

[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.040]
Why am I in big trouble?

[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.740]
Because it's probably still snowing there.

[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:59.100]
No, it's not. In fact, my mom said it's even hot.

[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:00.240]
It's in the 70s.

[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:02.260]
Yeah, it's probably nicer there right now than it is here.

[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.100]
I told her to sit down and shut up.

[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.680]
I'm going the end of the month.

[00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.460]
So I think you're by then you'll be ready for another white hot fix.

[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.500]
You told your mother to sit down and shut up?

[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:14.340]
When she told me it was hot, it was like I said.

[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:14.440]

[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.140]
I'd degrees here.

[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:16.920]
I've got all my air conditioners running.

[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:17.320]
Yeah.

[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.500]
Sweating and she says, oh, look out really hot today.

[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.120]
It was in the low 70s.

[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.020]
Yeah. I got you.

[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:26.140]
So I think you're by the end of the month.

[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:27.540]
You'll be ready for another white hot.

[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:31.980]
Oh yeah, in fact, these are going so fast now that by the end of my picnic today,

[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:32.820]
they'll all be gone.

[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:33.640]
Oh, they're great.

[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:34.200]
I love them.

[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:39.460]
In fact, well, my brothers lived in the Buffalo Rochester area for about the last 20 or 25 years.

[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:41.180]
My mom moved up a few years ago.

[00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:47.320]
And my sister, who has lived in South Florida for 30 some odd years, moved up last September.

[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:53.220]
They all lived in Canada, Gua, but my sister just bought 21 acres outside of Rochester.

[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:53.860]
Wow.

[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:54.740]
I can't wait.

[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.360]
That's great. Well, tell her to get a little plot there for me.

[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:58.040]
Yeah, right.

[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:02.140]
I mean, like one that you bury somebody and I mean one where you put a house on.

[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:06.780]
As the cost of property up there is like really low.

[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:07.240]
I know.

[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:08.780]
Yeah, I wonder why.

[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:10.580]
More than a depressed market.

[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:13.680]
And I'm really looking forward to going up there.

[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.020]
Okay. Well, listen, have a good time.

[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.580]
And if you can find a way to, I don't know how people do that.

[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.960]
Well, what you can do is get a cool like styrofoam cooler.

[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:22.280]
Yeah.

[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:25.580]
And what you do is freeze the hot dogs or whatever before you leave.

[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:27.720]
And put them in there with hot ice.

[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.160]
Yeah, or with hot ice.

[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.040]
Yeah, because it doesn't melt as fast as cold ice.

[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:32.660]
I got you.

[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:35.600]
Put it in with hot ice and then just put it in a box and seal it.

[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:35.860]
Great.

[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.720]
And bring it back as part of your luggage.

[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.140]
Okay, I'll be looking forward to it.

[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:39.800]
Well, I'll be right in here.

[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:43.900]
Well, no, this was quite as if I was about 18 years old and I went up there and visited.

[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:47.740]
And I loved to corn from up there and discovered something in the black dirt.

[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:49.760]
That's a food is so good.

[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:51.220]
So I bought a satelle back.

[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.780]
One side was all hot of white hearts and red hearts.

[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:55.460]
And the other side was corn.

[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:57.700]
And I let it.

[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.320]
Made it last.

[00:52:58.640 --> 00:52:59.380]
Yeah, well, that's good.

[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.700]
Okay, we'll be looking forward to it.

[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:01.120]
Okay.

[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:01.880]
Have a good one.

[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:02.540]
You too, bye bye.

[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:02.780]
Bye bye.

[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:03.600]
13-07.

[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.300]
Now you got over that.

[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:05.240]
You got over that.

[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.060]
I'll leave her a lot.

[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:07.080]
She's not like that.

[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:09.200]
I'll get her back if you want.

[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:10.220]
I'll invite her to call back.

[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:11.740]
We'll do an hour on upstate in New York.

[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:13.960]
Okay, I can't help it if they're not all from Lakeland.

[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:16.380]
They can't all be e-haw red necks.

[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:16.700]
All right.

[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:21.200]
Guy who watched Termin and McBean last.

[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.320]
What is it?

[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:23.740]
Night.

[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:24.920]
Oh, geez.

[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.440]
I don't know if we can put this on the air.

[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:26.760]
Hello.

[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.620]
Yeah, I've been waiting this is last night to fire that.

[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.700]
Would you guys think about that,

[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:32.000]
or have an McBean and what they did?

[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:32.640]
What about them?

[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.360]
There are a couple of the couple of wackos.

[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:34.780]
Okay.

[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:35.880]
There are a couple of sickos.

[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:39.200]
And anybody would go to a leukemia foundation fundraiser

[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.220]
and moon the audience.

[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:42.800]
What are people with other little kids there?

[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:45.880]
And the bear some broads boobs there in front of the audience.

[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:46.840]
Really needs help.

[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:47.720]
Okay, desperate.

[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:49.320]
Desperate.

[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.480]
Well, sick of meal.

[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:51.360]
Yeah, right.

[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:52.420]
Sick is the word.

[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:52.800]
Okay.

[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:53.600]
Well, who cares?

[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:54.640]
You know about herm and McQueen,

[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:55.660]
you're like small potatoes.

[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.560]
Like most of the other people who work for that company over there.

[00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:00.060]
And they're just desperate for attention.

[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:01.420]
Desperate.

[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:04.440]
Like they had to make a bombsled thing that we played a little bit of last week

[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.560]
and killed it in the middle because it was so boring.

[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:07.980]
Have you heard that?

[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:09.140]
I like that.

[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:10.880]
You played that?

[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.140]
We just shut his mic on.

[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:13.540]
Yeah, would you play it a little bit of it?

[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:14.060]
It's horrible.

[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:16.060]
We never really got to the point.

[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:16.940]
Everyone I know likes that.

[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:18.040]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:20.720]
We never really got to the punchline.

[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:20.800]
I know.

[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.220]
Why don't we play the whole thing right now?

[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.660]
No, I mean, we got about halfway through.

[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:26.300]
First of all, you can't get to the punchline.

[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.040]
It's boring.

[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:27.760]
That's what I mean.

[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.960]
It's like we played about over half of it and it was like, okay.

[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.640]
Yeah, we're waiting for something funny.

[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:33.480]
It's not funny.

[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.900]
And it just, you know, there wasn't too much to it.

[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:36.560]
I don't know everyone.

[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:36.920]
I know.

[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.480]
Well, yeah, but you travel in very bizarre circles.

[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.460]
Everybody knows that.

[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:43.240]
It's, that's an understatement.

[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:51.080]
Okay, now this is no Jamaican vobsline, but they can't ever read this.

[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:55.600]
George Bruce, his time is fast.

[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:59.900]
That we won't stop the Duke of the Fuzz.

[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:03.960]
Oh, I have big eyebrows.

[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:06.800]
I'll take them to the White House.

[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:10.500]
Whoa, whoa, and I.

[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:14.380]
I'm gonna be the big guy.

[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:18.340]
Oh, yes, I'm boring and I'm serious.

[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:23.540]
But I am the Duke of Mass.

[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.240]
My future sucks.

[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:27.940]
Oh, baby.

[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:31.400]
I have absolutely no charisma.

[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:34.080]
But I look like Casey K. S.

[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:37.480]
And maybe people will vote for me by accident.

[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:42.200]
Now can I have a Greek salad with fennel cheese free?

[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:48.880]
Cause I'm gonna be the big guy.

[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:53.400]
Oh, yes, I'm maybe barely five foot nine.

[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:57.080]
But I'm the Duke of Mass.

[00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:01.580]
Oh, my soul chooses to do.

[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:03.560]
Like you call this.

[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.480]
Duke of Mass.

[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.440]
Duke of Mass.

[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.420]
Like I said, it's no Jamaican vobsline, but you can't have everything.

[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:23.400]
And isn't it appropriate that as we work our way toward the end of this cut, the next one is the bed?

[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:24.180]
Yeah.

[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:25.800]
Perfect, right?

[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:27.460]
Incredible how that worked out.

[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:29.880]
Yeah, because it's newstime, right?

[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:33.220]
It's 10 to 7 and now we have the hair old so you can steal a bunch of stuff out of the paper.

[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:33.660]
Here we go.

[00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:35.100]
We use this as the bed of songs.

[00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:42.360]
Florida has its first lotto grand prize winner, but nobody has stepped forward to claim the $13 million jackpot yet.

[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:48.800]
Lado's spokesman Ed George said computer records show that a single ticket bearing the six winning numbers, which were

[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:53.760]
36, 12, 19, 13, 20, and 48.

[00:56:53.760 --> 00:57:01.140]
It was purchased last week in the port Charlotte area of southwestern Florida, which beats the 13.9 million to one odds.

[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:05.560]
There were 11.3 million tickets sold over the past week.

[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.940]
Now some big things happened in sports yesterday.

[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:15.080]
Rick Mears overcame a record 14 caution periods to win the Indianapolis 500.

[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:25.200]
Every speed of 144 miles per hour, Miami beats South Carolina, 10 to 3 to win the NCAA Atlantic Regional and they will go to the college Royal Series now.

[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.260]
You know the other teams in there are faster.

[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.100]
Toast in state, James Madison.

[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:32.420]
Charlie Davidson.

[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:44.040]
Derek Harper scored 35 points to lead the Dallas Mavericks to a 118104 victory over the LA Lakers, tying the NBA Western Conference finals at two games a piece.

[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.940]
That will be over this summer, right? They'll complete that.

[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:47.860]
Maybe. No, thanks.

[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:54.620]
Lou Panella fired last year as manager of the New York Yankees resigned as the club's general manager yesterday.

[00:57:55.100 --> 00:58:03.160]
And Martina Navaritolova was upset by a Soviet teenager in the French Open tennis championship.

[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:05.340]
It will be mostly cloudy today.

[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:12.820]
50% chance of showers and thunderstorms mid-80s today, mid-70s tonight.

[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:15.580]
Well, we don't understand. We're trying to brainwash the audience.

[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:18.920]
We're trying to indoctrinate them with this so they all make sure to go out and vote for the Duke.

[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:19.540]
Exactly.

[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:23.880]
All right, 72 degrees this morning on Zeta 652.

[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:29.700]
Move over Donna Hude. Oprah, get out of the way.

[00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:31.100]
Hit the road.

[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:32.280]
Hurrah, dog.

[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:36.500]
Tonight at 10 on 39 WDZL. Get ready.

[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:41.820]
The mighty mouth of TV talk shows is here. He's a father. He's a mother.

[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:43.320]
Oh, my.

[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.660]
He's Morton Downey Jr.

[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:52.280]
Listen, you Pavlam puking liberals. You'd like nothing better than to see the communist marching straight into Washington, DC.

[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:56.300]
And sending freedom, loving Americans, off to the goon lags inside Biria.

[00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:59.900]
Yeah, that's what you'd like, wouldn't you? Well, it's not going to happen.

[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:02.180]
Not as long as Morton Downey Jr. is here.

[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:09.660]
Tonight at 10 on 39 WDZL. Get a liberal dose of conservative opinions from Morton Downey Jr.

[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:14.200]
TV's most outrageous talk show, The Morton Downey Jr. Show.

[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:17.660]
Each and every week night at 10 on 39 WDZL.

[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:22.660]
Don't try to disguise your voice. I know who you are.

[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:29.380]
Hi, I'm your right foot. You got me jammed up against the gas pedal now, which is fine.

[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:34.000]
If I knew where we're going somewhere good, like somewhere to eat, like Barbrekfast, huh?

[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:37.460]
Like Burger King. You know, I don't like to bring this up.

[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:41.000]
But I do a lot for you walking here, walking there. Hey, that's okay.

[00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:43.440]
All right, but sometimes I have needs too.

[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:47.400]
For instance, I need one of those hot, Blakey Burger King Cressan,

[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:50.560]
which is, huh, stuffed with ham or bacon or sausage.

[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:53.780]
Who knows? Maybe even melted cheese. Is that too much to ask?

[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:59.320]
One Cressan, which for your right foot, you know, there's a drive through window at Burger King.

[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:01.580]
Makes things very fast. So let's make a deal.

[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:06.020]
You stop there this morning and I won't complain about your sock collection.

[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:09.780]
We still look like you. Do it at Burger King.

[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:14.320]
By a sandwich and a drink and get a Pepsi 6 pack to go for just $1.29

[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:19.580]
and participating in Broward County Burger King restaurants, Pepsi 6 pack $1.29, Broward Only.

[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:24.040]
One for customer, offer for a limited time. So hurry. Remember Broward Only.

[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.720]
Love me Tinder. Love me True.

[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.720]
Hello, baby. I bet you thought this was...

[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:39.420]
Yolvas. We'll be wrong. Because...

[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.400]
A Crapco is back.

[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.060]
With the Crapco School of Famous Impresions from Crapco.

[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:52.200]
Yes, here in Crapco, we've always believed that the key to success is being someone else.

[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:56.080]
Want to be a famous TV newscaster? Classes are in session right now. Look here.

[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:01.340]
Believe me. This is Walter Cronkite's CBS News.

[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:06.160]
Believe me. This is Walter Cronkite's CBS News.

[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.080]
Very good. Very good.

[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.820]
No, no, stop. No, no, stop. Wait.

[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.920]
Or how about our obnoxious comedians class?

[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:18.060]
Hi. How... Howdy. I don't know.

[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:23.260]
Hi. Howdy. I won't. But maybe Mr. T. Wood.

[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:26.680]
Peter DeFou don't enrol today. Get one for your dog too.

[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:31.100]
Sherlock Hurray. Yes. It's Crapco School of Famous Impresions.

[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.180]
And remember at Crapco, we always say...

[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:39.540]
If you buy this, you buy anything. And that's selling it like it is.

[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:45.280]
What sure is something bringing out these old mothball ridden things, isn't it?

[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.160]
It's something. I don't know what.

[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.700]
Federal Opera him it says from saying what?

[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.900]
655 on Zeta 4. It's a marvelous Monday.

[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:55.140]
Look at that. It's starting to get just a little bit less than.

[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.860]
It's pretty overcast. Just a little tiny teeny bit.

[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:03.220]
But speaking of Federal law, I wonder if we could get that story from Big Dave now.

[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:06.000]
Oh, you want to tell us about the figure row?

[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.100]
All right. In Hawaii? Come on.

[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:09.580]
All right. I will.

[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:14.980]
I was just laying out by the pool, catching some Hawaiian rays.

[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:18.160]
And this older guy comes up and sits next to me.

[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.240]
Oh boy.

[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:25.420]
I just thought he was a nice guy and you know, he's lonely or something.

[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.400]
So he starts talking to me and of course I talk back.

[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:35.980]
And his hands start going over towards my chair.

[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.760]
And you haven't heard this. No.

[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.000]
I mean, I kind of move away.

[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.800]
It's kind of an awkward situation to be in.

[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:46.940]
I don't know if anybody's ever been in it, but.

[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:54.420]
But anyway, anyway, instead of this guy didn't ask me to go to the roof for anything.

[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:57.160]
This guy, he asked me if I wanted to go to Europe with him.

[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.240]
Oh my gosh.

[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.320]
Prove Europe at all.

[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:04.860]
Now, are you making this up?

[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:06.480]
I just swear to God.

[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:07.640]
It's swear to God.

[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:08.600]
So when you leave him?

[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:09.700]
Tomorrow.

[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:19.940]
You just follow him where every ghost comes back with the story, is that it?

[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:28.620]
My name is Piccolo and I like you to know.

[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:33.820]
Everywhere I go, I hear nearer I just go.

[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.260]
Young men are nice to me.

[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:38.760]
They bear their chest to me.

[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.920]
There's just one problem.

[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.720]
They don't show the rest to me.

[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.480]
I am very happy living in this country.

[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:54.000]
And to the cause of the nearer I just go.

[01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:59.280]
It's the nearer I just go.

[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:07.200]
Oh, the nearer I just go.

[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:14.640]
I don't want you, anybody, get the wrong idea because he does okay for himself.

[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:19.780]
But if he can get as many women chasing after him as he has guys, he'd be real busy.

[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:21.300]
6.58 on Zeta 4.

[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.960]
Let's take a look at that scoreboard again because I know you're waiting with baited breath.

[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.160]
I see you've got your seepa call out already.

[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:30.920]
In the NBA playoffs, man, the Lakers looking desperate.

[01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:34.200]
They have, they looked so bad that even I could have played better, okay?

[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:38.080]
The Dallas Mavericks, 118, the Lakers, 104 to tie the series into two.

[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:42.160]
And the Celix will lose to the pistons in Detroit again this afternoon at 330.

[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.700]
And the Dallas and L.A. tomorrow for game five.

[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:46.280]
Is that correct?

[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.340]
No, the pistons are from Detroit.

[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:54.840]
In the Major League yesterday in the American League Milwaukee 7, Cleveland 2, Toronto 4,

[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:58.720]
Chicago 3, Minnesota 6 to Tigers 3, Tigers from Detroit.

[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:04.680]
Where else be Texas 12 to 1, Baltimore 3, the Angels 2, the Athletics beat the Red Sox 5 to 4,

[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:10.080]
and the damn Yankees, they play those tough teams like Toaston State, Yankee 7, Seattle 3.

[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:14.220]
Now, should league the Dodgers beat the X-Boats 2 to 1, the Padres beat the Met 6 to 3,

[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:18.900]
Phillies over to Giants 4 to 2, Cardinals 3 to Braves 1, Astros beat the Cubs 7 to 1,

[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.020]
and the Pirates were now only 3 and a half out beat the Reds 4 to 2.

[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.520]
And that's it, K-659 on Zeta 4th.

[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:27.720]
I kneel.

[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.160]
Yes, I hope you beat me in the ring.

[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.000]
You better than I am.

[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:36.740]
Even the competition agrees, the Neil Rogers show on WZTA Miami Beach Fort Lauderdale in the Palm Beaches

[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:39.320]
is the best morning show in South Florida.

[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:43.060]
I think I don't get to 9, you're on an AM station as a hero in my book.

[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.480]
You're like 6 hours to quiet, you got no problem with me.

[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:50.040]
Even the other morning shows listen to the Neil Rogers show on Zeta 4.

[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:52.120]
I hope you beat me in the ring, you better than I am.

[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.280]
Well, so is everybody else.

[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.320]
Seven o'clock on Zeta 4 and the question continues to be,

[01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.900]
are they ever going to tell anyone where Joey went or what happened?

[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.320]
Are they just going to keep...

[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.520]
Well, Stonewall and you.

[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:04.100]
That's a good time to say again, we would love to have him come on the show

[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:06.720]
when he gets all his business done with them and he's all done.

[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:09.160]
The invitation stands, Joey, you're welcome on the show any time.

[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:09.760]
Please.

[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:10.600]
Yes, lovely.

[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.380]
Please come in, let's hear the straight poop from what went on over there, okay?

[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:17.240]
I want to hear about the day that Tannaglia was chasing the plumber around

[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.880]
or the clean up guy around with a ball-peen hammer.

[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.260]
It is one happy family, isn't it?

[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:23.980]
Yeah, they must really love each other over there.

[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.980]
Almost as much as we all love each other here at Zeta.

[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.780]
Uh-huh, Tannaglia went in and fired the program director's wife who was doing midday.

[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.820]
Yeah, I always get so a lot of points with the PD.

[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:34.080]
They always find it.

[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:36.180]
It's just like a love fest over there at Sheet.

[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:39.480]
And we have some really innovative bumper stickers about Sheet

[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:41.220]
that we're going to be passing out of next appearance.

[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.860]
Okay, we got somebody on hold here while he's doing the payroll.

[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:46.440]
Are you just listening on hold, sir?

[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.620]
Yes, I am.

[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.080]
Great show.

[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:48.820]
Thank you.

[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:50.720]
In other words, you just called to be put on hold now.

[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:51.580]
You don't have a radio?

[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.480]
Well, I have one in the truck that I listen to all the time,

[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.180]
but I'm in an office in Jupiter here.

[01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:58.440]
I just don't have the reception that I need to get you guys.

[01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.680]
But I didn't want to miss any of it.

[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.540]
Wait a minute, you're on Jupiter?

[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:01.220]
Huh?

[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.260]
You're on Jupiter or Uranus?

[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:04.440]
Well, I'm in Jupiter, buddy.

[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.180]
Okay, listen, hold on.

[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:06.820]
I will keep you on.

[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:07.440]
Oh, well, you're in Jupiter.

[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.180]
No wonder you can't hear it on it right now, right?

[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:09.520]

[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:10.440]
Okay, hold on.

[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:11.600]
All right, you're paying for this, right?

[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.160]
Absolutely.

[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.160]
Okay, hold on.

[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:13.900]
We like that.

[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.000]
He's still in the whole show.

[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.280]
And psychologically, that's good, too, because he keeps that one line lit.

[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:19.800]
Although I will say this.

[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:22.160]
I don't understand, but every line is lit here, and that's frightening.

[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.020]
Okay, on a holiday?

[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:24.560]
I know, you're kidding.

[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:25.440]
Yeah, is it really?

[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:26.280]
I'm dead cereal.

[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:26.980]
Hmm.

[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.700]
Okay, let's go to North Lauderdale.

[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:28.980]
Hello.

[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:30.440]
Hello.

[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:31.040]
Hello.

[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:31.620]
How are you?

[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:32.220]
All right.

[01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:34.080]
You know what?

[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:38.640]
I've actually been reduced to watching basketball, because it's the only thing Detroit teams

[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.300]
to be able to win.

[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:39.940]
Yeah.

[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:42.900]
And they're very shaky too, by the way.

[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.680]
Yeah, the Tigers are not doing that bad, though.

[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.460]
Tigers are, let me take a look here.

[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:49.480]
Okay, Tigers are only four games out.

[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:50.480]
Not too bad.

[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:51.800]
They're nine games over 500.

[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:52.840]
They're not doing too bad.

[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:54.620]
Yeah, because I'm from Detroit.

[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:57.980]
And you're like the only person in the entire state of Florida who's still a Detroit fan.

[01:07:58.220 --> 01:07:59.040]
I can't believe it.

[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.440]
Who said I'm a Detroit fan?

[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:02.720]
When did you ever hear that?

[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.560]
I don't know.

[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.960]
You just talked about him.

[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:07.160]
Well, because I like the pistons because they're playing the Celtics.

[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.960]
I like anybody when they're playing the Celtics.

[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.540]
I love the piston.

[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:11.680]
That's right.

[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.120]
I hope they beat the crap out of him.

[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:14.500]
I hope two more minutes on over with.

[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:15.640]
Now, now, thanks, sir.

[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.220]
Now, where did the Detroit Tigers spring train?

[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:18.800]
Oh, gee.

[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:19.580]
Here we go again.

[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:20.280]
Arizona.

[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:21.060]
No.

[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.360]
Don't be wish.

[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:23.860]
What are you talking?

[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:24.480]
Arizona.

[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:27.020]
Even more than the Anderthal than Arizona.

[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:27.560]
Okay.

[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:29.820]
In Lakeland, Florida.

[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:30.460]
Oh, no.

[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:31.360]
Oh, yeah.

[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:31.820]
Oh, no.

[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.440]
But I have good news for you.

[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.840]
I have good news for you.

[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:36.700]
Black city.

[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:37.240]
Huh?

[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:39.700]
Is it Detroit, a mainly a black city?

[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.100]
What's that got to do with it?

[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:42.460]
Have they training in a red neck town?

[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:44.380]
Hey, let me ask you.

[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.620]
Have you ever heard of Taylor Michigan?

[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.260]
Um, I don't know.

[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:49.040]
Well, trust me.

[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:50.360]
That's one of the Detroit suburbs.

[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:51.320]
And I got news for you.

[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:55.340]
There are more red necks in Taylor than you'll find in Perine, Homestead, and Cutler Ridge put together.

[01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:56.040]
That's right.

[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:56.800]
Trust me.

[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.700]
And they got a stake in Lakeland.

[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:00.340]
So there is something to be said for that.

[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:00.620]
Yeah.

[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.380]
So come on.

[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:04.240]
So don't cut your red necks before they hatch.

[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:05.760]
Get with it, all right?

[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.560]
Don't cut your red necks before those pickled eggs hatch at 7-11.

[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.620]
You know that one guy who won their lottery?

[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:12.100]
Yeah.

[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:13.200]
What a douchebag, huh?

[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:14.700]
I'm getting that claim $12 million.

[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:16.520]
He'll claim it real quietly.

[01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:20.040]
I'll come in in the middle of the night and say, you know, with a gun and say, give me my money.

[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.500]
And Martinez will hand it over to him.

[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:22.020]
It'll be all over.

[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:25.540]
See, in Florida, you've got to collect your money in the middle of the night because the governor is a vampire.

[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:30.420]
And he is not, when the son is out, Martinez is in his crypt, okay?

[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:32.280]
How did he manage to get into office?

[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.160]
Not because there were a lot of morons in his state.

[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:36.900]
They heard Martinez, Martinez, and they said, okay, it's okay with me.

[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.460]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:41.080]
Now all of a sudden they all want him out because he's a disaster.

[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:41.960]
He's a moron.

[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:42.420]
Yeah.

[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:44.420]
And that's the best thing we can say about him.

[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.600]
We should send him to Arizona's governor.

[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:47.180]
Exactly.

[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.120]
I like that.

[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.560]
Yeah, he and Meekam could do.

[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:51.840]
They make a good team out there, okay?

[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:52.600]

[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.120]
Okay, listen, have a wonderful life.

[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.560]
And the call, oh, Eric, let's see.

[01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:57.380]
You're not the guy I hold.

[01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.060]
Who are you anyway?

[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.700]
I'm some high school student.

[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:02.180]
I forgot that I didn't have school today.

[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:04.320]
And I set my alarm to get up at 5.30 in the morning.

[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.780]
Oh, in other words, you're like a dummy, right?

[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:06.160]
Yeah.

[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.940]
Okay, now what school do you go to?

[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:08.540]
Creek.

[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:09.660]
Creek.

[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:10.320]
Creek high school.

[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:11.500]
Coconut Creek high?

[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:11.900]
Yeah.

[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.420]
Coconut Creek like is in wind more?

[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:14.940]
Yeah.

[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.640]
Yeah, a bunch of young whippest snappers up there?

[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:18.760]
Okay.

[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:20.460]
Good luck to you, sir.

[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:20.960]
You'll need this.

[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:21.820]
Oh, I know.

[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:23.060]
Okay, I'll see you at the early bird.

[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:25.080]
Bye-bye.

[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:25.440]
Bye.

[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:26.620]
Okay, there he goes.

[01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:28.560]
Can you imagine growing up in coconut creek?

[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:29.980]
I wonder if he's got a one-de-mug.

[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:32.580]
Well, at least he's close to where he can buy those

[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:34.620]
WNWS tickets.

[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:35.180]
True.

[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:36.080]
Oh, yeah, that's right.

[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.160]
If you go over to one more village, you can buy your tickets

[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:41.860]
or are also sensory village for the WS News reunion.

[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.300]
When the hell is that going to be?

[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.740]
I don't know, but don't they give you some fiber one when you buy your tickets?

[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:46.880]
And they give you fiber one.

[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:49.800]
Seriously, that'll be a five-per-one on the year.

[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.080]
And if you've seen the book and your demographics believe me.

[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.780]
Next thing they'll be giving away polo dents.

[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.300]
A glass for every listener.

[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.260]
A wonder denser holder.

[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.560]
705 on Zeta 4.

[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:05.880]
Oh, gee, it's time to do something here.

[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.060]
We'll come back and continue.

[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:08.220]
Don't you like all these requests?

[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.000]
One day I said they could do requests.

[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:10.740]
We are getting in.

[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:12.000]
Well, are you surprised?

[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:12.660]
I enjoy, yeah.

[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:13.320]
That's what I think.

[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:13.920]
Awesome guy did call.

[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.280]
He wanted to know if, um,

[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.480]
what was the name of it now?

[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.660]
On the part of the Raiders,

[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:20.080]
it was some real weird title.

[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:21.900]
Well, how about...

[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:23.100]
Doggins, suds or something?

[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:24.080]
Doggins suds, yeah.

[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:26.360]
We recorded in Laeclin.

[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.080]
Ups and downs.

[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:27.740]
No.

[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000]
Great airplane strike.

[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:30.760]
Legend of Paul Revere, good thing.

[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.520]
Hungry kicks melody for an unknown girl just like me stepping out,

[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:34.620]
Louis Gohomen, Louis Louis.

[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:35.800]
No, that's not it.

[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.120]
Well, it's not on there. Sorry, pal.

[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.500]
Anyway, if you're a driver with multiple traffic violations

[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.500]
or if you drive a high-performance car that's hard to ensure,

[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.940]
you know how much of a pain in the butt and how unbelievably expensive it is

[01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:48.800]
to get car insurance.

[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.380]
It's frightening.

[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.180]
It could put you right out of business, okay?

[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:54.080]
Well, what you need to do is call AOK Auto Insurance.

[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.340]
AOK Auto Insurance agencies are located all over Broward County

[01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:01.020]
and they specialize in hard to ensure drivers.

[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:04.700]
Now, with AOK, you might even qualify for a plan they have under which

[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:09.020]
your first five tickets won't be assessed against your insurance premiums.

[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:11.240]
But you have to call them to find out if you qualify.

[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.480]
Just check with information and get the number of AOK Auto Insurance Office nearest you.

[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:19.380]
So, if you'd like to drive hard and fast and you've got a few tickets,

[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.180]
AOK Insurance agencies can get you the insurance you need

[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:24.800]
and most likely save you with ton of money in the process.

[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:26.500]
So, go ahead, drive that Trans Am.

[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:30.620]
Z28, Supra, Jeep or other four-wheel-driver high-performance vehicle.

[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.820]
Have a great time. That's Ferrari.

[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:34.640]
That's Porsche, whatever the hell it is.

[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:36.980]
And get your insurance from AOK Auto Insurance.

[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:41.640]
Remember, just call information to find the AOK Insurance Office nearest you

[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.900]
and it comes to saving you money on your car insurance.

[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:45.800]
They're AOK.

[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:46.760]
OK?

[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:47.500]
OK?

[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:47.960]
OK.

[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:52.840]
Mostly cloudy today with scattered showers and thunderstorms, 50% chance.

[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:58.900]
And high will be mid-80s, tonight mid-70s, 72 on Zeta 4 at 707.

[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.940]
It was 13 years ago today.

[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.160]
When Zeta 4 began this way, what the...

[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:05.940]
Who's counting?

[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:09.000]
OK, OK. Maybe it wasn't 13 years ago today.

[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:10.380]
But the legend lives on.

[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:14.300]
I'm Captain Dave Capri to hear to tell you about Zeta 4's 13th anniversary party.

[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.560]
At the Keegan Can Inn, this coming Wednesday night.

[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:20.280]
I'll be there from 8 to 11 pm with a huge chunk of a Zeta stash to give away.

[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:25.020]
Like plenty of Zeta 4 T-shirts, those incredibly gorgeous and sexually stimulating Zeta plates,

[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.160]
keychains, can coolers, and tickets to see Rod Stewart,

[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:31.380]
Hollinoten Chicago in concerted Joe Robbie Stadium on July 3rd.

[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:36.380]
Plus, your chance at round trip airfare for two to anywhere Mexican airways flies.

[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:39.260]
There's no purchase necessary, but you must be 21 to enter.

[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:43.980]
I'll see you this Wednesday for the Zeta 4 13th anniversary party at the Keegan Can Inn,

[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.080]
with live rock and roll from Auto Drive.

[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:51.140]
The Keegan Can located in the Club Plaza shopping center on the corner of Northwest 67th Avenue

[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:52.340]
and Miami Gardens Drive.

[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:57.020]
That's just about a mile north of the Palmeadow, from 13 years of South Florida's Classic Drive.

[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:57.860]
Zeta 4.

[01:13:58.020 --> 01:13:59.760]
OK, thank you so much, Captain Monge.

[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.820]
It's eight minutes after 7 on Zeta 4.

[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:02.860]
And...

[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:04.400]
Well, what's wrong? We had a little feedback there.

[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:04.880]
All right.

[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:05.400]
Don't you?

[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:07.820]
Well, every now and then it keeps these people under toes.

[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:11.880]
And what was I just going to do? This is perfect speaking event.

[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:17.060]
You know, it takes all kinds of people to make America what it is today.

[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:20.300]
It takes doctors, glow, and lawyers,

[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.120]
Hi there.

[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.740]
Accountants, and librarians.

[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:26.740]
But it also takes much more than that.

[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.280]
It also takes America's morons.

[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.680]
Use your signal, you idiot!

[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:33.880]
Good morning!

[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:34.940]
You know us?

[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.560]
Why we're all around you.

[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.300]
We're taking 200 items through the express lane of the supermarket.

[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.500]
Wait, let me get my other car to go over here.

[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:46.420]
We're sitting behind you in the movie theater, wrapping our Christmas gifts.

[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:50.360]
You're the food, you're the food, and we're holding up your bank line.

[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:52.860]
While we try to cash a check from the Bank of Venus.

[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.720]
Hey, pal, could you hurry it up?

[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:56.260]
Why, how are you?

[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:59.340]
We're the association of ignorant Americans.

[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:01.240]
And we're always looking for new members.

[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:04.820]
So if you hate any minority, don't read much and just love to litter.

[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:08.000]
Then have a friend dial the phone for you and give us a call.

[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:13.060]
Just dial area code 632-626-6766 or...

[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:14.000]
Mia Mimoron.

[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:16.760]
Hi, I'm Mimoron.

[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.840]
You look like in the morning.

[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.960]
Oh, was you sleeping?

[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:21.900]

[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:25.740]
America's morons.

[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:28.580]
We're taking years off your life.

[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.100]
Neil wakes me up in the morning.

[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:32.140]
In the morning.

[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.440]
Neil wakes me up with a smile.

[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.000]
When the smile is in.

[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:39.020]
Drinking my coffee, bunching down my donut.

[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:41.400]
Whips in the floor of the dark.

[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:46.020]
Get ready to go to school with Neil.

[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.640]
Whips in the floor of the dial.

[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:53.260]
Trying to do work in my world with a daily meal.

[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.380]
Whips in the table for on my dial.

[01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:56.440]
Oh, really?

[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.220]
Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil.

[01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.880]
Whips in the floor of the dial.

[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:01.180]
Neil, Neil, Neil, Neil.

[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:02.480]
Neil, Neil, Neil.

[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:05.760]
Anyway, it's a 10 past seven.

[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:08.640]
On Zeta 4.

[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.560]
And isn't it great to be here on this holiday?

[01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:14.480]
Doesn't it look like it's breaking up just a little?

[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:16.440]
I think you're wishing.

[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:17.880]
Huh?

[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:18.720]
Thank you're wishing.

[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.600]
Doesn't it look like a great day for a barbecue?

[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:25.220]
Yeah, underneath the...

[01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:25.640]
It's Memorial Day.

[01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:26.340]
Don't you understand?

[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:28.980]
On this day, it's supposed to be perfect for...

[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:30.180]
It's not as supposed to shine.

[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:31.680]
It's in blue skies.

[01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:34.100]
Now, do I have to take responsibility for this?

[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:34.280]
Yeah.

[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:34.780]
Oh.

[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:36.100]
Because I do the weather.

[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:36.580]
Do you do the weather?

[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:40.660]
We've got a list of what it looks like in other parts of the country coming up in a little bit.

[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:42.220]
I'm actually, we don't have any traffic today.

[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.220]
There is a...

[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:44.480]
Owl's not working today.

[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:46.760]
No, the weather's rough and...

[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.440]
There's no traffic.

[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:47.740]
Yeah.

[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:49.540]
One day, enjoy it.

[01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:50.740]
You know, check it.

[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:52.440]
Nope.

[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:53.420]
He's not working today.

[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:54.660]
All I hear is just...

[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:55.160]
Yeah.

[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.120]
Maybe we could put that on here for a few minutes, okay?

[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:00.120]
Okay, we have a Zeta spy in Dade County.

[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:00.460]
Hello.

[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:01.720]
How are you?

[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:04.300]
First of all, you were talking about she for a little while before.

[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:07.200]
We expect from a radio station based out of a trailer.

[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:08.740]
Are they really?

[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:09.240]
Together.

[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:10.240]
Oh, you didn't know that?

[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.740]
They're in a trailer in Davy.

[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:12.820]
It's a fixed up trailer.

[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:13.820]
In a trailer.

[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.020]
Well, that sounds pretty...

[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:17.260]
That sounds like it ought to be in...

[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:18.320]
Oh, could Shelby or somewhere?

[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:19.680]
Or Kasimmi or Lakeland?

[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:20.780]
Or Milton?

[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:21.900]
But they're in Davy.

[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:22.640]
What do we see?

[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:23.220]
Davy.

[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:23.660]
Yeah.

[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:23.720]
Yeah.

[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:27.260]
Anyway, on to Zeta, on to your Zeta spy report.

[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.000]
I went...

[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.620]
I had radio accident this weekend,

[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.620]
and GTR came on my car radio.

[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:35.300]
And they premiered their new Rambo,

[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:36.960]
where are you going with that gun in your hand?

[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.920]
Is it as good as the Jamaican Bob's Lead Team?

[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:43.500]
The Jamaican Bob's Lead Song, compared to it, is funny.

[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:45.220]
Oh, boy.

[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:47.420]
That says it all, I think.

[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:48.500]
It's that bad.

[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:50.440]
You think they'll send us a coffee?

[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:52.960]
It's a fake deal.

[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:54.480]
I think you would off the air,

[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:55.740]
and then you throw it away,

[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:56.980]
because it's not worth your time.

[01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:00.600]
You'll probably call GTR and ask for money.

[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:02.460]
It takes the time to judge the listen.

[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:06.580]
They're actually going to put this thing out on a 45.

[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:09.300]
So, yeah, they're playing this like in their normal rotation.

[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:10.200]
You heard it like that.

[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:11.960]
Oh, yeah, they're playing both of them in their normal rotation.

[01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:13.080]
Oh, my God.

[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.300]
They're little things in a GTR exclusive.

[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:17.520]
You won't hear this on any other radio station,

[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:19.620]
and they play both of them.

[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:20.780]
It's a regular rotation.

[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.940]
It was on this morning, as a matter of fact.

[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:24.780]
My sister's got her radio on there.

[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:27.240]
What a surprise.

[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:30.320]
Is there nothing you can do about your sister?

[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:31.440]
Oh, I've tried.

[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:36.700]
She's into indicators and monkeys, I guess.

[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:37.200]
I don't know.

[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:40.240]
Oh, okay.

[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:41.700]
You want to request.

[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:42.800]
I've got one for you.

[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:43.180]

[01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:44.840]
Vanna picked me a letter.

[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:46.860]
Vanna picked my nose.

[01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:49.200]
Oh, that's by Mike Rinerri, isn't it?

[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.320]
I think so.

[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:51.220]
Vanna picked my nose.

[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.920]
He sings it every morning on that show, doesn't he?

[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:53.620]
Right out.

[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.440]
I've got one that really is going to reach out.

[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:57.020]
Two of those.

[01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:58.160]
You're right, D.

[01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:58.860]
You're legal ID.

[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.000]
What do you mean by that?

[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.740]
Um, the BCC legal ID.

[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:03.680]
Oh, yeah.

[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:05.020]
Yeah, I'll do that out for you.

[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:05.700]
I'll do that for a little while.

[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.900]
That would be good right on the heel of that one about Morons.

[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:08.600]
That would be perfect.

[01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:10.620]
Okay, listen, have a great life.

[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:11.220]
You too.

[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:11.760]
See you later.

[01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:12.040]
Bye.

[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.760]
Get me a ticket for an aeroplane.

[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.180]
Got to get on the Wheel of Fortune game.

[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:23.320]
I just got to win.

[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:24.880]
Spin the wheel again.

[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:27.160]
Oh, Vanna picked me a letter.

[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:27.780]
Thanks, Rob.

[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:28.700]
What do you mean, bank?

[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.100]
I don't care how much money I got to spend.

[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:35.040]
Can't stand to look at that stage, I can't get again.

[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:36.640]
Won't throw in the towers.

[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:38.300]
Still like by your powers.

[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.480]
Oh, Vanna picked me a letter.

[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.920]
Hey, man, what do you mean there's no F and F?

[01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:44.820]
Vanna picked me a letter.

[01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:46.520]
No one does it any better.

[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.120]
I dream of both you.

[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:50.160]
Hey, Vanna, is that an all over town or what?

[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:53.500]
Vanna, I don't understand why you make a hundred grand.

[01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:54.820]
Not for me to say.

[01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:59.480]
Anyway, get me a ticket for an aeroplane.

[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:02.740]
Got to be on the Wheel of Fortune game.

[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:04.840]
I just got to win.

[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.420]
Spin the wheel again.

[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:08.800]
Oh, Vanna picked me a letter.

[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:11.540]
Go, Vanna, go, baby, go, alright.

[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:13.780]
Hey, get out of my face, bank.

[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:15.020]
Is that a two-way?

[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:17.120]
Hey, is there an L in that word?

[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:18.200]
Is the low rider?

[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:19.880]
Alright, low rider!

[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.860]
Forget the letter, man, I'll take Vanna away.

[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:23.780]
You beautiful baby.

[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.260]
You and me could play the home game.

[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.480]
Got me a ticket for an aeroplane.

[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:28.380]
Alright!

[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.000]
I'm on the Wheel of Fortune game.

[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:33.160]
I just love that sound.

[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:34.580]
I'm in the bonus round.

[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.980]
Hey, Vanna, pick me a letter.

[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:38.280]
Lose a turn.

[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:39.640]
Hey, pack, lose this.

[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.400]
Vanna picked me a letter.

[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.080]
No one does it any better.

[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.720]
I dream about you.

[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.720]
Alright, that isn't all over, Dan.

[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:48.440]
Vanna, I don't mean to stare.

[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:49.920]
But are you wearing underwear?

[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:51.320]
Not for me to say.

[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:52.760]
Anyway!

[01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:55.940]
I don't care how much money I got to spend.

[01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:59.520]
Can't stand to look at that sage, Jack again.

[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:03.220]
Won't throw in the towel till I buy your bowels.

[01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:05.280]
Oh, Vanna, pick me a letter.

[01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:08.660]
Please, Vanna, pick me a letter.

[01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:11.400]
Alright, I'm ready to pick, baby.

[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:15.220]
ABCD, FG, HGJ, GAL, NLP, GWH, WS, YZ.

[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:16.620]
That's your cover, man.

[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:21.060]
Alright, I'll take the sofa, the blender, the microwave, the refrigerator.

[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:22.920]
Hey, man, what do you mean?

[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.820]
$500 for a black and white five in portable TV set.

[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.280]
You got ripped off, man.

[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.560]
My brother and I forget it for your whole sales.

[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.140]
Give me the money and I'll buy the TV set, man.

[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:32.480]
Alright?

[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:33.920]
Hey, Vanna, come on, baby.

[01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:40.940]
Now, huh?

[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:48.100]
Every time of my life, I'm in a field.

[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.520]
I hate that song.

[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:55.560]
Harry Callahan is back.

[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:58.920]
And this time, he's blowing away the cat skills.

[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:03.900]
You know, baby, in all this excitement, I've forgotten you.

[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:03.900]

[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:03.900]

[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:10.420]
If this routine has six steps or only five, but seen as how dance is the most powerful

[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:16.380]
form of personal expression in the whole world, and can blow your feet clean off, you got

[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:17.880]
to ask yourself one question.

[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:19.220]
Ooh, what's that, Harry?

[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:21.580]
Do you want to rangay?

[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:23.200]
Well, do you?

[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:24.420]
Punk.

[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:29.760]
It's Clint Eastwood and Jennifer Gray in dirty, hairy dancing.

[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:34.680]
Go ahead, make my shit tape.

[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.980]
What, we're getting these on so fast.

[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:43.020]
We are getting the request on faster than the people can call to ask for them, which is incredible.

[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:47.740]
717 on Zeta 4 and our next call is from Miami.

[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:48.140]
Hello.

[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:48.720]
Hi.

[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:49.300]
Hi.

[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:50.320]
How you doing?

[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:50.920]
Pretty good.

[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:51.420]
How you doing?

[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:52.080]
Okay.

[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.840]
How are you up so early on this God-for-sacin' day?

[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.240]
It was the other guy set my alarm clock.

[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:57.900]
Oh, okay.

[01:22:58.420 --> 01:22:58.780]
Good.

[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:01.000]
You're a bit behind.

[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:01.800]
What do you mean?

[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:07.700]
Well, you coming on the, I hear you on the phone and then the radio is a couple seconds faster.

[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.480]
Yeah, well the radio is a little slow, you know?

[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:11.180]
Radio is taking a Ciesta.

[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:12.800]
No one afforded a half-second delay.

[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:14.580]
I want to know another thing.

[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:15.040]
Yeah.

[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:17.260]
Why don't you just take the show and go on vacation?

[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:18.920]
What do you mean?

[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.660]
I mean, this is a vacation day, right?

[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:22.160]
Mm-hmm.

[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:22.980]
This is a holiday.

[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:23.640]
Yeah.

[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.100]
Why are you here?

[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:27.480]
That's a good question because I'm a fool, I guess.

[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:27.960]
I don't know.

[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:31.660]
I just, they said I could have this day off and we would all have the day off, I guess.

[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:33.460]
But I just, I don't like doing that.

[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.620]
I like saving up my days for what I really want them.

[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:38.380]
Plus, it's a putrid day anyway, so who would want to be off today?

[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:43.760]
I'd rather be off on a nice sunny day when I can go into pool and lounge around a relax.

[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:44.540]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:45.440]
I'm gonna Hawaii.

[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:46.620]
What do you mean?

[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:47.520]
I've already been there.

[01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:49.500]
Okay.

[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:50.660]
Find somewhere else to go then.

[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:52.600]
You're anxious to get rid of me, huh?

[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:53.180]
No.

[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:55.260]
You just want me to go have a good time?

[01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:55.740]
Yeah.

[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.020]
Okay, well I work on it.

[01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.240]
In about five to ten minutes I'll figure out someplace good, okay?

[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.060]
You know what I hate?

[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:04.160]
What's that?

[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:08.120]
Hey, these stupid people on the airport.

[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.860]
Because, you know, I'm from Canada.

[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:11.280]
Every summer.

[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:12.100]
For the full of me.

[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:13.820]
And winter, I go up to visit my dad.

[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:14.480]
Mm-hmm.

[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:20.260]
One of the times in the winter I was in the airport, you know, half asleep because it takes six hours

[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:24.200]
because they had the Toronto runways where I'll shut off except for one.

[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:24.780]
Mm-hmm.

[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:28.360]
Supposedly repairing them, why in the middle of winter I don't know why.

[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:36.440]
But, um, so we're waiting here and one of the other kids about my age who was waiting in line comes up and asks me

[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:39.160]
whether we live in igloo or not.

[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:40.000]
Yeah.

[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:40.700]
Going to Toronto.

[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:41.300]
Yeah.

[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:44.460]
I was sitting here asking myself, is this guy for real?

[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:46.680]
By the way, before you go I have a question for you, okay?

[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:47.060]
Yeah.

[01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:49.420]
You guys in Toronto living igloo's?

[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:52.940]
No, I got a request for you though.

[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.120]
Okay, what is it?

[01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:55.220]
Um, Mr. Postman.

[01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:55.960]
Okay.

[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:56.880]
All right, thanks.

[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:57.520]
Have a good one.

[01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:58.500]
Bye-bye.

[01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:00.460]
It's 719 on Zeta 4 men.

[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.280]
And now the problem is we're getting so many requests.

[01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:04.180]
Look at this, I've got these piled up to the sky.

[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:07.700]
That's okay because it'll kill a lot of time, right?

[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:08.040]
That's right.

[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:10.020]
And everybody's calling and saying, how come you're working?

[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:10.720]
It's a holiday.

[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:12.220]
Why don't you just go relax?

[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.080]
Go to Hawaii?

[01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:17.020]
And now we have the usual bunch calling and saying, go to hell.

[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:18.100]
That stuff too, you know.

[01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:21.840]
Now you just played something I hadn't heard a long time, Vanna.

[01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:22.340]
Yeah.

[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:23.300]
Don't pick me a letter.

[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:24.140]
Or pick my nose.

[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:26.080]
When we have a story about Vanna today.

[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:27.040]
You don't fake.

[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:29.500]
It's how this all works out, even on a holiday.

[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:34.900]
An unreleased movie, which features racy scenes of Vanna White

[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:35.800]
exploding around.

[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:36.000]

[01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:40.820]
And movie is called Gypsy Angels and it was filmed six years ago.

[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:44.200]
And it shows Vanna in a G-string.

[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:45.600]
Yeah.

[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:55.100]
Jack Bricknell, who was a, who was a Pizza Hut franchise dealer of all people

[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:56.560]
was trying to get that film released.

[01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:58.560]
I don't understand that person.

[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.800]
I'm sure it all fits together somehow.

[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:04.460]
That Vanna.

[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:04.500]
Yeah.

[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:05.840]
Yeah.

[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.720]
Interesting you would play that under a story about Vanna White.

[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:12.180]

[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:13.820]
Well, I think there's some connection there to be honest with you.

[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:20.280]
It's 20 past seven on Zeta 4 and this is Memorial Day All Request Party block.

[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:21.220]
No repeat.

[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:21.880]
No repeat.

[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:22.940]
Something.

[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:25.720]
Something party day and we'll continue right after this.

[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:26.980]
Well, this is really exciting.

[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:29.420]
724 on Zeta 4, we have a big day.

[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:31.820]
We have Captain Dave and we have Dave Lamont.

[01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:33.560]
Yeah, there's too many Dave's.

[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.260]
From the AM sports room.

[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:39.740]
This morning filling in filling those big shoes of Ron Harrison comes up just like Harrison.

[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:42.240]
And if you could see what was in those shoes, you would lose your breakfast.

[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:43.660]
Okay, it's just disgusting.

[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:44.700]
What's in those shoes?

[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.900]
Some, some about the sports guys on AM.

[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:49.420]
They're always looking for an audience.

[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:49.900]
Have you noticed?

[01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:52.560]
They always come up here because they know that this is where the audience.

[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:53.200]
They saw the book.

[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:53.460]
Yeah.

[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:56.380]
So who did the, who's doing the morning show over there?

[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:58.560]
Big, whatever your name is.

[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:00.060]
I don't know what to call him.

[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:00.740]
He's going to have some.

[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.200]
We got big Captain.

[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:04.200]
Mr. Sports.

[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:04.880]
A matter of me.

[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:05.740]
Mr. Sports is fine.

[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:06.100]
I was here.

[01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:06.740]
He doesn't take a day.

[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.480]
Okay, so who's doing a morning show there?

[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.420]
I'm sure Mike and Arlene are taking the day off, right?

[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:11.160]
No, they're in there.

[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:11.960]
They're in there.

[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:12.900]
Wow.

[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:15.400]
So if there are those of you out there who really want to be titillated.

[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:17.720]
And are into gigantic butts.

[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:18.920]
Turn on the AM.

[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:19.800]
Turn on wins, man.

[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:20.540]
For a couple of months.

[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.140]
And you'll come racing back over here.

[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:24.740]
You'll be begging us to let you back in on the show.

[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:25.720]
Right?

[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:27.600]
Sort of like guys who do sports today.

[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:27.960]
In the show.

[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.740]
So we've even got somebody listening in Jupiter right on hold.

[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:32.120]
Are you still there?

[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:33.880]
Oh, Neil, it's not Jupiter, Neil.

[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.080]
Neil, I wouldn't live out in the mother planet.

[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:37.740]
I live out in Boynton Beach.

[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:38.880]
Oh, that's Jupiter.

[01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:46.420]
And just to tell you that there are people out here that listen to Neil, the captain, and of course, the bird.

[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:47.680]
The captain and the Neil, yeah.

[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:50.540]
So anyway, no, are you, but you're on hold, right?

[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:51.300]
We're on hold.

[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:52.260]
Okay, hold on.

[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:52.720]
Okay.

[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:56.660]
I just want to check every now and then to make sure you're still, you know, you're not fun enough, so, okay?

[01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:57.320]
I'm fun on you.

[01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:57.760]
Okay.

[01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.260]
I have a request.

[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.080]
It's all I want to say.

[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:00.360]
Okay.

[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:01.240]
What is it?

[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.980]
The request is, of course, roster Jew and be true to your show.

[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:05.340]
Okay.

[01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:05.980]
They're coming up.

[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:06.460]
All right.

[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:06.880]
Okay.

[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.120]
And a good y'all to see you too.

[01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:08.940]
Thank you very much.

[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:09.720]
Good y'all to see you.

[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:10.240]
Hold on.

[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.600]
Happy Shivuas, by the way.

[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.280]
Well, better late than ever, right?

[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:13.920]
That's true.

[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:14.300]
Hold on.

[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:15.040]
Okay.

[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.340]
See, we even have people just listening on hold.

[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:18.460]
Is that incredible or what?

[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:20.540]
Which means they're probably too cheap to go out and buy a good radio.

[01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:21.860]
26th April.

[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:23.180]
He's only in Boynton Beach.

[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:26.060]
It's not like he's on Neptune or Uranus or something, right?

[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:28.660]
26th after 7 on Zeta 4.

[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:32.060]
You've been very quiet over there this morning and then you're going to accuse me after the

[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:34.860]
show that it was Boynt coming in here and I didn't let you say anything.

[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:36.820]
No, I'm having a great time.

[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:36.960]
Good.

[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:37.340]
That's good.

[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:38.460]
Just shut up.

[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:40.680]
Where we going next?

[01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:42.260]
Well, see how to...

[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:43.960]
Now, what is this new thing he brought in here?

[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:44.660]
Essential news?

[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:45.100]
I don't know.

[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.840]
He handed it to me.

[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:48.360]
Should I just try it cold?

[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:49.600]
Why should this be?

[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:50.980]
Any different.

[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.680]
Or, pregame news first.

[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:53.780]
Wait, seconds.

[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:59.080]
They can't always on essential news.

[01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:02.460]
On WTIF.

[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:04.660]
New Orleans, low-wee's Vienna.

[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.660]
What, what was that?

[01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:08.800]
Put that away.

[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:09.720]
What was it?

[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:11.620]
Put it backwards in a rack or something.

[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:14.140]
What the hell was that?

[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:16.780]
Essential news.

[01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:18.620]
Isn't that what we do on this show?

[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.760]
I don't understand what that was supposed to be.

[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:21.160]
No.

[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:22.360]
I don't know either.

[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:23.540]
Oh, good.

[01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:25.540]
Okay, well, here's what it is now.

[01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:27.480]
It's called a dead cart with a label off.

[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:28.500]
Yeah, mark that label.

[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:31.600]
I swear that was almost as good as the Jamaican Bob Slade routine.

[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:34.420]
I didn't mean to offend you with it or anything.

[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:35.640]
Or mind me.

[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:38.020]
No, but I mean, I loved it when people bring stuff in there.

[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.780]
It was just something like the W-A-G-C.

[01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:43.260]
And for MoTec, he used to do that to me on AM.

[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:45.640]
He would bring some wild cart in and I would put it in there

[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:47.040]
and just everybody would look at each other.

[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:48.140]
Like, what is this mean?

[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:50.060]
Speaking of MoTec, do you still...

[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:50.820]
Did you save that thing?

[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:51.800]
I threw it away.

[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:52.460]
You threw it away.

[01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:53.800]
I can get it for you.

[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:54.640]
Yeah, dig that out.

[01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:55.280]
That's kind of cute.

[01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:56.060]
You didn't see it.

[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:56.380]
What?

[01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:57.400]
Where is it?

[01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:58.680]
Where is the picture of him?

[01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:01.060]
Frank MoTec, Gorbitec?

[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:01.500]
No.

[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:02.560]
Do you want to keep this?

[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:03.800]
No, I sure don't.

[01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:05.100]
I'll need a prop again on the room.

[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.300]
I'm not going to a room, all right?

[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:07.400]
All right, so you want it.

[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:07.960]
Oh, thanks.

[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:09.120]
27 after 7.

[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:09.900]
I'll look at that.

[01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:11.320]
What is the name?

[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:12.820]
My name is Frank Gorbitec.

[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:14.440]
Gorbitec, yeah.

[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:15.980]
And look at his face.

[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:18.580]
He's got that fruitful discoloration here in his form.

[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:19.940]
He's up all over the station.

[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:20.580]
They are?

[01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:22.600]
Well, that Frank, I'm telling you.

[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:25.240]
Well, see, he doesn't really have anything to do anymore, so he just wants to run.

[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:27.660]
He makes little funnies, okay?

[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:28.200]
Very little.

[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:31.820]
Yeah, well, it's our writing material for Arlene and Mike in there pretty soon.

[01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:34.660]
God only knows if anybody needs it.

[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:40.040]
28 past 7 on Zeta 4, and let's take a call from...

[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:41.440]
I got such a mountain of stuff here.

[01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:42.160]
I don't know what to do.

[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:42.980]
Miami, hello.

[01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:44.020]
Oh, Neil.

[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:44.680]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.880]
Johnny Depp, I'll stay.

[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:47.560]
Okay.

[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:48.720]
How's he's getting married, right?

[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:52.100]
Oh, it's Star Magazine.

[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.540]
I'm reading it right now.

[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:53.840]
Yeah.

[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:59.520]
His female fans agree that the macho looks suits 21 Jump Street.

[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:00.600]
Honky.

[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:01.980]
Johnny Depp.

[01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:03.000]
Honky or honky?

[01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:03.980]
Honky.

[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:04.640]
Honky.

[01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:05.940]
Who a T.

[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:06.620]
Yeah.

[01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:10.680]
And also, Van a White here.

[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:17.240]
They were filming, and she got her hearing caught.

[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:20.300]
And some of the guys La Palo on his jacket.

[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:21.900]
No, I think you got the stories mixed up.

[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:25.100]
I think Johnny Depp got his hearing caught in some guys La Pal, okay?

[01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:26.860]
Oh, that was Van a White.

[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:27.340]
Okay.

[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:32.640]
Yeah, they were filming just team Deans from St. Barbara.

[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:34.420]
Whatever you say, yeah.

[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:36.620]
So, what do you think?

[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:39.420]
How much do you think Johnny Depp's hearing weighs about 2.5 pounds?

[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:43.700]
I think what this picture here looks like he had a couple pounds of beans.

[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:44.600]
Let's put that way.

[01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:44.920]
Really?

[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:48.640]
Yeah, distorted kind of like, yeah.

[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:49.200]
Yeah.

[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:50.300]
Okay, I got it.

[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:51.080]
Thanks a lot.

[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:52.480]
Have a great life.

[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:53.480]
Well, how is he talking about it?

[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:54.780]
Well, he was asleep, you know.

[01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:58.380]
29 after 7 on say to 4, and don't start knocking Johnny Depp on this show

[01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:01.240]
because he's our buddy and he's a great American, and where's that card?

[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:04.000]
You know the one I mean?

[01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:04.820]
Sure.

[01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:06.860]
I don't think it's here anymore.

[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:07.720]
I think it kind of disappeared.

[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:09.420]
I like there's a lot of noise on the hall.

[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:09.940]
Do you like that?

[01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:12.140]
You hear it?

[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:15.320]
I have no idea what it is because there's not supposed to be anybody here today.

[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:16.640]
There isn't anybody here today.

[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:18.200]
But it's nice to know that even with nobody here.

[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:21.680]
You know, there is something to be said for consistency.

[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:24.920]
I want to happen to Johnny Depp that he like disappear into thin air.

[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:27.720]
Well, this system of yours, you know, I can't.

[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:28.820]
What?

[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:30.820]
Well, you know, I said...

[01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:32.420]
I don't start talking about what you guys did.

[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:33.260]
That was ridiculous.

[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:36.640]
Well, I, you know, I called some grief for that.

[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:37.920]
Oh, here it is right here.

[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:38.740]
It's right in front of me.

[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:39.900]
That's why I was difficult to find.

[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:41.860]
See, I kind of like look under the nooks and crannies.

[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:44.440]
And I make things a lot more difficult than they really are.

[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:44.840]
Okay, you ready?

[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:45.340]
Yeah.

[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:45.940]
Anytime.

[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:47.280]
Okay, this is Johnny Depp.

[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:51.540]
You're listening to my recently purchased radio stations, eight of four.

[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:55.000]
You guys are all fired.

[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.100]
You're all fired.

[01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:57.480]
Thanks a lot, Johnny, for a good American.

[01:32:57.980 --> 01:32:59.300]
Now, they cleaned them up last night.

[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.900]
He was so clean cut and his hair was like...

[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:04.280]
I don't know how to describe it like...

[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:04.660]
Why I like it?

[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.740]
Barbs and shoe polish from the president.

[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:08.900]
And it was like waxed.

[01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:10.260]
Mm-hmm.

[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:12.140]
He looked like he had waxed he'd build up or something.

[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.580]
Like he was going to take a blue cap and stick it over his head.

[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:15.660]
Well, did you see it?

[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:16.640]
I had tried a couple of eggs in there.

[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:20.580]
Did you see it long enough to see what he was doing in the story last night?

[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:22.000]
He was doing what he always is doing.

[01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:22.260]
Really?

[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:23.580]
He was marking in the story.

[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:24.420]
Like he always does.

[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:25.800]
He's always the good guy.

[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:26.600]
I see.

[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:30.260]
And he was marking and they were trying to do all this nasty stuff.

[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:31.580]
And Johnny said, no, no, no.

[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:32.820]
We've got to be on a colonial show.

[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:33.420]
We've got to be nice.

[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:35.700]
731 on sale to four.

[01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:36.940]
We're taking call from plantation.

[01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:37.760]
Hello.

[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:38.880]
How you doing?

[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:39.340]
Pretty good.

[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:43.900]
I wanted to call you to let you know what type of town Lakeland is.

[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:44.500]
Okay.

[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:48.080]
I had the opportunity to go there about two months ago.

[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:49.420]
And I've never been there.

[01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:50.120]
Have you ever been there?

[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:51.200]
Yeah, I've been there.

[01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:51.640]
Okay.

[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:53.020]
Well, we're coming out of highway.

[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:56.060]
And we see this baseball stadium.

[01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:56.900]
It's like a school.

[01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:59.840]
And we're going to get closer to the school.

[01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:00.740]
And we're looking at this.

[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:04.260]
Lakeland high, home of the Drednaught.

[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:05.760]
Oh, yeah, the Drednaught, so.

[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:07.200]
I looked to my friend.

[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.000]
What the heck is a Drednaught?

[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:10.840]
And we couldn't figure it out.

[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:11.760]
You know, we're from up north.

[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:12.780]
We're like a Drednaught.

[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:13.880]
I never heard of a Drednaught.

[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:15.760]
What's that got to do with up north?

[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.760]
How the name was up for high school, Drednaught?

[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:19.120]
Do you know what a Drednaught is?

[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:21.000]
I've a way to found out what it is.

[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:21.680]
It's a ship.

[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:23.600]
It's like a World War II.

[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.580]
Yeah, it's like a sunken battleship.

[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:26.760]
We're a battleship.

[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:28.140]
Yeah, it's like a battleship.

[01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:29.760]
We get to the hotel.

[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:33.260]
And we're in Lakeland.

[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:34.100]
We're going to the show.

[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.500]
We're trying to ask people.

[01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:39.820]

[01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:31.240]
Whatever now, I mean, you're

[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:32.300]
you're you're you're you're you're

[01:43:33.300 --> 01:44:02.280]
you're you're you're you're you're

[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:32.260]
you're you're you're you're you're

[01:44:40.260 --> 01:45:02.240]
you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you're you

your a flower to you your avatar.

[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:32.220]
off all right, before ending that read when that reader was storing the office was storing the office with우

[01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:33.700]
We just don't want too much chaos in here.

[01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:35.340]
I'll leave you all the way to your autograph.

[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:36.580]
Yeah, and he'll bring the shirt in here.

[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:38.900]
We'll all autograph it and then give it back to you.

[01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:40.620]
Oh, but see, I thought we were going to do it

[01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:42.400]
while she was wearing it.

[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:44.220]
Oh, I know.

[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:46.020]
No, she's not going to do that.

[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.440]
No, I'm just going to give you the shirt

[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:48.240]
and like a pen.

[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:49.620]
What a pervert, that is what.

[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.980]
That will really make me happy.

[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:54.720]
Don't come anywhere near this bird, okay?

[01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:56.760]
Trust me.

[01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:58.340]
Okay, so can we do that this morning?

[01:45:58.460 --> 01:45:58.680]
Sure.

[01:45:59.060 --> 01:45:59.540]
Okay, great.

[01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:01.100]
We'll be buying a little while.

[01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:03.060]
I want a silver airborne truck.

[01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:04.620]
Okay, and just buzz out at the gate.

[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:06.040]
There's a buzzer out there and just tell them

[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:08.780]
that you're here for the nightmarish show.

[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:10.340]
And something will happen, okay?

[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:10.940]
Okay, thanks.

[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:11.840]
I really appreciate it.

[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:12.540]
Okay, we'll see you.

[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:12.960]
Okay, bye.

[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:14.880]
Okay, it's 13 till 8.

[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:16.840]
So you're not really nice in accommodating on this show.

[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:18.260]
I better go over there in the morning.

[01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:19.500]
Yeah, you better.

[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:21.400]
There's a couple of weirdos coming over here.

[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:22.280]
What?

[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:23.500]
What do you better go over there?

[01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:25.640]
Can't you just pick up the intercom and call them?

[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:27.500]
Oh, what's the number?

[01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:28.840]
Yeah, see, here's the size.

[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:29.220]
It's got more.

[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:32.120]
Well, I got a check on the user.

[01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:33.160]
Yeah, right.

[01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:35.300]
And we do have a break coming up in a couple of minutes

[01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:37.280]
and then when we go to it, you won't be in there, right?

[01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:38.240]
No, we're waiting.

[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:40.340]
Oh, that's not the way I heard it.

[01:46:40.420 --> 01:46:41.100]
What's amazing?

[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:44.460]
No, no, that's not right.

[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:45.060]
Yeah.

[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:48.740]
Come on, Neil.

[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:49.720]
You know, that's not right.

[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:50.160]
Yeah.

[01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:51.320]
No, no.

[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:53.500]
That's right, Neil.

[01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:56.980]
What?

[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:00.300]
Great idea.

[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:03.140]
Well, you got me there.

[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:05.020]
Wait, let's start over.

[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:06.160]
It's true.

[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:07.480]
Holy cow.

[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:08.860]
No way.

[01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:11.380]
Well, I can't say absolutely not.

[01:47:11.780 --> 01:47:11.920]
Yeah.

[01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:14.760]
I don't think it's legal in the state of Florida, though.

[01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:15.900]
Yeah.

[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:20.680]
They ought to do something about that.

[01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:21.860]
There you go.

[01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:23.040]
Oh, yeah.

[01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:25.180]
Once again, you're right, Neil.

[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:29.660]
I'd have to agree.

[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:32.020]
Yeah.

[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:35.280]
These aren't killing up as fast today as they did that.

[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:37.140]
She must be on slow cookers.

[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:38.620]
I think it's as the ones are on.

[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:40.020]
But why change anything now?

[01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:42.920]
Well, that's not the way I heard it.

[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:44.620]
I have nothing to say.

[01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:45.740]
You're kidding.

[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:46.720]
No.

[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:48.000]
No, that's not right.

[01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:48.720]
Yeah, right.

[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:50.280]
You got it, baby.

[01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:52.080]
Come on, Neil.

[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:53.040]
You know, that's not right.

[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:53.240]
What?

[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:53.720]
Amazing.

[01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:56.800]
Yeah.

[01:47:57.960 --> 01:47:58.500]
What?

[01:47:59.020 --> 01:47:59.280]
Yeah.

[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:01.880]
That's right, Neil.

[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:03.920]
Wait, let's start over.

[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:04.560]
No, no.

[01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:08.140]
Well, you got me there.

[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:09.280]
No way.

[01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:10.160]
Great idea.

[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:11.840]
Oh, my God.

[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:15.660]
I don't think it's legal in the state of Florida.

[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:16.520]
It's true.

[01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:17.980]
Holy cow.

[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:20.180]
They ought to do something about that.

[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:22.380]
Well, I can't say absolutely not.

[01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:24.000]
Once again, you're right, Neil.

[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:25.400]
Yeah.

[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:28.380]
I'd have to agree.

[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:29.660]
There you go.

[01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:30.540]
Oh, yeah.

[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:33.840]
But why change anything now?

[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:37.120]
Well, that's not the way I heard it.

[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:37.960]
You're kidding.

[01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:38.880]
Yeah.

[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:40.200]
No.

[01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:41.540]
No, that's not right.

[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:46.320]
Come on, you know, that's not right.

[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:47.480]
Okay, well, no, no, no.

[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:47.980]
That was okay.

[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:49.820]
But it just, it didn't have the same, uh,

[01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:51.420]
it got to toward the end.

[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:52.180]
It was a little bit.

[01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:54.040]
Yeah, they were picking up just a little bit.

[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:54.420]
They?

[01:48:57.060 --> 01:48:59.080]
The reality is, um, yeah.

[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:02.640]
So anyway, it's 10 till eight.

[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:04.240]
Oh, there it is.

[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:04.780]
Oh, good.

[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:09.040]
Every way we were talking, uh, the other day about best, myer,

[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:09.980]
oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:10.560]
Stop.

[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:11.780]
Oh, yeah, best.

[01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:12.520]
How did a great weekend?

[01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:13.860]
Am I doing this before the break?

[01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:15.440]
Yeah, worked out better last time.

[01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:15.920]
Remember that?

[01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:16.400]
What?

[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:17.160]
Yes.

[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:18.200]
Okay, did this before the break?

[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:18.740]
Okay.

[01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:20.620]
Then we'll talk about best.

[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:21.680]
What a zany morning.

[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:22.020]
Wait a minute.

[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:26.960]
Okay.

[01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:29.840]
Right now, let's talk about the Tastreet Rotisserie,

[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:31.740]
but I have the wrong piece of copy, and that looks like

[01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:32.560]
tropical and cold.

[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:36.960]
So, a lot of fantastic gourmet takeout lunch.

[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:37.820]
Head over to Tropical.

[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:40.500]
And there's this horse in the fifth race.

[01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:43.800]
No, seriously, uh, I want to tell you about Joe and our good

[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:46.000]
friends over at Tastreet Rotisserie because they do this

[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.660]
incredible job of putting together that great gourmet takeout that's

[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:51.480]
keeps you out of the kitchen and keeps you out of those,

[01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:54.540]
some of those restaurants where they do disgusting things in the food

[01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:55.980]
and the soup, you know what I'm talking about.

[01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:57.900]
And it is just incredible.

[01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:58.820]
You've heard us pick out.

[01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:01.920]
Now, the other day Joe brought by that rice pudding that was

[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:05.700]
just loaded with cinnamon and raisins and everything from their

[01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:09.360]
pastas, their hot pastas and pasta salads, and their spit

[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:12.360]
roasted chicken and turkey and all those other good items like

[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:15.980]
that in their desserts are so good that they're almost orgasmic

[01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:16.260]
okay.

[01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:19.820]
And of course federal law prohibits us from expanding on that.

[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:22.160]
But it is really fantastic and you're going to want to get over

[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:26.380]
there real soon or pick up the phone and call them at 437-95-11.

[01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:29.620]
And Joe will send you a list, a whole menu of the great gourmet

[01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:32.600]
takeout items that they have waiting for you at Tastreet Rotisserie.

[01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:35.620]
They're right on the corner of Tapt and Douglas in Pemberg Pines

[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:38.340]
and their open weekdays from 11 in the morning to 8 p.m.

[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:40.060]
and weekends until seven o'clock at night.

[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.380]
So, if you want to save a lot of time and grief in the kitchen,

[01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:44.740]
let the folks do the cooking at Tastreet Rotisserie.

[01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:47.700]
And they also do great catering if you got any kind of special event

[01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:48.120]
coming up.

[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:53.900]
8967 Tastreet in Pemberg Pines and that number again is 437-95-11.

[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:59.660]
A lawyer said Sunday that she remembers overhearing former

[01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:03.660]
Miss America best美ers and tell the judge who presided over her

[01:51:03.660 --> 01:51:09.100]
boyfriends divorce case that a job could be arranged for the judge's daughter.

[01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:09.520]
Ah!

[01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:13.760]
Yeah, the testimony the lawyer Doris Swanner of White Plains

[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:16.340]
could be important to prosecutors in the case against

[01:51:16.340 --> 01:51:20.220]
Myerson, a former City Cultural Affairs Commissioner who was arrested

[01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:22.860]
Friday in Pennsylvania on shoplifting charges.

[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:27.880]
Now, best is 63 years old now and she's charged with giving former Manhattan State Supreme Court

[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:33.900]
justice for Tint's Gables daughter, a 19 thousand dollar a year job in 83

[01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:37.620]
in exchange for the judge's agreement to reduce alimony payments.

[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:41.620]
By Myerson's sweetheart, who was a former City contractor,

[01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:47.400]
Carl Andy Capasso, who is now in jail on tax evasion charges.

[01:51:47.540 --> 01:51:48.400]
Boy, what a family.

[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:49.300]
Did you offer to join a meet coach?

[01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:50.940]
What a family.

[01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:55.460]
There's another happy family, Soul Singer James Brown,

[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.500]
because he loves his wife, but it's time to end his third marriage.

[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:04.020]
The herald journal in Spartanburg, South Carolina,

[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:07.020]
quotes Brown, is saying he wants to be alone.

[01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:10.860]
Brown was arrested in April after allegedly beating his wife,

[01:52:10.860 --> 01:52:14.560]
Adrienne, with a pipe and shooting into her car.

[01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:17.880]
According to the newspaper, Brown says he needs a lot of girls.

[01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:21.900]
The paper says, Brown, he needs a lot of girls.

[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:28.520]
That's what he says, and the paper said James did not say whether he's interested in another woman or not.

[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:32.600]
And we want to say hello to a grand island of Brasco woman,

[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:35.440]
who says one would have been enough.

[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:38.180]
After days were trying to get her new phone from AT&T,

[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:41.540]
she said 21 phones were delivered.

[01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:44.580]
All of them read, and they were all read.

[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:49.720]
And while she likes red, she says she can't use 21 of those phones.

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.520]
What?

[01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:52.320]
You heard me.

[01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:55.700]
Mostly cloudy today, scattered showers and thunderstorms,

[01:52:55.740 --> 01:52:57.860]
50% chance, high mid-80s.

[01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:58.500]
That's right, Neil.

[01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:04.780]
And low to night mid-70s, 73 on Zeta 4 coming up on 754.

[01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:07.280]
Was there a finger in there that I didn't see?

[01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:07.740]
Yeah.

[01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:09.040]
You gave us a finger?

[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:10.400]
Just a zip of the dude.

[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:11.000]
Need that whistle.

[01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:13.280]
You even have to start whistling again.

[01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:14.660]
It's a holiday.

[01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:17.700]
We're on about 22 and a half RPM.

[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:21.060]
You know what else we haven't even started doing yet?

[01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:21.940]
What?

[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:23.740]
Now what did he do at 10 o'clock today?

[01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:25.220]
We haven't.

[01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:26.280]
We haven't programmed.

[01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:28.800]
This is starting to become tedious, don't you think?

[01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:30.780]
Yeah, we shouldn't be doing it on the air,

[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:32.100]
because it takes an awful lot of time.

[01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:33.820]
I could do it in five minutes, myself.

[01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:35.120]
Well, we need you to do it, though.

[01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:37.220]
We need your, you know.

[01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:39.200]
You know there's not even a music sheet in there.

[01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:39.760]
What?

[01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:40.720]
For the rest of the day?

[01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:41.740]
Wait a second.

[01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:45.500]
Hey, this could be the chance of a lifetime.

[01:53:45.580 --> 01:53:47.120]
We could program the whole rest of the day.

[01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:49.240]
Do you imagine?

[01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:51.780]
I was thinking myself, you know, what I heard over the weekend?

[01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:55.060]
On Zeta this, why doesn't the station sound like that all the time?

[01:53:55.260 --> 01:53:56.960]
Now are they still doing the blocks today?

[01:53:57.480 --> 01:53:58.080]
I don't know.

[01:53:58.220 --> 01:53:58.800]
I have no idea.

[01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:00.280]
Does anybody know anything?

[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:02.180]
Hello, maybe we are.

[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:03.500]
Are we doing blocks?

[01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:05.480]
No, come on.

[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:06.140]
Since when?

[01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:06.880]
I don't know.

[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:09.040]
It's a holiday, long holiday week.

[01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:09.580]
Oh, wait a minute.

[01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:14.860]
Is today a rock block party party chip off the old block?

[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:16.440]
We can no repeat.

[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:18.440]
Memorial day.

[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:19.200]
Memorial day.

[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:19.840]
Memorial day.

[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:20.400]
No repeat.

[01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:21.420]
Classic rock.

[01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:22.240]
Hello, Holly.

[01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:22.840]
We can.

[01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:25.480]
It doesn't have to be.

[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:27.560]
You get a free hamburger if you can say it.

[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:29.380]
To be a classic marathon.

[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:30.620]
Here we go.

[01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:31.460]
Here we go.

[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:33.340]
Unscheduled.

[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:34.240]
Unscheduled.

[01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:35.380]
I'm 10 o'clock.

[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:36.140]
I'm 10 o'clock.

[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:36.880]
I was done scheduled.

[01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:38.200]
So I guess we do.

[01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:40.000]
Now we got to get 16 cuts, right?

[01:54:40.220 --> 01:54:40.580]
Oh.

[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:42.200]
16 tons by Ernie Ford.

[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:42.820]
We don't have that.

[01:54:43.980 --> 01:54:45.700]
Okay, let's do a Herman's Hermit's in there.

[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:46.020]
Okay?

[01:54:47.260 --> 01:54:47.620]
Okay.

[01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:48.760]
How about no milk today?

[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:50.940]
My love is gone away.

[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:51.640]
I love that.

[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:51.720]

[01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:53.580]
So I didn't think what you expected like.

[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:54.520]
This is lovely.

[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:56.120]
You've got a brown daughter or one like that.

[01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:56.900]
See, I like that.

[01:54:57.180 --> 01:54:57.540]
Different.

[01:54:57.840 --> 01:54:58.400]
No milk today.

[01:54:58.400 --> 01:54:58.780]
Okay.

[01:54:59.080 --> 01:54:59.580]
Rick Nelson.

[01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:01.140]
Okay.

[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:02.640]
And the traveling man.

[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:05.500]
Now is that one of the songs he used to sing when that show ran short?

[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:08.020]
When they ran short and they had a full of a zee would bring them in.

[01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:10.560]
And they look at the fact that they say that is that this.

[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:12.380]
Now there is something to that, by the way.

[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:15.060]
I'm not totally correct on that, but there is something to that.

[01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:17.200]
How about the Smith and Baby It's You?

[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:18.620]
How about Smith and Wesson?

[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:19.480]
Excellent cut.

[01:55:19.660 --> 01:55:20.680]
Baby It's You by Smith.

[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:22.060]
Oh yeah, that is good.

[01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:23.940]
Haven't heard it in a dog's ex-plan.

[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:24.780]
Pick it in, okay?

[01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:25.300]
Baby!

[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:26.700]
Now that's three.

[01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:27.380]
Yeah.

[01:55:27.380 --> 01:55:29.180]
We control yourself, Cap and Dave.

[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:32.020]
What are you auditioning now for the 10 o'clock hour?

[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:34.060]
Why don't you just sing the 10 o'clock hour, okay?

[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:34.700]
Okay.

[01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:38.360]
All of you are the Raiders on compact disc ladies and gentlemen.

[01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:41.560]
We're not going to play it off those crappy carts that Rose Boulders got in there.

[01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:42.220]
It's scratchy.

[01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:44.680]
And how about just like me?

[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:45.940]
Oh, that's a good one.

[01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:46.480]
All right.

[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:47.240]
You're on a roll.

[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:47.720]
I am.

[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:48.460]
How about Dion?

[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:49.480]
Okay.

[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:51.280]
And how about...

[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:52.380]
Now which one does Cap and Dave?

[01:55:52.580 --> 01:55:54.100]
I mean, Big Dave want to hear off Dion.

[01:55:54.460 --> 01:55:54.640]
Come on.

[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:55.160]
Let's say.

[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:56.120]
Big Dave and Noody.

[01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:56.960]
Dude looks like a lady.

[01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:58.500]
Yeah, dude looks like a lady by deal.

[01:55:58.560 --> 01:55:59.580]
Dude looks like a one.

[01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:00.880]
Now is that the extended mixer?

[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:02.160]
Is that the...

[01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:05.780]
How about Sandy?

[01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:06.940]
Perfect.

[01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:08.260]
I'm familiar with them.

[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:09.400]
No, I'm for that.

[01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:10.320]
I go for that.

[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:11.480]
Well, he likes that name, okay?

[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:12.000]
Yes, I do.

[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:13.780]
That's correct.

[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:16.800]
How about the BGs and Jive talking?

[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:18.000]
That's hip.

[01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:19.360]
That was the number one song, I think.

[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:19.680]
Was it?

[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:21.160]
Was that a big hit or what?

[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:21.340]
Yeah.

[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:22.680]
Jive talking by the BG.

[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:25.140]
So there's a whole bunch off of a whole bunch of...

[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:28.340]
I didn't see these that I bought again with my own little money on Saturday.

[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:29.600]
Okay, that's like five.

[01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:30.960]
Oh, there's got to be more than that.

[01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:32.900]
One, two, three, four, five, six.

[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:34.000]
So we're already...

[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.260]
And it's only 759.

[01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:37.300]
So you can do this in five minutes, if you can.

[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:37.820]
Yeah, really well.

[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.720]
We'll do the rest of all of them now.

[01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:43.720]
Because I have to like, rearrange them in everything, as well as...

[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:44.020]
Why not?

[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:46.200]
Yeah, get some of those...

[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:46.680]
Give me three more.

[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:48.940]
Some of those anthology, yes.

[01:56:48.940 --> 01:56:49.140]
Yes.

[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000]
Took some psychedelic stuff in there.

[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.720]
All right, how about the Marvelettes and Beechwood 45789?

[01:56:56.020 --> 01:56:57.240]
How that is, psychedelic.

[01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:57.720]
Oh, that would be good.

[01:56:57.820 --> 01:56:59.680]
No, that's not psychedelic, but it's a good cut.

[01:57:00.820 --> 01:57:02.300]
You're getting me way behind here now.

[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:03.140]
I've got to do the scores.

[01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:04.180]
Oh, okay.

[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:05.040]
And then we got...

[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:07.460]
See, a pretty full hour here in the eight o'clock hour.

[01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:09.820]
And he's got two live spots logged back to back.

[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:11.440]
That crazy, Eros de Joues.

[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:13.780]
He's got two live spots logged back to back.

[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:15.260]
So we're going to have to do something to straighten that out.

[01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:16.360]
Okay, we'll stop there then.

[01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:19.100]
So in other words, we have a lot of important business to do here.

[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:20.160]
Yeah, we sure do.

[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:22.720]
How about Twist and Shop by the Isley Brothers?

[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:24.460]
Ooh, that's like their best cut.

[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:24.960]
Yeah.

[01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:26.620]
Okay, there's another one for you.

[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:27.280]
Keith and Kyle.

[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:28.220]
Exactly.

[01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:29.200]
The Isley Brothers.

[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.840]
So you're up to like seven or eight now.

[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:32.980]
Give me a break already.

[01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:33.740]
It's eight o'clock.

[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:34.660]
We're a minute late.

[01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:36.280]
Here's the scores real fast.

[01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:36.780]
NBA.

[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:39.680]
It was Dallas 118 LA 104.

[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:41.540]
The Lakers looked like, you know what?

[01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:43.300]
And in the Major League Baseball.

[01:57:43.380 --> 01:57:45.280]
Now, American League Milwaukee, seven Cleveland 2,

[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:47.400]
Toronto 4, Chicago 3, Minnesota 60,

[01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:49.440]
Troy 3, Royals 12, the Rangers 1.

[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:51.220]
Orioles 3, the Angels 2.

[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:52.860]
The Athletics beat the Red Sox 5 to 4.

[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:54.180]
Yankees beat Seattle 7 to 3.

[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:54.800]
National League.

[01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:57.020]
Dodgers 2, Montreal 1, Padre 6.

[01:57:57.140 --> 01:57:59.060]
The Metz 3, Phillies 4, Giants 2.

[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:00.380]
Cardinals beat the Graves 3 to 1.

[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:01.640]
Pirates over the Reds 4 to 2.

[01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:03.320]
Astros beat the Cump 7 to 1.

[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:05.120]
And the Hurricanes run away to Omaha again.

[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:08.860]
They beat the Southwest Texas Basser State last night.

[01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:10.820]
And they're on their way to Omaha.

[01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:15.320]
They won the Atlantic Regional sweeping a field that was just a field of

[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:18.260]
2500 dollar claimers with bandages and all four legs.

[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:21.020]
And that Ron Harrison man, he knows how to get to Omaha.

[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:21.860]
Trust me.

[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:23.220]
I thought they'd beat the hell of a guy.

[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:23.800]
South Carolina.

[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:24.620]
Well, he did.

[01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:27.940]
But what South Carolina is about the only other team that played in that region.

[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:29.620]
The other ones were like a girl schools.

[01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:30.520]
The GameCop.

[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:32.640]
Anyway, you can't say that on this show.

[01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:33.720]
Okay, it's 801.

[01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:35.740]
Now, see, I've gotten so far behind.

[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:36.760]
I don't know what to do with this.

[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:37.640]
You got to do the ID.

[01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:39.620]
Oh, we got to do this request ID.

[01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:40.640]
Okay, go ahead.

[01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:42.860]
This is the Neil Rogers show,

[01:58:42.860 --> 01:58:51.860]
voted by the BCC Caspeteria Club as the worst morning show in radio pro programming.

[01:58:52.580 --> 01:58:56.300]
Programming, history on Zeta.

[01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:57.500]
Zeta.

[01:58:58.640 --> 01:58:58.860]
Zeta.

[01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:01.860]
Zeta 94.9.

[01:59:02.580 --> 01:59:03.480]
Worst.

[01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:05.420]
W Z T A.

[01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:07.280]
W Z T A.

[01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:10.900]
Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and the Palm beaches.

[01:59:10.900 --> 01:59:14.340]
We think Neil is a Dutch bag.

[01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:15.460]
Duce bag.

[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:16.440]
DOOM.

[01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:16.880]
DOOM.

[01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:17.040]

[01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:17.180]
DOOM.

[01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:17.240]
DOOM.

[01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:17.320]

[01:59:17.460 --> 01:59:17.640]
DOOM.

[01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:19.660]
Yeah, right on.

[01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:21.480]
Did I do okay?

[01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:22.220]
Yeah, you did great.

[01:59:22.380 --> 01:59:23.120]
Two minutes after, right.

[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:25.520]
How about we ain't got nothing yet by the Bluesmagoos.

[01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:26.080]
All right.

[01:59:26.260 --> 01:59:26.720]
That's good.

[01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:27.920]
There you go.

[01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:29.740]
We'll fill these out.

[01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:31.160]
The fact you then grant took over.

[01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:31.680]
Okay.

[01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:34.320]
One day you're up and the next day you're there.

[01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:38.600]
That was my favorite line in that.

[01:59:39.660 --> 01:59:42.160]
You can't face the world with your head to the ground.

[01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:45.880]
See, we're putting a little bit of Optimus-type music in this.

[01:59:48.620 --> 01:59:50.920]
Reminds me of a party we had at my house a few weeks ago.

[01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:51.500]
I'm not sick.

[01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:53.240]
You can't face the world with your head to the ground.

[01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:55.680]
Anyway, let's see.

[01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:57.040]
How about, uh,

[01:59:58.480 --> 01:59:59.540]
and we don't want to play that.

[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:00.280]
What's his name?

[02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:00.880]
We'll get all upset.

[02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:02.220]
Gonzer's, he's still working here.

[02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:05.280]
Did we play, uh, keep on dancing on that hour?

[02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:07.820]
Uh, did we do that project we ever did?

[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:08.260]
No.

[02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:09.000]
Well, I'll put it in there.

[02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:10.520]
Keep on dancing by the gentries.

[02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:12.680]
I gotta do that.

[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:14.720]
I gotta just, uh, can we get to that spot?

[02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:16.560]
You know, I heard the show.

[02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:18.100]
I'm stressed with that car.

[02:00:18.220 --> 02:00:20.340]
I heard the hour I was driving to Fort Lauderdale.

[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:21.480]
I was, I'm probably was great.

[02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:22.100]
Yeah, it was.

[02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:22.780]
It was great.

[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:24.640]
I heard most of it driving to Fort Lauderdale.

[02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:27.680]
It takes about 45 minutes to drive to Fort Lauderdale.

[02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:28.860]
And it was excellent.

[02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:29.540]
Priding.

[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:34.600]
I keep on getting more and more.

[02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:35.040]
I'm getting more and more.

[02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:37.020]
Another one of Big Dave's fans.

[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:50.280]
I don't think I went too far.

[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:53.620]
No, it's gonna be a little bit far.

[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:55.960]
Yeah, sometimes, but I used to be in this shocking.

[02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:02.900]
You'd reach over and put a, and then put a, sometimes we'd put a different record would come in after the pause.

[02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:14.200]
I keep on dancing for every modern version of J. Brandt now.

[02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:16.280]
And it's not a shame it's anything.

[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:18.900]
We're gonna show it high.

[02:01:19.180 --> 02:01:20.520]
We're gonna put it in the dark.

[02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:28.400]
You all hear this from the dark car.

[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:29.980]
We're on the Senni Payton show.

[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:44.040]
I keep on dancing.

[02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:47.780]
I keep on dancing for every modern version of J. Brandt now.

[02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:49.040]
And it's back to the beginning.

[02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:50.980]
I never forget the day that I did this accident.

[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:53.380]
And I kept wondering what was going on.

[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:55.980]
And I looked at it was counting down like 155.

[02:01:56.380 --> 02:01:57.740]
The record's only two minutes.

[02:01:57.740 --> 02:01:59.000]
It was really bizarre.

[02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:00.760]
Anyway, that's got a false ending in it.

[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:01.460]
Oh, excuse me.

[02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:07.680]
And the machine, the CD player will put it back to the beginning, which sounds exactly like we're picked up again.

[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:11.280]
The scene you'll try to expand the pause at the end.

[02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:12.560]
Now is this classic rock?

[02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:13.460]
Yeah.

[02:02:13.740 --> 02:02:14.100]
Sure.

[02:02:14.220 --> 02:02:15.140]
This is this classic rock.

[02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:16.120]
Are you serious?

[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:16.740]
No question.

[02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:18.120]
What do you think classic rock is?

[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:21.120]
Now let's get the opinion of somebody under the age of pen over here.

[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:22.880]
What's your definition?

[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:25.320]
Besides...

[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:25.620]
Beatles.

[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:27.940]
I don't know either Beatles.

[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:29.280]
I don't really know the definition.

[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:31.100]
What is the definition of classic rock?

[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:31.960]
Whatever we like.

[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:32.960]
That's right.

[02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:33.700]
That's right.

[02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:35.160]
Whatever they held in the old one.

[02:02:35.580 --> 02:02:37.420]
It's like defining democracy.

[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:39.820]
That's what Rose does.

[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:41.300]
He plays whatever they held he likes.

[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:41.900]
That's right.

[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:42.420]
Right?

[02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:43.600]
Eight million times.

[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:45.920]
I don't know what else we're going to put in there too today.

[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:48.400]
We shall put some obscure Beatles in here.

[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:49.680]
No, we don't want to.

[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:50.360]
We're writing things.

[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:51.640]
Would you know what I mean by obscure?

[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:52.680]
How about sticks?

[02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:56.140]
And too much time on my hands.

[02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:57.080]
That wouldn't be too good.

[02:02:57.080 --> 02:02:57.220]
Okay.

[02:02:58.180 --> 02:02:59.220]
You're going to pick that one?

[02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:00.140]
I'm saying.

[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:01.080]
What's wrong with that?

[02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:01.820]
That's a good song.

[02:03:02.740 --> 02:03:03.220]
You want me to?

[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:05.020]
I mean, there are some good songs on here.

[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:06.600]
But the best of times is great.

[02:03:06.700 --> 02:03:07.240]
Crystal Ball.

[02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:08.340]
I'd really hear that.

[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:09.140]
That one.

[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:09.980]
Okay.

[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:11.140]
We don't care what you'd rather here.

[02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:12.980]
You want to hear some obscure cut that you would like.

[02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:13.480]
That's that obscure.

[02:03:13.700 --> 02:03:13.960]
What?

[02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:15.260]
You didn't even say what it is yet.

[02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:17.480]
The best of times.

[02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:17.780]

[02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:19.160]
What was a blue collar man?

[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:20.400]
Do you remember...

[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:21.000]
Are you two young?

[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.920]
Do you remember blue collar man for like 78?

[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:24.280]
That was a big hit for them.

[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:25.600]
Well, thank God that's not on here.

[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:25.880]
Okay.

[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:27.220]
So just...

[02:03:27.220 --> 02:03:28.240]
So how many we got now?

[02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:30.460]
We must have the whole about 80% of it done.

[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:32.200]
You have a common eyes fight right here.

[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:33.780]
No, don't start counting the 10.

[02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:34.780]
I count the 10.

[02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:35.320]
I count the 11.

[02:03:35.580 --> 02:03:35.860]
11.

[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:36.880]
So we only got...

[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:37.680]
You say 16.

[02:03:37.860 --> 02:03:39.460]
I don't think that's enough because 16 times...

[02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:39.740]
That's right.

[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:40.060]
He always says that.

[02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:42.600]
Every two and a half is 32, is 40 minutes.

[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:43.360]
He went 18.

[02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:44.440]
I think 18.

[02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:44.860]
I think 18.

[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:46.100]
19 to be on the safe side.

[02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:46.300]

[02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:46.480]
Okay.

[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:47.720]
Mostly cloudy today.

[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:51.440]
We do have a 50% chance of scattered showers and thunderstorms again.

[02:03:51.580 --> 02:03:52.720]
It'll be in the mid 80s.

[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:55.160]
And tonight mostly cloudy with a low in the mid 70s.

[02:03:55.460 --> 02:03:57.740]
73 degrees this morning at Zeta 4.

[02:03:57.960 --> 02:03:59.620]
It's almost seven after eight.

[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:00.940]
It's eight or nine on Zeta 4.

[02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:02.400]
The near Rogers Memorial Day show.

[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:03.580]
Listen, what can I do?

[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:04.560]
Don't play must for the weather.

[02:04:04.740 --> 02:04:07.760]
It's dripping down here in Carroll City and it's gray and dank.

[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:09.000]
And it looks like hell on wheels.

[02:04:09.060 --> 02:04:10.400]
But that's where it goes.

[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:11.320]
You have to be creative.

[02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:11.720]
Yeah.

[02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:12.540]
Right?

[02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:13.560]
Get it out of the way.

[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:17.460]
Like, you know, bring everybody inside and cook those weenies on the stove or something.

[02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:17.660]
Right?

[02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:19.060]
Sounds good to me.

[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:19.800]
I bet it does.

[02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:24.280]
So anyway, it's nine after eight and we're going to take another couple of calls and we've got all the stuff backed up.

[02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:25.340]
Do you want to finish this thing?

[02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:27.960]
First, if you want to.

[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:30.360]
You seem to be in a major hurry for this today.

[02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:31.620]
You seem to be apple-plugged.

[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:32.120]
No, no, no.

[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:33.500]
We got two hours.

[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:37.100]
I was just thinking I've got to like write down what order it's in and know.

[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:39.400]
Because you guys never want to share in that part.

[02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:40.600]
Well, we don't want to.

[02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:42.640]
We pick them and you place them.

[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:43.320]
How's that?

[02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:45.180]
Sort of like horse races.

[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:45.600]

[02:04:46.580 --> 02:04:47.360]
Well, let's see.

[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:51.400]
I'm looking at some of these CDs are really pretty limited, you know?

[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:51.920]
I know.

[02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:53.580]
You can get some stuff out of here.

[02:04:54.060 --> 02:04:55.640]
Sweet little 16 by Chuck Berry.

[02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:56.700]
Fine.

[02:04:56.940 --> 02:04:58.080]
Yeah, we never do rock and roll record.

[02:04:58.080 --> 02:04:59.160]
We never do much Chuck Berry.

[02:04:59.360 --> 02:04:59.800]
I know, probably.

[02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:02.920]
It belongs even the station once in a great while by accident plays little Chuck Berry.

[02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:03.980]
Sweet little 16.

[02:05:04.220 --> 02:05:05.740]
And the CD hits the wrong cut.

[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:06.160]

[02:05:06.340 --> 02:05:06.560]
Yeah.

[02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:08.440]
How about the little Richard too?

[02:05:08.840 --> 02:05:11.980]
If I can find one, everybody keeps talking to me with little Richard and I know.

[02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:13.480]
There's some on there because I've played it.

[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:14.360]
Oh, have you really?

[02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:18.940]
You know, also what you got there that I like is Junior Walker in the All Star.

[02:05:18.940 --> 02:05:19.380]
Oh, yeah.

[02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:23.460]
Like a road runner or something would be your, you know, one of his big hits.

[02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:24.500]
That sounds really good.

[02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:25.600]
You think I can find it?

[02:05:25.780 --> 02:05:26.000]
Yeah.

[02:05:26.460 --> 02:05:27.180]
You want to play it?

[02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:27.840]
Played, say it.

[02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:31.740]
Why I played it on Zeta last, that was on last night.

[02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:32.820]
Ask Anisha, fine.

[02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:33.580]
Junior Walker.

[02:05:33.580 --> 02:05:34.260]
Junior Walker.

[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:35.340]
How about shotgun?

[02:05:35.860 --> 02:05:36.080]
Great.

[02:05:36.100 --> 02:05:36.900]
Oh, that's a good one.

[02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:37.660]
That's excellent.

[02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:40.100]
Yeah, Junior Walker in the All Stars and shotgun.

[02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:40.860]
Great.

[02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:41.180]

[02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:41.840]
That's a big and big.

[02:05:44.460 --> 02:05:45.520]
It's 11 after 8.

[02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:48.680]
I don't know why we're giving the time a lot this morning because nobody in their right mind has to work.

[02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:49.620]
It's good to have schooled or anything.

[02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:51.160]
So forget about the time already.

[02:05:51.420 --> 02:05:51.820]
Just relax.

[02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:55.440]
Take a load off your button.

[02:05:55.580 --> 02:05:56.080]
Just relax.

[02:05:57.820 --> 02:05:58.220]
Okay.

[02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:00.440]
How about a whole lot of shaking going on by Jerry Lee Lewis?

[02:06:01.180 --> 02:06:01.400]
Yeah.

[02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:03.340]
I like that.

[02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:03.940]
Jerry Lee.

[02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:04.480]
A lot.

[02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:05.660]
Yeah, and it's a real up record.

[02:06:05.660 --> 02:06:07.980]
So would fit in there after some stiff that we put in.

[02:06:08.900 --> 02:06:09.740]
That would be good.

[02:06:09.740 --> 02:06:11.720]
See, this isn't really all that hard.

[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:13.640]
Yeah, it sounds real good when you play that.

[02:06:13.640 --> 02:06:16.300]
I have to listen to this on the way home to this hour.

[02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:16.860]
Can we turn?

[02:06:17.020 --> 02:06:19.800]
Oh, now you're supposed to be getting into all this old music.

[02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:21.520]
You're the one who keeps punching out magical.

[02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:23.360]
How about the night Chicago die?

[02:06:23.660 --> 02:06:30.040]
Yeah, see, now that's good to listen to him because I didn't notice you guys always lean toward like 59, 60, 60,

[02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:30.780]
or wrong.

[02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:31.900]
These are not 59.

[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:32.640]
Okay.

[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:34.640]
What, now what have we given him so far?

[02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:35.260]
He or so.

[02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:35.860]
Okay.

[02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:37.780]
Perfect example.

[02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:40.640]
This one on some days, it's more extreme than other.

[02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:41.700]
You got traveling man.

[02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:44.360]
You got Twisted Shell.

[02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:45.540]
Travel man is about 62, okay?

[02:06:45.620 --> 02:06:46.600]
Okay, Twisted Shell.

[02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:48.300]
Yeah, 63, I would say.

[02:06:48.380 --> 02:06:49.160]
Keep on dancing.

[02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:50.980]
That's 68 or 9.

[02:06:51.620 --> 02:06:53.160]
More like 65 or 6.

[02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:53.960]
Keep on dancing.

[02:06:54.220 --> 02:06:55.960]
It's sweet little 16 shot.

[02:06:56.160 --> 02:06:57.120]
No, no, no, wait a minute.

[02:06:57.180 --> 02:06:58.100]
This isn't too bad.

[02:06:58.520 --> 02:06:59.180]
Okay, wait a minute.

[02:06:59.560 --> 02:07:00.400]
Well, we have a content.

[02:07:00.580 --> 02:07:02.160]
I say keep on dancing.

[02:07:02.860 --> 02:07:04.580]
65 and a whole lot of shaking.

[02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:05.900]
And you say 68.

[02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:07.060]
No way it's 68.

[02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:07.600]
Okay.

[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:09.040]
Well, let's take a look.

[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:10.880]
We can take it off with a whole lot of shaking.

[02:07:10.900 --> 02:07:12.780]
Gentries, 925, 65.

[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:14.380]
The bird finally hit him.

[02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:15.980]
Right arm.

[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:16.800]
Right arm.

[02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:18.240]
Yeah, you had the right ear too.

[02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:19.440]
You had to try to put it out.

[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:20.300]
Forget who you're dealing with.

[02:07:20.460 --> 02:07:21.280]
I know, I try.

[02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:24.520]
There's no Johnny Dark, but yeah.

[02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:29.780]
Oh, I saw a TV show that had a Johnny Dark in it.

[02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:30.660]
Oh, the comedian?

[02:07:30.940 --> 02:07:33.140]
Yeah, as the announcer of a wrestling match.

[02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:34.820]
Like a burnout old guy.

[02:07:34.860 --> 02:07:35.920]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:38.520]
Yeah, that's the fake Johnny Dark.

[02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:40.780]
Now, we deal here with the real Johnny Dark.

[02:07:40.860 --> 02:07:42.460]
It was funny, see, his name won this thing.

[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:45.500]
Yeah, he gets confused with him all the time.

[02:07:45.580 --> 02:07:47.180]
People used to call him up in New York and say,

[02:07:47.180 --> 02:07:48.940]
I saw you a nerve last night.

[02:07:49.980 --> 02:07:51.440]
No, no, no.

[02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:53.440]
So, let's wrap this up.

[02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:54.920]
You guys want to start with a whole lot of shaking?

[02:07:55.420 --> 02:07:56.240]
Yeah, how many you got?

[02:07:56.660 --> 02:07:58.240]
About 14, 13.

[02:07:58.440 --> 02:08:01.280]
How about Nelt and John and they're okay just to make you a contemporary?

[02:08:01.700 --> 02:08:01.800]
Yeah.

[02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:03.040]
Something a little more contemporary.

[02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:07.100]
Like, but not too new, like fill it off your freedom.

[02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:08.280]
That's a good one.

[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:09.500]
Good day for that, don't you think?

[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:09.620]
Yeah.

[02:08:09.620 --> 02:08:10.840]
That should be the second song.

[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:11.880]
That's good on Memorial Day.

[02:08:11.960 --> 02:08:13.220]
A little fill it off your freedom, right?

[02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:14.140]
Something real corny.

[02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:15.240]
And that's, see, that's long.

[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:16.240]
That's like five minutes.

[02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:19.540]
We have a ballad of the green beret on a record that year.

[02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:20.840]
That's good for Memorial Day.

[02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:24.460]
How about express weight of your heart by the soul survivors?

[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:26.320]
And then you play that Friday?

[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:27.240]
No.

[02:08:27.460 --> 02:08:28.520]
No, I didn't play that since.

[02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:30.080]
No, I didn't play that at all at hour.

[02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:30.700]
Are you sure?

[02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:31.700]
No, no, no.

[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:32.640]
All right.

[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:34.340]
I bet my Bush gun, okay?

[02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:36.060]
I bet my left arm.

[02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:39.260]
Back cap and Dave.

[02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:40.560]
He's something else, isn't he?

[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:40.920]
Inny?

[02:08:41.340 --> 02:08:41.640]
Okay.

[02:08:41.700 --> 02:08:43.600]
How about surf and safari by the beach boys?

[02:08:43.620 --> 02:08:44.680]
Now you're getting hip.

[02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:45.500]
See, that's different.

[02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:46.080]
Yeah.

[02:08:46.220 --> 02:08:46.740]
Something different.

[02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:47.380]
I like it.

[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:48.480]
It's on there.

[02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:50.240]
So look at this pile we got here, man.

[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:51.120]
That's a pile.

[02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:55.560]
And then two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen.

[02:08:55.700 --> 02:08:56.480]
It's a pile of something.

[02:08:56.600 --> 02:08:57.060]
I'll send you there.

[02:08:57.120 --> 02:08:58.140]
One is five minutes.

[02:08:58.520 --> 02:08:59.180]
That's good enough.

[02:08:59.180 --> 02:09:01.500]
So can we get by on sixteen or you want to do it?

[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:03.520]
Yeah, but I was thinking we'd get out of here a little early today.

[02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:03.920]
Okay.

[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:05.540]
You think of that?

[02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:06.380]
Yeah, that's a good idea.

[02:09:06.380 --> 02:09:07.360]
That wasn't till now.

[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:08.120]
Like five minutes.

[02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:08.580]

[02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:10.640]
So you want to add a couple more backups?

[02:09:11.140 --> 02:09:11.320]
Yeah.

[02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:12.700]
And I know you hate this.

[02:09:12.860 --> 02:09:13.380]
I don't know why.

[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:14.980]
You don't like Jim Croci at all, do you?

[02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:15.780]
Yes, I do.

[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:16.920]
Some of it.

[02:09:17.180 --> 02:09:20.460]
See, I got Jim Croci out because I worked in AC for two years.

[02:09:20.460 --> 02:09:21.320]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:23.020]
Yeah, that's exactly right.

[02:09:23.100 --> 02:09:23.740]
Exactly right.

[02:09:23.860 --> 02:09:24.580]
I used to love him.

[02:09:24.660 --> 02:09:26.320]
How about Rapid Roy, the stock car boy?

[02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:26.820]
I like that.

[02:09:26.820 --> 02:09:29.820]
I remember the ice-flat in the country station.

[02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:31.360]
Or you don't mess around with Jim?

[02:09:31.420 --> 02:09:33.280]
I'd be appropriate for the Daytona 500.

[02:09:33.620 --> 02:09:33.960]
What's that?

[02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:35.660]
The Rapid Roy, the stock car boy.

[02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:38.060]
See, I like operator, but that's two mellow for us.

[02:09:38.300 --> 02:09:39.220]
We would never play the love.

[02:09:39.780 --> 02:09:40.180]
Two Glovey.

[02:09:40.420 --> 02:09:41.880]
Yeah, real Glovey.

[02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:42.740]
Two Glovey, dubby.

[02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:43.220]
Yeah.

[02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:46.000]
And you need to play something they can't play.

[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:48.740]
Well, so how about Rapid Roy, the stock car boy?

[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:49.480]
I don't know that one.

[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:50.660]
We already put you what?

[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:51.740]
I don't know that one.

[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:53.440]
Oh, geez.

[02:09:53.700 --> 02:09:54.440]
Here we go again.

[02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:54.940]
So the book.

[02:09:54.940 --> 02:09:56.740]
No, I'm not going to the book.

[02:09:56.760 --> 02:09:57.660]
I'm going to go to the Michigan book.

[02:09:57.660 --> 02:09:58.880]
Cut, it's not in the book.

[02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:00.560]
Yeah, I don't need to go to the book.

[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:01.700]
It's not there.

[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:06.560]
You challenge me.

[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:07.220]
What?

[02:10:07.220 --> 02:10:07.300]
What?

[02:10:07.660 --> 02:10:07.660]

[02:10:07.660 --> 02:10:08.140]
I'm mungering.

[02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:10.000]
He hits one by luck.

[02:10:10.220 --> 02:10:11.140]
Right away, he's there.

[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:13.220]
Right away, he thinks he's...

[02:10:13.220 --> 02:10:14.860]
I think he's right on this one, too.

[02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:15.460]
Wow.

[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:16.880]
But now if I get two today.

[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:18.640]
I think he's Casey Kasim or something.

[02:10:18.820 --> 02:10:19.800]
I get to go home.

[02:10:21.420 --> 02:10:22.220]
Jim Croci.

[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:24.280]
What was the name of it again?

[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:25.420]
Rapid Roy.

[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:26.860]
Roy Boy or something.

[02:10:27.300 --> 02:10:28.400]
Stock car guy.

[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:29.860]
Not there, isn't it?

[02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:30.760]
Well, it didn't quite make it.

[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:32.580]
So now that's two.

[02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:34.580]
All right, but let's see if you heard of it.

[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:35.100]
That's a big time.

[02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:35.940]
I never heard of it.

[02:10:35.940 --> 02:10:36.200]
I never heard of it.

[02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:36.640]
I never heard of it.

[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:38.660]
It's like Ro saying it ever heard of Little Honda.

[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:40.440]
It is not the same.

[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:41.820]
It is not the same.

[02:10:41.820 --> 02:10:42.140]
It is not.

[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:42.420]
It is not.

[02:10:42.420 --> 02:10:43.140]
There is a single mission.

[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:47.820]
This is like KISS.

[02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:50.660]
Oh, Rapid Roy, that's not car 4.

[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:52.440]
He too much to believe.

[02:10:52.900 --> 02:10:53.560]
Nice record.

[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:56.040]
I remember this.

[02:10:57.920 --> 02:10:59.800]
I never heard this.

[02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:02.800]
I don't want to play hit.

[02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:03.680]
It's in this hour.

[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:06.880]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:09.640]
We used to play this on the country stage.

[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:10.580]
I'm happy.

[02:11:11.060 --> 02:11:12.320]
That's not car 4.

[02:11:12.580 --> 02:11:13.160]
He don't bill.

[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:15.880]
Okay, see the reason I noticed, because I've had this album forever.

[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:17.260]
And I listened to the whole thing.

[02:11:17.260 --> 02:11:18.640]
So I know it like it was a hit.

[02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:20.340]
Let's forget Jim Croci.

[02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:24.580]
Let's just leave him home.

[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:25.000]
Okay.

[02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:27.500]
Because he's not feeling well these days.

[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:29.420]
He's spinning in his stomach.

[02:11:29.420 --> 02:11:30.440]
He's got an acedron headache.

[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:33.600]
Okay, well, the guess who is always good for a cut?

[02:11:33.700 --> 02:11:36.700]
And of course they have so many good ones that now no sugar and I

[02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:37.700]
isn't going to make it today.

[02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:39.060]
No, any other one though.

[02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:42.480]
But I don't know how about star baby.

[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:43.120]
Great.

[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:44.560]
I love star baby.

[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:45.640]
It's short, but it's a great record.

[02:11:45.780 --> 02:11:46.300]
I love that record.

[02:11:46.300 --> 02:11:47.100]
Okay, that should be enough.

[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:48.760]
And then of course, if there's any time left over,

[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:50.140]
he can stick in one of those dissonance.

[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:53.500]
And then he's going to be a star baby.

[02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:53.500]

[02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:53.560]
And then he's going to be a star baby.

[02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:54.400]
And then he's going to be a star baby.

[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:56.620]
And then he's going to be a star baby.

[02:11:56.620 --> 02:11:57.680]
And then he's going to be a star baby.

[02:11:57.800 --> 02:11:58.980]
And then he's going to be a star baby.

[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.840]
And then he's going to be a star baby.

[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:03.580]
And then he's going to be a star baby.

[02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:05.500]
And then he's going to be a star baby.

[02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:07.960]
And then he's going to be a star baby.

[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:10.380]
And then he's going to be a star baby.

[02:12:10.380 --> 02:12:11.880]
And then he's going to be a star baby.

[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:14.500]
And then he's going to be a star baby.

[02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:15.180]
And then he's going to be a star baby.

[02:12:15.420 --> 02:12:16.580]
And then he's going to be a star baby.

[02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:20.120]
And then he's going to be a star baby.

[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:20.760]
Good morning.

[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:21.740]
How are you doing today?

[02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:22.660]
OK, how are you doing?

[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.080]
Good, hey, whatever happened with that thing

[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:26.840]
with Steve Tyler and Danny Eng.

[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:28.400]
Whatever happened to it?

[02:12:28.420 --> 02:12:30.360]
Oh, Steve never heard what the result was.

[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:33.020]
Steve Tyler, when there was so much lack of interest

[02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:35.060]
in that poll that day that it was frightening.

[02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:36.820]
But Steve Tyler won by a hair.

[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:38.380]
Oh, great.

[02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:40.420]
So he noticed the Steve's got a little more hair

[02:12:40.420 --> 02:12:41.640]
than Danny Eng these days.

[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:43.620]
In fact, after another few days,

[02:12:43.740 --> 02:12:45.880]
Danny's blond hairs are going to be turning gray.

[02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:49.580]
Hey, I like your new bed for the news.

[02:12:49.580 --> 02:12:50.900]
The Duke of Mass.

[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:52.320]
Isn't that great?

[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:53.520]
Yeah, yeah, enjoy.

[02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:55.580]
I get burned out on that other one.

[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:56.720]
Yeah, in fact, in about 930,

[02:12:56.720 --> 02:12:57.980]
we're going to say Mass for the Duke.

[02:12:58.300 --> 02:13:00.440]
Hey, how about the bucks, though?

[02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:03.080]
They're starting to put things together.

[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:04.180]
Yeah, I don't know what's going on.

[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:05.560]
And then the bunny is going crazy

[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:07.140]
and there are only three and a half games out.

[02:13:07.140 --> 02:13:08.000]
And it's frightening.

[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.060]
But the meds look pretty lackluster.

[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:11.940]
They had that big move on the road there.

[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:13.080]
They looked like world beaters.

[02:13:13.420 --> 02:13:15.740]
And they came home and they looked like they've had it.

[02:13:15.980 --> 02:13:17.720]
Yeah, I think everybody kind of

[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:20.920]
go through a little bit during the season

[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:22.980]
where they start falling apart and all that.

[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:23.880]
Yeah, I like the braves.

[02:13:23.940 --> 02:13:24.620]
They're all reals, yeah.

[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:27.880]
Hey, that's a little bit of a reday thing with those guys.

[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:30.220]
But you know this Chuck Tanner,

[02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:31.040]
now that he's gone there,

[02:13:31.140 --> 02:13:32.320]
actually, they've won a few games.

[02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:33.740]
Oral victory for the braves.

[02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:34.220]
That's correct.

[02:13:34.540 --> 02:13:36.740]
Okay, well, you have a good day today.

[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:37.280]
You too.

[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:37.920]
Okay, bye.

[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:38.420]
What boy?

[02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:40.320]
It's late at night.

[02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:41.420]
You're all fast asleep

[02:13:41.420 --> 02:13:44.440]
and a shadowy figure is about to break into your home.

[02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:46.260]
But you're protected.

[02:13:46.260 --> 02:13:48.740]
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:52.240]
Yeah, it's the James Brown home security alarm.

[02:13:52.740 --> 02:13:54.340]
Ow, ow, ow.

[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:57.220]
The heart is working alarm in the safety business.

[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:00.300]
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

[02:14:00.300 --> 02:14:01.340]
Oh, yeah.

[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:04.260]
Designed by the godfather of home protection himself.

[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:06.300]
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:10.040]
The James Brown alarm protects you from burglar,

[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:12.540]
pipvandals, pipvandals, pipvandals.

[02:14:12.740 --> 02:14:13.300]
Pipvandals.

[02:14:13.380 --> 02:14:14.260]
And if you act now,

[02:14:14.260 --> 02:14:16.160]
we'll include it no extra cause.

[02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:19.760]
The patented James Brown hot pants far along.

[02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:21.120]
Ow, ow, ow.

[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:25.000]
So put the soul patrol on your keyhole.

[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:26.240]
Ow, ow.

[02:14:26.300 --> 02:14:29.120]
With a James Brown home security system.

[02:14:29.460 --> 02:14:30.840]
Ow, ow.

[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:31.940]
You'll save.

[02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:32.840]
I'll be a good.

[02:14:33.340 --> 02:14:34.040]
Ow, ow.

[02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:38.180]
It is kind of reassuring to have Captain Day back here kicking the chair.

[02:14:38.540 --> 02:14:38.780]
And, no.

[02:14:39.100 --> 02:14:40.780]
Is he doing back there?

[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:42.340]
What is this man going to receive?

[02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:44.560]
He's so animated, yeah.

[02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:46.280]
I know what is it.

[02:14:46.300 --> 02:14:46.860]
It's just that.
