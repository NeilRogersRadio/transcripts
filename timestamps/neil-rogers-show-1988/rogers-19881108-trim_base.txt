[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.840]
like crackers just fell out of that all over the table

[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.400]
everything that's really strange okay now let me give the numbers on and we're

[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.600]
gonna take it easy today we're not gonna be under all that pressure like yesterday

[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.040]
and everybody i talked to said they really enjoyed the show but i just

[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.800]
felt like i was going about a mile a minute i don't know why but it was all

[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.220]
these we were taking a break like every two seconds

[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.400]
weren't we yeah well let's gonna say a break for longer than the show that was

[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.520]
the incredible part but then again we got all these political stuff like i said

[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.940]
and that's gonna go away we'll slowly get it together and do it one day

[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.600]
we'll intimidate them and tell them you know to cut this crap out

[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.420]
anyway let me give you the numbers now even though already all but the Palm

[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.300]
Beach line are lit and there's something about you idiots up in Palm Beach

[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.560]
okay when we were on on data and even when we were on winds remember in the

[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.680]

[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.460]

to Palm Beach line and yesterday thank god the lines were going crazy all day

[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.420]
and the only exception a couple of times we had a tweak Palm Beach a little bit

[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.460]
and believe me there are a lot of people up there who haven't been tweaked in a

[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.600]
long time i think that's their problem especially in Lake Worth okay but i'm

[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.820]
gonna give you all the numbers because we don't want all the chronic AM

[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.380]

what they're voting for this is merit retention of district court of appeals

[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.920]
judges they have no opponents running against them their names merely appear on

[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.660]
the ballot and there's been no information as to what they have been doing on

[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.960]
the bench for the last eight or ten years and which they've been making hundreds

[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.820]
of rulings people are not them voters are not them and they want to know what

[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:41.000]
they're voting on merit retention is in fact reappointment for life it is an

[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.520]

[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.920]
all these heavy topics about two years ago and there's no point in trying to

[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.660]

[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.860]
okay 1035 everything just going along so well isn't it you just waiting for that one big

[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.340]
desperate explosion okay April Wortham's got a news update and we'll come back in a flash on

[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:05.380]
610 WIO did you know what I just discovered what I've been cranking up the headphone level which is what

[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:12.140]
no instead of the telephone level for the colors on the overhead and that's why he's saying the

[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:16.240]
phone levels are so low they are a little bit low but I've been cranking up the wrong pot

[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.720]
and that's why this is worked so well just like sitting on there it's been bouncing off the table

[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:28.760]
anyway it's 1039 21 to 11 on 610 WIO D and our next cool is from Miami hello yeah Neil

[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:35.540]
does the bird ever talk why does the bird ever say anything no he just cackles sir he gets paid by

[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:44.360]
the cackle okay let's go to um what would he like I don't know lottery hello hello sir yes sir

[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:50.000]
I'm glad to hear you back on the AM thank you sir and I'm glad that they are going to let

[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.760]
you break loose and do your job and do it well yeah they're just oblivious here they just

[00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.000]
anything we want to do they just go ahead and do it and uh mine your own business so I've been

[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.580]
reading the articles and they said that basically you can do what you want as long as it's

[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:10.920]
when within the FCC rule that is correct well can you tell me what did the other station tell you

[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:15.940]
you couldn't do uh anything other than hello and goodbye that those were the limits anything

[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:21.760]
outside of that and maybe an occasional how you're doing but other than that sir there wasn't a

[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.340]
hell of a lot left for us to do well what was the reason of pulling my boyfriend's back in that

[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:30.960]
incredible now listen I want you to understand a Portland main mentality with the one of the uh

[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:36.380]
corporate executive douchebags from Portland came down one day and heard it on the air and he felt

[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:45.120]
that it was promoting homosexuality okay well what's for a lottery what well I mean let's hang

[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:50.820]
on sir don't go that to mere cocks okay because you get very upset yeah that's true but I was

[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.940]
amazed you know listening to it yesterday that they would pull that it is even the local even the

[00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:01.180]
local management and even the local management uh was embarrassed by that but again you see when

[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.780]
these Yahoo's from Portland main every time they'd come down they hear something or a group of

[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.560]
things that they didn't like and go ahead and pull a card out you can't do that you know and it

[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.360]
just got to the point where it was ridiculous because they've got no sense of humor they're

[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.840]
terminally not just homophobic they're like sexophobic like they're all uniques up there or

[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.880]
something yeah yeah just uh they believe that sex is not a part of anybody's life and that even

[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.780]
satire about it is just uh verboten you know and I used to start cranking up the microwave and

[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:31.380]
getting all hysterical and uh but just couldn't be done so what about JetBoy Jet Girl I've heard

[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.780]
worse things than other songs yeah there's nothing wrong with it says something about having a good

[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:40.240]
head on your shoulders or something like that and it's harmless exactly and the other weird thing

[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.640]
was that the records they played the rest of the day said much worse things oh yeah they still

[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.560]
play they still play records that it got some of the seven band words yeah one the other night I

[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.240]
heard that Steve Miller band record that's at the SH and you know right and they claim that they

[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.320]
don't play it but they do when he heard it with your own three years you know so they just have a

[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.220]
real conflict over there in the that whole company is just run by a bunch of Neanderthals from

[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:06.300]
Portland and uh you know the amazing part of it is when we were on AM a year ago

[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.140]
that we would have meetings and they'd say hey that fine we're behind you there's no problem with

[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:16.420]
this and no problem with this no that's not they didn't figure nobody was listening we had a nine

[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:21.220]
share but the point is then these people from Maine started coming down some of the corporate

[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:27.080]
teeth bags and and everything they hurt nervous breaks out okay so um that's the bottom line yeah

[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.920]
and I can't believe that data still letting day waste on my lifetime deal with that

[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:36.560]
yeah well I'm not going to say anything about that because I like to even do a great job for us

[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.700]
but but the fact is when you leave a bunch of your stuff behind for them to start playing it is

[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:46.240]
tacky I mean we played some of the old breakfast club stuff but it was done as satire was done as a

[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.160]
joke we weren't using it for serious in fact if you heard any of it it wasn't joke okay but um

[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.880]
I don't know I just delighted we're both tickled with that to be out of there and it was a real

[00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.100]
the last few months there were the most depressing thing and I remember that to me the day that broke

[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:05.000]
my back was it hey I came back from that great vacation in Hawaii my great vacation and here was

[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.720]
a stan had been blown away and here was the program director waiting for me at the airport

[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.780]
and he had all of these memos and you can't say that you can't talk about stan and you can't talk

[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.000]
about the a m and blah blah blah blah blah and that was like the beginning the end for me I just got

[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.440]
worse from there both stands a great guy and he's a good talent but great show I mean I still

[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.620]
listen and he had great numbers and great demographics but again they don't relate to success when

[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:31.440]
you do well they get very nervous yeah are you gonna like let me oh you're gonna let Ed call in

[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.920]
or is Neil gonna like stop them it will call in very briefly okay sir oh come on very briefly

[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:41.600]
that is that's an excellent have a wonderful day sir okay let's go to this hate call for the

[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:47.700]
bird on five I can't wait for this hello yeah yeah you know what I'm gonna ask you Neil yeah I'm

[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:54.840]
gonna ask you right is on there with you I mean Jeff Charles should be on there with you Jeff Charles

[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.100]
Jeff Charles was on his station filling in for one day and they dragged him out of here kicking

[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:05.460]
and screaming okay first Charles is out of his mind sir Jeff Charles said here and promoted drug

[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:10.480]
use for four hours one day okay you wanted that's his opinion yeah that's his opinion to come on

[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:16.160]
here and promote use of drugs that's his opinion if you want to hear Jeff Charles move to Rowan

[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.940]
Ocoke because I think that's where he's gonna show I don't appreciate being put in the

[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:25.640]
care of the Jeff Charles Ray Charles maybe but not Jeff Charles I don't appreciate it this is

[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.980]
gonna work out because it's 10.44 and I promised that kid yesterday and I'm gonna win him is 20 bucks

[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.940]
okay 10.55 sometimes when we go away do you get the feeling like we're never coming back do you

[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:40.640]
ever get that feeling wow anyway the nice talking to you we'll be back right after the news

[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:46.660]
a just a little joke okay let's go to Miami next hello hello Neil yes sir yeah I disagree with

that since it's election day I always wondered where you found them well that's under a rock in

[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:03.820]
Nashville that's a weird story I've never been to Nashville any the reason I called Neil

[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:09.760]
I'm a morning drive person yeah and I know you'd like to watch the numbers you're rating numbers

[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:17.120]
if you can get some statistics on accident I predict there's gonna be a increase in accident on the

[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.880]
road people not getting their morning laugh with you they're gonna be taken out their anxieties

[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.680]
and wrecking into each other well that's good that'll make the insurance rates go up and to make

[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.820]
the insurance companies happy and probably get a lot of business that's great so who are we what

[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:35.820]

[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:29.280]
morning and now they all they want us back in the morning we don't want to be on in the morning

[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.660]
okay we're sick and tired of that crap yeah we don't want to get up at 4 30 in the morning coming

[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:39.160]
and pretend to be happy and awake and alert in all that garbage the hell with that stuff we did

[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.860]
pretty good at pretending yeah we put on a good act as all a big lie okay we hated every thinking

[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:48.600]
minute of it anyway don't forget Henry Barrow has got a special election wrap up hour tonight

[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:53.440]
from 10 to 11 on WIOD so if you want to get depressed tune in here that now he is going to be very

[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.180]
depressing because we know that Bush is going to win and anybody with an IQ over two is going to be

[00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:02.320]
upset about that yeah and as far as McKay and Mack are concerned is anybody going to be happy

[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:08.540]
regardless I mean you know forget it that's just a desperate situation anyway news up coming at

[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:14.160]
the top of the hour we'll come back with our number two at 1105 here on 610 WIOD thank you so

[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:19.980]
much 1106 and WIOD and here we are ladies and gentlemen with our picks of the day this could be

[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:24.420]
the beginning of a gigantic no seriously there could be some people on there would be retiring by

[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:29.200]
the end of the week the birds picked today in the seventh race and he always picks these chalk

[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.940]
you know he's like three to five and cramp like that whirling rainbow with Gera in a seventh race

[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:40.260]
which is picked in fact it's the best bet by Slater in a herald yeah and everybody picks it

[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.760]
on top anybody can pick five to two in a morning line okay my pick in the eighth race because I

[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:51.680]
like the name of the horse cold spot cold spot yeah you're interesting with Rodriguez that's yeah

[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:56.860]
I have a cold spot this morning eight to one in a morning line so there could be some serious

[00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:02.860]
uh bucks made on that one if it comes in is anybody pick it and now look at this Slater I didn't

[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:08.720]
even see this Slater Streeva in the racing form all pick cold spot really can sense his pick on top

[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.660]
but it's eight to one in the morning line so I'm trying to pick a price and I wind up with

[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:17.720]
something everybody picks well you know mine they they're coming number one are they scratched

[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.500]

[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.940]

wiod let's go to Miami hello well new yes sir I've been listening to you since your wmwm

[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:13.180]
that stage and you know it amazes me I always are able to land on your feet somewhere else you

[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:18.160]
yeah just like a cat just like a cat like you were on the cat too I remember yeah I was on the cat

[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:24.300]
and you remember that yeah sure I was be only 27 but I've been listening to you since I was eight

[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:33.860]
what yeah okay that's your arithmetic whatever you say pal but anyway this is the first time I'm

[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:40.980]
going to vote and do I dare ask who you're voting for I actually I call to see if you can give me

[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:46.960]
a suggestion because it's still up in the air for me I don't know I'm I'm taking along a dime I think

[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:53.060]
I'm gonna flip the coin really up to a last moment I'm sure I'm a Republican yeah register as a

[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:58.760]
let me ask you this question at any time during a campaign did you really hear Bush discuss anything

[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:04.120]
about any issue he talked about the pledge of allegiance he talked about he talked about will

[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:09.020]
he hoorten a lot in about the furloughs and he talked about the liberals and he used all kinds

[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:14.600]
of labels and words and and he never once really addressed the issue he never talked sensibly

[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.940]
about where he's gonna you know cut the budget he never talked about anything really of any

[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:23.680]
substance about the elderly about the homeless about any of the issues about the drug situation

[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.540]
been in charge of the drug thing for last day years and it's been a disaster but how could anybody

[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:33.120]
of good conscience vote for Bush really yeah well then I know he's gonna sweep the state of Florida

[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.520]
but how could they do it but the caucus into that much of this no I disagree with you do

[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.780]
cock it wait a minute do caucus ran a bad campaign but at least he was talking the issues okay see

[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:47.060]
that's his problem he and his advisors didn't understand how done the American public are and

[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.720]
you know that you really have to deal with all this extraneous crap they try to talk issues

[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:56.360]
and that was their mistake well I got to admit Bush played a dirty yeah and yeah the caucus and

[00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.640]
the caucus tried to keep up with it and if you want to clear conscience here because you asked

[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.920]
me vote for new caucus because it's not gonna make any difference in Florida anyway but at least

[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:08.500]
then you won't be able to say three four years down the road that nobody can blame you okay yeah well

[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.320]
I just well okay I'll take your word for it now listen you're gonna do whatever you want but

[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:18.640]
you asked me for a suggestion that's the way I feel about Bush did talk about the whales yeah

[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.660]
you didn't make the whales a couple of guys meant that okay he ran a whale of a campaign they're not

[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:31.140]
they're not at the uh uh they're not at my priority but okay I'll try and uh they're really not

[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:35.900]
okay you're serious good luck to you thank you okay I hope you have a clean conscience all right

[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:40.120]

okay well um i would really like to apologize um to the american people about the

[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:12.480]
the or english amendment that the people the group of my Spanish people were

[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:20.060]
atollia against what do you mean you want to apologize for what well for the group of Spanish

[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:25.200]
people who don't want that amendment passed for their own selfish reasons yeah well let me just

[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.980]
say this to you the last thing in the world that i want to do again is bilingualism i know sandy

[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:34.760]
likes to do that two or three times a week but i did more shows on bilingualism in the early part of

[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.960]
the eighties in this town and you can shake a stick at and the bottom line is that people who want to

[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.340]
be a part of the country are going to go ahead and they're going to do it and people that want to

[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:47.000]
use a language as a weapon are good no matter how many laws you pass they're still going to be rude

[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.600]
and they're still going to be arrogant and they're still going to do it and it it doesn't make any

[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:57.140]
difference how many laws you pass i know no i realize that but i i blame it most of the other um

[00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:03.400]
high-position people that are here they're Spanish like the media that they run the media

[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:08.840]
and the radio stations they you know they're terribly biased and in the info is or East people

[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:14.460]
we can turn out i consider them stupid in a sense because you know if we consider ourselves

[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:19.940]
patriotic like we do what we come on when we become American citizens we should really do

[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:25.380]
a spec for this nation and if it's a common track that is heard from nation because you know

[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:32.280]
nation that's separated by languages becomes weaker you know we shouldn't not allow that and the thing

[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:36.720]
is when i hear the radio stations in Spanish i'm only listening to it now because normally i

[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:41.520]
will listen to english and that's really what they don't want yeah they want to come on east to come

[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:45.900]
on east to come on east to etc to help with fidel yeah i appreciate it we accept your apology

[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:51.120]
wasn't really necessary but your sentiments are our decent and uh we thank you really all

[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:57.400]

[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:59.240]
of decided about the caucus or bush i was about five hundred yards from that when it happened i

[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:04.900]
remember digging people out of there seeing the things the bad thing i remember right afterwards

[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:10.600]
the french people sent a contingent one of their guys from back in france came out i don't

[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:16.180]

[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:22.040]
talked to them prayed with them stayed with them helped with the cause uh

[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:30.340]

[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:04.500]
ducks over there as a you know allegedly a peacekeeping force where there hasn't been any peace for five

[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:09.640]

[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:17.720]
okay thanks a lot yeah good bye boy that was depressing but it was true you know but uh you know

[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:22.740]
that's not our thing okay it's not our thing because unfortunately in this country in this vast

[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:30.160]
wasteland of intellectual uh neanderthaleness if there's such a word it's a hopeless situation okay

[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.520]
really is to try to appeal to the american people with facts or with the any kind of meaningful

[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:38.660]
dialogue you're wasting your time man they want a brawl they want everything to be a fistfight

[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:42.780]
like that heraldos show i guarantee you when that show airs and whatever date is when he gets

[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:47.480]
his nose broken giant ratings it's gonna have like an eighty share okay did you see money tea last

[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:52.180]
night no but the big bandages on that uh they should have a bandage like all around his head okay

[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:56.940]
like a mummy like the invisible man pro 19 to w io d let's not get too modeling here let's go to

[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:02.780]
line sixes of mobile pro huh yep yep yep how do you feel about being on the same station as Steve

[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:07.440]
came because uh you know you two have had words together i remember when you were on nine forty

[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:13.760]
a.m. Steve came would say that you were a liability to the station because of you know that

[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:20.500]
advertising liability and uh he made other remarks as i remember that you don't have a guts to talk

[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:25.380]
to him in person and of course you've had words about him that i've heard that's a business sir

[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:30.840]
that's a way it goes yeah yeah so that he was all untrue that was all i thought sir do you want

[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:36.000]
an answer to the question or not yeah what i said was not on true i don't say things for dramatic

[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.340]
purposes okay i say things because i believe them but the business is such that it necessitates you

[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:45.260]
i mean you're you know you're always going to wind up working with people that you had run ins with

[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:50.120]
in the past especially when you do a controversial talk it's the nature of the business okay yeah

[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:54.980]
right okay and Steve's gonna do his thing and i'm gonna do my thing and so far man we're not gonna

[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:59.600]
go and we're getting along great and you know if you're a pro you got to do those things okay that

[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:04.260]
doesn't mean i'm gonna uh you know go out on the town with him and Rick every night but that's

[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:08.940]
one of those things all right thanks a lot okay yeah i think there are a lot of people in the audience

[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:12.960]
they need to get that out of their system okay i mean right away you become a hypocrite and you

[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:18.040]
become you know your credibility is shot that's a lot of baloney okay you do what you've got to do

[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.800]
and when people come along and they give you an opportunity like to get out of jail practically

[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:26.980]
which is how we felt at the other station and they give you the kind of deals that they made with us

[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:32.600]
you just don't say no unless you're crazy yeah okay and didn't i go through that thing about uh

[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:37.020]
all of us in radio and tv being a little bit on the your hurry side then i mentioned that earlier

[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:41.220]
in the show but none of that means that we're not gonna continue to stop talk about our pal Steve

[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:47.060]
of course like uh every day i get in love for George Bush he knows better than that he knows

[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.460]
there isn't any way in the world that he ought to be voting for George Bush but because i'm for

[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:55.440]
New Caucus he of course and also the influence of his good buddy Rick uh he's for Bush he's out

[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:00.780]
of his mind to be for Bush and these people that say well i'm scared to death a quail but i'm still

[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:06.280]
gonna vote for but what logic is there in that when we've had as many presidents die or be

[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:11.420]
assassinated or be uh have to resign like Nixon whatever the hell happened and all of a sudden the

[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:16.120]
vice president takes over and you wipe up with a dummy like a Gerald Ford for example good example

[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:21.560]
could walk to gum or brushes teeth at the same time excellent example yeah well that's just what

[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:25.440]
we need right and the amazing part of his Dan quail makes sure it makes uh

[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:32.100]
jury Ford seem like a brain you know okay so what does that tell you but i'm not gonna let that

[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:36.900]

the car you had over there we able to take those back with you with a yours there well not the ACN

[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:27.580]
stuff that's all you know they pay for that so American comedy network is out but you know we're

[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:32.260]
just commenting during the last break that the stuff that we used to play on AM almost all of

[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:36.720]
which is over here now is the stuff that really people were excited about and the ACN was like

[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.340]
you know frosting on a cake but most of it wasn't all that exciting okay well I'm glad you're

[01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:45.980]
on AM and AM go a new look thanks a lot okay take it easy boy boy and that's what it's like seven six

[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:51.680]
and it's something at least it's exciting got a lot of people that were dragging back to AM because

[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:55.740]
let's face it with the exception of GTR which is over here right next door and they give a

[01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:59.660]
re-upset if I didn't say that but no they're doing great they have a gigantic number and they got

[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:04.200]
the great demographics and they're doing fantastic but I mean generally speaking AF and I know

[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.500]
the scientific critical I say wow when it was on FM he you know said AM was dead and it was it

[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:14.020]

[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:23.340]
they've improved it a little bit you know like once in a while here and you know you hear a

[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:29.220]
couple of letters but for months there was like you know you couldn't even hear it and there

[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:33.280]

[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:03.960]
news for you gonna hear that every day I am so happy I really mean that I mean you know like I

[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:08.620]
call you up once as they did and I said Neil the show doesn't that good and I was being serious I

[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:14.420]
said Neil the show doesn't sound the same and I guess you just couldn't tell the truth well no I

[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:18.100]
used to I used to animate that how many times did I go on and scream about the fact that we're

[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:21.540]
being humiliated and degraded and muzzled and bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap

[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:26.240]
you didn't do that all the time but you can only go so far if you want to keep getting a paycheck you know

[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:31.080]
I did this like three months before you came out of the closet so to speak on that particular

[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:37.540]
subject and I thought maybe it was just me and it wasn't because the show really started to

[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:42.360]
degenerate and now let me tell you something and I really owe an apology but again it's not my fault

[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:49.900]
because it's the restrictions they've placed on us six weeks eight weeks I was coasting isn't the

[01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:53.680]
word but I was like vegetating I mean we go in there in the morning and we sit around and look at

[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:58.340]
each other like you know are we ready to blow our brains out what do we do today what can we say I

[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:02.760]
mean when they take away 90% of your material man how the hell do you do a radio show it's true

[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.120]
because I have to say this you know when you went over and made the shift the first thing I did

[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:12.080]
was go out and buy myself one of these radios that worked in the shower because I was so

[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:17.800]
addicted during the 10 to 2 slots I didn't want to miss anything and that lasted for a couple of

[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:22.660]
months and then all of a sudden it says you know what am I doing I'm waiting for my time yeah

[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:30.040]
Pembroke Pine hello hey Bill how you doing great yeah it's great to hear you back on the A and

[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:33.360]
that Steve came to be cutting the lady off there it's one of the funniest things I've heard come from

[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:38.600]
and I've never really gotten to listen to him too much I'm I'm number seven on the A.M. conversion list for you

[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:43.740]
all right let's hear another one yeah it's great having gotten to listen to A.M. probably since I was

[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:48.960]
15 years old back when the gold or was yeah but I got a question it's one of these things that

[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.760]
you get kind of curious and you just want to know and now like I say I haven't gotten to listen

[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:56.560]
to the other A.M. guys that much but I've been listening to Reneerie a little and a little bit of

[01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:01.240]
Steve Cain is just does Mike Reneerie does he just slobber all over the mic when he's talking yeah that's

[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:05.540]
what it sounds like yeah it sounds like he's double-toned well you know when you got one finger way up

[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:10.580]
but you just the leaning kind of the other nostril on the edge of the mic it's a very delicate balance

[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:15.600]
and he does it incredibly well he really does he does a good job but I've touched this one thing

[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:21.240]
I was curious about I'm a speech therapist so it kind of hit me as funny it just sounded like he's

[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:25.020]
just hitting all over the place I'll wait a minute what did you say oh you're a speech therapist

[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:29.320]
I thought you said you were Steve's therapist well I've tried that too because if you were

[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:32.500]
Steve's therapist after the performance you just put on it here with that picture man

[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:37.960]
I'm in a lot of trouble no I'll never have Steve on my couch thank you okay but great to hear you

[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:42.360]
back in the same with the bird good to hear you bird thank you sir okay thank you all boy okay

[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:47.320]
yeah Steve was an interesting guy 21 till 2 is that the worst you want to use

[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:53.380]
W-I-O-D and we'll go to Miami hello how you doing pal all right how's it going hey right hi

[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:59.540]
I was really shocked two weeks ago I left for Vegas for a while I'd come back and you guys switched

[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:04.220]
over on me yeah we sure did boy we got out we broke out in the middle of night yeah we waited till

[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:07.780]
you were out of town though yeah I was gonna call you but I just couldn't stay until two

[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:12.040]
o'clock or four o'clock in the morning he was just too hard to do right first of all I've never

[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:15.880]
heard you on the A and before so it was my first time for that great so in other words you're like

[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:20.300]
you're like number eight number eight great I listen to you guys like about eight or nine months on the FM

[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:25.980]
and I think you guys do sound a little bit over here great yeah well we feel better that helps a lot

[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:30.800]
you know I buy all I want to say congratulations to switching over and good luck you guys thanks

[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:38.360]
a lot a heap all right adios bye bye I'll read the dirage why is Larry King say that one four

[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:43.620]
three one four three and of course Larry I'll be on here exclusively on W-I-O-D

[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:48.960]
tonight because he's a great American and he'll be right on after Henry Barrow and that special

[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:55.900]
10 to 11 hour election night oh man it's gonna be like indigestion isn't it that probably you

[01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:59.500]
can feel it already in fact by 10 o'clock Henry will be in a position to like wrap up all the other

[01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:05.020]
because I have a feeling that by 7 30 all three networks are going to take any little bit of fun

[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:10.360]
and any little tiny hope you know the polls were like narrowing like the last NBC poll was only five

[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:15.800]
points and a last CBS poll was down to six points and this morning Harris came out with a poll

[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:21.940]
it was only four points wow and a margin of error is like plus and minus three so yeah so if you're

[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:25.600]
really want to get into that school of swishful thinking I mean it's possible it could be within a

[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.300]
couple of points either way and it really would all depend on who turned out but the problem is

[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:33.960]
then you look at the electoral college and you just say hey who the hell are we kidding you know

[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:39.000]
just it's a country of Yahoo's and Rednecks and good luck to us all okay all right both I think

[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.540]
is on eight and what the Palm Beach line hello hello Neil yeah great first time caller here good
