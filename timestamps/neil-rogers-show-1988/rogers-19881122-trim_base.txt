[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.940]
first things I ever heard was over

[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.200]
on the other station was this

[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.680]
terrible it was I believe it was a

[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.920]
legal ID for W I and C and it sounds

[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.040]
like oh oh yeah that's about kicking

[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.620]
ass no no that was Dave Graveline did

[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.260]
that you would happen to have that

[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.720]
which is what I have it I'll tell you

[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.160]
one thing I give anything if I did

[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.420]
have it but the program director

[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.060]
over there's got it closeted away

[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.100]
it's spirited away in a deep dark

[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.680]
place I really I'd be very happy to

[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.000]
help him put a lot of other things at a

[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.260]
deep dark place to you know what I'm

[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.340]
saying starting with that foot

[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.680]
exactly but just keep up the good work

[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.440]
have a great thanks okay you too

[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.760]
thank you bye bye you know it's

[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.940]
interesting that thing that Graveline

[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.380]
did that we we just found it sitting

[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.700]
on a cabinet yeah I don't know if they

[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.780]
used to sit kicking ass you never

[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.360]
heard us play that I played the hell

[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.940]
out of it see one thing that I always

[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.660]
have learned is if you find something

[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.420]
that they might get nervous about

[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.160]
play the crap out of it and then

[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.740]
you know later on if they come in and

[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.880]
take it at least you've milked for

[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.800]
everything you can get yeah here it's

[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.080]
different speaking of playing the

[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.560]
crap out of it there he is just get

[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.800]
out of our lives and have a wonderful

[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.800]
life anyway what was I saying so

[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.140]
anyway we get this great thing that

[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.300]
we find on a cabinet no and it was

[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.980]
like kick it as fifty thousand

[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.020]

[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.960]
here they're trying with this all

[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.200]
news and it was funny yeah and we

[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.840]
played the daylights out of it for

[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.100]
about two or three days and then the

[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.800]
rose called me in as usual you know

[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.680]
like come on let's go talk and that

[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.840]

didn't have a sense of humor oh my

[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.840]
which I know comes out of the

[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.840]
great shock oh really is that

[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.380]
incredible we had to pull it you

[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.480]
would have liked it because it said

[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.080]
even in the homies he's the only

[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.560]
guy I've ever worked for who has

[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.420]
been embarrassed to tell me about

[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.840]
my ratings because they were so

[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.220]

[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.920]
before you came and it was the day

[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.880]
and you know how he used to sit at

[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.020]
the computer we're talking about the

[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.520]
program director sit at the computer

[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.880]
and get all the numbers and give them

[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.160]
out and everything run all around

[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.320]
a building like a chicken with this

[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.300]
head cut off and I'm sitting

[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.600]
there and I'm saying okay where are

[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.540]
they because we knew we were going to

[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.340]
have a good book because we were

[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.460]
following the trends and I think

[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.920]
we had had about a seven something

[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.760]
I had had a seven in the winter

[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.460]
book and now the spring book was

[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.880]
coming out we had a seven nine or

[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.100]
an eight or something in the trend

[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.060]
so we know it's going to be a good

[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.600]
book that was the book we got a

[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.440]
nine year and we had a practically

[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.680]
pounded this guy in a head to get

[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.800]
him to turn loose with the numbers

[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.760]
yeah that's what a douchebag he is

[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.760]
oh I'm sure he was hostile oh I'm

[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.380]
sure he was with their with their

[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.960]
great numbers now their twos and

[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.540]
their ones and he's been out

[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.600]
really all news man all snooze

[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.640]
I'll have a take toward mediocrity

[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.180]
trust him okay let's go to a

[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.360]
lottery hello hey Neil how's it going

[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.060]

[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.800]
this is a real treat that stand on

[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.120]
there today I just want you to know

[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.080]
I wrote a letter and I called and I

[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.880]
you know told them well if they took

[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.860]
you off the market that was it I

[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.900]
wasn't going to listen to the B.I.N.

[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.480]
Finn I've never turned the back on my

[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.080]
dial I have you I haven't I haven't

[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.080]
you have a lot of company to your

[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.480]
trust me out they just doing the

[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.500]
same thing I mean well after you

[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.280]
left Neil they lost I think after

[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.380]
you know advertising anyway yeah they

[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.720]
lost quite a few mm-hmm but especially

[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.560]
since that new guy's on there I mean

[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.600]
you know music fine you can turn it

[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.400]
on listen to it all the time between

[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.620]
commercial from the FM but you know

[00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.120]
you had something really good going

[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.320]
there and they blew that too they

[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.240]
would have if they would have been

[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.520]
smarts they that they would have had

[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.920]
you on and then had to think if I

[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.300]
could tell you how many times I had

[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.860]
that conversation with a big

[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.920]
guy that I think I got there I can't

[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.100]
stand to listen to him he's like a

[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.620]
sick Joey Reynolds you know well

[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.920]
here's the just think of this man

[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.940]
here is a manager who had an

[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.820]
opportunity to have the number one

[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.860]
rated radio station in this market

[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.280]
by simply putting me on following

[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.220]
Neil that's right that's all they had

[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.740]
to do they would have automatically

[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.560]
been number one in this market and

[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.000]
they chose not to do that you know

[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]
they want to be don't forget you're

[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.280]
forgetting they want to be number three

[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.360]
yeah they don't want to be number ten

[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.060]
I think they want to be twelve actually

[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.360]
or twenty three years later whatever

[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.540]
last one is they got a death wish

[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.880]
that for sure you got it and I

[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.260]
notice even put a muscle on days now

[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.080]
really yeah you know when I haven't

[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.480]
been listening to him that much anymore

[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.580]
since uh... month well suggested a

[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.300]
right but uh... he you know he's not

[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.720]
allowed hardly to say anything well good

[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.580]
like to him yeah well maybe I'll put two

[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.420]
three more people on the morning show

[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.960]
nobody to be able to say that they can

[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.480]
to all talk at the same time like we're

[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.920]
doing anyway you'll be able to understand

[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.020]
any of it so they can't get any trouble

[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.480]
i guess i have a good one uh... you know

[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.360]
good luck to you on uh... good luck on your

[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.260]
diet you can eat over Thanksgiving or not

[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.780]
no i'm sure not i'm going to do just what

[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.900]
i'm supposed to do that

[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.820]
that's great you're giving your given me

[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.740]
encouragement to do it too well you do it

[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.700]
it's gonna be great okay thanks a lot

[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.540]
i'll go on

[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.920]
i don't know if uh... a lot of people may have

[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.400]
forgotten

[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.220]
but last summer when you were on midday

[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.480]
you and i were on midday stand

[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.340]
followed us in the afternoon we were the

[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.900]
number one real radio station in south

[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.900]
florida yeah i had a six four behind only

[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.460]
life and qp a station at a six four incredible

[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.400]
demographics are kicking ass all over the

[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.980]
place and then and then you see the first

[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.500]
big mistake in this is where i disagree with you

[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.080]
all would help me tremendously because in

[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.520]
terms of income it helped a lot uh... getting

[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.600]
off the a m going on to f m and then coming

[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.320]
back here but um... they when they started

[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.680]
messing up the a m yeah without any

[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.400]
regard as to what would happen to it

[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.080]
and then they stuck jay and there and i like jay jays a good guy but jay is not

[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.800]
a talk show host and he's ever gonna be

[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.460]
it's a great and that thing that he was doing here in midday that you had a

[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.700]
follow by the way every day got i mean you couldn't define it

[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.020]
got a lot of what i want to let the cat out of the bag and just say one thing

[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.600]
about what they told me when they quote let me go

[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.900]
yeah you know you mongest check and let me go

[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.640]
they did pay me up until september first which was right to your contract

[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.280]
uh...

[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.960]
they said they said and you have to think about this argument

[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.880]
for a little bit and then it'll finally get to you

[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:41.260]
they said that the reason they had to take my program off which was number one

[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.780]
was because they couldn't find anybody to precede me to replace you

[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.560]
yeah sure so think about that

[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.300]
no is that was the excuse for dumping the number one show in the afternoon

[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.180]
is because they couldn't find anybody to do ten to two

[00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.960]
well first of all a logical thing would have been and we talked about this

[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.240]
often for them to put you on midday

[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.100]
tend to two so that people who listen to me in morning on fm

[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.220]
would have then turned right over to you i mean a lot of people who saw that

[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.360]
who were an even radio people was just obvious right and then an afternoon

[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.240]
drive they could have fun somebody do to do after you drive where they could have

[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.100]
gone back to do a new accident what difference does it make right

[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.740]
but uh... don't confuse them with the facts man one thing i learned about them

[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.380]
over the four and a half years i worked there's anything that makes sense

[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.020]
they will never do it now and uh... that can be said again

[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.620]
one forty nine and w.i.o.d will come right back in a few more calls in with stand

[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.940]
