oh

[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.440]
do you think there's some correlation

[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.360]
between him giving us food

[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.900]

[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.940]
disappearing midnight melodies

[00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.880]
did we play something called midnight melodies

[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.800]
no i have a note from uh... normand can't the attorney

[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.380]
up in brown and just a note yeah i know normand two just a note to share with you how much i enjoyed my monday morning drive the court

[00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.980]
listening to something you call midnight melodies

[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.340]
just keep up the bastardly deeds

[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.740]
midnight is that mean

[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.660]
midnight melodies

[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.980]
i wonder how many people want me to put together that thing

[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.820]
you know i was thinking about that my favorites

[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.540]
are from the uh... early fifties through the eighties and do a whole show on that

[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.380]
realize how much money it would cost me to go out and buy all that music

[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.240]
because i'm thinking our library

[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.680]
i just don't think that we probably have like green door by gym low

[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.300]
sure we do

[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.120]
and here is on zeta four

[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.680]
we have some surprises in store today

[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.880]
hey

[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.980]
because uh... denis fold your roses not going to be in today okay roses are going to be away from the weekend

[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.100]
and the rumor is

[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.880]
as i was told last night

[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.500]
that rose and the gary laran's are executive vice president and general manager and all around uh...

[00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.080]
fascist sympathizer uh... that they may be actually traveling somewhere this morning in the vehicle okay now probably not this early

[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.180]
but maybe a little bit later in larth's vehicle you mean

[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.440]
in some of these i don't know does it make a difference whose vehicle it is

[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.640]
i don't understand what you're saying the vehicle

[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.380]
oh

[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.620]
maybe ed can help us out okay

[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.320]
ed

[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.400]
somebody turned a damn power off on his machine

[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.500]
you don't even have an ed

[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.040]
how was that possible somebody's been in here again

[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.700]
so

[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.640]
i don't know if you can

[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.040]
put up with that but i guess if you really want to listen to this tape you're going to have to

[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.620]
i know

[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.980]
i know and now listen we started this tape 24 hours ago ladies and gentlemen

[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.480]
this is a tape that was said to us by the marvelous gentleman up in fort lauderdale

[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.440]
it had all these great bits on it that we were going to maybe play on the year and some we couldn't play

[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.000]
and uh... we've been sampling it for 24 second hours and ed is still talking

[00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.980]
it's the intro i can't get he's still doing the talk up

[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.480]
he's at acn b2

[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.400]
in the history of broadcasting even rich sure has never done a 24 hour talk up ladies and gentlemen

[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.640]
we have not gotten to the first bit

[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.980]
it is incredible no

[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.520]
i can't believe it can you believe your very ears

[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.820]
i tell you if you miss the first part of the show you really

[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.720]
in fact several people told me i was really surprised that they heard that routine and it was

[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.080]
hysterical if not intended to be funny in the least bit

[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.520]
but my favorite you know my favorite hour of the show is the first hour always because you know some

[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.260]
mornings you and i are like asleep i mean it's just speak for yourself would you please

[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.180]
one morning my feathered friend one morning you and i were asleep let me change that one morning you and i were out of it

[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.740]
what's amazing i'm out of it every morning but i would say that

[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.340]
i wish by the way i wish this uh... this wacko over on the beach would stop sending me these stupid cards and letters

[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.900]
with a printing about uh...

[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.600]
jesus superstar virgin mary omega moon new eight you know all they do is go right in a waste

[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.860]
basket i have no idea why he's wasting all that money

[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.880]
you know what mid and look at here's another one

[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.860]
tom hidey hidey or hidey or something like that

[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.520]
what what what are you looking for

[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.060]
and i hope that guy shows up to cut my hair today right now i climb cut yesterday

[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.320]
did you and that great and uh big day needs his hair cut too he is here only because we have that other car coming later on

[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.220]
and going to have two cars to drive out of here and that was not an easy accomplishment i can assure you now

[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.620]
you have another car coming here just one for a week at Tiffany

[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.440]
if you see nose you know but you do need another car it's true

[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.800]
oh absolutely i'm glad you got seven days in a week and that'll make it right

[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.200]
that's right so if there's anybody out there's got like a nine twenty eight s or something like that

[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.340]
that they want to let me uh... you know drive around for a year or so we'd be delighted

[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:57.220]
you have another five yeah another car coming okay all right well you know i'm crazy i'm weird i just

[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:04.680]
want one car i know you did have two for a while there let's not get back into that oh that's not unless you want to

[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.500]
if he ever comes back in here i think you'll have an apology and me talk to you that was not you spoke to him about it already

[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.200]
yeah and he didn't know what i was talking about he's uh... sound asleep it's three minutes till six on zeta four

[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.260]
now let's give those numbers out it's a Friday morning and i would suggest if you're listening to the show in a car right now any kind of a vehicle

[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.260]
uh... we're doing our own little survey here in fact we hired away the program director from y 100 that 10-year-old kid

[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:38.880]
and he's out there counting headlights so turn on those headlights flash him real nice now and uh... that'll indicate to everybody around you that you're listening to zeta four okay

[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.680]
that spot that they are running is the most insipid stupid thing if you stopped and really thought about what it says

[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:55.060]
oh yeah now they won't play the same record twice in an hour i think that you know that's not what he says he says you won't hear the same song every hour

[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:03.300]
now what does that mean can you explain that to me means what i just said that they won't play the same song twice in one hour that's what it means but that's not what he

[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:11.860]
are you following this i know he says we won't play the same song every hour that's what it means

[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:27.780]
yeah now you are aware that this entire series of spots you know they're sequels right they ask for your input then they come back and you know they've taken your input now here's what they're going to do

[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:37.640]
WZTA Miami Beach Fort Lauderdale in the Palm Beach is it's 558 yes well these were all done at the beginning that's what my point is these were all done at the beginning

[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:46.300]
they were all done at one time you are aware of that speaking of what nothing did you have an idea there yeah that's okay

[00:06:49.360 --> 00:07:00.320]
okay be moody and all that kind of stuff i can't help it i was going to let you play it are you sure now later okay oh that's good now he's turning his own pot down

[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.620]
do you hear that that sounded really good are you going to talk into that mic that's up on the ceiling there or what

[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:13.640]
now now we're going to make a pledge to okay we're not going to play the same song twice in one hour okay you think rose

[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.420]
forger is already in the car with our fascist sympathizer general manager we can only five 59

[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:30.820]
okay now let me ask you a question when it gets to be like six o'clock like a couple of seconds afterward would that be not playing the same song twice in the same hour

[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:38.760]
absolutely correct you absolutely got see that's what they're going to do kids in y100 they're going to play like Michael Jackson some real

[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:44.080]
wimpy Michael Jackson record about four minutes of the hour and then they'll come on with some big ID you know

[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.020]
a whole big song of dance and then they'll play it again at like a minute after the hour also you can have

[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:55.260]
cap and Dave do his big ID here yeah and that's a good idea and then you can play it right after it

[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.960]
but maybe i should play because it it is kind of what you're talking is it good well it's it's an air

[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.260]
check that we got from y100 i think so all great let's hear that i can't wait

[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:15.560]
getting near the time of the hour with funny socks on zeta 4 wzta miniviche for a lot of the farm

[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:22.080]
vices radio station where we don't say the same thing every five minutes we get into it right

[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.600]
funny yeah i just hear you say that we don't say the same thing every five minutes what was that i

[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.840]
said did i just hear you say that we don't say the same thing every five minutes you wrong brain

[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:37.380]
you just broke the rule sure dead i got it funny one go let's go let's go

[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.280]
we got it funny size on zeta 4

[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.720]
well it's six o'clock on wzta miniviche for water the the pop beaches

[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.940]
well i just thought i better say it because i don't know if mumbling the ID makes it

[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:05.860]
does that make it legal or not i it's true okay anyway here we are let me give those numbers out

[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.840]
because i know the audience is going to be responding with a frenzy today don't you think oh yeah

[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.340]
you think so no doubt there's no question and a figure i was listening big david's here okay

[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.820]
oh great just mention that in passing his mic is on the ceiling but he is actually here

[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.880]
i'm sure you'll call and he's not making any maneuverers to try to lower it so that

[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.620]
indicates something to me i mean indicates he's asleep i think he is asleep i'll tell you what

[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.340]
i think i deserve some kind of an award for actually rousing you leave it out of the sack and

[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.820]
getting him in here to well he's thrilled to be here about but i must tell you the the worst part

[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.060]
of the whole deal was i had to listen to him singing to all the songs that were playing this

[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:44.580]
morning on the way to work which was a punishment far worse than death exactly wait does that

[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.760]
mic work now that's your own mic by the way i know i never this is this is pretty interesting does

[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:53.640]
it seem like it's fading out or something that's like the phone calls this doesn't work either what's

[00:09:53.640 --> 00:10:00.640]
it doesn't this level we can't hear it at all well how about now this is work yeah well he said

[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:08.600]
it's sad i just blew days how about now does it work now big days okay that's good i can

[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:14.560]
say it works great i really a little bit too good probably anyway it's a 602 on zeta 4 now listen

[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:20.860]
Monday when you with Monday somebody said to me Sally i saw Sally yesterday and you know what she

[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:25.960]
said to me about you she said lately you've gotten just back to your old self again you just

[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:31.640]
cackling up a storm and while i told you're getting paid by the cackle that's when she understood it

[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:37.660]
well i can't say absolutely not yeah and uh you're just out of control again i don't know what the

[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.960]
hell has happened maybe it's all the food that came in this week but anyway Monday morning at 830

[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:48.280]
and this could be the beginning of a series of swimsuit contests uh Cooper city high allegedly the

[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.360]
seniors are having a skip day on Monday that's the rumor and we can get some verification on that

[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.860]
before the show is over and they're going to be out here in front of the window perading around

[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:02.060]
in their bathing suits young ladies and men young men and ladies and some who are kind of like in

[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:06.480]
between and we're going to judge and we'll come up with something we'll find some albums or CDs

[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:13.440]
or something to give away yeah we got some prizes do we yeah how about some of those old pink

[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.480]

squeeze too okay at 603 and here are those numbers that you've been waiting for in date county

[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.020]
now it is interesting that they're already like four lines lit up which is pretty good right

[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:31.540]
mm-hmm but i do remember back on a m do you remember the days when lines used to flash without

[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:36.000]
the numbers just automatically and we would just punch them up every day and then somebody came

[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.920]
along and started doing a screenless thursday which i thought was an incredibly original idea

[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:50.860]
in the date county 620 3600 that 620 3600 and it bowered 7779 3600 now what do we need to

[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:56.580]
wake the audience up this morning okay and you notice he is nowhere to be found again he's

[00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:02.500]
reverted back to his old tricks he's scrounging for food in the lobby now he really is tell me more

[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:08.340]
about selling what do you want to know what she said about she said that you have been cackling

why not head for shells for delicious shellfish in great pasta and that shrimp pasta is so good

[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:21.500]
that it's absolutely unbelievable i mean it is just delicious and shells is not a fancy shmancy

[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.840]
place with tuxedos and fancy waiters and all that other kind of garbage it's a very informal laid back

[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.040]
place take the whole family in there the kids can cry and make them big scene and everybody can

[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.940]

[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.320]
one of the judges and he's threatened to come by around eight thirty which means he doesn't have

[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.540]
to get up at four thirty in the morning to be here and I thought we'd all just kind of sit here

[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.620]
inside an ogle and ogle because when they can't see us and we can see then there's something

[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.020]
voyeuristic I know they can't see you through that window but your Jimmy Swaggart would like to be

[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:59.760]
your judge too huh I got a couple of bibs you know but you know what they say judge not less

[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.640]
DB judge isn't that what they say yeah that's right that's what the Lord said the big day

[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.700]
prefers you know getting up at four thirty I'm telling you you better do the weather okay because

[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.980]
we don't have time to mess around today okay you already did it remember I said I always

[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:19.320]
swear you said it's 72 but you didn't say it 607 on Zeta 4 we do that's incredible it's a

[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:24.720]
six oh nine I'm Zeta 4 that really is shocking to be honest with you it is you stole it from a

[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.660]
who's stolen who got that I stole something from the lawyer's office yeah no I don't think I

[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:33.780]
stole anything okay now what what have you got there is that something important oh I was just

[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:39.520]
reading this nice ladies letter and I like the stationery says I'm 40 at the top and at the

[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:44.940]
bottom and damn proud of it talking on the air with a mouthful of food also known as pig radio

[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:50.140]
doesn't make it just as it doesn't make it off the air you're cackling sidekick who cackles at

[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:54.540]
everything whether it's funny or not doesn't make it being rude to callers who may not be quite

[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:59.420]
as interesting as you'd like doesn't make it calling the cacklers reading from the life section

[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:04.520]
of USA today news as an insult to all legitimate news journalist and doesn't make it listen to

[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:09.640]
caller after caller tell you how great you are doesn't make it and is boring calling your

[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.780]
competitors names on the air when they can't respond to you don't really doesn't make it but is

[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:18.240]
cowardly quite frankly if you were in a market with any sophistication like Boston or New York

[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.900]
issue wouldn't make it they'd be fighting it out for last place with the motivation station right

[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:28.520]
Steve Cain spelled C.A.I.N. as in Cain and Unable has challenged you on a number of occasions to go

[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.820]
on head to head with them on the air I know you think issue oriented programming sucks but why don't

[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.460]
you take him up on it it could make for some great radio and if things got a little tough you could

[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.800]
always start cackling science Susan Martin in Fort Lauderdale shut it dumb douche bag okay

[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:47.800]

[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.640]
like Susan this great I'll be interesting to see if you have the balls to read this letter over

[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:01.720]
the air I don't think you will but perhaps some of these other guys with the low ratings might

[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.420]
it will only take a couple of them to reach an audience the size of yours although it won't be

[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:10.420]
filled with little boys from Cooper City high school boy boy carbon copy Steve Cain Paul Isle

[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:17.080]
Joy Reynolds Greg B.D.L. and Jeff Charles let's hear it we got a real douche bag you dumb bitch

she's probably not away from it you know here she's listening right are you kidding me she

[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:24.800]
wouldn't miss the show she gets sexual excitement from this show not a word she's got one of those

[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:30.540]
vibrator radios oh my god it's incredible fact if you knew where all of us were right now

[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:37.120]
I like it oh I feel like I'm being sucked into the grand canyon ladies and gentlemen this is good

[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:43.200]
it's 11 past six on Zeta 4 or something very close to that size anyway we do have unlines to

[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:14.280]

[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.040]
view meter both needles are moving identically okay I think you have a needle problem

[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:29.860]
there but I don't think it's on the board well isn't it funny that he noticed it too well like I said

[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:36.620]
words of a feather inject together it's 12 minutes after six on Zeta 4 let's take our first call

[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:57.120]
sending it to all these other people so they'll read it out yeah it's like so ridiculous if you want

[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.180]

[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:18.860]

[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:42.620]
long time ago so what's up this morning not much I just want to ask a question what do you think

[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:48.360]
is going to happen to this robber w walker after he testifies and all those goodies I don't know

[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.620]
anything about a while they're going through that license thing now over there oh that's not pay

[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:58.840]
all a deal oh still no it never really stone and everything and it's like they got they got one

[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.500]
company that wants to get one hundred off the air and everything and they're creating whole big

[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:09.980]
scandal and each a cocaine or whatever to play the records and stuff well I don't know what's

[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.180]
going to happen but I do hope that they stay on the air because I like stations that have 10-year-old

[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:17.660]
program directors oh god damn yeah can I sniff a little vixen piece here what do you have to

[00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:36.470]

[00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:45.950]
my dad he was on the radio oh sure yeah he's been here a long time oh yeah anyway I just want

[00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:49.250]
to know your opinion because it's like a lot of people are saying wow this guy's going to get

[00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:53.330]
this guy's going to get well it would be easy for us to take cheap shots but we don't do that

[00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:23.870]
for the bag boys at Pueblox really I think we made that up I didn't know anything about it we

[00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:28.330]
wouldn't want to disappoint Susan would we Susan Martin in Fort Lauderdale at the douche bag

[00:51:53.330 --> 00:52:00.290]
sheer mask let's go to Hollywood next hello oh how you doing yes sir yeah if I have a great

[00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:05.370]
topic for you okay you ever work with scouts boy scouts no I'm afraid I have it sir but it's

[00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:09.730]
certainly something to think about isn't it yeah well there was a newspaper how they made

[00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:16.270]
do you ever see a grown man stark naked yeah yeah do you ever hang around the locker room

[00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:21.750]
huh no do you ever watch movies about Roman gladiates yeah gladiates I've got mentioned airplay

[00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:29.010]
before just talking go ahead I know they had a newspaper how they're making it's legal to have

[00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:37.470]
female scout masters no how females can be in charge of boys from 10 years old to 18 years old

[00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:42.490]
yeah well I think that may be a good idea how do you join big day wants to know how you join

[00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:48.710]
yeah how do you join well I don't think it's legal because I think a man I think a boy needs a male

[00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:53.330]
role model you agree with that yeah that's why they ought to have some of those butch women

[00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:59.430]
be the scot masters okay well if you ever look at the 10 leaders the cubs guts and back what they

[00:52:59.430 --> 00:53:04.470]
look like yeah that's true yeah it's like a requirement you have to weigh over 400 pounds you got it

[00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:11.110]
so anyways I think you guys are great and you know you know you should do look up that rating a foam

[00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:16.390]
bump great common name though don't you think Susan Martin I think there might be a few of them

[00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:24.890]

oh

[01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:37.590]
maybe like Stevie wanted to come in here and help me with this.

[01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.970]
Davey, hello.

[01:07:39.210 --> 01:07:39.410]
Hello.

[01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:40.490]
I got the right line.

[01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.990]
Yeah.

[01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.590]
Incredible.

[01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:42.790]
Do I do a good work or what?

[01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:43.490]
Oh great.

[01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:45.310]
So what's up in Davey?

[01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:46.270]
Um.

[01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:47.190]
Besides breakfast.

[01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.830]
What?

[01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:49.910]
I said is it nice day in Davey?

[01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:50.750]
I don't know.

[01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:51.510]
I just woke up.

[01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:52.010]
Oh okay.

[01:07:52.310 --> 01:07:52.810]
I don't know.

[01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:54.270]
Well, I haven't even left yet long enough.

[01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:55.170]
I should turn my chair.

[01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:55.410]
Okay.

[01:07:55.410 --> 01:07:55.710]
Just a minute.

[01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:56.550]
J.G.

[01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:58.550]
Here wants me to turn my head.

[01:07:58.550 --> 01:07:59.570]
Now we're not getting in the way.

[01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:00.830]
Oh okay.

[01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:02.150]
We don't want to get in your way.

[01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:03.910]
What are you saying?

[01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:06.670]
I have to go to school.

[01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:06.670]

[01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:06.670]

[01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:07.030]
Okay.

[01:08:07.210 --> 01:08:07.510]
That's it.

[01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:07.750]
Nice.

[01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:13.170]
But I heard a call yesterday about that power 96 commercial.

[01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:13.750]
Oh yeah.

[01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:15.370]
About that goofball who starts barking?

[01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:15.750]
Yeah.

[01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:18.990]
Has anybody called and tell you what that guy said?

[01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:19.170]
No.

[01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:20.510]
In fact, I saw it again last night.

[01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:21.390]
But he's such a...

[01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:23.550]
You just really can't concentrate on what he's saying.

[01:08:23.650 --> 01:08:23.650]

[01:08:23.650 --> 01:08:24.510]
Because he's such a jerk.

[01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:27.190]
He says power 96 makes me wild.

[01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:27.950]
Well, for sure.

[01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:28.450]
Oh yeah.

[01:08:29.010 --> 01:08:31.190]
I don't think he needs power 96 to be wild.

[01:08:31.290 --> 01:08:31.750]
If you know what I mean.

[01:08:32.010 --> 01:08:32.510]
I don't know.

[01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:33.670]
I think he...

[01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:36.990]
But I just wanted to call because you said you're...

[01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:37.710]
Are you from Rochester?

[01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:38.410]
Yeah.

[01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:39.790]
I'm from Selvakri.

[01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:40.450]
Great.

[01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:41.550]
No, that is...

[01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:41.790]
No.

[01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:43.490]
I haven't heard of it.

[01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:44.310]
What?

[01:08:44.530 --> 01:08:45.010]
Where is it?

[01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:46.230]
It's up in New York.

[01:08:46.850 --> 01:08:49.930]
It's like 40 miles near Buffalo.

[01:08:50.650 --> 01:08:51.890]
Is it like near Cheek to Waga?

[01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:52.430]
Yeah.

[01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:54.850]
And Zeldy and Fadalnia.

[01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:55.570]
And Ta-Nawanda.

[01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:56.870]
Oh, it's down by Erie.

[01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:57.910]
In other words, on the way to Erie.

[01:08:58.050 --> 01:08:58.870]
Is it near Hamburg?

[01:08:59.470 --> 01:08:59.670]
Yeah.

[01:08:59.810 --> 01:09:00.590]
Near the racetrack.

[01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:01.030]
Yeah.

[01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:02.230]
Oh, I left a lot of my money there.

[01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:02.830]
Let me tell you.

[01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:03.630]
Oh, okay.

[01:09:03.790 --> 01:09:04.550]
That's a low race way.

[01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:05.870]
Hey, here's another good one.

[01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:07.890]
You know, last week we irritated the bird talking about Michigan.

[01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:09.510]
This week we can blow up in New York again.

[01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:10.230]
He's very upset.

[01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.670]
Why?

[01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:11.870]
Because he's from Lakeland.

[01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:12.310]
He's a...

[01:09:12.310 --> 01:09:13.190]
Yoko from Lakeland.

[01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:13.850]
Where's Lakeland?

[01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.710]
Where's Lakeland?

[01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:17.550]
It's between Hell and a dark place.

[01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:19.110]
How is that?

[01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:19.750]
Is that down here?

[01:09:19.930 --> 01:09:20.650]
Yeah, it's in Florida.

[01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:21.850]
It's up there near a game.

[01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:23.370]
Oh, nobody's born in Florida.

[01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:23.990]
I know.

[01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:25.250]
I am.

[01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:27.290]
Captain Dave was born in Wilmulton, too.

[01:09:27.450 --> 01:09:28.470]
Captain Dave was, too.

[01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:30.310]
Yeah, two of us here were born in Florida.

[01:09:30.310 --> 01:09:30.670]
Yeah.

[01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.390]
Well.

[01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:32.910]
Okay, which way do I turn?

[01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:33.490]
What is...

[01:09:33.490 --> 01:09:34.110]
I have to go on this side.

[01:09:34.450 --> 01:09:34.730]
This way.

[01:09:34.890 --> 01:09:36.190]
Oh, this is good.

[01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:37.090]
Now I can see the cracks.

[01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:40.370]
Okay, it's 18, 20, and I'm not even moving the mic around.

[01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:41.330]
I like this.

[01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:42.010]
We can do the survey.

[01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:44.270]
I have something like, I'm not in the right union to do that anyway.

[01:09:44.650 --> 01:09:45.330]
Tell me, I like it.

[01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:46.150]
Yeah.

[01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:46.910]
I have to go.

[01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.890]
Okay, have a nice day.

[01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:48.430]
Thank you, too.

[01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:48.830]
Bye-bye.

[01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:52.510]
Oh, boy, I'm not ready to be doing all the stretching.

[01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:56.170]
Okay, you just go ahead and putt, and I'm sure these guys can fill the time with no problem.

[01:09:56.590 --> 01:09:58.090]
Doon, doon, doon, doon, doon.

[01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.390]

[01:09:58.390 --> 01:10:02.130]
Doon, doon, doon, doon, doon.

[01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:06.110]
Whoa, Glenn.

[01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.590]

[01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:07.070]
Wow.

[01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:08.150]
What did you guys...

[01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:09.410]
I'm like, we've you a movie, for example.

[01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:10.630]
Well, it's just...

[01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:12.130]
Have you seen Hardbody's Three?

[01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:13.050]
Three?

[01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:13.470]

[01:10:14.890 --> 01:10:15.690]
Excellent movie.

[01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:16.330]
Mm-hmm.

[01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:20.150]
Oh, by the way, there's another movie running on cable big day about arm wrestling.

[01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:22.850]
You know, if you look at the tops so much, I saw it yesterday.

[01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:25.750]
It's called Peakein the Kid with Molly Ringleau.

[01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:26.550]
I love her.

[01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:27.810]
Yeah, she's my favorite.

[01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:28.830]
Look for that one on cable.

[01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:30.330]
Peakein and the Kid.

[01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:33.290]
I'll be going on with a beating bread.

[01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:34.790]
Paul Lamont's an arm wrestler.

[01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:35.390]
Hmm.

[01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:36.450]
That's my girlfriend.

[01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.970]
No.

[01:10:37.290 --> 01:10:39.770]
She looks like she's got like rats in her ear or something like that.

[01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:41.110]
What are you talking about?

[01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:41.850]
Molly Ringleau.

[01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:42.070]
Oh.

[01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:43.570]
By the way, I want to say how to Carol.

[01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:49.330]
We can't federal law prohibits us from doing it, but JT wanted us to say how to Carol,

[01:10:49.330 --> 01:10:50.550]
who's his lovely wife.

[01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:52.710]
What else can we do for you doing here?

[01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:53.730]
Do we want to give some other personal messages?

[01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:55.090]
Yes, I want to say hello to her.

[01:10:57.870 --> 01:11:08.890]

Yeah, you needed to buy one.

[01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:26.950]
Nope.

[01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:28.350]

[01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:31.390]
Yep.

[01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:31.570]
I've been Apple Adam.

[01:24:31.570 --> 01:24:31.570]

[01:24:31.570 --> 01:24:31.570]

[01:24:31.570 --> 01:24:31.570]

[01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:34.690]
I'm going to hold this bike

[01:24:34.690 --> 01:24:37.910]
guy's wearing a skin as they drove my coat.

[01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.910]

[01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:39.850]
I'm gonna try to distract us to get the audience

[01:24:39.850 --> 01:24:41.430]
tuning over to Joey or something.

[01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:41.730]

[01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:44.490]
But you guys are still doing pretty good.

[01:24:44.570 --> 01:24:46.950]
Can say I by waking congratulations on the travel show

[01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:47.990]
and the plant show on the weekend.

[01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:49.470]
Are you guys are really doing it?

[01:24:49.470 --> 01:24:50.490]
The total traveler.

[01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:53.190]
Yeah, one of the collaters changing to KAT.

[01:24:53.690 --> 01:24:55.790]
Anyway, that's Mike Will from our sister's day,

[01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:57.290]
sister-relaw station up there at the other end

[01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:58.370]
of the building to dying 8am.

[01:24:58.430 --> 01:25:02.510]
It's 10.07 on Zeta 4 and laugh now and we played our mic.

[01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:05.350]
Do you mean by sure it's in 7.02?

[01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:07.810]
Well, it should have been nice having Captain Dave with us

[01:25:07.810 --> 01:25:09.330]
earlier in the show when he was shaking to it

[01:25:09.330 --> 01:25:10.650]
and have a great weekend.

[01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:11.490]
Gonji's next.

[01:25:11.850 --> 01:25:12.650]
Your hair looks great.

[01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:13.690]
And my hair does look great.

[01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:15.630]
I certainly hope so and we're gonna.

[01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:18.090]
And isn't it ashamed that we can't take pictures

[01:25:18.090 --> 01:25:19.090]
with my hair looking like this,

[01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:20.930]
but we have a lot of other important things to do.

[01:25:21.210 --> 01:25:22.710]
Yeah, and it just isn't gonna work out.

[01:25:22.830 --> 01:25:24.690]
And that's what that's what's gonna happen every time they make

[01:25:24.690 --> 01:25:26.510]
these. See, I was told it was a week from today,

[01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:29.150]
which I'm sure I could have arranged my life around that.

[01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:31.230]
But then you came up with a couple of other dates

[01:25:31.230 --> 01:25:32.870]
that they for some peculiar reason ignored.

[01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:33.370]
Ignored.

[01:25:33.370 --> 01:25:35.170]
So we're just gonna go ahead and live our lives

[01:25:35.170 --> 01:25:37.730]
and looking to the fullest and ignore them, right?

[01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:39.570]
Yeah, we shine us.

[01:25:39.690 --> 01:25:40.270]
We shine them.

[01:25:40.370 --> 01:25:42.510]
Tit for tat and all that other good stuff.

[01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:43.170]
Nobody you doing.

[01:25:43.170 --> 01:25:44.470]
Am I not gonna place something in here?

[01:25:44.610 --> 01:25:45.550]
That's a low hot Friday.

[01:25:46.670 --> 01:25:48.230]
He's wearing his low hot shirt again.

[01:25:48.670 --> 01:25:50.810]
I don't care now because it's not a low hot Friday.

[01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:53.670]
I wonder if Ed has got any final comments here.

[01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:55.450]
But I don't have a copy of it now I do

[01:25:55.450 --> 01:25:56.570]
because I did take the show.

[01:25:56.690 --> 01:25:58.110]
Thank you very much for playing that.

[01:25:58.410 --> 01:25:58.730]
Okay.

[01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:00.890]
It's all nice to hear from you, Ed.

[01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:02.410]
It's always pleasure to do a business with you.

[01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:04.250]
Now that will continue on Monday, right?

[01:26:04.330 --> 01:26:05.330]
To be continued.
