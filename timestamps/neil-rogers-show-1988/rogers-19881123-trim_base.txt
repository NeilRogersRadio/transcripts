[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]
Grace lands rocking six feet above me

[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.720]
And everybody's talking about my lease on the ring

[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.380]
She dies a night but was it really love or oh

[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.280]
She got knocked up, hmm, hmm, hey

[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.020]
Oh well they had a little weapon for my princess bride

[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.100]
I would have been invited if I hadn't a die

[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.340]
I wish somebody would have done me up my little girl

[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.340]
She got knocked up, hmm, hmm, hey

[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.080]
Well please won't you tell me little lease of Marie

[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.420]
Why'd you bind you a jerk in the Scientology

[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.560]
Did you marry him because they drove you out

[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.100]
Or cause he got you

[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.440]
And with childs he got silless looks

[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.080]
But how can it be

[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.340]
For every day you're looking more and more like me

[00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.360]
And soon you'll be wearing a double decap

[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.160]
You're getting big, hmm

[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.620]
When you get knocked up, hmm, hmm, hey

[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.320]
Well you're barely smoothing so he gave you ring

[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.700]
And pretty soon I'll be the grand-paw king

[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.860]
Your husband and your kid are now in line

[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.120]
To all cash in on the king's gold mine

[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.140]
Now if I was alive you know what I'd say

[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.380]
A lease of Marie, now how'd you get this way

[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.760]
If I hadn't fried you know I'd hang my head

[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.920]
But I can't, hmm, I'm already dead, hmm, hmm, hey

[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.080]
Yeah, hmm, hmm, hey

[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.820]
You got knocked up

[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.900]
Okay, I told Elvis was still alive

[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.180]
He's got some great new material out

[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.880]
We're going to be playing more of it as the weeks go on

[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.720]
Listen it was great hearing from Annie and Trinnell

[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.780]
On Newstalk Radio 610 WIOD

[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.920]
Hello, I'm Saul and I'm Harry

[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.000]
Here to tell you about a special place

[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.060]
Just a short little zard

[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.620]
Come to York, he's the poke nose

[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.780]
Let's go

[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.680]
That's where I wanna go

[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.920]
To get away from it all

[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.400]
There was that in the poke nose

[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.440]
He can feel that big

[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.940]
I love that stuff

[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.480]
A waste of all the boredies you wish

[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.860]
I got a nine, go for Saturday brunch

[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.480]
Or for the food on top of your day

[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.180]
I hope it's kosher in the poke nose

[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.980]
Skytop and bar kill

[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.940]
Camel, bank and bush kill

[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.880]
Mount Ellie and Shawnee

[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.660]
They're even making ruining

[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.920]
Let rock and Tesco

[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.580]
Oh, we let's go poking in the poke nose

[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.420]
We'll have some lunch

[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.800]
And then we'll see our show

[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.380]
With Tony Orlando

[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.640]
In the poke nose

[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.260]
Get a hot shade of time

[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.500]
You put a champagne

[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.500]
Sit by the pool and act like a club

[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.880]
Let's get the chicks

[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.840]
You can meet a nice girl

[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.740]
Over by the exercise club

[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.940]
Hey, cutie over here

[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.160]
In the poke nose

[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.840]
Skytop and bar kill

[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.880]
Camel, bank and bush kill

[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.800]
Mount Ellie and Shawnee

[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.120]
Don't forget making rainbows

[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.060]
Play rocks and Tesco

[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.360]
Oh, we let's go poking in the poke nose

[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.440]
We'll have some lunch

[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.080]
And then we'll see our show

[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.320]
With Tony Orlando

[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.220]
In the poke nose

[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.020]
Let's go, just forget to teach it

[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.840]
I know I got my teaching in the little bag

[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.160]
With the water in the effort there

[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.900]
It's 1209 at WIOD

[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.940]
And talk about picking out, man

[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.720]
I have scenes of disgusting displays in my time

[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.900]
Many in recent months

[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.260]
But why are you picking out on a Thai food

[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.420]
You're just eating it all yourself

[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.560]
You haven't even offered Nick any of that chicken

[00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.620]
You don't want any?

[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.720]
Chicken wings

[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.460]
How about some patai?

[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.820]
Are you sure now?

[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.580]
You sure?

[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.740]
You're positive

[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.840]
Okay, I want you to offer it to everybody in the building

[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.220]
First before you keep...

[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.340]
You're just going crazy

[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.320]
You started out with a hot and sour soup

[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.440]
And then you went...

[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.140]
I don't even know what you ate after that

[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.620]
But it hasn't stopped

[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.320]
I'm chicken

[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.000]
Yeah

[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.040]
And now patai

[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.720]
Very normal

[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.200]
And that's it?

[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.800]
Yeah

[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.900]
Okay, so I only got two or three more containers to attack here

[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.460]
So good luck to you

[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.160]
And this is the guy who was so panicky that I was going on a diet

[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.820]
And he wouldn't get any food in here every day

[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:36.340]
Incredible

[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.880]
Now I got my milkshake right here in my WGBS Allen Berk Cup

[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.300]
Oh, you haven't sent me this

[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.660]
Look at it

[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.540]
The beans on the other side of that

[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.000]
And, Kraboam Jellies

[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.060]
What can I say?

[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.320]
And out here comes even more stuff

[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.200]
More mung

[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.960]
What is that?

[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.660]
It's more mung

[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.240]
Oh, no, no, don't give that to him

[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.840]
I'm telling you, he'll just go crazy

[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.880]
Ooh, that's too far

[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.100]
He'll start hyperventilating

[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.580]
What is it?

[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.860]
Okay, let's go back to the calls and continue the show

[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.800]
Lunch break, be a little bit later on

[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.700]
Let's go to Volka

[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.020]
Hello

[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.980]
Hi, Neil

[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:07.660]
How you doing?

[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.640]
I'd like to apologize for all the jerks up here in Volka

[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.340]
That I've been calling you

[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.500]
Showed a past couple days

[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.960]
Well, I probably your neighbor is pal

[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.220]
You're probably right, you know, there's a word for those people

[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.220]
Volka brats

[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.740]
That's what we call the

[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.340]
Plastic people

[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.020]
Yeah, there's a lot of plasticity up there

[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.540]
In fact, if we have a day about 98 this summer

[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.040]
That town is gonna melt

[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.760]
There'll be just a little puddle where Volka used to be on a map

[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.420]
You're right

[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.320]
Last night I finally got to watch the movie China girl

[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.680]
And it was a pretty good flick

[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.320]
Where did you see that?

[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.720]
I rented it

[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.300]
Oh, I see you rented a video

[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.100]
Yeah, it's good

[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.260]
Man, I'm telling you it's good. It was good for me

[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.780]
I'll tell you that

[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.280]
Is your running on a same axis?

[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.960]
I think so

[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.000]
Well, don't make the guy feel bad

[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.660]
Because he probably got into max and he went out

[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.880]
No, actually I don't

[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.380]
Good, see now you feel better, right?

[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.040]
I feel much better

[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.280]
Good

[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.740]
Anyways

[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.240]
Yeah, moving right along

[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.080]
Moving right along

[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.580]
I don't have a real lot to say

[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.100]
Well, that's okay because you're a great caller from Volka

[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.920]
How old are you, sir?

[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.700]
I'm 21

[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.920]
21, aren't you?

[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.880]
In Volka?

[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.620]
In Volka, yeah

[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.280]
Wow

[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.640]
What happened? You get like hijacked or something?

[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.100]
Can you remember when Volka used to be this little small little hamlet

[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.600]
And it was so nice and nobody was there

[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.640]
You're like about in what?

[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.080]
September

[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.840]
I'm pretty far west in Volka

[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.460]
I'm already out by 441

[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.080]
And they're moving west

[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.540]
Uh-huh

[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.900]
Fast

[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.580]
Yeah, well always

[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.600]
I think they're opening a Sadie's buffet out there

[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.500]
That's what's doing it

[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.840]
Please

[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.320]
Okay, listen, you have a great holiday and we'll talk to you again

[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.740]
It's really quick one last thing

[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.240]
I went to Charlotte the other day on commercial boulevard

[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.580]
Yeah

[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.040]
And you're right, it is the best thing since Don and Bob

[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.120]
I'd compare it to Bill Gray's actually

[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.540]
Bill Gray's

[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.740]
Yeah, you read Bill Gray's?

[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.040]
That name sounds very familiar

[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.920]
It's up there

[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.960]
And it's Rochester

[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.500]
Bill Gray's?

[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.840]
Yeah

[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.540]
What is it?

[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.780]
It's a franchise up in Rochester of like hamburger joints

[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.740]
I don't think I was ever there, the name sounds familiar

[00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.800]
I know, Vick and Irv's

[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.200]
But let's not get started on it again

[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.960]
Now somebody get a real eye on this sneak in

[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.540]
You're trying to get him upset just at the end of the call

[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.460]
This sneak a little bit

[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.320]
Okay, you have a good one now

[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.360]
Okay, just to make bird feel better

[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.040]
I know Alan and I think he's a jerk

[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.580]
How's that?

[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.220]
All right

[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.240]
I have a good day

[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.660]
I have a good day

[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.100]
I have an excellent call

[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.860]
He knows Alan

[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.160]
I bet you Alan, I bet you a lot of our Cooper City people are home for the holidays

[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.160]
Don't you think so?

[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:20.520]
Yeah

[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.060]
As they say in Pittsburgh holiday

[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.320]
I think they can find us

[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.980]
As in dollar

[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:24.680]
Because we're not

[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.200]
We're not where we were

[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.860]
I think they can

[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.140]
Oh yeah, Alan will find us

[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.620]
In fact, if Alan's listening right now we invite him to come by and the studio and eat some of the bird's food

[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.860]
Hey, tomorrow would be a great day

[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.200]
They have a bunch of those people come by Alan and who else don't you like?

[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.300]
We could have Charlie from BCC

[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.360]
He's a good guy

[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.560]
Stem could come in

[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.200]
Big Dave

[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.620]
Speaking of somebody coming in tomorrow

[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.540]
You'll never guess who is going to be here tomorrow

[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.520]
Let me hold on to something

[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.720]
No, no, it's not anybody that you were that he's here every Thursday

[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.080]
Fat Rich is going to be here

[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.400]
I said even on Thanksgiving, huh?

[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.380]
So he's going to bring us home

[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.380]
Yeah, he's going to bring the avion and Thanksgiving peace

[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:05.820]
And a salad

[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.920]
Little fruit

[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.880]
Oh good

[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.920]
No, no, no, no, no, go bring a lot of food here Rich

[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.460]
You're going to have serious problems

[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:11.980]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.860]
Now we're a Spencer

[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.280]
Spencer should be here around 1230

[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.220]
That's the popular rumor

[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.920]
So if anybody's listening out there in the executive or offices

[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.160]
When Spencer gets here and direct him right back into here boy, get him right here

[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.960]
No, seriously because we get if he's going to be here at 1230 every Wednesday

[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.160]
He's going to get our cars first because by two it's audio

[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.200]
So I know that sounds unreasonable to some people

[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.760]
But it takes me longer

[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.560]
No, it takes me longer to get home than it takes me to get here in the morning

[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.500]
And mornings is snap most mornings

[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.380]
But getting out of this God for a second place man

[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.160]
It takes forever

[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.100]
And especially when you get out there on 79th Street

[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:45.600]
Boy

[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.620]
Well, or 82nd Street

[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:47.840]
Yeah

[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.600]
Everybody's going about two miles an hour

[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.400]
Yeah, they're terrifying to move

[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:51.900]
Of what?

[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:52.860]
You got me

[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.280]
You got me, they don't mind me

[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.080]
They might be frightened

[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.960]
Okay, let's go to Hollywood

[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.460]
Hello

[00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.160]
Hey, no

[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.640]
Of course if you were driving on 79th Street you'd be frightened too

[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.100]
Yes sir

[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:02.720]
How'd it go?

[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.880]
It's going good

[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:04.500]
Right

[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.400]
Yes sir

[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.960]
It sounds like a chronic regular to me doesn't it?

[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:09.980]
Who is this?

[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:10.460]
Huh?

[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.680]
Who is this?

[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:12.260]
Mark

[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.940]
Mark from Boka

[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.300]
No, I'm not in Boka

[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.700]
Okay, well go ahead Mark

[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.760]
Whatever happened in that group men at work

[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.220]
Men at work

[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.580]
Trust me

[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.580]
Well they had a hit or two and it liked so many groups that was it

[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.380]
What do you want Mark?

[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.460]
What's your real story here?

[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.020]
Come on

[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.620]
Let's keep building the ocean set a couple of number one songs

[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.520]
And then he went to number two but the next one

[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.520]
Yeah, yeah I knew that was going to find me

[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.680]
Yeah I know his voice now

[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.300]
Now I got it

[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.660]
Just rambles on and on in coherently

[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.080]
But God, thank God we can be here for Mark

[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.000]
Because he needs the therapy

[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.860]
One thing I've discovered about these milkshakes they're pretty good

[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.720]
They're really hard good

[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.200]
Mm-hmm

[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.400]
Would you got a drink them fast?

[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:48.760]
Oh

[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.040]
Yeah, because otherwise they start getting lumpy

[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.580]
Oh, okay

[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.460]
Although part of the problem is that 1902 blender

[00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.960]
They got down to cafeteria here

[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.800]
I think I'm going to bring Malau I can

[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.120]
I'm going to have to get another blender

[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.100]
Now did you look closely at that pose that Alan has on it?

[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.320]
So I'm not looking closely at Alan Peary

[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.420]
I just had my shake, that's my lunch

[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.800]
And I will not look closely at the dinner or lunch, okay?

[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:15.560]
Let's go to a Miami Lake

[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:16.420]
Hello

[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.200]
Hello

[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:17.340]
Hi

[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:17.680]
Neil?

[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:18.140]
Yeah

[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:18.620]
Hi

[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.540]
I have a funny story to share with you about my 14 and a half year old daughter

[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.020]
Okay

[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.880]
I'm an AM convert because of you

[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.080]
I had WIO D on all day Friday

[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.620]
Great

[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.000]
And Friday evening I was driving my daughter to a friend's house

[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.080]
And she the radio was on

[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.580]
And she said what's this?

[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.060]
I said it's the radio

[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.740]
She said is this?

[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:42.680]
AM?

[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.300]
Yeah, what is that?

[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.460]
I said yes

[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.360]
She said oh my God

[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.800]
And she got very teary eyed and she said

[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.740]
don't you understand I'm still a child?

[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:54.480]
I had a...

[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.580]
What does that mean?

[00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.500]
She said did you listen to AM when my brothers were children?

[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:01.860]
She has two older brothers

[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.240]
Yeah

[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.580]
I said what does this mean?

[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.320]
She said don't you understand?

[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.880]
AM is old and you are old and you're not old and I don't want you to be old

[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.940]
I was putting one of my own feet in the grave

[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:16.400]
Yeah

[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.860]
By listening to AM?

[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.400]
Most of the...

[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.020]
She probably thought you were listening to WOLD

[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:22.640]
Right

[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:23.820]
Exactly

[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.980]
I thought you'd enjoy that story

[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.520]
That's cute

[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.280]
Because she overreacted

[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.080]
Yeah, I tell your daughter stop being so emotional

[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.240]
Okay, that would be a good start

[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.540]
Okay, I'll give her the message

[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:32.900]
Okay

[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.880]
Bye-bye

[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:34.680]
That's cute

[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.580]
Not real cute, but cute

[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.840]
Well, I'm 16 at WIO D

[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.720]
And I keep forgetting tomorrow I promise

[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.860]
But I can't bring...

[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.080]
Oh yeah, we can just play the record

[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.540]
W-O-L-D

[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.880]
Like Casey says

[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.840]
Just play the record

[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.700]
Okay, because it's getting pretty ponderous

[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.240]
I'll bring in WOLD tomorrow

[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.820]
Play it for all our friends for Al Biers

[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.300]
And all those other folks over at WSK

[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.720]
I wonder if they're going to be taping on Thanksgiving

[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:58.580]
Absolutely

[00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.080]
They think so?

[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.500]
They will be taping on Thanksgiving

[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:01.600]
We'll find out

[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.240]
Over time

[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.660]
Okay, let's go to Pompo-no

[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:05.820]
Hey, Nell

[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:06.420]
How are you?

[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.360]
Pretty good, how are you?

[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.560]
Great, how are you, Don?

[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:08.880]
Great

[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.460]
Hey, I wanted to ask you about a couple of things

[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.520]
First is good to hear Stan's voice yesterday

[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.800]
Yeah, we had a good time

[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:16.200]
Yeah

[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.800]
Everybody of mine said, um, I've been hearing most of your bits from FM

[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.100]
But, and hey, I'm the old good, that's right in here

[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.100]
He said you got a new one about a rubber or something

[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.600]
Oh yeah, the kind of...

[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:25.920]
The kind of miracle, I heard

[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.580]
The kind of song, well that's from...

[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.340]
We got a borrow that from GTRC

[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.200]
That's herment of McQueen, that's their bit

[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:31.700]
Oh

[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.020]
And they've been loaning it to us

[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:33.740]
But every time we...

[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.420]
I don't know why...

[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.860]
Can't we get our own cart of that?

[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.320]
Why do we have to keep borrowing their cart, Nick?

[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.180]
Well, have you heard the content of it?

[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.440]
And they were afraid

[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:43.180]
What's that?

[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.640]
We're afraid of what?

[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.120]
Well, have you heard it?

[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.200]
Yeah, we're not afraid

[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.140]
But listen, anything he says

[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.160]
We'll borrow it from him, we'll beg and get it from him

Why don't you share some of this food with these nice people who are just desperate who are looking in here?

[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.280]

Ok now just calm down folks we're back on here it's 1224 at W-W-O-D

[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.320]
Everybody's in a frenzy now see it was a little difficult getting them to come in

[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.880]
But once they did they cleaned the whole place up which is good that's the way we like it

[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:18.320]
Yeah and having this disgusting mess what would you say if Mitch came running in here when he had his mess all over the table with Meng

[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.600]
Just teeming off the edges of the table

[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.200]
Look at that radar you see what's going on over the state all right

[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.020]
Ok let's go to Hollywood hello

[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.040]
Yeah how you doing Neil?

[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:33.580]
Pretty good you got to excuse a bird I think he's having a CB complex over there

[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.860]
Yeah sure is he's a I'm telling you all the young women in this building man

[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.420]
They're running in any direction they can now he's going to have a Paul Harvey Jr call yesterday

[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.800]
Yeah the picture I know you probably thinking about a little bit too much

[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.180]
Yeah I think that's it

[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:51.240]
Just had to eat the candy did you see the bro call special on seven about the candy?

[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:57.240]
We all I watched a little bit of that during the I was switching back and forth between the Heraldoa obscenity and that thing

[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:04.660]
And you know you've seen it over and over and over again and again you know and not only that but I get really emotional about all of that

[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:12.820]
It has a very traumatic effect on me I mean I think I've cried enough in the last week to make Alison Wonderland float away with all of this

[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:19.240]
You know it was a very painful and very difficult thing for a lot of us I was 21 years old when Kennedy was assassinated

[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:24.560]
When he was running for president I saw him speak at Michigan State and then the next day I saw Nixon speak

[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:30.200]
So it didn't you know wasn't really difficult figuring out who I liked but you know enough is enough already man

[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.440]
They don't know everything they do is got to be overkill

[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.540]
Yeah I mean I was a question I wasn't even you know I wasn't even born

[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.180]
You weren't even an idea yet

[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.840]
And uh anyone

[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:47.260]
Well let me tell you something though I don't want to get too modeling but the young people who were born since president Kennedy was assassinated

[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:53.600]
No nothing about leadership I mean this was a guy who had just certain intangible qualities that you can't define

[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:59.400]
In other words a leader is a leader and you can't make somebody that you either have those qualities or you don't

[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:06.600]
And he did and since then we've had a succession of morons like Ford and Nixon and Carter and you know eight years of repression under Reagan

[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:12.460]
And now we got a real you know Mung Brain that's coming in there now so it's deep pressure

[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.200]
It's deep pressing but what can I say?

[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.020]
Not getting any but how did you see the Vanna movie?

[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:22.600]
No I'm afraid I didn't watch it any time in my schedule for that

[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.380]
Very very terminal

[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.260]
I'll bet you yeah

[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:34.380]
She's one of the words I'm gonna ask is it possible for myself to send you any you know tapes or songs

[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.920]
They're like a home done stuff on like a four track. Oh sure

[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.580]
You know and you guys could preview them and if you like them play them over there do whatever you want

[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.560]
Absolutely. I just want to check see if that be alright

[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.240]

[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.020]
I'm looking for that one I got him do you have him okay?

[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:15.140]
All right, thanks a lot y'all have him that'll be the day 12 30 at W I O D the near Roger show

[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.980]
We have you don't believe a word of the story either not Nick Nick said not only were you boring

[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.680]
But he doesn't believe a single word of the story

[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:28.820]
For your brutal, you know of course that's from working at W snooze all I thought they get to all those old old callers

[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.520]
How loud can I talk to Shirley?

[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.980]
Oh, Shirley is so wonderful

[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.200]
When are you going to have your next crack doc down the air?

[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:45.520]
Show me. Okay, let's go to a South Miami. Hello. Hi there. Yes, sir.

[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:51.120]
Is this fellow fat rich? Wasn't he the sit up champion of Howard County one time?

[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.180]
Yes, sir, that is correct.

[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.580]
And that was only six months ago.

[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:03.240]
What a nice day. What a call. I know I thought it was cute. I guess they he left him speechless.

[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:08.600]
Let them say speechless Miami. Hello. Yeah, hi. Hi.

[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:13.360]
My name is Carlos. I just want to say how you guys when it is Carlos. Come on stuff. Oh, yeah, he was dead.

[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.160]
Oh, so don't start now, Carl.

[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:22.460]
Listen, I just want to know you guys are talking about about food and everything.

[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:27.700]
I don't need once to get off the subject. Why are you speaking to me like in the third person?

[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.980]
No, he listened. I have no problem talking about food. There are no calories in talking about it.

[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:38.620]
I can I have developed a little bit of willpower. Not a lot, but a little bit.

[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.760]
Have you have either one of you guys ever been to Los Angeles and eaten at Tommy's?

[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.600]
I've been to Los Angeles many times. But in every in the time is I ate at Carl's, Jr.

[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:53.260]
and I ate at what's that other horrible place? Jack in a box. Oh, man.

[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.540]
Horrendous. For some burger.

[00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:00.600]
Now, you talking about Tommy Lasortis place? No, he's not talking about Tommy Lasortis.

[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.340]
Get out of here. Will you? He's never the farthest north. He's ever been in Lakeland.

[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:11.280]
What? Yeah, I think so. He said the hot sauce. He's frying your brain. Yeah, I go with you.

[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:16.780]
But no, there's Tommy Bergs. I used to live out there about three and a half or four years ago and I really miss him.

[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:21.300]
I don't know how you could live out there, man. It's such a, I mean, granted, this place is far behind.

[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:26.420]
It's like in the dark ages. But the environment out there is so horrendous and the people,

[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:32.200]
all these punks and all that like on Hollywood Boulevard all the way to Beverly Hills until you get to the sign,

[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:36.740]
which is where nobody dares step over that block. But right up until that block, man,

[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:42.160]
there are all these punks and gangs and degenerates and goofballs and tattooed weirdo.

[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.140]
It is horrendous. Yeah, the people out there are really reaching.

[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.280]
Yeah, I was only living out there for about a year.

[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:54.860]
Oh, going to school out there. Yeah, but they probably lived in a real like more settled normal place like Santa Monica.

[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.140]
I would have been good. I know for West Hollywood.

[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.820]
It's just a joke. Barbara Santa Barbara with me.

[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:06.720]
What are you?

[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.880]
Memory lane here with you guys. Okay. Okay.

[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:14.860]
Boy, now you started out great, but I have a feeling that whatever the last guy had, it's rubbing off on you.

[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.660]
No, really, you started out.

[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:23.180]
No, I just wanted to, I was just wondering about the Tommy burger, but you're the one I got into, you know, just sightseeing.

[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:27.920]
No, you're right. You're absolutely right. It was my fault. I take it all back with my phone.

[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.280]
Okay, you have a great day. I'll see you. I'll see you.

[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.580]
I'll see you. Tommy's. Okay. Bye bye.

[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:38.900]
I never heard of Tommy's in my life, but I'll take it from him. I've never seen one. I've been all over LA. I never heard of Tommy's.

[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:51.240]
No. I mean, Carl's Jr. in Jack in a box. They're on every street corner, but Tommy's no. I mean Ralph's. I know Ralph's supermarket and alpha beta and beta Zeta and Bobby's Zeta.

[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.660]
But I don't know from Tommy's Miami. Hello. Hi.

[00:26:54.660 --> 00:27:04.540]
I want to tell you both. You're both very handsome, very handsome today. Oh, yes. I work for a doctor on my M.E. Beach and my husband is telling me that you do.

[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:14.940]
You're talking about Felden. Yeah, we have a show on Felden. Tomorrow's a matter of. I was wondering if you could say it for me. What's that? What you say about Felden. Oh, no, I wouldn't do that for you, man.

[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.760]
Hello, doctor. I'm on Felden.

[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:30.060]
We have a whole show about turkeys that take Felden on Thanksgiving Day, man. It's going to be a real eye opener tomorrow. In the meantime, April Wortham standing by with the W.I.O.D. News update. It's 1234.

[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:47.580]
We're on one. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Remember we back in April. You called me out in Beverly Hills. My name is Rory. Hey, Rory. How you doing? I sure do. All right. I'm down here in Miami visiting all my buddies. Man, it is a dead town. Oh, yeah. There's nothing going on here, Rory.

[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:55.520]
Man, this is a I still want that guy who called earlier to call me on another day who left here eight years ago or nine years ago and came back. I really I blew it.

[00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:04.060]
I wanted to ask him what the deal was. I don't know. And speaking of old parts and Tommy's. What do you think you get when you go to Tommy's? Don't don't say it. Be careful.

[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:17.120]
Now, I want to say this isn't the Steve Kane show now, sir. Okay, but this is really kind of dead. Miami. The weather is really gloomy. It's so nice. Well, no, wait a minute. The weather's been pretty good. We had a couple of crappy days because of Keith. But other than that, it's been pretty nice.

[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:27.480]
You can't blame that on it, but forget about the weather. I mean, it can't control the weather here, but as far as the people and as far as the ambiance and as far as anything going on, this town is as dead as a door nail.

[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:44.140]
You should come out to California. It's real nice. Well, no, thanks. I can't breathe the air out there. I really can't. That's true. I'm serious every time I go there, I get sick. Yeah, I get a choke in my throat every night. There's something to have. Well, we don't want to talk about that. But there is such a thing as a Tommy burger, huh?

[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:53.940]
There is. There is a chain of them. They're called big Tommy's big. And for like $2.95, you get a double hamburger, a very greasy covered with chili,

[00:28:54.720 --> 00:29:08.480]
road test. Wow. It's even grosser later. Well, listen, I think I'll pass on it. How long have you done here for now? I'm in for two weeks. Wow. I'm going up to Tampa. I'm on my way to the airport this very minute.

[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:15.720]
And they're going to drop me off and go into Tampa for Thanksgiving. And then I'm coming back down here to see if it's wibened up a little. Yeah, well, you sure picked a time to go up there, whether or

[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:28.360]
be perfectly. Okay, listen, have a good time. And we'll talk to you again. All right. Thanks. Boy boy. He thinks the weather's gloomy here. Wait till he goes to Tampa. Yeah, wait for you to get over there on the West Coast and talk about not much going on.

[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:41.960]
Yeah, yeah, push gardens, I guess. Well, steak and shake and don't forget crystal on Dale Mayberry. You go to crystal pal. I just sit there and hey, just fill it up. You know, open up the

[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:57.220]
truck and let him fill him up. He's going over to Lakeland. And he can go to Lakeland on a way back. Yeah, maybe even a little trip up to Milton. See your pal. Our good buddy, 20 minutes till one at W I O D. And we're now got another mobile on five. Hello.

[00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:27.200]
Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Well, we're doing pretty good. As a matter of fact, now that you mentioned it. Oh, good. That was a bird. It's great. No, that's really funny. I've wanted to call you all day, but both times I wanted to call you someone stole my fire. I wanted to tell you that I had a copy of the asshole song. And I haven't heard you playing it. I was willing to get it to you. You haven't heard us playing it. I'm sorry. You haven't heard us playing it. I just got back in town. I've been out of town since you moved on to W I O D. We played every day. Really? Oh, yeah. Oh, that's great. I'm going to go to the

[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:34.740]
great. Yeah, I know when they took it away from you back on brand new working for those douchebags anymore. Okay, pal. So don't worry about that. They're going to get theirs.

[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:42.880]
Actually, maybe you remember the last time I called you, you were still on AM over there. And it was the day you played about 20 bits back to back. Yeah.

[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:54.840]
And I called you to ask you why you didn't play the Delta Airlines one. And you were you said that you were having a lot of problems with them that they were a little bit scared. They are. They're not. They're scared. They're very touchy, man. They're very, very sensitive.

[00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:03.000]
Now I can imagine the reason I called is that remember Mark long, long time ago, Mark.

[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:14.100]
Listen, we've had so many marks that I'm going to come on the show with the. Oh, yeah, I sure do way back then. Remember, I'm the one who called you and told you the reason he'd never show up on your show is because he was so overweight. Yeah.

[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:21.880]
And we heard from him a couple of times. He didn't like me very much for telling you that he snuck in one day when we were on Zeta.

[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:32.560]
Oh, he snuck and he came in. Yeah, I'm with Alan. That was the guy that was more of that's right with Alan. Yeah. Listen, if he'll bring Alan, he can come in on the show any time. Okay.

[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:44.300]
Oh, you know, Alan? No. Oh, well, you love Alan. Okay. Well, his reputation preseason. He was going to go to your aunt. Yeah. I'm going to screw up your home idea of UM student, family. UM student.

[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:49.940]
Now that was just, wait a minute, that was just a joke. We like to needle them a little bit because let's face it, they deserve it.

[00:31:50.560 --> 00:32:08.900]
Oh, yeah. Well, of course, they have a lot of problems in their own right. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I'm screwing up your whole demographic because I'm only 23 years old. No, that's great. That's our demo on this station, sir. Yeah. Um, no, I think it's great. I think it's so good that you have before we got here in this day party used to be 123. Oh, I know. Oh, of course.

[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:18.200]
So on Steve's show, the demographic still about 123. No, no, Steve's got a few people who are actually alive. Well, leave it or not. Are you serious? Yes, he does. Are there stone respirators?

[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:30.140]
All right. It says since when do cars have colliding call waiting? Is that colliding? Yeah, I'm not answering it on your car. It's my friends Corvette. I'm driving around in my friends Corvette. It's the

[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:39.160]
credit. I think he got his phone free with a bowl of soup and he became the program director at I.n.z. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Now the PD at I.n.z. Don't drive the Corvette. Trust me.

[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:49.800]
All right. He shouldn't not the kind of decision he made. Okay. Well, Nick had a response for that, but I can't read it on here. He doesn't believe you. Nick just a very cynical guy doesn't believe anybody.

[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:59.040]
He wants you to blow the horn in the car. The blue, the horn. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Can you do that? Do you hold the phone out the window while I blow the horn? You just have to do it now quickly.

[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:29.020]
Hold on. I'll open the window. You can even get the door open the window. I guess that answered all our questions. I think that was incredible. What is incredible? No wonder that Mark told something against him. Okay. I know what he's not going to hold against you sir. It's 1244 W I.m. Let's go. I am still in shock. Wow. That was a big win.

[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:33.540]
It didn't sound to me like he was in a car either, but I just I was gonna humor him

[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:36.740]
But then he just lost it, you know what oh?

[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:41.420]
Rolled out the window. I'll stick it out the window pal

[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.920]
You never did blow the horn by the way

[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.680]
We just maybe if it was Alan we didn't fight him to stick it out the window, but not this guy

[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:54.120]
Let's go to Hollywood. Hello uncle. Nia. Yes, sir. What's up? Oh, we're doing it, pal

[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.680]
We are really doing it man

[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.460]
Let me tell you in case you had any doubts

[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:07.220]
What what's up? Oh, we're just hanging out. Hey, I'm a big Paul Harvey fan. I love his movies. Yeah

[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.000]
Do you miss him?

[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:16.880]
I would like good day from Australia. Yeah, that's my favorite day. Oh

[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.360]
Hey bird. Yeah

[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.660]
Duke sell on crew

[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:27.260]
I can't I can't do it. That's not the rekindle memories of that night

[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:31.040]
Okay, they did a great job down there, but I was in a very I had just had one of my

[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.460]
Harrangs with the middle level management over there that day and I was ready to blow all their brains out boy

[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:42.160]
It was it was a real exciting night for me. Sorry to bring it up now. No, that's okay. Hey you guys are great, man

[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:46.300]
That's for sure originally from Connecticut, but well nobody's perfect

[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.600]
Thanks now. What are you doing here?

[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:53.720]
Watching my mom's house. She bought a house here and she can't make it here

[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:58.600]
Really? Yeah, she's trying to get a transfer out of the post office and

[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:04.960]
It's taken about a year. Yeah, so I'm just watching the place and really what a rough deal that is

[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:10.340]
Huh, and you just kind of hang out there and you're watching the house just to make sure it doesn't go anywhere like a watchdog

[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:16.300]
Yeah, excellent. Well, you keep it up. Okay. We'll send you a case of Alpo for dinner. Hey, thanks. Okay. Have a good one. Bye. Bye. Bye

[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.700]
Boy, there are million stories in the magic city. Aren't there?

[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:30.580]
While she's out there working her butt on somewhere in Connecticut or someplace. I don't understand that at all, do you?

[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.760]
I think that's a good idea. I think I'm gonna have my mom come in here and do the show

[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.200]
Starting tomorrow and I'll go watch her house

[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:39.340]
Hang out

[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.080]
Watch all those soap

[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.860]
What is that? Oh, that's my stuff from great. Thank you

[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:53.320]
From Nutri system, right? Now I want to say something because they're not starting on my shoot a next Monday as far as the sponsor

[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.300]
I want to I want to say something now that needs to be said

[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:03.500]
Because I have ripped them badly over the last couple of years and I think justifiably so based on my previous experience

[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:07.960]
Because I tried this diet four or five years ago and they admitted they they don't disagree

[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:11.300]
They say you know the food was horrendous. It was like little cans was like dog food

[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:16.680]
And I just couldn't stay on it and everybody around here has said hey, it's different. They've changed the food

[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.500]
You ought to give it a try

[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.140]
So as of Monday of this week I started it and

[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:27.100]
In fact, they brought in food last week for me to taste it to try it to see if I would like it because I wasn't gonna do it

[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:32.100]
If I didn't like the stuff and I couldn't do the program and I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that it's

[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.740]
Warmae cuisine because that that is would be ridiculous

[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:40.380]
But it's edible and it's good. It's got taste to it and it's satisfying and you get into a routine with it

[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.060]
And I'm not having any problem with it. I'm doing extremely well

[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:48.200]
And I would do even better if people would stop trying to force feed me a lot of stuff that I don't want and I don't need

[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:53.740]
Okay, if they would get the message and understand that it's a lot more important for me to lose the weight

[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.100]
Than to have any more free meals okay for a while

[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:57.980]
Okay, you get the message

[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:02.400]
So anyway, I just wanted to mention that upfront because otherwise people will be calling next week

[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.040]
Well, there you go. You've sold out. Yeah, it's got nothing to do with that

[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.800]
I you know because they have been trying to get me to do their thing for for two years. I mean desperate

[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:16.700]
And I said no and then I finally said okay if it's changed I'll give it a try and I'm delighted that I did it because I'm doing great on it

[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:24.160]

[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:56.960]

[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.960]
To work related problem

[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:12.580]
You know and landers help here. Okay, wife and I are sitting down last night talking and

[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:18.760]
Last month I worked for a real big company on year four Lauderdale and a whole month's out up in Connecticut

[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:25.100]
And I I was sent out last month with my supervisor and forgive us our annual reviews and

[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:32.400]
He told me what it was going to be and it came out to about a 9% raise which I thought was adequate for a big company. Yeah

[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.060]
Oh

[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.820]
The rays didn't come in effect until just yesterday

[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:37.140]
I

[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:43.240]
I normally just right out my check and put it in the bank don't even really look at it take it off or granted well

[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.500]
I happen to look at it and it turned out to be 20% great

[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:54.060]
I just blew my mind. I didn't know what to do. So what do you think? You're that down and

[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.760]
But go ahead. Well, I've nice that down and talked about it

[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.900]
After this phone call I'm gonna I'm gonna take your

[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:05.500]
To do whatever you think is right. Uh, I was thinking about keeping it

[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.480]
But I think you know being a big company. They'll probably find out later on

[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:12.120]
I never have any give the money back and I'm going back on my other salary and oh

[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.720]
Yeah, you're right because that happened to me one time when I was at WS news

[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:20.400]
They were overpaying me an enormous amount they were making a mistake and they were paying me my talent fees twice

[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:25.320]
Or something and it was just an enormous amount they were overpaying right and uh and to be honest with you

[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:29.460]
I wasn't trying to be dishonest at the time. I didn't know because the thing was so screwed up

[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:36.520]
But then they took it all out again. So if it's gonna get taken out I'd straighten it out now

[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:40.400]
Or you're gonna be so far in a whole man you're gonna be eating alpo for six months

[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.080]
Yeah

[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:50.580]
Well, I think he's right. I think that you should tell him and uh, otherwise you're gonna pay later

[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:54.060]
You're a damn right man, and if you happen serious if you have to have all that deducted later

[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:54.840]
You don't want to do

[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:58.600]
Okay, all right, all right, it'll be worse

[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.660]
That they love you so much. They really want to give him the sob story. I got two kids at home one in the oven and uh

[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.540]
One in the oven. Yeah

[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:12.280]
I need the extra extra money and okay listen good luck to your pal. Hey, hey nice talk to you

[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:17.540]
Okay, thanks a lot, but enough is enough. Okay, 1250. I mean some of these people there really they're all nice

[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:21.280]
But some of them are just going on and on with these stories

[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.380]
Well, it's like good guys got a little dilemma, but it was terminal

[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:29.240]
Like you say they all have stories today. Yeah, everybody days got a story. Yeah, here's the melting pot story

[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:35.280]
They have fantastic fondue. Okay. I mean so good that you are gonna do like a little tap dance in the middle of the aisle when

You're a waiter or waitress comes by

There are three melting pot locations in South Florida. They're in West Palm Beach at 3044 South military trail

[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:48.540]
They're in South Miami at 98 35 sunset drive and they're in oral springs on West sample road

[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.620]
Just east of Pine Island and the food is fantastic

You cook it right at your table the service is excellent prices are very very modest and it is delicious

[00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:01.320]
especially of course my favorite the desserts

[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.100]

You know what I'm saying like he does as only he can and there was listening to us from Jacksonville South

We don't want to get into that. No, I don't know if you remember a guy named Marshall called you

[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.060]
And he's a big league

Oh, because we don't just want to have you know, you know, we like the bird there

[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.560]
But we didn't want to have him sitting there

[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.000]
That is correct you wouldn't want to come all the way out here just to feed him and I don't blame you

[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:51.520]
But uh, is there anything at all? That's okay. No, I'm gonna say it again. There's nothing at all. Okay. I mean I'm not trying to be rude

[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:53.440]
But the answer is no

[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.480]
See you waited too long. Oh, that's what you're waiting for

[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:35.960]
Get hold of

[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:40.540]
And your

[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.260]
That's saying I'm gonna ride

[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.920]
Gary's on her ass with night

[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.440]
The heat's taking for a proof

[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.360]
Now he's sitting in the limbo blues

[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.700]
He let his vomit run his life

[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:55.380]
Now he's big and he's got no wife

[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.980]
He lost his presence at the block

[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:00.580]
When he did that thing baroque

[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:03.100]
How long comes he gone?

[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.380]
Some of these limbo's like me, so it's guys

[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:06.820]
And tell him that they're virgin

[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:07.380]
Low

[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:09.260]
Or they'll go backstage to a concert

[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.420]
And I'm a home with a roadie

[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.000]
Cause they came in out with a rock star

[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:12.680]
No

[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:14.980]
How about those girls, a 9-7-6 dial

[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:15.920]
And they've those been best

[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.760]
Yeah, they got dates all three of us

[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.720]
One's off with a pass on his eye

[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:20.080]
Okay?

[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.920]
How long has he gone?

[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.800]
I'll be low

[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.540]
How long comes he gone?

[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.600]
Now you know bimbos

[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:47.880]
One shot of tequila

[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:48.960]
They're on the floor

[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.860]
Two shots of the healers

[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:51.660]
They got the shirt off

[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.760]
And a wet t-shirt contest for $15

[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:54.760]
Low

[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.440]
Okay, I'll tell you about low

[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.220]
I admit I go out with those bin beds

[00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.260]
When they're hair all teased up

[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:01.960]
Sometimes it's so that I can make myself look smart

[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.040]
How long comes he gone?

[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.580]
And now their family are the boys

[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:09.260]
Leaves in with the thin rock star

[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:11.780]
In her shots of couples here

[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.320]
A wrinkle wine of fire here

[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.880]
That's the nimble, that's the sweet

[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.760]
That pulls on to your joy stick

[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.320]
Cause she's out between your gawks

[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.700]
When she's out the thin baroque

[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.160]
Just a cut that it would have

[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.380]
Make her splitter and be dialed

[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.540]
Now in playboy you will see

[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.920]
A reconstructed surgery

[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.780]
So get back to the daughter of yellow

[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:40.400]
So get a bigger floor of the band

[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.520]
But you'll be on the way you go

[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.620]
When you got the thin baroque

[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.480]
The bimbora

[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.000]
Yeah, that's what I thought she said

[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.120]
109 at W.I.G.

[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.180]
A little pondress there

[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.100]
But it was cute

[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:53.700]
Yeah

[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:54.980]
Let's go back to the phone show

[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.320]
Because time is a wasting

[00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:58.480]
And I do mean a wasting

[00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.420]
Delray, hello

[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:02.020]
Yeah, Neil, I'm the first time caller

[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.360]
Great, Delray

[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.660]
And you're on that balkaline

[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:06.980]
Yeah, I'm on that balkaline

[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:07.560]
I'm going to be damned

[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.440]
It sound like you're going to be a good caller to me

[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.720]
You really do, don't let me down

[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.240]
Okay, I'll try, I'll try

[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.460]
I'll try not to be as long as some of the guys

[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.240]
You had in the last hour

[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.500]
Yeah, man, some of these people

[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.740]
They think they got their own show or something

[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.460]
Yeah, I want to ask you

[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.240]
I didn't catch you, Sean Zayda too much

[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.940]
Because I wasn't around that early in the morning

[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:25.720]
I don't blame you

[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.860]
But I heard one time this song

[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:29.480]
Beat it, Michael Jackson

[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:30.740]
Think you did

[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:32.620]
Yeah

[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:33.600]
Michael Jackson glow

[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.360]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what it was

[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.440]
Yeah, that's what it was

[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.720]
Yeah, what happened to that?

[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:41.540]
Well, it's right in my hand right now

[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:42.680]
I mean the, the cart

[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.460]
You're going to get that on or if you get that on?

[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.260]
Of course, what do you think I got it out for?

[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:49.860]
Because you're such a great guy

[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:50.660]
And it's your first call

[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:51.580]
And I wouldn't want to let you down

[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:52.600]
Get your PO'd

[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.520]
Yeah, I'm a little nervous here, so I can't

[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:54.980]
But nevertheless

[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:58.880]
Anyway, I want to say how do my grandmother

[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.300]
She says she own Wilson, but I know she's listening

[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:02.860]
Right now, she's a closet listener

[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.620]
And I can't say too long, I got to go to a service car

[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:08.340]
King's Point, which I'm looking forward to

[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:10.520]
We have one here in Delray, outrest

[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.460]
Great, boy, aren't you a lucky guy?

[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.520]
What do you do?

[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:15.820]
I'm an off-squipment technician

[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.820]
I got to go into the club house

[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:19.400]
And I'm sure they're going to have you tuned in there

[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.200]
Oh, yeah, you got to service all the old parts today, huh?

[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:22.660]
Yeah

[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:23.920]
Well, I've got to look to you

[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:25.080]
Yeah, service receptionist

[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.260]
I know she's probably having a good day

[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.380]
Okay, well listen, good day to you

[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:29.060]
And have a great holiday

[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:30.980]
And it's coming up right now, so run to that radio

[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.160]
Okay, thanks, Neil

[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:32.640]
See you later

[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.040]
Good day

[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:34.920]
Ooh, listen to that

[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.580]
That was pretty good for her first call, wasn't it?

[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:37.840]
Well

[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.440]
And he was brief and he was to the point

[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.540]
And he wasn't terminal, he sounded like he was alive almost

[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:43.200]
Yes, he did

[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.340]
Which in Delray is the hell of an accomplishment

[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.600]
It's 11 after 1 at WIOD

[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.680]
Hello, this is Michael Jackson

[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.700]
Urgent you to help stop the spread of social disease

[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:01.860]
Don't risk your life by having a romantic encounter with an unfamiliar queen

[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.020]
I urge you to do like I do

[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.120]
Go it alone

[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:07.040]
But make sure you wear protection

[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:10.020]
That's why I recommend the Michael Jackson glove

[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:12.980]
Worn on either hand, the Michael Jackson glove

[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:16.260]
Added the security and peace of mind that I need to do it myself

[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:20.620]
So remember, before you put it out, put it on and

[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.480]
The Michael Jackson glove

[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.980]
Proving once again that a bird in the hand is better than one in the bush

[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.540]
A battle in frequent models for extra stimulation

[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.440]
Okay, chill

[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.860]
Back to my, I like that pawn shop spot that Joe does

[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:36.540]
That's my favorite

[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.660]
Anyway, on Monday, we got the updates

[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.860]
Because everybody's going on extended holiday now

[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:43.080]
And on busman's holiday

[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.960]
So we have updates for days ahead for all the different shows

[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:53.420]
And on Monday, Steve is going to have Verity Elementary School parent Anaya Mazaros

[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:56.300]
And Rabbi Mordechai Winiars

[00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.040]
Should Christmas be banned?

[00:48:59.320 --> 00:48:59.660]
What?

[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:01.500]
In other words, Christmas carols in the schools

[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:04.820]
And then we're going to have Dampy McCallum on Tuesday

[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:07.060]
Should Goiam celebrate Christmas?

[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.200]
My answer to that is

[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.860]
Or no, should you celebrate Christmas?

[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:12.480]
I got ahead of myself

[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.620]
Should Goiam celebrate Tisha Bob?

[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.080]
Yeah, that's going to be our show

[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:18.340]
We're going to do should Goiam celebrate Tim Hustorum

[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:21.360]
Anyway, it's 12 minutes after what a WIOD

[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.160]
And we'll come back

[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.040]
Yeah, I know Steve needs a lot of Rabbi like we need hemorrhoids

[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.320]
We'll be back right after this

[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:29.860]
Everybody's got a different reason to come to tropical at Calder

[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:31.520]
It's relaxing and exciting

[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.480]
When lose the drawer, I love it

[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:36.200]
The nice place to come to see competitive racing and friendly people

[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.340]
The mini vacation that lasts about four or five hours

[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:41.500]
You have to enjoy it if you come here

[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:42.140]
Thank you, everybody

[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.940]
Come spend your holiday at tropical

[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.600]
Special Thanksgiving post 11 a.m.

[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:50.760]
And how do you get there?

[00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.340]
Right in university right next to Joe Robby Stadium

[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.860]
It's our family track and it's like home

[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.940]
Till he sent back to Cuba is to face death

[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:01.500]
He does this fear that caused the Mario riots

[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:03.760]
Cripling the Atlanta and Oakdale prisons

[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.960]
I'm Nareen Klan

[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:09.720]
A year later, Channel 10, I witness news has troubled to Oakdale, Atlanta and Alabama

[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.420]
To talk with the Cubans, the hostages and officials

[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:16.640]
To find out why the riots won freedom for some, but not for all

[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.140]
Watch the Mario riots, justice for some

[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:22.380]
Tonight at 6, followed by ABC News with Peter Jennings

[00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:25.340]
On South Florida's Choice for News, Channel 10

[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.020]
Most of us have it

[00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:32.920]
The fear, the horror of bath of phobia

[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:38.280]
Bath of phobia, the inexplicable fear that grips homeowners

[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:41.780]
When a guest asks to use the bathroom

[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:46.960]
Are you sick of keeping people out of your bathroom or kitchen because you're embarrassed by the way things look

[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:49.820]
It's time you visited your cure for bath of phobia

[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:51.520]

Dade Plumbing Showroom, located at 975 North Miami Beach, Boulevard 163rd Street and North Miami Beach

[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.800]
Oh my God, the holidays are coming

[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.320]
And along with the holidays comes my mother-in-law

[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.060]
She gave us a lamp

[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:38.060]
Oh, what did I do with it?

[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:39.940]
Oh, here it is in the closet

[00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:43.300]
Oh boy, the lampshade is torn and the lamp doesn't work

[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:46.820]
I guess I better take the lamp over to Alamo's lamps and lampshades

[00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:48.760]
And 1-8185 biscane both, right?

[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.960]
Or the biscane on upper shots?

[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.160]
And see if they can put it in working order

[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.620]
Yeah, I think I'll buy a new lampshade too

[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:59.160]
After all, what a better time to buy a new lampshade than when my lamp is there

[00:51:59.160 --> 00:51:59.780]
Right?

[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:03.360]
Now my mother-in-law won't notice that it had been shoved aside

[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:07.280]
And since I'm going here, I'll take some other lamps and get some new lampshades for them too

[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:10.120]
Maybe I'll find new lamps, features, or accessories

[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:15.600]
Well, here I go to Alamo's lamps and lampshades at 1-8185 biscane Boulevard and the biscane on upper shots

[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.420]
9-3226-11

[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:21.480]
If you're coming into buy a new lampshade, don't forget to bring your lamp

[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:25.980]
After all, you wouldn't buy a hat without your head or would you?

[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:33.440]
Oh, my grand-aire, Neil Rogers, Steve Cain, the greatest talk show lineup in South Florida history is right here

[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:38.700]
Now, more with Neil Rogers, on Newstalk Radio 610, WIOD

[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:45.080]
And by the way, tomorrow, Steve will be off on Turkey Day, which I guess is appropriate, and his guest host will be Norman Kent

[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:46.220]
She is

[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:50.040]
Who is going to be now? Norman is moving from chronic guest to guest host

[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:57.980]
And during the last two hours, animal rights activist Lonnie Wiggand to talk about Turkey's rights

[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:06.220]
Well, it's about time someone did that show

[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:06.480]
Yeah

[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:09.420]
I think it's long overdue, don't you?

[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:14.480]
And there may be one or two other goblers along on it, so you never know when Norman's going to be on some truth

[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:16.560]
We'll tune in and find out that's tomorrow, Steve

[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:20.160]
Steve will be here today, though, with open phones, and he's got a lot of explaining to do, I'll tell you that

[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.260]
116 at WIOD, let's go to West Palm, hello

[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.940]
Hi, Neil, I'm a first time caller

[00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:25.500]
Great

[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.780]
Yeah, Roy, you've had some really bad calls today, I hope I'm not one of them

[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:32.020]
We've had bad calls, now we don't have any bad calls, we had some boring calls

[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:32.980]
Boring calls, what is that?

[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:36.980]
Hey, listen, let me tell you something, wait a minute, this has been a picnic compared to Monday

[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:39.340]
Monday was 100 times worse than the day

[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:45.340]
Yeah, I know, Monday was pretty bad, I tuned in to 10 to 11, and you said the phone calls got bad from 10 to 11 on, so

[00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:47.120]
I might be bringing a bad luck

[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:52.980]
Listen, what I want to tell you is I went someplace yesterday, and I deserve to be abused for it, and I want you to feel free to abuse me

[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.400]
Went to AppCon Center

[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:57.760]
Why do I want to abuse you for that? It's okay to go once

[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:59.000]
Oh man, what a time

[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.280]
Disney World, you can go back to half a dozen, ten times, and AppCon you can go to once

[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:04.960]
Once, what's your complaint?

[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:07.920]
Oh, it was awful, and I paid $28 to get it?

[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:11.300]
Well, you're not going to find any bargains at Disney World, okay, you know that upfront

[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:13.680]
There are no bargains there, they charge you an arm and a leg

[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.060]
Right

[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:18.680]
I mean, when it's like a hundred bucks for kids under six, then you know you're in big trouble to start, okay

[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.200]
It was terrible, right?

[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:26.520]
AppCon is boring, like I said, it's okay to go there once, and it's, you know, you walk around, and you're hoping to get desperately

[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:30.320]
Hoping to find some good food in those international things, and you don't, I mean it's okay

[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:34.140]
But Disney Land is not, Disney World not known for its great food

[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.860]
Did you go to see Michael Jackson?

[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:37.860]
Yeah, I saw that, that wasn't too bad

[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:41.180]
There were people who said this is the fifth time they did it, see that

[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:43.600]
Yeah, there's one or two good things there

[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:44.860]
But it's not exciting

[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:48.400]
I think I liked Spaceship Earth or whatever they call it, it was okay

[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.980]
And well, you know it was raining all day

[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.400]
But you can't blame us for that

[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.640]
Well, I'll bring you for that

[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.240]
No, I've been myself for going

[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:01.900]
Good, well I would lock myself in whips and chains and flagulate myself for hours over it

[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:03.480]
Thank you, thank you

[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:05.260]
It was a very boring place

[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:05.680]
Yeah

[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:07.340]
There was nothing interesting about it all

[00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:10.240]
You could have stuck around here and listen to some of the radio shows in this time

[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.180]
You've been just as bored

[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:14.100]
Well, you've got a great show, but the guy before you and the guy after you

[00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:15.860]
Now come on, don't, don't stop that

[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:18.780]
Would you please, please, I'm begging you, just be nice

[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:22.320]
Well, what can I do? I don't know, Steve came for the show

[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.260]
Be nice, okay? If you like him fine, and if you don't like him,

[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:26.960]
then nobody's forcing you to listen to him

[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:27.980]
And the same with me

[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:29.580]
And I don't, but I listen to you

[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:32.260]
Well, thank you, and you have an ice-cream, don't make that mistake again

[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:32.800]
Never again

[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:33.400]
Bye-bye

[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:35.960]
Okay, now she's off to Bush Gardens, don't I?

[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.380]
Why enjoy Bush Gardens? I think it's an eat place

[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:39.300]
Yeah, it's okay

[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:44.660]
Not as exciting as sitting around over at Crystal on Dale Maverie, but it's second, you know, my second favorite

[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:45.120]
It's nice

[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.340]
Very nice, too

[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:46.960]
Yeah

[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.780]
It's no burn steakhouse

[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.220]
I'm not discussing such things

[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:53.860]
By the way, I like our clock a lot, it's incredible

[00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.760]
119 at WIOD, we have a mobile

[00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:59.000]
Now, with a whining mobile in Boko

[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.240]
Okay, watch out, hello

[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.520]
I wouldn't want to you, Neil, how you doing?

[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:03.080]
Okay

[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.600]
It's Barry, how you doing, Bird?

[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:05.620]
Great, Barry

[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:07.060]
Nick says you're a whiner, Barry

[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:09.780]
No, I'm not a whiner, Bird, I miss you at the screenings

[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:13.600]
Yeah, well, you know, I can go to him again, Barry

[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:16.420]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, what is this? Another personal call?

[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:18.920]
I like this, you know, this is to balance out all your personal

[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:20.260]
I don't have any personal call

[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:23.200]
I never get a chance to talk to Bird, I do want to tell you, Neil, though

[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:25.320]
I'll give you his home phone number, okay?

[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:30.520]
I got it, but listen, Neil, I got to tell you, I used to commute to Boko from Hollywood every day in the morning

[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.180]
And I enjoyed listening to you in the mornings

[00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:32.580]
Yeah

[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:35.340]
Then I moved and I didn't get a chance to listen to you

[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:37.120]
Then you moved from 10 to 2

[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:42.360]
And the only chance I get an enjoyable day on I-95 is listening to you in the bird for a long time

[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.200]
Well, I'll be going, yeah

[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:47.000]
Well, the thing was, Barry, I couldn't go to the screenings when we were working in the morning

[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.680]
Right, because I had to go to bed early, but now I'm back on a normal, I have a normal life again

[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:54.540]
Well, get back on the schedule, but I'm going to do for today

[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.980]
Okay, it's that time of year, isn't it?

[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.960]
Yeah, it's just like, bending over the fence in the back of the road

[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:01.000]
Yeah, it's like bending over

[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.420]
You see that again

[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:05.420]
I'm up in the sea, I'm in Boko bird

[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:06.620]
Oh, you moved, huh?

[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:07.700]
Oh, yeah, we moved up there

[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:09.580]
Yeah, he lives real close to there, he'll be right up

[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:10.720]
I have relatives up there

[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:11.720]
I know, I know

[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:14.680]
Okay, listen, your call has been incredible and have a wonderful role of life

[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.440]
Okay, Neil, best to you and take good care of him for me

[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:18.800]
Okay, thank you so much

[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.560]
Boy, you've got some real winners up

[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:22.960]
Okay, let's go to Miami

[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.560]
Hello, I'm Dr. Jeff Pire

[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:26.180]
Oh, you can say it again, yeah

[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:30.060]
I'll tell you, I have a unique experience just moments ago

[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.280]
When you broke from the news

[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.440]
And when you, I don't know if I was ramped up or ramped down

[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:37.240]
What's that all about?

[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:38.620]
What do you mean?

[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:39.160]
What do you mean by that?

[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:41.080]
When we go from your delay

[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:41.620]
Yeah

[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:42.980]
Woof, that was rough

[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:44.400]
Wow, what happened on the phone?

[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:47.340]
You start, you have an echo effect

[00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:49.160]
And then you feel like you're being stretched apart

[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.060]
It was just incredible

[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:51.800]
Great, that's what happens

[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:53.080]
How do you think we feel in here?

[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.080]
Anyhow, I hear in some kind of an SNM parlour

[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.160]
Just a couple of things

[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:06.840]
First of all, I noticed in this week's Harold in the weekly listing

[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:09.160]
Yes, the Dean is still listed

[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:10.900]
Oh boy

[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.080]
That Harold is so far behind, you know

[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:15.240]
Pretty soon they're going to be putting in listings for Alan Courtney

[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.280]
That's how sharp the Harold is

[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.580]
And they're right on top of it

[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:22.440]
If they never get off of it, they'd be okay

[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:25.580]
Anyhow, that's the one thing

[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:28.520]
Two, I noticed that you've gone the wonderful island dream

[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:29.220]
Yes

[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:31.640]
The last that are dropped in have dropped that

[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:35.680]
That is correct, I pondered as to whether to take that with me and I thought

[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:39.000]
Now let's leave it behind and see if we can't eliminate it from our lives

[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:41.200]
Yeah

[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.860]
No way, we're not bringing that back

[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:46.260]
Holy cow

[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.680]
The sky is falling

[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.700]
See, early in the morning it was okay

[00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:54.440]
Because people weren't awake enough to know whether they were depressed or not

[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:57.060]
But by this time of the day, we don't want to do it to them

[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:58.380]
You can understand that

[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:03.020]
I was listening to some old tapes, monitoring some old tapes to some old shows

[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:07.740]
And I'm still asking myself, does William and his berg need gambler?

[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:08.460]
That's the question

[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:11.580]
That's going to be Steve's topic next Wednesday

[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:14.540]
With an Arab and an Israeli

[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.960]
Finally, something else I've missed

[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.900]
You bring your organ along with you

[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:24.980]
My organ is still, I left it behind

[00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:26.920]
I was wondering, that's a real problem

[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:29.300]
It was a great, it was wonderful

[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:33.580]
Actually here, if we ever get to use the production studio other than coming in on Sunday

[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:36.180]
Which I'm getting tired of doing, but if we ever get any time in there

[00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:40.340]
We've got a library of all kinds of sound effects and they've got their own organ in there

[00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:42.360]
That'll make the other one pale into wind significance

[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:45.060]
But I have to find some time with it

[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:47.600]
I'm going to try the track tomorrow

[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:50.700]
I'd like to listen to you guys, but I'll maybe get the track

[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:52.600]
I'll look for your buddy, a ruster green shirt

[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:54.920]
Yeah, lester doesn't wear a green shirt anymore

[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:57.500]
Just go up there in the Aruf Garden and yell

[00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:59.580]
Just about two minutes before post-time and yell

[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.680]
Lester, he'll laugh on that

[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.800]
He's incredible

[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.040]
If a horse loses, he has the reason

[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.780]
If it wins, he has the reason

[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:07.480]
That is correct

[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.240]
It's incredible

[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.860]
The good old lester, I sure miss him

[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.520]
I'm going to get it back out there one of these days

[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.800]
There's a horse running you reminded me tomorrow

[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.320]
I think it's called Daffy back

[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.540]
That's one of my favorites

[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:19.980]
I'll probably punch my brains on that one tomorrow

[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:21.140]
Be careful, good luck to you

[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:23.660]
In closing, I have one thing left to say to you

[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:24.040]
Good day

[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:28.060]
This is the real bye-good topic, man

[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:29.080]
Okay, see you later

[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.520]
Bye-bye

[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.900]
Okay, 124 at WYD, man

[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.740]
This show today, and you know the amazing part of it to me all day

[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.840]
This is seemed like Friday

[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.140]
Yeah, so I hope you guys have a great weekend

[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:39.840]
And I'll be back

[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:41.760]
Doesn't it seem like Friday?

[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:42.880]
We got to be like Wednesday

[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.940]
It's not like Wednesday at all

[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:47.620]
And a real bitter pill that's going to be hard to swallow

[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:50.260]
When you wake up tomorrow and you realize we got to come in here again

[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:52.380]
But it'll be great, there'll be no traffic

[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.700]
Nobody in the listeners

[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.120]
124 at WYOD

[01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:59.380]
Do you have old steak, Gloria, to be your wife?

[01:00:59.580 --> 01:00:59.860]
I have

[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:04.880]
Here, take a victory drop with instant action

[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.780]
It works on context so you'll get cuff relief

[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:10.300]
You know like a cuff syrup only faster

[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.840]
Take it and answer the man, Harold

[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.600]
You take Gloria as your wife

[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.680]
You know, I'm not really sure

[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.660]
Vicks throw drops with instant action

[01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:21.660]
Because faster relief is better relief

[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:22.620]
Uses directed

[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:26.600]
And for other times when you need vitamin C, try Vicks vitamin C drops

[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.420]
You know what I like about Vicks vitamin C drops?

[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.060]
I don't have to peel them

[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:31.660]
Really?

[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.520]
Before I use to eat oranges to get vitamin C

[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.660]
And I get all the peel parts stuck in my fingernails

[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.840]
Vicks drops are much neater

[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.960]
I pop one delicious drop in my mouth

[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.460]
And I get all the vitamin C of one whole orange

[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:44.780]
Two drops, two oranges

[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:47.800]
All the vitamin C I need without the peel

[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.300]
Anyone who shakes my hand is grateful for that

[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:52.000]
Vicks vitamin C drops

[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.040]
All the vitamin C you need

[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.440]
Without the peel

[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.420]
Rats and sweat, the future

[01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.580]
Oh, a blanket, get your toes to your oven

[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:00.660]
What a great present

[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:02.060]
It's a present with a future

[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:04.280]
And a lot less hassle than our big oven

[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.740]
So it'll get plenty of use now

[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:06.120]
Use

[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:06.920]
Morally

[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.740]
Take my hand, I see this

[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:11.480]
Having a romantic brunch is together making eggs with anything

[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.740]
How waste is your oven?

[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:15.400]
I see you making practice for the kids tomorrow

[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:15.940]
You do

[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.300]
Or sure, Bacle

[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.240]
Nothing's lots of things

[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.220]
Breakfast is kids?

[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:20.740]
Me

[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:22.980]
The versatile toaster oven

[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:24.500]
Breakfast with a future

[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:25.800]
Re-blacken bigger

[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.540]
KB furniture, must raise cash

[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:31.460]
Predators demand payment now

How you doing?

[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:26.860]
What's that?

[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:28.480]
You're working back in Miami again

[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.440]
What does that mean?

[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.600]
I need to get my passport for you know

[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:34.040]
I can't follow this

[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.000]
No, this is

[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.420]
Incoherent sir

[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.460]
I've been in Miami for a long time

[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:41.340]
I've been in various parts of it you know

[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.120]
I know you live in Plantage

[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.600]
That is correct

[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:45.680]
I see I got you

[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:48.580]
I guess

[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:49.760]
Real short

[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.580]
Is that it?

[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:55.600]
What's the Albertsons

[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:56.600]
In Hollywood

[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:56.720]
I remember that

[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:56.720]

[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.780]
When they got little Hollywood and sports

[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:02.040]
And came three minutes back

[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.880]
He said he was hanging out on the car

[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:16.180]
His sister got hit

[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:22.280]
Such and so

[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:24.460]
He , one day in Hollywood

[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:24.480]
And here in Hollywood

[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.160]
Wait on the second

[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:30.520]
listen. Okay. Okay. He stopped me when he ran my life.

[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:36.360]
Nick was right. He comes back. And he goes, I'm going to have to rest you. And I

[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:41.520]
guess the why. And he said, well, you got to take it on the boardwalk, writing your bicycle

[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:45.620]
at night. And you didn't pay it. Yeah. 10 years.

[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:51.500]
Well, the game, well, I was there 32 hours for that. Are you cereal? I believe it.

[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:55.380]
32 hours. Well, I don't teach you to monkey around with that fabulous sunny Rosenberg,

[01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:59.520]
man. No, it was. I didn't have a three wheeler. You know, I can't. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:03.160]
They'll nail your ass for that every time, man. Yeah. Okay.

[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:07.240]
I'm going to go out of that other place. I'm glad you're back to, you know, some of

[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:12.440]
its going to to a real place. You got it. Thanks a lot. I have a good day. Bye-bye. Wow.

[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:20.320]
Let's get our three wheelers out and show him a thing or two. God, don't you just miss

[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:23.840]
Helen Dale? Oh, boy. I have to do another show from the diplomat mall or somewhere in

[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:28.160]
Helen Dale. I'm a real thing to do over there. I don't go to Helen Dale. Oh, you'd go

[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:32.480]
to Helen Dale. You didn't go to the thing with me that day? Oh, yeah. You'd had a great time.

[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:38.080]
And sunny would have come over and shaking your wing. And RJ would have come rushing in there

[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:42.040]
with all looking around behind him, seeing all of his supporters. Both of them. Don't you have

[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.620]
to drive down Helen Dale Beach Boulevard to get to the bowed county fair? Well, you can go that

[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:50.900]
way. Yeah. Yeah. To a federal highway. Well, everybody be careful. Be careful.

[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:58.980]
Just speak. Now as a matter of fact, what you should do is just like close your eyes and put it

[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:04.360]
on auto automatic pilot. What do they call that? I never even use the cruise control. That's it.

[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:08.800]
You can cruise the Boulevard and get it up to about 100. Right right now is the perfect time.

[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:13.440]
Do it. It's one just about 130. Now, and this is J walking time in Helen Dale. Very big after

[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:18.880]
lunch and before the early bird. Now speaking of cars, someone did not show up today.

[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.220]
Well, Spencer didn't make it, but Spencer probably figured because of the weather,

[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:26.320]
he wouldn't show up today. Was that a good excuse? Well, the disappointment. Pretty lame,

[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:30.380]
Spencer. Pretty stinking lame. And it's getting real ponderous, okay?

[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:34.780]
So we'll give him one more chance next week. And if he doesn't show, we'll have to. I don't know

[01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:44.920]
what they'll we'll do. Well, I should go through jiffy car wash or something. April,

were them with your 134 update from the WIOD News Center brought to you by rainbow dodge.

[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:54.400]
These are some of the stories we're following for you at the Sauer. A fire which did $3 million

[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:00.000]
worth of damage to a historic Concord, New Hampshire church is blamed on an Orlando man who's

[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.800]
confessed to setting over 50 blazes for the third time this year. A fraternity at Florida State

[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:09.360]
University has had its charter suspended. And the third largest cocaine bust in Mississippi

[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:14.480]
occurred last night thanks to a tip from Florida officials. The Dow Jones industrial average is

[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:20.520]

[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:25.800]
Radio 610. Fredericks, there's one thing you have to learn. If you're gonna sell cars and trucks

[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:30.880]
at rainbow dodge. What's that bus? We never say no at rainbow. Well, that's easy enough. All right,

[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:36.480]
now repeat after me. We never say no at rainbow. I'm Michael Jackson and I just want to

[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:49.200]
say no. This is Michael Jackson. It's he's got problems. Okay, he really does. He's living with

[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:53.620]
Marlon Brando. Are you serious? Yes. What's Wally Cox going to say about that?

[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:59.600]
When he finds out about, takes a little while for the news to travel to the other side. But when he

[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.740]
hears about it, man, he's gonna be really PO's. Interesting couple though, you think? Yeah,

[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:07.120]
Michael Jackson and Marlon Brando. Maybe Marlon made him an offer he couldn't

[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:07.560]
refute.

[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:13.880]
Okay, moving right along, let's go to Pumbi Chilo.

Well, I'm calling you collect. I'm at work in Pumbi Chilo.

[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:25.680]
Excellent. Now we like that. We like that a lot because this company's got more money than

[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.700]
God and when you make them spend it, I love it.

[01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:30.960]
Now they have you, they have me on call for about 10 minutes since before the break.

[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:31.760]
Good. That's good.

[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:35.820]
I've never, I didn't hear you on say the four pranks because I never listened to them.

[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:37.480]
Well, yeah, you had a lot of company.

[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:41.760]
I uh, I hadn't heard of you till I started listening. I've been listening to IOD for a

[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.940]
couple of years since before the dean and before Paul and before Bill.

[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:47.960]
Yeah, they had quite a parade here and it's time you thought, didn't they?

[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:51.080]
Yeah, that 10 o'clock time stock kept changing every time I heard that another name.

[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.980]
And I used to hear Steve mentioned a lot and I just wanted to tell you that I think you're great

[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:57.040]
and uh, you're really funny.

[01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:59.480]
Thank you. And have a great holiday.

[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.520]
Thanks. Oh, one more thing.

[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:01.160]
Yes, sir.

[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:07.840]
Uh, I know you don't like a request, but uh, however, however,

[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:09.440]
but you know, you're a first time carter.

[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:11.900]
I know I have a week guy who I have no sales resistance in.

[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:12.760]
I thought that might get that in.

[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.680]
If you could sometime before uh, to a clock, uh, play that uh,

[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:19.660]
polka nose, that uh, well, I got news for you.

[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:23.400]
Don't have to ask Carter that because that's my favorite one and it's just, uh, it's the greatest.

[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:24.240]
It's historical.

[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:24.800]
Yeah.

[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:26.100]
All right. Thanks a lot.

[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:27.180]
Wait a minute now. Wait a minute.

[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:30.220]
You got to, you got to stall so I can find it now.

[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.520]
Um, I have to get off the phone and go back to my car.

[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.340]
I'm out on patrol.

[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:36.160]
Just a second.

[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.340]
Wait one second, okay?

[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:38.880]
Okay.

[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:39.500]
One minute.

[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:41.440]
What the hell did I do it?

[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:42.300]
Okay, I'll let you go.

[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:42.780]
We'll see you later.

[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:43.040]
All right.

[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:47.700]
Now if you, uh, if you play your favorite one, visit.

[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:49.180]
Uh, not playing the Andrew sisters.

[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.140]
Uh, darn.

[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:50.660]
Tomorrow.

[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.000]
Oh, okay.

[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:52.900]
Something to look for.

[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:53.200]
Yeah.

[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:54.680]
What the hell would I do with it?

[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:55.260]
The holidays.

[01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:57.440]
The holidays.

[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:58.500]
The holidays.

[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.540]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:02.540]
I'll put little stars on there like a star of David.

[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:07.680]
No, seriously, I put little things on the cards and then that way you can find it fast

[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:09.500]
until somebody puts them in alphabetical order.

[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.660]
I don't want to mention any names.

[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:12.720]
It's 140, 20.

[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:12.900]
Deal.

[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:17.260]
We got a lot of clock watchers out there, which is why we give a lot of time on this here.

[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:17.920]
Radio place.

[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.080]
Hello, I'm Sol.

[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:20.120]
And I'm Harry.

[01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:22.100]
He'd tell you about a special place.

[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:24.180]
Just a short little time.

[01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:51.080]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:51.080]

[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:51.080]

[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:51.080]

[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:51.100]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:51.100]

[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:51.220]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.200]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:53.400]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:53.400]

[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:54.140]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:54.140]

[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:54.140]

[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:54.140]

[01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:08.300]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:08.300]

[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:08.300]

[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:08.300]

[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:08.320]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:08.400]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.080]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:13.880]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:14.680]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:15.940]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:17.320]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:18.560]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.740]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.840]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:50.600]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:50.600]

[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:50.600]

[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:50.600]

[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:50.600]

[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:50.600]

[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:50.600]

[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:50.600]

[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:50.600]

[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:50.600]

[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.780]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:53.780]

[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:53.780]

[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:53.780]

[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:09.980]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:09.980]

[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:09.980]

[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:09.980]

[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:09.980]

[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:09.980]

[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:10.620]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:11.360]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:11.920]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:12.860]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:17.220]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:17.920]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.460]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:23.760]
I'm going to have to start writing on these and go.

[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:24.740]
Why did you do it?

[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.420]
You must have been desperate.

[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:27.980]
I was desperate yet.

[01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:33.020]
Anyway, it wound up that a lot of young couples are getting in there.

[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:35.720]
Now they're trying to evict all the young couples.

[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:36.520]
Isn't that nice?

[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:38.480]
They're all heart, man. Those old farts.

[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:39.180]
They're all heart.

[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.720]
They don't allow you to play the stereo.

[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.400]
I mean, they want mufflers on the toilet.

[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:46.180]
They want mufflers on the toilet.

[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:47.020]
They want mufflers on the toilet.

[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:53.740]
They want mufflers on the toilet.

[01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:55.400]
They want to get my mother in a hot water with her neighbors.

[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:56.500]
But I'm going to say it again.

[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.700]
She's got some neighbors who walk.

[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.860]
You think that there was a herd of elephants in the building.

[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:04.440]
I mean, they just every step is like life and death.

[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:05.760]
And every time I go over there for dinner.

[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:07.640]
And you know, we have a wonderful dinner.

[01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:09.780]
And you sit down on the sofa and you rely.

[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:10.660]
Try to relax.

[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:12.580]
And I don't know how she handles it.

[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.240]
Boy, she must wear earplugs when I'm out there.

[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:15.640]
Because it's just enough to drive you nuts.

[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:17.780]
And these are old people. These aren't young people.

[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:18.740]
I agree with you.

[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:23.960]
It's a matter of fact, one thing that's really getting me is there are some old people that are...

[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.320]
And I agree with you.

[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.740]
There's an awful lot of nice ones there.

[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.440]
But there are some that are just incredible.

[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.920]
And I have one downstairs for me that they just write office while she's a crazy old lady.

[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:37.480]
That one's in state. But the young people, if they make a sound, you know, goodbye.

[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.600]
Yeah, that's right. They're under a hundred, man. Get rid of them and get them out.

[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.440]
Yeah, and I don't... I'm Jewish.

[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.000]
So this is an anti-semitic.

[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:47.540]
But when I put on my Yiddish Imam, I can crank that sucker off to 125.

[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:49.240]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:51.360]
And that's the God's honest truth.

[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.600]
Yeah, if I put anything else on.

[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:56.760]
So I want to dedicate, if you don't mind a suggestion, some Thanksgiving music.

[01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:59.860]
If you still have it like Fairfax Avenue and the Kosher Cowboy.

[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:03.080]
Oh, yeah. We got that for tomorrow. We'll play it on Thanksgiving Day.

[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:04.760]
Just for your crown over there.

[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:08.120]
And have a happy Thanksgiving. And Glenn, I love you till you're great.

[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:10.160]
Thanks a lot. See you later. Bye-bye.

[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:11.040]
Bye. Good luck to you.

[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.300]
Because it sounds like he's going to need it.

[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:15.780]
Yeah. Now listen, if you're under a hundred, don't move into any of those mausoleums.

[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:18.980]
Okay, any of those condo-commando outfits. Forget it.

[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:22.940]
I feel sorry for him because I just realized how miserable I would be if I was in his city.

[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.160]
Oh, man. Terrible.

[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:25.260]
Unbelievable. Terrible.

[01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:28.320]
And they just... they look at you with that hostile look and they want you out.

[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:29.780]
Out. Get out of here.

[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:32.060]
And don't ever come back. That kind of thing.

[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.360]
Just kind of the way we feel about some of them.

[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:37.060]
Miami, hello.

[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:38.520]
Yeah, he don't think it's going.

[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:39.700]
Okay. This is Paul.

[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:41.440]
Hey, Paul. Hey, how's it going, Bert?

[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:43.980]
Okay. That was a great show you had there, you just see.

[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:45.920]
Yeah, I was standing on there. Yes, it was.

[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:47.520]
Yeah, I appreciate that.

[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:48.540]
Let me ask you a question.

[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.000]
Yes, Paul. What's the question?

[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:51.800]
Everybody else got a question or a problem?

[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:52.700]
Well, I'm a story today.

[01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:53.340]
Okay.

[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:54.780]
Okay, I live down in Kendall.

[01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:56.260]
And maybe Bert will be all-ass.

[01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:58.080]
Is there any good pizza places down here?

[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:03.300]
Well, I'll tell you one, but Neil vehemently disagrees with me, but I think...

[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:03.940]
Oh, boy.

[01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:07.880]
Well, I'll tell you another one, then.

[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:09.580]
You're in Kendall, right?

[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:10.880]
Yeah, I heard about Miami's one.

[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:16.680]
Well, you know, over on Bird Road is Frankies, which has been there for a million years, which is real famous.

[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.040]
Wait a minute. Let me interrupt.

[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.640]
Nick is asking a question here on the screen.

[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:22.840]
Can my caller not use the inane term? How is it going? No.

[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:23.340]
Okay.

[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:26.680]
They cannot do that. They must say that. That's part of it. We've trained them.

[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.040]
I think Nick's going to mic in there.

[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:29.440]
Nick wants to do his own show.

[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:31.720]
The next question is, oh, yeah. He wants his own show.

[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.080]
And maybe tomorrow we'll give him an opportunity.

[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:34.760]
Great.

[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:39.140]
Everybody talks about that pop of VIX, which is across the street from the town of Country Mall.

[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:40.840]
Yeah, I had it there. That's a really good stuff.

[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:46.960]
Yeah. I don't know if this is far south enough for you, but that place on Flagler Street, the pizza loft that runs the other day is excellent.

[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:47.800]
Flagler, okay.

[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:51.440]
That's on Flagler Street out, not too far from the Palmetto. It's outstanding.

[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:52.920]
Okay. I'll check out that place.

[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.420]
Now, shall I tell you my favorite and you will pass out on the floor and make guttural noise?

[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:58.060]
Oh, here we go ahead. Go ahead.

[01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:59.920]
Little Caesars on Dixie Highway.

[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:01.040]
Oh, yeah. I've been there.

[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:04.260]
It's not in the chain. It's an independent little caesars.

[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.520]
Yeah, they're pretty good.

[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:06.940]
Yeah. That's my favorite.

[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:07.300]
Yeah.

[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:07.840]
Okay.

[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.180]
Okay. What are you thinking?

[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:11.920]
My brother's eating at the U.M.

[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.040]
And I don't know if you could call him a douchebag.

[01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:14.380]
Yeah.

[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:17.180]
Well, I'll be honest with you, we haven't had any other request for that.

[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.680]
So, because you're such a good guy, what's his name?

[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:20.100]
Andy.

[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:23.300]
Oh, Andy, if he is at U of M, he definitely is a douchebag.

[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:25.060]
I guess he speaks for itself. Good luck to you, Andy.

[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:25.480]
Okay.

[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:26.640]
And don't forget to run up the score.

[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.200]
Okay. See you later.

[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:28.680]
Thanks a lot.

[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.940]
Bye-bye. Now, they wouldn't do that with that. The U of M?

[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.520]
No. Run up the score on anybody.

[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:36.460]

the answer that is if you like boobs a lot, you would love to work in where we just came from.

what you're going to do, then check out EFMI, the Entertainment Institute right here in Miami.

[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:49.480]
With cooler weather, many people want to button up their addicts by closing all the vents.

[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:54.640]
When I tell them not to, they think I am crazy. What you don't think about is that if your

[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:59.920]
addict is closed, it's going to trap humanity. As the surfaces in the addict get colder than the

[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:05.300]
air, condensation occurs and these surfaces start to sweat. That moisture can cause riding

[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:09.260]
among the wood parts of the house. It can also cause fungus to start to grow.

[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:13.800]
Metal parts can start to rust. If the moisture drips down on the insulation,

[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:18.960]
the R value is greatly diminished. Enough moisture can drip to soak through the sheet rock

[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:24.240]
of the ceilings of your house below. So you see you need ventilation in the winter just as much

[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:29.000]
as you do in the summer. And don't think about closing just part of the vents. You need a certain

[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.500]
amount of vents that allow fresh air to come in and other parts of the system to exhale the moist air.

[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:40.400]
Remember, paint, roofing insulation, sheathing wood and metal can be affected by your ventilation

[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:48.000]
or lack of it. I'm Al Carroll, the super handyman. Al Carroll wants to closing up addict vents for the winter.

[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:56.140]
UM Head Football coach Jimmy Johnson. Every one of you know this better than anybody in the world.

[01:26:57.220 --> 01:27:03.820]

[01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:08.940]
You know what it means to really love a team.

[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.360]
To beat up.

[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:11.680]
And have fun.

[01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:15.780]

What are you going to do? Run up the score over the weekend now?

[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.300]
No, I didn't. I didn't.

[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:38.660]
I didn't joke Jimmy. Don't get all upset now. It's just a joke.

[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:40.840]
I didn't know you would have popular over guy.

[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:41.580]
By what?

[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:47.100]
Um, I started listening to you when you came to WIOD. I never heard you before.

[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:47.980]
Oh, come on now.

[01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:53.460]
I swear. The only time I heard of you was, uh, I used to listen to Steve at two o'clock.

[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:55.620]
Yeah, he talked about me incessantly.

[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:57.760]
Like he was just a rip you. Yeah.

[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000]
And it's a good thing I didn't take everything he said seriously.

[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:01.900]
That's correct.

[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:05.060]
You, uh, you know, bird got a pretty good show there.

[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:06.740]
Yeah, not great, but it's pretty good.

[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.640]
Um, I called Steve once and I got through in two minutes.

[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:12.960]
That's what kind of threw me off. Wait, so long.

[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:14.780]
What does that mean?

[01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:18.080]
No, I'm just saying how long how long did you take you to get through an issue?

[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:19.820]
Probably about 45 minutes.

[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:20.840]
All right. Let's hear it.

[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.660]
The phones have been great this, uh, today.

[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:24.000]
I don't know what's going on.

[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:26.500]
Listen, I think you and bird have a really great show.

[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:27.820]
Great show now. It's pretty good.

[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:28.820]
Well, it's pretty good.

[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:29.180]
It's a good stuff.

[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:29.680]
Not just that.

[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:30.440]
Okay, excellent.

[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:31.060]
We're delighted.

[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:32.400]
Keep up the good work.

[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:32.800]
Okay.

[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:35.720]
And that's song you, but I'm not making a request.

[01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:37.580]
No, even on the first time call.

[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:38.140]
That's correct.

[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:43.840]
And especially since we are out of time, I know you're at, but I just want to say that song about Elvis's daughter, Lisa Marie.

[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:44.740]
Yeah, we just played it.

[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:45.840]
Yeah, we'll play it again tomorrow.

[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.880]
I listen. You guys have a nice Thanksgiving.

[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:48.560]
You too.

[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:49.340]
Take care.

[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:49.820]
Boy, boy.

[01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:50.400]
Bye, bye.

[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:51.140]
Wow.

[01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:52.200]
Well, tomorrow is Thanksgiving.

[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.480]
So we're going to play everything tomorrow.

[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:55.680]
We're going to play everything we can get our hands on.

[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:57.080]
I'm serious.

[01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:57.700]
Why not?

[01:28:58.140 --> 01:28:59.520]
Well, we'll see what we'd like to do.

[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:00.680]
That stuff on a whole of days.

[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.640]
And then you can get your cassette recorders going.

[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:05.960]
If you got an IQ over two and you don't have to keep calling in and bugging us.

[01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:08.040]
And you can record all the stuff you want.

[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:12.040]
You can listen to it in your car or in your house or in the john or wherever you want to.

[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:12.760]
Okay.

[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:13.360]
Oh, well,

[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.400]
get out of our lives and off of our backs.

[01:29:17.660 --> 01:29:18.300]
It's 155.

[01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:20.140]
What are you looking at me like that for?

[01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:21.140]
What kind of a look was that?

[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:22.040]
Just a little joke.

[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:23.220]
Boy, he's getting real.

[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:25.680]
Well, he's touchy after that episode yesterday.

[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:26.280]
He's getting a little.

[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.780]
He's been fine up till now, but he's a little bit touchy today.

[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:31.740]
After yesterday's little comfort Thompson.

[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:32.960]
Five o'clock hour.

[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:36.900]
But we'll get all the explanation about that in the upcoming Steve Kane show.

[01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:37.280]
Won't we?

[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:38.360]
Or I'm sure sorry.

[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:38.980]
I miss that.

[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:39.320]
Yeah.

[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:40.360]
I really did.

[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:42.260]
I had two or three calls at home like frantic.

[01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:42.500]
Bye.

[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:43.860]
You hear what happened?

[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:46.500]
I said, just go get a life and leave me alone.

[01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:47.620]
Okay.

[01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:48.760]
Sunrise hung up, huh?

[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:49.420]
Boy, thank God.

[01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:50.160]
Oh no, they're on eight.

[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:50.860]
Hello.

[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.680]
I want a meal.

[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:55.120]
Hey, no.

[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:56.140]
Yeah, what do you want?

[01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:57.340]
J from J and Scott.
