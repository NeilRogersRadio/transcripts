When ten o'clock come I got to listen to me, I want, miss, I'll be who?

[00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.380]
When ten o'clock come I got to listen to me, lots of people bringing in the foodie loves.

[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.360]
Ten o'clock come I got to listen to me, like six puts seven puts eight puts theves.

[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:16.160]
Ten o'clock come I got to Listen to me, I want, I want, miss, I'll be missed, I'll be who?

[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.700]

[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.540]

Good boy, tha-

[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.160]
Ha-hmm, oh, oh

[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.340]
Then, one thing here….

[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.700]
Paaaaa..

[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.480]
Yeah, you know what they say, don't you?

[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.100]
Huh?

[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.440]
What goes around comes around?

[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.620]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.620]

[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.900]
Next slide, me right?

[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.440]
I think there are a lot of fun liquors out there.

[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.960]
There are a lot of fun liquors out there.

[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.220]
I think there are a lot of fun liquors out there.

[00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.900]
Me right.

[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.080]
Doose bags.

[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.880]
Doose bags.

[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.640]
Doose bags.

[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.360]
Doose bags.

[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.160]
Doose bags.

[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.160]
Doose bags.

[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.480]

[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.160]
Doose bags with all their advice?

[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.120]
Doose bags.

[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.020]
Doose bags.

[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.300]
Doose bags.

[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.120]
Doose bags.

[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.120]
Doose bags.

[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.660]
Doose bags.

[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.680]
Doose bags.

[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.480]
Doose bags.

[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.100]
Doose bags.

[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.960]
Doose bags.

[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.160]
Doose bags.

[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.160]

[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.160]

[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.620]
Doose bags.

[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.820]
I'm OK.

[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.160]
Doose bags.

[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.060]

[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.440]
Doose bags.

[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.020]
Doose bags with all their advice.

[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.240]
Doose bags.

[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.300]

[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.060]
Eeeemh!

[00:02:39.620 --> 00:03:02.440]
Hey Elud, time is

[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:10.140]
What is that? What is that? What is that? What is that? Anything you want to enjoy is again the law.

[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.720]
Okay, it's 11.08 at W.I.O.D., but that's a real masterpiece. That's something that will end there.

[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.220]
The anals of broadcast history for a long time.

[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.780]
It's great. And the mail is here and Rich is having an nervous breakdown.

[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.480]
He's actually crumbling before our very eyes. There are at least two cartons of mail here today.

[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.940]
Most of them tapes with checks. And I would say we did pretty well today.

[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:47.040]
Now what do we have? We had 20,669. So we need about 4,300 today in Amar-O-Lalat.

[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.500]
It's going to be tough to make 25,000. Nothing went surprised me at this point.

[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.640]
Anyway, we were speaking earlier to Nick and he said that he would make up the difference whatever it is.

[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.460]
So if we fall at 1,500,000, sure, no problem.

[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.020]
Okay, let's start in sunrise. Hello.

[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.840]
Hi, Neil. Happy holidays to you and the bird. I was saying to you.

[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.060]
I love your show. You guys are terrific.

[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.660]
I know.

[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]
I live in sunrise now and I'm trying to get out of this blue-hit town. Please.

[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.680]
Oh, it is such a sad state of the city. I'm a couple of locks from the lakes.

[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.180]
A couple of locks?

[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.200]
Oh, no. You don't know what I know. I have got to get out of here.

[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.100]
So what do I do? I go take a ride out to Pemberpine and I'm looking at these houses in the middle of nowhere.

[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.400]
They call it chapel trails. They're not kidding.

[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.100]
I figured that's far enough away from sentry village. From sunrise lakes I can be alone.

[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.100]
Let me go check it out. So they have nice homes. Everything's peachy.

[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160]
I said before I move here, let me go to one of their city commission meetings.

[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.520]
Because you know how sunrise is. I don't want anything remotely similar.

[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.220]
So I go to Pemberpine City Commission meeting last night and bring dead Creetans.

[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.300]
It's not the word. These elected officials are an embarrassment to society.

[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.640]
Nobody knew what was going on. It was a three-ring circus and ringleader was Mayor Flanagan.

[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.980]
Three-ringed Sookers, huh?

[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.960]
Oh my God. What a fear.

[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.820]
Why don't you come live in beautiful plantation with those of a civilized folks?

[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.840]
Is that where I need to come? I don't know. It's too close to sunrise.

[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.540]
No, no. I'll just don't venture north of Sunrise Boulevard.

[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.320]
That's all. We got a beautiful new pubics there on Cleary Boulevard and everything is wonderful.

[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.960]
The one on Nod Hill Road there.

[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.480]
Whatever it is, Yanab Hill.

[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.740]
Okay. That discivilized out that you're sure.

[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]
Yes, it's great.

[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.980]
We will have a few 90-year-old bag boys but nothing is perfect.

[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.220]
Oh my God. Well, I'm going to have to take a look because I have renamed Pemberpine's Pemberpines Pemberpines and I really can't handle this.

[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.540]
This is ridiculous. I mean, it was unbelievable.

[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.000]
Yeah. Have you ever watched Pemberpines Pemberpines?

[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.760]
I lived in Pemberpines for two years so I'm not unfamiliar.

[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.060]
Although I lived there were all young people. We used to throw the old people out.

[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.580]
Oh, God.

[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.640]
We saw anybody over 30. We'd put them on a bus.

[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.240]
Well, the plantations were happening, huh?

[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.680]
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.320]
You know, we got the new Macy's shopping center and a brownered mall and, you know...

[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.160]
Again, I hear they're building something with floorgrass mall that's going to be...

[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.100]
The floorgrass, yeah, with a lot of frogs in it, yeah.

[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.340]
No, they are. That's on our West Sunrise.

[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.500]
Yes, it's supposed to be the biggest mall in the south's eastern portion of the continent.

[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.080]
That is correct. We just loads this stuff.

[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.220]
We just need another mall. We've got this fashion mall.

[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.220]
And a few more strip shopping centers would be good too.

[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.080]
Yes, of course.

[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.960]
Now, check it out. I'm telling you. Plantation is where it's at.

[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.460]
Okay. Well, if you say so, Neil, I'm going to look into that.

[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.360]
I thought it was too close to sunrise so I wanted to go farther away.

[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.800]
No, no, we're putting up a wall anyway starting after the holidays.

[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.900]
Okay, good. Tell me when you're going to start building.

[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.760]
I'll come out there with my construction uniform.

[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.880]
Okay, good luck to you, dear.

[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.060]
Okay. Bye-bye.

[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.140]
Bye-bye.

[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.400]
A lot of people bet the lottery.

[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.840]
A lot.

[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.980]
Not too many wins.

[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.920]
Oh!

[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.760]
Hi, this is Michael Jackson.

[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.460]
I just want to say hi to all my fans.

[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.940]
I love each and every one of you.

[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.420]
And I want you to know that I gained ten pounds.

[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.520]
Yeah, it's right now. I weigh 53.

[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.380]
Well, Indole, be happy to hear that.

[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.360]
It's 1114 at WIOD.

[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.520]
And I want to thank Larry and Diane and Jensen Beats,

[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.620]
$300 check for Kamala's house.

[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.520]
Gosh.

[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.240]
Unbelievable. And they've got a great line in here.

[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:22.600]
It says the number one rule for condo living is it's easier to get forgiveness than it is to get permission.

[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.140]
Which I think speaks for itself, right?

[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.120]
Okay, it's quarter after 11. Steve will be along at two.

[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.060]
I have no idea what he's doing.

[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.600]
I don't have any of my sheets out today.

[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.940]
I feel like a naked clansman.

[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.840]
My sheets are all someplace else.

[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.160]
Is he got a guest today?

[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.900]
Nick is looking at the house.

[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.520]
He does. He does have a guest.

[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.000]
He's bringing it in here, which is really going to be ponderous by the time it gets in here.

[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.100]
Well, I can't wait.

[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.900]
But it's important, okay?

[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.000]
In fact, oh, I know what it is.

[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.540]
Today is one of those atheists.

[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.020]
No, it is.

[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.860]
A Reverend Dwight Porter, who's only been on the show 400 times this month.

[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.420]
And atheist John O'Neill.

[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.120]
And it says on the sheet here, an atheist debate just in time for Christmas.

[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.760]
And then on sports talk, and the six o'clock hour sunny, you'll be on live from Hawaii.

[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:08.360]
Hmm.

[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.640]
Now, let's see.

[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.200]
That means it's, that's okay, because it'll be around noon.

[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:12.800]
Mm-hmm.

[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.080]
Out there, it's six hours different.

[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:19.760]
And then at seven o'clock, Joe will be here with Gary Stevens, the guru of U of M's offense.

[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.740]
What a way to put it.

[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.220]
So that's coming up at six tenths.

[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.620]
All right, let's go to Miami.

[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.020]
Hello.

[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.220]
Yeah, hi.

[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.920]
Um, you show is really great.

[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:31.600]
I love it.

[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.040]
I know.

[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.100]
Except one thing.

[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.860]
Your sidekick's a real pot.

[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.500]
He does the worst Ed McMahon impressions I've ever seen.

[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:38.460]
Ho, ho, ho.

[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.040]
You know what I mean?

[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.000]
If I kill him.

[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.040]
Well, I'll tell you what, you know, when you have your own show, you have any sidekick you want on.

[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.680]
Yeah, but I'm saying he can't, he contributes nothing to your show.

[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.340]
Your show would be a lot better with a better sidekick.

[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.340]
Sorry, but.

[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.060]
You're talking to the sidekick right now, face to face.

[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.620]
Don't talk about me like I'm the third person, huh?

[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.460]
Phone to phone.

[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:01.560]
Okay.

[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.440]
Phone to phone, yeah.

[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.540]
Well, um.

[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.940]
All you do is laugh.

[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.740]
Well, uh, do you think you could do better?

[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.060]
Better job.

[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.200]
You know, a kneel's not here like when he goes on vacation or he's sick.

[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.820]
Like I do the show myself.

[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.080]
Would you like to do that?

[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.140]
Here we go.

[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:18.500]
Huh?

[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.420]
Personally, that's not my field of interest.

[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.760]
Uh-huh, then why are you criticizing me then?

[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.120]
Because when he is there, you contribute nothing.

[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.080]
Boy, what a Christmas spirit this guy is in.

[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.840]
Well, thanks a lot for your real, uh, a helpful suggestion.

[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.460]
Can I contribute more to the show and you'll be a lot better?

[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.640]
Can I ask you a question?

[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.240]
Yeah.

[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:40.960]
How old are you?

[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.100]
21.

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.880]
No.

[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:45.680]
Yeah.

[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.400]
21.

[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.760]
What's your first name?

[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.040]
Huh?

[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.780]
Wait, what?

[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.120]
What's your first name?

[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.000]

[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:53.980]
Frankie?

[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:54.580]
Yes.

[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:55.860]
Yeah.

[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:57.900]
Okay, Frankie.

[00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.060]
You've been a real help.

[00:09:59.280 --> 00:09:59.920]
Yeah, there he goes.

[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.220]
Sheer, I couldn't figure out I was a guy or a girl.

[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:02.820]
I think it was a girl.

[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.840]
It sounded like a girl to me.

[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.300]
Well, that's why I asked the name and I thought they would clear it up and I was Frankie and I.

[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:09.880]
Frankie and I.

[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.660]
Frankie, I.E.

[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.600]
Obviously, it was a girl.

[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.380]
That's a girl if I ever heard a girl.

[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.060]
Even if it is a guy, it's a girl.

[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:17.460]
Mm-hmm.

[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.180]
Yeah, I understand.

[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:18.760]
No question.

[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.020]
Wellington, hello.

[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:20.680]
Hey, Neil.

[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:21.140]
Yeah.

[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:21.840]
How you doing today?

[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.800]
Just great.

[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:23.920]
I'm a pulled.

[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.200]
You're a pulled?

[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:25.840]
I'm a pulled.

[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:26.680]
I cannot believe this.

[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.140]
I went through the pole plaza at Lake Worth and the lady gave me my 20 cents change in pennies.

[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.300]
Well, that was probably a little Christmas gift for you, sir.

[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.620]
I cannot handle this.

[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.740]
This is not right.

[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.020]
I demand my freedom.

[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:40.520]
Yeah.

[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.680]
Well, good luck to you.

[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.300]
Well, okay.

[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:42.960]
Also, a bird.

[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:43.180]
How you doing?

[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.360]
Just if you get out of that God for a second, everybody wants to go to Lake Worth anyway.

[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.340]
Need serious help.

[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.780]
You're not going to blow your brains out, are you?

[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.200]
No, I'm not.

[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.980]
I'm definitely coming back to Miami where I belong.

[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:51.700]
Okay.

[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.020]
Well, where are you belonging, Miami?

[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:53.600]
Look at this.

[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.020]
We've honored Reagan's door mat.

[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.580]
Well, that's cute.

[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:57.520]
That's cute.

[00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:58.720]
Bird, how you doing?

[00:10:59.060 --> 00:10:59.760]
Well, fine.

[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:00.260]
Fine.

[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.620]
Neil, a few weeks back, I'm just being reading chords with the other stations.

[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.940]
Means a million and one.

[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.300]
Things you have to read real quick.

[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.520]
With their old classic rock and roll.

[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:11.100]
Yeah.

[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.700]
Hey, the new billboards are.

[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.580]
I'm glad you mentioned that.

[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.660]
With the new billboards are up, they finally got my name off their station.

[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.280]
Thank God.

[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:17.660]
God.

[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.240]
And the one that I saw on I-95, you can't even see the Zeta.

[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.240]
I mean, most of it is off.

[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.660]
Seriously, it's off the billboard.

[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.260]
That's good.

[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.300]
You only have three half of that time because it was unfortunate that I was sitting on a stoplight.

[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.060]
And if you read it, you'll see Elton John's name twice.

[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.380]
You'll see the doors twice.

[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:33.660]
You'll see the doors twice.

[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.200]
You'll see the doors.

[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.060]
Well, that's because they play such a limited number of artists.

[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.760]
They couldn't fill up the whole billboard.

[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.440]
They must be a real bunch of douchebags over there.

[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.040]
That is correct.

[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.000]
With a couple of exceptions.

[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.300]
There are a couple of nice people over there, but they'll get out.

[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:44.760]
OK.

[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.540]
One last thing, Neil.

[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:45.880]
Yeah.

[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:46.420]
Good day.

[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.000]
OK.

[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.180]
Excellent call.

[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.340]
1119 at WIOD.

[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.760]
Yesterday I had a great experience on the turnpike speaking of that getting off at the sunrise exit.

[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.580]
Or, no, getting my ticket.

[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.040]
I'm sorry.

[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.000]
When I got on at the Golden Glades Interchange, the young blonde lady was not there.

[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.360]
Boy, are you luck.

[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.160]
Her sidekick.

[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.000]
The one that she always talks to, she was there.

[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.320]
And she was actually facing the motorists.

[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.200]
And she was handing out the tickets very quickly.

[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.800]
And the act of like she knew what she was doing.

[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.080]
You mean the one who usually just laughs?

[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.180]
The idiot who just laughs and has nothing to show.

[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.240]
And I said to her, you better get a new sidekick.

[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.800]
Because that sidekick a year is that nothing to your show.

[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.880]
And she said, well, maybe that's your opinion.

[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.900]
And I said, are you a girl or a gun?

[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.440]
That's for you to figure out.

[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.720]
And I said, El Paso.

[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.720]
And she said, just take a quick left.

[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.540]
20 past 11, we have an open line in Palm Beach.

[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.400]
655 WIOD.

[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:46.300]
You know, I saw, you never guess who I saw in a hall briefly as I was going down the hall there during the New York.

[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:47.040]
Yes.

[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.760]
Tom Denibar was in a hall again.

[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.680]
I'm not going to have any other problem again.

[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:56.640]
Another little pro, every account, this man, including accounts I brought over here that have never had any problem before,

[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.240]
who get tremendous response with Tom.

[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.760]
If they don't have a problem, he convinces them that they do have one.

[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.080]
Okay.

[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:12.120]
Some day, no, seriously, if I live long enough, some day I will pass this man in the hall or he will come into this room and he will tell me something good.

[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.880]
There will not be a problem.

[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:14.940]
It'll be great news.

[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.920]
There won't be anything complex or confusing.

[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.440]
Or I mean, I want to tell you, pizza loft is a great place.

[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.100]
And I'm delighted to have him as a sponsor.

[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.860]
Jeff is a super guy who has brought us food and he's got a heart of gold and their food is tremendous.

[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.660]
His lasagna is the best in the world.

[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.000]
Their pizza is super sensational.

[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.860]
And I'm delighted to have him on.

[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:38.560]
And what he has done to them with that multi lasagna, I mean, that is so, even I haven't got any idea.

[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.180]
Even they over there don't understand what he's talking about.

[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:41.480]
Okay.

[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.380]
So you're right, Tom.

[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:50.700]
We are going to make you into a celebrity into a monster in your own time from the Larry Kent School of Radio Giants.

[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.700]
It's 21 past 11.

[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.160]
And here's a, what is that?

[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.060]
Why are you giving me cassettes?

[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.280]
Oh, there's stuff on this.

[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.120]
Freeway and spigot.

[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:01.700]
What?

[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.160]
No.

[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.060]
Oh, no, this is a tape for dubs.

[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.740]
It says, what does that mean?

[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.660]
What about freeway and spigot?

[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.260]
Didn't someone call and say they can't hear you?

[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:11.520]
Yeah.

[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.620]
This is Neil Bitts, it says on it.

[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.740]
Or Neil Bitts, I'm not sure what that is.

[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.240]
And that one says for Bitts, how long is that cassette?

[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:20.500]
90.

[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.080]
Well, that's what that is.

[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.540]
This is mine, okay?

[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.620]
It says, and closes my check for the criminal sounds and two cassettes.

[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.880]
One is for your Bitts.

[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.080]
The other is for you to make a copy.

[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.920]
Oh, please return both of them.

[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.860]
Freeway and spigot.

[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.100]
And keep up the good work.

[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.640]
Well, how the hell are we going to do that?

[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.540]
It has to be.

[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.020]
Oh, thanks so much.

[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:44.520]
Thanks a heap.

[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.160]
Oh, well, they made it so complicated.

[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.680]
Maybe we can get Tom Denberg in here to straighten this out.

[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:49.040]
Yeah.

[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.640]
I don't have you so confused by the end of the hour.

[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.300]
That you'll be blowing your brains up.

[00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.560]
I'm not making that up either.

[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.100]
That's true.

[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:00.580]
I know.

[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.180]
It's true.

[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.500]
Okay, it's 22 past the hour, Frank, with a cold in Palm Beach, Hilo.

[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.440]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.300]
Okay, Frank.

[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:13.700]
I heard your call the other day when Sonny called in and matched your $1,000.

[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:14.580]
Yeah.

[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.120]
I'll match your $1,000.

[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:16.600]
Great.

[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.280]
Thank you, Frank.

[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.620]
And if you don't make your 25, I'll cover the difference.

[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.600]
I'm not too...

[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.180]
Premendous.

[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:24.600]
What a guy.

[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.680]
You know what this is.

[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.020]
No.

[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:27.960]
You don't know this.

[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:28.380]
No.

[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.900]
Well, you got a bad cold.

[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:35.060]
I have a terrible cold, but I was one of your sponsors on 940 when you were there.

[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.420]
You came over and sat in my office and we had a nice long talk.

[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:45.280]
I don't want to identify myself on the air because every time I do, I get a lot of hate calls.

[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:45.920]
Really?

[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:47.920]
That's a surprise.

[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.780]
I thought my favorite song is the Vatican Ragnac.

[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.040]
Great.

[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:53.880]
Well, listen to your...

[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.340]
So you should be able to know who that is from that.

[00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.280]
But anyway, your board on...

[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.320]
I told him what I was.

[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.200]
Mm-hmm.

[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.980]
The check will be dropped over there tomorrow.

[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:03.640]
Thank you, Frank.

[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:04.360]
I appreciate it.

[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.160]
I hope you're feeling better.

[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:05.740]
Oh, thank you.

[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.140]
Oh, last three days have been hell.

[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:07.700]
I'll bet.

[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.100]
Thank you.

[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.320]
Just wait till the next three.

[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.520]
Thanks a lot.

[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:10.900]
Goodbye.

[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:11.300]
Bye.

[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:11.980]
That's great.

[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.180]
23 past 11 at WIOD.

[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.340]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.200]
If you move quickly now, we're Frank just hung up.

[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.320]
And I really do appreciate it.

[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:18.820]
That's great.

[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.260]
655WIOD and we'll be right back.

[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:21.780]
D.

[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.120]
First you get down on your knees.

[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.060]
Fiddle with your rosaries.

[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.120]
Bow your head with great respect.

[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.500]
And chain you flex, chain you flex, chain you flex.

[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.840]
To whatever steps you want.

[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.180]
If you have clear them with the pontiff.

[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.580]
Everybody say his own career.

[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.760]
He lays on doing the vending and riding.

[00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.940]
Get in line in that processional step into that small confessional.

[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.740]
They're the guy who's got religion.

[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.160]
I'll tell you if your sins are original.

[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.360]
If it is, try playing it safer.

[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.420]
Drink the wine and chew the wafer.

[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.680]
Two or six eight.

[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.920]
Climb the trampolabespan she is.

[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.240]
And get down upon your knees.

[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.420]
Fiddle with your rosaries.

[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.060]
Bow your head with great respect.

[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:21.820]
And chain you flex, chain you flex.

[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:22.640]
To whatever steps you want.

[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:22.980]
To whatever steps you want.

[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.440]
Take a cross on your abdomen.

[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.620]
When in Rome do like a Roman, our Bain Maria.

[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:28.860]
She's good to see you.

[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.700]
Can't explain the thought of your mind.

[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:31.480]
I'm gonna do it.

[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.080]
I'm gonna do it.

[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:32.640]
I'm gonna ride.

[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:32.640]

[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:32.900]
I'm gonna ride.

[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:37.620]
I'm gonna ride.

[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:37.620]

[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.880]
Okay, Frank, that's for you, baby.

[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.000]
27 past 11 at WIOD.

[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.300]
And we have a little crisis here again today.

[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.960]
A very minor not related to the one we had yesterday.

[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.100]
One related to food.

[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.000]
And we just had a fist fight with Sharon,

[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.980]
who was acting a little surly this morning.

[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.700]
But I understand she's a little under the weather still.

[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.120]
And she's acting a little hysterical.

[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.280]
And we forced her to call Flores for our lunch.

[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.120]
And Rich was gonna go pick it up.

[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.540]
And as it turns out, nobody answers the phone.

[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.740]
And that seems fairly logical to me,

[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.260]
because it is three days before Christmas.

[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.900]
Well, anyway, see Carmine,

[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.420]
today is Thursday.

[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.520]
Have a feeling Carmine is not there.

[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.980]
He goes to the track every Thursday.

[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.100]
So he says.

[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.060]
Yeah, he does.

[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.100]
And if that's the case, then they may not be listening over there.

[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.260]
Or they may just have played hooky in state home and said,

[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.320]
hey, the hell would you Carmine,

[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.680]
we're taking the day off to or something?

[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.020]
I doubt that very much.

[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.800]
So anyway, the fact that we wanted those two antipostos

[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.100]
salads and the steak and cheese sub or whatever it is you eat every day.

[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.740]
I guess that's just gonna fall on deaf ears.

[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.100]
And excuse us.

[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.080]
And since it is Thursday and Linda will be coming from Newtish system later,

[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.340]
at least we want to have to account for how many extra olives we had for lunch today.

[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:48.740]
Okay.

[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.800]
So in other words, what I'm trying to say is we have a desperate situation.

[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.380]
And I don't for the life of me know why on Thursday, for example,

[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.120]
we couldn't have had some good stuff from Davie come down.

[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:02.640]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.460]
Yeah, from a certain cafe, one of our fine sponsors with that incredible food like they brought.

[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.720]
But again, you know, see they're not looking out for us.

[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.900]
These salespeople, we feed the whole building.

[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.120]
But they're just not looking out for us the way they should be.

[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.140]
Although Tom is certainly looking out for us, boy.

[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.120]
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.240]
Now, every time I see him now, I get so depressed.

[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:34.620]
Now, Roger, the dean used to talk about all the salespeople and all the people in the office, didn't he?

[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.060]
Yeah. Oh, sure he did, yeah.

[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.960]
He used to talk about salespeople who died 20 years ago.

[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.780]
I'm not making that up every time I see him.

[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.260]
He's got some sad story.

[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.940]
And I mean, here we've got this mountain of mail.

[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:56.000]
It's amazing to me, for example, other people in the sales department tell me about many of the accounts,

[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:56.860]
how delirious they are.

[00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.220]
They're getting tremendous response and it just delirious and all this.

[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:09.560]
And, um, but Tom is just, I don't know, got that head kind of hung down to a floor, which in his case doesn't take a lot.

[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.420]
About two feet.

[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.440]
Don't mention my name on a year.

[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.020]
Whatever you do.

[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.120]
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, don't mention it.

[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.080]
29 past 11 at WIOD. Let's go to Miramar. Hello.

[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:22.800]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:23.740]
Just great.

[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.440]
You know, you mentioned Debbie Ellis in the last hour.

[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.200]
A monster in the business, sir.

[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.480]
That is for sure.

[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.480]
You know, she made an appearance in the land of the walking dead last week.

[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.740]
Where we saw also known as Hollandale.

[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.160]
Well, for that station, that's a great place.

[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.360]
Debbie does Hollandale, huh?

[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:44.200]
Yeah. I guess he was scouting up some listeners visiting some of her listeners.

[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.640]
That's a great place to find them.

[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.400]
No question about it, boy.

[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.640]
In fact, she was probably visiting some of the children of her listeners, some in their 80s and 90s.

[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.100]
Have you ever seen that movie Dawn of the Dead?

[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:55.260]
No.

[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.660]
Where with the zombies and the shopping mall?

[00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:58.280]
Oh, sure.

[00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:59.160]
Have you ever been to the town?

[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.120]
Listen, I don't have to go to the movies to see zombies in this town, my friend.

[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.860]
Have you ever been to the Diplomat Mall?

[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.220]
Yeah.

[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:09.960]
You know, we once did a remote from there in which we made Mr. Intendola look like a jackass, which wasn't hard.

[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:10.620]
He just showed up.

[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.580]
You would notice a great similarity between the Diplomat Mall and that movie.

[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.200]
Yeah.

[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:20.580]
See, the problem is I usually park on the other side of the street if I want to go to the Diplomat Mall, and I can never get there.

[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.860]
Yeah, I guess all the old people are like that.

[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.180]
I was wondering, did you ever get Elvis' everywhere?

[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.120]
Did you ever bring that back?

[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.880]
No, I've got it at home on it.

[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.680]
I was going to put it on that master and I forgot.

[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.100]
And I certainly wasn't going to go all the way home to get the CD and not only that.

[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.600]
I'll bring it in one day next week.

[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.320]
I promise it.

[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.100]
I'll play it on a year.

[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:43.900]
And then anybody who doesn't have it who's too cheap to go out and buy the CD or the record, they can tape it.

[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.020]
Well, maybe you can play the I-95 song later then.

[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.000]
Well, maybe I can.

[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.840]
No, maybe you can, and off.

[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:50.980]
Or not as a case, maybe.

[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.420]
I'd like to say that Owl, who works at the Lake Forest Direct, is a big douchebag.

[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.120]
Okay.

[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:56.400]

[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.780]
Have a great holiday, sir.

[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.120]
You do.

[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.680]
1131 at W-Y-O-D, the Czechs.

[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.860]
We got a mountain of mail here again today.

[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.400]
Rich is just wondering why he ever got himself into this.

[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.540]
And I said in the beginning, are you sure you want to do this?

[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.400]
And he said, absolutely.

[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:15.500]
And I can't think of anything I'd rather spend my time doing than helping out these wonderful folks get their cassette tapes.

[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:18.920]
It's more of a very good cause.

[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.420]
And of course, the boons in the box are for a good cause too.

[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.980]
Anybody who doesn't have their own boon in the box this holiday season is really missing out.

[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.680]
So what do we decide about the food?

[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.620]
We don't want to make a big production out of this because we're not eating that much anyway.

[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.040]
Some of us, but you know, we're certainly not going to starve to death.

[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:35.720]
Are we?

[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.320]
Definitely not.

[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.160]
Okay.

[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.740]
But you don't think that they're coming from the Armadillo Cafe.

[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.880]
Probably a little short notice.

[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.380]
Just a little boy.

[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.460]
I'm thinking back to that hot crab ravioli.

[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.680]
And that incredible tenderloin with the onions.

[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.180]
How many peas did you have?

[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.000]
How many olives?

[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.120]
Three olives?

[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:01.660]
Four olives?

[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:02.080]
Come on.

[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.520]
Too many onions.

[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.000]
Anyway, it's 11.32 at WIOD.

[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.900]
Want to tell you about the Nutri system right now?

[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.880]
Oh, which is very timely.

[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.260]
Well, we'd lend it gets a little bit hysterical, but we're doing just fine.

[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:14.620]

[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:15.140]
D.

[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.500]
Well, I'm going to tell you something.

[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.740]
I'm going to get a hold of Denimberg and I'm going to tear every hair in his head out.

[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:21.720]
Okay.

[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.040]
They have taken the other piece.

[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.980]
Now, let me tell you what that was about.

[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.100]
A little conversation because I don't like to or let the audience in on the inside.

[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.180]
Then we'll get to Donna's incredible cart.

[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:37.180]
There were two pieces of copy in here for a lot of tavern at it, which is one of my favorite restaurants in the world.

[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.580]
It's an incredible Italian restaurant.

[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.060]
It's so good that I can't begin to tell you.

[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.000]
And there are two pieces of copy.

[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.440]
One of them had the phone number.

[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:49.660]
And somebody, I'm not sure who it was, took the other piece of copy out.

[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.020]
He's constantly coming into this book.

[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.440]
I'm going to break his arm.

[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.800]
Is Denimberg in a building?

[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.960]
It's one of those pictures we were supposed to see.

[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:05.020]
Now, because that's coming up in the next break and I want to give their phone because they're having a special thing on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.

[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.520]
And I don't have the number in here because they took the other piece of copy.

[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.120]
Oh, I see.

[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:10.700]
Look what they did.

[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.160]
They stuck it on the back.

[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.260]
Now, who do you think did that?

[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.920]
Some smart ass is coming in here messing with my book.

[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.020]
Anyway, it's 1137.

[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.000]
I don't want to get hysterical again like yesterday, but God Almighty.

[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.880]
Some people take things that are so simple and they make them so complicated.

[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.740]
But I don't talk about me any year.

[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:34.280]
Anyway, here is a card in the midst of all this mountain of mail, all this, these checks and great stuff coming in.

[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.620]
I don't see a check in it, by the way.

[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.660]
But it says, Dearest Douchebag.

[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.900]
That's printed on the card with a picture.

[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.860]
It must be done on the front of you holding the animal bag.

[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:44.360]
Yeah, it is.

[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:45.380]
Sure.

[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.780]
Talk about being left holding the bag.

[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.440]
Dearest Douchebag, why is it that you can call me an asshole?

[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.560]
Play the I-95 asshole song.

[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.660]
Steve just used the word A-H.

[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:59.740]
But I responded to your statement about staying and I call him an asshole and you cunningly bleep it.

[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:00.640]
I didn't bleep it out.

[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.920]
Did you bleep it?

[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:03.820]
He did.

[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.280]
Don't be bleeping stuff.

[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.620]
He did bleep.

[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.060]
See, he's getting a little carried away in there.

[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.140]
I'll take care of the bleeping.

[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.760]
Okay, I'll take care of all the bleeping.

[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.260]
If I want it on a year, I'll be responsible for it.

[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.100]
But if we're saying the word on a year or playing records with it, then don't go bleeping stuff.

[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.860]
See, he's got too much power in there.

[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:25.280]
We need to render him a little less power crazy in the other studio there.

[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.880]
And you cunningly bleep it, which I didn't do, nick did that and he will never do it again under penalty of death.

[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.680]
Leaving the audience to believe I used a major vulgarity, underlined major, very cute.

[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.680]
Here's the impression you meant to leave.

[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.840]
Smart radio, bleeper, and then hang up.

[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:41.560]
Pressure too great.

[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:46.140]
You can't go one-on-one with anyone except the veggies, almonds, and stems of the world.

[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:50.160]
Not only do you insist upon reading my letters on the year to get a show,

[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:55.060]
you now have to read the only letter I've ever written to Steve and the last underlined.

[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.420]
I'm going to stop supplying you with shows in my material which you've borrowed for years.

[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.800]
Good day and goodbye forever.

[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.920]
Throw this in the trash because I won't hear you anyway.

[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.720]
Rose must be saying, thank God, Disney WIOD got him.

[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.540]
Nothing at that station suits you either.

[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:12.720]
Donna.

[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.360]
Now what are we going to do without her material now?

[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.300]
I don't know, we probably have to fold up shop here.

[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.600]
Good Lord, this is crisis.

[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.260]
Better tell Denimberg about it, he'll be running up and down.

[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.460]
No more Donna material.

[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.460]
Oh no.

[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.260]
Man, I'm telling you.

[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.860]
Boy, what a severe day.

[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.740]
Without Donna, I just have no idea.

[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:33.920]
What is she doing anyway?

[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.200]
What are you doing?

[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.840]
Oh, you're helping out.

[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.480]
We much rather have lunch.

[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.140]
Anyway, it's 11-40-20-till noon.

[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.060]
It's serious.

[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.840]
At WIOD, we're not joking about that.

[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:48.740]
No, that's it.

[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.180]
See what you can do.

[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.660]
The floor is closed today?

[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.960]
I'm not buying that for a second.

[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.200]
It's possible.

[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.760]
They might be closed until after Christmas.

[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:58.220]
You know those folks over there.

[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.240]
They've got a great sense of humor.

[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.200]
And if that's the case, then we'll probably have to ask for the Armadillo Cafe to come all

[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.340]
away from debut, which they're definitely not going to do.

[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:06.880]
But, uh,

[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.400]
pizza law would be sensational, but Jeff ain't going to come all the way over here again.

[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.740]
Something a little more substantial than that salad salad was great.

[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.020]
He brought about 40 pounds of it.

[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.720]
It was tremendous, but something a little more of substance.

[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.400]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:22.360]
Substance.

[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:22.920]
Yeah.

[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.380]
And then Linda will come very quickly and say,

[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.720]
bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.

[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:28.660]
It's getting old.

[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:29.700]
It's getting ponderous.

[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.600]
All these people go, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.

[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.420]
Just everybody minds your own business and leave us alone.

[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.740]
Just leave us alone.

[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.000]
We'll do everything in our own sweet good time.

[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:38.320]
All right?

[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.000]
So here's a good stack of checks for you, Sharon.

[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.280]
Just to have a good time with that.

[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:44.680]
And let's take a call from Miami.

[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.080]
Hello.

[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:45.700]
Hi.

[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.140]
Yeah.

[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:46.860]
Yeah.

[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:52.780]
I was wondering if you can go ahead and use kind of a different name on when you say douchebags to all of them.

[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:53.940]
Because you kind of use it often.

[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:58.040]
What about like a siph-lettic leopard douchebag or something like,

[00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.900]
I mean, really get that intense meaning.

[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:01.120]
Okay.

[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:01.940]
Let's move right along.

[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.220]
Let's go to, here's a guy who wants to a direct-to-show.

[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:04.380]
Yeah.

[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.720]
We've got all these directors now.

[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.460]
I believe it's alone.

[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.360]
That's what you just said.

[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:07.980]
Kindle.

[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:08.200]
Hello.

[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:09.200]
Kindle.

[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:09.580]
Yeah.

[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:10.340]
I don't want to.

[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.220]
It's real quick.

[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:12.880]
The photographer.

[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:14.660]
I know.

[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.440]
Oh, this is a shock.

[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.320]
This is a truly shocking experience.

[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:19.960]
No joke.

[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.940]
How's the butt-looking duck?

[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.860]
Rick, are you looking for trouble already?

[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.620]
I get a feeling everybody in this place is looking for trouble.

[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:29.980]
Just.

[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.120]
I think 75 found trouble.

[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.420]
Have you seen me?

[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.660]
Don't pick on Sunny, okay?

[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.500]
He's a good guy and he just gave him a royal screwing which is par for the course in his business.

[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:39.480]
Oh, man.

[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.280]
You ought to know that.

[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:41.380]
Poor guy.

[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.760]
So what are you doing these days?

[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:42.860]

[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:42.860]

[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:42.860]

[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:42.860]

[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:42.860]

[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:42.860]

[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.680]
Oh, I just started a new job and I'm waiting to get paid.

[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.640]
I've been working for like 1500 days and they haven't paid me yet.

[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.520]
One of these big behinds that are always losing money.

[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.100]
Really?

[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.520]
Can't imagine which one I've got.

[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:54.740]
I wonder, huh?

[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:55.160]
Yeah.

[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.700]
So anyway, when you getting married, Rick?

[00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.120]
Next year.

[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:00.580]
89?

[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:01.380]
Yeah.

[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.920]
The magic number.

[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:03.660]
Well, I'll be damned.

[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.040]
Yeah, me too.

[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.760]
We ought to have the wedding on the ear.

[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.460]
That would be exciting.

[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.540]
Are you crazy?

[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:10.300]
No.

[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.480]
Well, yeah, but I mean, that has nothing to do with it.

[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.340]
It's a great idea.

[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.180]
You know, what else is new?

[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.520]
Weeping in the background would be just emotional.

[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.440]
I know.

[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.560]
I would be weeping, too.

[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.180]
Yeah.

[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.200]
I'm sure.

[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:23.120]
Well, not much.

[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:27.980]
We're just hanging out here having a great time waiting for Sharon to go call us or order in for lunch.

[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.320]
You want to die now?

[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.060]
Yeah.

[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:31.620]
That's great, man.

[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.180]
You have lost almost 20 pounds, Rick.

[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:33.780]
That's great.

[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.220]
It's a shadow of my former self.

[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.740]
I'm fading away and Fat Rich looks almost like slim pickens over here.

[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:40.140]
Almost.

[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:41.240]
What is your goal?

[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:42.800]
What is my goal?

[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.500]
You're asking the wrong person that question, Rick.

[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:47.920]
72 pounds.

[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:48.880]
Well, that's not.

[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.140]
It's only got about 50 to go.

[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:50.980]
That's all right.

[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.260]
How long is it going to take you?

[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.220]
It's going to till whenever I'm done.

[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:55.320]
Okay, I'm not in any hurry.

[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.620]
I've carried this stuff around for a long time and I'm not in any big hurry.

[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.240]
When I lose it, I lose it.

[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:01.720]
Are you listening, Linda?

[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.720]
When I lose it all, I lose it.

[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.820]
So if I have a couple extra olives, don't get hysterical, all right?

[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.600]
So now you're back on AM.

[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.140]
Yeah.

[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:11.940]
And everything.

[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.120]
Good deduction, Rick.

[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.080]
Good deduction, excellent.

[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.240]
It seems like you've speeded up a little bit since we talked last time.

[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.420]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.780]
See, I thought he was hysterical because I shined him twice for the track and I figured,

[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.000]
well, we won't hear from Rick anymore.

[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.140]
Well, you know, I listened to it with kind of P.O. that day and all I hear.

[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.100]
Well, it just, I listened.

[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:30.880]
That was a bad day.

[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.480]
When you're in this business, you have a lot of bad days.

[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.160]
Can I give you an example?

[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.840]
I was, this is not contrived or made up.

[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.540]
This is a true story.

[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:41.920]
I was coming in yesterday and I was driving over the causeway in my beautiful Corvette.

[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:46.160]
And I was looking at the water and I was thinking to myself, everything is great.

[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.380]
Everything is wonderful.

[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.800]
You know, it's been great being over here and I'm making all this money and the life is marvelous.

[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.920]
And everything and I live in that fantastic house and everything is sensational, right?

[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:57.340]
Yeah.

[00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.700]
And by 1230, I was ready to blow my brains out here, okay?

[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:01.300]
Why?

[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.420]
Well, you didn't hear the show yesterday, huh?

[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.020]
I heard a little bit of it.

[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.200]
Yeah, we don't want to rehash, you know.

[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.460]
Oh, yeah, yeah, about that.

[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.020]
Yeah, about our friend at the...

[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:14.580]
Well, you hear they want to, now they want to extend the band on obscenities for 24 hours.

[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.620]
Yeah, they don't want us to say hello, goodbye or anything else like that.

[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:18.880]
They just want you to come on and...

[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.940]
We can just make little whimpering guttural sounds and that's going to be it.

[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.340]
Yeah, kind of like that.

[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:26.140]
Yeah.

[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.860]
Yeah, I'll make little whimpering sounds and the duck can cackle and that'll basically...

[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.220]
They'll probably get a 40 share, you know?

[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.860]
Yeah, and then the bird will be able to get his own show, right?

[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.300]
Yeah, which would make a lot of people happy, obviously.

[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.340]
People would have nothing better to do than call it and bitch and mull it up and play.

[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:39.560]
Yeah.

[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.940]
Have you ever anything like Merry Christmas?

[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:41.820]
Isn't it amazing?

[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.620]
You know the ones that call and say, hey, you stink Merry Christmas.

[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.060]
Yeah, speaking of stink, how is a major?

[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.260]
It's not that way, terrible.

[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.800]
See, now you're feeding Donna again.

[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.560]
Even though she...

[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.840]
We know she's not listening.

[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:55.920]
You're feeding her again.

[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.280]
You know I missed that guy.

[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.220]
I can't believe that he dumped...

[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.620]
Yeah, no, it's shocking her call.

[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:02.560]
I know, unnecessary.

[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.320]
I get real serally when a boardop start dumping this stuff, you know?

[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:05.840]
Oh, there he comes.

[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.600]
Anyway, I get hysterical when that stuff's done.

[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.180]
Who's that?

[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:11.780]

[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:12.840]
Yeah, he's still in town.

[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:13.220]
Yeah.

[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:14.660]
Yeah, they had the baby.

[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:15.920]
Oh, yeah.

[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.640]
Looks a little bit like him, so I'm praying that it changes real fast.

[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.360]
My God, he's going to be in trouble.

[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.860]
In fact, it was born with a Stogi in one part of it's an enemy.

[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.900]
I can't tell you where, but the horrendous Stogi, yeah.

[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:33.380]
And the first thing when they tried to change the diapers, it said...

[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.020]
Outchanges.

[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.960]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.120]
True, true, yeah.

[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.060]
Well, it's great hearing from you.

[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.720]
And one of these days when you least expect it, something will happen.

[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:44.280]
Yeah.

[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.820]
All right, well, I'll still...

[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.280]
So how's your sister doing?

[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.000]
She's all right, she's getting married too.

[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:49.980]
Is she, really?

[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:50.360]
Yeah.

[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.240]
Oh, the duck just had a little accident on her too.

[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.720]
Well, listen, call us again, not to be a stranger now, okay?

[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.160]
All right.

[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.840]
And I hope you get paid one of these years, okay?

[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.460]
Yeah, I'm hoping to get paid so I can do my Christmas shopping.

[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.700]
Yeah, well, maybe next year.

[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.240]
Yeah.

[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:03.980]
Okay, Rick.

[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:04.500]
All right.

[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:05.200]
Take care.

[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:05.500]
Bye.

[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.420]
Well, that was a shock, wasn't it?

[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.080]
Ricta photographer.

[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.140]
So you left him out of the letter too, Donna.

[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.200]
We like talking to him.

[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.460]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.080]
You idiot.

[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.460]
You disgusting, psychotic douchebag.

[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:17.520]
She is something else.

[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.320]
And she, we go through this with her constantly.

[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.620]
You know, this love and hate.

[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.320]
And then she's back.

[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.320]
Another couple of weeks she'll be back on her again.

[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:23.420]
Oh, right now.

[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.720]
And she just can't restrain herself.

[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:25.900]
She's just a pain in the butt.

[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:26.440]
I know.

[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.280]
What's Laura got here now, boy?

[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.700]
She's got something real exciting.

[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.720]
What is it?

[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.040]
Ha, ha, ha, is it from Tom?

[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:33.680]
Oh, no, I got it.

[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.300]
OPS, Tom Denver, he's afraid to come in.

[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:37.740]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.920]
We can hear some of this dirty laundry right on the air.

[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:40.560]
That'll be good.

[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.660]
Send him in here.

[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.120]
And the audience get a little sample of his psychosis.

[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.340]
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.660]
Come, but stay away from me.

[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.980]
Okay, Laura, come, but stay away.

[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.540]
I worked with him at Winds, boy.

[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.640]
That was exciting enough.

[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:53.900]
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.100]
He doesn't be nice to me.

[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.500]
I'll tell a story about the one book that I had that

[00:33:58.500 --> 00:33:59.420]
3-8 at night.

[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.480]
The only time that anybody ever beat me at night because

[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.640]
somebody you wanted to put all those playoff games on

[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.060]
or we had zero, or we had zero shares.

[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:10.660]
Trust me, Latavrinette is going to do great.

[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.060]
They've been with me for a long time.

[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.240]
There's no problem, Tom.

[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:13.840]
Trust me.

[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:14.720]
Trust me.

[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:15.980]
Put away your IOD, Hanky.

[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.020]
Okay, go cry in it.

[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.960]
Will you please shed some tears?

[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:19.680]
Just relax.

[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.100]
You're too nervous.

[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.360]
You're a wonderful guy, but you're just too

[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:23.760]
excited.

[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.040]
Get off my back.

[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.240]
Be like me.

[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.240]
Be more relaxed.

[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.040]
Calm down.

[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.120]
Don't get hysterical.

[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.440]
Just try to be more like me.

[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:30.800]
Okay?

[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:33.260]
Okay, let me do the spot now.

[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.740]
If I leave anything out, Tom, no, seriously, Tom can

[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.980]
embellish it a little bit and tell you they're giving you dinner

[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:40.260]
free and stuff like that to make sure they get a gigantic.

[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:40.820]
Well, they're not.

[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.760]
They're not, but you'll be more than happy to pay for it.

[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:44.800]
That's what they say in sunrise.

[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:46.700]
Be sure to reserve it.

[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:47.280]
It's 1151.

[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.500]
We have an incredible call.

[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.180]
Joe at Flores is on line.

[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:50.540]
Joe.

[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:51.920]
What's going on?

[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.480]
I don't know.

[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.160]
Great.

[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.660]
Listen, we'll need some lunch.

[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:55.520]
Please.

[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.260]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.800]
We've been getting these reports probably inaccurate.

[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.220]
Did you guys aren't even open today?

[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.680]
No, I'm just a late commentator.

[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.100]
Oh, you guys were late today?

[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:03.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.340]
Well, we won't tell a car line about it, okay?

[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:06.020]
That's okay.

[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:06.980]
You're coming with my partner.

[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.560]
I'm the old partner.

[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:09.360]
I take it in late.

[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.020]
So to speak, yeah.

[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:13.480]
You got it.

[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.160]
Yeah, just a couple of those antipostos with all the good stuff

[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.780]
that you guys put on and one of those cheese and steak subs

[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:19.400]
will be great.

[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.020]
Very good.

[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.200]
And please don't tell people I'm close.

[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:21.800]
That's terrible.

[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.700]
No, no, well, I'm sure you couldn't have been.

[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:24.880]
I mean, you guys aren't that crazy.

[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.880]
No, only Christmas day.

[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.860]
That's the Christmas day.

[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:26.900]

[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:27.860]
I've seen about 15 minutes.

[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:28.440]
Thanks a million.

[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.240]
Bye-bye.

[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:29.900]
Bye.

[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.040]
I do like that.

[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:31.960]
They're even bringing it here.

[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.060]
You see?

[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.020]
You guys have little faith.

[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:40.300]
And of course, Sharon, you give a little child a big-sized job.

[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.240]
And they just crumble.

[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.360]
It's just a joke, Sharon.

[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.400]
Don't get emotional, man.

[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.620]
Everybody the last couple of days here is so emotional.

[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:47.480]
It must be the holidays.

[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.340]
I mean, so glad when these holidays are over.

[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:49.740]
I know.

[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.120]
Everybody is so sensitive and uptight and hysterical.

[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.480]
And Donna.

[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.540]
And then he dumps stuff.

[00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.600]
I can't believe that.

[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.260]
That is just mind-boggling.

[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.660]
Now, you can dump Donna.

[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:03.940]
I thought exactly.

[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.300]
It was like anybody else.

[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:05.620]
That's an obscurity.

[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:06.740]
Yeah, that's an obscurity.

[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.280]
But Donna, that's like an industry eat it.

[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.340]
You know, that would be like dumping Bob from Pompo-no.

[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.240]
Or blind Mike.

[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:14.840]
That's good.

[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.700]
And that's it.

[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.700]
Or Jamie and Marcy.

[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.340]
Or Bob Martin.

[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.840]
How about Phil?

[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:25.920]
Yeah.

[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.740]
Or Paul Harvey Jr. Jr.

[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:29.680]
A.K.A.

[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.200]
Speaking of Paul Harvey Jr. Jr.

[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.200]
It's a little something I thought.

[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.180]
Thought it might be appropriate.

[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.620]
Very Christmas, Paul.

[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.320]
Happy Jiu-Los.

[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.540]
Don't ever call us again.

[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:54.820]
Well, I was driving down 995 the other night.

[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.200]
Somebody nearly cut me right off the road.

[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.300]
I decided wasn't going to do any good to get mad.

[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.800]
I wrote a song about him instead.

[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:06.860]
It goes like this.

[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:11.580]
Where you are in asshole.

[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.520]
Or did you work in your whole life?

[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.600]
Either way, it worked out fine.

[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.220]
Cause you're an asshole tonight.

[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.800]
Yes, you're an A.S.S.S.S.A.

[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:29.560]
So, Ellie.

[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:33.580]
And don't you try to blame it on me.

[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.920]
You deserve all the credit.

[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.320]
You're an asshole tonight.

[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.840]
You were an asshole yesterday.

[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.500]
You're an asshole tonight.

[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:59.860]
I've got a feeling you'll be an asshole the rest of your life.

[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:44.040]
And I was talking to your mother just the other night.

[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.320]
I told her I thought you were an asshole.

[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.020]
She said yes, I think you're right.

[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:58.380]
And all your friends are asshole.

[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.080]
Cause you know that you're a whole life.

[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:10.260]
And somebody told me you've got an asshole for life.

[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:16.580]
Were you born an asshole?

[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.320]
Or did you work in your whole life?

[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.540]
Either way, it worked out fine.

[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:30.780]
Cause you're an A.S.S.S.S.

[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.840]
This is the Neal Roger show.

[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.620]
That is your brain.

[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:39.540]
Any questions?

[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.320]
Holds a knife.

[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.040]
1156 at WIOD.

[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.180]
And you know what they say if the shoe fits.

[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.280]
Court Lauderdale.

[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:50.580]
Hello.

[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.080]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.500]
Yeah, happy holiday to you all.

[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:56.680]
And the same to you, y'all.

[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.920]
I'm a long time listener when you were first on WKAT.

[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:00.760]
Oh, boy.

[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:05.520]
I'm getting ready to send in the check for the Camille South with a tape.

[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:05.980]
Great.

[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.560]
One favor I need from you.

[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:12.600]
I think I spoke to Berlai Shia at the other station when he did your show about the Koshiklub.

[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]
I had written to the people who made the album and told him I need it, cassette.

[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.120]
And they don't manufacture a cassette.

[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:22.060]
And I don't have a record player, only a cassette player.

[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:27.500]
So I'm thinking if I said an additional tape, maybe you can hit a lot for me.

[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.240]
For the Koshiklub, remember Berlai?

[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.000]
I had an issue about that.

[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.340]
How much are you sending, pal?

[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:32.420]
Well, whatever it takes.

[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:32.720]
You know.

[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:33.100]
Oh.

[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:35.700]
That's an old extra.

[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:36.920]
I mean, whatever you think is right.

[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:37.860]
I mean, you know, you tell me.

[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.460]
Yeah, it's not like an extra 20, you know.

[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.140]
Okay, an extra tape, right?

[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:41.960]
Yeah, an extra tape.

[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:44.980]
But make sure you put a notation what it is, because I'm going to have to do that at home.

[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.440]
I've got the album, and I'll dub the album.

[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:47.380]
Okay, sounds good.

[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.000]
I wouldn't do that for just anybody, you know.

[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.340]
Okay, well, I appreciate it.

[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:51.900]
I'm a long time listener, and I love your show.

[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:52.320]
Great.

[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.140]
Have a nice holiday.

[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:53.620]
You too.

[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:54.060]
Have a nice holiday.

[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:54.660]
You survived.

[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:55.240]
There he goes.

[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.160]
What was that all about?

[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.620]
I was about to say if he survived KAT.

[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.680]
I guess I should be saying if I survived KAT, I'll do it.

[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:03.080]
What was that?

[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.500]
Hock and a Chinatown in the background.

[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.840]
Shrying and carrying on.

[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:07.200]
I don't know.

[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.600]
Okay, we have an open-line in Broward now.

[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.460]
If you move very fast, no, we don't.

[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.760]
Now, if I want to dub with that Johnny Mathis song, if you start it.

[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.180]
If you start, we have a special lunch for you.

[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:22.840]
Do you remember the picture that came in yesterday?

[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.820]
The one from on the lawn?

[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.100]
Same old stuff.

[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:28.960]
Davey, hello.

[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:29.900]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:30.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.260]
This is the first time I've called since you left Zeta.

[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:34.880]
Boy, where the hell have you been?

[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.180]
I've been at school.

[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.720]
We just got off last week, so I haven't had much of a chance to call.

[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:40.480]
You know what school?

[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.160]
Broward Community College.

[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:42.840]
Oh, yeah.

[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.120]
Remember me?

[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:45.360]
I was going out with Michelle.

[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:48.700]
With Michelle.

[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:49.500]
Right.

[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.200]
Which Michelle?

[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:50.700]

[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:51.820]
Which one?

[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:52.980]
Teen and Michelle.

[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.020]
I was, we were engaged.

[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:55.980]
Oh, yeah.

[00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.360]
Well, we're still engaged.

[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:57.800]
Great.

[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:58.440]
Well, that's good.

[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.160]
You know these long relationships have been about two weeks?

[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.680]
No, it's been about, we've been going out about a year and a month.

[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:05.140]
Great.

[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.400]
Anyway, I was just thinking about it.

[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.280]
I missed some of your old tingles from Zeta.

[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.620]
I was wondering if you could take out this Zeta 4,

[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.020]
or kind of search for and remove it.

[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.240]
And you could, like, you know, he's the first kid on the block,

[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.200]
and he's the bright one.

[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:18.860]
That's a good idea.

[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.500]
We'll call John Ford over there and see if he'll work that up for us.

[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:21.720]
Sure.

[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.420]
Come on, Johnny.

[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.140]
You got none of those spots to dub over there.

[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:24.980]
Let's get with it.

[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.640]
Because this is really good spots.

[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:27.220]
Yeah, they were.

[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.600]
So probably the best stuff Rose ever came up with in his life.

[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:31.340]
That's right.

[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.580]
Okay, we'll work on it.

[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.280]
Okay, I think you're doing a great job over here.

[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.980]
And also, I think the birds doing a great job.

[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:37.580]
Thank you.

[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.900]
Okay, have a great holiday.

[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.460]
And let me commend you on your excellent taste.

[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:41.380]
What can I say?

[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.180]
Bye-bye.

[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.440]
I'll bet Mike like that, close.

[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:47.260]
I want to thank Eric, who's under 100, he's 22 and bulker for the Christmas card.

[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:49.840]
I mean, we've got a lot of Christmas cards, but also there are some of these people

[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.780]
like Jose Morales, who I know is a big fan.

[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:52.320]
Remember Jose?

[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.180]
An executive center's network?

[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:54.760]
Yes.

[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:55.020]

[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:58.600]
And we want to thank Jose for the card and everybody else and for all the checks and just keep them

[00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.020]
on coming.

[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:03.320]
So if they get them in a mail before 5 today, some of the stuff might actually show up tomorrow.

[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:03.740]
Maybe.

[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.360]
Okay, and we really are hoping to get to that 25 grand mark.

[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.580]
Okay, news upcoming with April I believe.

[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.380]
April is here for a fan club with a new news and we'll come back at 1205.

[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:18.920]
524 WIOD in Broward or 655-278 WIOD in the Palm Beach.

[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:20.640]
Other areas make our collect.

[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:25.720]
The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station.

[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:30.760]
Now, here's Neil Rogers, our new stock radio 610-WIOD.

[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.680]
105 and I just want to, you know, the policeman we had on air or whatever he does in law enforcement,

[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:41.340]
so irrational, you couldn't possibly have an intelligent conversation because he was screaming and puking and shouting

[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.900]
and didn't want to listen to anything I had to say.

[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.960]
But the whole criminal justice system in this country is a farce.

[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:54.600]
It's a travesty and to try to defend any of the parts that's wrong with it by saying, well, just a handful.

[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:55.820]
That's a lot of garbage.

[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:01.620]
God help anybody that gets in the web of criminal justice system in this country.

[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:02.400]
I'll tell you that.

[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.160]
A hank.

[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.860]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, just a shadow of himself, man.

[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.220]
You lost a lot of weight again.

[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:09.980]
Thanks only promise.

[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.160]
Thanks only promise he keeps finding it.

[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:12.620]
That's interesting.

[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.900]
Neil, you're talking issues here.

[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.080]
No, I'm the one.

[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.400]
Don't get nailed by those pigs out there, man.

[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.220]
I'm telling you.

[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.540]
I heard nobody talks issues, but are you do?

[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:23.680]
Get out of here.

[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:25.840]
Well, you were not doing that crap again, all right?

[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.660]
No, I don't need to hit this joke.

[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:28.920]
Leave it to Steve, OK?

[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.380]
I can't turn out a radio when I hear it.

[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.720]
I mean, you would think that some of these cops are the criminals.

[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:36.240]
According to Steve, I'm not forget, that's right.

[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.220]
You and Steve are very tight and I want to get in there.

[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.240]
Oh, so I'm getting lost.

[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.220]
No, not still.

[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:42.200]
I thought you guys were.

[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:42.900]
I don't hear a shit.

[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.020]
He said you're a douchebag.

[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.680]
Now, he didn't say that.

[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.900]
He said, hang sorry.

[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:48.280]
How are you?

[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:49.280]
You don't have to worry.

[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.280]
What time you get off?

[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:52.620]
What time do you get off?

[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.600]
What does he get nervous about?

[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:54.400]
Are you going to the track?

[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:54.820]
Yeah.

[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.140]
It's Thursday.

[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.060]
Oh, you're going out with cars?

[00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:58.880]
What does that mean?

[00:44:59.160 --> 00:44:59.960]
Oh, my God.

[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.660]
What happens on Thursday?

[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:02.620]
I don't know if I know of that.

[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:03.820]
I don't know if I get a chance to go on Thursday,

[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.060]
but because of Christmas, nobody misses you.

[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:07.060]
Oh, is that it?

[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:07.340]
Yeah.

[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:08.440]
I'm out there hiding.

[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.180]
Probably all the upper-level management people are out there too.

[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.460]
Well, nobody misses them most of the time anyway,

[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:14.740]
but that's another level of management.

[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:14.780]

[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:15.200]
Yeah.

[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.280]
A middle-level management is.

[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:17.500]
Yeah.

[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:18.700]
It's a gallbladder.

[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:21.380]
It's a gallbladder because while it's there,

[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.660]
it causes the occasional pain as nuisance value.

[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.940]
And when you remove it, you don't remember it was there before.

[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:28.380]
Excuse me.

[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:29.220]
Don't get excited now.

[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.380]
I said, I can't get excited now.

[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.220]
You start talking issues again here now.

[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.780]
So you didn't get to go to Hawaii, huh?

[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:35.860]
No, that's...

[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:36.700]
I know that's the university.

[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:37.640]
I know that's his thing.

[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:37.980]
Yeah.

[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.520]
The Jordan get to go either.

[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:39.720]
He's there either.

[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.140]
Had I been invited, I certainly...

[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:42.240]
Probably would have gone now.

[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.260]
That was a great spurt.

[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:44.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.460]
You guys had a good time up there.

[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:47.440]
Rick sounded like he was on his last legs.

[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.420]
Those two mornings, man.

[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.560]
After he came back, he sounded in bad shape.

[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:51.540]
Very cold there.

[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:51.940]
Really?

[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.280]
Could have fooled a hell out of me.

[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.760]
But the game made more than made up for it.

[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:56.940]
Yeah, it fits first.

[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:57.400]
Yeah.

[00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.000]
I could just...

[00:45:59.000 --> 00:45:59.140]
I could just...

[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:01.620]
See his first reaction if you had...

[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.180]
I said, man, go right ahead.

[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.200]
You don't have to be on invitation here.

[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:05.820]
What do you want, Hank?

[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:07.880]
Oh, look at that.

[00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:08.640]
That rich came in.

[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:09.280]
It just...

[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.260]
Oh, you're a fat rich, huh?

[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.160]
You're a fat guy.

[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:27.160]

[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:27.160]

[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:27.160]

[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:27.160]

[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:27.160]

[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:27.160]

[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:27.160]

[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:27.160]

[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:27.180]
You're a fat guy.

[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:27.180]

[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:27.180]

[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:27.180]

[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:27.180]

[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:27.180]

[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:27.320]
You're a fat guy.

[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:27.320]

[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:27.320]

[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:27.320]

[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:27.360]
You're a fat guy.

[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:27.900]
You're a fat guy.

[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:28.160]
You're a fat guy.

[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:28.520]
You're a fat guy.

[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.580]
You're a fat guy.

[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.260]
You're a fat guy.

[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:36.340]
You're a fat guy.

[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.240]
You're a fat guy.

[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:40.840]
He's got...

[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:41.740]
You can rip him.

[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.100]
He's got kids on it.

[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.300]
He's got a pre-holiday show.

[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:48.000]
He's got an atheist and a hysterical fundamentalist reverendon.

[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.000]
How contrived.

[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:50.340]
Yeah, well, this contrived.

[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.220]
Right before Christmas and the Sookas, yeah.

[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.100]
But anyway, this New York thing, you know, about...

[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:56.760]
No, seriously, you're not a sports fan.

[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:57.400]
Who?

[00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:58.160]
You.

[00:46:58.460 --> 00:46:58.600]
Me?

[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.860]
None of you people, you know, these New York types,

[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.280]
that only if they got a bet on the game,

[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.380]
do they have any interest in it?

[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.240]
If they don't have any money on the game, they don't care.

[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.080]
How could you watch football game on that?

[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:10.200]
Oh, see, now we got into it.

[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:10.420]
It's true.

[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:12.180]
I have never bet on a football game.

[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:12.640]
You haven't?

[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:12.800]
No.

[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:16.500]
And what really bugs me and your good friend, Larry King,

[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.860]
who we're so delighted to have as part of the WIOD family,

[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:21.300]
by the way, is a check that Larry wrote for you to catch before he leaves.

[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:23.400]
Oh, what a follow-up.

[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:23.400]

[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.460]
But follow the bouncing ball.

[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.420]
Even the heat never dribbled that well.

[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.080]
But, you know, the same thing.

[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.980]
Everything is the spread.

[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:34.960]
And did they cover it?

[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:36.500]
I've been talking about this for years.

[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:37.260]
Okay.

[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:41.720]
And like, the networks now are so blatant about it with Jimmy DeGieckis in there,

[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.620]
but they got to exhale money at the end of the game.

[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:43.620]

[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:44.660]
No, wait a minute.

[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:45.320]
Wait a minute.

[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:45.780]
Yes, I did.

[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.500]
It was a great game.

[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.420]
You had no sense.

[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:48.220]
You watched that game.

[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:48.980]
I loved it.

[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:50.500]
I'm a sports fan, see?

[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:52.680]
Do you bet on hockey games?

[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:52.960]
No.

[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.320]
I watched a Michigan State Michigan,

[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.900]
because I went to Michigan State hockey game on that...

[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:57.680]
Oh, thank you, Mark.

[00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:58.500]
I think you would know that.

[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:01.100]
I mean, how can you bet on a hockey game?

[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:01.620]
What do you do?

[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.660]
You give so many goals?

[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.320]
You're the biggest lion in the world, Bird.

[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:06.500]
I saw the puck go into the net.

[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:08.900]
Are you serious?

[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.000]
The man admits though that he's not a sports fan.

[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:11.800]
He's just a gambler.

[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:12.440]
Who said that?

[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:13.520]
What you think is in your credit?

[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:14.520]
Didn't you just say that?

[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.320]
I don't bet on football.

[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.340]
It depends on the sport.

[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:16.760]

[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.800]
I don't bet baseball games like a watch baseball games all day long.

[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:20.040]
Ah.

[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.560]
So what you're saying, and I'm sure that Joe Robbie will like this a lot,

[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:25.640]
is that football is so boring that unless you got a bet on a game,

[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:26.740]
you would never watch it.

[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.000]
Football lends itself to betting more than any other sport.

[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.080]
Now, how can that be?

[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:31.340]
Why?

[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.780]
I have trouble watching football games without a bet.

[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:34.560]
I don't know what it is.

[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.420]
Is that always the case?

[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.740]
Or is it just in the last couple of years when it's become so mediocre?

[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:41.380]
No, I was actually started when I first got sick at the age of 16.

[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.180]
When he made his first bet, that's right.

[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.620]
Boy, you are bad.

[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.820]
You're going to have to have anything hot at the track this afternoon.

[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:48.940]
I haven't even looked at the form.

[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.040]
I just decided it goes.

[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.060]
That's the fur of the moment.

[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:51.360]
It's true.

[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.000]
It's hot there and just clothes rise.

[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.240]
Who's riding well out there?

[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.840]
Chavez is still going crazy in Verren's Waila.

[00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.900]
And they can tell us when they get hot.

[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:00.540]
They can tell us.

[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.140]
Well, yeah, they don't want to get carried away.

[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.400]
They don't want to make too much money and get into trouble.

[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.420]
A little scoop for you, if you want to have a bad horse racing.

[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:07.860]
Great.

[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.380]
Guaranteed to happen with this violation.

[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.500]
By the way, you've been seeing a crowded poppin'o last night.

[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:13.780]
Yeah, go ahead.

[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.880]
Oh, this deregulation thing marked my words.

[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:19.300]
Gulfstream is going to stick at the call.

[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.200]
They're real good over that breeder's cup business.

[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.860]
They will not stay open for just three days.

[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:27.460]
I think they're planning to run a lot more days in just the three.

[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:27.980]
Really?

[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:28.360]
Yeah.

[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:29.200]
What about Brunetti?

[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.060]
Is he still in business?

[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:31.980]
We haven't heard from Chal.

[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.240]
Actually, I got one of them.

[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:33.520]
They run.

[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:33.760]
I got one of them.

[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.300]
Secretary a couple days ago, asking for my home address.

[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.180]
They do have the best PR over there, don't they?

[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:38.880]
Well, they do now.

[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:39.200]
None.

[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:41.360]
The home address thing is kind of the tip off.

[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.340]
They don't have any PR at Hylia.

[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.280]
That's part of their problem.

[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.440]
But you know, we do know that those Latin's love horse racing, right?

[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:50.160]
That's the same crap I hear about while we ought to have major league baseball

[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.300]
because we have the big Latin pun.

[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:51.980]
I hear an issue.

[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.180]
Now, do you remember the Amigos?

[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.920]
See, you would remember the Amigos.

[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:56.620]
I know, but I broadcast their first game.

[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:57.120]
Did you?

[00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:57.400]
Yeah.

[00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:58.420]
You're one of the sunny.

[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:00.200]
You're one of a handful in this city.

[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.380]
No, the manager was?

[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:01.640]
No.

[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:02.440]
David Johnson.

[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:03.260]
Yeah.

[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.340]
That was until he started putting the pieces of his face back together again.

[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.980]
He looks a lot worse now than it's tough.

[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.080]
He's got the Michael Jackson.

[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.040]
We all know, the face is coming apart in the chest.

[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:15.620]
And they got four of the pieces.

[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:16.980]
That's why he had to come back for one more season

[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.180]
so they can get all the pieces of his face reconstructed.

[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.600]
Have you seen him lately?

[00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:21.800]
Seriously, David Johnson?

[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.160]
These guys are aging badly.

[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.800]
You and I are aging better than they are.

[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:25.700]
Many are old guys.

[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.280]
They're faces start falling apart.

[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:28.400]

[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:28.400]

[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.560]
You know what the baseball deal is, don't you?

[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.720]
I mean, where wise to that?

[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.320]
The movement.

[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:35.660]
You know, the baseball movement.

[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.400]
Don't say movement in this town on this station.

[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:41.460]
I mean, it gets a lot of people on the beach very excited when you say movement.

[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:42.400]
They get some optimistic.

[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:43.960]
It gets their hopes up.

[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.380]
Not much else they get up, but their hopes up.

[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.060]
Are you still happy here?

[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:48.760]
No, it's been about that.

[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.800]
After yesterday, well yesterday we had a traumatic day.

[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:51.600]
I guess you didn't hear, huh?

[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:52.660]
We don't want to go into it.

[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:53.160]
Where are we going?

[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:53.300]

[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:54.240]
We're on an airplane now.

[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.140]
We're really happy to have two seven times.

[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.180]
Well, I signed my contract.

[00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:59.280]
And once that happened, I will stick it to him.

[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.460]
And I will show him where I'm going to be.

[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:01.300]
What have they done?

[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.700]
Well, they just got a little carried away.

[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.000]
You know, but now they're okay.

[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.560]
They apologize profusely.

[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:06.840]
Everything that was embarrassing.

[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:10.760]
I mean, Disney was done as hands of these sobbing and crying and carrying on.

[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:11.680]
Please bring it up.

[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:14.120]
At the Christmas party, they were toasting you like you were saying.

[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:14.320]
Really?

[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.940]
Yeah, I'm still waiting for the first one.

[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:21.460]
Well, we were curious, Hank, how long the honeymoon period would last.

[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.920]
And we found out six weeks.

[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:25.820]
Yeah, six weeks is a pretty long time and it's not bad.

[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.800]
And of course, you know, you've had a real long honeymoon with this station.

[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.500]
It's been nothing but teaches and cream.

[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:32.560]
I've had so many ups and downs.

[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:34.120]
You're like, totally old and cold bird.

[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:34.580]
Do they?

[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:35.100]
Yeah.

[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.620]
So anyway, I got to do pennies at the place here.

[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:38.280]
But are you going to go?

[00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.000]
Patties place.

[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:39.400]
Yeah.

[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.500]
Next we are X-rated commercial, okay.

[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:43.100]
You got a commercial for Patties.

[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.680]
But luckily, this is not Tom Dennenberg's account because then Tom would be in there.

[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:48.900]
He gets a little, he's a little hyper.

[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:49.380]
You know Tom?

[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:49.960]
Yeah.

[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:50.680]
You know Tom mentioned.

[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:51.020]
Yeah.

[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:51.360]
Yeah.

[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:51.380]
Yeah.

[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:51.420]
Yeah.

[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:51.420]

[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:51.480]

[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:51.480]

[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:51.640]
Yeah.

[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:51.700]

[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:51.700]

[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:51.700]

[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:51.880]

[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:51.880]

[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:51.880]

[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:51.880]

[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:51.880]

[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:52.220]

[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:52.220]

[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:52.220]

[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:52.220]

[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:52.220]

[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:52.220]

[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:52.660]
Yeah.

[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:52.680]

[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:07.920]
Yeah.

[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:11.360]

[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:11.360]

[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:14.020]
Yeah.

[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:15.100]
Yeah.

[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:15.100]

[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:15.100]

[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:15.440]

[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:15.440]

[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:15.440]

[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:15.440]

[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:15.440]

[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:15.440]

[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:15.440]

[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:15.440]

[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:15.440]

[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:15.440]

[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:15.540]
Yeah.

[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:15.600]

[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:15.600]

[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:15.600]

[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:15.600]

[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:15.600]

[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:15.720]

[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:15.720]

[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:16.040]

[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:16.040]

[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:16.040]

[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:16.480]
Yeah.

[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:16.540]
Yeah.

[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:16.660]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:18.060]
He's getting ready to plunge his gut sets.

[00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:20.220]
So if you're looking for some hot tips today, stay away from Hank.

[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.940]
114, and here is an X-rated commercial for the D.

[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.520]
Oh, I know that the Zord even loves Neorodgers.

[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:27.880]
116 at the WIOD.

[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:29.840]
We wish Hank lots of luck out of this afternoon.

[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.220]
Believe me, he's going to need it.

[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:33.080]
I'm going to get out here this weekend.

[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.980]
I'm going to have a big plunging weekend on the holiday, you know, good.

[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:36.940]
Very, very good.

[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:37.760]
Let me think, spirit.

[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:40.300]
I mean, um, Pompano is tonight.

[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:41.440]
Let me get this all squared away.

[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:45.400]
Calder is going to be open Sunday, Christmas Day.

[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:51.520]
Yeah, now they're gonna be racing early a lot of times they do they race like I'm Thanksgiving day

[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:55.060]
They started at 11. Oh, yeah, we got to find out about that before the end of the show

[00:52:55.060 --> 00:53:00.880]
Yeah, and then they'll be open Monday this week, right? Because it's a holiday. They usually have a big holiday card

[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:02.680]
Right, mm-hmm

[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.580]
Yeah, you're just degrees with anything that I say

[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:12.340]
Okay, let's go to Miami next hello. I need you. How you doing? Okay, this is Chuckie. Hey, it's Chuckie in Miami

[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:16.720]
Yeah, it's been three days since I've called you so I guess I lost my chronic status

[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.340]
Let me ask you do you watch football Chuckie? Yes, I do now

[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:23.920]
Do you have to have a bet on every game that you watch? No, no, not all right. I bet you're not from New York, right?

[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:25.440]
No, I'm not see there you go

[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:30.600]
New Yorkers, man, they're just from the time they're born. They're just wild degenerates

[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.880]
I got a gamble on everything. Yeah, I know my dad from New York and he calls me up

[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:36.400]
If he doesn't have a bet on the game he goes, oh come on, I'll buck I'll buck

[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.640]
Hey, I never got to the point when Hank was in here

[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:44.200]
I was trying I got sidetracked. I was gonna talk about the networks and how blatant they encourage illegal gambling and when

[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.760]
Costas was telling the story when he had king on Sunday night

[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:51.220]
He's talking about the Tigers playing the Yankees or the Indians or somebody years ago and his father

[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:57.520]
Was gonna bet on the Tigers because somebody was pitching. I forget the big fat left-handed. What was his name? Oh?

[00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:04.020]
Oh, yeah, it's Mickey Lois and he said one of David Letterman used to make fun about and he says my dad picked up the phone and

[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:07.260]
Bet a thousand dollars and so now when he says he picked up the phone

[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.520]
All he said is he called his bookie. Okay, they never used the word

[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:17.480]
But that's what we're talking about is illegal gambling and the networks in this country have done and Hank does the same thing as much as I like

[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:23.500]
I mean, you know, he he promotes illegal gambling all these guys do and he just wink and laugh about it like it's a big joke

[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:25.000]
Now if the same thing were said well

[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:31.680]
They called the the escort service and they sent a hooker over right away people in sunrise would be you know having a meeting and having a nervous breakdown

[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:35.360]
I don't understand it. I mean, I think it should you should be able to bet on anything, okay?

[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:41.220]
That's true. That's true. They should have windows here. There you go. Exactly. I don't know when that window is right here in the station

[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.380]
It'll lower those damn lottery sales, too

[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:49.260]
That's for sure the biggest sucker bet in the history of mankind. You can't wait till Rebecca Paul is here next Wednesday filling in for

[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:55.960]
Renere I just can't wait because when at the end of that show I'm gonna nail her real good so to speak about his lottery man

[00:54:55.960 --> 00:55:01.160]
It's the biggest ripoff in history. Yeah, she's the she's the lottery chair person with a whip the lottery queen

[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:04.660]
Yeah, so that's a nail that movie Rayman was excellent

[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:13.000]
Excellent slick. Yeah, how could anybody not like it? There's only one thing I didn't like about it. Oh, geez Jamie Lee Curtis wasn't in it. Yeah, that's true. Yeah

[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:21.360]
Her hostile projectiles although I will say that you'd have probably been the butchest one in the movie, so yeah, it wouldn't have fit

[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:28.100]
Yeah, well bird Mary Christmas to you. Thank you, sir. And Neil happy scooker-cooker-vooker. Okay, I'm the same to you have a good one

[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:28.780]
Bye, boy

1119 at W. I. D. We have an open line in date if you move quickly now come on. Let's go

[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.320]
751 W. I. O. D.

[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:46.000]
And don't forget Reverend Dwight Porter. This is his 80th appearance this week on a cane show against atheist John O'Neal

[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.400]
And they're gonna be at debating is God Jewish

[00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:51.880]
And was he bar mitzvah

[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:56.860]
I thought they were to how about that loyal did he do a good job or not?

[00:55:56.860 --> 00:56:01.280]
Should you celebrate Christmas? I think they're gonna get into that now it's gonna be should go and celebrate Tisha boy

[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:03.960]
With Reverend Dwight Porter

[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:12.920]
And atheist John O'Neal just to get you in that holiday spirit. Okay, we want you to feel good and full of love and brotherhood and hate etc

[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:19.160]
Plantation hello. Yeah, Neil. Yeah, I'm a police officer. I'm Brad. I've been here about 10 years and 79

[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:23.320]
I just want to make a couple of points with you. Yeah, I'm not gonna be so narrow-minded to

[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.340]
Think that there's only a few you know, please also. Well, I didn't mind that he wanted to say that

[00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:31.560]
But he was getting hysterical and I couldn't have any kind of a conversation with him. I agree with you

[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:31.980]
but

[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:40.040]
The major issue that I wouldn't take is since I guess in the late mid 70s the standards have been lowered greatly used to be

[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.640]
You have to have me an excellent military person

[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:44.840]
21 now as he pointed out that the

[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:50.040]
Spanners are dropping so the way the society is changing some of these people are not as quite as mature

[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:55.900]
The temptations probably but you know what that's like saying they would be like saying the standards for being a brain surgeon are dropping

[00:56:55.900 --> 00:57:00.540]
Okay, when you give somebody the power of life and death and you you know by law

[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:07.100]
And you put that gun in their hands and you say it's legal and now you've got this extra supernatural power that nobody else has

[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:11.420]
You can't just say well, you know, we're gonna lower the standards out. That's not acceptable

[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:16.160]
Well, I understand that and it's not acceptable in the amongst ranks the professional police officers now whatever

[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:22.340]
Federal government and the guidelines that step in in order to get some of these people to begin the minorities and the

[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:26.100]
This Hispanics that came in the in the bolus and stuff they come into this country

[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:32.540]
They had to drop the standards to because we were being unfair by having a severe amount of math in the testing programs

[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:37.340]
And as a result you get substandard police officers into the job that

[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.320]
Should not be in there as a result you had the incident when you have a Miami River Cops

[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:45.020]
Unfortunately, it's not saying that you know the Spanish are

[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:49.660]
Or bad. It's just to happen be that all of them happen to be Hispanics in that case

[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:58.020]
Well, let's be honest about it. There have been an inordinate number of Latin police officers who've been involved in

[00:57:58.020 --> 00:57:59.620]
drugs and

[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:02.840]
Other criminal activity and inordinate number in Dave County

[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:07.020]
You're right. There have been and there have been someone and that's not an ethnic remark

[00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:10.800]
It's just a matter of fact for whatever the reason that just happens to be the case

[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:14.660]
A lot of that though, I've seen that from inside looking at it a tribute to the

[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:18.080]
The standards that have used now in the hiring criteria

[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:23.500]
I mean, yes, you say you just like a logical testing whatever you but that doesn't you know do you any good until

[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:29.000]
Somebody shows a deviant character on that well first of all the psychological testing is a joke in the

[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.660]
the psychologist I can't remember his name

[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:35.240]
But I had him on a show a few years ago who is in charge of the whole program in Dave County

[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:39.040]
He admits that it's a farce that they really can't determine ahead of time

[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:44.980]
Just exactly where these guys are coming from right. It's only good as a standard when somebody does something wrong

[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:45.880]
Yeah, you know

[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:50.520]
The only thing I want to point out mostly since it's been on our negative lately again

[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:55.520]
Today district five the FOP here in the regional Brad where out there passing out

[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:58.200]
Christmas baskets for the needy out there

[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.360]
Along with the fire department and several other

[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:03.300]
Associations and concerns citizens out there

[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:08.220]
They're also out there involved in what a charitable event such as the upcoming pigball

[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:16.120]
Uh, the January 21st, which is against the lawyers and the police and that's also for charity and the money

[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:22.100]
I think was raised about 30,000 last year give or take him exactly how much but somewhere in that neighborhood for the charitable

[00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:25.140]
Visitions and a lot of that goes unnoticed

[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:29.020]
Certainly we get headlines when we have an incident like happened recently in Miami

[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:34.640]
But we certainly don't get to headlines when we're out there doing the job that

[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:39.560]
It goes unnoticed and the only other thing that I had to say

[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:40.840]
Of reference

[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:48.100]
That that's the highlight of it is that everybody has an opinion of what the police officer's job ought to be

[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:53.520]
Uh, no one has an opinion is how the doctors should do this job or the law. Oh, sure they do sure they do

[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:53.940]
I do

[00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:59.540]
But they not the general public they all can tell you this is what the police officers should do

[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:02.180]
Yeah, I have my opinion they should do this they should do that

[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:06.460]
But you don't see him going to the doctor tell the doctor how to operate you don't see him telling the

[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.700]
brain surgeon how to do this or the

[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:13.900]
The uh preacher out of preach but you all out there, you know without walking a mile in the shoe

[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.500]
Right? Well, you know, it just it's just a matter of time

[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:22.140]
I mean I you certainly wouldn't say the public has a great confidence in lawyers would you I wouldn't think they probably have a great confidence

[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:26.800]
They don't they don't and they're in their confidence in doctors is diminishing every day

[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.160]
Just like their confidence in police officers keep diminishing when they see how many this on his cops

[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.900]
There are how much corruption is going on

[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:38.940]
Uh, this is human nature. I mean people you can fool them for a long time by putting on a uniform and the you know

[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:40.860]
perpetrating this this fraud

[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:44.260]
Which is really what doctors do because they got a white coat on or a white outfit then

[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:48.720]
Automatically the public is opposed to assume they know what they're doing and I still think most doctors

[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.420]
Haven't got the foggiest idea what they they couldn't diagnose a head cold most of them okay

[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.320]
True, I agree with that but

[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.000]
On the most part

[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:59.940]
Majority opinion or the people they always have an opinion

[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:04.420]
Glant it you know where well yeah most people you know they have an opinion how I should do this show too

[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:08.560]
Okay, the only differences people don't die from this show. We don't shoot anybody on the show

[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.320]
Well, and we don't beat anybody to death on this show

[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:18.880]
No, although it has happened yeah, yeah, I'm not saying it doesn't but I'm just saying that

[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:24.720]
We all have a front line out there and it's not so much the law enforcement is deteriorating obviously

[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.340]
But the court system itself is deteriorating well the whole systems thinks I mean

[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:34.100]
Let's be honest about the system is pathetic this this story out in Texas with this judge this redneck judge

[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:40.740]
That just gave the lenian sentence to these two guys who murdered the two gay guys because and he says he gave the lenian sentence

[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:46.120]
Because he doesn't like queer is running around cruising trying to pick up teenagers or whatever the story was

[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.780]
And they had a big scene out there and you know, he says well

[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:52.480]
I'm not gonna worry about it two years from now when I'm up for reelection nobody will remember anyway

[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.160]
I mean what kind of justice is that?

[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.260]
It's no just

[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.120]
Well, listen, it's good talking to you and I'm glad we could have a rational conversation

[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.480]
Well, I appreciate your time. I just want to point out some of the good things that going out there as well

[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.480]
Okay, thanks a lot

[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:08.280]

[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:07.360]
He never had this much notoriety when the dean was here, huh? That's what she claimed

The walk of a slam

[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:02.260]

[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.860]

The Christmas to me means

[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:14.700]
Family

[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:16.580]
Your family means friends

[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:20.340]
The friends means getting together and getting together means

[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:21.980]
Eaton

[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:25.320]
All past me that's on the day. Which place? Well, flaky. I'm more

[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:28.720]
Not just a little slater you're right now

[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.980]
You know, I may be a big star. Maybe too big

[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:35.280]
But ain't nobody's so big you can't reach out a helping hand

[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.020]
I'm helping a hand

[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:42.000]
Well, would you hand me a helping those my data's over there? Which I believe?

[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:43.480]
It's like it. I got it right

[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:50.460]
Now like I was playing nobody's so big you can stoop to help a friend of neat over the holiday season

[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:52.080]
I'm speaking of season

[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.080]
Won't pass me that soul sugar when you get the chance like yeah, just just those screw the color

[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.400]

[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.740]
So this Christmas, I don't y'all take a tip from old

[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:02.820]

No, I appreciate it. Thank you. I want you to remember for all part of God's great big family

[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:14.200]
You know God made man unto his own image

[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:19.700]
You're looking the mirror. I'd have to say God must be a big big sin of a gun. You know what I mean?

[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:20.920]
I like you do

[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:24.020]
But I especially want y'all to remember this one last thing

[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:28.560]
When y'all this home was Christmas springing that popcorn up on the tree

[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.760]

[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.520]
Extra butter to my

Well, that's lurping sounds real familiar to not one 38 at W I O D

[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.660]
At our next call now. I'm gonna try this again, but I have my dots. It says again

[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.360]
Employee of a major convenience store. Hello

[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:52.740]
Hello, yes

[01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:54.460]
Uh-huh. Hello

[01:11:54.940 --> 01:12:00.700]
What's happening? Not much. Okay. I got a question a couple questions for you. If you don't mind. Yeah

[01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:08.260]
Okay, uh, I'm over here in between the pompano deer field border and uh, I've been thinking about the Camilla South a lot

[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:14.480]
There are I'd have to say 25 to 50 I guess I'll call them street people

[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.540]
They just live around here, but in the shopping center

[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:21.480]
Is there any place closer than the Camilla South that could help these people?

[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:26.560]
Yeah, there's a place in uh, Broward. I'm trying to think of the name. We did some things for him a couple of years ago

[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:27.660]
What is the name of the um?

[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.200]
It's not the daily food bank. There's um

[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:34.880]
Somebody will call it and tell me I don't remember the name of it. Oh great because they kind of I feel formed

[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:40.300]
They just walk around all day long with their garbage bags and yeah, it's really sad and the second question

[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.620]
And I'll just wish you all Merry Christmas is

[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:50.440]
Wait a minute isn't that the Delavos shelter is that it? That could be I think that's it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's great. Appreciate the information

[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:54.280]
We're thinking strongly about going to see the uh

[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.840]
The movie you've been talking about all day

[01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:04.820]
Rainman rainman and is it appropriate for a 10 and 11 year old child? Absolutely. Okay, because they would really like to go in there

[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:08.300]
I mean, there's a little bit of language in there, but nothing they don't hear at home. Yeah. Oh, yeah

[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:15.300]
Of course rated pg movies are worse than most of the already. Yeah. Okay. I appreciate the information to have a happy holiday

[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:19.800]
You too. Thanks. One 40 see I told you there was somebody good there on the convenience store

[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.100]

[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:28.060]

Rogers of course my favorite

[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:40.040]
Long-long time listener and I haven't called in uh about three years good

[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:42.040]
When you were at wins

[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.480]
Not so good ticket ass

[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:49.140]
Um one thing two things as a matter of fact one of course uh

[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:55.880]
I didn't listen to yesterday. It was uh very busy and um somebody told me I think it was Donna

[01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:04.420]
Very funny, sir. Oh, very funny. I guess you want this to be a short call. No, no, please don't dump me

[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:11.920]
No, you're not leaving. Are you? No, okay, everything's everything's so sure nobody ever said I was leaving. We just had a little

[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:18.500]
We're misunderstood a little simmiss here yesterday and they got a little emotional and did some stupid things and they have a

[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:23.780]
Apologized and for the 80th time this week and I said don't you ever do it again

[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:29.180]
Just cut the crap and mind your own business and get out of my life and they will they have all right all right

[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:31.160]
That's great. There's last question

[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.820]
What is if you can and I you know no more issues

[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:38.280]
No, but one question what is his federal

[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:47.560]
Great. What is the federal communications up to with this jessy film thing that Paul know when you just relax for the all the bill says

[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:54.820]
They've already passed the ruling before and they made an exception and they said from midnight to six in the morning in decent speech is okay

[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.140]
Now they're saying because jessy helms stuck that thing into a

[01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:00.200]
A funding bill in congress

[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:05.860]
Not this thing that they have to go by that and they're going to enforce it 24 hours a day. It doesn't affect anything

[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:08.200]
It'll affect some of the stuff you'd see on tv

[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:13.860]
But they already are saying that it's unconstitutional. It's never going to hold up the broadcasters are going to challenge it in court

[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:15.980]
So I wouldn't worry about it. Well, there it is

[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:20.600]
It's just what you'd expect from an eanderthal right wing douchebag like jessy helms, okay?

[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:22.860]
You bet and one more thing your producers

[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:30.580]
Nobody has said this but your producer is a great guy wonderful American that is correct have a nice day both of you have a happy holiday

[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:33.700]
And you two and don't come again for another three years, okay?

[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:36.000]

[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:34.380]
Oh, they don't in the news now the news doesn't have good racing charts. It's big

[01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:39.380]
It's big. Well, that's because they got two days in here that they squeeze in you know

[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:44.960]
Have the herald sports that we don't have it. Well, I think it now we had it because I looked in there for the apompti

It's that check for a thousand dollars. I'll be damned from frank. I thank you very very much

[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:39.860]

[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:44.140]
Thank you Frank here. Take the check. I don't want nice shirt. I want to hang on to that

[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:48.600]
Thank you Frank from the bottom of our heart. So that raises our total now

[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:50.300]
What happened to my pen?

[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:52.020]

[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:14.260]
851 bucks. Oh easy. So that's not too bad. You need to handle that right

[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:45.980]
You're doing this time of the afternoon char hut where they serve real food

Man, they want to give it to you your way for real never any preservatives or additives

[01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:19.920]
They don't coat their char-burel chicken with any mung on the outside to cover up what you're getting

[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:25.200]
You see exactly what you're getting fresh delicious chicken and Italian sausage burgers fries

[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.120]
Hi Neil. Hi. How are you doing great? How's life treating you? Well better than it was yesterday

[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.460]
Really? Yeah, we had a bad day here yesterday

[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:46.320]
We had some people who were up changing their underwear every two seconds. I didn't get a chance to listen to yesterday

[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:48.880]
So I don't know thank God

[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:53.320]
How you doing Bart? Fine you missed a hell of a show. I did

[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:58.220]
Yeah, well, um, this has been the first week that I've been able to listen to all four hours last week

[01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:01.260]
I was laid off for my job. They had a lot of people go. Oh boy

[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:05.480]
And you mean you mean right before Christmas? They let people go. Yeah, it's never a night

[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.760]
Boy sounds like why 100 today?

[01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:10.780]
No, it wasn't why 100 but it was close

[01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:11.420]
Um

[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:16.820]
Hopefully my next job I'll get to listen to you when I was working there. They wouldn't let me listen to you

[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:20.200]
Why is that? Um, we had to listen to the motivation station

[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:29.140]
Can you tell us what kind of a place it was? Oh, yeah, it was a computer company. Oh, yeah, yeah, highly motivated no doubt

[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:30.960]
No, yeah, so you know you've learned so much

[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:32.280]
Who are they kidding? Yeah

[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:39.060]
How's your blessings? Count your blessings now when Earl Nightingale came on did everything stop like in the office

[01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:41.840]
Everybody stop typing. I think you put everybody

[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:44.680]
Yeah, they stopped all right. They went into a coma

[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:51.160]
Yeah, I said well, why can't we listen to Neil? He says well because you won't learn anything if you listen to the motivation station

[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:55.900]
You'll get more motivated. Yeah, that's what Larry King says, man. You got to be informed and entertained at the same time

[01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:59.160]
That's why I'm listening to that math maker tonight, man. I won't

[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:03.220]
Well, that Leo Biscale you know

[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:08.480]
Well, I just called to speak both the happy holiday. Well, same to you and I hope you find something better than that

[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:14.840]
Insanity you were in I know well, hopefully I'll get you know my next job I'll get to listen to you because when I don't get to listen

[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:18.960]
Do I get really depressed? I don't blame him. Okay, listen have a great one. Bye. Bye. Bye

[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:25.900]
Okay, here's a rainman report. There he is star of stage screen and extra curricular activities mr. Cain

[01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:31.340]
In the holiday spirit today is gonna have a um rabbi a Jew and a atheist

[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:34.960]
Now he doesn't have a rabbi today. We banned the rabbi from the cane show

[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:40.480]
But we have Reverend Dwight Porter and atheist John O'Neill are gonna go 10 rounds with no gloves gonna be great

[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:46.940]
Let's go to we have a rainman report in date county. Hello. Hi Neil. This is the ass we're going in

[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:50.900]
Yeah, I went to see rainman the other night. Oh, no, it was what?

[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:55.760]
I was great. Okay, fantastic Dustin Hoffman is very versatile

[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:04.380]
I loved it and I cried during the same scene that you did when when he uh when he hit his Charlie's head when Raymond and

[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.780]
Charlie hit heads. Yeah, that was where I cried too

[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:12.420]
It was definitely touching. Yeah, don't say head on this show sir some people get very upset

[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:13.320]
Ha ha ha

[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:19.420]
Hey, um, I'm I'm my delivery here at work. I go out on kibis game. Do you go out there much?

[01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:24.960]
Kibis game. Oh, yeah, I go there every day. Well don't you think I never go to kibis game. What would I do out there?

[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:26.020]
I don't know

[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:30.360]
But if you've ever been out there, you'll see that there are a lot of fossils that are living out there

[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:35.440]
I think they should have assigned above the entrance that should say retirement community. Yeah, fossil alert

[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:40.860]
Definitely mm-hmm, but um we don't get as a matter of fact, you know with all this money that we get

[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:44.200]
I don't really have a chance to look at all the addresses because there's somebody checks and things

[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:48.100]
Very rarely once in a blue moon do we get anything once in a blue here?

[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:52.800]
Do we get anything from kibis game? Okay, and I know that's a lot of poor people out there. They can't afford it

[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:56.460]
But they they sure aren't too loose with the bucks out there

[01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:59.460]
Right. There must be a lot of french canadians living there probably

[01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:04.920]
Well, they got a they've got a speed limit out there 45 miles per hour, which I always exceed because it's too slow

[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:10.340]
But uh sometimes I get behind an old folk that's in a car doing the speed limit or below it

[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:14.380]
And uh, so yeah, there's nothing like getting behind a car where they're doing it. Yeah

[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:18.080]
But one day when I was behind such a car

[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:22.220]
I thought of a question that they should have on a driving on a driving test

[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:26.120]
Um that if you come up behind a car doing below the speed limit

[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:31.040]
What should you look for in the car in front of you to know whether you should pass the answer gray hair

[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:36.480]
Blue hair or gray here at all depends see there's a difference you can if it's blue hair you're probably enbroured

[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.800]
Uh-huh, it's gray here. You're in date true

[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:43.760]
But uh, and if it's kind of like purple hair, you're probably on keep his gain right well

[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:48.380]
I can put down old people, but I have an old grandfather did turn 97 last Friday

[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.300]
And uh, but he keeps to himself. He's not like the old bad guy here good. Let him keep to himself

[01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:58.360]
Let's you tell him keep it that way. Uh, I mean, you know, he isn't opinionated and calling radio stations

[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:05.320]
Like the comment down here. Yeah. Oh, that's good. Don't get him a phone. Whatever you do. Right. Okay. Listen have a great holiday

[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:07.660]
Okay, you too. Bye. Okay. Bye. Bye

[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:14.740]
157 at WIO D boy. This has been pretty painless today, you know, I must say analyzing it from the rear of the show

[01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:20.660]
Uh, it's been you know, okay little more in the spirit people actually been saying very Christmas and stuff

[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:24.940]

Life crisis there in the middle of the show and then it really went nuts. Yeah true did tell us hour and a half wow

[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:36.440]
Excuse my

[01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:43.120]
Getting emotional in motions anyway. I'm gonna be glued to the radio on the way home because I want to hear Reverend Porter

[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.020]
I haven't heard him at least a two or three days

[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:52.340]
Talk about a chronic guest man. Oh man. I wasn't this the guy who's like ultra right wing. I'm sure he is

[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.540]
Ultra right wing homophobic
