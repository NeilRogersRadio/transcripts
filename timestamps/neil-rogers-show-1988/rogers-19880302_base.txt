[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]
Number one knows more about ratings than any man in South Florida. Okay. Well, let's punch him up immediately. Hello

[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.320]
Hey, oh, congratulations on your anniversary. Hey, here's the gentleman the a phantom who was missing yesterday

[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.360]
Nothing yesterday, but I

[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.580]
Appreciate your calling and again. I want to wish a happy anniversary 12 successful years

[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.100]
Thank you so much Lee. It's a good time to hang it up isn't it?

[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.640]
Why push my luck now not at all? You've got you've got other mountains to climb. Yeah, I know you're gonna be like

[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.540]
Visiting a five nine to a six one when this book is oh

[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:40.140]
I'm serious boy. You're in a dream world, babe. No, no, absolutely not you've been hanging out with fruitcake again Lee

[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.140]
I think so

[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.680]
Absolutely not and you are also you also turned out to be quite a profit because you predicted the downfall of

[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.580]
W. I.m. V didn't I really yeah, I've been saying that well listen to you have to be a genius all you got to do is turn it on and listen for 10 minutes

[00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.180]
And you know immediately the story there well, you know Gary Lawrence has two two options open he can fire Mark

[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.420]
Yoon

[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.540]
Or he can wait till his successor comes in and fires Mark you oh

[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.380]
That was an interesting now that was a profound statement ladies and gentlemen

[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.140]
I want you to analyze that I want you to think very carefully

[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.240]
Like that radio state that was an interesting way that you put lead that out for us then go ahead to late mr.

[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.740]
Cune destroyed W. I. O. D. and he's doing the same thing with I in there

[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.240]
Yeah, like I said he's a nice guy like if he would set up a hot dog stand a subrace

[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.540]
No, no seriously

[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.240]
I really mean to like I said the other day because when you see Mark you really feel a lot of sympathy for him and

[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.860]
Everybody even if they were full if they had just eaten they would still pull over say come on

[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.580]
Let's buy a couple of hot dogs from Mark. He'd probably make some serious bucks doing that

[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.740]
What is it to all that god only knows he keeps tinkering and tampering with success

[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.960]
In fact, haven't you heard me in the past say the slogan on this place is mess with success

[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.300]
What I was doing a nine share they were messing around all you shouldn't do this and

[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:57.280]
I'm a map you know you had almost a 10 share of 2554. I know and now they're down to a two four

[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:05.140]
I know well that Dr. Vots boy. He's really performing. He's performed quite a lobotomy on that audience hasn't he and and stand sounds just

[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.540]
You know he just sounds so full of despair. Yeah, well hopefully that he's got a bit of all his chronic hangars on

[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.360]
He might make a little he might bounce back a little

[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.020]
Well, he was fooling around of course as you mentioned Kane has made his move. Oh, yeah, here we go

[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.300]
Here's a here he is ladies gentlemen

[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.200]
Public defender of citizen Kane public defender number one you got to be 25% of the audience wait a minute

[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.820]
Can I say something to you as is a as a as a stupe radio observer of the passing broadcast scene you must realize that these rolling numbers

[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:42.900]
Include months that are going to disappear now the IOD November and December Gustup exaggerated dolphin months are going to disappear

[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.680]
When January February and March are left to stand all on their own you following me Lee I follow and I have a feeling that the incredible

[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.580]
The overstated especially reneering in the morning and Mr. Paine in the afternoon

[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.220]
You're gonna see you're gonna see some regression there come February okay when the February numbers come out

[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.400]
Yeah, I'm predicted on your show at all sincerity. I mean Michael the system was going to take over the dominance of a.m. Talk

[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.340]
I got news for you Steve wait wait a minute. Wait a minute. Steve is gonna take over the dominance of a.m. Talk and let's let's get

[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.120]
Out the Montevati records in

[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.560]
He's the one they call for the Oprah show. He's the one wait a minute when I turned them down

[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.760]
He's the one that they call okay. I turned down the Oprah show. I've turned down crossfire three times

[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.060]
We encouraged them to call him okay

[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.020]
Because the guy's got an ego bigger than Mount Everest. So let's feed it

[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.940]
But when people you know nationally think of target this market they think if Steve Kane no, I hate to break the news

[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.260]
Yeah, I really do, but I think that you're leaving somebody out okay?

[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.140]
I'm talking about a.m. Oh, yeah, I'm absolutely

[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.740]
I've died I I had to team far and away the the number one radio personality in this whole market

[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.940]
Yeah, you say that again Lee the number one radio

[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.780]
Okay, okay without eight down you on the shadow of a doubt well

[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.980]
How come then Steve has this problem? Okay? Why doesn't he want to admit that?

[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.600]
Why is he so paranoid and petty and jealous? He's making a lot of money

[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.760]
He's got no show over there. He doesn't have to work too hard because they don't have time for any show

[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.820]
He's bringing back the same boring guest and contrived controversy and yet you continue to be public defender number one

[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.080]
I mean Michael the sisto the

[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.460]
Lieberman the jahoba's witnesses

[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.360]
Look what scientific creationist wrestlers look what's like any couple more prediction. Oh my god

[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.140]
Good okay

[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.320]
Well, what that big right now who's gonna be doing that show sit down for this one. Okay, Mike Miller will return

[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.040]
You will continue his thesis on whether new coke or all co

[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.980]
You need me in the punch that was gonna be my next question. That was gonna be my very next question

[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:56.300]
Are you drinking Jerry coke or regular coke caffeine-free or with and you know that will get

[00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.780]
Just add to the would they call themselves the weather station now? I don't know if you've caught that yeah, they sure are

[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.780]
Have the question is whether anybody is listening

[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.400]
Hey, look at this. Lee is coming up with lines now that he's got on the air if you want to come up with these while you're on the air

[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.640]
Maybe it's still be over there. Dale if I was

[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.080]
Whomever against you. I didn't have a chance. That's true. I didn't have a chance

[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.720]
But I enjoyed the fight you notice it's interesting when Alice has any competition

[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.060]
He crumbles under the pressure. You notice that that he is

[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.820]
He is really one of the victims of all of these changes, and I mean that sincerely out. I like al very much

[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.100]
He's a nice guy, but you know, he's in the twos the two fives. Yeah

[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.060]
What do they do to help them they add more business shows?

[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.260]
They add more news more traffic and not only that but the signal is dissipated so badly now that I really some days

[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.900]
I wonder if they're on the air just faking it. Yeah, that's right

[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.780]
And if they weren't no one wouldn't no one would notice right away

[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.460]
Here comes the guy who fills our machines in a kitchen. I wonder if he brought any home in Tasha

[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.400]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.560]
I kind of day looks pretty good to me. I doubt it by the way, Mr. Fowler

[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.420]
It's Diet Coke no caffeine just for the record. Okay, I had Coke no caffeine

[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.960]
And what about the rumor that ed till god forbid is gonna be doing middays at IOD

[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.020]
Well that that rumor persists

[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.160]
A contract was sent to him, but he's trying to find somebody to explain what a mean story. Yeah, I believe they

[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.440]
Maybe he can call maybe he can call John Levitt up in Palm Beach and John can interpret it for him

[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.520]
other exciting you know another exciting news is that

[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.080]
uh... time like us is very unhappy and feeling really well good let's bring

[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.580]
a back here you can do another pornographic dating show

[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.540]

[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.140]
to buy a house he can just be one

[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.400]

winter olympics ratings down here generally run about five day percent lower than

with your capabilities can't behave yourself because i think you have so much

[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.300]
joy for the community if you just stay in line

[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:16.040]
okay thank you so much

[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.960]
in spite of it a lot why can't you stay in line i know that's the best part

[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.000]
i'm impatient i like standing online honey by the way we've had such an

[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.340]
incredible response from our new york friends that is he walking they'd

[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.820]
dog this morning all i've crap i played from w a b c i thought we'd have an

[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.540]
outpouring if he ever puts it through in here this is exciting

[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.140]
there it goes i can't believe it like magic right mic right mic

[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.580]
that's absolutely correct what is it difficult getting in such a

[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.320]
huge i know that's because we're so popular

[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.840]
guys certainly are popular listen i just wanted to say thank you uh

[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.300]
you know for the listening last night i'll call it up and uh

[00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.480]
telling you about what went on and uh if you think it'd be unemployed again

[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.380]
you're not unemployed now this wasn't your job come on oh i know that i know

[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.840]
looking for a seat not even on the year anymore is looking for sympathy but no i

[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.100]
think it is pretty rude they uh they send you on your way you've been in the

[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.180]
market for 13 years now that's right and of course anybody who ever listen to

[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.680]
mic would never believe that but anyway the 13 years in a business and uh

[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.860]
mic's a good friend and a great humanitarian now seriously he's done a lot of

[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:25.820]
really good things and he gets preempted for uh ethyl blum the total nerd

[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.680]
brain without travel show waiting in the wings i don't think ethyl is going to be

[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.580]
i think it's high test rather than ethyl uh i think it's gonna be uh i think the

[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:39.140]
planned guy uh oh no are you serious that's serious and then uh

[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:44.040]
Steve Conway from 10 to 2 Steve Conway the guy that sounds like a little boy

[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.120]
shame i mean they're wonderful kids but jeez to be so dumb is to come on the year and announce

[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.300]

oh did you really yeah i guess uh what do you mean you went away

[00:14:54.580 --> 00:15:00.480]
guys have to embarrass himself people from Cooper City why can't you have uh both of them for what

[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.680]
you know so the audience can rag on them or ask the many questions that they want to ask

[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.220]
you all about okay that's good that's a good idea we'll bring him in here one of these

[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.860]
days if he's agreeable to it see i don't ordinarily don't like those ask the program director things

[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.560]
because they're corny and they're just the stupid yeah one hundred doesn't well yeah

[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.700]
he's gonna try yeah maybe if we ever get a 10-year-old program director like why 100 you would do it

[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:28.120]
i love those commercials there's just a great hey we can't we ask you what you want to do

[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:32.900]
with it well there are a reason i only reason i like the commercials is there a couple of people in

[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:37.080]
the spots who are really interesting but you only see them very briefly yeah you know what i mean

[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:43.940]
okay listen have a great day all right Neil it's great uh great uh i'm 48 minutes it's been good

for you okay i'll see you in Asia all right okay we got some Asia like in Siberia we don't play

[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:54.360]
Asia on this station do we we've got three cuts but we don't play him do we i think so we do

[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:59.240]
i don't know the past few weeks but months ago uh-huh are they right next to the

[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:04.660]
uh davidly Rothkatz just tell me okay but north cuba date county hello

[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:10.700]
let's get to the important stuff why does this um tell me a few days ago you talking about the ratings

[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:15.560]
how much did you beat tr by let's see we had a four one and they had a three one

[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.680]
on which age group that's 12 plus and in 25 to 54 we had a five six and they had a four two

[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.520]
you killed them yeah we destroyed them we wiped them out are they second or was it somebody in between

[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:29.080]
oh no they weren't second and we're even close to being second we have a bunch of stations in between

[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.660]
but are you talking you know like why 100 you're talking justations that uh nobody would listen to like

[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:38.260]
what what's that you like you what are we talking about no no i'm talking about stations like

[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:44.820]
y 100 and waxy and um gloves 94 they're way down the line oh yeah gtr is in a flat spin man they're

[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:49.040]
dropping like an atomic bomb over hero shimam tonne i think the reason is because the other show is

[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.780]
really you know other than yourself there's the only ones that have any to me any ability at all

[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:58.220]
but they don't do anything they're never on all he do is i've got a jukbox over there i don't

[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.420]
think they're funny to begin with to be honest with you some of the situation we're funny well what's

[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.360]
it a great while but i mean who wants to listen for four hours and you know hoping on a wing in a

[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:10.600]
prayer that today we might hear something entertaining yeah but uh they're they're just not on

[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.500]
they got a jukbox you know and they have that stupid promo that says a hermitemic bean and music

[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.200]
in the morning what a novel concept which is basically like saying you know they're hanging around

[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.280]
here but we're playing a ton of music the reason they're saying that basically because everybody you

[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.800]
know this sounds as you've come on and turned to talk basically yeah well yeah see but joy of course

[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.080]
is going to be on of their soon unfortunately we like him to stay forever but that just can't go on

[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:35.400]
forever and she is playing more music they're making joy play more music you gotta bring back

[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:43.200]
Jimmy and Steve who Jimmy and Steve I mean yet you have a death wish for them all together don't you

[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.100]

[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.020]

[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:14.020]
i don't have it in in front of me but i think waxy had about a five five and gloves had a four seven

[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:19.440]
and gtr had a four two and uh basically they're not going to roll mark the gtr's hurting once put it that way

[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.280]
gtr's beginning to hurt and she is dead in the water and uh we're slowly but surely making some

[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.740]
out it's a Friday morning and i would suggest if you're listening to the show in a car right now any

[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:12.620]
kind of a vehicle uh we're doing our own little survey here in fact we hired away the program

[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:17.660]
director from y100 that ten-year-old kid and he's out there counting headlights so turn on those

[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:22.980]
headlights flash him real nice now and uh that'll indicate to everybody around you that you're

[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:29.140]
listening to zeta four okay that spot that they are running is the most insipid stupid thing if

[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:33.720]
you stopped and really thought about what it says oh yeah now they won't play the same record

[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:40.340]
twice in an hour i think no no that's not what he says he says you won't hear the same song every

[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:45.300]
hour now what does that mean can you explain that to me it means what i just said that they won't

[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:51.060]
play the same song twice a one hour that's what it means but that's not what are you i know i know

[00:20:52.860 --> 00:21:02.200]
he says we won't play the same song every hour that's what it means yeah now you you are aware that

[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:08.560]
this entire um series of spots you know they're sequels right they ask for your input

[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.780]
then they come back and you know they've taken your input now here's what they're going to do

[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.240]
i mean you zeta my me beach fort lotterdale in the palm beaches it's five fifty eights yes

[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:23.360]
well these were all done at the beginning that's what my point is these were all done at the

[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.980]
beginning they were all done at one time you are aware of that speaking of what nothing

[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.480]
did you have an idea there no that's okay

[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:40.420]
okay be moody and all that kind of stuff i can't help it i was gonna let you play it

[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:47.420]
are you sure now later okay oh that's good now he's turning his own pot down didn't hear that that's

[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.980]
sounded really good are you gonna talk into that mic that's up on the ceiling there or what

[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.840]
now now we're gonna make a pledge too okay we're not gonna play the same song twice in one hour

[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:03.880]
okay you think rosefolders already in the car with our fascist sympathizer general manager

[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:13.100]
we could only five fifty nine okay now let me ask you a question what it gets to be like six o'clock

[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:17.380]
like a couple of seconds afterward would that be not playing the same song twice in the same hour

[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:22.680]
absolutely correct you absolutely got see that's what they're gonna do kids and why 100 they're

[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:28.100]
gonna play like michael jackson some real wimpy michael jackson record about four minutes of the

[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:32.440]
hour and then they'll come on with some big i'd you know a whole big song of dance and then they'll

[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:38.220]
play it again at like a minute after the hour also you can have a cap and a do is big i'de here

[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:43.320]
yeah and that's a good idea and then you could play it right after but maybe i should play because

[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:48.640]
it it is kind of what you're talking is it good well it's it's an air check that we got from y 100

[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:56.580]
i think some all great let's hear that i can't wait getting near the top of the hour with

[00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:05.360]
funny socks on zeta 4 wcta my name is for a lot of the farm vices radio station where we don't

[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:58.280]
kuper city high allegedly the seniors are having a skip day on monday that's the rumor we can get

[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.360]
some verification on that before the show is over and they're going to be out here in front of the

[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:08.280]
window perading around in their bathing suits young ladies and men young men and ladies and some

[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.660]

for in date county now it is interesting that they're already like four lines lit up which is pretty

[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:38.880]
good right but i do remember back on a m do you remember the days when lines used to flash without

[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.380]
the numbers just automatically and we would just punch them up every day and then somebody came

[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:48.300]
along started doing a screenless Thursday which i thought was an incredibly original idea

[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:57.880]
in a date county six two oh 3600 that six two oh 3600 and it bowered seven seven nine 3600 now what

[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.380]

heaven yes indiana's ball 30 seconds while waiting already taking good care of brunch

[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:39.040]
and you notice by the way the spots the desperation is some of the radio stations in this market

[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:43.380]
I watched the apromo last night for y100 with a 10 year old program director

[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:49.260]
and there are all these big momentous announcements from all these momentous FM radio stations on

[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:54.740]
almost a daily basis now and the new one is we're not going to play the same music every hour

[00:29:54.740 --> 00:30:00.140]
that's something you need that's what he said isn't that great did he really so the thing that

[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:03.780]
Glenn was saying that's for real that it's they're not going to play the same music every hour and

[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:08.320]
I'm maybe every other hour but not every hour and that's supposed to be like some major breakthrough

[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:13.320]
that's weird because you told us that we know what I hear the same crap over and over again

[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.820]
now we never did find out what hot 105's message we found out what we did when off the year then

[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.900]

show where the host doesn't know is a banana from his earlobe the number is 7779 3600 777 I don't think ever

[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:43.320]
I've been like I said almost 30 years in his business I have never known anybody prettier and more jealous
