[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140]
oh boy i just don't know what this show is degenerating into the i just have no

[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.100]
idea it's all your fault to the disgusting uh... vulgar display at the

[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.200]
table last night there were people uh... swooning and passing out just

[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.820]
watching what

[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.060]
and and like the stranger this total stranger they bring over to the table

[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.120]
fruitcake of all people uh...

[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.860]
and i have no idea what he was doing with her i'm sure not much uh... and bring

[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.140]
and plans her down next to you and right away the bird is like who in her ear

[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.780]
and grabbing her body part and she was liking it that's the thing i couldn't

[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.660]
understand absolutely why new her

[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.460]
i had never met her but i had talked to her before you know her why talk like in

[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.420]
the family way i like in the generic but this was this was i finally met her

[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.800]
in a biblical sense and and something i guess you don't realize about me but

[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.180]
when there are beautiful women around me yeah i

[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.180]
like like river phoenix

[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.940]
phoenix not a woman well

[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.700]
you could change that i guess well anyway that barbie was

[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.020]
here's yet to i just your lawns eight or four

[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.300]
no she was gorgeous and i uh... just uh... was friendly and i'm a friendly guy

[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.260]
isn't that the right word friendly

[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.800]
you pronounce it i think i think leteris

[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.080]
where they're working for

[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.860]
okay i'm a leg

[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.040]
no i'm glad that you brought that up because i was me before i wanted to make a

[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.020]
point and that is

[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.140]
it's always nice to meet people in the audience in the overwhelming majority

[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.420]
of the more nice and they behave

[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.400]
fairly rationally

[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.940]
but there are some of them who come in there like

[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.520]
diving all over people's bodies and did you see that did you see the show

[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.660]
that she put on last night yes i like that she was you like that i enjoyed that

[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.540]
i'm not used to and nobody's diving over my body i'll tell you that now we get

[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.280]
to the real

[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.200]
in other words if i'm going to be in the middle of an orgy i don't want to be

[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.760]
just like sitting there ignored

[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.140]
finally it took an hour right twenty minutes like i mean he got if wiki would have

[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.080]
died across the table and just given me a big hug or a squeeze if you would say

[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.880]
word one right exactly i felt a lot better but i was like the odd man out so to speak

[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.260]
got it and that's not okay that doesn't

[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.000]
and that was like doing swan dives over majors lap and uh... then she had at the

[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.340]
end there she had they've we had a get uh... crane to excavate him from her body

[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.880]
i couldn't believe it that's right and uh... there was some wild stuff going on

[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.540]
there what was that all about uh... i can't answer those questions boy

[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.780]
that was at the other end of the table i had my hands full so to speak at my end of

[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.960]
the table i see what you're saying i would be the same way as you in that situation

[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.660]
the odd man out i kept hearing at aims he was humming it aims my cup run a

[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.900]

think if i told you that's the same little boy who does the top of the hour

[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.820]
id i would say he probably had the operation

[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.140]
and of course the the operative question in the interesting how we work the

[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.800]
operative question it is was the operation before he sounded like this or

[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:42.460]
before he sounded like that that's the question it is the same person yeah it is

[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.860]
the same person at the through harmonizers you know all this incredible

[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.420]
equipment they have over here well why would anybody want to go through a

[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.840]
harmonizer to sound like a 10 year old boy okay camp david can you play the

[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.400]

quality rock and roll 94.9 zeta for where back

[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:06.640]
Neil Rogers the rock and roll monster yeah you're right at the very beginning you can hear

[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.520]
the similarity in his uh absolutely in his lungs yeah it's shocking isn't it is shocking it's just

[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:20.120]
shock radio unbelievable i heard that rumor end credible it is incredible that long ground now for

[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.460]
some reason you they want to just a joke they wanted to keep that a secret from it's just a radio

[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.600]
they didn't want you to know that why is that i have no idea a little frisky yeah is that the word

[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.240]
as in cat food man like to probably think of other by the way kids if mommy and daddy you're

[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.840]
going to be out of the house today and you're staying home from school and that pet kitty is you

[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:46.000]
know bugging you and giving you a hard time i'm not going to say but i'll give you a little hint

[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.500]
stands microwave went out over the weekend it did yeah that's what he said i'd like to get back

[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:56.960]
to this story about the visitor from philadelphia you know the okay so what does that mean was that a

[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.260]
false alarm the captain gave us more bad information well he gets all these mysterious phone calls from

[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.360]
see now you know one cut was real nice you know but i know that that white album they tend to run

[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:16.480]
together a little bit i was listening into lace oh i see that's what he was born as ladies in

[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:24.280]
gentlemen no extra charge bonus on zeta four where you get the entire cut and two or three two or

[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:31.080]
three what i was four seconds on grooves from the next cut it's monday so you see he's nervous

[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.000]
because he gave us all that bad information about the trends and about the book which isn't going

[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.420]
to show anything no where did you get that did you get that from a mr cake i'm going to verify

[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:45.820]
this the source yeah cuz they say noon here well it came over the extension line so i just

[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:51.120]
assumed well what was it like a hollow voice a faceless voice in the middle of night are you

[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:57.280]
turning into howard beel it was a youngish type of voice like a high pitched whiny uh kindle sounding

[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.200]
kept david it sound like it came from kindle yeah that's kind of sounded like that kid who does the

[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:08.660]
ID oh yeah then it was through k and what did he say he may have the number he said what i wrote down

[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.660]
there oh yeah he says he says the trend just came over the computer he says his tell Neil that

[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:20.600]
it's unbelievable and he'll be pleasantly surprised now as you know his his predictions on the numbers

[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.540]
always because he gets him first because the mung brains in this building they can't get the

[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.860]
computer to work you know it's because he's got it all tied up we only pay for it yeah you know

[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.160]
but i think some of us always pay for it well let me let me ask the lady if she please let's

[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.560]
