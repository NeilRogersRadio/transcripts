[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.700]
Hello, this is Michael Jackson.

[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.760]
Urging you to help stop the spread of social disease.

[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.920]
Don't risk your life by having a romantic encounter with an unfamiliar queen.

[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.060]
I urge you to do like I do.

[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.140]
Go it alone.

[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.060]
But make sure you wear protection.

[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.080]
That's why I recommend the Michael Jackson glove.

[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.140]
Worn on either hand, the Michael Jackson glove adds the security in case of mine that

[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.260]
I need to do it myself.

[00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.100]
So remember, before you put it out, put it on and...

[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.620]
Well, Michael Jackson glove, proving once again that a bird in the hand is better than one

[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.680]
in the bush, a Vateland Sequent Model for Extra Stimulation.

[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.460]
Alan Box was a normal man, with a wife, children, a summer home in Opalaca, and a chain

[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.400]
of radio stations.

[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.460]
Well, normal that is until just three weeks ago.

[00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.760]
Hi, honey, how was your day?

[00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.160]
Un...

[00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.800]
Believable.

[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.260]
Terminal!

[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.440]
There's nothing but subhuman douchebags out there.

[00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.660]
Alan Box is suffering from...

[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.020]
Neil Rogers disease.

[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.320]
Have you canceled the Miami Herald yet?

[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.540]
But honey, we don't subscribe to the Herald.

[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.240]
Oh, now that's a cop out.

[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.860]
What kind of a lame excuse is that?

[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.940]
Just say no to L. Herald, sir.

[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.500]
People afflicted with Neil Rogers disease have lost the ability to communicate like normal

[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.320]
human beings.

[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.800]
What's the matter with you?

[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.100]
Blue-haired old bags from Fembroke Pines.

[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.080]
You know the Yen fence, who say, all Neil, how can you say those nasty things?

[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.060]
Running around stealing sweet and low.

[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.200]
Can I get you anything?

[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.360]
How about those bag boys at Windixi?

[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.580]
You know, it doesn't hurt to look.

[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.960]
In...

[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.360]
Credible.

[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.760]
Neil Rogers disease, a growing South Florida epidemic.

[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.540]
Please help us find a cure.

[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.300]
Honey, it's Friday night.

[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.740]
You know what that means.

[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.140]
Hey, you know what I got a nine?

[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.860]
A nine!

[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.320]
What's Lefowler got?

[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.120]
Three points, I think?

[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.920]
Send your tax deductible contributions today in Carav hot 105.

[00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.380]
Terminal.

[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.880]
Un...

[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.420]
Believable.

[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.040]
So Vester Stallone stars in his most challenging role since Rhyne Stone.

[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.500]
Yo, Mandy, and you came, and you came without taking it, and now you're friggin' dead.

[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.300]
Stallone is Manolo.

[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.060]
In Barry, first went part one.

[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.620]
It's a miracle.

[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.300]
Jaja Copa.

[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.440]
Absolutely, yo.

[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.980]
Copa Cabana with my own thing.

[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.900]
Rex Reed says, I love the costumes.

[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.560]
Jean Siskel exclaims, four stars, yo, absolutely.

[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.820]
Roger Ebert says, pass the popcorn.

[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.840]
Sylvester Stallone has the limp arm of the lawn.

[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.120]
Barry, first went part one.

[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.600]
You're the disease.

[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.960]
It I'm the cure.

[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.060]
This death, yo.

[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.820]
And coming this summer.

[00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.320]
I know you are, but what a bond.

[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.760]
Rutger Hauer in.

[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.260]
I know you are, but what a bond.

[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.120]
Peewee's.

[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.380]
Last adventure.

[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.020]
I know you are, but what a-

[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.140]
B-

[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.360]
Hey, young man.

[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.960]
Oh.

[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.260]
Listen, I've seen you hanging around my house, and I-

[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.540]
I saw what I want to talk to you about.

[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.100]
What did you do to me?

[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.100]

[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.100]

[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.100]

[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.100]

[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.100]

[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.980]
I wasn't here now.

[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.020]
I'm going to put it this way.

[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.280]

[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.820]
Wasn't you who did the pushin'?

[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.580]
Put the stains upon the cushion.

[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.460]
Footprints on the dashboard upside down.

[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.600]
Hey, what?

[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.080]
Wasn't you, you broccoli-

[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.140]
Bill, been messing with my daughter, Jill?

[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.960]
If it was, you'd better leave this town.

[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.100]
Well, you got to say.

[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.900]
Yes, to a guy who did the pushin'

[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.960]
Put the stains upon the cushion.

[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.780]
Footprints on the dashboard upside down.

[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.120]
Yeah.

[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.640]
Yeah.

[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.380]
But since a messin' with your daughter,

[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.540]
I've had trouble passing water,

[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.140]
So I guess we're even all around.

[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.880]
Why you?

[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.880]
Come over here.

[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.760]
Come over here.

[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.360]
Come over here.

[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.140]
Come over here.

[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.120]
Come over here.

[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.520]
Stay right.

[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.100]
735 on Zeta 4.

[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.880]
Lots more to come, don't panic,

[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.220]
but you know we have to do these important breaks, right?

[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.440]
Right, Captain Meng?

[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.360]
And let's see, I guess we'll do this last.

[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.480]
We'll be right back.

[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.960]
Look no further.

[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.240]
The best place to get your kicks is that

[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.300]
Kicks lounge in the Cypress Creek Marriott.

[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.400]
Kicks lounge definitely a South Florida landmark.

[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.360]
Come on by for the Kicks Daily Hungry Hour buffet weekdays from 5 till 8.

[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.880]
Feast undelicious or dirt salads,

[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.500]
Cheeses and pasta dishes,

[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.360]
and it's no secret that Kicks doesn't charge you any cover at the door.

[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.160]
Wednesdays it's time to round up the office

[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.540]

[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.800]

[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.660]
Tonight's your night at Kicks Lounge in the Cypress Creek Marriott,

[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.040]
but please don't drink and drive.

[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.440]
What's back to back and never been funnier?

[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.160]
You'll hear it out, Nancy Ray.

[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.580]
No, it's a solid hour of give me a break, followed by Benson at 6.

[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.160]
This is big, this is really big.

Before I go to my room I'd just say one thing.

[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.120]
Family ties in a fun-filled family hour

[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.800]
so catch the new lineup for Week Night Fun.

[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.300]

One, two, three.

[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.380]
They were young and alone together.

[00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.640]

[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.600]
In Pembroke Pines, close to Cooper City and Davey, Captain Mung.

[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.680]
Can I make a comment about DT Riots last night?

[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.100]
Dave McLeod, the owner of DT Riots, invited a number of us from Zeta 4

[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.460]
and wins to come over, sample the place, serve us up some adult beverages and some great food.

[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.260]
And yours truly had a number of adult beverages.

[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.320]
They keep no problems.

[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.120]
No problem.

[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.820]
I can sleep late and of course what happens at 2.30 this morning.

[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.600]
Of course.

[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.480]
But anyway, we had a good time there last night.

[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.480]
We look forward to seeing everybody there Friday.

[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.480]
That's a good, no wonder he looks like who did the owl this morning?

[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.120]
I was trying to figure that out ever since I saw him.

[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.240]
It's a 738 on Zeta 4 now.

[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.700]
Are you saying that, well there's only one of these people still hanging on?

[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.640]
Are they still there? Hello?

[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.880]
Yeah, I'm still here.

[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.240]
Okay, we've been hanging on a long time.

[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.500]
We want to get you on before we start playing all this other junk.

[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.600]
Oh, well I wanted to call and thank you for playing all those things.

[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.680]
It's hard to catch those things when you're jumping in and out of the shower.

[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.100]
Well, you can catch a lot of things on this show.

[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.820]
Yeah, I know.

[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.680]
I've noticed that.

[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:37.300]
But that lady who called, a couple of calls back, could you believe the questions?

[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.080]
I especially haven't worked into places that she's worked for.

[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.720]
She must hang out all by herself.

[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.400]
Oh, I think she has delusions of Oprah.

[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.040]
I think so.

[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.400]
Yeah, what I usually tell girls like that who ask me those questions,

[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.760]
I say not only are you barking up the wrong tree but you're in the wrong forest.

[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.300]
Yeah, like sure would forest.

[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.220]
Well, all right, just wanted a first time caller.

[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:01.520]
Good.

[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.680]
I wanted to call and say hi.

[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.760]
Okay, see you later.

[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.580]
Okay, bye-bye.

[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.100]
Bye-bye.

[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.740]
Okay, I'm glad we got him on.

[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.280]
It was a good caller.

[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.540]
21 to late on ZetaFora.

[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.600]
Keep those tapes rolling, man, because we got some of the greatest stuff in a history of mankind like...

[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.220]
Tired of the same old restaurants?

[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.300]
Try the cafeteria centuria of Hylia.

[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.380]
How much is that doggy on the menu?

[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:36.340]
How much is that doggy on the menu?

[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.040]
I'm sure glad the chef's out of jail.

[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.680]
That's right, no matter what the weather's like outside,

[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.920]
it's always raining cats and dogs at the cafeteria centuria of Hylia.

[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.360]
We'll make your stomach stop.

[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:53.360]

[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.920]
Stop growling and make your neighbors pit bull stop doing the same thing.

[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.140]
Talk about delicious.

[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.280]
Mmm, mmm, your meal is always fresh.

[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.120]
We kill it right on the premises.

[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.240]
For a heavenly meal at a sacrifice price,

[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.520]
it's the cafeteria centuria.

[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:09.520]
Try it once.

[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.380]
You'll eat there religiously.

[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.080]
How much is that doggy on the menu?

[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:22.500]
The one that is fried in deep fat.

[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:29.300]
Please bring me that doggy on the menu.

[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.540]
And bring a side order of cat.

[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:41.480]
Walk, run, or catch a greyhound for the cafeteria centuria of Hylia,

[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.680]
where we give new meaning to the word, het food.

[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:55.820]
Do we run or do we run or swing, Joey, swing?

[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.500]
Burn, baby.

[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.720]
Do we run or show?

[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.520]
What a show.

[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.120]
Do we run or show?

[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.080]
Joey, do we run or show?

[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.860]
What a show.

[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.420]
I'll eat there.

[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.360]
And bring me your cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.

[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.840]
Stevie Nicks, the distinctive voice of Fleetwood Mac.

[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.180]
Her style is unforgettable.

[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.980]
Her lyrics are unintelligible.

[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.880]
Stevie's back with all your favorite hits on one big album.

[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.320]
It's Stevie Nicks.

[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.420]
What the hell is she saying?

[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.540]
Yes, all her classics are here.

[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.480]
You'll get me, me, and the incomparable.

[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.720]
Yes.

[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.580]
Gigitally remumbled for stereo inaudibility.

[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.500]
This is Stevie Nicks, at her most nebulous.

[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.240]
Stevie Nicks, what the hell is she saying?

[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.820]
Available now, I didn't call here her records and takes.

[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.080]
I'm in trouble if I'm riding down the highway.

[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:31.800]
On that throne again, it's the only thing I get to come out my way.

[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.500]
I can't stay.

[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.780]
I gotta go on the throne again.

[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.860]
Yes, I'm sitting on that throne again.

[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:47.480]
Well, it hurts me to the living end.

[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:56.300]
When I'm sitting on that throne again, I gotta go on the throne again.

[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.380]
It's a moving experience.

[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.680]
Yes, I'm sitting on that throne again.

[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.840]
It's day when I wake up.

[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:16.140]
I still have a home I make up and say a lot of praise for you.

[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.680]
Finally, the 10 record set you've been waiting for.

[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.920]
Tammy Faze, unbelievable new album.

[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.480]
Here's the rock I crawled out from under.

[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.420]
I put 16 tons of makeup on.

[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.380]
Then my husband does it with Jessica Hound.

[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.060]
Oh, baby, for cold and go wild.

[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.200]
I'm all strong now down booze and pee.

[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.400]
It's all here, the headache, the heartache, the pancake.

[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:56.580]
Rock of age just is my face.

[00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:01.820]
My mascara only rays.

[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.280]
Tammy Faze, here's the rock that I crawled out from under.

[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.640]
Don't you buy my new album?

[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.200]
If you don't, you're burning hair, you're really way ill.

[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.780]
Thank you, God bless you.

[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:18.440]
When some Swami, He'll try to put me down and says He has a larger congregation.

[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.940]
I tell Him right away, now listen here.

[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:28.180]
The pancake, your heart, I shall discover what in the nation.

[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.980]
All of faith, Himalayan, for so many truths.

[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.460]
I'll show you my life.

[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.940]
Like you would tell your mule.

[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.220]
Be true to your show.

[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.620]
I did hear His call.

[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.340]
Be true to your show.

[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.020]
I've got a new cloth, yamokia, broider than gold.

[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.780]
It sure is bold.

[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.680]
I wear it everywhere when I go round to other A'sy A's.

[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.760]
They don't know what to say.

[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.900]
So be true to your show.

[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.300]
I've got a new cloth, yamokia, broider than gold.

[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.680]
Be true to your show.

[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.160]
I've got a new cloth, yamokia, broider than gold.

[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.820]
Be true to your show.

[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.660]
Our prize, I'll be jacked up on the Sabbath service.

[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.360]
I'll be ready to pray.

[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.320]
I'll be steady now.

[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.120]
My girlfriends at the altar in the choir now.

[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.840]
She'll be singing away.

[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.380]
Be true to your show.

[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.920]
I've got a new cloth, yamokia, broider than gold.

[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.180]

[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.580]
Be true to your show.

[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.880]
I've got a new cloth, yamokia, broider than gold.

[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.960]
Be true to your show.

[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:27.140]

[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:27.140]

[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.200]
I've got a new cloth, yamokia, broider than gold.

[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.440]
Be true to your show.

[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.760]
I've got a new cloth, yamokia, broider than gold.

[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.800]
Be true to your show.

[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.100]
Get me a ticket for an aeroplane.

[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.400]
Got to get on the Wheel of Fortune game.

[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.160]
I just got to win, spin the wheel again.

[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.440]
Ovena, pick me a letter.

[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.660]
Bankrock, what do you mean?

[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.360]
Bankrock, I don't care how much money I got to spend.

[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.220]
Can't stand to look at that say Jack again.

[00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.960]
Won't throw in the towels.

[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.820]
Still like by your vowels.

[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.840]
Ovena, pick me a letter.

[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.280]
Hey man, what do you mean there's no F and F?

[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.180]
Bena, pick me a letter.

[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.880]
No one does it any better.

[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.420]
I dream about you.

[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.440]
Hey, Bena, is that an all over tan or what?

[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.180]
Bena, I don't understand.

[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.160]
Why you make a hundred grand, not for me to say?

[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.960]
Anyway, get me a ticket for an aeroplane.

[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.320]
Gonna be on the Wheel of Fortune game.

[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.860]
I just got to win, spin the wheel again.

[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.240]
Ovena, pick me a letter.

[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.800]
Go, Ovena, go baby, go, alright.

[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.220]
Hey, get out of my face, Pat.

[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.440]
Is that a two-way?

[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.560]
Is there an L in that word?

[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:41.640]
Is it a low rider?

[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.300]
Alright, no rider.

[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.520]
Forget the letter, man.

[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.260]
I'll take Bena, why are you beautiful baby?

[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.760]
You're an eco-plate of home games.

[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.000]
Got me a ticket for an aeroplane.

[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.640]
Alright, I'm on the Wheel of Fortune game.

[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.700]
I just love that sound.

[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.260]
I'm in the bonus round.

[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.540]
Hey, Bena, pick me a letter.

[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:01.740]
Loser turn.

[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.200]
Hey, Pat, lose this.

[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.980]
Bena, pick me a letter.

[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.640]
No one does it any better.

[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.180]
I dream about you.

[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.240]
Alright, that is an all over tan.

[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.000]
Bena, I don't mean to stare,

[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.500]
but are you wearing underwear?

[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.900]
Not for me to say.

[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.500]
Anyway, I don't care how much money I got to spend.

[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.400]
Can't stand to look at Pat's age.

[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.020]
Jack again won't throw in the towel.

[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.920]
Till I buy your vowels.

[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.980]
Oh, Bena, pick me a letter.

[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.320]
Please Bena, pick me a letter.

[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.080]
Alright, I'm ready to pick, baby.

[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:38.880]
ABCDFGHHKLMOPQITWXYZ.

[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.300]
That's your cover, man.

[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.000]
Alright, I'll take the sofa, the blender, the microwave,

[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:44.780]
the refrigerator.

[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.360]
Hey, man, Pat, what do you mean $500 for a black and white five

[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.540]
in portable TV set?

[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.020]
You got ripped off, man.

[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.300]
My brother and I'll forget it for your whole sale.

[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.860]
Give me the money and I'll buy the TV set, man.

[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.200]
Alright?

[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.500]
750 out of Zeta 4.

[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.280]
You know, it's amazing.

[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.020]
Captain Dave is out of the weather.

[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.180]
We wish him a speedy recovery.

[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.040]
However, he is not so sick

[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.320]
that he doesn't want to muscle in on the act,

[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.520]
because there's a message down the screen.

[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.200]
Captain Dave called again to suggest that we play

[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.160]
some of his IDs as bits.

[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:14.800]
Isn't that cute?

[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:15.960]
Yeah.

[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.240]
In fact, maybe we can even play that thing he did for you know who

[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:19.900]
on an AM.

[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.740]
Oh, he's just loved the fact that he's doing stuff for the AM now.

[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.140]
Oh, you're not.

[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.600]
Well, when you listen back to this tape, you will know that

[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:33.100]
the big story in the news February 24, 1988 is Jimmy Swaggerd.

[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.300]
And a motel resident said she regularly saw him

[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.820]
visit the CD section of town in Baton Rouge.

[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.060]
It's an area of town known for the...

[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:43.660]
90 hours.

[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.580]
Don't loosen, I know.

[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:49.600]
Shocking, but it's a section of town known for the by the hour motels.

[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.320]
You know, in prostitutes.

[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.960]
Peggy Carrier, 39, a resident of Tony's Motel.

[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:59.620]
So the New Orleans Times that detectives hired by rival evangelist Marvin Gorman

[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.680]
questioned her about Swaggerd's activities.

[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.960]
Now I know what that show is that he had that syndication of the hour of power.

[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.260]
She told the detectives she had seen him on several occasions

[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:14.460]
visiting the nearby Texas Motel and the travel in where he would park his luxury car

[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.540]
in the rear.

[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.480]
I bet he did.

[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.980]
Not that many American athletes have struck goal in Calgary, but ABC,

[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.220]
ABC, yes, did it like Dick Capenday there.

[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.940]
But ABC is a reason for that Swaggerd story.

[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.220]
Our chase is just shocking.

[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:33.540]
Anyway, it's coverage of the Winter Olympics have done real well in the weekend in February

[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:34.720]
21st.

[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:39.280]
Cap your four places in the top 10 and ABC is the number one network overall.

[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:40.620]
NBC is number two.

[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.860]
Number one show for the week ABC's Thursday Olympics, followed by the Cosby Show.

[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:53.160]
ABC's Saturday Olympics was third, followed by a different world with Lisa Bonay and 60 minutes.

[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.520]
Mostly cloudy today with a 40% hands-or-ain, oh we have an accident or roll over.

[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.240]
I 95 Southbound near 60 second Avenue.

[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:00.980]
Is it like a turnover?

[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.420]
Yeah, and Alibar is back, so we welcome him back.

[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:05.320]
We're glad about that.

[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.720]
Now we can get Captain Dave back.

[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.440]
That's not good.

[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.340]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.520]
Mostly cloudy, 40% chance of showers with a high of 77 today,

[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.520]
low to night 64.

[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:20.240]
The fog is burning off and it's 70 degrees now at Zeta 4, at 752.

[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.540]
The Neil Roger Schill on Zeta 4.

[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.560]
755 on Zeta 4 here on A.

[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.240]
Wednesday more if you're in, if you're dumb and you're wondering what's going on here,

[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.240]
I mean, they have to be a genius to figure it out.

[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:37.340]
We're playing all these bits, not all of them, but just enormous numbers of them between 9 o'clock

[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.100]
for all he painted and he asked people out there that keep sending in cassette.

[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:44.840]
When you please tape this and when you please dub that, we don't have time to screw around with that, okay?

[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.200]
Right.

[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.300]
So we're giving you a chance of a lifetime and if you got your cassette rolling, in fact you can start it now.

[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.640]
Even if you're that stupid or maybe you just got up, that's a good excuse.

[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:58.560]
You can stick your cassette on now, just put it on record and let it roll for the next hour and a couple of minutes

[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.480]
and you'll have all kinds of great stuff, right?

[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.440]
Great idea.

[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:01.780]
Right.

[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:08.180]
I've got sunshine on W-I-N-Z.

[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:17.940]
When there's a hurricane blowing baby, it's still the month of May.

[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:32.760]
From 2 to 6, I guess you say what can make me feel that way, stand there, you hear.

[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.380]
Talking about stand-rager, stand-merger.

[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:47.320]
I've got so much on it, there's a bee in the evening.

[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:55.540]
He checks the mobile colors while he's smoking on a stokey.

[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:08.720]
I guess you say 2 to 6 W-I-N-Z stand-merger.

[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.680]
Talking about stand-merger, stand-merger.

[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.820]
You're ready to hit.

[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.680]
Hey, hey, hey.

[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:39.000]
Hey, hey, hey.

[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.080]
Woo, yeah.

[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:49.620]
I don't need no station on my radio.

[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:59.400]
I've got non-fotty locked in baby, with stand-major on my radio.

[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.280]
All together now, everybody.

[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:13.560]
I guess you say 2 to 6 W-I-N-Z stand-merger.

[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:20.440]
Talking about stand-merger, stand-merger.

[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.560]
What's the major in baby?

[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:29.240]
Oh, stand-merger, smokey as a god baby.

[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.020]
Check that phone of color stands.

[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.100]
Hey, Neil.

[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:33.460]
Yeah.

[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.620]
I hope you beat me in the ratings.

[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:35.480]
You better than I am.

[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:40.640]
Even the competition agrees, the Neil Rogers show on WZTA Miami Beach

[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.880]
Fort Lauderdale and the Palm Beach is the best morning show in South Florida.

[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.560]
I think I would get to 9th here on an A-M station as a hero in my book.

[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.900]
You're like, say time is the quietest.

[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:50.940]
You got no problem with me.

[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:55.540]
Even the other morning shows listen to the Neil Rogers show on SATA 4.

[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:56.740]
I hope you beat me in the ratings.

[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:57.600]
You better than I am.

[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.800]
Well, I know you must feel the same way after all these years has been entertaining.

[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:06.060]
Well, sometimes, when you have a problem, it helps to talk with others who have the same problem.

[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.000]
Okay, elbows, you guys are under the chair with a group now.

[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.060]
Yes, I do.

[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.100]
Thank you very much, sir.

[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:10.820]
Thank you very much, sir.

[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.660]
You should hold on, elbows.

[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.880]
You should be ordering some double cheese pizzas first.

[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.340]
You should get some peanut butter and anise.

[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.360]
That's a good idea, elbows.

[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.140]
Well, thank you, elbows.

[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.920]
You're listening to an encounter session at your local Eleonnance.

[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.460]
Eleonnance, where chronic elbows impersonators go for elbows.

[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.160]
Now, once again, what was that you saying, Elvena?

[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.620]
Well, sir, I think it's time that people step, discriminate against us, female impersonators,

[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.580]
and if they don't, you know, I got so I've earned two.

[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:34.900]
Thank you very much.

[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:35.500]
Thank you very much.

[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.080]
Learn to recognize the early warning sign.

[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.000]
Twitching lips.

[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.140]
I can't control my flames.

[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.960]
Swinging hips.

[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.140]
I'm an awful shukka.

[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.380]
Incredible weight gain.

[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.180]
More Twinkies, please.

[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.900]
At Elvis Enonymous, we understand that in person,

[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.920]
fascinating Elvis is not a career.

[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.640]
It's a disease.

[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.320]
Love it tender.

[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.200]
Love it sweet.

[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.740]
Give us something to eat.

[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.160]
So please, send what you can to L&R.

[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.180]
Members Tennessee.

[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:07.460]
And thank you.

[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.360]
Thank you, sir.

[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.100]
Thank you very much.

[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.040]
Thank you very much.

[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:11.320]
Thank you very much.

[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.260]
It's up on me.

[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.020]
Oh shukka, boy.

[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.860]
I caught my career.

[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.340]
It was true.

[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.640]
But then right out of the blue,

[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.860]
my new album's no better to

[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.160]
I guess my career is true.

[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.140]
I'm making more money.

[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.180]
Much more than ring of honey.

[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.520]
Even more than John Lennon's sunny.

[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.980]
But not more than Paul.

[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.760]
No, I'm singing this song.

[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.340]
It goes on much too long.

[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.620]
It's such a repetitive song.

[00:26:53.440 --> 00:27:00.080]
You see what, you see what, you see what, you see what, you see what I mean.

[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.500]
I thought my career was true.

[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.220]
I checked it with my career.

[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.840]
He said to sing this, so do.

[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.220]
So now my career is true.

[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.880]
I had some career role.

[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.040]
But I don't have ringos' nose.

[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.060]
I guess I can't complain.

[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.600]
My song will drive you insane.

[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.160]
You wish my career was true.

[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.380]
Your wish in this song was true.

[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.800]
It's nothing but don't poop, poop, poop.

[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.780]
I have a real low IQ.

[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.080]
Low IQ.

[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.560]
Don't be dead.

[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.140]
Career is true.

[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.840]
More proof.

[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:57.900]
My girl.

[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.460]
Hey, hey, what do you say?

[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.700]
There's something new at McDougals today.

[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.460]
Hi, I'm Bob from McDougals.

[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.120]
And if we got a surprise for you,

[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.280]
a brand new item you're gonna like.

[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.320]
Whenever you come here on a bike,

[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.220]
for every bike rider with every purchase of a triple cheese sandwich,

[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.080]
a free pair of McHancoffs.

[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.000]
They're pink and green and yellow too.

[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.340]
In every size, a pair for you.

[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.700]
So come in here on two wheels, you'll be leaving on four.

[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.700]
Why you're at McDougals register for free bail and remember our motto?

[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.200]
Our burgers are fresh, we never bread them.

[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.660]
Now hands on your head, turn around and spread them.

[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.120]
At McDougals.

[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.100]
Yeah.

[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.220]
You feel the pressure start to grow in.

[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.920]
You feel the pressure getting worse.

[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.420]
You feel your bladder overflowing.

[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.520]
You feel a damn about the bust.

[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.460]
I don't go in here so well.

[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.260]
Just take off down the hall.

[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:11.020]
There's a bathroom on the right.

[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.960]
Don't go on the floor.

[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.900]
Just move on down to doors.

[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.620]
There's a bathroom on the right.

[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.200]
You train a fifth of chiefs to Keela.

[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.160]
You change the town with shops to gin.

[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.820]
You feel your head begin to reeling.

[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.720]
You see the room begin to spin.

[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.800]
I don't buy from my shoes.

[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.620]
If lunch you're gonna lose.

[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.320]
There's a bathroom on the right.

[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.540]
Don't go up on us.

[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.540]
Don't go down the floor.

[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.960]
There's a bathroom on the right.

[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.220]
There's a bathroom on the right.

[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.940]
Language tape number six.

[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.180]
The convenience store.

[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.840]
Follow along and repeat.

[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.600]
Convenience store manager.

[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:23.700]
Hello.

[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.280]
May I be to help you please?

[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:30.580]
Yes.

[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.660]
I would like a pack of Parliament lights.

[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.400]
Convenience store manager.

[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.260]
You want a Parliament light?

[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.220]
Repeat.

[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.820]
You want a Parliament light?

[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:42.800]
Customer.

[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:43.720]
Yes.

[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.120]
I would like a pack of Parliament lights.

[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.840]
Convenience store manager.

[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:51.880]
Disappearment light.

[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.000]
Repeat.

[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.400]
Disappearment light.

[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.460]
This one.

[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:56.820]
Customer.

[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:57.640]
No.

[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.300]
Neither one of those is the Parliament light.

[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.080]
Right.

[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:02.580]
No.

[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.520]
Is this one?

[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:03.960]
No.

[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:04.580]
No.

[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:05.500]
It's not that one.

[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.380]
You want a Parliament light?

[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:06.620]
Yes.

[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.700]
I want the Parliament lights please.

[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.320]
Is it that one?

[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:09.940]
No.

[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.480]
Can't you see it's a...

[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:14.820]
This one.

[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:15.360]

[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.880]
Over there by the dirty magazine.

[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:17.740]
Can't you see it?

[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:18.900]
Listen, laundry head.

[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.060]
It's a Parliament light.

[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:20.480]
Now.

[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.380]
Turn this tape over for language tape number six.

[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:24.700]
Seven.

[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.520]
Ordering Chinese food over the phone.

[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.000]
Sounds good to me.

[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.500]
It's 805 on Zeta4 as we continue with the greatest hits of your life, right?

[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:34.960]
Is that what this is?

[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:35.180]

[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:36.720]
Funny.

[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.100]
It seems like there's an echo in here.

[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.400]
Crosynchronicity there.

[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.220]
On the Glen Hill show.

[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.040]
Anyway, there we are.

[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:42.880]
It's a wonderful Wednesday.

[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.560]
The fog is just slowly but surely lifting out there.

[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.460]
Let's do a little weather.

[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:47.140]
Okay.

[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.460]
And then we'll just continue with all of this stuff.

[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:49.960]
This is great.

[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:50.940]
I could do this every day.

[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:51.600]
Isn't this fun?

[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.580]
This brings back memories.

[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:57.460]
And even more fun is finding out which of these are so loose on the cards.

[00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.360]
That's my favorite.

[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.100]
No matter what you do, there's dead air.

[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:00.560]
I like that.

[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.440]
Well, you know I enjoy that dead air.

[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.380]
Mostly cloudy with a 40% chance of showers.

[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.300]
Like a bathroom on the right, that was loose.

[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:08.840]
Yeah.

[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.520]
Nice to play that though.

[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.560]
That's one of my own time favorites.

[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.460]
High to day 77, low to night 64.

[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:20.320]
I was just over at the AM and I checked it out and it's still 70 degrees this morning in the town of Florida.

[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.940]
In New Orleans they have Mardi Gras.

[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.120]
In Brazil they have Carnival.

[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.880]
But Miami, parties, faster.

[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.220]
The grand prix of Miami.

[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.040]
Thousands of people will party in the sleeves as 28 world champion drivers.

[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.600]
Confundering down the Stain Boulevard at 200 miles an hour.

[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:50.060]
It's everything news week magazine called America's Casa Blanca.

[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:57.500]
Exciting, exotic, sensuous, a little on the wild side.

[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:02.380]
February 28th, the grand prix of Miami.

[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:11.180]
This just in, grand prix ticket sales are 30% ahead of last year's sellout.

[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:17.820]
We've added grandstands, hurry, tickets at Bass Outlets, Barons, Rosaro,

[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.200]
or Call 665.

[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:21.460]
Race!

[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:27.060]
Cheers brings you fun TV on 33, weeknights at 730.

[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.420]
Say what am I moving for?

[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.840]
I'm at a good meeting.

[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.520]
Tonight Sam returns to his Playboy ways.

[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:34.440]
Uh oh.

[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:41.200]
The genetic date on Florida's Super Station WBFS TV, 33's Prime Movie, is My Tutor.

[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:45.420]
Karen Kay is going to teach Matt Latanzi more than the French language.

[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.760]
Now I'm going to teach you a skills that all young men should know.

[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.620]
She's the kind of teacher that'll make guys want to stay after school.

[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.420]
But you're born at a date on TV 33.

[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.920]
Phoebe Kates is off to private school.

[00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.980]
Do you think I'm doing the right thing with Jim?

[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.540]
I mean, I guess I'm kind of scared.

[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.800]
She's going to learn all about the three bees.

[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.700]
Boys, boys, and boys.

[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.380]
We did it at 730.

[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:10.160]
Cheers!

[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.380]
To make a date, My Tutor.

[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:16.020]
Tomorrow to date, private school, all on TV 33.

[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.260]
Florida Super Station!

[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.080]
WBFS TV, 33.

[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:25.300]
He's the first kid on the block, first kid,

[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.500]
and he gets up right and early.

[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.260]
Right and early.

[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.300]
Well, you know he's a little nutty.

[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.180]
Got him the nutty.

[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:33.160]
And you know he's a little squirrely.

[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:33.980]
Got him squirrely.

[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.740]
Well, he peaks at you through the hole in the record.

[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.380]
Just to say hello.

[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.820]
Hi, I can see what you're all doing out there.

[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.200]
Yeah, in the morning, I'm Zeta 4 radio.

[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.620]
It's the Neil Rogers show.

[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.220]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.380]
The Bob Spokes Dove.

[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.380]
Guy taking the grass.

[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.400]
The Bob Spokes Dove.

[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.180]
He likes to smoke in my seat.

[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.480]
At Puebloot Hacker, we make computers.

[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.600]
But we're always asking, what if?

[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:07.500]
What if bananas had the peel on the inside?

[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.920]
What if Mother Teresa married as a Osborne?

[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.940]
Would she bite the heads off Doves?

[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.620]
What if Don Johnson could act?

[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.060]
What if the President was a hamster?

[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.100]
What if toilet paper were never invented?

[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.420]
Would people still shake hands?

[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.560]
Puebloot Hacker.

[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.000]
Asking irrational questions,

[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.180]
but have nothing to do with computers.

[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.940]
Got myself in a pinch,

[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:36.340]
going back to the bench.

[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.600]
My boy, Ginsburg.

[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.200]
Got caught up by some pot.

[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:46.800]
Not a lot.

[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.960]
Chances shot.

[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.480]
Oh, Ginsburg.

[00:35:54.940 --> 00:36:00.760]
No one at my age could help avoid it.

[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:07.220]
Sad we can't admit that we enjoyed it.

[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.840]
On the card I'd reign supreme,

[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:16.100]
Up in smoke goes my dream.

[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.440]
Ginsburg.

[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.760]
My boy.

[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.580]
Here's my story.

[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:29.900]
It's strange but true.

[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:34.980]
I'm about to mature that I once knew.

[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:41.580]
He took Kistushka and ran around.

[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:47.040]
Do every single, stable in town.

[00:36:50.300 --> 00:37:17.020]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:47.000]
Or you can get it. Yeah. I mean, with a skirt inaiso

[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.880]
I wonder how we get to the ground, yeah

[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.400]
This is a piece they never touched the ground

[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.740]
Now people listen what I say

[00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:59.260]
Forgive him to talk every day

[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:02.020]
Here's the moment of the story from a guy who knows

[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:05.220]
Try to give him something before he goes

[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.380]
He might be Alia who wanna be from a foe

[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:11.600]
Or maybe that's my show of his up-minded foe

[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.440]
Yeah give him something now

[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:20.800]
No matter what you do, he's a holy Jew

[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.860]
I wonder how we get to the ground, yeah

[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.220]
This is a piece they never touched the ground

[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.820]
Now people listen what I say

[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.060]
Forgive him to talk every day

[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.860]
Here's the moment of the story from a guy who knows

[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.780]
Try to give him something before he goes

[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:44.140]
He might be Alia who wanna be from a foe

[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:47.440]
Or maybe that's my show of his up-minded foe

[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.280]
Yeah give him something now

[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:57.060]
No matter what you do, he's a holy Jew

[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.560]
Come on everybody

[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.280]
It's gifts, a piece they never touched the ground

[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.960]
You know that's the right thing to do

[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.220]
Come on everybody

[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.180]
It's a life I am not a Nazi

[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.060]
Just when you thought crap-cold records

[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.960]
Couldn't possibly be more tasteless

[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:26.080]
An aval apel-aven, an atreane bound for Brooklyn

[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.700]
I met this year accountant

[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.220]
He ever bought you a tadee-smooth

[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.220]
That's right, so...

[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.280]
It's the cat-skilled cowboy himself

[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.980]
Dr. Erbing Paycheck

[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.660]
Signing the all-time greatest hits of Noschwil

[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.460]
You'll hear the accountant

[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.580]
You gotta know how to feed him

[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.080]
Know how to cheat him

[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.600]
If you wanna live your good life

[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.580]
Deeper seconds said I've booked

[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.220]
And who could forget this flavorful cut?

[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.480]
Looking for locks in all their own places

[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:01.180]
Looking for locks I'd buy by the cases

[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:02.860]
Quality stuff

[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.040]
Be sure there's no cases of bones

[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.780]
Or to my soul

[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:12.020]
And no collection of old country music would be complete

[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:15.840]
Without Dr. Erbing Paycheck's dietary classic

[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.300]
I've his co-shed

[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.540]
B'em co-shed

[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.540]
Bosn'couilless

[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.520]
Crap-cold records proudly presents

[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.500]
The all-time greatest hits of Noschwil

[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.120]
No, it's not my amymul

[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:31.740]
To order Noschwil hits, dial 1-800-6-Bah

[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:34.140]
Dr. Erbing Paycheck, cos he's...

[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.640]
God does not my amymul

[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.700]
Yeah, wait

[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.920]
It's a good time for the great taste

[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:44.260]
Sound good, that?

[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.240]
My name is Igorov

[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.700]
And I'd like you to know

[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.420]
Everywhere I go

[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:07.760]
I hear Neil Roger show

[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.240]
Young men are nice to me

[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.720]
They bear their chest to me

[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.980]
There's just one problem

[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:17.760]
They don't show the rest to me

[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.120]
I am very happy

[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.480]
Living in this factory

[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.860]
And it'll be cause

[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:28.020]
Of the Neil Roger show

[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.440]
It's the Neil Roger show

[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:41.340]
Oh, the Neil Roger show

[00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.020]
Way down the dumb my amymul

[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:03.520]
Down where the dope comes in

[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:07.100]
That's where we own our shipments

[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.100]
We believe we're aliens

[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.640]
And we don't have to worry

[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.900]
We won't get reaped off

[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:20.500]
The police will help us start it

[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.560]
As long as they're paid off

[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.220]
The police will be dark, she's slippery

[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.980]
My name is Barry

[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:47.100]
Sing like a fairy

[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:50.060]
I write bad songs about romance

[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.140]
While I'm wearing spandex pants

[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.720]
I'm trying to shrimp it

[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.840]
My soul is like a fairy

[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:54.840]

[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:58.740]
I had a series of big hits

[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:00.680]
That was back in 76

[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.680]
Now no one wants to hear

[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.960]
They only laugh and steer

[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.520]
They won't admit that they own my albums

[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.460]
Because my songs are queer

[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:11.120]
Got a nose shake

[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.940]
Like a banana

[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:17.240]
My two fans both live in Montana

[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.620]
Got a nose shake

[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.160]
Like a banana

[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:28.640]
Up my nose you can fit half of the city of Atlanta

[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.440]
I write the songs

[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.680]
Like a banana

[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:41.160]
I've got a hugger

[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.160]
The size of the youngest

[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.000]
When I get a stuffed up nose

[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.940]
I be twisted in a hose

[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.960]
But now I'm on the case

[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.140]
My life is back in place

[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.640]
And so I'm singing again and sticking

[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.780]
My snaz in your face

[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.260]
Got a nose shake

[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.080]
Like a banana

[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:04.660]
My two fans both live in Montana

[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.940]
Got a nose shake

[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:09.540]
Like a banana

[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:15.600]
Up my nose you can fit half of the city of Atlanta

[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:21.840]
I write the songs

[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.800]
Like a banana

[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.600]
Like a banana

[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.400]
Like a banana

[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:43.380]
I sell for virgin albums

[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.940]
I'm pushing me close

[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:49.200]
My music's up for sale too

[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.900]
And he won around the globe

[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:55.100]
It's on TV, it's on radio

[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.720]
My songs are in the movies

[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.560]
Yes, I'm sold out baby

[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.920]
I'm raking in the door

[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:06.160]
I look like grandpa monster

[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.220]
I'm barely three feet tall

[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:12.180]
And another two weeks

[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:15.260]
I have no hair at all

[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:18.380]
Still I've been on Miami vise

[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.480]
Too bad I'm not an actor

[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.700]
They're dumb enough to pay me

[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.840]
I'm raking in the door

[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:33.900]
I'm selling out night today

[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.140]
I'm selling out nights today

[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.400]
I'm selling out night today

[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:53.280]
I'm selling out nights today

[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:53.720]
I'm selling out nights today

[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:53.800]
I'm selling out nights today

[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.900]
836 on Zeta 4

[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.340]
This could be kind of a regular feature

[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:59.160]
Maybe once every day or something like that

[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.440]
For a couple of hours

[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.420]
Okay, now listen, you want to

[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:21.260]
Remember when nobody knew my name

[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:25.380]
But now I can no big star

[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.540]
Times of fame

[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:35.980]
I can make a hearth song in a building

[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:39.180]
Taking no chances

[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:46.940]
All I do is scream like I'm in shock

[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:54.960]
Don't my songs all sound the same

[00:46:56.660 --> 00:47:01.260]
I can't believe that keep on selling

[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:08.480]
My agent told me not to change

[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.840]
Nothing

[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:16.300]
So I guess I'll keep on yelling

[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:23.340]
Don't my songs all sound the same

[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:33.460]
The feelings I just left the past once

[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:37.640]
I say so high and make the doors

[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.920]
God knows

[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:47.620]
God, my sons are the same

[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:58.700]
Yes, my sons are the same

[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.620]
He's big

[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.980]
He's bad and he wants you

[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:08.820]
Say I am some botan

[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:11.020]
He's a street wise cop by night

[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.640]
Say you are under arrest

[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.040]
And a presidential candidate by day

[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:15.920]
Don't be no two

[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.660]
Get it at home with food

[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:21.420]
Car on weather is action Jesse Jackson

[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:24.900]
Either I'm ramen on the stump or I'm buffed in up some tomb

[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:27.140]
Also starring Don Nots' George Bush

[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:29.760]
And Oprah Winfrey as the state of New Hampshire

[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.680]
It's the presidency that I seek

[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.900]
But I also want to put out Jim of the green

[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:37.920]
Action Jesse Jackson coming soon to a primary near you

[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:39.180]
Bye

[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.260]
Will we took our debt?

[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:48.620]
He's pulled out and we headed for the Hollywood freeway

[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:54.760]
But we hit a lot of traffic and got stuck in a two-hour delay

[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:02.640]
So we pulled out our pistols and we dealt with the traffic in a new way

[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:07.360]
We used our guns guns guns when we're driving down the streets of LA

[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:11.000]
We're driving down the streets of LA

[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:19.920]
When I drive around I go out to people dead

[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:27.640]
I come back late at night with my friends all splattered red

[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:31.600]
We'll hand this like in the most

[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:35.000]
And when I'm out driving around the coast

[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:40.280]
I want to shoot a Honda blast to bat off of the road

[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:46.360]
With my hand gun shoot shoot a Honda

[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.800]
Shoot a Honda shoot shoot a Honda

[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.900]
Shoot a Honda yet blast it off of the road

[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:03.520]
If everybody had a man, all across LA

[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:10.660]
It all be pulling their guns up on the old freeway

[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:13.640]
It'd be firing at the U.S.

[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:16.460]
For some chance the Lays

[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:22.320]
Everybody's going crazy driving in LA

[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.100]
The Lays are going crazy driving in LA

[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:40.580]
It's going crazy driving in LA

[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:40.580]

[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:41.060]
It's going crazy driving in LA

[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.400]
Coming up in cheesecake

[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.820]
It's making the music

[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:53.080]
All of the old folks are with them all

[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:00.000]
The check in the CDs

[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.540]
No they never say please

[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:10.960]
Just waiting for the early birds special to come

[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:18.680]
And wasting waiting and good old Honda

[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:27.220]
Searching for the false teeth they left in a glass

[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:37.380]
And how near they claim that there's a talk host to play

[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:43.540]
But they know it's their own damn fault

[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.480]
They're shooting in LA

[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:01.220]
To get the early bird on time

[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:06.320]
They're pushing just as hard as they can

[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:12.780]
And once they are seated

[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:17.240]
They get overheated

[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:23.920]
And stock stuff in rows and sweeten low in their bags

[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:31.640]
Wasting away again and good old Honda

[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:39.620]
Looking for that long lost power of you

[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:48.820]
And how near they say that it's all of the truth

[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:51.940]
A day but for some

[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:56.340]
And then I'm mind the blues

[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:02.620]
The old folks don't know the reason

[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:07.040]
Why nothing is pleasing

[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:13.060]
But muscles ache and the teeth just don't fit

[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:19.240]
But what doesn't matter

[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.820]
When they call up kneeling chatter

[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:31.420]
I hate you kneeling never listen to your show

[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:38.280]
But wasting away again and good old Honda

[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:46.100]
Just the box of metal musul and a radio

[00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:56.540]
And how near they claim that it's a talk host to play

[00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:58.680]
But kneel nose

[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:02.620]
They can't wait for his show

[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:12.640]
And how they'll claim that it's a talk host to play

[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:15.180]
But kneel nose

[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:21.420]
They just can't wait for his show

[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.300]
Don't you love a little chirp on there on the phone

[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:33.740]
Okay 9 o'clock right on the nose

[00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:36.960]
Here on WZTA Miami Beach Fort Lauderdale in the Palm Beach

[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:37.920]
And that concludes

[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:59.360]
So bad you have been such a naughty boy

[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:04.760]
Sell some land hide 100 grand where they want to know

[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:09.080]
Drop by the dew flex for the new suit and sport hot show

[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:13.040]
From helic copter men on ground look like cockroach

[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:18.880]
Smoke big cigar drive fancy cars on Kaye Jojo

[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:22.160]
Adios sirs you in your terror

[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:26.540]

[00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:30.920]
Sure all by itself. I think should I do it by itself? And you want to do something with it here? Let me take a look

[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:36.120]
You can do something with it. Okay mostly cloudy today 40% chance of showers high

[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:39.280]
77 low 64 tonight and

[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:48.760]
And at last check as we last spoke to Dave writer on his magic weather bus, but we'll get an update here. Yeah

[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.480]
Seven nine

[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.400]
Where's the money Dave?

[00:59:54.640 --> 01:00:01.080]
You are pretty close 72 now. I hadn't given a temperature. Yeah, 70 I didn't give one you

[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:04.800]
That's what you were gonna say, I bet you know it is as a man kind of felt that

[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:12.380]
Anyway, if you're looking for the very best and I do mean the best mouthwatering seafood and shellfish anywhere in Miami and Fort Lauderdale

[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:13.820]
Lauderdale

[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:17.240]
Then you really got ahead for shells because shells isn't a class by itself

[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.820]
And not always the food delicious, but the price is so reasonable

[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:23.980]
You can come back time and time again to give it these humongous bowls overflowing

[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:29.080]
I mean like falling on the floor in your lap with delicious shrimp and all kinds of great other seafood and

[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:33.160]
The shrimp's camping by the way so good that it's triple X rated in Fort Lauderdale

[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:37.960]
Mm-hmm and the prices are so reasonable that you can't even cook yourself at home for that kind of price

[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:43.100]
That's how great it is and don't forget tomorrow night now what's gonna happen captain Dave was supposed to be there with us

[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:49.440]
With a date. Yeah, that's right big Dave and I are gonna be there and also Bob and Harlan from Cooper City

[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:52.540]
Hi, I'll be this maybe they'll have to sit in for captain Dave and his date boy

[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:56.160]

[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.080]
But from six to eight tomorrow night at the new shells, which is just open recently

[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:06.340]
And that's on Oakland Park Boulevard just over near federal highway near US one a quarter mile west to be exact of US

[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:11.960]
One and again will be there filling our faces from six to eight tomorrow night and the big Dave will be a more than happy to

[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.780]
You know show you a picture of his Ferrari

[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:16.480]
Mm-hmm, and well, I'll be just having a marvelous time

[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:22.540]
But you're gonna want to be there for sure and to taste some of that delicious seafood because shells is a seafood experience at prices

[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:28.140]
That you cannot afford to miss as they say all right, so we'll look for it tomorrow night from six to eight at the new

[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:30.680]
Shows and of course don't forget there are two other shells locations in

Stay out those steroids, but I'll tell you they'll kill you

[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:09.780]
So Neil do you know that one of the side effects of steroids? I'm not making this up either is um

How do I say this? Yeah, no, you don't know what it is well. I have an idea. It's continual erections that won't go away

[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:31.820]
Hey, forgot one bit. You know, I listened to the major show. I called you the other day. You forgot the screen didn't you?

[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.480]
To put the screen on and oh the screen is in the other room

[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.480]

You know, let's see days in stand show. I got a hand there. That's my fix

[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:14.640]
Well, you can get to the point now where

[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.940]
Where I can't take it anymore. By the way, here's an interesting tidbit for you. It says on a screen

[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.320]
This is a credit. You're not gonna believe this

[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:26.880]
River Phoenix is on the cover of the January issue of vegetarian times

[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:34.480]
I wonder what they're trying to say that's funny. That's incredible somehow it's appropriate

[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:39.140]
No wonder he looks so pasty and pale, you know, I got this picture that somebody said he really looks tragic

[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:47.740]
No, no, the bird was, you know, getting everybody all excited about River Phoenix. Now we see he's growtessk

[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.380]
He has gruesome

[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:57.480]
Brian now he does not look like Brian. Oh, no, unfortunately, right

[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:00.940]
Yeah, one other thing I went out with the girl from Dave Ryder show

[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:07.080]
Did and what I would have last night, I thought maybe you could call and let me find out how to shoot what she thought of the date

Okay, okay, we'll call her right now. Okay, thanks right boy boy forgot about 915 on Zeta 4. Well, it's so easy to forget

[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:15.960]

[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:20.480]
Got playing those bits and I mean

[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:25.820]
Why does the phone sound so funny day? You know, so that sounds like it's got a hiss in it

[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:27.920]
Hi

[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.880]
I have to tell you about this first it was with his guy named George

[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:42.360]
He was into horseback riding and when I told him that I was too he invited me to go to his grandfather stable to go riding with him

[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:48.360]
Well, first let me tell you George was the best looking guy I have ever gone out with. I mean, I'm talking

[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.200]
Bill, he's really built

[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:55.380]
He had thick blonde hair and the prettiest eyes. I mean like baby

[01:08:55.380 --> 01:09:02.740]
He could be through eyes and he was about five foot eight and well as soon as we got on the horses we went riding into the forest

[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.980]
It was so romantic and it was like out of a movie

[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:08.360]
And we were surrounded by all these trees

[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:12.860]
And told me how much he liked me and couldn't wait till we got back to the stable

[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:17.400]
Because well we went on a hay ride that night and I'll never forget it

[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:19.760]
George and I are going riding next weekend too

[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:23.500]
Come back tomorrow and I'll tell you all about another date I had

[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:28.240]
Now we didn't even get to a kiss today. I don't believe she's going back out with them

[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:31.580]
I don't buy it. She may be going for a tumble in the hay, but it'll be by herself

[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:35.520]
I think he was interested in getting back to the stables and a hurry for a different reason

[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:38.660]
The animal lovers to get up said if I said what it was

[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:45.740]
917 on zeta 4 and let's take a cool cool from brownered hello. Hey, how you doing great at a spy report for you

[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:52.400]
Okay, let's hear it. Lay it out. You'll play in the bits. I tuned over to the glove. Yes, and they had this elderly psychic on

[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:58.180]
I mean this guy made Mickey day and look like I don't know what like a terrible real snappy

[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:03.620]
Anyways at the end of the hour they were ready to bid him goodbye and they also goodbye and started plotting and he goes

[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:07.360]
All right, you all have a nice life now. Oh my god

[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:10.940]
I'm amazing. He was for real. I'm amazed he didn't say boy

[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:13.960]
I thought it was great. I might want to know

[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.440]
Well, that's got a glad that they're getting some interesting guests on that show child

[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:21.420]
They need something over there. I don't know what they need you know they're playing more music now

[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:25.600]
Hey, listen, that's Joey is playing more music and Greg and Donald are playing more music

[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:31.420]
Let's hear it for all these music intensive people and herman herman and McQueen can't be found anywhere. They're playing so much music

[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:38.540]
That's it. They can't compete. I got a good idea. Neil. Yes, you know the 976 numbers. Why don't you get one 976? Neil? Yeah

[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:42.240]
You can call him a subhuman mong brain and a lot of money can get made okay

[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.680]
Well, listen to my friend Dave Ryder wants to do it. I'm ready

[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:51.200]
I love it. Take care you too. I'll tell you my share it's some of that money that that maniac is making just he's making bags full

[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:59.980]
No, okay, I know what do they say they had four and a half million calls in January or something like that? That's right to his services. Yeah, just to his service

[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:08.980]
Anyway, moving right along. Let's take one from a bokeh next. Hello. Hi. How are you this morning? Great

[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:14.660]
I thought I'd say so you know a little bit on a Howard Stern bit. Oh, yeah good old. How is he still on the air?

[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:19.060]
Yeah, he's still on the air in fact. I was up to my sister in law's wedding in the Edison, New Jersey

[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:21.320]
Right Alan Dines Day and

[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:27.400]
Some of the relatives came in from New York and for some odd reason one of the mass me a la ever heard of Howard Stern

[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:33.360]
Mm-hmm. I said sure they said we ought to listen to him and Monday they play the best of Howard Stern

[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.040]
All right

[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:39.740]
And he's about as amusing and entertaining as a kidney stone

[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:47.920]
Okay, all he did was read an article out of a magazine about some movie star that was divorcing his wife and living with his babysitter

[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.860]
While his cohort female

[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.700]
Made snide remarks about it

[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:54.140]
Probably a little bit

[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:56.560]
Not Rob Williams no

[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:01.400]
Or Robin Williams is who was my thought you were talking about robbing the sidekick. No, that's the that's Robin Quiver

[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:06.860]
He's talking about Robin Williams. Yeah, he uh, well you'd know about those robins. He's on the uh

[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:16.840]
Mm-hmm, okay, and you probably don't know the name Leonard

[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.580]
But I'm the guy that brought you the bagels that morning. Oh great. We appreciate it

[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:25.920]
And I said I'd never call a radio show, but I had to call you for this while they were great listen

[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:30.120]

Yeah, right either you that's okay. Okay. Okay

All right, how do you want to work this Robin you decide? Okay, that's enough of him

[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.700]
Okay, don't you think that's enough for today? The nice

[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:50.900]
Howard's been in small doses that was you think that does for small enough in addition to which that machine is so screwed up now

[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.440]
It's like this now. I you know, it's just my imagination

[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.920]
But you heard it with your own three years didn't you in machine number two?

[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:01.360]
We don't want to get you know down on the engineers again because they did a sensational job on almost everything

[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:08.540]
Okay, now the car machines are all messed up, but one thing at a time right we got the clocks the right time right CD player cues up
