[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940]
Before yes, I'll tell you when to kill it. You know who you're leaving this up to you know leading what up to

[00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.380]
Turning it off. I mean I appreciate you putting all this faith in me, but no, they'll give you plenty of time

[00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.620]
Okay, but I'll see I have a dot button

[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.380]
So even if you should let it go the first time which I can't imagine anybody being that stupid

[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.640]
Even you I just I'm just hope my tarot syndrome. Yeah. Yeah, see he wants to let go

[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.540]
I'm gonna get hell for just even

[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.280]
Are you gonna talk it up though?

[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:37.820]
No, I don't want to step on August moon. Okay, I might step on Peter movie, but I don't want to step on August moon

[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.840]
And the spur of the moment band. Yeah, them too

[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.760]
Well, I was driving down I 95 the other night

[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.180]
Somebody nearly cut me right off the road

[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.440]
I decided wasn't gonna do any good to get mad

[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.060]
I wrote a song about

[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.320]
Goes like this. Okay, that's as far as we go. I think that's as far as we go

[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.260]
What the great thing here in Stereology, you know, I just have so much confidence

[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.580]
I said that's as far as we go and then he had this like little

[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.940]
Lapse his reflexes suddenly got very slow, but yeah, that was good to hear again

[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.660]
I never heard it in stereo. I'd heard a whole thing would really be something that would be a first over here

[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.480]
Wouldn't it but then I just blank out that no?

[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.240]
They did that on the AM and somebody from Portland had a nervous

[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.760]
Nelly attack the other day and I just leave so even with it leaves

[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.560]
Absolutely went bananas a man who's put all of our lives in jeopardy even art flimming

[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.160]
Ever saw the kind of jeopardy put all of us in and yet he comes down has the unmitigated gall to start being nervous

[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.860]
Nelly again

[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.040]
I'm getting out now

[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.200]
And you know they I know it's just so ridiculous and they've taken away 80% of our men

[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.460]
See I want to go on record today very clearly because it's one thing they say hey, well, we don't care

[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.580]
Fine, that's great. We care. Mm-hmm. Okay. I mean, there's just no way you can have any self-respect in his business

[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.020]
When it take away 70 or 80% of your material and you can't even say good morning without somebody raising an eye

[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.680]
Brise it well, she wouldn't even mean by the way that kind of dirty the way he said that and they do that to you

[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.200]
And so I just want to say it so that people are aware that we have no choice. I mean they've taken away

[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.820]
99% really anything we can do and so here we are

[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.680]
You know and we're just showing up every day

[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.300]
We're having a great time and there's all kinds of spots in the log and everything is wonderful and some of the spots are a little

[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.800]
Risky yeah, that's true some of the commercials have some pretty risk case some dirty stuff in here to be honest with you and

[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.680]
Some of the music that they program the rest of the day many of the records

[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.820]
I could if I repeated and some of the words are in the song we'd be history by seven o'clock

[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.720]
Okay, they'd be down here with a Zeta van to drag us all away

[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.940]
Well, I don't would not push your luck. Okay, let's not here. Let's let them play it on a rest of the day

[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.720]
So we don't get help for that and but that's just the way it is and people there are those people out there

[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.200]
You've heard some of the calls when I was on with Stan that day last week in some

[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.200]
Caller and he his intentions were good. I understand where he's coming from and he's good

[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.300]
Well, you know you're too important to them and you got these big ratings and this and that and why don't you you know

[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.480]
You always stood up and you never took crap from management

[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.660]
This but the point you get to a certain point and it's like you have a choice to make you you continue paying your bills and having a livelihood

[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.440]
Or you know see you're out on a beach like Johnny dark

[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.900]
Knowledge it's true and in this business even when you think you're on top of the world

[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.160]
You've seen too many other people like friends of ours who've been out of work for too long because that's a kind of business

[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.940]
It is especially if you have any talent. Yeah, if you're a no-talent douchebag may be a job like that no problem

[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.560]
That's funny that you mention it because they're showing job service right now. Yeah, well you better take some notes

[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.480]
Okay, unless no how to read a rule or Portland doesn't listen to the music

[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.300]
They don't listen to the rest of the day. No, they just listen to the talk show

[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.360]
Yeah, they can't hand so that's why they get away with playing those records

[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.200]
Portland that's why the aim gets away with murder too because nobody is listening over there

[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.620]
So when they do something really outrageous disgusting and vol- nobody cares because nobody is listening to it

[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.560]
Okay, so if a tree falls in the forest that now that's an interesting question if a tree falls in a forest and there's no one

[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.200]
Anybody listening in Palm Beach County

[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.040]
That is one of the things that I've wondered ever since I was a child. I always wondered about that if that big oak tree

[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.000]
Yeah falls in a forest is anybody in Palm Beach here?

[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.640]
So the questions when they say those words on the AM that's why nobody nobody hears as is nobody in Palm Beach County listening

[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.000]
Of course, Dave and Broward that's another whole ball

[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.300]
That's a story that we can't even begin to get into here. That's so it's so sorted the Dave Broward story

[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.500]
630 on Zeta 4 your

[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.980]
Non-communicative station here on a Tuesday morning. Well, Clarence just called they really well, it's wonderful

[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.820]
They were not taking calls but Clarence still called in yeah, what do you say one of these days?

[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.660]
I'm gonna find him and I'm just gonna put my hands around his neck and just beat the crap out of him

[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.380]
Really but for now I enjoy here having him call now you're taking it personally now you're getting

[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.220]
I just have this desire just to beat the crap out of somebody

[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.240]
It is an interesting study inside college. You the fact that here is somebody who despises me allegedly

[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.020]
It's such an agreement yet is there every day

[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.620]
I mean if there was nobody else out there in the audience no one you know at least that Clarence would be there

[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.800]
Okay, see it seems to me if I didn't like a TV host

[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.400]
You know, right? You have turned it off. I wouldn't want you know see that's what most of us would do

[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.040]
But there's something out there. There's this compulsion this obsession

[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.080]
Mm-hmm

[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.540]
In fact, we do have people who despise like to see us just

[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.480]
Riding and agony on the rack twisting in the wind who make a point of listening

[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.760]
Every single day who wouldn't miss a minute if their lives depended upon it. Okay, if the house was burning

[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.040]
It's a lot of people they go up and flames with it because they wouldn't have the time to divert their attention from this program

[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.700]
And the Orwellian thing about it is he hates us so much and now he's like a character on the show

[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.800]
So somebody ran into it with a furious throw. They say hey Clarence turn to this morning

[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.020]
Yeah, yeah

[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.020]
That is so be I'm on his show. I'm gonna get the end boy

[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.640]
Ask Rosadogra. Yeah, yeah, he probably will be showing up signing pictures at our next thing

[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.820]
You know

[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.180]
Surprise me at some strange people show up but our things you know

[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:21.200]
632 on Zeta 4 and we haven't taken any calls. It's almost an hour that's gone by and I don't really feel any guilt or any

[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.200]
Pressure from it. I don't feel that we've done anything evil

[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.440]
I don't feel any void in my life. Do you know we have a feeling if we haven't missed anything

[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.100]
That was a very good way of putting it. I couldn't have said it better myself. We haven't really missed a thing

[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.220]
We probably missed several people saying oh hey, we really love your show and oh it's great

[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.600]
You and the high-level burden captain day that have a wonderful day and audio sir. We've been there

[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.900]
These are pretty terminal phone calls. Yeah, and it's just a kind of town

[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.880]
It is and like I've said for years if the people on the air can't be more entertaining that a bunch of would be amateur hour

[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.920]
Would be whatever they are would be human beings out there in the audience and there's something wrong

[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.660]
Well three of them so maybe once in a while on the show from now on we'll take a caller too and that's it

[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:09.820]
It's a good idea the first three that I answered asked is Neil there so it might not be a good idea. Yeah, they're really sharp

[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:15.800]
Wow shop is a multiple soggy July day. That's a good question. Do you think what is Neil there?

[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.040]
Is he?

[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.700]
Good question. We'll be having the answer for that in the seven o'clock hours

[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.220]
We should have called all your friends and neighbors say yes

[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:32.200]
Guess what y'all I could do the whole show. We could do our convenience store show and we can talk about rednecks and

[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.620]
Pickled eggs and sausages

[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.340]
sure

[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.600]
And of course now that they also have lottery tickets man you can you can camp out at you toe

[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:46.300]
You can just take your brown bag and go down there and camp out the whole day and have a couple of pickle eggs and buy some lottery tickets and

[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.820]
scratch them off and

[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:53.580]
Well, I'm kind of a circle K guy. Let's get some of that red man and put a little chaw in there and

[00:07:53.580 --> 00:08:01.120]
Hey, what the hell else could anybody want then by three o'clock you'd be brown bagging it with a button and a little brown bag out in the parking lot meeting all the other brown

[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.720]
Baggers

[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.680]
Johnny what life is all about Johnny dark. Johnny. Depp maybe

[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:11.740]
Johnny. How's that the convenience store? Well, he's gonna know Johnny. Depp's got a little more class than that, doesn't he?

[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.000]
Well, he lived outside of convenience store one time. Oh, but he was in his car

[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.080]
He only went inside for real urgent necessities

[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:24.680]
Like he'd go in to see mr. Whipple every once in a while. I bet don't you wonder about that when somebody lives in their car like

[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.620]
How do they take a shower? I mean a windshield wipers don't do that good of a job

[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.900]
You know, even if you got good washers. It's just

[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:36.200]
And it's a good Vietnam, you know when it starts to rain you grab a bar of soap and

[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.940]
And run out. Listen, that's a hell of a good idea if Rick weaver's listening to the show right now

[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.100]
70% chance of showers is right. There's a good thing

[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.380]
Anybody in the neighborhoods got an extra bar of right guard or or of dial rather

[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.420]
Or a right guard couldn't hurt too. You know

[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:56.700]
Afterward, but some dial or ivory or iris spring or something just grab a bar and head on out

[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.660]
They just stand outside for a couple hours start making it and when it starts coming down that lather yourself up

[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.360]
And god, it's a free shower

[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.000]
It's right to work and it'll make headlines. I bet you he'd make CNN and you PI in the whole bit

[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.900]
Don't you think sure? It would certainly be a major news event in this town

[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:19.980]
635 on zeta four wzta my me beach for a lot of nail upon beaches. Oh just Delray deer field and for all you and teaks in

neo-rogy's the rock and roll monster

[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:10.120]
I'm clear in this time. I'm gonna prolong with 18 till seven on your antiseptic station zeta four

[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.940]
Are you having a good time there with you?

[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.760]
I said it and I notice you're looking at a lot of pictures this color is some into colors. Are you really?

[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.060]
Okay, boys and girls. Let's get out our creolas this morning

[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:29.020]
And let's take the mimey herald and the sun sentinel and colorize it all the bland black and white newspapers that mommy and daddy are trying to read this morning

[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.180]
While they're busy taking their shower or whatever else are doing get out your creolas

[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.360]
And color it up, you know like take some

[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.460]
Red for example. I go over where it talks about those commie pinkos

[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:46.020]
And just swear read all over it to the point where mommy and daddy can't even read it anymore because it's kind of depressing anyway, right?

[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:51.760]
Or it says something about the cremlin and grubbichoff and the summit now this is important into the spaceball players fashion

[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.820]
I think that is pretty important and now who is this much more important

[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.580]
And that other look at that all dolled up at rj Reynolds isn't that exciting?

[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:09.800]
And I like his tobacco company by the way they're one of my favorites really and here's Barry bonds and Mike Diaz all in color and

[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.000]
Jeff Robinson

[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:19.200]
And Darrell coals and John Kangaloci. I don't have any idea who the hell that is. Oh, he's from high alia

[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.920]
Is he I never heard of John Kangaloci at all anyway. This is about baseball players

[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:31.080]
Fashion oh these are the pirates. Oh excuse me. I don't know who John Kangaloci is

[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.800]
Well, that goes to share that's why I'm out of touch

[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.260]
I mean, I do recognize these other people but the Darnell coals and Barry bonds

[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.380]
rj Reynolds, but what the hell could I say that we haven't said

[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.360]
Sooting up the pirates and the styles of summer

[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.060]
And we got a full page with color pictures and

[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:56.560]
diagrams and body parts and I don't think we can discuss that any further see and there's who's that on the front of that

[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.320]
Now who is that that's uh

[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:07.340]
George Lynch. I don't know George dockens George Lynch who's dockens. I don't know

Wow, where's Lynch rips into an ear blaster that we can kick off to the heavy metal monsters are rock tour

[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:33.000]

[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.340]
Heavy metal not this crowd this audience don't know dockin from sockin, okay

[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.240]
971 tons of sound stage and lighting gear for the monsters of rock tour

[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.780]
And this time is really just on crazy about it hasn't

Dire about all seven of those pinheads or into that stuff are gonna be there with bells on man

[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.140]
They just go and nuts this is one main dance yeah

645 on zeta 4 and time for this

[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:24.720]
Hello, I'm michelle is the schnook and tonight's on masterpiece theater episode six of the spuds mckenzie chronicles

[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.620]
As you'll recall when we last left our pooch face protagonist

[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:34.980]
He was seated poolside wearing his customary dark glasses and wildly playing his bongos

[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:42.400]
This bizarre because of exhibition apparently acted as an emperor deezag on the scantley clad bimboes

[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:51.240]
Attending this hedonistic affair and within moments these new-biased impacts were stroking spuds head and clearly displaying a perverse

[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.220]
sexual attraction to him

[00:13:53.220 --> 00:14:01.000]
Well quite a dilemma for as we shall see tonight spuds is about to go into heat and begin a torrid affair with that little doggy

[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.160]
Who chases the chuck wagon stage coach across the kitchen floor and under the sink

[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:11.100]
So do join us won't you for must-to-piece theater I'm michelle is the schnook

[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:19.960]
you

[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.500]
Docent yeah

[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.440]
I know we get them on real quick like

[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.340]
DJ docate

[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:43.200]
I'll tell you how come to the audiences this morning now there's got to be somebody out there who knows from docin okay

[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:49.120]
Sure and you ask you and it like still nothing you know like there's a couple of blinks here and there these people are dead

[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.200]
The walking day

[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.180]
And laying down there

[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.660]
It is frightening isn't it but the

[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:07.560]
Have no fear the rain is just pouring down cats and dogs and they're pretty happy about it the centaurie house

[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.320]
647 307 on Zeta 4 you're absolutely a totally

[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:18.580]
Responseless station and these this town boy just absolutely dead isn't it you're right about this day totally and thoroughly

[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.280]
This could be remember the song the night Chicago died

[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.080]
Sure of course I do this could be the day that South Florida the whole part of it just died

[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.300]
It's been like an intensive care for a long time

[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.320]
But this could be the turning point like somebody turned off the oxygen

[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:40.320]
And you've been in the eight-track room the past couple of days I know it's because of the rain, but it smells like sewage in there

[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.600]
Oh no jay michael just came back to the Bahamas again

[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:49.640]
It does he just brought some souvenirs back from the Bahamas from that one hotel

[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.080]
You know where they have the shaggy dogs melody over here

[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.560]
It smells like sewage in there it makes you finish the commercials faster

[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.300]
Maybe that's part of the attack to get people out of there a lot faster

[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.760]
Anyway, we have food from shells coming up later on today

[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.240]
We got seafood so we're not worried about it. We'll survive

[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.220]
We got our food coming we got one hour already killed here this morning almost exactly an hour

[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:19.200]
And the rain is coming down like crazy it just pouring pelting down here in carol city it is brutal

[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.680]
And it's gray and dank and now I know how Noah fell

[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.340]
haha

[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:32.440]
I'm cereal this has gone on for days and days and days on in them. No it relief in sight

[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.900]
Nettle end when this week you're sure is an official of prognostication

[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.600]
I do the weather, don't I? I don't know what I'm talking about it. Now it's not gonna end tomorrow

[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.480]
But by the weekend you know you've been talking to that guy in WWR

[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.060]
Loyalty young

[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.180]
Hello homestead

[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.760]
Oh, he's

[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.120]
Funny

[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.460]
I like he's no water. Cronice but

[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:04.660]
Yeah, do you have the seal of approval from the American meteorological society?

[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.740]
He has the squeal of approval right well, let's just see if my prediction comes true

[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:15.320]
That in swing over the day sometime by the weekend would be something if it never ended wouldn't it if it just goes on like this forever

[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.460]
Because I get that feeling and just horrible

[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.440]
Gray and dank indie print no one of these bastards out there

[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.800]
No, I want to get out of bed and go to the phone or anything. They want to just lie there and

[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.160]
Never get out understandable

[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:32.040]
Remember that time it was I think it was either 80 or 81 it was like this for two months

[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:37.380]
We kept a record of it every day was either cloudy or it continually rained that's true

[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.040]
Why summer times are swell in South Florida

[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:46.320]
Do you do oh is this mean it's news time sure does that's your cue all right 10 before seven

[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:51.900]
Zeta and we missed it because of the clouds, but this was the morning at 653

[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.120]
Which is the medicine way you can't see it the blue moon

[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.560]
I talked about last week

[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.540]
And of course this only happens once in a blue moon

[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:06.780]
There is a blue moon up there today now actually today's event has nothing to do with the color of the moon

[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.440]
It's actually the second appearance of a full moon in the same month

[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:19.320]
However officials at the US Naval Observatory in Washington say there is such a thing as a condition in which small particles in the atmosphere

[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.320]
Make the moon look blue

[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:26.540]
And they say this doesn't happen often it happens about once in a blue moon

[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.300]
So we missed it today. Sorry. I saw some of the light from him but no

[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.940]
A luckless man has been charged with a string of robberies in which you take a minute

[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.120]
Oh, I'm sorry. You don't want to recap. So anyway

[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:43.660]
There is a blue moon this morning 653 which is about two minutes away

[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:48.420]
But it's not really a blue moon now and we can't see it because it's all overcast

[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:08.660]
Oh

[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.100]
Like I said before there's nothing I hate worse than novelty records. Okay

[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:18.960]
You know that was worth waiting for anyway a luckless man has been charged for the string of robberies in which he took

[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.140]
1500 lottery tickets and hopes of winning the jackpot

[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:31.000]
Didn't get the million dollar winner police Miami said he was booked on charges of armed robbery and grand theft and connection with three separate

[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.240]
robberies of seven eleven stores last week detective

[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:41.520]
Says it was the first case metro day detectives knew of which a robbery a robber

[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:47.720]
Only took tickets. He didn't take any money didn't take any food nothing just just ticket

[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:53.200]
Priorities mostly cloudy today showers and thunderstorms are likely rain chance 70 percent

[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.340]
High only in the low 80s

[00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:00.600]
Tonight still a good chance of showers low 74 and it's 74 this morning on theta

[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.640]
It's 652

[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.880]
Six minutes till seven on theta four and because food's coming

[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:19.300]
And just a little bit from the shelves this morning. I thought maybe this might just kind of fit into the tenor of the whole show

[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:30.740]
And

[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.040]
Guys

[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.080]
He

[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.060]
Is

[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:54.480]
Okay, it's 65 now we weren't gonna take any calls at all, but we do have a docking fan on the phone. Is this correct?

[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.300]
That's me now what be what be dockin sir

[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.000]
Dog can be like a two-bit

[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.840]
Heavy metal band. They're really not much. They've been opening acts for like seven years

[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:13.500]
Really on other words, they just come out in a tease for the amps about 30 45 minutes when they go back collect a small check and go home

[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.000]
Yeah, they sing a song to the nail and a couple others

[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.420]
I'm going to the concert, but I'm not going to go seek dockin

[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.660]
No, I don't think too many people are buying you know grab it up docking tickets

[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:30.040]
No, no, not really have when they come on. I think that's what I'm going to go by my shirt

[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:37.520]
Wasn't a great though that they have chosen in USA today to put a big picture of the elite singer from docking in there

[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.840]
I know there's so many other groups like scorpions, you know, that's a big group

[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.600]
Yeah, really and they're not even headlining them you know, it's like you know our docking

[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.420]
You know like who cares about that?

[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.820]
There's another way to look at it isn't it about time after all these years and all these months that they've been going out there and

[00:21:53.820 --> 00:22:00.560]
Doing their thing and probably making very little money and getting no publicity isn't nice at somebody finally recognize them

[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.840]
Yeah, I guess so all right dockin. Yeah exactly

[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.200]
That's here for docking right this one's for docking, you know, I'm going to go and just you know

[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:15.140]
Yeah, my brain's out just for docking exactly. I think we had I have a gigantic group of docking fans here

[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:20.660]
I'm more of a you know scorpions Metallica and fan Helen fans. Oh, yeah

[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.080]
Kingdom come

[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:32.060]
I know that you're gonna hate to miss the concert and whatnot. So I was wondering if you want me to bring I'd like to

[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:37.140]
Bring you back a shirt, you know, I'd lock yeah, I'd give anything for a docking

[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:43.020]
Yeah, okay, I'll get your docking. Okay. We'll be looking forward to that with baited breath. Okay, right?

[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:48.340]
Neil I want to ask you one more thing. Yeah, you're that new cheap trick yet. No, and it is a good tune

[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:49.420]
flame

[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.300]
Yeah, but you said you said wait a minute wait a minute you said you said new

[00:22:55.300 --> 00:23:00.820]
Yes, new. Well, see new is we don't play from new around here. Okay, we don't know what's no

[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:08.820]
New Roger show it's like at a point anything goes just about right? Okay, I'll go out and buy it today and we'll play it tomorrow

[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:13.080]
Okay, you know, you got to deal. Okay, all right see you after the concert. Okay docking

[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.240]
657 on Zeta 4 now that's true. I got to go out and buy anything we want to play on the show

[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.860]
It's it's really like kind of a joke at this point, isn't it

[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:27.160]
Maybe we should alternate like one week Glenn buy about four or five CDs and the next week I could buy a few and

[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:33.660]
Pretty soon we've got the only station in America where the morning team has to go out and build the library

[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:39.380]
I never heard of such a thing. I keep saying that and the Rose never technology never in any way

[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.780]
acknowledges that like they replaced one

[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.360]
CD no two or three two or three

[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:53.060]
As a matter of fact all these that says new CDs on the on the door no, no, you're not you're not understanding what I'm saying

[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.400]
They were they reimbursed me in other words they gave me back

[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.540]
The birds okay the best of the birds

[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:05.880]
and the guess who and the animals and I do see them in the record stores constantly

[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:12.340]
So it's not like they don't exist. Well, they don't just get this feeling that they kind of like the fact that I'm spending 80% of my paycheck

[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:16.280]
Going out and building the library up. Yeah, it's a little ridiculous like working. It's kind of like a minus

[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.740]
cash flow situation. Okay, well you can write it off though

[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.280]
You can write all those I don't want to write it off

[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.460]
I want them to go out and and do something. I want them to get their stuff together

[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.160]
Okay, and go out and build a library and if we're going to be classic anything

[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.900]
You've got to have material you can't just keep playing the same you know 800 CDs

[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:43.360]
750 of which we don't play because there's nothing on them. I mean we do have this expansive library near the room there, but if you notice

[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:49.360]
Most of it doesn't get played. There's a lot of stuff in there that just gathering dust on those shelves

[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.700]
Like the best of docking

[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.220]
They don't play that

[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.260]
Yeah, right

[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:56.980]
Oh, god

[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]
Yeah, white snake 659 on zeta 4 here's a quick look at those scores again

[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.640]
And as I said at the beginning of the show I don't want to discuss this

[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:10.000]
I don't want to get into it and it's obvious the audience right from the beginning didn't want to discuss this or anything else with us either

[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.920]
Selvix beat Detroit yesterday 7 to 9 to 78

[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:18.560]
I don't want to hear about it. I see the word weird there on the USA today's fourth section weird doesn't come close

[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.860]
To describing it. It was an exhibition was shameful disgraceful both teams out of hang their heads in shame

[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:29.140]
And they all ought to be arrested for impersonating professional basketball players. It was there was disgusting

[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:35.020]

So sis what'd you and Rom do last night? Well since it was our anniversary

[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:13.700]
We thought we did

[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:14.040]
Oh

[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.780]
Celebrating birthday today

[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:31.540]
This woman is having a merry heart attack people are buying more twizzlers for let it

[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.840]
If she doesn't receive immediate medical attention she'll go into permanence indication

[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:42.920]
I've just received 200 cc's of lidocaine and had these electrodes attached to my chest

[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:50.080]
Learn and recognize the early warning signs and uncontrollable crossing and uncrossing the legs

[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:57.520]
Excessive perqueness as an annoying preoccupation with the superficial and Rob Lowe's favorite Beatles is Ringo

[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:01.720]
When he was killed call your local merry heart association today

[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.340]
Because just one merry heart is too many

[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.080]
Okay, and I wonder how many times that shows on today. What about six or seven?

[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.180]
Great. I can't wait the more of the better

[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.500]
It's a minute past seven on say to four your phone call is station

[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:19.360]
I just you know they say that when you stop like in baseball or any other sport

[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.320]
Whatever it is or I guess actors to the same thing when you stop having fun

[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.020]
That's the time to retire, okay

[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.880]
And I got to be honest with you. I'm just not having fun this morning

[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.420]
Are you having fun?

[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:39.540]
Uh, you're always having fun. That's the problem as long as you're working you're having fun

[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:46.300]
Uh, I wouldn't say I'm having a bad time now and I see that's a cop-out that's not a direct. There. That's an easy

[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:52.280]
That's my question. I'm not having fun because uh, this is it's so depressing

[00:27:53.200 --> 00:28:00.580]
It's like standing up on an empty stage and giving all your best material and really belting it all out any audience is just like

[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:08.120]
Not there comatose. Yeah, this time and just puts you into deep into a rip van winkle kind of mentality

[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.200]
Hmm

[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.100]
Now I'm just not having fun. It's time to hang it up. I think I

[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:22.780]
Mean there's like a message in this. I think that there comes a time like the song says we are the world

[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:31.600]
There comes a time when uh, it's time now don't ever react, okay? Yeah, we're gonna feel a lot better when shelves comes in here with the food

[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:36.320]
Yeah, you can't eat for four hours every day. Although it is certainly something to think about

[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.860]
I don't know about that. It's too bad. We don't have any cards or something

[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:44.640]
Yeah, we get a card game going this morning. How about old me? That would be good for this time. I'd go fish

[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:50.840]
Yeah, old made rainbow fish. Yeah, or go fish old made. I think it would be excellent. Okay for all our friends in a allen Dale

[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:58.780]
You know, I just want to suggest something to you when you get in your automobile this morning and to drive out and you wonder where the usual traffic

[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.400]
Jamies and where there's nobody out there. I was okay. They've all left town over the weekend

[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.380]
Well, they sure weren't out yesterday. It was like a ghost town really yesterday. Didn't you

[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:12.440]
You get the feeling like we're all alone like everybody is gone or dead. Yeah

[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:18.300]
Like a possible everybody died over the weekend and nobody you know, it didn't make the paper yet like on the beach

[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.580]
Do we have a hero yet? No, no

[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:27.400]
See that's the first piece of evidence. You know, why the delivery boys so well how can I put it delicately? Okay?

[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:34.680]
So this is like a movie. Yeah, this is like now. What was that movie with Charlton Heston? Oh

[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:41.080]
The Omega man. The Omega man. Yeah, that was a good movie even with a fascist like Charlton Heston and there was a good movie and

[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:47.760]
um, not seriously and in fact years before that the original one was with Vincent Price and it had a different name

[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:55.660]
But it was the same story and it was after your world were after this nuclear holocaust and there were just a handful of people left

[00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:01.080]
And they were all running around looting supermarkets trying to find something that was edible and

[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:08.540]
Just totally paranoid running around with guns ready to shoot anybody else that they have perceived to be a threat sort of like Miami

[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:11.620]
Yeah, exactly kind of like going into Miami right now

[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.240]
You know what I mean

[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.140]
Boy, this is gonna make you feel better. Is it really?

[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:23.940]
The weather today. Oh jay four minutes after seven on zeta four do we have to do this? It has cleared up a little bit

[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:29.320]
Still I see some blue I see it still a couple of rain drops dripping down a carol

[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:33.000]
But there is a little tiny patch of blue, but wait a year this

[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:37.280]
Mostly cloudy with showers and thunderstorms likely rain chance

[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.040]
70% today. Oh

[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.420]
High only in the low 80s. I feel like Rick and Spud's you know

[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:48.340]
I just can't wake up in the morning. That's how I feel like I want to go back to sleep

[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.700]
I mean if the audience wants to be asleep

[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.320]
We can be asleep too with a window open and the rain trickling outside

[00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:00.280]
Tonight there'll still be a good chance of showers low about 74. I think we might even play the rest of um

[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:01.840]
That record

[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:08.340]
August and the uh spur of the moment spur of the moment band. Yeah. Yeah, that would wake him up

[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:14.180]
Is sure would 74 degrees this morning at zeta four and it's coming up on six after seven

[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:17.820]
707 on zeta four on a just wonderful Tuesday morning man

[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:21.280]
This is so good that I'm ready to go back home and start putting weebies back on the grill

[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:26.480]
Weebies. Yeah weebies on the grill. I bet your Bruce Jenner cooks his weebies on the grill

[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:32.100]
Anyway, there's a little patch of blue. I was thinking maybe we could do a play by play on the clouds and a cloud cover

[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:38.320]
Because there's some real heavy cumulus over here and some uh syrus like up in the upper atmosphere there

[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:46.380]
Some wispy syrus. That's the first blue I've seen since like last Thursday. Yeah, and they're a little bit well yesterday when I left when I went home

[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:53.260]
As you got north of steward 84 it wasn't raining anymore and it was it wasn't that bad wasn't great

[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:59.420]
And then of course within 30 minutes it was pouring cats and dogs up by me, but um, so there was there were moments

[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:04.220]
Yeah, and when you're on the air course if there were people listening this morning which there aren't but if there were

[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:08.340]
You know, it's kind of bizarre because there are people listening in certain places where the sun is shining

[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:13.220]
And it's pretty decent and then there are other people where it's just pouring down and you're sitting here

[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:16.080]
And you're saying all these things and you can only judge by looking out this little window

[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:16.480]
Right

[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:21.880]
And your perspective is limited, but I will say this the wind is blowing at a pretty good and pretty brisk rate in the

[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:28.620]
Upper atmosphere there and it's zipping by those lower dark. Thank you. Look at that. Look how it's clearing up even as we speak

[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:29.320]
I'm cereal

[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.300]
But I don't think it's gonna last I think it's gonna

[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:38.360]
Come back the clouds and the rain. I do. I think it's said. This is just what are you some kind of a communist?

[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:42.380]
Just a brief. Why do you have to say? I don't want to get your hopes up

[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:45.840]
I want to be a real optimistic that we have to sit here and hope that it's

[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:50.300]
I'm not gonna be I'm gonna be up weeks on end. I'm gonna be realistic

[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:56.520]
Sorry. Oh god. You're gonna be in this town and you gonna be realistic. I don't think you're gonna survive. I couldn't do it

[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:01.660]
I have to blue sky myself if you part of that expression all the time. Oh, that's why you're doing that

[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.060]
That's a Bruce Sanger. Oh look at that look at that blue up there

[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.140]
I'm just a little hole in the sky there Bruce Sanger a

[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.800]
Jr. That matches Bruce's the hole in the head

[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:18.240]
It's 709 on Zeta 4 and I'm gonna give the numbers out one time and if you are something I'm thinking to myself

[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:27.160]
Who am I kidding? Okay, in other words the only reason we've been doing what we've been doing for last hour and 20 minutes is because we have an audience that doesn't you know

[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.220]
They got on a new tangent now

[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:33.040]
It's like we've gotten to get another phase of apathy

[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:37.840]
So therefore we're like we're working five times as hard and

[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:43.520]
Just straining here to make some pretence of enjoying being just

[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.240]
Ignored okay by the masses out there

[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:51.900]
And this is supposed to be a talk show. We're supposed to have these enthusiastic loyalists just get on the phone

[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.820]
And hey, what's going on? I mean, hey guess what the game released stunk or man

[00:33:55.820 --> 00:34:00.820]
Do you remember in 72 when it rained for 400 years in a row and what is something you know? Mm-hmm

[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:06.600]
These are supposed to be people who are alive or least pretending so you can try and I think I don't think that they're pretending anymore

[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:13.580]
I think they're finally infesting up to what the real story is here in the land of the walking dead did you talk about a

[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:16.960]
air conditioners?

[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:22.520]
No, no, did I talk about air conditioners? Oh in other words, I missed the spot is that what you said?

[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.680]
I didn't miss well. He's got the word live. There is so many times and he jams all of these in one hour, you know, it's just

[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.080]
Oh, so you're gonna talk about that now oh

[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.500]
Yeah, what the hell why not

[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:38.060]
I'm about the weather and all this is a good time. No, I agree. Is that all right? Sure. Oh

[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:42.320]
I'm looking forward to it. We got traffic too when you're done great. That's good

[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.620]
Well, maybe we won't take because you're not all it up

[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:47.260]
We got five lines for you, but these people are dead

[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:51.800]
Maybe the show is pass A maybe it's all over with okay, and that's that's fine

[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:56.600]
We'll just come in every day and play bits. Well, it's been fun. I feel like somebody else. I know you know, and like I said

[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:03.160]
It's not it isn't a direct response to the footage but when you come in in the morning at six o'clock and nobody wants to talk to you

[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.180]
Then that's a different story

[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:09.280]
That's a whole different ballgame. That's like a slap in the face. You know what I mean?

[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:16.300]
Like that. It's like a kick in the ass. Where we have five stinking phone calls. Yeah, we got six stinking calls on there

[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.960]
On our six stinking lines

[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:23.880]
