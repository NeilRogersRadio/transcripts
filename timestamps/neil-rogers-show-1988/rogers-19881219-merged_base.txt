[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340]
First of all, Sonny gave us the grant for the committal size and I don't want to see anything bad happen

[00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.540]
So I'm not going to be the one to circulate

[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.360]
Rumors unless so we can get to the bottom of them. Okay?

[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.300]
You follow what I'm saying. I'm sure Sonny's listening. Well, let's hear from him. Yeah, it's 11 before 11 at W I O D

[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.240]
and

[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.800]
I'm I'll use talk radio six times double

[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.520]
Gee, that's interesting. I think at home and now it's my fault

[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.340]
I didn't have the light was not on the machine

[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.400]
Yeah, and I punched this I don't do my job as well when I'm constantly

[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.520]
And it didn't play it's 10 53 7 before 11 at W I O D boy. This is gonna be one hell of a day

[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.500]
Is it it's gonna be one hell of a day full already?

[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.400]
Yeah, and then it turns out that we work

[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.480]
next Monday. I'll be damn

[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.900]
That's a holiday. It's the big holiday of the year. See there's another reason we keep telling you people don't get in this business

[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.040]
Yeah, that's another reason for it. There are no holidays in this business

[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.600]
Mm-hmm. I mean there are days when the building is so barren

[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.060]
That you would think they were evacuating that it was a fired roller something

[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.120]
but the the talent man is still on the air. Yeah, like thanks, right?

[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.420]
Thanksgiving Christmas

[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.780]
Sookas

[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.660]
That was the final blow for me at the other place. Well, we had to work on Sookas

[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.460]
I said Pete take this job and you cover man

[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.500]
It was rough on me too, you know, no seriously

[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.180]
I even had my my own personal handwritten excuse from it's hot

[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.160]
Come here and it didn't do a bit of good over there too many goiam and I've placed

[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.900]
Yeah, you're right today does suck Roger. There's a nightmare. This is like a bad dream that we're never gonna escape from

[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.820]
He's got a bad morning. I wasn't happy when Erie was kind of sour this morning. He's getting the flu or something

[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.620]
Mobile hello. Hello, Neil. Yeah, I'm doing today. Okay. This is Jeff over at the pizza lot. Hey Jeff

[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.000]
How are you? I'm in the middle of making your salad. Hey, that's great

[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.600]
Actually not with my own two hands and some on the way to work

[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.760]
But I have the chef working on it already and I don't know tell me you're like Michael Kane and you're making it with somebody else's hand

[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.960]
Okay, you ever see that movie where he gets his hand chopped off and had car accident? No, I can't

[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.920]
Trust me you're lucky talk the hand. Is it called a hand? Well, that's a I guess it could have been called a foot or something like that, but

[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.980]
Well, that's great Jeff. So anyway, we'll see you in a little bit with it. Thanks and

[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.560]
Thanks, thank you. All right. Bye. Bye. Bye. Now that's nice and

[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.440]
1055 at W. I. D. We have a spy report from Cox on the radio

[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.840]
Who I can barely hear

[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.740]
Get a new phone will you?

[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.560]
Just a muffled bad sounds like that station we used to work on

[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.800]
Speak up. You hear me now. Well, so to speak

[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.940]
He's got more

[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.100]
My home. Yeah, really? Oh, you're in the house now what a go out to the car in Paris, huh?

[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.540]
You gonna be better now just a little bit of yeah

[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.600]
Let's margin

[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.480]
Well, why don't you say something and tell you that sunny was officially not allowed under anymore officially

[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.720]
He's not there anymore really who's on there?

[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.600]
The room has a garage of one from Texas. Oh, no, not another guy from Texas. I guess that's the room anyway

[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.400]
Now who's this is this the lieutenant?

[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.180]
Maybe this is the four-fledged general the general

[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.140]
Wow, no sunny was it my home on Saturday really?

[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.840]
Oh wait a minute rumor control. There's a rumor that Sonny's going to Waxie. Have you heard anything about that?

[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:47.000]
I have heard some that but I think

[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.680]
Really yeah, I've heard some stuff about that

[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.860]
Really

[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.680]
Well, I'm tired of this not one man that

[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.580]
So to rumors about your Christmas party over there power 96 this week

[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.100]
Yeah, I'm holy what every time that power man every time they do something

[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.260]
Right away got the cops in there

[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.020]
And a bunch of rowdy kids going crazy and then Tanner starts giving all these disclaimers and man

[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.660]
You why can't you guys keep it on the computer?

[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:37.340]
That Christmas parties is that they are designed for the bar staff to play farm and it's the one time a year when you get to tell them exactly what you think

[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.420]
Well, maybe for you I tell them what I think every day on a show

[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.100]
You know

[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.460]
I don't think that our opinions about the ownership are much different

[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.440]
But you're along with the most of the time, but we don't we don't have a problem. Yeah, whatever you say done

[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.240]
The situation I mean right now is probably the best I've ever met

[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.680]
Well, that's great. I felt that way too until this morning and I just

[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.580]
I'm just a one of those moves. Listen. It's been nice talking to you at the same time, but have a nice day

[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.600]
Yeah

[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.880]
He received the letter on Saturday you are so distorted man. Okay. He received a letter on Saturday

[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.540]
Well, did he offer it or did he

[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.620]
I see

[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.660]
Well, so I guess he was dismissed. Let go

[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.920]
Put on

[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.320]
So in other words what you're saying there may be a little litigation involved there

[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.780]
Okay, well, that's unusual for this business in it. Okay. Good luck. You done

[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.940]
Good night. Bye

[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.920]
He's got to get a new phone. Okay with all the money he makes over there man

[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.940]
He should at least not seriously ought to get a phone at works goes with the two crappiest sounding phone

[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:07.800]
Yeah, I think he bought him a came art. They sounded like it. There's a great line in a movie rainman. There's a tremendous line

[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.940]
Dustin Hoffman who is like autistic the brother Tom Cruise's brother

[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.900]
Mm-hmm and they're driving from Cincinnati from the father's funeral all the way back to California and

[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.660]
Dustin Hoffman keeps wanting to make him turn around and go back to Cincinnati to buy him a new pair of underwear at came art

[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.640]
Okay, because he buys everything all his clothes at came art and toward the end of the movie

[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:36.640]
Somebody says to Dustin Hoffman now don't want you feel better when you put on your suit from came art and he says came art sucks

[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.200]
You have to see the whole movie. I just had tremendous seriously with all this other depressing stuff going on

[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.120]
In fact, if Sonny's listening go out and see it today because you probably got a little bit of time to do it

[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.400]
But rainman it just remains one of the best

[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.180]
Ever I wonder if Jack dirty likes it

[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.520]
Probably get a review from him because it sounded like one of his friends calling an earlier couple of calls back

[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.740]
Didn't okay. We have an open date if you move real quickly

[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.540]
751 W I O D. It's rumor Monday man the rumors are flying and there's a lot of other stuff flying too

[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:11.480]
Which we can't to describe on a year and then Steve this afternoon speaking of stuff flying and when we come back after the news

[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.080]
We'll figure out what it is. He's got okay

[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:21.080]
He's got something to they all yeah another contrived debate today Nick Navarro and the Joel Herschhorn with contrived stuff on a cane show on W I O D

[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.580]
There's Neil Rogers on new start radio 610 W I O D and now you know

[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.480]
The rest of the story. That's what you think okay. It's 1105 at W I O D

[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.660]
And we have an open line in Broward if you move like the wind

[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:47.360]
524 9463 524 W I O D now don't start cackling you get those old parts real upset again when you start cackling

[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.860]
Okay, and that's why it's you sound too happy

[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.280]
They get very very upset. I know yeah

[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.900]
So we got problem in this time. We got a bunch of crappy old parts and if they don't like something

[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.660]
They just can't go away. They're gonna change it so they think

[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:09.920]
Gonna change it come hell or high water through every tactic known to man and some that haven't been invented yet

[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.820]
Because they got another incredible letter which is winning the waste basket from some douchebag in Fort Lauderdale

[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:21.940]
Threatening the management me and Steve and you and your silly laughter and the Steve talking about crotch watching

[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.140]
There's anything that this guy likes on the station, but rather again then turning it off

[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.560]
And choosing to do something more productive

[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.420]
He's got to go through this big song and a dance and it ain't gonna do him any good okay

[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:37.160]
Not the least bit of good and I go back to what I said you imagine

[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:43.240]
I mean, I know that Howard's got you know a few nuts in New York and Greece man and all these other people all over the country

[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.740]
But can you imagine the Howard Stern show being changed because of a half a dozen

[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.800]
Lackos out there who just refused to turn it off and listen to something else and

[00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:01.880]
Robin laughs as much if not more than I probably more and I've never ever heard anyone probably more with less reason

[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.480]
Yes at everything he says literally

[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.960]
And good morning that yes and apparently in New York City they like laughter

[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:16.480]
But in South Florida they hate la ha or anything that has to do with a good time or people haven't having fun

[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.000]
Cox didn't tell it but the powerhead their

[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.140]
Christmas party on Hollywood beach they returned to the crime last week. Yeah, and some old people called cops on them

[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.360]
Because party got a little out of the

[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.740]
Little two-footed time

[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:35.440]
Those sick and tired of these old farts man, you know Steve had those two shows last week with a condo

[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.840]
You know the Grinches that stole Christmas Hanukkah and took us all at the same time with a nine-year-old girl

[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.560]
Yeah, and then the people with the pets that Eleanor whatever her name was Bernstein

[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.800]
That hated the pets wants them out

[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.420]
Hmm everything you want to do in this time, man. You got a bunch of these just

[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.520]
Neanderthal old

[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.360]
Necrepid farts

[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.680]
That they want everybody to just be exactly like they are

[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.600]
Yeah, you know

[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.020]
Then the whole time could be on schedule, you know, we could all take our metamusel at the same time

[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.100]
We could all put our teeth in a glass at the same time everybody could be on schedule

[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.420]
I want to caution tell the story but no need to call back but maybe another day

[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.700]
Don't let them call back on

[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:25.240]
But another day you're gonna have a good time. I think tomorrow and Wednesday doing the show because I'm definitely getting something

[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.460]
That's I was scratching my throat. Uh-huh. I'm just

[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.780]
Drink some orange juice and take care of yourself, but if

[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:37.240]
You know everything will be fine if you drink some orange juice that ain't on my diet. Oh

[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.640]
He rumors

[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.660]
No, I just you know even Aunt Nellie's boarding house never saw so many ugly rumors

[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:50.500]
If this is true about what they did this honey if you know, it's like if it's not absolutely confirmed or is it?

[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.700]
No, what do you mean? No, if Don Cox just there went out on the limb. Oh, yeah, honey was it done?

[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.960]
Well, if that is true, then just about as bad as what they did to

[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:07.180]
To Harry Harrison up in New York City when they fired him the day before Thanksgiving. Yeah, why did Christmas time right before Christmas

[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.460]
We cut for you lose. Yeah, a week before Christmas

[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.800]
What is it with these companies that they can't wait till maybe after the holidays? I mean well wait a minute

[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:19.520]
You of all people you have to ask what is it with this business? Oh my god. Yeah

[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.720]
That's pretty pathetic. This is the worst business. I remember when we were at Windsor was somebody

[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.620]
I don't remember who was got canned on their birthday

[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.000]
That's nice. Yeah, happy birthday by the way you're fired. Yeah, Mary Christmas

[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.660]
By the way, you're fired. Yeah, it's just terrific. I think they liked it. I'm believable

[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:40.240]
Yeah, I think they're a bunch of sadist basically. I think they enjoy it. So what's the story did his contract run out?

[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.700]
You're asking me

[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.640]
When it started the whole damn rumor

[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.800]
Now the truth comes out the man comes on the show starts a rumor and now he admits you didn't know a damn thing

[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.280]
I just heard it from somebody up north that that he was looking around

[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.780]
You know because maybe he got the vibe that he was not going to get picked up

[00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.000]
I don't understand it because he did very well for a long time over there

[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.860]
I mean yeah, they had their ups and downs, but the whole station had their ups and downs. Yeah, but he did he did well

[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.620]
That's he did. I think the first clue is one that what is a channel 69

[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.600]
Quick carrying the morning show about a week ago. Oh

[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.920]
Yeah, I know that

[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.640]
Well, I'm sure that there were least least 15 20 people watching

[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:18.620]
Yeah

[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.680]
Well, I was it. I just just

[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.820]
Disgusted by the business once again. Sorry. I had to call up and vent my hostility here

[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.960]
So in other words in other words today you would admit that you're not in the business

[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:30.740]
What?

[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:37.880]
I say today based on the way that you just express yourself you would admit that you are not connected with the business

[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:42.340]
As opposed to last week when you went through this big song at the dance trying to deny it

[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.320]
Well, I own a radio station

[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.960]
Doesn't make any difference. It's up there in a boondocks of Maine somewhere

[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.420]
It's in a city that's not even on the map

[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.900]
It's a huge radio station. Yeah

[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.060]
Big is this room right as big as this studio

[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.980]
Hey, it's a start everybody's gonna start somewhere. That is correct. Well, it's nice to own your own station

[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.960]
Well, I'm checking it out with amacosey what I can do

[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:12.340]
All right, well if I don't talk to you happy holiday while the same to you happy happy man everybody's happy

[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:16.920]
Everybody's ready to blow their brains out. I sure hope they don't make you work on Monday. That would be rude

[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:24.280]
They don't understand they've already told us you'll land a student the window and she lifted her arm in the Italian salute instead

[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.820]
You guys are working Monday, okay? Is that the same you're the used to be the music director years ago

[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:36.660]
She's been here for 28 years. Okay, that's right. He has been everything and like I said the only thing she hasn't done is her own show

[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.040]
And next Monday great data start man

[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:46.520]
You'll land a parapar show and to a w i o d Monday only that's incredible. She's been there that long yeah

[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:53.800]
Yeah, well, there's no rest for the wicked. Okay, but I did find out during the last a few traumatic minutes that they are gonna

[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.960]
Squeeze me into that production room one night this week. Yes, we're not exactly sure when yet

[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.160]
But they're gonna give me a couple hours of their valuable time and I'm gonna get to do this thing

[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160]
Did he bring the I'm this thing over with you?

[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.720]
Yeah, because when when these things happen like what happened to sunny

[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.560]
I just think of what I must did on oh no, we don't have that where he's talking about Harry Harrison

[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:16.580]
Yeah, we had no no we didn't bring that over and we still are waiting for freeway and spigot by the way

[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.520]
Yeah, I saw mine

[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.600]
What does that mean although that's where you said they don't have it anymore? Yeah

[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.000]
God love to hear it. I mean, you know you said how great it is. I've never heard it

[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.300]
Yeah, well somebody in the I'm sure somebody in this audience has got it. Okay, the only problem is now opening up a tape

[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:37.380]
Oh, man, you don't know what's in these if you could see the mail here today you would pass out on the floor

[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:42.300]
I mean, it's mind-boggling. I should be down there helping you out with this stuff. Exactly. Yeah, what the hell are you doing?

[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.780]
Last in a Christmas shopping. Yeah, you don't like me story. No, you know what's irritating? What's irritating?

[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.640]
These people advertise things to stay all in these flyers

[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.780]
And then you go to the store and they don't have it by the way when's the last time you got on Delta?

[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:02.280]
Oh, I now I disagree with you. I like Delta. Well good luck to you. Okay. I always knew there was something in your past

[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.620]
Personality that I didn't like too much. Okay. Well, I can't agree with you on everything

[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:11.760]
I've had bad experiences with Eastern. I've never had a bad experience with Eastern Eastern to me has been as close to perfect

[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.620]
in fact when I went to Hawaii

[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:20.300]
I flew the first time I'm talking about this is about four or five years ago and I flew the first part to Denver

[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.040]
Don't ever fly at a Denver man on Delta because Denver that airport is like

[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:29.380]
It's impossible. They're like they're loading ten different planes at the same time at the same gate, you know

[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.280]
I mean, it's in it's so congested. It's brutal.

[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:38.600]
sat on the ground an hour and a half on one plane got put on another plane sat in the ground an hour and a half

[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.200]
That one had another technical malfunction

[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.880]
They finally put us on a third plane on a different airline to Ontario, California

[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.880]
Bus does to Los Angeles put us up in a flea bag hotel overnight

[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:54.200]
And then the next day I got on Eastern for the last leg of my trip to Hawaii and it was it was paradise man

[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.480]
And the food was even great. It was like a whole different experience

[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.060]
Yeah, I had one bad experience with the Eastern but I've never had a bad experience with Delta

[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.780]
So I don't know yeah, well those are the two times you flew I guess

[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:09.180]
No, I fly a lot and I always take Delta if I get a chance but you know, you just got unlucky with them

[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:13.500]
Yeah several several times. I mean just a succession of bad luck

[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:20.560]
Remember people look for a bird of paradise lands on their wing. Do you remember people express? Yeah, that was that was a classic airline

[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:26.980]
Haha, assed tens. Yeah, well listen. It's been real uplifting talking to the odd. Ha ha ha

[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.060]
Well, I think it's depressing. I mean I can't believe that they would do that Tillma week before Christmas

[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.840]
Well believe it no

[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.320]
Mary Christmas everybody. Oh hey. Oh, oh, oh

[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:42.220]
Hi, so 1124 WIOD you're happiness stationed for the holiday season and we'll be right back

Boy what a day huh what a day

[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.940]
Soon as Roger said that when we came in we should turn right around and walked out and we didn't pay any attention to him

[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:28.340]
Let's try this mobile in Broward this ought to be real interesting hello. Yeah, I've been holding up for 24 minutes

[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.540]
Well, why don't you let go sir the blood circulate a lot better

[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:37.440]
Oh, if I let go I don't know I never find it again. By the way hi bird he's talking about the steering wheel of course

[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.680]
I don't want to have the road

[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:45.780]
Neil I don't want to get this guy in for a lottery a lot of said who sent us his letter postmarked Miami by the way go ahead sir

[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:54.340]
Listen I drive for UPS and Sunday I was not excuse me that or that or the I was driving up from Miami to Orlando

[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:58.240]
That's my route. Yeah, and I happened to turn to an into WJNO

[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.240]
Huh and there was this guy sitting in for Lee's bowler's name is

[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.360]
His name is Jeff Charles. Yeah, we saw that in the paper today actually made the newspaper and that exciting

[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:14.920]
Well, I'll tell you what I record it in a tape and I'm mailing to you. He would no sir sir. Don't do it

[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:21.420]
I'm not interested he was ripping you I couldn't care less what he who he rips the problem with Jeff Charles's he didn't have a job

[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:28.820]
That's why he's ripping okay, but the thing that got to me why he filled in for Steve on this station when Steve was away for three days

[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:34.000]
Are you serious and he was supposed to fill in for all three days and after the first day he was not invited to come back

[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.140]
Merry Christmas. He was uninvited back

[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.420]
That should give you a little tip off on Jeff Charles, okay?

[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.920]
Well, and he was ripping the Camilla's house. He said that's a good thing you're doing

[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.780]
But he said those bombs there should have gone and get a job the ones that aren't able to work

[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.260]
I don't I don't want to dignify him by repeating the kind of

[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.880]
Craft of his fuse on the ear, okay? Okay, listen

[00:19:53.880 --> 00:20:00.400]
Did you ever get to see that that Howard Stern tape? Yeah, terrible. Okay, you had a couple of moments

[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:05.680]
But the generally speaking it was pretty howard is great on radio. He's never gonna make it on TV

[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:11.260]
He has been gonna do more TV shows than eight ten people I know put again. It's never gonna happen

[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:17.700]
It's not a TV person. I was last week. I was up in New York. We were visiting our folks up in Rochester and

[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:23.900]
We went down through New York City and we stopped at Macy's and that does at the start of the tape

[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:31.440]
Remember that girl that kind of plays horse the autumn. Yeah, she works there. She's she worked in the cosmetics department

[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.360]
We all got two meter over there great

[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:40.600]
She was signing autographs and all that I guess that that that made her pretty pretty famous there Neil evidently

[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:47.280]
Yeah, so okay, you all take care and nice to see you and nice seeing you. I guess I'll talk to you next your booth

[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.560]
Okay, bye

[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:56.080]
Very very strange. I smell a solder do you yeah, it's not really growing are they world? That's right

[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:01.620]
They're working over there. I it's amazing. I have a second smell and I can sniff that stuff a mile away. I can't

[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:08.040]
Yeah, I spell it now now I know you do you know that I've planted the seeds in your brain you being so

[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:16.680]
You know I wouldn't impressionable. Yeah, right? We have an open line in Broward at five two four W I O D

[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.060]
well

[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.780]
Okay, first I have a little announcement to make ladies and gentlemen and we hope that Bill Mullin in our

[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.860]
W I O D sales department is listening now and

[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.700]
That this might penetrate his ears

[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:40.800]
It seems that the last several days of but last week and then again today I've been promoting enthusiastically and heartily the

[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.500]
Grand opening of the Margate location of char hut

[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:52.120]
Oh, no, it also seems that there was a message from our good friends at char hut and thank God they are good friends

[00:21:53.100 --> 00:22:00.700]
That Mr. Mullin evidently their Mr. Miss placed or a wiped his earlobe with or something happened and the Margate

[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.080]
Grand opening is postponed until January and

[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:12.620]
Then we get that exciting message about the char hut in Margate and Bill Mullins what a day perfect day to get

[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.580]
Bit right busy filming Southern Comfort Part 2 as we speak

[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:25.100]
See that that's what bothers me and I've seen this in a lot of places and this is evidently no exception

[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.840]
When the holidays come

[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.480]
Everybody like drops everything and a lot of a lot of them loose strings

[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:36.580]
You know what I'm talking about a lot of loose ends wind up all over the place and all over the floor

[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.540]
And you wind up stepping on them and stepping on each other because people are more involved in

[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:42.900]
Not working

[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.300]
And all the other chaserae that goes along with this time of the year

[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:51.720]
Then they are in getting their stuff together to compare this. We got a delta story on fine now

[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:56.840]
They're gone. I see what is that all about. I was gonna put them right on at the head of the line and they disappeared

[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:57.920]
mobile

[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.220]
Hello, yeah

[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:10.140]
What do you mean by that? Well, uh right now when you when you when you punched the button

[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.180]
A bunch of static and a delay of a couple seconds

[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.800]
What do you mean a delay of a couple of seconds run and we're on a delay on the radio? What are you talking?

[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.920]
Now you sound fine

[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.880]
I've got a feeling there's something screwed up with this time today

[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.660]
It's getting pretty stinkin ponderous feeling

[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:39.000]
Yeah, people getting cut off and people on here maybe in the phone company or maybe in your place or maybe these old bags

[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.720]
Haha who knows but there's nothing fishy going on

[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.500]
Who's after

[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.600]
Yeah, he says you're wine. I thought he's right. Why is it just now?

[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.220]
I'm not wine. I'm just telling it truth. There's something wrong today. I've been listening to you

[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.860]
Since you got back on a amp and there is something definitely

[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:11.200]
I'm gonna tell you sir. There is no debate. There is something screwy here today. That is for damn sure

[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.660]
And I hope you don't get it called my kid wants to say hello to you

[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.400]
Hi, my laddans. Hello

[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.320]

Don't know what you call you. You have the term Yanta for elderly Jewish lady is that correct sir?

[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.760]
No, Yanta doesn't have to be Jewish. It's a Yiddish expression

[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:07.160]
But Yanta can be anybody who's just a big gossip. Okay, so it would also pertain to the men sure sure

[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:12.500]
I'm standing aligned the other day in the company. Yanti. Yeah, I'm standing aligned in public the other day

[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.160]
I know as usual had my

[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.920]
Weeks supply of food. There was a little guy and back me with his wife both both very silver hair

[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.700]
The lady in front of me was reading one of those national scoundrel rags and just moved up a little bit

[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.280]
And I didn't move up. There was a like a person link between my

[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:33.100]
Cart and the people ahead of us. Well the guy says he says who wanted you move up already

[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:37.880]
You know, and I said well, you know, I pushed my cart, but I didn't move at all. I said you happy with that

[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.820]
He says yeah, he says

[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:45.760]
There's something to the effect of all these people all like these youngsters. We can't stand it. Oh, they should give us our own supermarket

[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:52.880]
Oh god, and I don't even think and you know, I just wanted to get alive any sluts. It's his eyes should have known

[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.600]
He listens to that not see Neil Roger

[00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:02.180]
Terrific. You believe it. Yes, I do say and this is public and you know what he made such a stink about this now

[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:07.160]
The manager heard what was going on. He came over and opened up a special line

[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:11.120]
So this guy can pay for his nights worth of food

[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.420]
Metamusel yeah, yeah, it's doubtfully gonna live through the night to eat the food. That's why you buy the one day at a time

[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:21.580]
So it's incredible and just and passing. I like to say something about the Knollis house

[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.640]
I'm a police officer with Dave County

[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.000]
In many many times over the past couple of years

[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:35.760]
They have always given us the extreme consideration cooperation and we've come across people who have been stranded for one reason another and brother

[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:41.740]
Paul it's then exceptional and I just I played with everybody don't have the hearts and the holidays because they do it to

[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.080]
The home. Yeah, they sure do thanks a lot. Yes, I appreciate it. Good day

[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:50.300]

[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.500]
Yeah, I've been working the last four years. I've worked

[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.200]
Every holiday that there's been a work in a restaurant

[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.840]
And I've worked I've worked Christmas and you're getting pretty sick and tired of it, aren't you, sir?

[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:23.720]
Yeah, very

[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:30.160]
Well, if I were you I'd walk in here you could work today later. Yeah, I'd work while I'd go in here today and tell them to drop dead

[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:36.420]
I don't know. Okay, then you can spend the holidays with us. You can come over here and hang out your spare time

[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.460]
Maybe I have to work, but yeah, well, it's a rough world, sir. There are some people just with no heart

[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.040]
Yeah, right? Yeah

[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.220]
Every holiday. Okay. Well, listen, we'll be looking for you next two Mondays

[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:53.920]
And I know Steve will especially be looking for your company because he is apoplectic about this in fact

[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.860]
I think we may have to take some action

[00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:01.960]
We may have to do something really dire about this and solve the problem, you know, I go on strike

[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:07.160]
Hmm, hmm, hmm. He's upset. Yeah, he is forming at the mouth

[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.980]
I think he may have Nick Navarro do something about this

[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.600]
134 WIO D little news update coming up and we'll come right back

[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.840]

[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.880]
Oh boy, we really needed we needed a good comedian like you today, sir

To brighten up our day. Are we all smart as like you? How the hell are you doing? Oh terrific

[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.320]
Well, I'd like to say hi to the bird

[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.900]
Unbelievable. You're your fabulous bird. Thank you

[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.320]
You gotta send Neil on vacation more off. Okay, that sounds good to me, sir

I'll be happy to start tomorrow. That sounds great. Hey, I'm well

[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.140]
You're not complaining. Are you? No, okay

[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:48.460]
Um

[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.200]
By the way

[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.160]
Right off. I'd like to say I saw the movie

[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:58.500]
What a fabulous movie. Rainman. Rainman. Yeah, it's great

[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.500]
It is tremendous. It's one of the best I've ever seen. Oh unbelievable

[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.900]
Okay, we have a little conference about that log now. Huh? Okay, please let's not do that anymore

[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.140]
Okay, we'll forgive her today. I mean she can make a mistake. She's only human

[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.900]
But we don't do them twice in the same hour where we got all these other ones in there

[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:21.080]
You know what I'm saying? Let's spread them out a little bit. Okay. My mind can only do so many things

[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.700]
Neil go ahead, sir

[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.820]
I'm getting very emotional I'm about ready to have a nervous breakdown right on the air

[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.360]
Don't interrupt me while I'm talking

[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:32.120]
I'm sorry. I mean you don't know. Neither Nick is getting hollered at okay now

[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.580]
They're screaming and getting hysterical. Oh right to the chin. Nick is bleeding

[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.360]
Go ahead

[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.440]
Well, that's your line. I told you I want

[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:45.080]
Oh, it's just that there's some other stuff on the log that nothing belong on this show today

[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.780]
I understand it's a holidays. There's a lot of pressure that wild party the other night

[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.260]
We understand they split some goodies in the you know beverages

[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:57.140]
Go ahead sir. We got a little uh a pipe that is correct. Okay, that's cool. Well the movie. I want to

[00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:05.520]
What is that? Sorry, I started choking on something

[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:06.200]
Um

[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.280]
Up anyway, it's 20 till two. Thank you at W. I. I don't understand you

[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.960]
I mean because I'm not really paying much attention

[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:18.500]
But I'm at least keeping a half an ear open so that you know, well, I am paying attention

[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.020]
You know what I mean the frightening thing

[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:26.260]
Yeah, I've been able to follow all yeah, this is gonna make you feel better. Okay. This call is nuts. Yes. It's from Bell Glade

[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.800]
Hello, good day, sir. Yes, sir. How are you sir great? So

[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:37.340]
When it was you know first of all that until time you came to W. I. D. I'd never heard you before but I enjoy your show very much

[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:41.480]
Thank you very much. I also got an old file report from Oak, Chovy

[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:45.380]
I'm called from Delgoye but I really live in Oak, Chovy. Well, that's your problem. Yeah, I know

[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.640]
Being a whole lot of people

[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.300]
No, the a couple of weeks ago in the

[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.540]
Oak, Chovy news if you can believe even have a newspaper out there

[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:58.500]
There was one of the local residents wrote in to complain about the old parts to come out

[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.820]
He has come down every winter to

[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:03.760]
The patient whatever it is they do yeah

[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:09.760]
Complaining you about this now about the but the biggest thing she was dwelling on was the how slow they drive

[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.260]
Well about two days later because the paper only comes out every three days

[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.880]
Uh, one of them responded and this is just exactly what they said

[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.060]
They said the reason we drive so slow is because we don't see well

[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:27.160]
Yeah, yeah, that's true. That's true like not more than two three feet in front of them and no peripheral vision at all

[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:32.980]
No, it's matter as matter of fact I want to tell you a little story my mother has a lady friend who's about 85

[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.500]
And this woman just went to the

[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:40.620]
driver's license bureau to get her license renewed and she took the eye test and barely passed it

[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:44.640]
And they gave her a full six-year renewals till when she's 91

[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.800]
And this is a woman who has virtually no peripheral vision whatsoever

[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:55.260]
Her night vision is virtually non-existent and she's got a six-year license to go out there and murder anybody she runs into

[00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:03.500]
Oh, the last time I got my license renewed there was a guy I had to have been at least 90 with standing in line in front of me he couldn't read

[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:07.740]
What what he had to read they let him call his wife up and

[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:15.920]
To leave my hand reading the card so they could tell so if he kiddos license renewed and then he went out and got the car to drove away

[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.700]
Oh beautiful

[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:24.140]
Okay, right? Yeah, no, no, not not only in Okachoby sir all over South Florida as part of the Florida syndrome

[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.740]
Oh, really but I just want to let you are I enjoy your show

[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:32.240]
I have to admit the first day the first day you're on Steve Keane show when before you came there

[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:38.060]
I didn't think I was going I didn't think I was going to like you. I thought you were rude and obnoxious and everything and you still are but shows great

[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:42.720]
That's correct. That's that's the idea. Well, listen have a great day up there you two sir. Bye

[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:48.080]
Okay, now Paul Jr. This is your last chance. What are they talking about rude and obnoxious?

[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.700]
Any idea

[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:58.220]
Listen I turn on I would be now before you go ahead since you've been on here so much anyway waiting another moment

[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:03.380]
We'll make any different now see I like having everywhere else I have ever worked doing a talk show

[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:08.960]
I've had my own copy of the log for the hours that I'm on the air right and I see here

[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.840]
They don't do that they don't give you the copy of the pages because they want you to be like the prisoner of

[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.380]
Roger and Nick in there so that they can manipulate

[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:19.480]
I like to be able to look ahead. I don't like surprises. Okay

[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.420]
Like that one

[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:26.040]
That one hotel chain that's a no surprises. I don't like surprises

[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:33.100]
So I like to be able to look at the whole log and see how it's laid out and whether maybe there might be something to be changed around as opposed to coming

[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.400]
To like a dead end, you know what I mean? Like that road that Zeta's on to they turn the corner on a dead end street

[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:45.240]
And then finding that it's too late to do anything like a Cornelius brothers and sister Rose said it's too late to turn back now

[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.380]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.280]
Yeah, it is a good song

[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:54.620]
Anyway, well, it's kind of like and it's not the Cornelius brothers. It's Cornelius brothers

[00:33:54.620 --> 00:34:01.180]
Right, but everybody know that no they don't huh. I hear these idiot jock saying oh here are the Cornelius brothers

[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:08.100]
There are no Cornelius brothers and if there are any Cornelius brothers, they're not on that record

[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:10.660]
Speaking of idiots. Yes

[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.300]
The Smollion I called I turned into

[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:19.400]
Reniri to listen to Shulis. Come on now. Don't do that when you cut it. I'm gonna hang up on your

[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:26.520]
Listen listen listen. No, it's nothing to do with Reniri. I call to listen to Shulis show this morning and guess who called to give the time in the weather

[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.320]
Soon as I flick the channel on it with Ed

[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:31.740]
Reniri was talking to Ed

[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.720]
Is that something newer that's something that goes on all the time good day?

[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:40.560]
I

[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.020]
Don't know

[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:45.540]
Listen, it's not something new. Ed has been calling lately. He calls Reniri all the time

[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.640]
There's nobody else's it's a crazy enough to put them on

[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:52.460]
In fact, I heard this morning a lot you know you hear Mike on there and you hear Gil Seagull

[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:57.660]
I don't know where Reniri story is but the sunny better get back from Gainesville and Hawaii. I started that right now

[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.280]
Friday we're talking about that witch at the Tobus

[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:07.320]
No, I didn't say she was a witch. Well whatever. No, she's not a witch at all. She's just not interested in doing her job

[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.600]
She's interested in being a Yento. I think Yento would be a better word than witch

[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.600]
She had her back to me Friday the same day. She had the cards like she had playing cards exactly

[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:21.640]
She wouldn't let him go. You know, I try to get through there as fast as I can and though she would not let it go

[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:26.740]
I drove through it. It slipped out of my hand. She is not in the least that interested in giving you that toll card

[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:34.400]
She's having a conversation with a young lady that works on the other side and they're talking about their personal lives and their dates and this and that and they're just

[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.080]
Carrying a hot going to try to come out nonsense

[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:42.200]
Yeah, and she and doing her job and I wish somebody would tell her at least at least make it look good at least face toward the traffic

[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.780]
So it looked like she's somewhat interested in giving the cards out

[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:49.820]
Well, they got an interesting they got a new guy working there. His name is Doug Rayboard. He's working the second booth

[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:55.660]
You may want to take a look at him. Oh now come on you what are you doing that for what do you mean? I may want to take a look at

[00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:01.100]
Well, he listens he listens to what about it. Why do I want to take a look at he's at least nice

[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:02.900]
President

[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:06.740]
Good day

[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:15.720]
And I thought that was going to be an improvement me too. Oh really he's he's out of control. He really is now

[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.860]
He needs to be rested. He does he's got to be sent to the bullpen

[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:24.360]
And rest for at least at least till after the new year. Yeah, okay. What is the day today the 19th? Yeah

[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:28.300]
No more Paul till after the new year you got to be a aired out being called ordinary

[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:35.220]
I don't care who he calls, but not this show. Okay, you can call Jeff Charles for like here good. We can call Jeff

[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.740]
