ponytail sit on a four-year-old

[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.560]
this is because this outfit is so glad to in cheap now people say well they're

[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.520]
paying you all that money in her pan the hank big bucks let me just tell you

[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.960]
this okay this show more than pays for itself if they ever get the rest of the

[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.200]
spot school in which i don't

[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.640]
but at any rate uh... this show is going to make them a lot of money and they know

[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.660]
that so the fact that they're paying me money that's beside the point because it's

[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.620]
coming back and then some

[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.980]

said how about like the uh... monitors there the uh... cannot be overhead is

[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.660]
that working better now but how about the waste baskets now we're talking we

[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:58.380]
have here at wqa m two waste baskets the size of your thumbnail seriously

[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.920]
algolds thing is got a bigger back up than these uh... waste baskets that's not

[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.940]
even a contest in fact we each one of these could be one of our cheeks

[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.680]
this is the best we can do and then come to find out this is from the janitor

[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.600]
we felt sorry for us because we've been using cardboard boxes since we've been

[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.280]
working in the last few weeks and now we got waste baskets the size of your

[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.660]
anus i mean just uh... unbelievable and ponytails jeth Cohen buys us because

[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.260]
they do a lot around here was supposed to have a tv with the via with the

[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.340]
direct with a uh... dc s system in a whole bit

[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.680]
and of course we don't have that less it's an invisible one so we'd have like a

[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.840]
little bit of contact i tried to explain to these people that they don't understand

[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.980]
sitting in a room with a microphone is not being a radio station the audience

[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.500]
would have a little bit more confidence in tuning in if they felt that we had

[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.200]
some of you know having a window here so we can see the old parts over there

[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.320]
that's nice but if we had a little contact with the outside world so when they

[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.840]
start dropping nuclear weapons when the illegal aliens and all those new baseball

[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.380]
players are coming in from the pahamas that we might be able to see them step on

[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.140]
sure no that something was going on outside as opposed to just being in a

[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.260]
vacuum here but we don't want to get carried away so what kind of some

[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.040]

might have if someone had ever actually heard it Peter Paul and Martin

[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:27.340]
Peter Paul and Marley every song strikes a chord every song warms the heart

[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.000]
and every song contains the words jaw and Irish

[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.400]
and

[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:31.580]
the

[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.180]

he goes up and smoke

[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.600]
you know my topic today is a are we ever going to teach black people to speak

[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.380]
English I was going home from here on Friday and you know the turnpike the

[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.040]
best way by the way George although you don't I don't know which way you go

[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.920]
home you don't you I take county life oh but anyway instead of going back by

[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.620]
pp park which I don't like that whole because it reminds me of my accident

[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.820]
brings back bad memories I do come in that way in the morning but going home if

[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.240]
you just go for 41 to county line road to the turnpike right by the track

[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.360]
isn't there an exit there also getting off the stadium I don't want to get

[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.080]
off with this stadium if you pardon the expression but anyway that's the best way

[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.600]
so anyway I go through there I put my 50 cents in the thing and there's a couple

[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.460]
dark-complexed young guys who are standing there obviously work for the

[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.480]
state for the attorney pike authority whatever they do at least I think they

[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.920]
do where they stole those raincoats but anyway they're standing there and you

[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.800]
know I'm rolling down my window to put the 50 cents of two coins in the

[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.960]
bet box and I can hear their conversation and I thought huh what a run-up

[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:45.780]
I'm making no no these were not Jamaican oh they were American

[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:50.820]
dark-complexed people these were not Haitian are completely American these

[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.160]
were American very dark-complexed people who know speak in English see

[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.320]
everybody's always at the risk of sounding like I want to ingratiate the

[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.680]
specs everybody's always screaming about the old Julio's the done speaking

[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.520]
English I got news for at least the young Julio's speak English English is

[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.200]
my second except for Anna squeak who still hasn't learned after 30 years but I

[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.100]
mean this is not a joke this is not a joke and my question today is how is it

[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.260]
this a bonnix thing I mean we made a good joke out of that we had fun with that

[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.840]
because it's laughable at best and pathetic at worst they used to call it in

[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.900]
Florida when I first came here a hundred years ago they called it social

[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.800]
promotion and I said what's that and they said oh it's because we got some

[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.640]
people who just can't learn anything so instead of having to be 30 years old

[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.340]
and still be in third grade we keep moving them along because then they keep up

[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.840]
with their peers and of course supposedly they got rid of that well guess

[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.200]
what there ain't no way there do not be no way that that be gone because there

[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.580]
are people who cannot I'm not talking about things like let me ask you a

[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.100]
question which of course we all know is grammatically incorrect and very

[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.640]
embarrassing and even some of the Julio's now is there I told you I called my

[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:58.260]
doc yes yes he gives me a frown mr. uptight speak they must be Puerto Rican some

[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.080]
of the weekends are now talking like well some of the darkened by the way

[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.840]
speaking of dark complexion how about that it'll do Kay he'll do spag now his

[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.540]
agents got him over there in the Bahamas waiting for a better deal he's to have

[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.700]
lots of slaves in Cuba waiting for a better deal and of course comes to find out

[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.680]
that these other five people that he's trying to get visas for and master cards

[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:19.460]
one of them is an outfielder all right yeah that's the whole integration system

[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.560]
now okay all you poor Haitian backbids and everybody else that's been waiting

[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.080]
on and the people like from the various countries in Europe who've been waiting

[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.160]
online for like the last 75 years to get a green card in a visa and maybe we

[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.380]
might be nice and luck to let you in but if you can heave the ball baby if you

[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:37.060]
can throw it if you can sling it if you can hit it I almost peed my pants when I

[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:41.580]
heard that one of the other guys is an outfielder so from now on when we

[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.660]
get you know these little uh... wickety boats with a Haitian that come up on

[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.820]
sure the first question is gonna be when they come up on sure when they get

[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.520]
them the coast guard anybody here picture hit they're not going to say anybody

[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.300]

[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:43.780]
fascinated enough to call the show I just have no life yeah maybe you have a

[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.620]
a reason for for why everyone's so enthralled with you maybe they like to

[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:53.080]
other people complain yeah maybe they like it like it like it is like like

[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.960]
having an opinion to question what you want me to talk about I'm not gonna

[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.660]
talk about stuff that's of interest to you what is audience in the hemorrhoids

[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.660]
deeply okay this audience is big on hemorrhoids unfortunately I understand

[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.700]
this is bad fact have you ever had hemorrhoids no no what the hell do you know

Appalachian West Virginia their language is just as bad as any other race of

[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.660]
people yeah it just depends on your educational background that's why that's

[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.440]
what I just got your same little while ago when I was talking about that your

[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.140]
educational background but let me ask you something how come the people the the

[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.260]
white people in South Florida who go to the same schools that the black people

[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:55.080]
go to how come they speak English most of them they may not be rocket scientists

[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.080]
and how come they speak proper English and an awful lot of the black people keep

[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.360]
moving ahead one grade do another and then another and they can't speak English

[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.460]
what is it let me tell you that they're black that are 10 same school that

[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:09.160]
speak English just as well they are white that are 10 the same school it's

[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:14.440]
important you know that you can't say certain race of people speaking English

[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.480]
any worse than another race here I can because it's true you're in denial sir

[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.900]

to one other until I can speak properly let me say this nice circle wouldn't you

[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.400]

Clinton to find me just order the hell they think they are all I was trying to do

[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.960]
with deal with the reality of sex and teenagers maybe if Jesse Holmes had

[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.280]
busted chip or new gang rich had butters the corner a little more it wouldn't be

[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.100]
so uptight slogging the dog never heard anybody and if people did a little

[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:30.400]
more of it we might say some lives hell of Clinton just stayed home and spanked

[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.120]
the monkey he'd even been less hot water teaching kids about masturbation would be

[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.980]
no big deal we could even take some standard teaching tools and just twist them

[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:45.940]
around a little bit like see dick run when you see dick run get to the doctor

[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.980]
because you picked up a bad case of Crouch Crickets folks we got to get

[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:54.480]

[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:09.540]
doll wax the carrot or tickle the taco we'd all be better off and that's all I

[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.780]

[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:10.040]

that cannot talk good English or proper English and blacks yeah trust me well

[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.980]

have a great day and I'll see on the Jerry Springer show this is sports radio

[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.280]
560 Q a l

[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.880]
yes that we had a very brief conversation and unfortunately should have

[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.820]
gone on a hell of a lot longer because I brought up the topic of illiterate

[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:37.320]
black people and why it's part of the whole conspiracy of keeping blacks down in

[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.720]
American society which it is and of course many blacks become very upset about

[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.400]
that there was one very articulate black car who called in and said that we

[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.540]
were generalizing which we were not and we got sidetracked on the whole thing

[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.700]
but I was thinking about it after the show and that is there forget about the

[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.220]
appellates and that I want to hear about all these other places this guy was

[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.800]
bringing into conversation but like we're here in this town if you want to talk

[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.360]
about ethnic minorities Cuban kids I'm talking about Cubans who were born in this

[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.800]
country they go to the same school they take English and the other courses and

[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.880]
they speak basically perfect English then they have a little spanglish in

[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.360]
there but they speak English perfectly fluently and they don't say let me ask

[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.820]
you a question black kids born in this country they not kids that were brought

[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:20.640]
over in crates hundreds of years ago black kids born in this country go to the

[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:26.180]
same school and many of them are we generalizing many of them most of them speak

[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.620]
I don't know about most blackies a lot of too many I think it depends on the

[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:34.380]
neighborhood on the hood yo yo yo yo you're the generalizing now mama and

[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:38.560]
I think you're wrong I think that if you get around a bunch of young black

[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:43.600]
guys for example most of them will talk blackies which is not English and if

[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.640]
you speak blackies I mean it's a free country you're you know you're entitled

[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.840]
to do that but you ain't going to be going nowhere unless of course you're one of

[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.660]
those one in ten billion people like in you know seven feet tall and play

[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.900]
back to ball something like that or unless of course you have a visa from

[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.460]
other Clinton administration to come over here that thing the ill-doca thing is

[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:04.360]
the most unacceptable disgrace that I've seen in a long long time and that

[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.280]
all of a sudden it's interesting the way the TV news people who a couple of

[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.660]
days ago all this is the greatest thing we ever saw and ill-doca we've got to

[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.780]
get another picture and hey maybe the marlins won't be so bad after all about

[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:18.940]
this is a disgrace first of all his common law wife his girlfriend who may

[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.640]
be food was his common law wife they're not even married they got the two

[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.380]
kids back to him and Cuba but not being married maybe that explains why the

[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.780]
two of them are back there maybe that's part of the reason and the eight people

[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.900]
who came up on shore and the Bahamas from Cuba they they were ready to turn

[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:35.300]
them around and send them back to deport them like they do all the so-called

[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.160]
illegal aliens but guess what then they find out the last minute that one of

[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.640]
them is a real hot shot picture who happens to be leave on Hernandez's brother

[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:47.400]
ill-doca ill-dochback now all of a sudden the story changes then he can

[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.980]
form them that one of the other five guys in this of the of the five that they

[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:55.140]
want to get visas for and master cards this guy's an outfielder who can really

[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:59.580]
hit that ball so now the U.S. consulate gets involved in their intervening and

[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.040]
yes we're gonna do this and we're gonna do that and we're gonna give you

[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.600]
the visas and uh... he's gonna stay over there in the Bahamas as long as he

[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.800]
wants of course he said it's not the money and his answer that he hasn't set a

[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.620]
dime to leave on hasn't sent him a dime to his family or him or anybody else

[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:16.360]
or had much contact so the whole thing really stinks and reeks but nobody seems

[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:21.020]
to care about that because it's just like the thing with uh... with this clown

[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.180]
with Lawrence Phillips on the dolphins nobody says anything about that either

[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.440]
because as long as you may be able to win us a game we don't care how much of

[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.740]
a criminal you are we don't care if you came in illegally we don't care about

[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:34.560]
nothing this would really bugs me about what the so-called sports fans is they

[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.760]
don't that there is no scruples whatsoever forget about it and these people are

[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.420]
more important than anybody else and of course the other six people or five

[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.940]
people are going to want to go and back to Cuban being persecuted over

[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:50.360]
there and maybe sitting in jails and cast rose jails for years and years

[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.960]
nobody gives a fly and crap about them because they can't throw a goddamn ball

[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.020]
well i'll teach him

[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:58.360]
maybe they learned to play a little ball they might have a hell of china

[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.120]
and chance or cuban's chance or something like that

[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:04.240]
now those Haitians instead of so on up the baseballs that they start learning

[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.060]
to hit and pitch him that we might let a few more them in here no matter how

[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.260]
they're complex that they might be anybody can so a baseball but hitting them

[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.560]
and catching them that's a little bit tougher let's try mimie spring so

[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:19.040]
yeah hello nil yes sir yet nil you can be so wrong with the question of leave on

[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.940]
her name that goes directly against what you stand for the fact is you know

[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:27.580]
that money will make sure thing go i wasn't talking about leave on her name

[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:31.920]
as we're talking about his brother ill do get right right right when you know

[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.460]
i'm sorry i made a mistake with the name uh-huh but first mistake no i apologize

[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:41.500]
but um you know the thing is is that you're the first one that says you know

[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.980]
where's the money what what you know what's the real reason behind it i'm the

[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:49.600]
bad one wait what do you mean the first one that says where is the money no no

[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.580]
i've been screaming for years about overpaid jox illiterate assholes that the

[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:57.520]
public admire jox entertainers celebrities all this a hero worship of of

[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.300]
morons i've been saying that for years please don't try to you know tell me

[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.320]
what my agenda is because you don't know what you're talking about all right not

[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:09.520]
what i say well don't you think that everybody deserves to make as much as

[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.080]
they can what does that have to do with an illegal alien well there are too

[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:17.600]
long there are too long there's one who can pitch and play outfield and when

[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.040]
the one for people who don't have any athletic talent all he has to do only

[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:26.380]
has to do basically yes yes i think that that and so i'm wrong you can don't

[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.560]
that i don't think that's right i don't think it's right that these other

[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:33.300]
first lepers who are on that boat who are going to be deported back to cuban

[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:37.260]
wind up being thrown in jail you think that's okay because this asshole is a

[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.420]
picture with his wife and his two little kids that he left back in cuba with

[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.760]
his common law wife you think that's something we should admire and then he

[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.780]
should go out and test the friend of market and see how many millions of dollars

[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.780]
we have a pamphlets you can throw a baseball because if you believe that sir

[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:54.060]
you've got a mental problem no no what what do you believe you said that i was

[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:58.460]
wrong what do i believe what i believe it's morally wrong but the fact is

[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:02.220]
that the laws are set up in a way in which the guy who can pitch the guy who

[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:06.780]
could who could have run certain had a lot of time and had nothing to do with the

[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:11.260]
law the law doesn't say anywhere that we make exceptions i mean can you

[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:15.400]
imagine the congress passing a law that says well this is our immigration policy

[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.460]
all you will legal aliens who don't come in properly we're going to send you back

[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.580]
but if you can pitch a baseball or throw football then we'll let you come in

[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.080]
that's not what the law there is a lot that was not like congress saying what

[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.900]
that he'll do it could come in the country what the law said was any

[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:32.640]
foreigner that's willing to invest a million dollars in the United States

[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:37.160]
automatically get to visa and that is a law passed by congress about four years ago

[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:40.340]
and he'll do it is putting a million bucks on all he has to do is find the contract

[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:44.540]
and he got to put a supermarket down anywhere in town for a million dollars

[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:49.440]
and he he fulfilled the requirement of the law put a supermarket down whatever any kind of

[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.080]
business all he has to invest a million dollars he doesn't have a million dollars he doesn't

[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.420]
have a million cents he doesn't have a pop the pissing what are you talking tomorrow he could

[00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:01.280]
have a contract signed tomorrow he could but you know what he doesn't and the fact is that when he

[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.800]
washed up on the behammy insurers with those other seven people he was just another illegal

[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:10.360]
alien in the eyes of our laws okay sir and you're trying to rationalize it and now you're going

[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.940]
chance right because the guy with I mean this was the early age of television that we had a

[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:02.220]
protection right right right right right she must have brought back some information just when

[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:07.300]
they showed uh do you say it's face on TV you know what you can do if you just get over there on a

[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:12.560]
boat yeah right there was a girl I don't know if you checked it out for like three years she was

[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:17.260]
real sick she's from Cuba but her father was over there she had kidney failure for three years

[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:21.760]
they were trying to get her father over to donate a kidney for three years she had to lose her

[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:27.820]
right but yeah for the for the Hernandez and El Bay's ball and the fact that there is anybody who

[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:32.040]
can don this they're oh yeah this is great when you drop that out the barlands can sign them up

[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:36.280]
uh these these people seriously they're taking up they're taking up space on the face of this

[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:40.720]
planet they should be sent put in a rocket ship and set off to your rain is I hear you all right

[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:45.460]
now have a great day I mean you talk about a mentality and I know I've been screaming about it

[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:49.880]
for and I'm not gonna stop because nobody else talks about this it's unacceptable man it's

[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:55.740]
unfriken acceptable I don't give a crap if he throws the ball 120 goddamn miles an hour okay now

[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.420]
if he can play hockey that's another story then we'll sign them up and the problem is those

[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:03.760]
spicks they don't have no hockey players that's the problem we got all these and the Haitians no

[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.060]
Haitian hockey players thank god like I told you we got no dark even that sport already don't

[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:12.520]
start you know with the only thing we have left it's the only thing we've got left is hockey

[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:17.520]
even sports illustrated here several weeks ago they had a front page story whatever happened to

[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.900]
the white athlete which I was kind of shocked that sports illustrated a kind of snooty a

[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:26.660]
publication like that would have the hootspot and the balls to come up with it and it's true I

[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:30.860]
mean basketball is strictly a black man sport they're like a few token whites left in there

[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:34.420]
because there aren't too many white guys were seven feet tall in the first place football

[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:39.560]
baseball see that Jackie Robinson they let a couple guys in there I mean he never stole a freight

[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:44.100]
chain then all of a sudden you got Larry Dobie and then it's like uh where they all coming from

[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:49.300]
so hockey and then of course there was always golf there was golf which to me is boring I mean

[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:53.800]
I can't begin to tell you if you admit to watching golf on television you should also be put on

[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.300]
the same rocket ship with people that think that El Ducey should be here pitching the baseball

[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.560]
but golf was a white man sport they had one or two along the way to make it look good then this

[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:06.080]
tiger woods comes in I am so sick and tired of hearing about tiger woods is he uh is he uh

[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:11.540]
tie is he black is he this does he tie one on is he a faggot what is his story which a lot of people

[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:16.320]
believe by the way but at least leave us our hockey okay we got that Greer kid on Edmonton we got

[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:24.160]
Grant Führer we got famous Amos there on the caps on the Bruins now we got like maybe a half a

[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:29.580]
dozen that's plenty that's a nice tokenism there okay and then we got that Donald Brashear who's

[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:33.700]
nothing but a ghoul over there in Vancouver that's plenty that's enough for right now and then

[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.700]
of course we keep in this guy calling up calm Brian Murray oh we're gonna bring Kevin we expect

[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:42.400]
we don't need any black gold tenders okay we had polky reddit leave these guys alone okay nice

[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:47.580]
white sport what's wrong with that can't there be a white sport how about tennis since Arthur Ash

[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:51.760]
croaked I mean are there any black tennis players of note that we uh I mean you're a big tennis fan

[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.880]
here's some there's more there's definitely there's definitely more fag tennis players than

[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:00.840]
there are blacks unless the Martinez are retiring again yeah but let me say something for let me

[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:07.540]
say something here South Miami hello yes sir yes sir when is this great uh I was uh

[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.160]
I wanted to say something about uh when are they gonna do something about this guy's that

[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:16.320]
are driving out there without intense weather insurance on those old rags you know that what maybe

[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:22.580]
two hundred dollars you know I mean it it would take a chip but a chip in a in a uniform with a

[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:27.040]
badge and a hidden catch him I saw one of the other it was a chip with the uniform here's a matter

[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:30.700]
of fact right on the corner up here I mean you know and uh what at the point that I want to get

[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:35.520]
a close is that that cops are not exempt there was one this morning that got uh got hit that are

[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.700]
like there as it was uh going on a call or something and yeah four guys in a car and then they took

[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.940]
off you know people said why did they run away I mean they didn't have a dime for some insurance

[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:48.600]
on that wreck yeah and uh I got a Florida pal we can't we can't get our act together in Florida

[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:52.800]
which is a posthumane for everybody telling everybody it's safe and it's wonderful here we're too busy

[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:57.200]
worrying about things like that yeah if the cops are gonna build a new stadium for uh for Wayne

[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:02.840]
Heisenberg if they wanted to do something about their colleague uh or any more of their colleagues

[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.600]
are getting hurt or people out there they could take maybe a half an hour of the

[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.960]
the blue hours they spent on the coffee shop hitting on the waitresses and well they're in

[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:14.580]
the try to spot this car and everything stop them well how insurance just start away traffic

[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:18.380]
enforcement in this state is a joke anyway you know this we were talking about this a couple of

[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:25.160]
days ago that people now make left turns on on green arrows and then the light changes to red and

[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:30.700]
four five six more cars go this is a new set in top floor that's just started last year or two

[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:36.020]
and it's getting worse and worse I have never in my life seen a cop pull somebody over because

[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:40.280]
they ran a red light at a in the left turn I've never ever seen it happen and you see all these

[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:45.420]
people making these cop is never around when people are doing all these irrational things we got no

[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:50.040]
real inspection system in this state we got 85 year old people getting six year renewal licenses

[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:55.440]
in the mail people that can't see people that can't hear people that can't walk people that are like

[00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:00.780]
mentally in la la land getting licenses in the mail renewal for six years who are 90 years old

[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:04.980]
and in the meantime they're sitting on hi this road up there by me under the tree with their

[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:08.820]
radar guns out just like they were on honeyhill road this morning I'm coming to work and they're

[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:12.320]
sitting there with their radar guns right under the above and there by the stadium right under the

[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.100]
bridge they're more concerned about sitting there with a radar gun all day they don't

[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:20.180]
they don't want to pull out that's not that's not the individual a porker out there those who that

[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:24.800]
that's that's the mentality of law enforcement in this state that's the powers that be is writing

[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.700]
what what gets me that this guy that don't have any insurance and they have those old

[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:33.080]
dilapidated old heat you know yeah they are the one the worst of funds is your God forbid we

[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:37.260]
should have a real inspection system in the state of Florida palace a little inconvenience so if

[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:42.460]
you got ball tires and no breaks war power to you welcome to Florida I tell you I was driving

[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:47.980]
south from from my name is lakes and it was the road was rainy was wet and there was this guy

[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:53.800]
he if there was I mean he was there okay getting it's one thing but this guy if there was a fly

[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:58.800]
between my bumper and his it would have got squashed and he was the hunk in the horn and you know

[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:04.920]
blow and and the him in the lights and everything and I went up to 65 and I said let me get this guy

[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:09.680]
out of my throat but then he got a punch so very careful I just moved up to the right and the guy

[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:14.720]
writes by I mean he punched it and and they was doing like like like you know the middle finger

[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:18.720]
and all that stuff nice that Jesus Christ they they don't like coming out to serve this is the

[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:23.120]
land of house brutality have a great day thank you good luck here oh god I mean that's that's

[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:26.000]
one thing that is never going to change it just keeps getting worse and worse because it's a

[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.620]
real Yahoo mentality law enforcement down here and traffic enforcement you can't complain about it

[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:35.580]
because there is many it's just it's a joke you get to a corner the light the green arrow comes on

[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:40.820]
and couple of cars go and then it turns yellow and a couple of more cars go and now it's turned red

[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:45.680]
now you're ready to come the other way because your light is green well wrong wrong because guess what

[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.260]
here comes another one making the turn here's another one behind that asshole making another turn

[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:54.720]
here's at least three four five I have counted six people because wow you know some of these

[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:59.340]
lights are pretty long 80% of all accidents happen at intersections and I'm going to I'm going to

[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.780]
tell you another one and they just change the light by the way at knob hill and sunrise up in

[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:06.720]
plantation by me and at first I thought it was a little bit inconvenient because there's more of a

[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:11.100]
lag between the green lights depending on whether you're going north or south it's a blessing

[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:16.740]
because I'm going to tell you if you want to get killed if you definitely have a a feeling of

[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:23.280]
suicide in your bone all you have to do is just go to the corner of hiatus that I say knob hill

[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:42.100]
on after a first team and just before hate comes on right you know you sell a lot of things that are

[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:45.800]
like kind of a controversy also you know when I'm listening I like to call into you know challenge

[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:50.120]
some of the things to say just to make sure they don't go on challenge right in the process

[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:54.700]
of listening to them kind of I'm still wandering and waiting like when are you actually going to

[00:51:55.960 --> 00:52:00.580]
interviews we don't do interviews you know you're almost never have guessed this this is my show

[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:04.580]
what do you bring something at the table what I bring to the table is the the Elijah show we give

[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:08.980]
people a few labs a little bit of provocation but I mean why do I want to be the same as everybody

[00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:13.180]
else's damn show why would I want to do that well actually taking from a different perspective you

[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:18.060]
wouldn't necessarily have sports guests you know but see now here's another you're a new listener

[00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:22.580]
right and already this is the fifth or six day I'm on this station and here's another guy that's

[00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:27.420]
programming the show for me you know that programming you are I don't want what what guests will

[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:31.740]
you like me to have on I used to have guests on I used to do topics for years in this town and was

[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:35.900]
number one in doing that and you know something it was as boring as smelling paint it was it was

[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:39.380]
worse than that well I'm not boring as eating vanilla ice cream I'm not saying you have to have

[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:43.480]
national what would you like to hear I'm not saying you have to have national you know but yeah well

[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:46.660]
I make it even worse because in this town if you think there's interesting people interviewing

[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:50.900]
this town give me a hundred names immediately come on let's hear them that's sure you got it

[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:20.560]

[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:50.240]
you could take listen if you want to make some serious money you can take it to the bank right

[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:55.120]
now those people that you just mentioned will never ever be on the show let me just say this the

[00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:00.940]
call of the call before any was kind of I don't know and some here or something but he brought up a

[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:04.800]
good point I have been listening to you but you never really made it clear to your audience in

[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.300]
terms of what your format what well of course if you listen to the show you find out it's just a free

[00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:15.900]
wheeling we just we just do it it's it's what it is it's not a format okay I will be one of these

[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:20.500]

[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:43.380]
town it can't defend himself he tends to be because he's you know he he works for the organis

[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:49.060]
organization and every it's easy to kiss ass and it's also easy to knock somebody when they're not

[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.320]
around and then have them on a show for an interview and kiss their ass when they're right in front of

[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:58.540]
minute semblance of a life call any radio show and express their dislike for it instead of just

[00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:02.780]
reaching over and selecting any of the other six million choices that they might have or going

[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:06.920]
and playing my junk or playing with themselves or doing whatever they wanted to do I mean we're

[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:12.680]
talking about people with very very very serious life deficiencies people who are life challenged

[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:18.860]
here's North Miami hello hi Neil welcome back in the air thank you sir I I agree that clear

[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:23.560]
challenge communications puts back some of the shame yeah now I could you please could you play

[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:30.020]
that phone call from Phil Henry you had last last year about what about him being in Los Angeles oh

[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:36.020]
yeah okay it's coming right up you know six years ago George we had a really great call from

[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:40.200]
Moishi Puppet can we get that on right away okay pal just hang in there sure that from the

[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:48.460]
social aspect oh oh the we miss Bill Henry man do we miss him we had a thing going on at station

[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:52.700]
all we need to was a real morning show I'm sorry I mean I'm sorry suds all we need to

[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:56.400]
was a dynamic if we'd have had Bob and Tom in the morning on it can you imagine George listen

[00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:00.460]
to me for one second it'd be a first if we would have had Bob and Tom in the morning who are now

[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:05.340]
becoming syndicated and Phil in the afternoon could you imagine we would have had double digit

[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:10.020]
shares even in fact boy would have been able to sell low shows but thank God we got this

[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:15.160]
sales department here well you were right about them you were right about these guys you know you

[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:19.520]
meet them in the beginning before I started here they all seem very nice and like very pleasant

[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:23.920]
people and very friendly and very happy to have me here and now we've only been here a week and

[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:28.340]
I'm realizing that this is like makes everything in the past pale and the wind significance I mean

[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:33.720]
clueless and shoeless they haven't got any concept of what copy is about of what any of it is about

[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:37.480]
much less selling any spot you wouldn't want to buy those spots would you and I didn't think so

[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:42.520]
have an ice day though oh my god they're gonna take us back in those days of yesterday year when

[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:46.820]
you know when QAM had those point two I mean we might have big numbers but we'd be selling it like

[00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:53.500]
those days for Neil Rogers show sports radio live 60s QAM

[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.300]
so

[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:28.660]
it's an household celebration and they're all out on the street see them on the sidewalk

[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:38.080]
over here them shuffling feet 20,000 apples and an apple from the maze to keep aside good people

[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:40.280]
there's the half old great

[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:59.260]
We've got the asshole freedom, the asshole fun, asshole for Jesus, the asshole for guns,

[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:09.060]
asshole for justice, asshole for crimes, asshole for asshole, asshole for all crimes.

[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:27.960]
We've got assholes making money, we're making all the rules, making all our jobs and everything that's hard to do.

[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:37.280]
Half-hole's not on the water, half-hole's the sky, and he's not accepting help on it, and the asshole is even blind.

[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:58.340]
I'm not a real man to trade, my head's not black, my head's not black, my head's not just another asshole on the grave.

[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:14.820]
I'm not a real man to trade, my head's not black, my head's not black, my head's not black, my head's not black, my head's not black.

[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:29.040]
I told him to give me orders and I told him to throw the boat.

[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.580]
I told him to get elected because I told him to throw.

[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:38.500]
I once heard his gun and all that told him to have a die.

[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:42.900]
They just lay in bed in the morning light.

[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:47.760]
And so come morning, and so come day.

[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.100]
And so come day, and so come day, and so come day.

[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.980]
For me, thousand and so come day.

[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.920]
The fascist people in the household are crazy.

[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.240]
I should have been on much of beef this morning.

[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:18.960]
That would have been good.

[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.700]
Boy, do I have a few beef today, baby?

[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.760]
We don't want to get started on a negative note.

[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:29.320]
Oh, man, just in the last 24 hours, I got enough beef to fill up a goddamn encyclopedia.

[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:33.400]
By the way, Erica, you're another one of my beefs, the last color on the worst team this morning

[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.280]
with her beef being me, which is fine.

[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.320]
I mean, if you don't like the show, you got a lot of company.

[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.160]
There's plenty of people.

[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:38.680]
Don't like it.

[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:39.360]
Can't handle it.

[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:40.580]
Emotional cripples.

[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.180]
But guess what, sweetheart?

[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:43.560]
This is in the sports show.

[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:44.480]
It never was.

[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.600]
And it's never going to be.

[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.600]
And I told you that the very first self same day.

[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:48.420]
And guess what?

[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.220]
It's also not a sports station anymore.

[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:51.820]
They haven't figured that out yet.

[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.360]
And some of the promos and whatever.

[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.120]
But it's not a sports that all sports.

[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:59.680]
It's mostly sports as in 20 out of 24 hours, which is five,

[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:02.360]
six, which is a hell of a lot, 80 over 80%.

[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.200]
What is that?

[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.540]
83% something like that?

[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:05.300]
Who knows?

[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:08.600]
And more than enough, trust me when I tell you more than enough.

[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:11.320]
Believe me when I, especially in this market,

[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.980]
much more than enough.

[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:15.380]
So, Erica, I hate to break the news to you, sweetheart.

[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.840]
But before you start squeezing your philosophy back too tight,

[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:20.320]
don't get all bent out of shape because I didn't come here like

[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.160]
on a wing in a prayer begging on my knees for a job.

[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:25.700]
They hired me to come here and do the near-order show.

[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:27.840]
Absolutely not a sports show.

[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:31.820]
Because sports, I know this may come as a real shock to you, sweetheart.

[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:35.040]
But it only appeals like on a steady diet of it.

[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:37.440]
To a very narrow number of people out there.

[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.300]
To a narrow segment, especially in this town,

[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:41.720]
which is basically as far as sports and most other things

[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.520]
concerned for running phonies.

[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.820]
Erica, but have a nice life, sweetheart.

[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:47.880]
But at any rate, yeah, don't see.

[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.200]
I did hear early in Mandage.

[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:50.400]
In fact, we were still in here.

[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.160]
I was in this room.

[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.220]
And I heard another one of the emotional cripples.

[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.480]
You know, for all these macho, including the women out there,

[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.840]
these dikes who are big in the sports,

[01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:59.640]
all these macho people that allegedly are listening to this station,

[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:01.100]
we got more emotional cripples.

[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:02.200]
It's terrifying to me.

[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.540]
First, it's the language.

[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.600]
Oh, it's so crudely so disgusting.

[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:07.040]
You know, they're offended.

[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:09.180]
They can't turn it off and they're still listening right now.

[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.040]
Every damn one of them, but they're offended.

[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.160]
That's number one.

[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:15.380]
And number two, this emotional cripple that caused yesterday.

[01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.480]
And Mandage was going on about he's been out of town.

[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:19.080]
And who's Neil been ripping?

[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.000]
And what has he been saying?

[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.900]
And the guy calls and says, wow, you know,

[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.120]
he reprinses Diana.

[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.220]
I thought this guy was going to break into tears.

[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:27.780]
And Mandage said, well, I can easily understand that,

[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:28.660]
especially with the, you know,

[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.880]
they're selling tickets to go see her grave site and stuff.

[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.220]
And the guy says, yeah, but you did a lot for the poor.

[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.900]
I mean, doesn't, I know you don't want to think about this.

[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:36.880]
Folks, it is a downer.

[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.580]
I don't want to be a downer real early in the morning.

[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:41.860]
We try to have a few laughs here, but I do try to force some people

[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:43.400]
to take a look at reality.

[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.360]
It did not for too long because it's an ugly thing.

[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.480]
And then just let's go back and have a few or y'all.

[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:48.400]
Exactly.

[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:51.860]
But I mean, doesn't it terrify you that there are so many people

[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:53.500]
with that same idiotic mentality?

[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.960]
She did a lot for the poor mother Teresa,

[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.980]
for whom I had no love to say the very best,

[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:01.740]
but nevertheless, that wrinkled up old prune bitch,

[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:05.400]
nevertheless mother Teresa allegedly devoted her entire

[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.580]
adult life into helping the poor, the downtrodden,

[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:11.400]
the needy, the desperate, the disease, the what,

[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:13.860]
and mother Teresa died the same weekend as Diana.

[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:15.700]
A couple of days later, as a matter of fact,

[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.700]
all wrinkled up and shriveled up about three feet tall

[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:20.600]
over there in India with all the schleppers,

[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:22.160]
the schleppers and the lepers.

[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:23.860]
And how much time did she get?

[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.020]
Are they paying to go see mother Teresa's grave

[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:28.160]
if she's got one if they didn't just burn the thing

[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.980]
and put it in the throat and the sea somewhere?

[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:32.840]
Nobody gave a flying crap about mother Teresa

[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.760]
because she was a wrinkled up old bag.

[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.180]
Who wasn't a glamorous?

[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:36.800]
Huh?

[01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:38.280]
She wasn't a snappy dresser.

[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.060]
And guess what?

[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.140]
She wasn't being followed by the paparazzi either.

[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.900]
She wasn't, you never saw mother Teresa

[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.340]
on the front of the tabloids.

[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.860]
The acquirer and the globe, the tatler and the star,

[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:49.620]
never had no big inside scoop on mother Teresa.

[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.820]
There were no naked pictures of mother Teresa

[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:53.120]
on a yacht somewhere,

[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:56.320]
sailing with some big Greek or Arab maggot,

[01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.140]
as in the case of Aristotle O'Necess,

[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.820]
or this doobie doobie, whatever's name was,

[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.600]
I mean, get serious already.

[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.100]
Maybe that we're doing a few doobie doobies on the yacht.

[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.120]
Maybe that was the problem or not enough.

[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:10.500]
Is the case maybe, although he was into much more exotic things

[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.520]
that Arab bastard.

[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:14.860]
But at any rate, I mean, is it difficult for you to understand

[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:17.480]
that Diana, Princess of Nothing,

[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.400]
was basically nothing

[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:22.280]
and all of these wonderful charitable things that she did

[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.160]
were scheduled for her?

[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:27.220]
Do you think that Diana really had a great social conscience

[01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:28.580]
about landbinds?

[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:30.560]
Do you think that she was really very concerned

[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.340]
about all the innocent kids and people

[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:34.840]
who are going to get killed by landbinds?

[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.380]
Because the world is a slaughterhouse?

[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.440]
She auctioned off her dresses.

[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:38.100]
Right.

[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.940]
She's just like that spit over there.

[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:41.240]
It's auctioning that's a sell-em-out

[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.640]
all the furniture from that houseboat.

[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:44.000]
Well, he's pocketing that then.

[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:45.060]
How do you know that?

[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:45.840]
You're right.

[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:47.460]
You're right, of course he is.

[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:48.460]
So what's wrong with that?

[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.680]
It's America. It's free enterprise.

[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:50.840]
It's just like Yildouchet.

[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.240]
By the way, great column.

[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:54.080]
And I never read the hero, but it happened to be sitting

[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.760]
outside, it came in here real early this morning.

[01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:58.400]
Carl Heisen, for whom I have the lowest regard,

[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.980]
by the way, so overrated with all of his alligator stories,

[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.660]
but has a great column about the immigration priorities

[01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:05.280]
are worked and right next to it was a big thing.

[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:07.960]
Red carpet for Duque, Duchet, a sore point.

[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:09.860]
So they're finally starting to get the message

[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:11.860]
that this whole thing, and it ties in with what I said

[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.740]
about this idolization of mediocre

[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.980]
and even people who aren't even mediocre,

[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:18.600]
people who are less than mediocre.

[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.600]
Who would you do to lead for the poor?

[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:21.260]
Okay.

[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:23.000]
So does that mean that they had a...

[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.180]
I can understand the British,

[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.900]
and I have no problem at all understanding

[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.680]
that they've always been very silly people,

[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.480]
and they continue to be the silliest people

[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:33.140]
who are desperately locked into this archaic monarchy crap.

[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.900]
They can't escape from it, they're in a trap.

[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:37.140]
No matter how much they would like to escape from it.

[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.960]
So she at least represented them

[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.900]
an almost human part of that monarchy.

[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:43.340]
She was almost somebody they could like,

[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.800]
oh, here's a real person.

[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.480]
But for the rest of the world,

[01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:49.060]
including this idiot that called Mad Dog yesterday,

[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:49.920]
to get all the...

[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.760]
Oh, she did so much for the poor and he's ripin' her.

[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.680]
I wasn't ripin' around ripin' the people

[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:56.520]
that are gettin' all been out of shape like he was.

[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:59.000]
Who gives a flying crap about Diana?

[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.580]
Even Robert Duval,

[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:02.680]
a network wasn't in such a big hurry to talk to her.

[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.460]
I remember, so I'll get back to Diana.

[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.800]
He wasn't in no big hurry to talk to that bitch.

[01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.520]
Why do you people gonna get with it?

[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.440]
Oh, but isn't it gonna be a sports show?

[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:12.600]
Can we hear a little more about the Yukon?

[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.760]
Yeah, I got some sports stuff to talk about.

[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:16.540]
It's called the Big Choke.

[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.160]
He was playing the lando, the pollo para acá.

[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.440]
He was playing the lando.

[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:19.960]
Yes, sir.

[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.000]
I was cooking my breakfast for a second.

[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.140]
Hey, um, we just see the big,

[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:26.060]
big, big, big, big, big...

[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:26.780]
No, I hear you didn't.

[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:30.120]
Hey, you know, let's print the Diana thing.

[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:30.520]
Yeah.

[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:34.620]
You know, people, they're so simplistic and...

[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:35.780]
It shouldn't even have a job.

[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:36.420]
Yeah.

[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:38.280]
What is she supposed to do?

[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:39.700]
Well, she never stole a freight train.

[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:43.060]
Yeah, I bet you she had somebody dish for her in the morning.

[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:43.840]
I mean, she didn't.

[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:45.240]
She also did a lot of puke in too,

[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.760]
which kept her busy throughout her trouble.

[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.180]
It's just unbelievable.

[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.320]
Mother Teresa, you know, you look at all the stuff

[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.480]
she's done through her whole life.

[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:53.260]
Well, supposedly.

[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:55.620]
But I mean, I just use that as an example

[01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:57.000]
because she croaked the same weekend.

[01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:58.860]
And, you know, they gave her 20 seconds.

[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:00.660]
Every couple of hours just as lip service.

[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.040]
Because nobody cared about that.

[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.240]
This business, oh, well, she did all these good things.

[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:07.620]
There are many thousands, maybe millions of people

[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:09.380]
around the world who do far better things

[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:11.100]
than Diana ever dreamed of doing.

[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.700]
And nobody ever hears of them.

[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:14.160]
And no matter how and when they die,

[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:15.500]
there won't be any parade.

[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:17.140]
There won't be any gigantic ceremony.

[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.020]
There won't be anything on CNN or MSNBC

[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:22.920]
or CNBC or any other guy at the end place of the BBC

[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.020]
because it's a pile of horse crap.

[01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:28.220]
And for the American public or anybody else outside of England

[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:31.000]
to get all wrapped up in that and get all weepy and emotional,

[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.260]
there must be something wrong.

[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:33.460]
There is not must be.

[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:35.880]
There is something desperately wrong with the public.

[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:38.420]
I mean, talk about having too much idle time on your hands.

[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:39.840]
Well, you said it better than I could.

[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:40.660]
Have a great day.

[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:40.940]
See you later.

[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:41.560]
I agree.

[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:44.440]
How is it possible for there to be so many stupid people

[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:44.940]
in this world?

[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:46.820]
Wake up with the first key.

[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.280]
Your vote, Jeff DeFarris, is the goal see.

[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.620]
Weep the mornings and six.

[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:54.320]
Only on sports radio 560 QAM.

[01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:58.560]
This is the new Roger show.

[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.280]
This is his brain.

[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.240]
Any questions?

[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:05.520]
Here's a western.

[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:06.060]
Hello.

[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:06.840]
Hello, Neil.

[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:07.360]
Yes, sir.

[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:07.840]
How you doing?

[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:08.240]
Great.

[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.740]
Those gypsies in Italy,

[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:11.260]
and they're the same ones that come over here

[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:12.540]
and steal our wallets in the mall.

[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:13.980]
No, they're different.

[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:14.800]
Different gypsies.

[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:15.920]
But they look...

[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:16.180]
I don't know.

[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:17.200]
Same family.

[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:17.800]
They're all related.

[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:19.000]
No, they are.

[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:22.160]
Yeah, I had one of them try to rent my house one.

[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.380]
He pulled up into Mercedes.

[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:26.060]
He was real smooth talking to like 12 people in the car.

[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.100]
He was just buying all my appliances.

[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:28.960]
I got a little nervous.

[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:29.540]

[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:31.400]
How did you see that?

[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.160]
The guy who shot that guy in the parking lot.

[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.100]
The guy who shot the guy in the parking lot.

[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.360]
The security guard who shot that guy over a parking space.

[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.040]
Oh, that happens here all the time.

[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:41.980]
That's all I'm crazy about.

[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:42.620]
Yeah.

[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:44.680]
Well, you know, on the news,

[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:47.680]
they were talking to all the people in that shopping center.

[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.540]
And they were all saying how this guy was a time bomb.

[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:50.240]
How he was a...

[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.440]
No, this was going to happen.

[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.960]
They're happy he's gone.

[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:54.440]
The next day in the herald,

[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:58.220]
they were talking about this guy like he got the most Christmas gift.

[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:00.160]
He was beloved.

[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:03.160]
There were two different stories with the same thing.

[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:03.560]
Right.

[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.820]
Well, it's just like this Eldouché story.

[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.740]
Within the same newspapers,

[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.360]
there are read all these glowing stories about how wonderful this is.

[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:13.820]
And this liberation of this wonderful guy who's been screwed over over there

[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:17.820]
because his brother implicated a minister thing about the flee in the country.

[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:20.380]
And Yadiyade and got kicked off on national team.

[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:23.600]
And now he's going to come here and live the American dream and make all this money.

[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.700]
And then the same paper, if you turn later on,

[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:28.100]
you'll read the real story about how what a ripoff it is

[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:29.780]
and about how all these other people.

[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:32.520]
Carl Heissens got a story in a column today

[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:36.280]
and toward the end, he talks about a woman in Cuba that he had met.

[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:37.600]
And she's a doctor.

[01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:40.720]
And she specialized in caring for children and the elderly.

[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.860]
And she was given by the Cuban government of salary equivalent

[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:46.560]
to about $5 a month, $5 a month.

[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:47.700]
And he makes the point that she,

[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:48.840]
under no circumstances,

[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:52.080]
would ever be allowed to be come into this country, never be granted a visa.

[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.860]
And if she had been one of those eight people who washed up into Bahamas,

[01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:57.940]
they would send a rascback there and she might have gone to go cash to her jails.

[01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:58.620]
Yeah.

[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:01.280]
So these people, it's this idol,

[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:06.640]
and it's so frustrating to me because most of these jocs are morons.

[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:07.720]
They're scumbags.

[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:08.500]
They're crap.

[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:09.360]
They're crap.

[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:09.920]
They're garbage.

[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:13.240]
Yeah, white feeders and drug addicts and garbage.

[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:16.380]
And yet these people with this joc mentality, like Tyson

[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:18.040]
and like Michael Irving and all these other,

[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.740]
it makes no difference what they do.

[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:23.860]
The joc mentality people, they still admire them and they subsidize them

[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:25.120]
and they pay to support them.

[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:26.640]
There's something wrong here, man.

[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:27.120]
Yeah.

[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.400]
Something very, very wrong.

[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.980]
In fact, they left one guy behind there that I saw in the news

[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:32.340]
and he was even speaking English.

[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:33.460]
He should get in.

[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.360]
There you go.

[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:36.520]
Can I call my wife a douchebag or a bag?

[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:40.080]
Well, he's telling you're a home and garden network love and douchebag.

[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:40.880]
A homo douchebag.

[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:41.900]
Okay, I have a racetail.

[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:42.400]
I'll be with her.

[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.400]
I'll be with her.

[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.080]
Let's go to a key West.

[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:45.340]
Hello.

[01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:46.900]
Yes, Neil.

[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:47.260]
Yes.

[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:49.300]
I'm one of your biggest fans.

[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:53.920]
But why aren't you ripping the assholes on your station?

[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:58.820]
I'm a Phil Henry was much too kind to the X-Jocks.

[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:03.340]
And Jim Mandage has lost his sense of humor.

[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.760]
Jim Mandage is great.

[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.460]
Jim Mandage is God.

[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.360]
No, no, he lost his sense of humor.

[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:09.320]
Jim Mandage is great.

[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:11.640]
Yeah, but he lost his sense of humor

[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:16.220]
and he's become a surly, surby and ethnic cleanser.

[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:20.500]
I think that you should rip all these guys.

[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:23.760]
So, sir, you're another one that's going to call and tell me what I should be saying.

[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:24.300]
Is that it?

[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:24.920]
No, no.

[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.240]
That's what you're doing now.

[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:28.420]
You should rip Mandage and you should rip off.

[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:31.220]
I'm going to tell you in my opinion is I think Mandage is great.

[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.980]
You'll find out for yourself.

[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:33.860]
Okay.

[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:34.680]
I'll find what out?

[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:38.960]
Well, you'll find out that Jim Mandage has lost his sense of humor.

[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:41.340]
Okay, he's become an average ass.

[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.160]
You've turned in child.

[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:45.580]
Wait, don't call him.

[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:46.000]
Check that.

[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:47.020]
You've turned.

[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:47.960]
That's not me.

[01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:49.180]
That's Mandage.

[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:49.840]
You've turned.

[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:51.020]
You've checked ass.

[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:51.740]
Get out of here.

[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:52.840]
You've seen I, old fart.

[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:55.280]
I tell you, I'm not going to talk to these old guys.

[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:56.980]
They all got hearing aids.

[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.160]
Get out of here already.

[01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:58.500]
Will you?

[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:01.100]
Man, oh man, go back to New York.

[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.760]
I'm telling you, the worst drugs,

[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.420]
why did they keep giving them mayor credit?

[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:05.220]
You know, Julianne.

[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.500]
Got nothing to do with Julianne.

[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.520]
They got all the drugs out in New York and they sent him here.

[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.480]
That's why the city's a lot better shaped

[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.480]
now than it used to be.

[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.800]
They got all the swill out of there and they sent it down here,

[01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:14.540]
like this guy.

[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:16.080]
Go back to the Bronx.

[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.580]
Okay, maybe Mickey Maddle will come back from the dead

[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:19.840]
and hit a home run over your head.

[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:20.640]
Get out of here, pal.

[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:21.300]
Get lost.

[01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:24.580]
Maybe Lou Gehrig will come back for one more big one.

[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.280]
For one more consecutive game.

[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:29.300]
For one more being the luckiest man under the earth.

[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:30.780]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:31.040]
Hello.

[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.100]
Yeah, yes, sir.

[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.260]
Thanks for telling the truth about Sunny Bono.

[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:37.320]
I've been sick to death in all this adulation.

[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:38.820]
He's the first class jerk.

[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:40.240]
His only ex-wife here.

[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:40.840]
Right.

[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:41.700]
He hates him so much.

[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:43.760]
He won't even mention his name.

[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:44.060]
Right.

[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.540]
I mean, you know, somebody dies.

[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:47.660]
It's always unfortunate, especially if it's

[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:48.800]
a celebrity of any kind.

[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.980]
I mean, he'd get a little more attention.

[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:51.740]
But to carry on and you will

[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:53.300]
agitate this guy like this guy was,

[01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:55.280]
oh, he was such a great member of Congress.

[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:56.880]
And he was such a great human being.

[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.980]
And of course, such a great pioneer in television

[01:14:58.980 --> 01:14:59.780]
and a great singer.

[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.800]
This guy was mediocre at best.

[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.720]
Well, we ran from there upon spring.

[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.700]
He's the one that led the way on cleaning up

[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:06.800]
the spring break stuff.

[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.040]
They copied it in four-lotter day after him.

[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:09.320]

[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:11.160]
You know, there were a lot of people out of there, right?

[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.280]
There was one great scene I watched on TV

[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:15.820]
in Southern California where they were actually

[01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:17.760]
loading women who were wearing phones.

[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:20.340]
Because he told the cops to arrest any women in phones

[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:23.440]
out on Palm Canyon Drive and Palm Springs during spring break.

[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.640]
Yeah, eight off would have been proud.

[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.080]
They were loading them into Patty wagons.

[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:29.640]
And of course, the guys who are already outnumbered,

[01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:31.960]
the spring break partyers who already outnumbered

[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.020]
the women three to one.

[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.420]
They were angry because more of their women were

[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:36.200]
getting taken away.

[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:37.600]
And they were going to have to end up getting drunk

[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.100]
and doing it with their buddies that night.

[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:39.400]

[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:42.140]
But there's actual police barricades

[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:42.600]
along there.

[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:45.240]
There's a riot situation just about to happen.

[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.780]
And Patty shows up like Marshall Dillon.

[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.520]
And he's knows-to-nose with this angry guy

[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.780]
across the police line right on live TV.

[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:55.760]
And he says, we don't want your kind around here.

[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.720]
Don't you get the message?

[01:15:57.180 --> 01:16:00.400]
And the guy responds, I own this damn hotel.

[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.820]
And it's your cops who are causing the trouble.

[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:03.280]
Beautiful.

[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:06.500]
And I mean, this is just a picture

[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:09.900]
of the angry snarling, right wing Republican crap.

[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.760]
Well, I think it's just the study line up

[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.020]
with a bull-backed daughter, don't you?

[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.820]
Yeah, you know, she's a really good spokesperson.

[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:16.300]
Right.

[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:20.660]
She is the front person now for the media group

[01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:23.320]
that counters stereotypes in the media

[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.880]
and when she comes out and makes a statement.

[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:25.860]
She used to be the rear person

[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:27.140]
that now she's the front person, right?

[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:28.680]
What's ironic about that is-

[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:29.080]
Hashtagity.

[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.000]
She was that little girl that grew up on TV

[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.080]
in front of all of it.

[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:32.460]
That's right.

[01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:35.620]
And I mean, now she is the spokesperson

[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:37.760]
just bringing home the fact that

[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.280]
a people are America's sons and daughters.

[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:44.020]
And wild and crazy talk show hosts too.

[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:44.960]
There you go.

[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:45.580]
That's all right.

[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:46.320]
That's a great day, pal.

[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:46.820]
Thanks a lot, bud.

[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.780]
Yeah, there's a lot of us bags out there.

[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:49.760]
No, not Troy Eggman.

[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.620]
Oh, no, not Steve Young.

[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.340]
Not Tony Zona.

[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:54.740]
And he's daughters.

[01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:00.920]
Well, the Rock and Roll, two Congress.

[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.520]
Two pigs and red randies.

[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:08.540]
We're not to be out on time to get a taste.

[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.200]
You decided to come out and see.

[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:13.660]
You had a group yesterday.

[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:20.360]
Until a tree God is your way.

[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.100]
You!

[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:25.100]

[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:33.960]
The crows have failed.

[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:41.660]
We're not here to see that.

[01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:49.220]
But I've seen things still in there.

[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:52.820]
and

[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:59.860]
at least you got the kennedy's out of our hair against god almighty that probably

[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:03.620]
nobody else watches msnbc so whenever i bring that up and john gibson and all

[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:03.980]
those but

[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.640]
john gets it at least is okay

[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:09.500]
they got some other people on that the network who are so marginal that they're

[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:13.120]
embarrassing at best and they do these real real soft amoric interviews

[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:17.580]
but it's the kennedy's in john vanay and the kennedy's similar and uh... maybe

[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:21.880]
built caused the for well that's over now and just they just take things in a

[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:26.480]
hammer and hammer and even had the hammer never hammered him so much god are

[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:30.940]
they bet on notice the incredible response on that the anabin this uh... there

[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:31.700]
is no response

[01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:35.360]
which means that either everybody agrees with what i said and you know that ninety

[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.220]
nine percent of the people are listening right now and everybody else beside

[01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:43.100]
got wrapped up in that thing and was just that the tears were flowing and the

[01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:46.240]
really believe that this was one of the major events of our time which it was

[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:50.620]
not but there is anybody out there who's got the cahons to want to discuss it

[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:54.920]
debated disagree because uh... you know it's much easier to call up mad dog mad

[01:18:54.920 --> 01:19:00.600]
it's a well sticking on poor Diana and she helped the poor yeah okay here's

[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:05.880]
a pop and oh hello it case by by sign yes sir i welcome you back to reason i was

[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:10.040]
calling uh... i'll pop with you about that and i uh... i thought that uh... she

[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:13.440]
was deserving of everything uh... the funeral on that type of stuff i can

[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:16.980]
understand your point of view but at the same time uh... she was deserving of

[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:20.860]
it based on what i think the british people are people around world south

[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:24.840]
story for that they thought that she was uh... it was a fairytale marriage is

[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.960]
everybody thought it was going to be and then it just wound up that uh... the

[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:31.540]
british hierarchy that excited to freeze her out she didn't sit in and

[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:35.340]
trial she didn't have a lot of people felt sorry for and as she was so young

[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:38.580]
and she was going to change the british monarchy and things like that and

[01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:41.820]
you know anytime somebody on thirty thousand how we can change the british

[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:45.100]
monarchy she was no longer even a part of the they stripped her of her well

[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:47.940]
behind the right she wasn't a part of the world family and more how she

[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:51.900]
can change the model while she was in the eighties in the early nineties while

[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:54.940]
she was still married or they were still together they thought that there was

[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:58.900]
hope that they're gonna bring the british monarchy to the modern era i mean i'm

[01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:03.300]
thirty seven myself but the plan trying to make you is the british monarchy is

[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:06.840]
such an anachronism that it's embarrassing right and like i said before the

[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:09.880]
british i can understand and wailing and carrying on getting all that

[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:12.720]
out of shape because there are a bunch of very silly people anyway who have no

[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:16.220]
concept of what the real world is all about until germany starts dropping bombs

[01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:19.960]
and then they come running for us to bail them out but other than that why would

[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:23.300]
the rest of the world care she was not an important person outside of

[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:23.540]
england

[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:26.000]
uh... the outside of the great british

[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:31.120]
listen what jackie kennedy died who was the wife of a present okay who was

[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.100]
married to a rich or oil maggot

[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:33.900]
ok on axis

[01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:37.500]
it was there any any kind of i mean it was on the news for like thirty seconds

[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:41.280]
did anybody said any tears that anybody carry on today my good man not that i'm

[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.180]
saying she deserved it

[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:45.820]
but the point is she was american okay but what you was part of american

[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:49.500]
history nobody carried on when she croaked okay but let me point this out about

[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:52.940]
jackie on that this is i was way too young to remember this but when she went

[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:56.940]
to friends if i'm not mistaken from what i've seen of the uh... biography shows

[01:20:56.940 --> 01:21:00.360]
on any or whatever she went to france in nineteen sixty two or whatever with the

[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.800]
president the french just all over the yet i know how much you love the french

[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:07.640]
but the thing was that she was a very charming woman she was an elegant looking

[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:10.300]
girl and people were taken by that and that's what happened with that

[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:15.080]
that's my that's my point so she just got through dying she was not at all i

[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:18.340]
mean she wasn't a little back she got a cancer whatever was uh... jackie

[01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:18.740]
kennedy

[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:22.640]
it was there was no anything here and i'm going to tell you you are not old enough

[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:24.620]
but when when president kennedy died

[01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:25.920]
when he was assassinated

[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:29.580]
the the ceremony and the things that took place in this country

[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:33.060]
pale into insignificant it wasn't even close

[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:36.800]
to what went on with this dianna business and it's still going on with selling

[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:41.080]
these dolls and pictures and uh... selling tickets to see her where she's buried

[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:45.660]
right this is this is mass madness is how i feel would say this is insanity

[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:49.740]
i but in the only reason that people got caught up in it because the media

[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:51.880]
uh... the media was there to spin it

[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:55.060]
convinced them that this is a major event all over the world

[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:56.400]
you get away from it

[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.820]
when i you mentioned how it would be a what did how it would have he had a

[01:21:58.820 --> 01:21:59.880]
four television network

[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.500]
nineteen sixty two sixty three when kennedy died

[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:06.020]
there were three major american network there was no global communications or

[01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:06.380]
whatever

[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:09.900]
dianna i mean she traveled all over all but it it just

[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:13.380]
that's how communication is a big difference between ninety seven sixty three

[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:16.720]
i realized that i mean i'm not taking her side i'm not taking your side but

[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:20.680]
you know the thing is that it's the way the world is nowadays what i'm

[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:24.340]
maybe really believe what you just said but let me tell you that when uh... when

[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:29.360]
lehar viazwell was shot and killed by jack ruby i saw it live on a sunday on

[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.540]
nbc television

[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:34.740]
so if you think that the cameras were all there and that the three major networks

[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:37.980]
weren't there forget about the rest of the world in this country they all had

[01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:41.880]
the technical ability to be there and and carry on about it as much as they wanted

[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:45.360]
to but it was nothing like that and i'm going to tell you one of the reasons why

[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:50.360]
because back in the sixties this whole celebrity business was nowhere like it is

[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:53.460]
today we didn't have inside addition we didn't have the all these tabloid

[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:57.420]
newspapers we had nothing that compares to this obsession the sickness in the

[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:00.660]
world today and especially in this country with these celebrities and with

[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:04.480]
athletes it's a madness right well the thing was in the sixties when the

[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.560]
Beatles came about they were the first international

[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:10.520]
liberties whether it was athletics or entertainment or they were the first

[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:13.760]
international celebrities in that open the door you absolutely right and we're

[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.380]
talking about them and the people who are the people's were popular with a

[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:19.980]
bunch of screaming little teenage girls the Beatles weren't the how about

[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:23.680]
john lennon got killed okay that that that the me john lennon was the defining

[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:26.820]
moment of my generation all right but when he got shot and killed in the

[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:30.000]
york did they carry on for weeks and did we have a big state funeral and did

[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.320]
they i don't think so no no but then again Diana even when fricking elvis

[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:37.840]
croaked on the toilet okay right even though we got all the silly women still

[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:41.860]
running to grace land even when the king croaked there wasn't that simmiss

[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:45.580]
going on like that but then again lennon was not in any way she had performed

[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:49.140]
part of government not the Diana was but she was recognized as the princess

[01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:53.660]
person i'm not trying to have nothing to do with government had to do with

[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:57.620]
her celebrity status and the only thing it had to do with you're right about that

[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:01.000]
and and in court with that you should croak tomorrow which might not be a

[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.300]
bad idea if you croak tomorrow i can assure you that there will be no outpouring

[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:09.040]
of emotion carrying on in britain or elsewhere and she was the leader of

[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:13.340]
government right i understand that and in closing yes sir it just

[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:17.740]
astounds me that msnbc which is not i i watch it maybe for the big show

[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:21.820]
half an hour how they can put i'm a sign in the morning absolutely astounds

[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:25.860]
me that they have like watching the dead man try to uh... you know uh...

[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:28.860]
continue doing his career think by now he would have made enough money to go

[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:29.540]
often the

[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:32.820]
well all get another heart transplant or something in the rest of his life but

[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:36.840]
this guy it it's very sad to me because i was a huge i miss and he was a very

[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:40.820]
funny guy right up until he took his absence in the seventies and he came back

[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:44.100]
and went down hill from there i mean i remember what's in the ira 70s but

[01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:45.340]
ndc itself

[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:50.960]
i mean you see it a big line mbc on every night and they have an msnbc time

[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:52.120]
together they were on the

[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:52.420]
one

[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:56.860]
and they know they got basically they got three they've got some other spin-offs

[01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:01.280]
to but they got cnbc they got msnbc in the regular mcc so they got all this time

[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:04.860]
they could be the courty v they have all they have that to have yeah because they

[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:05.240]
have their

[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.400]
i think i'd maybe my g e stock of go up

[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:11.340]
oh god and that's all they do it's like what we do about jambanay ranger what

[01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:14.080]
we do about over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over

[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:19.920]
i thank you bye yeah msnbc could be very enjoyable and could be really great but it's not

[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:22.740]
m

[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.680]
nobody is gone

[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.100]
and share with us

[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:39.180]
the skis kept going back to all the time

[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.620]
for you a chick came through that to a song

[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:54.340]
i guess i lost control and smashed my head

[01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:02.100]
