[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:08.000]
Sports Radio 560 WQAF Miami-Port Waterdale presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.060]
We talk to Neil called 560 560 home free training development or count 560 on yourself

[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.180]
all the opinions of Neil in the guest callers or anyone else on the show

[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.240]
who not necessarily reflect on those new AMB's lead acquisitions

[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.600]
or the easily broadcast from now.

[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.180]
Neil Rogers on Sports Radio 560 QAF, where is now?

[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.400]
And now a public service announcement.

[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.900]
The representative of the IACC, the International Association of Colon Cowboys,

[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.800]
we ask the citizens across America to donate whatever you can to start an alternative club

[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.640]
to the Boyth Gats of America.

[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.840]
But pirates of the Caribbean will give young men an opportunity to experience the fun

[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.400]
and camaraderie of exciting outdoor activities, fudge at sailing, camping,

[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.540]
and my favorite Queenie roasting.

[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.160]
Give them a chance. Give what you can.

[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.440]
Thank you.

[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.160]
Anyway, this is my favorite sales role, John penis.

[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.900]
But anyway, before we talk about the Boyth Gats, I just want to mention,

[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.080]
I want to make an admission on here.

[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.160]
It's best to update because it's a dog days of the summer, it's nobody here anyway.

[00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.540]
When I was young, I did steal a free train.

[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.840]
Okay?

[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.460]
Huh?

[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.880]
Well, what's wrong with that?

[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.400]
I think slowly but surely, we ought to start like fessing up to the really serious things that we've done wrong.

[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.140]
I still, in fact, twice.

[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.600]
I still have a free train.

[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.980]
Not the same free train.

[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.280]
Never make the same mistake twice.

[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.600]
Court strikes, Scouts, gay ban.

[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.740]
I don't know where to start today.

[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.980]
We got that show Griffin thing.

[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.600]
We have 10 or 20 people out there.

[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.260]
Listen to the cast and open the morning by default.

[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.280]
Because the radio stuck on at the spot on the dialer.

[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.680]
They think that I'm still on on Zayden in the morning, something like that.

[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.580]
I want to say so, and isn't it interesting?

[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.280]
Talk about that psychic thing again.

[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.500]
Who did I see downstairs when I walked into this building this morning?

[00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.760]
My favorite psychic,

[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.540]
Griffin from the psychic dyke network.

[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.800]
And I said there were lowly $50 million.

[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.620]
Will you please?

[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.200]
I can't get away from you sweetheart.

[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.060]
Every 30 seconds you're on there.

[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.020]
This woman owns much music.

[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.460]
She's on her current early tweeters.

[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.340]
And lo and behold,

[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.420]
comes to find out that Mr. Ripoff,

[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.900]
I don't want to say Paul Castredova,

[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.440]
ever would rip off anybody's material like mine.

[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.000]
Anyone else is he could get a hold of.

[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.840]
But he's ripping her an ass on the air this morning.

[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.260]
As if he's got some reason to rip anybody an ass about the psychic network.

[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.880]
Wonder where Paul got that?

[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.280]
Ha ha ha.

[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.220]
You know, the rumor is,

[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.900]
I'm going to tell me that when Paul Farts, it smells like somebody else's.

[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.160]
That's the rumor that I've got.

[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.660]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.660]
That's Go Henry's.

[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.040]
That was one of mine.

[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.020]
Seriously, nothing original from this clown.

[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.900]
So evidently they got wind of it on power 96, so to speak.

[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.640]
And she'll grip and be in the tough broad that she is and more power to her.

[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.780]
She called them up on the air this morning.

[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.080]
Maybe we'll have a spy report or two.

[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.660]
Is that one?

[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.760]
No.

[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.940]
No?

[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.260]
We had two spy reports in the building already.

[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.680]
By the way, thank you so much.

[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.480]
Joe already earned his jets off and tickets.

[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.280]
This letter.

[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.260]
This is one of the great letters.

[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.160]
What is this from?

[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.120]
Where is this in?

[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.420]
You all USA today?

[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.980]
No, no.

[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.160]
No, it's from USA today.

[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.920]
It's on the other side.

[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.340]
One of the great letters to the editor ever written.

[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.480]
So anyway, Schwo Griffin calls in to defend herself against the school list of texts.

[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.720]
It says to cast it over.

[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.280]
Oh, so you never, you know, endorsed anything that you don't, uh, aren't, uh, stuck it up to.

[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.800]
What was that?

[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.740]
Someone who didn't know when to shut up.

[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.200]
Oh.

[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.000]
I thought he was a good friend of yours.

[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.280]
Oh, it wasn't remember.

[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.820]
So at any rate, no, no spy reports on that.

[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.200]
Look at that.

[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.520]
I would have.

[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.020]
That would have been one.

[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.240]
Oh, it was a spy report, but they didn't know what he did.

[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.660]
Screaming and screaming.

[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.100]
We're about to blow him up to save.

[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.000]
Please hold.

[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.300]
I would just want to put him on hold anyway.

[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.980]
Screaming in my ear.

[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.920]
Oh, it was probably Paul.

[00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.580]
I can't imagine.

[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.180]
See, I think it goes to sure that either nobody is listening to us right now, which I doubt.

[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.880]
Because I know my friend Helen's listening over there at Canada, but other than that, probably nobody else or nobody's listening to cast it over anymore.

[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.800]
They're all listening to Howard.

[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.180]
I reckon spot it.

[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.840]
Oh, put him on just put him on hold.

[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.560]
Don't talk to him.

[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.380]
Just put him on hold.

[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.780]
Is this that the loud mouth that won't shut up?

[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.360]
Hello?

[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.520]
Oh, and then you didn't do it.

[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.200]
Oh, there isn't God after all.

[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.340]
You didn't reboot the phone, eh?

[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.440]
So here are some...

[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.760]
Screaming in the background.

[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.720]
Screaming in the background.

[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.500]
Screaming in the background.

[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.620]
Screaming in the background.

[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.040]
Screaming in the background.

[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.860]
And I was going to have to call back a third time.

[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.760]
To be probably will.

[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.500]
You turn.

[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.320]
Time is a charm.

[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.540]
Yeah, I want to get a couple of spy reports on here.

[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.520]
I'll grab them and just relax.

[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.340]
You just sit in there and bond with Joe, okay?

[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.400]
WQAM.

[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.820]
Hey, Neil.

[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.360]
Yes, sir.

[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.840]
You know, these cops are here really bad.

[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.260]
Did you...

[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.800]
So you didn't hear Castor over this morning?

[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.100]
Okay, get out of here.

[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.860]
These politicians are...

[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.260]
Stop!

[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.140]
I don't want to hear these boring doll, that's you.

[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.220]
WQAM, Castor Overline.

[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.940]
Uh, hello.

[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.300]
You want to know about the Castor Over thing?

[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.840]
Yes, what did the Schroberg say?

[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.120]
Uh, well, Paul and Ron started dead.

[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.020]
They talked to some guy this morning who called up some news guy.

[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.480]
I don't know.

[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.020]
I'm not from the area, but I caught it.

[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.740]
Some guy that was...

[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.840]
I caught it.

[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.480]
You wish, Guy?

[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.780]
Uh, some news guy.

[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:28.540]
A news guy.

[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.640]
So he said, yes, Guy.

[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.060]
Some guy named Cliff.

[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.580]
And, uh, probably not the Yamon guy, but the, uh, some news guy anyway.

[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.320]
And, uh, he was...

[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.480]
He was...

[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.880]
Yeah, he was talking about the...

[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.780]
And they still more crap from your show.

[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.500]
I mean, three days.

[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.480]
He starts talking about, uh, Jay...

[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.660]
Uh, Boy Scouts.

[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.220]
And, of course, the 12-course-folds and other piece of your material out of his hat.

[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.260]
He says, uh, oh, next thing you know,

[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.960]
I'm probably looking at priests in the boy's guy.

[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.760]
Oh, my God.

[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.000]

[00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.940]
Are you kidding me?

[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.840]
Oh, for Christ's sake.

[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.440]
I'm back in the church.

[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.900]
Yeah, I'm going to have a talk about him.

[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.140]
Well, we're going to say, uh, he started talking about that.

[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.220]
And then all of a sudden, he got something that the thing guy Cliff, you know,

[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.440]
started talking about the psychic thing of he ripping people off of me.

[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.560]
And, Ron Brewer had made a comment about some fat person endorsing it.

[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.800]
And, boom, she called in.

[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.920]
And then Ron jumped on her ass and she started saying, uh,

[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.500]
well, you know, you don't take money from people that, uh,

[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.340]
that, uh, you know, on your show anyway, you don't do voiceovers and you don't make money off of that.

[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.240]
He says, no, man, I don't.

[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.360]
I'm just a news guy here.

[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.800]
And she says, oh, you're just pissed because you don't have any money.

[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.640]
That's...

[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.120]
Don't be fussy, though.

[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.540]
I love you.

[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.960]
Yeah, so...

[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.920]
That's not a small...

[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.160]
Oh!

[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.720]
And, uh, all of a sudden, Ron started, uh, you know,

[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.860]
he started getting a little, uh, fight you there and he started saying, you know,

[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.260]
I'm not gonna take money from people, from people like that.

[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.880]
They're honest people.

[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.580]
They're your listeners, you know, he's supposed to respect them.

[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.360]
He says, you must, uh, say, you must take a good look at your ratings book.

[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.580]
That's why you're listening to our show, trying to get material.

[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260]
And, uh, all of a sudden, this big black guy,

[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.420]
probably a big guy named Ben got on the radio and said,

[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.820]
you're gonna, Ron, we'll get it.

[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.180]
I'll come on, not down here, and I'll look you on ass.

[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.020]
Oh, you're on ass?

[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.480]
It was...

[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:09.560]
It was...

[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.340]
Yeah, well, let's talk.

[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.760]
It was, uh, some guy, he works, I guess, it works with her.

[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:14.420]
Yeah.

[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.320]
And, uh, he got on the phone and he was trying to, too,

[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.240]
Ron and he were having a fall quick and hung up on her.

[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.840]
So that was the whole thing.

[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.800]
They got to watch the show.

[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.160]
She'll sit Carlos on him next to being big trouble.

[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.480]
Yeah, well, that's the course notes.

[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.120]
If anybody tells you anything else, I, uh,

[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.640]
something up for you in one big shabang.

[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.460]
Of course, I'm gonna tell you for like 15 years, man.

[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.920]
You're the best.

[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.660]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:30.300]
Take it easy.

[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:30.920]
Thanks for the good news.

[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.340]
Nice going, Schwalg, riff, and okay.

[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:32.900]
Oh!

[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.040]
Stick it to him, man.

[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.820]
I'm so sick and tired of that rip off artist.

[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.700]
I feel sorry for you people that have to listen to him in the morning.

[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.300]
I know that Joe listens to him.

[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.800]
And I know that George listens to him.

[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:43.700]
Not.

[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.660]
Oh, you were defending him last year.

[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.900]
Last year, I said he wouldn't by default,

[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.160]
except I listened to KPX.

[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.520]
Yeah, and everybody knows that.

[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:50.800]
Right.

[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.100]
Their news is the best.

[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.540]
In other words, you can't listen to the 19-minute breaks on Howard's show.

[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.780]
To see if he's actually on the air.

[00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.280]
See, here, I wanted to, this is an amazing bulletin, okay.

[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.940]
I've just discovered, even with those gigantic numbers,

[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.100]
this means even more credit to the tremendous publicity machine behind Howard.

[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.460]
He's not even on the air.

[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.060]
No, he and Robin have both been moved.

[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.520]
They're, they're sure it wasn't even on the air anymore.

[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.860]
They just run the spots.

[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.300]
And people put down that they're listening because they can't, I mean,

[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.640]
you think we got long commercial breaks on this station?

[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.160]
I tried listening to him three times since he's been on the air.

[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.480]
What is that?

[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.800]
Three or four years he's been on down here?

[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:24.880]
Who the hell?

[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.480]
I mean, what kind of material could be that great that anybody would listen to?

[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.120]
Listen to a 19-minute commercial break.

[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.520]
There were around a 19-minute breaks.

[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.680]
In between dikes.

[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.860]
Here's a mobile in Miami Lakes.

[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.960]
Rhymes with breaks, hello.

[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:40.500]
Nail.

[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.020]
Yes, sir.

[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.580]
You got me with my mouth full.

[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.060]
Me too.

[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.060]
Oh, man.

[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.400]
Copper.

[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.880]
Copper diner, by the way.

[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.460]
Oh, I wanted to spy report Elle Goldstein last night on what's his name show, Conan O'Brien.

[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.440]
You know, I heard you say it.

[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.900]
I stayed up especially late just to watch it.

[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.280]
Funny.

[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:02.180]
He was, he was feeling under the desk at, uh, for, uh,

[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.460]
what this makes his crotch.

[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.900]
I mean, incredible.

[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.980]
Yeah, he told me he has a great desire to give oral sex to Conan O'Brien.

[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.700]
He told me that.

[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.920]
I mean, he, oh, he came out and said it.

[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.340]
Yeah.

[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.000]
He said, he said, oh, I'm in this bar and I see you, you see you, I risk guys sitting over there.

[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.140]
The, you know, drinking your brains out and blowing it's like, yeah, all right, sure, you know.

[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.740]
And, uh, I got news for you.

[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.760]
Elle is so desperate when you get to be about 8,000 pounds like he is.

[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.060]
He'd have sex with a bumblebee if it would stay still long enough.

[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.660]
You know, he said everything in the book.

[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.420]
The only thing he didn't say was that he was a fag.

[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.000]
I mean, you know, he's four wives, his homes all over.

[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.960]
He said, oh, man, you know, you know, first time I've ever seen Conan O'Brien,

[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.020]
and get embarrassed, he goes, yeah, I, my, one of my homes over an Amsterdam.

[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.320]
I go there to smoke hash and get high.

[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.280]
I mean, the audience went right.

[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:45.740]
Great.

[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.560]
The audience went crazy.

[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.280]
I love it.

[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:48.540]
Yeah.

[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.980]
I mean, it was, it was great.

[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.520]
Conan, he's a stufd shirt anyway.

[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.120]
You know, some drunk an Irishman.

[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.740]
Well, listen, thanks for the report, pal.

[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:55.680]
Loved it, man.

[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.200]
Don't forget to vote, Griffin, for president.

[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:57.940]
Oh!

[00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.660]
Freestyleik greetings for all.

[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:00.560]
That's what I say, huh?

[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.340]
And Shirley Peters, for vice-versa.

[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.300]
Oh, really, tweeter.

[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:04.960]
Well, that's really something.

[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.120]
Now, if they would have started on her, then I might have agreed.

[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.120]
But, well, Griffin, she's my hero.

[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.460]
Come on, low-missed $20 million.

[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.580]
Go just for the weekend.

[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.040]
This is so we had to go out and have a good time.

[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.400]
But don't let me forget about that Channel 7,

[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.640]
the video of the raid on the, uh, uh, Swing Club.

[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.660]
You, before you die, you must see that story on Channel 7.

[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.540]
And, of course, Channel 7, you know, would show that over and over again.

[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.780]
It was right after Brian Andrews was, you saw the bubbles coming up.

[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.480]
Freedom and safe cheese.

[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.540]
While spending the remainder of your golden years in the land of death,

[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.840]
the one thing you have to depend on is your car.

[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.100]
With two canoe theft on the rise,

[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.520]
the people who brought you a big black guy named Ben Car alarm.

[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.480]
Now bring you an old Jewish guy named Isis.

[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.820]
Get a waste from my affordable bail.

[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.280]
You big and the F.

[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.520]
Remember when we used to post a fact in Caribbean,

[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.260]
and we ought to get a one-of-a-fade, white ones at cooler.

[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.160]
Get a waste from my affordable bail.

[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.620]
You big and the F.

[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.600]
What the hell is that?

[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.440]
I object seriously.

[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.700]
So fatty like that.

[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.900]
Get a waste from my affordable bail.

[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.440]
You big and the F.

[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.740]
Get a waste from my affordable bail.

[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.120]
You big and the F.

[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.100]
Whenever some fast tries to steal my car,

[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.140]
I feel safer with an old Jewish guy named Isis.

[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.440]
Get a waste from my affordable bail.

[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.940]
You big and the F.

[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.260]
Get your old Jewish guy named Isis and Car alarm now.

[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.640]
And receive a free flower antenna.

[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.640]
Get a waste, get a waste from my affordable bail.

[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.680]
You big and the F.

[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.040]
And old Jewish guy named Isis and Car alarm.

[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.400]
I will be able to load it all there is storage.

[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.100]
By the way, Polyd just profusely better late than ever.

[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.980]
I got a request for that yesterday and forgot all about it.

[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.580]
Now let's see a week ago, Tuesday we had a request.

[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.240]
It's coming out here it is.

[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.200]
You're welcome.

[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.140]
Court strikes scouts gay ban.

[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:09.900]
How do you like that?

[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.820]
I'm actually some of the people out there don't like it.

[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.680]
Some of those right wing fundamentalists they're going,

[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.220]
oh, and they don't even know what it means except it spells your backwards.

[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.780]
New Jersey jurists say,

[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.160]
ouster violated anti bias law.

[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.060]
Trenton, New Jersey.

[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.100]
Ever been to Trenton by the way?

[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.420]
Oh my god.

[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:27.300]
Wow.

[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:28.400]
Seriously.

[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.100]
You get anywhere near Trenton and something stinks so bad.

[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.260]
You just want to scream.

[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.720]
You're sure that Adam from sales, not out not out in the Jewish Adam,

[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:36.220]
the other Adam.

[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.480]
I don't want to I don't want to do any good guys.

[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.220]
They're both good guys.

[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.620]
You know they Adam I'm talking about that as a real problem.

[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.400]
You're positive that he must be nearby when you get to Trenton.

[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.840]
Good guy bad ball problem.

[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.140]
Equating the voice got to America with public accommodations such as restaurants,

[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.640]
library schools and theaters.

[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.780]
The New Jersey Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that the organization's 1990

[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:02.740]
expulsion of a gay assistant Scott master violated the state's anti discrimination law.

[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.740]
In a seven to decision,

[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.820]
the court first rejected the Boy Scouts arguments that it is a private organization

[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:15.120]
and that its decision to remove the assistant Scott master James Dale was protected by the first amendment.

[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:22.300]
The court also dismissed the Scouts contention that homosexuality is immoral comparing that argument with discrimination against women and blacks.

[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:28.280]
After concluding that Dale's dismissal was based on a little more than prejudice,

[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.640]
Chief Justice Deborah Poritz declared the sad truth is that excluded groups and individuals

[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:38.400]
have been prevented from full participation in the social, economic and political life of our country.

[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:44.620]
The human price of this bigotry has been enormous at a most fundamental level adherence to the principle of equality,

[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.600]
demands that our legal system protect the victim of in video discrimination.

[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:55.060]
In a separate opinion, Justice Alan Handler, who was widely considered the court's staunchest liberal,

[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.760]
said he agreed with much of his colleague's legal reasoning.

[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:06.080]
Then Handler, who was retiring after this term, concluded his 44-page opinion with something of a sociological and philosophical lecture.

[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:12.560]
One particular stereotype that we renounce today is that homosexuals are inherently immoral Handler rose.

[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.360]
Wonder if Justin heard that.

[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:24.280]
That myth is repudiated by decades of social science data that convincingly established that being homosexuals does not in itself derogate from usability,

[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.360]
to participate in and contribute responsibly and positively to society.

[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:35.380]
In short, a lesbian and gay person merely because he or she is a fag is no more or less likely to be moral than a person who is heterosexual.

[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.580]
The case of Dale, who was not 29, is the second one to reach the state's highest court,

[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.960]
but the New Jersey result is the opposite of the outcome of the earlier case that wounds in California.

[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.980]
And now of course it's going to go to the Supreme Court because the boy scouts, they're pissed off.

[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.980]
And we know there's no fags in the scouts, right?

[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.780]
There's no fags in the scouts.

[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.160]
Any more than there's fags in the church or any other goddamn place.

[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.700]
So only a couple of radio guys, and that's it.

[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.760]
5.670560, 0.560 on the mobile one line.

[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.860]
I realize that nobody cared the other day when I brought up the thing about the swing clubs again.

[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160]
And the more I think about it, I think that we are in the tiny minority by the way.

[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.540]
I think we're on the odd people out on this.

[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.860]
George and yours truly.

[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.000]
He goes to him, I just defend him.

[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.240]
It's like it's lifting the same width pot.

[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.060]
He smokes it, I just defend his right to do it.

[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.680]
See, I'm lucky I'm here to defend all the abhorrent things that you do.

[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:29.180]
I'll tell you that.

[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:29.600]
That's right.

[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.260]
It's old fag.

[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.400]
It's a damn good thing.

[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.420]
Well, your fags are okay with me, even though I'm not into it.

[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:33.960]
My bag.

[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.140]
I'm squeezing it.

[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.740]
In fact, it's running over right now.

[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.800]
Thanks by the way again to the corporate diner right behind Chili's and their Pompato Park up there.

[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.900]
6300 Powerline Road and Fort Lauderdale.

[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.980]
Fatboy brought in some of good food this morning, some sandwiches without the bread.

[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.220]
And thanks to them.

[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.060]
Yeah, Fatboy came in this morning and said, you know, how much can I be happy to buy your dolphin bills tickets from you?

[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:56.820]
How much you want for them?

[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.880]
And I just tap it and I have my season dolphin to get to end purple parking passes right over here.

[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.620]
And I reached over because I am such a nice guy.

[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.660]
See, I don't hate fat boy like you do.

[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.080]
As I've tried to say many, many, many times on the air.

[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.220]
I'm not a hard ass like George.

[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.700]
I happen to be a damn nice guy in spite of the, no, seriously, I happen to be a great guy.

[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.620]
I'll tell you that myself, even though I did steal a freight train as a child.

[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.260]
In fact, I still have it in my backyard.

[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.060]
My dogs go in the squirt, squirt, pee on it twice a day.

[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.080]
But at any rate, no, so I just reached over to the bunch of tickets and I got to the bills dolphin tickets there.

[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.960]
And I ripped them out and I took the parking pass out of the purple parking pass thing.

[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:35.920]
And I handed them to him.

[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.340]
I said, no charge. Here you go.

[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.480]
How do you like that?

[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.420]
And he was like almost speechless.

[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.340]
Almost speechless, I would say.

[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.740]
Fat boy who probably because George hates him like poison thinks that I hate him too.

[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.860]
And I all I did was say, you're well, you're well, you're good.

[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:51.400]
And that was that.

[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.060]
Fat boy.

[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.000]
Or you didn't even know that I did that.

[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:55.620]
You were out of the room.

[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:56.720]
You would have, you were.

[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.060]
That's all right.

[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.460]
He's he's by average on grading on the guy.

[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.340]
That's not what they're saying.

[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.620]
Highly moved up several night.

[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.760]
I hear he stopped by over there a few times.

[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:13.320]
Yeah, he's moved fat boy just by doing nothing, not by doing anything positive just by standing still, which for him is easy.

[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:14.940]
If he can stay upright.

[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:22.320]
But just by not doing anything, he moved up several watches on the list and our sales department once we got tied wrecked.

[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.660]
And then once John penis started regressing, see John penis used to be pretty good.

[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.420]
And the guy he used to actually services to come.

[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.280]
He just brought me into piece of copy.

[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.860]
I want to apologize to Adam Silverstein by the way.

[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.760]
Because you've been replaced very quickly for the worst piece of copy in the history of the human race.

[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.340]
He just brought me in and the only reason he brought in any copy is because screw and was up here about an hour ago.

[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.740]
And I was going, Bap, Bap, Bap, Bap, Bap, Bap, Bap, you know, it's like a bunch of kindergarten kids.

[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.540]
And you have to a snitch on them to the sales manager.

[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.040]
And she has to go down there and weapon them the ass a couple of times, which you're.

[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:53.360]
Roll.

[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.140]
And boys out here.

[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.460]
And then all of a sudden they can running up here.

[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.800]
Oh, here's a new copy for, you know, so it's a for that one too.

[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.400]
And you take a look at it and what they've done is taken the old stale copy that's been in there for five months.

[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.640]
And they, you know, moved a couple of sentences around and put a period where a comma used to be.

[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:09.840]
Okay, here's your new copy.

[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.440]
We sure hope the client gets great results from this.

[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.420]
So between Todd Dreck and John penis fat boys looking better by the minute.

[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.760]
So I gave him his bills to get.

[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:26.920]
We try to want to talk by the way about that thing about giveaways on the show because last November is when I stopped him early in November I stopped doing giveaways.

[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.540]
We had a great a tremendous fall book.

[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:38.520]
We had a spectacular winner book and amazingly we recovered from a horrible April to have a tremendous spring book three kick ass books in a row on the show.

[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.740]
After we stopped giving crap away on here.

[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:50.180]
Of course we probably do have a lot now I did give Joe Costello the jets that's the last game of the season the jets all in tickets and the parking pass for same.

[00:18:51.200 --> 00:19:00.500]
But I have the other one sitting here now and I think we will discuss that today whether I should give away to some of these free loaders or I should give the Joe Costello continues a good guy and also brought me this great letter of the editor wait.

[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.840]
Wait till I read this this is this may be the most important thing.

[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.960]
But nevertheless so getting back to channel seven and the thing if the trapeze is definitely that swing club.

[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.040]
Trapeze two or one of them yeah yeah well that's the one they were showing.

[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:23.220]
And this was the BS. Oh wow I'm watching MTV on the side okay there a little number there on the beach.

[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.180]
I'm sorry just looked at and the sound too.

[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:35.260]
But anyway so they show the because naturally the BS so tape the big raid they made on this swing club.

[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:43.580]
And by the way the school board and Broward says they may reconsider the vote on that the suspensions of teachers may be overturned.

[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:53.020]
They're fighting for their jobs after the January raid on the swingers club and board member Miriam Oliphant.

[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.080]
I wonder if she's related to the cartoonist you think.

[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.500]
Tom was not his name Tom Oliphant.

[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:03.400]
Not a very common name but at any rate she said interfering in private lives troubled her conscience.

[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:08.580]
She asked when did the issue be put on the August 17 agenda for a second look they want to look at it again.

[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:17.620]
So the channel seven pieces a video tape done by the BSO no doubt or maybe the BSO alerted the media to come there you know they always pull that and tape it.

[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.760]
And here are all the swap team guys I would say there must have been 4500 of them easy.

[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:30.040]
There were 17,000 of them all in their full swap regalia swap which rhymes of course with right.

[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:30.960]
It's not.

[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:49.240]
And they're going in there like I mean you don't know whether to laugh or cry when you see this thing and here come all these poor people out of there you know they're marching them all out and they got they got the brochure from the place over their heads obviously covering their identity because now they have to feel unclean and they so dirty you know.

[00:20:50.820 --> 00:21:13.600]
And you notice by the way every time there's one of these mass these mass roundups like when they do the thing with the the johns and the hookers on this game pull of art and federal highway and they do the swing clubs every single time they do one of these deals there are judges and teachers and superintendents every single time people people from all walks of life good people scumbags you know.

[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:32.340]
Even good people get horny oh my god wow that's not good news that's right I thought only I thought really a scummy people were or that's where mayor julie Annie says in the york only trashy people want to get laid only really scummy guys want to get their rock saw.

[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:42.460]
That's what I hear that's what the lord says that's why they keep stoning all those kids to that those rocks come in handy.

[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:56.520]
Terrible just unbelievable to see that thing that they put on TV that I commend them for putting it on there because even though it's part of their hysterical if it bleeds it makes you nosebleed it leads but never let and by the way Brian Andrews he's he didn't float won't see him no more.

[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:06.100]
Here are all these grown adults that you're paying your tax dollars for in broward county in swat uniform.

[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.180]
You you would have thought that there were acts murderers inside.

[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:17.620]
It was the same it was the same deal when they had the kids being killed in little tin in the high school.

[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:26.520]
Only instead of anybody the only shooting that was going on inside court scored was that kind maybe they must have thought there were some dangerous weapons inside.

[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:46.800]
That must have been it that's why they had to send the SWAT team over there to round up all these hardened criminals at the tarzan to swing club all you gotta see that before you die you must see that tape it'll make you you won't know whether to cry laugh all the above probably you'll just go like that.

[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.020]
How about those dolphins?

[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:07.140]
I'm not sure if you have my cash with a big or safety.

[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:12.860]
Oh right.

[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.220]
I can't say but nobody cares.

[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.180]
If a little place you can't dance you can't sing but she's got a great ass.

[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.100]
Just like Steve Nichol said when he heard Aaron Summers I don't know if she can do a show but boy she sure has a great ass.

[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:29.180]
How's that show doing by the way so no costellers just lost his dolphin jets tickets very quickly.

[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:39.640]
I don't want to make him backtrack but he said that it was rip in 98 degrees for being very uncool by doing a video with some you know big boob chicken there he said in that lane anybody can do that.

[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:52.940]
I don't know anybody male or female who wouldn't be obsessed with that particular video I do like it whatever I do something what is the name of that I do I do I do I do want it badly now whatever it is in there that you like you want it.

[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.360]
Believe me when I tell you am I right.

[00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.880]
Oh I'm yeah I would like to.

[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:12.340]
It's not to like the what is it the Doritos lady whatever the career girl anyway speaking a great music by the way September 15 in Fort Lauderdale so I'm assuming at the Macarena but I don't not sure where else could it be it's got to be.

[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:12.920]
Yes I did.

[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:20.980]
Oh my god I can walk over there the back street boys returned from Europe they had 60,000 people at their concert names to them by the way.

[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:30.880]
There were in Helsinki Finland as they were number one again yesterday on TRL Carson had tears in his eyes as he was sucking up the Kevin how we an a J runner phone I'm sorry Kevin a J in the Brian on the phone.

[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:38.560]
And the Kevin let it slip with the new single is going to be which I'm very distressed about it's the first cut on the millennium album.

[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.760]
Where is that by the way it's over here.

[00:25:48.040 --> 00:26:02.440]
It sounds like sucks to be you larger than life that's going to be the new single and I'm sure that will eventually get around to show me the meaning of being lonely which is the best song on the album but the next one's got to be very much like that the back streets back not good but nevertheless that's the new single.

[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:12.940]
So there are a concert to her starts at the macro in the September 15 tickets go on sale by the way August 14 some of us will be getting free tickets and back to her paid passes and pages.

[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:19.840]
December 1st they're going to be in Orlando December 2nd in Tampa just in case there's anybody listening around the state.

[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:30.240]
Yeah that's the way we feel about it but don't take it personally by the way I'm very depressed about the horrible showing we had on the four Myers don't try to make us feel better Joey see in Joey Z that's Joey Z that's not.

[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:46.260]
Is it that's the only Joey Z I know we had a two share there meant 25 to 54 that we're like number 17 out of five stations not to great that's trying to make us feel good you know but I'm not surprised that those those pickers are there most of them the long listen to show why how would they.

[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:51.520]
They're into red next up they like that red neck they're real red necky stuff they like that a lot.

[00:26:52.720 --> 00:27:04.420]
So anyway there's the back street boys situations September 15 that'll be the first the very first concert and you realize you do understand why they're doing that because I live about 10 blocks away and they wanted to you know to move on close to where I am.

[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:10.780]
We're going to send a Rick shot to carry you a Rick Shaw is going to bring him over oh he better get that cap cap clean they'll kick his ass out of there.

[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:20.040]
Rick Shaw wouldn't know the back street boys from the main street okay that's what he knows he's still trying to figure out who the bg's are they're a little bit too recent for him.

[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:28.340]
Ricky Tiki but at least he don't steal other people's material like Paul Castrenova let's let's let's direct our special.

[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:36.660]
Hatred not that's a strong word our special distaste I don't hate him I just he's too he's too pathetic to hate.

[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:46.220]
In fact there's nobody in the local business that I hate there are people I just feel sorry for like sunny Fox is not a good example that's a great example now what do you want

[00:27:47.800 --> 00:28:16.200]

[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:53.940]
do it all by all

[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:54.800]

pretending

[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.720]

[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:30.760]
oh my god i don't want to create any uh

[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.300]
ill feelings out there but never ever put an albino in your video kids

[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.760]
where is hell

[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.920]
things up like the book shan and my eyes go big and brown

[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.320]
they're both

[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.820]
we get my feet now

[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.680]
we have to fold them down

[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.100]
i love the presentations

[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.380]
of strange hands on my thighs

[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.040]
it's like a new edit shot

[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.620]
i see don't stay too tight

[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:07.300]
the times they take their clothes off and start dancing in the aisle

[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.440]
well i know that i should make them stop

[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.840]
but it always makes me smile

[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.720]
if i pull her in your style

[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.780]
every day i have night

[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.800]
i'm riding a wimp and loco

[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:24.000]
i'm sweating my hips and my

[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.200]
riding a wimp and loco

[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.000]
they scream they cry they

[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.080]
one of the three is an albino girl

[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.040]
it's making me so rich

[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.980]
riding their wimp and loco

[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:39.700]
let's be my car's on polka

[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.440]
i'm riding a house in polka

[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:46.860]
all right 1047 at 560 wdqm and more what you'd rather see

[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:50.180]
ricky martin doing one of those baggy dances in those tight plastic pants

[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:52.680]
or at 98 degrees video over and over again

[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.200]
is that a tough question or what

[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:54.780]
is that tough?

[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:55.760]
no is it hard?

[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:56.520]
oh i bet

[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.420]
so anyway let's start out with the saints game on friday august 13

[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.740]
now stop and think about this okay

[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.440]
november of last year i finally

[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.680]
had it right and like Brian Cox will say

[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.840]
up to here up to here right up to there

[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.260]
right up to where that kid has got his finger in his nose and

[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.440]
picking his brain in that spot

[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.440]
you haven't seen that yet or you have just another shot

[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.040]
oh did they?

[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.340]
it's great it's my favorite

[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.560]
if he could just pick a little bit higher he could make a whole right where

[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.140]
Greg weeds got his two they could rub their matching holes together

[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.680]
but at any rate

[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:35.380]
that is my favorite of all time

[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:39.040]
so we stopped giving away this stuff because it was getting ponderous and

[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.200]
crappy and we get it i mean you know it's okay to make fun of a

[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.640]
bunch of uh... sucklings for a while but after and then that one guy never

[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.280]
forget as long as i live there's certain calls that just stand out in my mind

[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.900]
that i'll never forget and one of them with the guy that says

[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.960]
well you know we don't make a lot of money like you do we like free things

[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:03.160]
yeah well guess what the show is supposed to be about entertaining the

[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.320]
audience give them a few laughs getting a little pissed off crazy whatever it's

[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.380]
supposed to be not about giving you free things

[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.320]
that's not entertaining that's bad radio

[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:15.060]
like most of the radio in this town that's real bad radio uh-huh you know i'm

[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:18.900]
talking about real bad so we didn't do it uh

[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.940]
starting early november and through the fall book like i said

[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:24.900]
a monster book and out here we are it's almost a year later

[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.800]
have given away nothing how many was it just two days ago they were asking us

[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.860]
uh... oh you want to give away some some concert tickets for some crap you

[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.200]
don't want to know because then you get upset it might be something you want to

[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.000]
see what was it for

[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:40.180]
Dylan and Simon oh Bob Dylan and Paul Simon and the Moody Blues

[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:44.540]
yeah or the Moody Blues anybody wants to see the Moody Blues no no i mean the

[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.340]
Moody Blues were great a hundred years ago

[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.520]
they're probably what like 96 years old by now i would think

[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:53.160]
i'd rather see 98 degrees than 96 years old if he acts me

[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.380]
so we didn't give that away either and it makes her a hell of a while

[00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:01.560]
it just crap here and people make up all these stories and get

[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:05.480]
underneath and do you i mean like i said it's okay from a real sadistic point of

[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.600]
view to laugh at these poor bastards for a while

[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:12.280]
which we enjoy a lot by the way but nevertheless it gets a little ponderous

[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:17.660]
after a while especially the women we never hear from women ever on this show

[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:23.020]
except this lady mobile in bokeh hello hello yes ma'am hi Neil how are you

[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:27.200]

and he said you're gonna and you're gonna embarrass me so bad if i call you

[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.200]
why is that but i because he thinks you don't like women

[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:39.780]
because we're stupid that's so he feels that well maybe that's his opinion

[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.560]
i know you don't take our women of course you married him

[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.700]

[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.640]
background you don't need the Paul went to live back

[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.780]

[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.760]
husband that the answer is a positive you know have a great day

[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:57.360]
see he's the one in the back how about those tickets the answer is sir oh no no no

[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.740]
see she was she was hinting around but of course that she was she was testing the

[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:07.020]
she was sticking her toe in it yeah just to see how hot the heat was on this side

[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:12.560]
it was real hot sweetheart you never know and of course that's why i do it every

[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.540]
once in a while so like like fat boy he thought at first of all he was

[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.700]
positive i would say no i'm not gonna set you those bills often tickets

[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.240]
because you're gonna go there root for the bills

[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.340]
and you're fat of course i'm fat too not as fat as him he makes me he makes me feel a

[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:29.280]
lot better about myself you know by the way he was running a shirt today

[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:33.080]
there was button so tight that like the button is gonna pop off any second

[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.020]
do you notice that or you didn't look closely enough i can't blame you

[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:40.480]
especially before we ate that great food from that joint from the Acropre Diner

[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:44.560]
at 6300 power line road and fort Lauderdale so you give these people a couple of

[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.960]
plugs here and there and then all of a sudden you got more good free food

[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.080]
just take it from me all your kids out there like dine's here i would say

[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.520]
i would say i'll teach you how to get the free stuff

[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.940]
like with sex i mean no if you want to pay for it if you that desperate it's okay

[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.980]
but free is a lot better um sometimes

[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.440]
five six seven oh five sixty pound and of course

[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.400]
watch out for that swatting they're gonna be running there right in the

[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.460]
middle of your sex act they're gonna be rushing in there of course they won't be

[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:12.940]
looking because they don't want to get too embarrassed

[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:20.180]
i'm gonna read this great facts and the only reason i'm not taking back the

[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.900]
jet stop and tickets from jokas tello as much as i love them

[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.380]
the only reason i'm not taking them back is because he brought me this

[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.100]
back from us today this is a letter

[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.840]

according to junior in there but i'm the one that doesn't miss a thing baby

[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:51.120]

[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:57.760]
crap on the air well i'm trying to figure out what's going on what's going on you guys getting

[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.900]
warning into all the data listeners who are back at board the power 96 is how i found out

[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:07.000]
yeah what are you doing are you listening to us or what now like i said i apparently we're

[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.420]
sharing a little bit of audience and because some of your listeners called over here to tell me

[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:16.840]
like bo girl they're talking crap about you this morning so apparently but you know how it is

[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:22.120]
on the dial okay well believe so let's not be comfortable now now both a nice person but

[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:27.460]
we were just we had a guest on from channel four or for 48 hours whatever to you a cvs about

[00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:32.320]
that's going to be there i'm sure on psychic stuff and i was saying that the psychic people have

[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.740]
these stock questions that they ask and they we've had millions of them on they go so do you have

[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:40.040]
that thing is there someone named Michael in your life and everyone's like yeah then it's just

[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:44.940]
to me it's like a please and then i get on how your name came up okay all right well then that's

[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:49.300]
that fast legitimate whatever legitimate i mean i mean there's the psychic but aren't legitimate

[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:53.700]
well yeah of course they are now here here to deal with where psychic's are concerned it depends

[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:58.240]
on where your own head is that and and particularly now there's some great psychics now i can

[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:02.140]
turn you on to some psychics in a rocky world and blow your mind it's for you that you cheat

[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:06.760]
none your wife now you know we'll see that's what i'm saying it then you've got some that ain't

[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:11.140]
you know they're not good you know the name so it just depends on what your frame of reference is

[00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:16.140]
that i do know some really great ones now when you call up on the psychic line unless you request

[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:20.760]
and some of the some of the more popular psychics and no i can't guarantee who you're going to get

[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:25.020]
are you a psychic no i just hope to show you make a lot of money i know you do

[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:33.320]
and you better not be mad at that i'm not when you when you when you when you just come on the radio

[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:36.860]
right now it gets that some of them aren't very good but you're out there promoting it and it's

[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:41.200]
costing people money well you know what do you see the disclaimer at the bottom of the screen

[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:45.320]
that says for entertainment purposes only it does say for an actor for me it does i mean you know

[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:50.320]
to me so if you're an adult number one you have to be 18 to make the call and then after that

[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:55.280]
it's up to your own discretion i mean if you're an adult you make choices in your life i guess i am

[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:01.260]
you know i mean i mean only idiots i mean maybe maybe only idiots would take a look at a commercial

[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:06.380]
like that and now but you know what the other way that i feel about this is that if you wait listen

[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:10.760]
to this and then you told me how you feel about this point now let's say you go and see a psychologist

[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:15.560]
and you sit there and you bear your heart in your soul to a psychologist and at the end of the

[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:19.640]
session they charge you a hundred and fifty dollars and you have learned one thing about yourself

[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:24.380]
and it's okay we'll book your appointment for next week instead of being illuminating and clarifying

[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:28.660]
and giving you some real advice what is the difference if they keep you from putting a gun to your head

[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:33.920]
three o'clock in the morning i say go for it well i'll tell you this here's the difference your

[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:38.400]
insurance company will pay for psychiatric problems but they won't pay for you to call one of the

[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:42.180]

especially that ponderous a bourish run broo run there those goody two shoes these are the same

[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:19.760]
people that just had the mayor on there a few weeks ago and suck his ass until they couldn't get

[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.840]
their tongue in any deeper

[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:26.020]
trying to put over that one penny sales tax which all the rest of us said

[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:32.220]
oh vehemently no to 68 to 32% and tried to block out the opposing calls based on oh well we

[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:35.680]
got a lawsuit going we can't talk to them can't give them any airtime cut them off

[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:40.520]
just like they hung up on show gripping and Felix this morning because they're a bunch of cowards

[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:46.980]
see at least she had enough integrity and honesty to say she's making a whole lot of money baby

[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:53.280]
she's a spokesman that's right and it says right on there if you're a schmuck if you're

[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.660]
a consenting adult and you believe in his crap go ahead and call we'll take your money

[00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:01.560]
and say right on there you know just like Ron Popeel he might as well come on there to begin those

[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:05.740]
informers who say hey you know that pocket fisherman all those other stupid little plastic

[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:09.660]
pieces of crap that i sold you for 30 and 40 and 50 bucks oh here's another one

[00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:14.380]
this is the only guy that could take two pieces of paper and say oh and if you really enjoy

[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:19.460]
this machine everything is a machine if you notice that he could take two sticks oh and here's

[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:26.440]
the Ron Popeel stick machine and people are sitting in 16 easy payments of only 3995 and he's saying

[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:32.920]
okay yeah all right yeah i'll take your money the house wrong with that they're just

[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:37.660]
jealous that they didn't come up with a guy named psychic sparts or whatever that hotline is

[00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:43.920]
this week a bunch of hypocritical and addition to which i thought there was supposed to be an

[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:48.420]
entertainment show isn't it i mean this show it's entertainment it's a whole bunch of things

[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.780]
on this show it's whatever the hell i want but i thought they were supposed to be entertaining

[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:57.040]
a more in show are they are they like now dictating a morality and uh taste so is that what that's

[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:03.220]
all about saving the public from itself and just to show you how stupid the public is Paul and Ron

[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:07.260]
there are people listening to your show although i noticed in this last book not nearly as many

[00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:13.820]
as used to but nevertheless some so how do you like that consenting adults sum enough that

[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:19.040]
that's that's entertaining so again it ties right in with this letter which i know it's only

[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:22.000]
taking me an hour to quarter to get to but boy what a good job Neil thank you

[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:27.040]
oh god excellent look in this in fact even Tom Green never milked anything this good

[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:35.160]
show see begonee and hinting west virginia says this is a case in point and ties right in with what

[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:41.760]
we just had yeah he says i'm an adjunctance and structure in a small college and i'm amazed to find

[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:46.840]
just within the past three or four years that college students know very little the terrible

[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:51.880]
thing about it is that they don't know how much they don't know for example i teach a class in

[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:55.960]
which the opening lecture begins where they historical account of the subject that dates to the

[00:56:55.960 --> 00:57:01.380]
ancient Persians not one of my students knew of the person there had ever heard of them we moved on

[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:05.760]
in the lecture to the Roman Empire not one of them knew anything about the Roman Empire or had

[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:12.320]
heard of it had ever heard of it they thought the Roman Empire was frank pulley

[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:19.060]
to my utter amazement i found that none of them had studied american or us history these are college

[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:24.000]
students they did not know anything about the founding fathers of this nation or why i was founded

[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.320]
almost no one knew who Thomas Jefferson was except one boy who knew that Jefferson had a

[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:33.400]
home in Charlottesville Virginia but didn't know what he did in life none of them could tell me who

[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:38.900]
the pilgrims were i questioned them about the hall world war two and about the holocaust but

[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:42.360]
their only answer was that they had seen the movie shinler's list but they didn't know if it was a

[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:48.640]
true movie i finally asked them if you don't know the past how are you the future citizens of this

[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:54.860]
country going to govern the country their answer was why do you have to know the past i honestly

[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:59.180]
believe that none of them realized they know nothing and were still they don't care that they know

[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:08.520]
there is the greatest letter the history of america the USA today from an instructor in a small college

[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:14.940]
and it's not only small colleges it's your major universities it's most of them how many times

[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:18.840]
in a 23 years i've been on a year here they run those things in the newspaper where they they put

[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:26.080]
these they these real simple tests out at uofm talk about a bunch of real intellectuals and they

[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:30.640]
put things in there like the map of the u.s they can't name the states and most of them can't even

[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:36.240]
find on the map their hometown wonder and the ones who are from here also can't find it they can't

[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:44.900]
find it in the map either how is it possible to go through life and be so god damn it's amazing to

[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:48.880]
me and you wonder why we have all these social problems in this country i'm not going to change

[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:54.020]
this in here go and bet that that down a radio but Jesus Christ somebody's got a point of finger

[00:58:54.020 --> 00:59:01.220]
to it and what a great letter that is they don't know squat the roman empire they never heard of

[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:07.160]
you know maybe getting out maybe getting out of that 10 block radius might actually do something

[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.700]
for like i'm always telling you about traveling and going to real living and breathing places and

[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:23.220]
seeing different kinds of people in different parts of the world and it's kind of like oh would

[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:27.060]
the millions call up the psychic hotline and watch in jerry springer and while the women are

[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:31.600]
ringing the phones off the hook on channel four ones god damn Oprah coming back on you wonder

[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:39.880]
is this woman ever said anything of significance in the 87,000 years that she's been on the year

[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:45.880]
and those idiotic uh smarmy mushy books that she's always promoting on there is there one of them

[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:51.680]
ever been worth reading no but those women it's a cult and you wonder why they went down here and

[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:56.460]
I had Kool-Aid with Jim Jones and had the god damn putting with the doh re me uh what are we talking

[00:59:56.460 --> 01:00:04.020]
about here yeah doh re me by solar lots the rest of it yeah the rest of it is the dough that's what the

[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:10.720]
bow says bow says just give me the dough i'm power 96 nice going bow seeing it i'm talking about this

[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:15.860]
psychic thing and it ties right in just coincidentally i haven't seen her in months have you see i

[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:24.220]
haven't seen bow in a month i see her every day why is that because i've won to the halls every

[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:30.360]
known again let me say it again i haven't seen her in months she used to pop her head into door

[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:34.440]
down on the second floor and a couple of times i went over there and power 96 nights here but i

[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:38.600]
haven't seen her in months this morning i see her outside we have a very humorous exchange she knows

[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.260]
i'm having a good time with her psychic dark network and she's laughing all the way to the bank

[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:46.620]
she doesn't care she's got a good sense of humor we're laughing about it i'm saying lowly

[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:52.420]
fifty million dollars she's out think about it and she probably could you're just jealous you

[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:56.960]
losers over there working for a queer channel that's the problem and you know something i'd be

[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.820]
neurotic too i mean i don't work for rocket scientists i mean these people are not bad people

[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:12.240]
they're nice they're weak they're dumb but they're okay you know they treat us okay we don't have

[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:17.880]
we don't have that so who the hell are you guys kidding you work and wasn't it interesting they

[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:21.700]
worked for paxons they work for queer channel they're horrors like anybody else it makes no

[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:25.640]
difference who signs their paycheck they'll go on the year they're in suck-ass they don't give a crap

[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.680]
and they're putting her down because she's making money from other people stupidity that's

[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:35.260]
what it's all about basically unfortunately you got something good to sell almost nobody wants it

[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:40.080]
but if you got some real crap like every time at christmas time i'd come out with some new ugly doll

[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:44.480]
that people are killing each other or for a walmart and came art because they got to have the last one

[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:50.080]
oh i got to have it i got to have it give me that cabbage pack now it's so ugly

[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:57.900]
yeah like your kid probably here's a dear field hello male yes sir i'm a little nervous

[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:03.080]
but nevertheless uh you're absolutely right i think uh i love bow i think she does great job

[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:08.300]
whatever she wants to do on the side is fine right uh well back Paul Kesson over reminds me of

[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:16.340]
early steve cane what what a what a shot it's like it's like he's like he's learning from the

[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:20.780]

[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.720]
and we know you're listening right now Paul by the way pretty lame effort pretty weak response

[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:44.020]
and how come since it's your show you know what that would be like they would be like if if

[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:48.360]
one of the somebody else from the market called us on a year and i led George to sit here and

[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:53.240]
blah blah blah you know it's your show isn't it casted over supposedly and that only reinforces

[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:58.000]
what i said the very perspicacious needle head said a half hour before and that is the few times

midnight our time am I correct about that I think I am yeah nine to midnight I think that would

[01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:50.130]
make for some great programming on the station that any catering come on at midnight until you know

[01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:53.390]

You didn't say too much before I was back to try to say

[01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:47.290]
You knew we couldn't win

[01:14:47.290 --> 01:14:53.210]
You hiding, I'm hiding, I'm a real body farmer

[01:14:53.210 --> 01:14:58.530]
In a time that's fine to record your body farmer

[01:14:58.530 --> 01:15:01.190]
A real body farmer

[01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:10.730]
Hey Mickey tell me why you're still a certain type of baby

[01:15:10.730 --> 01:15:16.150]
Hey baby, how sad does it hurt to live on?

[01:15:16.410 --> 01:15:18.430]
That's when, when you scream

[01:15:19.190 --> 01:15:23.190]
There's no proposition to serve on that doesn't

[01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:28.570]
Run the truth without the love that falls to where you hide

[01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:31.470]
Talk for this your foreshadow

[01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:34.110]
Find a mission like a guy

[01:15:34.110 --> 01:15:36.990]
And your foreshadow's a guy

[01:15:37.570 --> 01:15:42.050]
You hiding, I'm a real body farmer

[01:15:42.570 --> 01:15:47.530]
In a time that's fine to record your body farmer

[01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:50.370]
You're a real body farmer

[01:15:50.370 --> 01:15:52.570]
And there's a classic example again

[01:15:52.570 --> 01:15:53.970]
Okay, she's gonna take the money

[01:15:54.570 --> 01:15:56.670]
Although silly people out there buying her records

[01:15:57.150 --> 01:15:59.870]
Getting all excited every time she comes on there with her leather pants

[01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:03.550]
Chicking that questionable thing whatever is in them

[01:16:04.530 --> 01:16:05.430]
Why the hell not?

[01:16:09.450 --> 01:16:10.510]
Wouldn't you take the money?

[01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:13.170]
If there were a bunch of silly people out there saying

[01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:16.370]
Oh my god you're so great, Mickey, Mickey, Mickey, all

[01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:18.970]
You'd say it's only 50, and we got it

[01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:20.790]
And they're not gonna get it anyway

[01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:25.830]
567-0560-050560 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:28.970]
Here's Miami, hello

[01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:31.590]
Jesus Christ, that song you can't avoid it

[01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:33.670]
I know it's everywhere, like a cancer

[01:16:33.670 --> 01:16:37.610]
Yeah, before I go into my diet tribe I want to tell you that

[01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:40.890]
Fill is on from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. art time

[01:16:40.890 --> 01:16:43.230]
So that's what, 7 to 10 over there

[01:16:43.670 --> 01:16:47.150]
Yeah, I think so yeah, yeah, he's got a cold so he hasn't been doing the voices too much

[01:16:47.150 --> 01:16:47.450]
I know

[01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:49.670]
Still a little bit of a connoisseur

[01:16:49.670 --> 01:16:53.870]
Anyway, sir, as usual you hit the nail right between the thighs

[01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:54.650]
Are you sure?

[01:16:55.170 --> 01:16:56.830]
With that piece you just read

[01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:59.110]
10 p.m. to 1 a.m. would be even better, wouldn't it?

[01:16:59.150 --> 01:17:00.030]
The egg would be excellent

[01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:02.150]
24 hours a day, 7 days a week

[01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:02.570]
Are you?

[01:17:03.130 --> 01:17:05.990]
Beats the hell out of whatever we got planned down here except for you of course

[01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.210]
Yeah

[01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:07.650]
Can you hear the second sound?

[01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.930]
Yeah

[01:17:07.930 --> 01:17:11.750]
Well anyway, with all seriousness, that piece you read

[01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:13.730]
It's beautiful about the ignorance

[01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:17.430]
It ties beautifully into everything you talk about

[01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:20.490]
It's exactly where we got so much fear in this goddamn country

[01:17:20.490 --> 01:17:24.230]
Why if you're a quote unquote fag, you can't do this, you can't be in this

[01:17:24.230 --> 01:17:26.030]
Because everybody's so goddamn ignorant

[01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:27.990]
Right, or if your sparsal like Bro Griffin

[01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:29.770]
Precisely

[01:17:30.330 --> 01:17:32.450]
Like that last, forget about that last call

[01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:34.030]
There's probably John Ford doing a voice

[01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:36.990]
But I'll give you an example

[01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:37.830]
A dumb voice

[01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:40.350]
I like going to the mall and I'm not a pervert

[01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:42.850]
I like going to the mall at the end of the day doing some shopping

[01:17:42.850 --> 01:17:44.990]
I sit down when I'm tired, get a cup of coffee

[01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:46.070]
And I like looking at kids

[01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.790]
All right

[01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:48.970]
I like watching young boys and young girls play

[01:17:48.970 --> 01:17:50.270]
Not because it gives me an impression

[01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:51.210]
What do you say kids?

[01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:53.150]
Well you know like toddlers

[01:17:53.150 --> 01:17:54.350]
Oh, seven-year-olds

[01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.630]
Okay

[01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:57.010]
You know they got those little recesses in the

[01:17:57.010 --> 01:17:59.370]
The fourth of mall so they can play and do whatever they want

[01:17:59.370 --> 01:18:00.750]
These are hamburgers

[01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:02.370]
Little kids having a good time

[01:18:02.370 --> 01:18:03.610]
Well yeah, having a good time

[01:18:03.610 --> 01:18:06.550]
And it's one of the few things in this world today that brings us out of my face

[01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:07.930]
I love kids, they're beautiful creatures

[01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:10.030]
They're all very beautiful kids

[01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:11.590]
They're eyeballing me

[01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:14.110]
Like I'm some kind of a, like I'm going to go to the mall

[01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:14.690]
A battle group

[01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:15.770]
Well, that's like a teacher

[01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:17.930]
You realize a teacher can't even pat a kid on a back seat

[01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:18.710]
Nice job, Johnny

[01:18:18.710 --> 01:18:19.250]
Great, that's it

[01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:20.130]
Or whatever, and right away

[01:18:20.130 --> 01:18:22.670]
Oh, thanks, you're a harassment, you're going to lose your job

[01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:23.990]
Like I'm going to go to the mall

[01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:26.230]
A bathroom next and rub myself raw

[01:18:26.230 --> 01:18:27.890]
To rerun the romper room or something

[01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:28.170]
Right

[01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:29.830]
I just want to watch the kids play

[01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.370]
Now I'm going to get kicked out of the mall and reported

[01:18:32.370 --> 01:18:33.910]
But it's because today with the...

[01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:36.190]
I'm going to wear those green jeans in there though, if I were you

[01:18:36.190 --> 01:18:38.370]
Well, I do wear some tight jeans, but that's not the reason

[01:18:38.890 --> 01:18:41.370]
But it's like if you're a little bit full of color

[01:18:41.370 --> 01:18:41.370]

[01:18:41.370 --> 01:18:45.610]
As centimeter to the left is the right of what they consider normal

[01:18:45.610 --> 01:18:46.870]
You're a friggin' pervert

[01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:47.090]
Right

[01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:49.070]
So what are we going to friggin' grow up with?

[01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:49.490]
We're not

[01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:51.150]
It's just like the thing with the swing clubs

[01:18:51.150 --> 01:18:55.670]
Like I said at the beginning of the show today, I've just seen that horrible footage on Channel 7 this morning

[01:18:57.010 --> 01:19:01.330]
It's a very tiny minority of us who believe that if consenting adults want to do whatever the hell they want

[01:19:01.330 --> 01:19:01.930]
Then it's okay

[01:19:01.930 --> 01:19:05.430]
And the rest of the people are going, oh my god, but their teachers are their judges

[01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:07.990]
Whatever, what the hell they're going to do is that make, who's business is it?

[01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:09.370]
How does it affect anything?

[01:19:09.490 --> 01:19:10.290]
Exactly, yeah

[01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:11.910]
It's the needs in your own life

[01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:17.470]
This idea that sex is so goddamn dirty, everybody wants to do it, but please don't admit it to anybody

[01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:20.550]
Like teenage sex, God forbid the teenagers are sexual creatures

[01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:21.070]
Yeah

[01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:24.250]
You know, so no, we can't do that, that's bad, that's bad, shut it off, shut it off

[01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:26.810]
I'm not shutting it off, I'm watching right now

[01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:29.810]
Yeah, me too, www.youngboys.com, let me tell you

[01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:31.690]
But now speaking of which...

[01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:36.510]
Oh, we got a trace this call by the way George, we got a real pedophile on it

[01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:38.370]
No, I did the Star 67, sorry

[01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.930]
I'm sure you did

[01:19:40.770 --> 01:19:42.510]
I think it was probably the Star 69

[01:19:42.930 --> 01:19:44.490]
Well, you know, every chance I get

[01:19:44.490 --> 01:19:46.910]
I want to sit down in front of the freaking computer

[01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:48.070]
For a job, I'm losing myself

[01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:51.890]
And download myself to hell because I don't want to deal with the real world

[01:19:52.710 --> 01:19:55.230]
I'm not the pervert, the real world is the freaking pervert

[01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:56.770]
Right, that's what I'll pedophile say

[01:19:56.770 --> 01:19:57.910]
So let's all move to...

[01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:59.170]
Okay, I'll be in Thailand, okay

[01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:02.290]
Oh, he was doing so well, yeah

[01:20:02.290 --> 01:20:04.870]
I think Phil would be embarrassed, you know

[01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:06.930]
Yeah, but wait a second

[01:20:08.290 --> 01:20:10.410]
5670560, pound 560 on the...

[01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:11.450]
Who was that by the way?

[01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:13.870]
That sounded like a radio person to make, didn't it?

[01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:17.170]
Who obviously doesn't want to be identified for obvious reasons

[01:20:17.170 --> 01:20:20.810]
So I'd be looking out for him, he's probably making an appearance at him all nearby you pretty soon

[01:20:21.290 --> 01:20:22.410]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:25.590]
Here's a mobile in Miami Beach, hello

[01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:27.970]
Yes, I'm going to take care of my call

[01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:29.210]
And thanks for making your call

[01:20:29.710 --> 01:20:32.570]
How do you like this last petophile here who finally outed himself?

[01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:34.330]
Oh my god, you should trade that call

[01:20:35.370 --> 01:20:37.670]
Listen, I hate to change the topic on you again

[01:20:37.670 --> 01:20:41.810]
I have a couple of comments regarding the average American college student

[01:20:41.810 --> 01:20:46.390]
And as you can tell by my accent, I'm a crowd-battery, it came over four years ago

[01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:51.290]
And I taught sports in the German school system

[01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:54.370]
And over here in the Bay County Puppet School system

[01:20:54.370 --> 01:21:02.070]
And what I found is that teachers are really not very well respected over here

[01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:05.470]
And there's a lot of social promotion going on

[01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:14.790]
If you don't do your stuff, if you just don't have it, you're not being passed on to the next grade

[01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:17.570]
And it's exactly the case here and in the States

[01:21:18.370 --> 01:21:21.210]
There's pressure from parents at the college level

[01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:23.590]
There's the pressure, there's money involved

[01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:26.070]
And you just want to pass on the students

[01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:29.590]
And that's all the responsible people can't have that

[01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:33.810]
You got it, that's your American way, man

[01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:36.250]
So I said, and we're not going to charge it

[01:21:36.250 --> 01:21:37.930]
I don't know what the solution is

[01:21:37.930 --> 01:21:40.130]
The way it works in New York, I'm sure you're aware of that

[01:21:40.130 --> 01:21:43.270]
It's into a Holland fan, probably not a big Germany fan though, right?

[01:21:43.290 --> 01:21:47.450]
And by the way, in the Netherlands, they have the highest test scores of any company in the world

[01:21:48.090 --> 01:21:51.830]
And with all that weed and with all that sex and all the freedom that they enjoy

[01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:55.490]
They have the highest test scores of brightest young people in any country in the world

[01:21:55.490 --> 01:22:00.590]
Yeah, I think one of the reasons is, after elementary school in Europe

[01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:04.870]
What happens is the school system first puts up, you have a vocational school

[01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:08.450]
You have kind of a middle school and you have a public gynazium

[01:22:08.450 --> 01:22:09.550]
Which is...

[01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:10.010]
Adnazium?

[01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:13.070]
Yeah, it's for people that want to go on to study

[01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:18.210]
So after fourth grade, the teachers sit down with the students and with his or her parents

[01:22:18.210 --> 01:22:22.270]
And they talk about what school system is best for him and her

[01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:25.070]
And they decide whether he should go on to...

[01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:29.990]
To be known as in the high school form or whether he should go into a vocational school

[01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:33.830]
And that way you have students in the school systems that are sort of on the same level

[01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:38.610]
And I've found that it's a much better solution

[01:22:38.610 --> 01:22:43.610]
Here in the United States, you try to cram everyone into the high school system no matter how intelligent they are

[01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:44.770]
You can't...

[01:22:44.770 --> 01:22:47.210]
I used to take those kids here in Sena and what they used to call shop

[01:22:47.210 --> 01:22:49.490]
And now they just make them like Sanford and Sunford, a few episodes

[01:22:49.490 --> 01:22:55.130]
And now you have to know you have gifted programs and all this other crap in the Bay County public schools

[01:22:55.130 --> 01:23:01.770]
And right now I'm teaching at the University here in town and the students I get in my in my German class, it's just a troche

[01:23:01.770 --> 01:23:04.470]
You talked about history for the...

[01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:07.450]
The role of the person, talk about English grammar

[01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:08.790]
You don't make them a doctor?

[01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:11.150]
They can't refuse because you guys are good at that

[01:23:12.450 --> 01:23:13.670]
Neil, I love...

[01:23:13.670 --> 01:23:15.510]
I have a lot of true friends

[01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:16.290]
Right

[01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:19.730]
I love to listen to your show itself

[01:23:20.130 --> 01:23:22.570]
I'm not one of these Nazi bastards from over there

[01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:24.750]
I've got to joke, lighten up a little bit

[01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:28.610]
See, your Germans tend to be a little bit too uptight, relax, loosen up

[01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:31.350]
I love Cologne, Cologne, whatever they do

[01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:33.170]
Oh, I love it, it's a great city

[01:23:33.570 --> 01:23:34.070]
You do?

[01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:35.110]
Yes, I do

[01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:36.790]
I hope they treat you nice thing over there

[01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:37.970]
They do, they treat us great

[01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:39.550]
Why don't you like Cologne?

[01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:43.670]
I like to tell them that it's a little bit better, the unit is nice

[01:23:43.670 --> 01:23:45.570]
I've never been to Monchain, I haven't been there yet

[01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:48.310]
Nice pronunciation, you got the UMA doing there

[01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:53.290]
I love your show and you have to give up a good work

[01:23:53.290 --> 01:23:54.350]
Okay, and Zagazone

[01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:55.330]
Okay, you too

[01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:58.830]
56670560, 0560

[01:23:58.830 --> 01:24:03.130]
I love the German people, the younger ones, the older ones still are like a bunch of Nazis

[01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:05.990]
Here's a fact from Mike and Kendall who says

[01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:11.110]
His opinion regarding several things, A, he first heard I do by 98 degrees

[01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:13.070]
During the videos premiere, I enjoyed the video and the song

[01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:14.850]
So much he went out and bought the album, nice going, Mike

[01:24:14.850 --> 01:24:15.610]
Oh, guy

[01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:21.310]
He says I detest Fudion, Y100 all the way, enjoy listening to J. Alexander's voice

[01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:25.730]
And he commends Schwo Griffin for defending herself during Zagaz morning show

[01:24:25.730 --> 01:24:29.510]
She's entitled to endorse product and services and to make all the money she wants

[01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:36.170]
It reminds me of the criticism he says that Governor Jesse Ventura has taken for participating in a WWF event

[01:24:36.170 --> 01:24:40.130]
Why not, why not, why not, why the WWF not is what I say

[01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:45.730]
We had more people like Jesse Ventura running around who have some idea what life is really all about

[01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:46.910]
We being really good shape

[01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:50.410]
Instead of having to hear a more bull crap about the Clinton sex life

[01:24:50.410 --> 01:24:54.030]
It was the abuse when he was four years old and then he sleep with his mom like Elvis

[01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:56.270]
I mean, talk about desperate, desperate

[01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:58.970]
And you wonder why the people are dumb, do you, Emmy?

[01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:02.950]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60

[01:25:03.670 --> 01:25:05.690]
05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:25:05.690 --> 01:25:07.490]
I guess we already kind of ate today didn't we?

[01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.990]
Sort of

[01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:12.250]
Maybe I'll get something from truck just before I leave

[01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:14.270]
You know the kind of time you over in the car on the way home

[01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:16.890]
Like some cool cuts or something like that

[01:25:16.890 --> 01:25:20.170]
Thanks again to Fat Boy and you're welcome for those damn bills or dolphin tickets

[01:25:20.670 --> 01:25:24.230]
And I know some of you'll be upset because there's a guy that's going to be rooting for the bills during that game

[01:25:24.230 --> 01:25:24.810]
Too bad

[01:25:26.610 --> 01:25:29.370]
For some beer on him if you have to reform my cover a part of me

[01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:30.810]
Here's Miami, hello

[01:25:32.230 --> 01:25:32.550]
Miami

[01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:34.490]
Hello Neil

[01:25:34.490 --> 01:25:35.030]
Yes?

[01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:36.010]
How are you, Bobby?

[01:25:37.450 --> 01:25:41.230]
No, before I get into like what I want to talk about, I don't know if you caught our bull came up mad on Conan

[01:25:41.230 --> 01:25:42.110]
No, I did not

[01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:45.190]
Oh my god, that fat bastard

[01:25:45.190 --> 01:25:46.590]
We had one spy report

[01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:50.430]
You have to, you had to, I mean there has to be somebody out there who's taped

[01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:51.070]
He was

[01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:53.970]
Oh, I know, I don't want to see you, I wonder how I want to see that

[01:25:53.970 --> 01:25:57.450]
I mean, I see enough of him without seeing himself a grandizing TV appearances

[01:25:57.450 --> 01:26:00.870]
I mean, I'm familiar with Al Stick and you know, his whole thing but I mean

[01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:01.090]
It's Dick

[01:26:01.090 --> 01:26:05.350]
I mean, my jar opened, I couldn't believe I could

[01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:07.890]
I thought Conan was going to jump out of his seat at the door of God

[01:26:07.890 --> 01:26:10.090]
I'm sure Al was ecstatic when you're open

[01:26:10.090 --> 01:26:10.890]
He was as

[01:26:12.430 --> 01:26:14.050]
No, he's trying to break me up here

[01:26:14.050 --> 01:26:20.590]
Anyways, that's actually what earlier, that article about the demifying of American people

[01:26:20.590 --> 01:26:24.050]
It's about how dumb college students are, who hasn't actually become adults someday

[01:26:24.450 --> 01:26:28.030]
Absolutely, listen, I go to school, I mean I work with this one girl who just graduated

[01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:33.010]
Court and Court with honors and you know, needing the aberrant, you know, self-loathing bastard that I am

[01:26:33.010 --> 01:26:35.990]
I just had a way, you know what, I'm just going to test her and see how smart she is

[01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:39.170]
You know, I just go to, I don't even know how many states are in the United States of America

[01:26:39.170 --> 01:26:39.590]
Yeah

[01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:42.070]
She couldn't tell you how many senators and the half the representers

[01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:45.830]
She couldn't say any of these and she didn't tell you how many senators and the House of Representatives

[01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:46.790]
Well, something like that

[01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:47.170]
Oh, okay

[01:26:47.170 --> 01:26:49.230]
You know, really, I'm a part of the system too, you know

[01:26:50.110 --> 01:26:51.090]
Alright, Neil, please

[01:26:51.090 --> 01:26:51.830]
Have a great day

[01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:56.530]
Okay, boy, he ran real quickly, he was doing real good till he got to that

[01:26:56.530 --> 01:26:58.150]
How many senators are there in the year?

[01:26:59.170 --> 01:27:04.410]
It's 1156, 567, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:27:04.410 --> 01:27:06.790]
Let's face it, it's the country, it's dumb people with guns

[01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:10.190]
There you go, come on, you can do it

[01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:13.290]
God, that aversion therapy works great

[01:27:13.290 --> 01:27:16.510]
So anyway, we find out who that was, that voice, that pedophile I was on there

[01:27:17.490 --> 01:27:20.450]
Sitting around in the mall, pretending he wants to, he enjoys looking at little kids

[01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:22.450]
And then we find out that he's in the restroom rubbing something

[01:27:22.450 --> 01:27:23.670]
What was that all about?

[01:27:24.850 --> 01:27:28.110]
That was really bizarre, I mean, really bizarre

[01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:41.530]
He's got had a bomb

[01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:46.910]
And took a hit in Woody, act like Cheech and Chong

[01:27:47.530 --> 01:27:52.310]
And give some munchies and make brownies filled with hair

[01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:57.890]
And Woody share it with Jesus and the saints

[01:27:57.890 --> 01:28:00.890]
The highest fire hits

[01:28:00.890 --> 01:28:05.890]
And yeah, yeah, heart is great

[01:28:05.890 --> 01:28:10.530]
And yeah, yeah, heart is good

[01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:16.130]
And yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[01:28:16.130 --> 01:28:19.290]
What has got no cannabis?

[01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:25.230]
Smoke and blood might want a bust

[01:28:26.430 --> 01:28:30.510]
Gives a high on the back of the bust

[01:28:30.510 --> 01:28:35.810]
Just in the nose it's getting stoned

[01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:39.350]
On a grey hump of two rows

[01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:44.290]
To get some bad luck in homegrown

[01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:50.810]
So it's the awful time back to take home

[01:28:54.810 --> 01:28:58.710]
Most of the five Marley on his throne

[01:28:59.810 --> 01:29:00.650]
All right

[01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:06.570]
No fun in heaven if you're so

[01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:11.430]
Yeah, travel to at 5.60 W.Q.M. I feel so depressed right now

[01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:17.790]
I have just received the worst facts in the history of the facts machine

[01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:22.750]
I'm telling you, not just our facts machine in the history of the facts machine itself

[01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:25.230]
That's not the facts norm setting is concerned

[01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:28.230]
Oh, you spoiled it

[01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:29.630]
Oh, I'm sorry

[01:29:30.670 --> 01:29:32.550]
You when you see it you will be sorry

[01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:33.850]
Why do you tell you what it was about?

[01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:35.410]
No, it was gonna be great

[01:29:35.410 --> 01:29:35.970]
You'll be sorry

[01:29:36.710 --> 01:29:38.770]
You'll be real sorry

[01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:40.770]
Not a sorry as he'll be

[01:29:42.570 --> 01:29:43.870]
You know, a norm can for those

[01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:46.190]
He's got a few friends out there including yours truly

[01:29:47.150 --> 01:29:50.390]
Good guy, giant ego, thinks he's a broadcaster

[01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:53.310]
But had a great battle with cancer

[01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:54.930]
He's doing great, completely cancer-free

[01:29:54.930 --> 01:29:56.370]
He's sounding good, he's feeling good

[01:29:56.370 --> 01:29:58.750]
He's growing some of his hair back, he is ready to rock and roll

[01:29:59.370 --> 01:30:00.410]
That's great, that's the good news

[01:30:00.410 --> 01:30:04.610]
The bad news is that even after this 6 or 7 or 8 month battle, whatever it's been

[01:30:04.610 --> 01:30:07.630]
Norm still can't rid himself of this obsession

[01:30:07.630 --> 01:30:11.430]
He's got the idea, the notion that he has, he put the notion in the basket

[01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:13.510]
That he's a broadcaster

[01:30:14.590 --> 01:30:16.190]
Because of those days on the light bulb

[01:30:16.190 --> 01:30:20.170]
Well, here's the ad from Al Goldstein that was in Screw Magazine

[01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:25.030]
That's the Al Goldstein on late night with Conan O'Brien, August 4th, etc.

[01:30:26.250 --> 01:30:29.050]
And Norm has very cleverly taken this ad

[01:30:30.690 --> 01:30:34.910]
Crashed out late night with Conan O'Brien and crossed out Al Goldstein

[01:30:35.670 --> 01:30:40.230]
Or anyway, it says Al Goldstein has never been on the Craig Worthing show, but Norm can't will be

[01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:50.310]
Late night with Craig Worthing, August 5th, 1999, 7pm on WSR-something, somewhere on your dial

[01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:52.010]
Thursday, today

[01:30:53.150 --> 01:30:55.170]
Norm can't's premiere return performance

[01:30:56.170 --> 01:30:58.230]
Even Mark Mosley is embarrassed by that

[01:30:58.230 --> 01:31:01.930]
Even he is humiliated, Norm can't on the Craig Worthing show on the station

[01:31:02.890 --> 01:31:07.290]
1970 on the dial right next to that new sports station, more laughing and laughing right next to that one

[01:31:07.970 --> 01:31:11.590]
Tell us for all by the way, that was a great job and Paul's a real asshole and we hit him like poison

[01:31:13.570 --> 01:31:17.330]
How do you like this? I mean, Norm can't, here's the guy that just battled miraculously

[01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:20.490]
They took a 15 pound tumor out of this man's puppet, okay?

[01:31:21.930 --> 01:31:29.630]
And to his credit fought like a trooper, he has completely cancer-freeze undergone all the tests, the bull and marrow, great news for everybody

[01:31:30.190 --> 01:31:33.590]
We wish him all the best, he's doing great sound and great like his old self

[01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:36.950]
And unfortunately, this part of his old self has reared its ugly head

[01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:43.470]
Oh my God

[01:31:46.810 --> 01:31:50.950]
You know something, at this point of my life, there's only one thing I can say

[01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:51.710]
Where is Delta?

[01:31:52.650 --> 01:31:52.810]
Oh

[01:31:55.890 --> 01:32:01.030]
5,670560, pound 560 on a mobile one line, we got 200 or 300 open lines here, you better get in there on this show

[01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:05.590]
Because otherwise I'll start talking about this spokesman and the last great move made by the Panther organization

[01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:07.170]
Which I know none of you care about

[01:32:08.170 --> 01:32:13.170]
Yeah, this is a great town to have a hockey conversation in, that's why I keep asking that question by the way

[01:32:13.170 --> 01:32:13.870]
Where is Delta?

[01:32:14.090 --> 01:32:17.130]
Because finding a hockey fan in this town is looking like for a needle in a haystack

[01:32:17.130 --> 01:32:20.890]
Like looking for an IQ of better than ten at the U of M

[01:32:22.530 --> 01:32:25.750]
Looking for somebody that's not taking wind surfing and basket weaving at BCC

[01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:29.810]
Oh they love us over there at BCC, like I said, what a great institution of higher learning

[01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:33.450]
They got the best damn basket weaving class in America

[01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:35.790]
Wind surfing's getting up there too, pretty good

[01:32:37.890 --> 01:32:42.010]
It blows, 5,670560, pound 560 on the mobile

[01:32:42.010 --> 01:32:47.730]
I'm just, you know something, I'll just sit here and just let the adrenaline kind of like run out of my body now

[01:32:47.730 --> 01:32:50.870]
After that tremendous rush I just had from that facts

[01:32:52.930 --> 01:32:53.290]
Wooo

[01:32:53.850 --> 01:32:55.150]
Here's Delray B, chill out

[01:32:55.150 --> 01:32:56.170]
Hi Neil, yes sir

[01:32:56.170 --> 01:32:57.450]
I have a Spire Report on our Goldstein

[01:32:57.450 --> 01:32:57.910]
Yes

[01:32:58.790 --> 01:33:02.170]
First of all, they came out there and he sat on the chair, it looked like he's smuggling a water bit

[01:33:02.170 --> 01:33:08.750]
And he went, first of all he admits that he smokes pot in a hash all that he was in Amsterdam

[01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:11.530]
And he blew, Carlos bought ready to stop the show then

[01:33:11.530 --> 01:33:11.950]
Why?

[01:33:12.370 --> 01:33:13.050]
I don't know, I don't know

[01:33:13.050 --> 01:33:16.830]
I don't know, but it gets better because he tries to plug his magazine and I couldn't believe it

[01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:18.690]
They bleep out, screw

[01:33:19.250 --> 01:33:21.910]
And he goes, just please, everybody check out my website

[01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:27.930]
Oh my, wait wait, are you serious? In other words this man, I take back what I said about norm candus facts is pretty good

[01:33:27.930 --> 01:33:34.930]
I mean compared to this story because the only reason he went on with Howard and Conan was the shamelessly young school of megastonic

[01:33:34.930 --> 01:33:36.450]
It killed me, I couldn't believe it

[01:33:36.450 --> 01:33:42.230]
You see his big sat mouth go, screw.comyhere.com and I'm like oh my god

[01:33:42.230 --> 01:33:45.210]
W-W-W-W-Dot, mag.com

[01:33:45.210 --> 01:33:48.450]
Neil, I stayed up for this poor bastard because I just wanted to see what this guy looked like

[01:33:48.450 --> 01:33:52.830]
He matches the voice, everybody out there, the voice matches the face, what a mess

[01:33:52.830 --> 01:33:54.890]
Anyway, so then

[01:33:55.890 --> 01:33:57.030]
Yeah, I love you Neil

[01:33:57.030 --> 01:34:03.550]
Okay, get this then, he reaches over, he reaches over and he had his hand on his crotch I guess

[01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:04.150]
Right

[01:34:04.150 --> 01:34:08.310]
And he had his own hand on his crotch

[01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:09.410]
Oh, it's a cover word, yeah

[01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:14.250]
He had a big cigar on one hand and he reaches over for the other cigar and he had a Conan chump, he flipped

[01:34:14.710 --> 01:34:16.650]
And then it was a mess

[01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:17.670]
I don't blame him

[01:34:17.670 --> 01:34:22.830]
Because that guy, you know, you do understand, he was not joking about that, that Alan is so desperate that anything that's alive

[01:34:22.830 --> 01:34:28.930]
Even little animals, I mean, he said I was, he goes I would like to perform more effects on you

[01:34:28.930 --> 01:34:32.870]
I mean, it's flat out on the show and by this time Conan is like, he doesn't know what's his thing

[01:34:33.290 --> 01:34:34.930]
He doesn't know what that held him

[01:34:34.930 --> 01:34:38.490]
And his little sidekick to work on the side just like oh my god

[01:34:38.490 --> 01:34:42.270]
Good, well deserved too by the way, but they bleeped out the screw magazine

[01:34:42.270 --> 01:34:43.790]
Oh my god

[01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:45.610]
I felt so sorry for him, and on top of this

[01:34:45.610 --> 01:34:48.870]
Too bad Alan didn't hold up to Dan Bed and Jerry's fish food, the Kennedy and everything

[01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:50.330]
You know what he held up? You know what he held up?

[01:34:50.710 --> 01:34:55.890]
Pulled out of his ten dollar brown leather jacket, it was so, I'm sorry, the guy is just a mess

[01:34:55.890 --> 01:35:01.210]
He picks out his, he pulls out his freaking New York City taxi cab license

[01:35:01.210 --> 01:35:01.710]
Yeah

[01:35:02.490 --> 01:35:03.590]
And he's part of that thing

[01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:06.990]
Okay, well, he had a good time pal, thank you, this guy is speechless

[01:35:06.990 --> 01:35:08.890]
And to date, club you more on

[01:35:10.130 --> 01:35:11.810]
5670560, but that's the second time we saw

[01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:12.070]
Roy

[01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:13.370]
Today, what the hell is he on?

[01:35:14.590 --> 01:35:16.750]
5670560, pound 560 on a mobile one line

[01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:19.870]
Well, he did get a little excited, I grabbed that black instrument we have over in the counter

[01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:22.390]
When Roy was in here this morning looking for some sky tape

[01:35:24.710 --> 01:35:29.370]
Here's a mobile in Miami, probably trying to tape up those blisters that keep recurring on OJ's hands

[01:35:29.770 --> 01:35:30.410]
Yes sir

[01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:30.950]
How are you?

[01:35:31.170 --> 01:35:31.670]
Pretty good

[01:35:31.670 --> 01:35:35.310]
Hey, can I talk about the podcast run over with an asshole here?

[01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:36.870]
Go right ahead sir, take all the time you want

[01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:40.470]
Actually, I've been meaning to tell you this, it happened a couple of years ago

[01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:43.450]
In fact, can you do a good job at it, we'll give you your own show to talk about this every day

[01:35:43.450 --> 01:35:44.270]
Oh, thanks a lot

[01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:49.450]
A couple of years ago I worked at a TV station and on the weekends and the sky calls up and he said

[01:35:50.650 --> 01:35:52.050]
Can I talk to my sister Linda?

[01:35:52.530 --> 01:35:54.350]
She had worked there and I said, well who's this?

[01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:58.630]
He said it's a poll, her brother Paul Paul Kraft, castronova

[01:35:58.630 --> 01:35:58.910]
Yeah

[01:35:58.910 --> 01:36:00.270]
And I was speechless

[01:36:00.850 --> 01:36:05.470]
And I said, without misconduct, I said, Neil wants you to stop stealing his material

[01:36:05.470 --> 01:36:06.850]
He says, who is this?

[01:36:07.450 --> 01:36:09.190]
And I told him what I was in that

[01:36:10.710 --> 01:36:14.250]
So, while we're waiting for his sister to come to the phone, I said, by the way, what do you think of Roy?

[01:36:14.250 --> 01:36:17.390]
Well, this was when Phil was relatively new

[01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:18.610]
What do you think of Phil Henry?

[01:36:18.970 --> 01:36:21.570]
He said, I think his act is tired and worn out

[01:36:21.570 --> 01:36:23.110]
Oh my God!

[01:36:23.530 --> 01:36:23.870]
Oh!

[01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:25.010]
I do!

[01:36:25.730 --> 01:36:28.850]
And then you have any idea how much of Phil's stuff that he is stolen?

[01:36:29.130 --> 01:36:33.110]
Well, I don't listen to him, I never did and I haven't seen him

[01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:35.770]
But I'm talking about back when Phil was here to make it even worse

[01:36:35.770 --> 01:36:39.270]
Well, that's what he told me and he was quite serious

[01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:41.630]
He said, I think it's a tired, worn out thing

[01:36:41.630 --> 01:36:50.530]
I think all of us in the industry are honored to be critiqued by such a great, honorous, honorous broadcaster is Paul Kraft and Nova

[01:36:50.530 --> 01:36:55.190]
Well, I haven't listened to him, I never have, I never will, and you're God

[01:36:55.190 --> 01:36:55.990]
Okay, I have everything

[01:36:56.990 --> 01:37:01.430]
And don't forget, all that collected, nothing like a good omelet, but too many that cholesterol kill you

[01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:02.530]
Can't think for sh**

[01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:10.770]
I've got no idea he's done

[01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:14.710]
And I think we can't pull this down

[01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:18.270]
I left a piece of...

[01:37:19.450 --> 01:37:22.230]
I've also pulled on this down, now

[01:37:22.230 --> 01:37:28.230]
But I'm a say, I'm a say, I'm a say again

[01:37:28.230 --> 01:37:28.910]
Oh!

[01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:32.890]
And I am done, I'm a say, I'm a say again

[01:37:32.890 --> 01:37:33.910]
Pull my gun out

[01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:35.570]
And she's there bring down

[01:37:43.470 --> 01:37:45.110]
I'm a good Christian.

[01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:49.190]
Everybody wants that to be a way.

[01:37:50.610 --> 01:37:52.290]
So this won't get done.

[01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:56.110]
So it's the end of A.

[01:38:17.410 --> 01:38:19.070]
Yeah, they're doing a global move on in TV.

[01:38:19.290 --> 01:38:20.650]
So it seems like we're a little bit distracted.

[01:38:22.010 --> 01:38:23.050]
It's 2015 at 5.

[01:38:23.090 --> 01:38:25.010]
60 WQ down to one call on the board.

[01:38:25.130 --> 01:38:26.590]
Hey, we were rolling along, singing the song.

[01:38:26.930 --> 01:38:28.910]
And it goes back to what I would say in the very beginning of the show.

[01:38:29.850 --> 01:38:32.230]
And that is that I consider it a given way these stupid dolphin tickets.

[01:38:32.450 --> 01:38:33.750]
And have these phones lit up for today.

[01:38:33.850 --> 01:38:34.130]
And look at that.

[01:38:34.130 --> 01:38:35.910]
And the one line we did have that's gone now anyway.

[01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:36.750]
No calls.

[01:38:37.530 --> 01:38:39.130]
Two hours and 15 minutes it took.

[01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:39.790]
And it calls.

[01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:40.830]
They're all gone.

[01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.650]
Everybody went.

[01:38:41.730 --> 01:38:42.210]
Bye-bye.

[01:38:42.410 --> 01:38:42.810]
See ya.

[01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:46.270]
And actually we've had a pretty name good show here today for two and a quarter hours.

[01:38:46.450 --> 01:38:48.090]
I would say an excellent show on a scale of 10.

[01:38:48.230 --> 01:38:49.330]
I give it about a nine and a half.

[01:38:49.330 --> 01:38:51.770]
I didn't know Paul Castro and over show, but nothing's perfect.

[01:38:52.170 --> 01:38:55.250]
We haven't used anybody else's material yet that we haven't get credit to.

[01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:56.690]
I'm pretty good for that.

[01:38:56.890 --> 01:38:59.330]
She won't think about me when I steal something from somebody else like.

[01:39:00.030 --> 01:39:02.090]
I'll tell them that's something we stole from their concerns.

[01:39:02.810 --> 01:39:04.010]
And we steal a lot from their concerns.

[01:39:04.210 --> 01:39:04.330]
No.

[01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:08.430]
And that's just payback for them playing that vocal song all those years that really originally belonged to us.

[01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:13.630]
But guys who blatantly steal stuff from other people and pretended it was their material in the first place.

[01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:16.770]
And yeah, we have vocal Brian comes up with a lot of great stuff.

[01:39:16.770 --> 01:39:20.310]
And I don't pretend that I wrote it and satellite comedy network and American comedy network.

[01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:23.370]
And I'm not ashamed to say that other very creative people made that funny stuff.

[01:39:23.370 --> 01:39:24.350]
And we use it on a show.

[01:39:25.410 --> 01:39:25.730]
Great.

[01:39:26.650 --> 01:39:27.350]
And we pay them.

[01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:28.890]
And we pay them for the right to do it.

[01:39:28.930 --> 01:39:29.310]
That's right.

[01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:33.030]
Because we don't have the wherewithal or the time or the if we had the ability.

[01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.630]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:39:33.790 --> 01:39:34.990]
We'd knock Paul Feet down his throat.

[01:39:35.530 --> 01:39:36.710]
In fact, we're sending what's his name.

[01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:37.310]
Roar!

[01:39:37.410 --> 01:39:38.770]
And he looks over there to do that tomorrow.

[01:39:39.490 --> 01:39:40.850]
Ticking on our good French co-grip.

[01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:44.630]
And just because she's making so much more money in one week than you'll ever see in your lifetime.

[01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:47.830]
Fatso, big shot, hockey maven.

[01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:53.730]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:39:54.710 --> 01:39:56.390]
Got those dolphins, same stickets, baby.

[01:39:56.530 --> 01:39:57.370]
How about that opener, huh?

[01:39:57.630 --> 01:39:58.030]
Any interest?

[01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.470]
No.

[01:39:58.630 --> 01:39:58.770]
Good.

[01:40:00.290 --> 01:40:02.970]
And Joe Castell never came back by the way for the rest of the tickets.

[01:40:02.970 --> 01:40:04.030]
He's got those jets, stickets.

[01:40:04.190 --> 01:40:07.690]
He's like, I guess he kind of slinked out of here real quick after he made that boo-boo.

[01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:10.770]
On the 98 degrees video, that was a bad boo-boo baby.

[01:40:11.050 --> 01:40:11.870]
It looked like a boo-boo.

[01:40:13.530 --> 01:40:15.470]
And there's a couple of boo-boo's right there too.

[01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:17.810]
A couple of jigger boo-boo's there also.

[01:40:18.370 --> 01:40:18.610]
Yeah.

[01:40:18.990 --> 01:40:19.390]
Oh well.

[01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:20.970]
There's something for everybody on there.

[01:40:21.190 --> 01:40:21.910]
What's wrong with that?

[01:40:22.670 --> 01:40:23.390]
Oh-ho-ho.

[01:40:23.930 --> 01:40:27.970]
Well, just as I was speaking, I'm happy to be some dark, complexed young ladies on there.

[01:40:28.290 --> 01:40:29.550]
Shaking their boobies, okay?

[01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:30.870]
They're jigger boobies.

[01:40:31.370 --> 01:40:32.430]
And what's wrong with that?

[01:40:34.250 --> 01:40:34.930]
Here's D'Areal.

[01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:35.250]
Hello.

[01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:37.530]
You're sharp as ever, Neil.

[01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:38.570]
Sharp as a monster, man.

[01:40:38.730 --> 01:40:39.750]
But I admit that they have an instant.

[01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:41.950]
And they smoke Griffith as the one that put me over the top.

[01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:43.770]
She gave me the courage to do this show today.

[01:40:43.930 --> 01:40:49.390]
Well, this is not going to listen to you at the day to day and even before that, it's just that you don't lose a step.

[01:40:49.530 --> 01:40:50.510]
You get better as time.

[01:40:50.530 --> 01:40:50.930]
That's right.

[01:40:51.090 --> 01:40:52.230]
Like an old wine.

[01:40:52.670 --> 01:40:53.030]
Incredible.

[01:40:53.210 --> 01:40:54.710]
A little wine-ing the queen, yeah.

[01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:56.170]
No giveaways.

[01:40:56.670 --> 01:40:57.030]
Absolutely.

[01:40:57.210 --> 01:40:59.470]
You know, that's not great we've been doing since I cut out the giveaways.

[01:40:59.650 --> 01:41:00.650]
Yeah, no chance.

[01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:00.750]

[01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:02.790]
Like some people think I'm smart, like Frado.

[01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:03.770]
I know what it's all about.

[01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:05.750]
And people calling out with their fake story.

[01:41:05.950 --> 01:41:06.470]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:07.310]
You know what that's called?

[01:41:07.410 --> 01:41:08.690]
It's called buying an easy show.

[01:41:08.810 --> 01:41:12.330]
Like when we used to give away those x-rated videos and give away these stupid ball game tickets.

[01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:13.630]
It's not interesting.

[01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:14.530]
Listening. It's pathetic.

[01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:15.330]
It's tragic.

[01:41:15.610 --> 01:41:16.230]
It is pathetic.

[01:41:16.590 --> 01:41:17.710]
And you know the people there.

[01:41:17.790 --> 01:41:20.390]
You know they're sucking up by the way they're talking and beating around the bush.

[01:41:20.570 --> 01:41:21.170]
But you know what they're doing.

[01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:21.650]
They're beating them all right.

[01:41:22.350 --> 01:41:22.670]
And...

[01:41:22.670 --> 01:41:24.070]
Especially when we used to give those videos to them.

[01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:28.050]
Kind of, you made me laugh when you, that lady earlier, she said she was testing the water.

[01:41:28.050 --> 01:41:29.190]
It's kind of puttin' her toe in the water.

[01:41:29.290 --> 01:41:30.670]
Oh, you could tell right off the bat.

[01:41:31.090 --> 01:41:33.070]
Because you know how many women we get calling this show.

[01:41:33.150 --> 01:41:36.410]
When I saw a woman on there, almost immediately after I mentioned about the dolphin.

[01:41:36.410 --> 01:41:38.710]
There was no doubt in my mind.

[01:41:38.710 --> 01:41:39.390]
Yeah, and I thought George...

[01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:39.750]
No, no, no.

[01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:45.610]
I thought George, if by some miracle you do give away no women allowed.

[01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:47.630]
Because they don't call you.

[01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:49.090]
They only call you when there's giveaway.

[01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:50.170]
When they want something perfect.

[01:41:50.410 --> 01:41:50.810]
Absolutely.

[01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:54.290]
And in addition to what's not going to they call me, they don't even admit they listen to this show.

[01:41:54.450 --> 01:41:55.630]
You know these diaries that they get.

[01:41:55.770 --> 01:41:58.850]
They put down there listening to life and their closet's sneaking listen to this show.

[01:41:59.110 --> 01:42:00.510]
Yeah, there's no way of presenting.

[01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:01.630]
Give me here prison bitch.

[01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:03.010]
I'm only listening to life.

[01:42:03.170 --> 01:42:04.230]
But can we hear prison bitch?

[01:42:04.770 --> 01:42:05.170]
Absolutely.

[01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:07.810]
And no interest in Marlon's or dolphins.

[01:42:08.050 --> 01:42:09.110]
I'm through with sports.

[01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:10.730]
I've turned a new leaf there.

[01:42:10.850 --> 01:42:12.370]
No more sports.

[01:42:12.530 --> 01:42:14.470]
It's basically a waste of my time.

[01:42:14.530 --> 01:42:14.850]
Exactly.

[01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:18.030]
And the dolphins have let me down for the last 20-some odd years in the Marlon.

[01:42:18.170 --> 01:42:20.930]
I want to say just one thing only about the dolphins.

[01:42:21.110 --> 01:42:25.550]
And that is that the big up that it built up this year is so gigantic and so...

[01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:27.490]
And those promos that they're running over with Jimmy.

[01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:28.810]
And I came here for one reason.

[01:42:29.110 --> 01:42:30.390]
And everybody's getting on this station.

[01:42:30.610 --> 01:42:31.350]
Oh, they're loaded.

[01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:32.030]
And they're this...

[01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:36.370]
I mean the hype is so great that if they don't call almost undefeated and certainly go very deep

[01:42:36.370 --> 01:42:39.930]
and probably to the big dance this year, these people are going to be psychotic.

[01:42:40.130 --> 01:42:44.130]
Well a lot of people are saying that it was four years in the U of M, four years in Dallas.

[01:42:44.410 --> 01:42:46.210]
And then now this is the fourth year with the dolphins.

[01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:49.930]
Trust me, there is no chance the dolphins are going to win this year.

[01:42:50.410 --> 01:42:52.190]
I'm less likely to be the Super Bowl.

[01:42:52.810 --> 01:42:54.790]
And I'm the most optimistic guy.

[01:42:55.010 --> 01:42:57.590]
But you know, you've got to know when to cut your losses short.

[01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:59.310]
Got to know when the fish in Cubs bait.

[01:42:59.650 --> 01:43:00.130]
All right, Neil.

[01:43:00.130 --> 01:43:00.890]
Have a great day.

[01:43:00.890 --> 01:43:05.450]
Hey, let me see anything by Brad the Booker Belmont would be good.

[01:43:05.490 --> 01:43:06.550]
All right, let me go.

[01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:08.390]
All right, let me go.

[01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:10.310]
Oh, I love that thing by the way.

[01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:11.530]
We haven't played that in a long time.

[01:43:11.530 --> 01:43:13.270]
Now that we gave somebody those...

[01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.790]
What is that called?

[01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:15.970]
What does that thing called?

[01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:16.890]
What are you talking about?

[01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:20.090]
The Brad the Booker Belmont, you think that's often the Buffalo fights on?

[01:43:20.370 --> 01:43:20.870]
Oh, it's the bills.

[01:43:21.170 --> 01:43:22.290]
Oh, I see I got the bills.

[01:43:22.490 --> 01:43:24.630]
The bills are off my list because nobody gave those tickets away.

[01:43:24.690 --> 01:43:25.490]
I don't want to say you've got them.

[01:43:26.050 --> 01:43:27.330]
That's what I want.

[01:43:27.490 --> 01:43:28.730]
I don't want to say a bill thing.

[01:43:28.730 --> 01:43:33.210]
That's what Buffalo has to put ball peeing the greatest in the land.

[01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:35.950]
Oh, and everybody thinks they're great.

[01:43:36.090 --> 01:43:37.450]
I say Billy, huh?

[01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:39.950]
The Buffalo Bill's not enough for what?

[01:43:40.190 --> 01:43:40.650]
See what I mean?

[01:43:41.290 --> 01:43:42.510]
So just sing along.

[01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:45.890]
When you say my amy, when you say Buffalo Super Bowl,

[01:43:45.970 --> 01:43:50.990]
and you're the Buffalo Bills, Buffalo Bills,

[01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:54.690]
the Santa Cranes team and the history of human race,

[01:43:54.690 --> 01:44:00.270]
Santa Buffalo Bills, the greatest in the city.

[01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:02.730]
Since life's spread and can be here.

[01:44:04.230 --> 01:44:05.450]
Yeah, there you go.

[01:44:05.890 --> 01:44:08.290]
And your chance up that redneck stuff,

[01:44:08.430 --> 01:44:09.570]
they look at that banjo.

[01:44:10.170 --> 01:44:11.970]
Holy sweet God, listen to that.

[01:44:12.290 --> 01:44:13.630]
When you say Buffalo Bills,

[01:44:13.710 --> 01:44:15.550]
you don't sound so redneck, you do it.

[01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:18.750]
Everybody sing along now.

[01:44:19.090 --> 01:44:19.850]
Are you a bill fan?

[01:44:20.150 --> 01:44:20.610]
Here we go.

[01:44:22.750 --> 01:44:24.910]
Where's the Buffalo Bills and the best team?

[01:44:25.230 --> 01:44:27.210]
They have the best record over the last five years.

[01:44:27.450 --> 01:44:29.590]
And they went to the Super Bowl four times,

[01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:31.610]
which is what I can say for this scum circumcision.

[01:44:32.430 --> 01:44:33.530]
And they're at the greatest.

[01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:35.810]
Like they really like their uniforms.

[01:44:36.210 --> 01:44:39.770]
They share his hellbeat that heck out of having a fish on the helmet.

[01:44:39.930 --> 01:44:42.670]
That's the standard Buffalo whole bills.

[01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:46.470]
The best football team, what I ever seen,

[01:44:46.750 --> 01:44:49.150]
in the history of my life they ought to.

[01:44:49.150 --> 01:44:53.310]
Buffalo Bills, that's Buffalo Bills.

[01:44:53.690 --> 01:44:56.370]
The whole of Jim Kelly, the greatest quarter back of the league.

[01:44:57.430 --> 01:45:00.070]
Yeah, everybody that's Buffalo Bills.

[01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:01.910]
They're the Buffalo Bills.

[01:45:02.710 --> 01:45:03.470]
And they've been around,

[01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:05.810]
longer than the stinking rotten fish.

[01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:08.630]
Well, they're the Buffalo Bills.

[01:45:09.150 --> 01:45:12.510]
Buffalo Bills, what would you rather have as a pet,

[01:45:12.510 --> 01:45:13.590]
a Buffalo or a fish?

[01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:14.990]
You know, I'm just playing that,

[01:45:15.010 --> 01:45:17.350]
and I think of that comment that allegedly cast it over made.

[01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:19.090]
And I had the reason to make it up either.

[01:45:20.110 --> 01:45:22.370]
That Phil's act was old and tired and stable.

[01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:22.950]
I don't know what he said.

[01:45:23.230 --> 01:45:26.970]
I mean, Phil Henry's got more talent in the fingernail of his tiny little finger.

[01:45:27.290 --> 01:45:29.910]
The nail on his, the little toe on whichever foot.

[01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:33.050]
The mat man has gotten his big, putsy body.

[01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:36.570]
Here's your guy that has never had anything original in his life.

[01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:38.210]
Even the air that he breathed,

[01:45:38.230 --> 01:45:40.630]
it's pre-breed, somebody else tried it before he did it.

[01:45:41.610 --> 01:45:42.910]
That's how unoriginal he is.

[01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:44.390]
And he's taking shots at Phil Henry.

[01:45:45.390 --> 01:45:48.650]
And Phil Griffin, who makes more money in four seconds than he does in a lifetime.

[01:45:50.150 --> 01:45:50.930]
I'm not jealous.

[01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:53.510]
I just wish, like I said, I would have gotten a little piece of the action,

[01:45:53.610 --> 01:45:54.390]
but more power to her.

[01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:55.210]
Phil Griffin.

[01:45:56.870 --> 01:46:00.110]
5, 6, 7, 0, see, she's got two things that you don't have, Paul.

[01:46:00.430 --> 01:46:02.510]
One is a lot of money, and two is a sense of humor.

[01:46:04.530 --> 01:46:05.890]
Here's a mobile and Hollywood. Hello.

[01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.790]
Mobile and Hollywood.

[01:46:09.130 --> 01:46:09.670]
Hi, Neil.

[01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:10.210]
Yes, sir.

[01:46:10.690 --> 01:46:12.490]
Oh, I'm coming to give you a nice little pig report.

[01:46:13.170 --> 01:46:14.690]
East of University on task.

[01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:18.070]
You've got two of them sitting there just picking us out of the water, man.

[01:46:18.210 --> 01:46:20.530]
Just bus to be going 25 over the speed limit.

[01:46:21.890 --> 01:46:24.150]
So that's going to cost me a nice little pretty penny now.

[01:46:24.270 --> 01:46:25.850]
I've got to shell out to them again, then.

[01:46:26.450 --> 01:46:27.330]
So I'll let you guys know.

[01:46:27.390 --> 01:46:29.330]
Be careful out there, man. They're out there full force.

[01:46:29.470 --> 01:46:30.370]
Thanks for the good news, pal.

[01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:31.450]
All right, Neil. You take care.

[01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:33.990]
And watch out for those, those, those, uh, SWAT teams.

[01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:35.550]
That'll be next.

[01:46:35.670 --> 01:46:37.210]
They're going to have the SWAT teams when they got the, uh,

[01:46:37.210 --> 01:46:38.670]
the radar, the porkers out there.

[01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:41.770]
Then they'll have the SWAT teams come barreling in on you from all different directions.

[01:46:41.770 --> 01:46:45.370]
Oh, you were going 15 and a, uh, 13 or something like that.

[01:46:45.390 --> 01:46:46.550]
Some crap like that.

[01:46:46.930 --> 01:46:47.970]
Some bogus garbage.

[01:46:50.090 --> 01:46:53.790]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a mobile one line.

[01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:56.030]
The only show in America where the host can honestly say,

[01:46:56.170 --> 01:46:58.930]
I stole a goddamn free train and I'm proud of it.

[01:46:59.070 --> 01:47:00.850]
I make no apologies for it.

[01:47:01.890 --> 01:47:03.110]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[01:47:03.530 --> 01:47:04.470]
Hey, Neil. How you doing?

[01:47:04.530 --> 01:47:05.010]
Pretty good, sir.

[01:47:05.570 --> 01:47:09.290]
Hey, uh, I can't believe those two cowards that they hung the phone up like that.

[01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:12.850]
Did you see that when they started getting a little heated and they had nothing to say back to her?

[01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:16.110]
That kid, that punk they called before that said something about boating a sparser,

[01:47:16.110 --> 01:47:16.830]
which he don't know is you.

[01:47:16.930 --> 01:47:19.810]
Did she, uh, he gave one version of the story, but I don't know.

[01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:22.010]
It sounded to me like they hung up on them because they said,

[01:47:22.170 --> 01:47:24.170]
oh, they're gone and we heard the click.

[01:47:24.850 --> 01:47:27.530]
That's, yeah, I heard your tape that you played and it sounded like me.

[01:47:27.530 --> 01:47:29.430]
You're like, were they going to have time to doctor the tape?

[01:47:29.530 --> 01:47:30.290]
Is that what it's all about?

[01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:31.370]
How would they doctor the tape?

[01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:33.930]
It sounded like they doubted, but, uh, unbelievable.

[01:47:34.110 --> 01:47:36.450]
You know, it really cracked me up as, uh, Rambrawer on there.

[01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:40.130]
He, uh, you know, I, I listened once in a while and, uh,

[01:47:40.670 --> 01:47:44.370]
the guys is starting to suddenly keep, uh, so morally correct on every issue that is,

[01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:45.510]
you know, brought to attention.

[01:47:45.710 --> 01:47:48.070]
Like I said, just like Jim Reiner, real goody two shoes.

[01:47:48.190 --> 01:47:51.770]
And you know something, if I'm on Zeta, the last thing I want to do is put somebody on here

[01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:54.990]
that's a goody two shoes because the people who are listening to that radio station

[01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:59.010]
aren't interested in somebody who's supposedly politically correct and sucks the mayor's fat butt.

[01:47:59.130 --> 01:48:00.010]
I'll tell you that right now.

[01:48:00.130 --> 01:48:00.470]
Exactly.

[01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:01.510]
I mean, look at the listeners.

[01:48:01.690 --> 01:48:03.250]
Most of those listeners, what do they talk about?

[01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:04.510]
Drinking beer, smoking pop.

[01:48:04.690 --> 01:48:04.850]
Right.

[01:48:04.850 --> 01:48:05.350]
You know, you're not wrong with that.

[01:48:05.410 --> 01:48:06.310]
You're not laid, that's right.

[01:48:06.490 --> 01:48:07.450]
Yeah, that's not wrong with that.

[01:48:07.530 --> 01:48:10.310]
But you know what, if you're gonna, if you're gonna go ahead and talk about that stuff and,

[01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:13.590]
and don't have a problem with that, you better have a couple DJs on there that,

[01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:15.530]
you know, support it and live that lifestyle.

[01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:20.390]
Because otherwise, this guy's trying to act like, uh, you, like above the rest of his listeners,

[01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:21.390]
which is ridiculous.

[01:48:22.030 --> 01:48:22.670]
Let's try that on track.

[01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:26.490]
Also, I mean, and then it would really upset me, it was a couple days ago,

[01:48:26.650 --> 01:48:28.550]
it was actually two days ago with the, uh, the teachers.

[01:48:29.010 --> 01:48:30.850]
He's sitting there saying those teachers should be fired.

[01:48:31.470 --> 01:48:31.670]
Yeah.

[01:48:31.670 --> 01:48:33.530]
We have, we have spy reports on that.

[01:48:33.630 --> 01:48:36.450]
And by the way, Evan, I don't need a brown school board, isn't so sure they're not listening

[01:48:36.450 --> 01:48:40.490]
to Paul because it says here in the paper this morning, school board reconsideres the vote.

[01:48:40.710 --> 01:48:43.730]
And they're gonna take some time and look at this again because, uh, they're coming to their

[01:48:43.730 --> 01:48:45.870]
census now and realizing that they know their business.

[01:48:46.370 --> 01:48:47.070]
Yeah, I mean, exactly.

[01:48:47.150 --> 01:48:49.110]
This is, these people's private lives, okay?

[01:48:49.630 --> 01:48:52.790]
And, and for, I mean, Paul Castro, but wasn't as much of, you know,

[01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:54.330]
wasn't as critical as Ron Boer was.

[01:48:54.430 --> 01:48:58.550]
Ron Boer was saying, oh, you know, these, these, you know, that's, I don't want them to be my kids

[01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:59.210]
and this and that.

[01:48:59.210 --> 01:49:01.950]
I mean, who knows what this guy does this person like?

[01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:07.070]
Ron Boer needs to be fixed immediately to just to make sure he don't reproduce anymore

[01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.990]
if he already knows.

[01:49:08.110 --> 01:49:09.270]
Who is he to be judge and jury?

[01:49:09.650 --> 01:49:09.650]

[01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:12.350]
I, uh, I have to say, those guys are a joke.

[01:49:12.510 --> 01:49:12.930]
They really are.

[01:49:12.930 --> 01:49:13.830]
Okay, great day, pal.

[01:49:14.430 --> 01:49:18.890]
Well, thank God we can't be all good Puritans like Ron Boer and Paul Castro and Oval.

[01:49:19.010 --> 01:49:21.170]
We can't be all real good, goody-touches.

[01:49:21.250 --> 01:49:23.390]
I sure know that an old pervert like me.

[01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:25.210]
And proud of it.

[01:49:26.210 --> 01:49:28.090]
Sammy, get it, suck.

[01:49:34.210 --> 01:49:37.970]
Bill's the cause Monica's a China.

[01:49:40.090 --> 01:49:42.650]
She lets out a giggle.

[01:49:43.710 --> 01:49:51.910]
When he makes it we go, Monica is not the kind you can do in the behind.

[01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:56.810]
But a cigar and herb are China, she's all mine.

[01:49:58.810 --> 01:50:02.090]
Well, he don't know where a stovey goes.

[01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:09.250]
I can see how there was some confusion between humor, door and human horror.

[01:50:09.450 --> 01:50:09.710]
Yes.

[01:50:11.450 --> 01:50:14.590]
And then, I can start the term Cedar Box.

[01:50:15.050 --> 01:50:21.850]
Means, all her naked stars report you need to go in line.

[01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:23.190]
Squared, squirt.

[01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:54.650]
I'm not a good, good, good, good.

[01:51:02.630 --> 01:51:05.810]
I'm not a good, good, good, good.

[01:51:05.810 --> 01:51:05.810]

[01:51:05.810 --> 01:51:05.870]
I'm not a good, good, good, good.

[01:51:05.870 --> 01:51:08.610]
I'm not a good, good, good.

[01:51:08.610 --> 01:51:08.610]

[01:51:08.610 --> 01:51:08.610]

[01:51:08.610 --> 01:51:08.610]

[01:51:08.610 --> 01:51:10.030]
I'm not a good, good, good.

[01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:11.370]
I'm not a good, good, good.

[01:51:11.370 --> 01:51:13.150]
I'm not a good, good, good.

[01:51:13.210 --> 01:51:17.910]
I'm not a good, good.

[01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:19.270]
I'm not a good, good.

[01:51:19.270 --> 01:51:19.710]

[01:55:38.730 --> 01:55:39.790]
the matter of public record

[01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:44.630]

[01:56:07.190 --> 01:56:11.690]

they're very lucky here's a mobile in four-lotterdale hello hello yes sir i just want to respond to

[02:00:40.210 --> 02:00:45.610]
that call it and made a statement saying that all people that listen to rock and roll basically are

[02:00:45.610 --> 02:00:50.470]
pot heads and drunks i mean he know he didn't say that he's talking about the people that listen to

[02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:56.850]
zeta a lot of him smoke weed and our uh whatever little more stereotype and to me i mean because i

[02:00:56.850 --> 02:01:01.410]
listen to rock and roll and zeta most of the time yeah and you know i don't do that sort of thing and

[02:01:01.410 --> 02:01:06.570]
i just like rock and roll and that's why people get off on a stereotype in a different ethnic groups

[02:01:06.570 --> 02:01:11.650]
and everything to with ethnic groups that has to do with people like a certain kind of music and

[02:01:11.650 --> 02:01:15.790]
no they're not all the same and they don't all look the same and smell the same and eat the same

[02:01:15.790 --> 02:01:19.810]
food and dress the same but i think generally speaking the guy had a point and that is that if

[02:01:19.810 --> 02:01:23.150]
you're listening to that kind of music you're not looking to have somebody come out of here to

[02:01:23.150 --> 02:01:28.530]
moralize for you and to give you a sermon every day well no no run does get off on a tie horse every

[02:01:28.530 --> 02:01:34.090]
now and then and you know but paul doesn't generally he just you know he's a jerk off really sounds

[02:01:44.290 --> 02:01:48.550]
want to get off my chest because i think that's where this country gets off you know they start

[02:01:49.410 --> 02:01:55.190]
you know putting people into categories just because they do certain things you know like all

[02:01:55.190 --> 02:01:59.990]
people that ride motorcycles of bad people right that's right people like rock and roll and with

[02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:03.010]

[02:02:03.010 --> 02:02:07.410]

[02:04:14.370 --> 02:04:18.810]
on what i don't watch the reking very rarely yeah because because you know jibral was being on his wife

[02:04:18.810 --> 02:04:23.410]

do you want me to say this come back and he treats he treats women like all too many people athletes

[02:04:27.850 --> 02:04:32.470]
and especially dark complex athletes treat women like like objects to be beaten and used and abused

[02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:37.530]
and that seems to be a very common theme especially with dark complex athletes but not exclusively

[02:04:37.530 --> 02:04:41.290]
that's what i want to hear you say what what is the problem this is nothing new with him he's been

she pulled up her dress and she showed them her rumbles and leases and white fluffy dung

[02:19:49.570 --> 02:19:56.370]
she said she was learning a new way to bring up her children so they would not spend

[02:19:56.370 --> 02:20:03.250]
while the boys in the barnyard were shoveling raps you send later thrown yesterday time

[02:20:03.250 --> 02:20:09.950]
while the girl in the middle was rubbing her eye to the fellow down by the dock

[02:38:54.170 --> 02:38:57.730]
of writing the review and I guess the religious editor is one of those guys who's in the doctor

[02:38:57.730 --> 02:39:01.570]

that I have ever read in other words without any of the phony baloney an objective look which are

[02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:27.450]
amazing yeah the only thing that I really wish was he had foot noted a lot of his quotes more

[02:39:27.450 --> 02:39:31.570]
is biblical references because I had no idea where some of these references were coming from and

[02:39:31.570 --> 02:39:35.890]
I'd like to go back and look at them in you know forse wise you know what I mean maybe look

[02:39:35.890 --> 02:39:39.990]

[02:40:34.310 --> 02:40:39.070]
again and again because it makes a lot of sense stop giving you money to a bunch of fakers in fact

[02:40:39.070 --> 02:40:42.950]
I'll tell you one thing if I had to choose at least I'd rather give my money to the psychic hotline

[02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:47.250]
and 12 Griffin and Shirley tweeders and those other whoever they are on their old bags I'd rather

[02:40:47.250 --> 02:40:50.470]
give my money to them I don't want to give it to either one but if I had to choose if I had my

[02:40:50.470 --> 02:40:54.730]
brothers I'd rather give it to them because at least they're entertaining in a very bizarre and

[02:40:54.730 --> 02:41:00.830]
perverse way although so is the church but mostly in just a perverse way only in the banana

[02:41:00.830 --> 02:41:02.930]

[02:41:22.090 --> 02:41:25.930]

[02:41:26.610 --> 02:41:33.970]

[02:41:33.970 --> 02:41:41.890]
ate all this drug now I'm afraid to see but it might feel something disgusting running down my knees

[02:41:41.890 --> 02:41:47.430]
well I should have seen that more than that they put on the bag and I should have been suspicious

good time and enjoy the good things the best they're always looking for some kind of a problem
