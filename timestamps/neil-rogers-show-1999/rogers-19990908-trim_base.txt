[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080]
6th degree of movement for this.

[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:07.360]
Sports Radio 560W 2AM Miami Fort Lauderdale presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.800]
I'm talking Neil, called 5600560, call free for David Brower, or pound 560 on your cell phone.

[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:24.400]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers, or anyone else on the show do not necessarily reflect those of WQAM easily read acquisitions or the easily broadcast group.

[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.660]
Now, Neil Rogers on Sports Radio 560QAM.

[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.940]
Oh my god!

[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.100]
George he pushed that his nose is clean and never put the pin in.

[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.320]
Cunty's running for the White House, so he took Canada's nidus.

[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.860]
Stone drunk and that's not all even down the beauty ball.

[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.980]
Paul and Cunty's drug would do, he'd even drop some medicine too.

[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.820]
Why won't George get come out and simply say he did it?

[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.200]
He preferred the press would shut their mouth.

[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.900]
But if some of your got them business.

[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.780]
He did more than what you think.

[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.980]
But he watched it down the sea.

[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.940]
And he preferred cocaine to hash.

[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.120]
That's the question that he does.

[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.260]
And he made his point much clearer.

[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.440]
Like a razor on a mirror.

[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.120]
But he wants us to believe.

[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.320]
That he didn't do anything.

[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.260]
George he pushed that his nose is clean and never put the pin in Cunty's running for the White House.

[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.500]
So he just passed it.

[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.960]
Man, George he's clean, George he's clean, George he's clean.

[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.900]
Oh oh oh oh.

[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.280]
Right.

[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.500]
Alright, 10-1 at 5-60 WQM.

[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.580]
Happy your Wednesday to you.

[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.260]
What a great day.

[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.400]
This has turned into, huh?

[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.980]
And about 30 seconds there.

[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.880]
Just in the next time, although I don't want to let Tracy neatly off the hook.

[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.800]
I want to rip her an ass.

[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.780]
Please don't.

[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.360]
Why not?

[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.360]
She did her best.

[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.440]
That's only what she did.

[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.540]

[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.280]
That's an old adage that I just made up.

[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.960]
Okay?

[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.680]
And it is don't promise things that you cannot deliver.

[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.080]
She didn't exactly promise.

[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.080]
That how she didn't.

[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.660]
The words were no problem.

[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.400]
Unless you distorted her message.

[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.300]
We're talking about backstreet boys tickets by the way for next week at the Mac Arena.

[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.100]
And see that woman in Bocats, a good thing she sent me that apology letter.

[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.120]
Thank you very much sweetheart for sending me the apology letter because otherwise I'd have ripped your ass again.

[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.560]
In fact, I might just do it anyway.

[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.780]
The one that sent me that gushing letter sucking around, sucking around about three weeks ago.

[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:26.640]
And then at the end of the letter, oh, and by the way, my daughter and I and my sister-in-law and every other bitch here that we know we'd love to get some backstreet boys tickets from you.

[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.980]
As if I have like I got tickets people think I got tickets in my rectum.

[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.920]
You know, I don't know what it is like that guy in four miles yesterday that had a hot dog in his rectum.

[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.080]
People just reach in there and pull all kinds of crap, I guess.

[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.580]
No tickets in my rectum or anyplace else.

[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.560]
So I get the bad news from George this morning that Tracy Neely, who is allegedly such a big fan of mine and such a big you know Tracy Neely,

[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.280]
it works for some of the record companies that send us all those crappy CDs that we never want.

[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.980]
That we used to waste a lot of time on a show giving away.

[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.140]
Which by the way, there's a rumor that George gave away a bunch of beer on the show one day, but it's just a rumor.

[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.780]
A lot of bunch of calls by giving beer away on the show.

[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.060]
I thought we didn't give stuff away anymore.

[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.320]
It was a labor day.

[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.340]
No, it was not labor day.

[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.880]
Labor day was a Monday.

[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.400]
It gave me a way on Friday for the labor day tickets to the Gringo.

[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.520]
What do you mean to the Gringo?

[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.060]
It was by a Gringo of beer day.

[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.840]
Are you going to start with that Cuban crap again this morning?

[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.060]
It's three minutes after the hour and already you're starting with Cuban crap.

[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.320]
No, I'm not.

[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.700]
I'm not.

[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.040]
I'm not.

[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.260]

[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.400]
I'm not.

[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.060]
I'm not.

[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.680]
I'm not.

[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.160]
I'm not talking about this orate verkiette.

[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.160]

[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.160]

[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.160]

[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.160]

[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.720]
hat a thick hamburger right now.

[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.640]
This new thing you know with the where Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin and all of these other non-towards and micias.

[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.780]
And I watched them by 40 minutes.

[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.800]
at least Miguel by the way never got a mention.

[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.880]
NEVER got a mention that I saw I didn't see the last 20 minutes, but I have my doubts that even never got a mention.

[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.740]
and you want to know why because he doesn't speak in england he doesn't sing

[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.320]
an anguish

[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.540]
what is it and yesterday and for about five words and it everybody laughed

[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.220]
them off the stage

[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.000]
but it anyway so guess who they spent most of the time on act not Ricky Martin

[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.640]
not and reekay although there was plenty on and reekate

[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.900]
and uh... and the Jennifer Lopez

[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.420]
but mark anthony

[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.680]
you know who that is

[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.040]
you don't even know what it is named but let me just tell you one thing about

[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.780]
mark anthony

[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.340]
it can't think for sure exactly

[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.180]
okay

[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.560]
he don't look good he doesn't sing good he uh...

[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.740]
but other than that he's great

[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.180]
and he crossed over he crossed races and he crossed over

[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.920]
no it's ricky martin that crossed dresses this guy crossed over

[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.160]
and how he sings both an esponial and in the english and how he's bigger than

[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.220]
uh... wonder bread

[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.340]
so supposedly

[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.800]
can't sing a lick can't think for sure exactly

[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.020]
he's he's grotesque

[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.800]
he he couldn't lick

[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.260]
just the tiniest spot on either cheek of louis McGill that's how bad

[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.040]
this guy is

[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.180]
but this is the hype now baby everything is hype

[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.020]
abc a whole hour special i just discovered and then this mamba number five

[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.540]
piece of crap that they keep uh... you know that either you know i'm gonna tell

[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.100]
you forgot that pretend don't know about music

[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.900]
it's not it's not pick it's main the mamba

[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.240]
now it's main stream it's big

[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.180]
mamba number five

[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.700]
which thank god it's the kind of came in what very rapidly was like uh... you

[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.940]
know like a bad rash that goes away in a couple days

[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.100]
mamba number five

[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.240]
so anyway great read comes in here about ten minutes before the hour

[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.300]
with his usual sense of humor going like that

[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.920]
so i guess you must have already mentioned to him the fact that i was that

[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.280]
but you know that's what he came rushing in here but i knew it had nothing to do

[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.760]
with radio

[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.700]
but you know something

[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.940]
screw that okay anybody can uh... diddle with radio

[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.200]
what's important for the book with bob green did he have anything to do with

[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.440]
radio that he got me those damn panther tickets

[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.960]
he's the one that said the president getting the panther season tickets remember

[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.240]
that

[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.480]
as a gift

[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.700]
just because they knew that they were underpaying me and getting me real cheap

[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.440]
that's right

[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.100]
so that was a way of uh... you know that they're gonna screw me anyway or at least

[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.620]
so they thought

[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.140]
thanks very much by the way bob niel

[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.200]
and all you other figures all you go up there in Atlanta thank you so much

[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.300]
because we're working at the best goddamn radio station in america right now

[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.440]
about eight minutes ago i would have said quite the opposite

[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.100]
in fact great statement the embarrassment talking about this article about radio

[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.320]
exit nobisath easing where they got in i showed him the picture i said look at

[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.940]
that they got better equipment than we do at a college station

[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.980]
that shares that frequency with pipe or high with kpx

[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.840]
kpx is seven a m to seven p.m. and uh... nobisath easing seven p.m. to seven in the

[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.500]
morning and plan a hell of a lot better music than power ninety six by the way

[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.020]
or anybody else on fm in the market

[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.080]
so i'm told

[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.320]
although based on you know your musical taste

[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.160]
you just on a word that's the problem you just unaware of what's going on in

[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.440]
music

[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.660]
helping you not know my mom and how can you not know mark and then

[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.500]

[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.260]
bought pop

[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.240]
mark and then he

[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.340]
yeah no statement by that stuff all here we go with that again back with the

[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.500]
first it was the human thing and i was back to his homophobia again

[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.940]
just like i said yesterday next to the picking on a jews again and will have

[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.820]

[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.260]
air ups over there

[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.880]

[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.340]
just worry about the desert and vagus okay like i said

[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.260]

[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.700]

[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.900]
anything about all this hot music momo number five

[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.560]
like i said just before vacation got eighty billion who knows out there in

[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.260]
this audience the most useless i mean just just like a uh... wet dish rag

[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.380]
that's the impact of our holy all i mean that it's the extent of their input

[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.340]
when you got something really hot like this so anyway Greg read comes in and

[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:26.440]
says he's got me front row tickets for the backstreet boys concert next week

[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.980]
out there's a guy okay Greg read

[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.680]
not too good on a radio part of it but uh... not too good on getting people

[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.680]
paid on time nevertheless if you wait long enough if you live long enough if

[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.680]
you're a survivor you'll eventually get the cash and the check might clear

[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.360]
someday but those are on important things the important thing is backstreet

[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.840]
boys front row seats for next week so there you go crazy nearly okay you failed

[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.120]

[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.280]
A-B-C ten o'clock and I think I have another show on the Polish crossover music.

[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.120]
It's ten fifteen at five sixty WQA.

[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.960]
So speaking of music, anybody...

[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.200]
And I don't know when I'm asking these questions because it's obvious that I've had a really

[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.420]
the wrong court here today, no question about that.

[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.960]
They wouldn't know Mark Anthony from Mark Anthony.

[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.640]
I'm telling you right now, they don't,

[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.940]
they haven't got a clue who that is.

[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.260]
They wouldn't know Marcus Biggest Dickis

[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.920]
from what's his name, Marcus Aurelia.

[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.740]
So anyway, Radio X at the Nova South Eastern University,

[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.240]
student run station, they got a picture

[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.100]
in a community news section in a scum set

[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:27.540]
in the morning.

[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.080]
And here's Colin or is that Colin?

[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.680]
Is there anybody named Colin anymore?

[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.680]
Is that like a British thing?

[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.680]
I think it's Irish.

[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.960]
It's called to know that's even worse.

[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.380]
Oh Jesus boy.

[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.660]
Oh, he is wearing kilts by the way.

[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.640]
Colin Hurley and Derek Coffers.

[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.460]
So anyway, they're in the studio at Studio X

[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.060]
at whatever this radio station is in Nova South Eastern.

[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.440]
And I just happen to notice here

[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.000]
that they've got considerably better.

[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.420]
I mean, much better equipment than we got here at QIM,

[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.400]
including those really great mics

[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.540]
that we used to have like at IOD.

[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:56.960]
What are those?

[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:57.940]
These are electrovoys.

[00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.500]
These are okay.

[00:11:59.120 --> 00:11:59.860]
They're not bands.

[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.720]
And hizers we have.

[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.620]
Sennheises, yeah, very expensive microphones.

[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.260]
Very, I mean, they make even a guilty wood son

[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.300]
like a real man, huh?

[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.540]
Yeah, I'm serious.

[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.620]
I'll actually yell these that a deep,

[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.440]
a basic voice.

[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.420]
It's just those crappy microphones

[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.540]
that make them sound like that.

[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.980]
Oh, it's speaking to the worst team.

[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:14.740]
I'm all over the place,

[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.520]
but obviously it's gonna have a lot of time to speak today.

[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.260]
So seriously, I've never seen the first thing I said to George

[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.120]
when I walked in this morning.

[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.100]
I have never witnessed in my life such a rapid deterioration

[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.760]
of a human being as beefhole.

[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.040]
We're gonna be showing you the beefhole and after pictures.

[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.460]
And you're gonna be holding your head in your hands

[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.380]
and crying a lot too.

[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.400]
I just, I have never seen anyone.

[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.880]
I've known this guy for years now.

[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.140]
Worked with him at IOD for a long, long time.

[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.340]
And you know, he was always kind of a,

[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.120]
he was always the same.

[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.300]
You saw him on television and all those marginal shows

[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.560]
the dog racing show, the highlight show,

[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.880]
the sunshine show, the sports channel show,

[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.160]
which he's still doing those things.

[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.820]
And he always looked the same.

[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.380]
And then he came over here with the sports nerd crowd.

[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.860]
And all of a sudden, man, this guy,

[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.360]
I mean, I know he likes a, a, a proper tune now and end, you know?

[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.280]
Or three or four or five or six?

[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.400]
What wouldn't you have had a rocky meridz

[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.120]
like he has a line?

[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.820]
You know, it, maybe that's got something to do with it.

[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.260]
I don't know.

[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:14.980]
I don't wanna give a whole personal thing with it.

[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.840]
But I come in yesterday back from vacation

[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.820]
and saw beefhole in the hallway and man, bloodshot eyes.

[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.440]
This is, this is 845 in the morning yesterday.

[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.760]
We're not talking about 845 at night, 845 in the AM.

[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.360]
Red faced, you know?

[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:34.400]
and he's just gotten all the way to Hank lost, B.F.O. founded.

[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.300]
Like in a lump somewhere in a corner, they grabbed it.

[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.940]
Red face and it's like W.C. Fields.

[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.800]
Have you ever wondered what people who look like W.C. Fields looked like when they were younger?

[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.800]
In other words, how did the transition take place?

[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:56.220]
How did he come from whatever he looked like when it was dirty to what he looked like in the movies with a big bulb of snow?

[00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.540]
Now of course you mentioned the Irish in the Scottish before.

[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.300]
And like Ted Kennedy, there's another example.

[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.340]
Have you noticed him lately?

[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.780]
If you look like real close?

[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.560]
In other words, from 500 yards away or closer?

[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.500]
I mean every vein in his face is red now.

[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:18.100]
Every vein, every little cell is like, just stand out.

[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.240]
It protrudes red.

[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.120]
It's from all of that.

[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.780]
Booze is what it is.

[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.000]
It's an Irish thing.

[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.920]
The B.F.O. is the Irish by the way?

[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.080]
No.

[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.560]
So maybe it's now the Irish Jewish Chinese-wish?

[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:33.440]
Well, it's Polish?

[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.000]
I don't know.

[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.260]
So man, this guy is falling apart right in front of our eyes.

[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.240]
What are we going to do about him?

[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:38.960]
Can we save him?

[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.420]
You think, no.

[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:40.760]
Lost cause.

[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.420]
So anyway, anybody ever hear Radio X?

[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.560]
Now you said that you heard it.

[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.820]
They play really good music on there, which N.O.K.P.X plays great music during the daytime.

[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.380]
They actually have a better production value since their college.

[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.840]
They can pronounce a couple words.

[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.260]
You mean, let him do it in any spots on there?

[00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:58.580]
How about Tommy?

[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.280]
They got Tommy doing live spots on there?

[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.420]
He's the production director.

[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.320]
Poor Tommy.

[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.220]
Poor Tommy.

[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.500]
He was just a tear and his hair out by the roots this morning.

[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.940]
So no Mark Anthony calls, huh?

[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.280]
Nobody knows from Mark Anthony.

[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.160]
5.6705.60, pound 5.60 on a mobile one line.

[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.740]
Nobody cares about the Julio singers.

[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.560]
And you want to know why?

[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.100]
Cause I was doing this years ago.

[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.600]
Look at all the number of years ago.

[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.380]
As usual, how far ahead I am of this phony baloney so called mainstream?

[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:32.300]
Years ago that I was peddling Luis Miguel records in a sponule to rednecks.

[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.700]
Even in Tampa, they were going out to the records doors and buying Luis Miguel

[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.880]
because I was planted on here.

[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:44.000]
So as far as this Hispanic music explosion boys and girls, Uncle Neil was ahead of it by light years,

[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.560]
a billion years ahead of it with what's his name?

[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.820]
Their what's the little one with the always runner round with a shirt off?

[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.320]
Fabius said, dickess, what is his name?

[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.480]
Whatever Flavio Caesar.

[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:54.760]
All those guys.

[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:55.140]
Yeah.

[00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:00.880]
As usual way, way ahead of the mainstream and all these people are just catching up

[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.980]
with a guy like Marcus Anthony, whatever his name is, can't sing a lick, can't lick it.

[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.840]
At least in Rickey, you look at him and you know he can lick it.

[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.960]
Here's a mobile implantation.

[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:11.220]
Hello?

[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.280]
Uncle Neil.

[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:12.860]
Yes, sir.

[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.540]
I'm sorry, I was in a whole cat enough.

[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:22.460]
I went to eat panthers practice and the practice was closed in a public.

[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.320]
Sir, what are you talking about?

[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.600]
Are you listening to this show?

[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.420]
The Panthers.

[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.300]
Are you listening to this show, sir?

[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.480]
Is this the same guy that called at the beginning yesterday with your panther droppings?

[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.060]
Sorry, I just got back.

[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:38.680]
Yeah.

[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.640]
Why are we talking about the Panthers?

[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.460]
Is there something going on that I don't know about?

[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.940]
I thought you were Florida's biggest panther fan.

[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:47.680]
And?

[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:50.680]
And?

[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.000]
Well, just want to tell you that we saw them on Saturday.

[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.660]
They were doing the time.

[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.660]
Sir, let me ask you something.

[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.600]
What kind of a person goes to practice?

[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.500]
What happened to being Canada?

[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.140]
Sir, I go to Canada all the time.

[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.760]
I go to Canada all the time.

[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.220]
I'm sorry, I'm not a lot of happy, huh?

[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.220]
You're not going to haul, you're going to Toronto.

[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:12.760]
Yeah.

[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.380]
This was haul.

[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:16.100]
So what differences are making?

[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.600]
I guess there's not too much to do in haul, is there?

[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:21.960]
There's nothing to do in haul.

[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.780]
Well, I guess I know why I went to practice.

[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:25.960]
It was pretty interesting, actually.

[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:26.360]
Yeah.

[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.740]
We walked into players' entrance by accident.

[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:29.880]
We spoke to people.

[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.400]
It was unbelievable.

[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:31.800]
What's the matter?

[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.880]
Every, when I want to talk cocky, like when the season is going on,

[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.560]
I can't buy a call for $50,000.

[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.300]
But when I'm trying to talk about something important here,

[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.400]
like Marcus Dickis, whatever his name is,

[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.880]
you're telling me about the Panther practice and how long I'm the way wherever it was.

[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.460]
Okay, tell you, it just happened.

[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.280]
So what is there to tell us about Panther practice?

[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.440]
Let's hear it.

[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.500]
We walked in.

[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.340]
No, no, I don't want to hear what you walked in, you sat down.

[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.820]
What is it that you saw that would be of interest to us?

[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.800]
Well, first of all, the ambience of the arena is a totally different.

[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.760]
This arena was about 5,000.

[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.660]
You know, arena about 40 years old.

[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:12.120]
Just the old pictures on the wall, the old cocky plays was very interesting to see.

[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.060]
It feels totally different than the Miami arena in that area.

[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.320]
Well, how about Maple Leaf Gardens?

[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.340]
They're not playing there anymore, but it still feels different to walk in there

[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.580]
and see all the stuff on the walls.

[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.340]
It feels different.

[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.260]
What does that have to do with the Panther practice?

[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.580]
Well, Paul L'Burrow's getting around him.

[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.660]
He was doing the time skates.

[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:29.840]
He looked fantastic.

[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:30.260]
Yeah.

[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.500]
Not a problem in the world.

[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.120]
Trevor Tidd looks very good.

[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.060]
The goalie.

[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.180]
Looks very good, what?

[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:36.680]
In a suit?

[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.020]
Most skating around, react things.

[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.680]
Look, look, look, look, look, how can you tell if a goalie looks good skating around?

[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.980]
They're wearing all of those heavy up pads, all of that equipment.

[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.620]
What do you mean he didn't fall down?

[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.240]
Well, it's funny to see him skating around with all those pads, like you said.

[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.760]
You know, huffing and puffing.

[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.720]
But it was interesting.

[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.200]
Oh, God.

[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.820]
Please, I haven't even had a hard time.

[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.820]
I'm trying to help out here.

[00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.260]
Help me out with what?

[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.580]
With hockey talk?

[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.100]
He's such a big fan.

[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.800]
I thought you would find that interesting insight.

[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.900]
You also told us we were talking to a three-hour-

[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.800]
Well, you were talking about what?

[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.600]
What, in three?

[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.760]
I don't want to hear about Terry Murray.

[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.440]
He's an asshole.

[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.440]
The players all hate him.

[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.120]
I know all about Terry Murray, okay?

[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.940]
He looks sad and he was the insides group that everybody assigned.

[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.080]
He told us it's unsatisfied.

[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.320]
He gave you the insides, go blow him.

[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.780]
You're not listening to what I'm saying, sir.

[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.560]
He's an asshole.

[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.180]
The players will not play for him.

[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.480]
They hate him like poison.

[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.600]
Reef my lips.

[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.140]
It's okay.

[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.200]
It's last year, like I said.

[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:27.840]
They said it before.

[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:28.560]
Excellent.

[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.820]
Now you're starting to get to the good stuff.

[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.060]
Yeah, what's the matter?

[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.240]
Have a great day.

[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.820]
Oh, can you believe just like yesterday?

[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:38.740]
I come back from vacation.

[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:39.900]
It's hockey talk.

[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.520]
This guy was in Hall, I'm Terry, or whoever the hell is.

[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.520]
You know where the hell it is, Hall.

[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:45.540]
And I don't care.

[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:51.520]
I know Bobby Hall and Dennis Hall and Brett Hall and Warren Hall.

[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.140]
Anybody know Warren Hall?

[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:54.400]
No.

[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.140]
From Stracken Rich.

[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.500]
See, Mark Anthony, they don't know.

[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.120]
Hockey talk from Hall, Canada somewhere that he's watching the Panther practice, then he

[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:02.880]
knows like I care.

[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.440]
Is there anybody in this audience cares about that?

[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:04.640]
No.

[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:04.980]
No.

[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.240]
Even in the middle of the season, even in the height of the season, in the height of whatever

[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.860]
might be going on, if anything does go on this year, if Beret don't get injured, do

[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:13.820]
they care about hockey here?

[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:14.180]
No.

[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:18.440]
And this guy's calling me to give me a son of a dead breathless that he was in Hall, Ontario.

[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.540]
Watch as a Panther practice.

[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.060]
56670560, pound 560 on the mobile online.

[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.860]
Here's the mobile and pound beat.

[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.140]
Hello.

[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:30.780]
Meal.

[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.260]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:32.080]
How you doing?

[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.720]
I was calling last week.

[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:40.920]
George is doing a show and I wanted to find out what he finally ended up deciding on whether

[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.140]
he was going to do the swing thing or not.

[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.140]
So let me ask you something.

[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.680]
Are you listening to your radio today?

[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:47.660]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:51.680]
Are you talking about the swing that George wasted a whole week of the show talking about

[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.540]
again last week?

[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.860]
I was just trying to get the info from him.

[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.160]
Not the info about what?

[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.040]
To see what it was about.

[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.580]
I told him to have to wait till the next vacation.

[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:01.380]
Yeah.

[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.680]
Well, what differences have you made to you whether George goes there or not?

[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.960]
Well, what happened was I called last week and I was hoping to give him first hand experience

[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.020]
from it, but I was holding for so long and I ended up hanging up.

[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:13.600]
Yeah.

[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.500]
Well, I mean, George had a lot of calls last week.

[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.180]
That's a good sign.

[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.780]
I'm not getting any this week, but you know, it's a transition period.

[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.740]
Oh, so did he do it or not?

[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.060]
You'll have to wait till I go on vacation in November again and he'll tell you.

[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:25.800]

[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:26.720]
All right.

[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.780]
Okay, so don't crash, but so tight.

[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.340]
Okay, let it breathe a little bit.

[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:31.800]
Let's amoxygenate.

[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.420]
Well, you got these people whipped up with that swing crap.

[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.000]
I'll tell you that.

[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:40.940]
So I'm sorry that I mentioned about that Latin Vicholas, not about Mark Anthony and, yeah, I'm sorry.

[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.100]
And the mumbo number five and all this other crap.

[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:44.700]
Very sorry.

[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.320]
Let's do some hockey talk.

[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:46.700]
Okay.

[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.360]
Oh, come on.

[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.220]
No, seriously, that's what they want to talk about.

[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.960]
Berrier first call yesterday right out of the box, hockey call.

[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.460]
First call this morning, right out of the box, hockey call.

[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:54.920]
Hall.

[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:55.960]
I can call Rimmer.

[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:56.680]
Get him on the hotline.

[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.300]
1026 at 560 WQM.

[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.260]
I think I lost his number.

[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.040]
I have it.

[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.980]
Like I said, if you're smart.

[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:07.880]
Super God.

[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.140]
I have a hairy chest.

[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.440]
I have a hairy chest.

[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.700]
I have a hairy chest.

[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.640]
Real men have hairy chest.

[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.100]
I like to watch Baywatch.

[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.560]
I like to watch Baywatch.

[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.800]
I like to watch Baywatch.

[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.040]
Real men like to watch Baywatch.

[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.540]
I like to listen to Ricky Martin.

[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:22.000]
What?

[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.020]
I like to listen to Ricky Martin.

[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:24.860]
Hello.

[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.200]
Real men don't listen to Ricky Martin.

[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:29.620]
Sorry, pal.

[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:30.600]
I see.

[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.320]
Oh, I miss it.

[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.140]
I'm sorry, real men.

[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.700]
1040 at 560 WQM.

[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.480]
So, evidently, we're going to have to talk about swinging again until we can make a transition out of it.

[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:46.680]
Seriously, the only people that I got left listening now after the week that you did last week are the swinging crowd, which we know there's about what 80 of those is that what it is?

[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:47.520]
Oh, God.

[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.740]
They're all sitting out there.

[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.000]
They're squeezing it, waiting for the arrest of the story.

[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.180]
Here's the facts.

[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.400]
Dear Neil, usually I am waiting here the name on this facts by the way.

[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.340]
Usually I agree with you, but today I'm a little disappointed.

[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.440]
I can't believe you don't like Mark Anthony.

[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.380]
Do I like Mark Anthony?

[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:04.700]
No.

[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:05.280]
No, he sucks.

[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.680]
He has an incredible voice.

[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.160]
He does look like crap, but he can sing especially in Spanish.

[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.320]
You should listen to his older CDs, and I guarantee you you'll change your mind about it.

[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:16.480]
No.

[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:16.740]
No.

[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.940]
He is much better than Ricky and Ricky.

[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.160]
And Ricky, Krueger, Christian, what?

[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:23.100]
Castro.

[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.220]
And yes, better than Luis Miguel.

[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:26.380]
Oh, yeah.

[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.300]
Once again, Neil, give him a try.

[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:28.800]
Love.

[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.440]
W-I-W-I.

[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:30.820]
What is that?

[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:31.640]
Wewee is that high?

[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.720]
Love Wewee.

[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.700]
Or maybe that's a statement.

[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.680]
Love Wewee.

[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.600]
Oh, my God.

[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:38.640]
You have to be kidding me.

[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.280]
Mark Anthony, better than Luis Miguel.

[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.860]
I mean, this is laughable on the face of it.

[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.380]
It's a joke.

[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.080]
It's ridiculous.

[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.380]
Just another hype job, man.

[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.540]
A guy can't sing.

[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.240]
Looks like a turd burger.

[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.000]
He weighs about 80 pounds soak and wet.

[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.560]
Another 90s dynamite.

[00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:00.920]
And he's going out about, well, he got his inspiration from, you know, who the hell did they have on Ola Santana?

[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.620]
Which is a fiber here, Eddie, that Oyee Koma-Vag.

[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.540]
And I'm going to go from last time.

[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.440]
Don't, now, don't tell me you've got that.

[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.740]
Oh, Jesus Christ.

[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:11.980]
But by different people.

[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:12.440]
Wow.

[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:13.200]
Thank God.

[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.220]
And he's talking about his inspiration was watching Desi Arnez doing a Babalu on TV.

[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:18.960]
Babalu.

[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.020]
There you go.

[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.360]
That's the great Cuban conservation to music.

[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.160]
Babalu.

[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.900]
Get it out of here.

[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.320]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:27.580]
Hello.

[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:28.760]
Neil, how you doing, buddy?

[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:29.320]
Okay, sir.

[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:36.600]
And have you read that article on the health day, but discussing Christian fundamentalists trying to convert some of the Jews?

[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.440]
Yes, sir. I mentioned that.

[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.120]
Yes. Backdist are trying to convert the Jews. They're praying right now.

[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.520]
What's the reason for that?

[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.360]
Shouldn't they worry about getting their own members?

[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.480]
No, the reason for that is because, like, all fundamentalist Christians and, like, all fundamentalist religions of any kind,

[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.920]
they believe that their thing is to convert the world with their own sick, twisted religion.

[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.040]
God damn those Christians.

[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:56.540]
Exactly.

[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:57.240]
Bye.

[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:57.720]
Okay.

[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.240]
56670560.560 on a mobile online.

[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:11.320]
Like I said yesterday, anybody who would buy into any of this bull crap, anyway, needs serious help, needs a lobotomy immediate with not sooner, especially people like your good friend or your accountant that you're always defending.

[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:12.600]
Indefensible.

[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.660]
A crazy person.

[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.720]
A certifiable.

[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.520]
I don't care how good of an accountant he is.

[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.260]
A certifiable, crazy person.

[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.040]
What's the point?

[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.220]
My point is that people like that need to be, we need to be separated from them to save us from their insanity.

[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.720]
Comes in here twisting, he's laying it to fill in, and he's wrapping the, oh my god.

[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:30.900]
Crazy people.

[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.340]
56670560.560 on a mobile online.

[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.620]
Here's a mobile in the Miami.

[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:37.940]
Hello.

[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:39.780]
Hello.

[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:40.900]
Welcome to Swing Talk.

[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:41.380]
Yes, sir.

[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.440]
Yeah, a long time first time.

[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.100]
How you doing now?

[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:44.300]
Okay.

[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.160]
I'm going to Vegas at the end of this month.

[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:56.060]
And you've had mentions in your, in the past about a restaurant that is kind of hard to get in, but it's excellent.

[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.280]
It's hard to get in.

[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.240]
Yeah.

[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.520]
You said that it was a wonderful restaurant, but Rosewood Grill.

[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:02.800]
La Grill?

[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.140]
Rosewood Grill.

[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.240]
Okay.

[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.080]
It's not hard to get in.

[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.620]
It's not hard to get in.

[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.360]
No, because it's expensive as I'll get out.

[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.020]
Oh, what are they?

[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.200]
What's their specialties?

[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.700]
State, lobster, et cetera, you know?

[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.140]
Oh, lobster that's still.

[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:15.240]

[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.500]
I don't care about the price if they have good lobster.

[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.900]
Okay, well, that's the place for you right in the middle of the strip.

[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.260]
Okay, listen, thanks so much, Neil.

[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:22.940]
Have a great time.

[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:23.800]
Okay, bye bye.

[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.220]
And there's this dynamite McDonald's about two blocks down the road.

[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.100]
So what did Greg say about my back street boys tickets?

[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.540]
Okay, because this audience, they're indifferent.

[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:30.860]
I don't care about these people today.

[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:31.720]
They make me sick.

[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.020]
I'm so disgusted to eat back after 10 great days of vacation.

[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.340]
I come back to this the last day.

[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.860]
The total lack of respect.

[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.300]
Total lack of anything in this town.

[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.800]
So what did Greg say about those the back street boys tickets?

[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.840]
He was telling me that the exhaust fan is being installed even as we speak in the bathroom.

[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.440]
Oh, you know something?

[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:49.940]
I changed my mind about that.

[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.680]
Because I went in there to take a leak about 10 minutes before the show.

[00:26:53.360 --> 00:27:00.100]
You know, I mean, I realized that we can't all control our bodily aromas at all times.

[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:07.160]
But I have never worked in a radio station in my life where there were as many people who've got really smelly BN problems.

[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.940]
I'm talking, I mean, Josh Friedman's not even here this morning that I know of.

[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:16.400]
And by the way, they shoved your chair all the way down the hallway, Josh, just because it smelled so bad.

[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.440]
Not as bad though as it smelled in the, oh my, I walked in there.

[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.880]
I said, it smells like a toilet in here.

[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.200]
Your eyes water.

[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.460]
Oh my God.

[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.560]
Who took a crap just before I went in this morning?

[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.420]
So thank God we got the exhaust fan going.

[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.420]
Nice going Greg.

[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.180]
Like I said, that Greg Reed, man, assault of the earth.

[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:33.620]
Comes to radio.

[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.400]
He's a big zero.

[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:39.220]
But other than that, when it comes to the other good stuff like tickets, exhaust fans, he's the best.

[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:40.740]
He is.

[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.600]
He knows his crap, baby.

[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.220]
That's right.

[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:48.520]
That's why we're getting the exhaust fan in the old craft room there because Greg knows his crap.

[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.720]
That's what he knows about radio too, crap.

[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.940]
That's for him, for those backspeed boys tickets.

[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.080]
Right there in the front row.

[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.500]
Here's a mobile implantation.

[00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:58.740]
Hello.

[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.260]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.240]
Welcome back, buddy.

[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:01.780]
Sir, sure.

[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:02.840]
Easy for you to say.

[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.060]
Listen, I was an Amsterdam when I was young with my parents.

[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.120]
The stuff man and the hookers back then were great.

[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.000]
You say that now they're not that great over there.

[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.140]
They're like district.

[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:12.980]
There are a lot of real skanky ones.

[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.020]
There's some three attracted ones that depends on how desperate you are, I guess.

[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.040]
Yeah, because when I was there, man, they were all pretty hot, man.

[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.700]
Well, I don't know about the hookers.

[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.820]
I mean, if people, I've said this before, I'll say it again.

[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.140]
If you need to pay for sex in Amsterdam, you're pretty desperate.

[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.060]
Yeah.

[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:26.640]
Yeah.

[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.280]
Well, I am.

[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.920]
I'll pay for it anytime.

[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:29.840]
Okay, there you go.

[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.640]
At least honesty is always a good policy.

[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:38.580]
Yeah, and another thing, oh yeah, the guy said, Land Rover, Fort Lauderdale, Tony and Robert, you're a bunch of douche bags and I'm on my way.

[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.200]
Take care, Neil.

[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:39.740]
Okay, pal.

[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.120]
I'll stop the brief.

[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.060]
Whatever that means.

[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:47.560]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a mobile one line as we continue searching for the truth.

[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:53.440]
That this guy, or just, by the way, American Airlines, the Rugrats or the Ramp Rats, whatever they call them.

[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.340]
They had a full page ad.

[00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:00.740]
They took out in the hill yesterday, which I somehow missed since I don't scour every page of ads in the hill.

[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.480]
But there was a piece on the news last night and they're pissed off and fired up over there.

[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.100]
American Airlines at MIA, the Rugrats.

[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:07.920]
I mean, Ramp Rats.

[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:08.740]
I mean, the Rugrats.

[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.220]
Whatever they are.

[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.280]
The real rats.

[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:19.640]
Because they don't want to be called this and they're taken at personal just because there was this big drug bus and because everybody hates American Airlines like poison.

[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.020]
I'm going to tell you a little American Airlines story again.

[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.500]
Yeah, because I have some, like you saw me scratch out the thing on the counter.

[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:33.700]
We were going to go to Vegas in November and change the plans because it was too close to my next vacation.

[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:37.260]
So I pushed it back to like Martin Luther Coon Day next year that weekend.

[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:47.580]
So I call up and I already made long ago because you know months ahead I make all these reservations to get my tickets on American Airlines through Dallas to Vegas because I will not fly America worst.

[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.420]
So I had the tickets and they're not refundable.

[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.360]
So what choice you got?

[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.220]
So I call up American Airlines to make this change.

[00:29:55.460 --> 00:30:02.220]
I spoke to a girl who on a scale of zero owed four million points in the IQ column and I told her I had the tickets.

[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.560]
I needed to change the dates.

[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.620]
Oh, one more and I went through the whole story about what the dates were.

[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.420]
One moment please.

[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:14.180]
She puts me on hold now comes on some guy who must be her brother and husband.

[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:15.560]
Yeah.

[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.560]
And I said, well, do I have to start all over again?

[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.020]
And he goes, yeah.

[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:26.080]
So I have to go through the whole story all over again about well, these are the dates that I got to take it forward.

[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:31.220]
This is what we would like to fly on the same flights and I'm going to say there's something.

[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:36.600]
I have I could have talked to my miniature pencher and he would have had better comprehension of what I was talking about.

[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.580]
All through the call he kept going.

[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:41.180]
Like that.

[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.940]
All through this call, I must have lasted 25 minutes for the simplest goddamn transaction.

[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.640]
A moron could have done this in five minutes.

[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.880]
Somebody would have just walked in there, just picked up the phone.

[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.380]
Somebody walked in there off the street and picked up the phone.

[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.600]
Could have done it in five minutes.

[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.240]
But this American Airlines employee.

[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.740]
I don't know what you people over there at my air upset about because guess what?

[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:08.360]
Those of us who pay through the nose to fly were the ones that are pissed off and we hate you like poison.

[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:08.740]
Okay.

[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:15.920]
There may be a few of you who are good folks over there to American Airlines at my maybe a few, which I could count on the fingers of one hand.

[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.560]
On the middle finger of both hands.

[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:25.380]
But you know, it's wasting the money for full page ads to be defensive because you're pissed off being called ramp rats.

[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.980]
That should be the worst that people call you as pissed off as they are.

[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:33.640]
And I mentioned yesterday I saw I'm seeing anything about the survey about the dissatisfaction with the airlines.

[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.960]
American Airlines is at least consistent.

[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.260]
Their number on.

[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.700]
They're at the bottom in every category.

[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:40.760]
Leave it on time.

[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:41.600]
They're on the bottom.

[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.320]
Service whatever.

[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.340]
Fight.

[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:45.860]
Fight.

[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:46.420]
Forget it.

[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.700]
They took the arm in five legs.

[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.780]
Air every aspect that they could ask you.

[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.700]
They're on the bottom of the list.

[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.160]
They suck.

[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.800]
So you people over there at American Airlines instead of taking out stupid ads in the newspaper.

[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.300]
How about getting your crap together?

[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.920]
How about taking off on time once this year would be good.

[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.340]
The years we got a third of the year to go.

[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.940]
Just once before we changed the thing.

[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.580]
Any chance of that happening?

[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:08.920]
No.

[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:09.240]
No.

[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.640]
I mean this guy was even a moron.

[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:13.940]
He was a certifiable moron.

[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:18.100]
I was probably making like three bucks an hour to sit somewhere in Dallas or somewhere to answer a guy to him phone.

[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.500]
He hadn't got a clue I was talking about.

[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.020]
Twenty before 11 at 560 WQA.

[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.180]
Onil my queen.

[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:28.020]
Go.

[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.300]
Go.

[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.440]
Well where are we?

[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.800]
Can that swing keep me?

[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:58.080]
Said this Monica Lourisky.

[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:02.160]
I got to reach it but it's falling too far.

[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:07.820]
Probably what she was doing when she played her part.

[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:15.180]
Well she thanked her hand on the steering wheel.

[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.800]
Not the usual way we feel.

[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:23.980]
Sign on the road today straight ahead.

[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.840]
Grab stop was near she would soon be fed.

[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:32.020]
Gave it some gas and swear to the right.

[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.320]
Heading for the best good light.

[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.280]
She lost control.

[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:44.720]
The poor and blue and landed next to the drive.

[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.020]
Blue.

[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:53.940]
Well poor Monica Lourisky.

[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.640]
Wester card to see with sun breath.

[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.000]
But she's a luck hunter business dad.

[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:07.960]
Her mouth is not dead and she can still give head.

[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:09.540]
Oh right.

[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.760]
1046 at 560 WQA.

[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.420]
Why do we have a WAP in the 1700 on the dial?

[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:19.060]
Always a good thing to build a new station and a new format around a dying guy.

[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:24.360]
Here's the thing from the Boston Globe because I'm a started on FM.

[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:31.320]
Talk 96.9 WSJZ FM in Boston after they dumped him off EEM because he's dying.

[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.080]
It says I must show you this is from the Boston Globe.

[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:44.180]
I must show yesterday reinforced the perception that in recent years as he's become engaged in the worthy pursuits of child rearing and building a new Mexico ranch for children of cancer.

[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.380]
He's been losing the sharp, satirical edge that was his trademark.

[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:54.100]
His son Wyatt's late bedtime as well as a head wound the child and took it on the I man were chewed over at length yesterday.

[00:34:54.100 --> 00:35:02.920]
The New Mexico Ranch which is clearly captured by Mrs. Hart also got plenty of air time and brother Fred I must came on to discuss some new sheep the siblings had purchased.

[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:10.040]
At times the so energy level was dangerously low and the silence is in terminably long.

[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.860]
What do you expect from a dead man in a chair?

[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.520]
Okay, do you expect an exciting show from the dead man?

[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.440]
Oh my god.

[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.900]
And they're building a form at around him in Boston boy nice going there man.

[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.280]
Whoever's doing that's going to be camp by the end of the year.

[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.080]
Just like over here at the 1900 on your A.M. dial.

[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.560]
But like I said they got no shortage of calls over there the same nerds that call the station they're calling over there.

[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:37.400]
What do you think of that truck and Miller guy huh?

[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.040]
And what do you think about the all in yesterday I'm listening to Hank.

[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:48.900]
And he's going on as he said that he was going to do about that front page through it by Burry Jack I said about the chutzpah of John Henry and all the stuff about building this Phantom Stadium.

[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:55.540]
And the first call after I've been talking about Jake Lamata and the movie raging bull crap.

[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:02.520]
First call what do you think about that fight this coming up Hank you think whatever whoever it is they got a chance.

[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:10.360]
See this is all part of the same mentality it's all part of the same cultural American phenomenon of the American male.

[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:18.640]
How many million of mine don't know there are but there are millions and millions of them and everything in their mind is in the same it's all categorized.

[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.180]
Boxing being right up there at the forefront the next fight it doesn't make any difference who's in it.

[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:28.980]
But the next fight this is something every real man is going to talk about as if this is like a real sport.

[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:35.800]
By the way remember that call we got yesterday from that lady that went on and on and on and on about the Vicki and the family.

[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.180]
Yes.

[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:41.040]
Two voicemails from her long long voicemails saying what.

[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:49.080]
Sucky Sucky Sucky Sucky Sucky Sucky can I get to know who I am right somebody handed her the phone because I mentioned the movie rating.

[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:51.220]
One copy of the show so she can give it to Vicki.

[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:54.060]
No we don't do copies of the show lady okay.

[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.100]
And just get a life and no wonder I hated that movie like I said.

[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:04.780]
You know I used to like Joe Pesci before I saw that movie now I can't stand him the nearer I could live without and now never again.

[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:10.940]
Kids face risk of brain injuries and amateur sports that's on a front page of your newspaper this morning.

[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.180]
How about that all an airsoft Friedman who's stuck up that chair by the way.

[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:16.480]
What is it?

[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.740]
Not this chair the one that they pushed down the hallway.

[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.980]
They put they pushed it down because they didn't want it in their room.

[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:29.760]
Let me say it again why why are you trying to deflect the criticism of how bad you smell on the George okay.

[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:39.960]
The fact is that you said on the chair and that the people from the morning show from the worst team shoved it all the way down the hall because it smelled so bad.

[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.520]
How about these have these amazing things called bars of soap okay.

[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:49.500]
Maybe the guy behind you can show you how you tie a rope to it okay because it's not a good idea to drop it.

[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.660]
So coast coast go over and see Bob Green coast.

[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.680]
Stick up there join okay.

[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.520]
I'll show you one of those Randy tears.

[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.620]
In fact maybe he can elope with Randy.

[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.100]
Like I said there you go it's close.

[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:05.640]
Get out of here.

[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.740]
Josh Friedman a man who hasn't bathed since before Jesus was an infant.

[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.180]

[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:16.440]

[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:23.380]
A quick question please I know you just came back from Amsterdam I'm on my way over there next week.

[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:23.900]
Yeah.

[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.360]
I just want to give me some tips first time over there I'm going with the wife though.

[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.080]
That was a great time.

[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:28.660]
Yeah.

[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.340]
That's my tip.

[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:32.160]
Well I plan to have a great time.

[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.800]
You will well you're taking your wife.

[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.500]
Yeah unfortunately.

[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:35.380]
What do you know that for.

[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:35.900]
I'm sorry.

[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.220]
What the hell are you doing that for.

[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.840]
Well I you know it's vacation I got to go with somebody.

[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:46.480]
But anything you could tell me that I can stay I mean I think I'm staying at a decent place but I plan to do it in a red light.

[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.920]
Let me ask you something why do you people all seem like a bunch of lost school kids you know.

[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.920]
Like the guy who caused me before about Vegas.

[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:53.200]

[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.440]
I'm going to Vegas can I tell him a place to eat in Vegas.

[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.760]
Did they have a place like a restaurant in Vegas and you're going to Amsterdam.

[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:04.560]
Sir all you got to do is walk outside and walk around in the heart of the city and you'll have a wonderful time.

[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:04.740]
Excellent.

[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:05.660]
Believe me.

[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:06.800]
Looking forward to it.

[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:07.940]
Have a great great life.

[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:08.380]
Appreciate it.

[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:08.660]
Okay.

[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.100]
Just going with his wife.

[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:10.820]
I'm bad idea.

[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.220]
Kids faced risk of brain injuries and amateur sports.

[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.820]
How about that fight coming up huh?

[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.180]
How about that Muhammad Ali?

[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.540]
How about that cauliflower head Rocky Marciano?

[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.160]
How about that moron Jake Lamatta etc and so on and the list goes on.

[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:29.980]
But don't confuse the American macho male with that because this is as American as apple pie and Chevrolet and the handgun.

[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:35.160]
Another five year old kid dead yesterday by the way got caught in the crossfire of that argument between the.

[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.100]
The mother and her father do you see that story?

[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:38.440]
Another dead one.

[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.920]
Then there was a three year old kid the day before that got shot and killed.

[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:50.280]
Oh guns don't kill people see this is all part of the American sickness and I can't change it so I'm not going to get all agitated about it.

[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.360]
It just happens to be true then that punk will call back again.

[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:58.260]
Oh Neil screw you Neil screw he called yesterday by the way that was the one go back to Amsterdam Neil.

[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.620]
Yeah he's very upset that I actually had a good time there.

[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:01.520]
Sorry.

[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.000]
You believe me?

[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:03.480]
No.

[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.080]
No I'm not.

[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.920]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line.

[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:14.300]
I mean seriously can there be anything more boring than somebody calling on going to Florence Italy.

[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.860]
Can you tell me a good restaurant there a good trotteria?

[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:19.680]
Well what is that?

[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.220]
Well what kind of a conversation is that?

[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.600]
God is this a boring place with boring people.

[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.580]
I'm going to tell you how desperate the people are here.

[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:34.340]
I walk in yesterday to Eckerds which I hate like you know like poison but I only hate the front part where you go to the front counter.

[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:40.500]
You know like when you're buying stickers bars so your mom can find a rapper when she's rummaging through your garbage the next time she's in your house.

[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:47.020]
And I had to get some blood testing strips those acu Jack acu check whatever those things are.

[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:54.880]
And so I go in the back and the pharmacist the guy looks at me like like Jesus had just walked in he gave me the most astonished look.

[00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:10.020]
Seriously like I just couldn't believe that he was overwhelmed he reaches out and shakes my hand and it's like oh and I once was driving behind you on knob hill you were in your Corvette and your beautiful red Corvette couple of years ago.

[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:22.080]
Unbelievable and I mean I'm flattered that the guy is a fan and he's telling me about oh I know you know like Eckerds and I said well most of my problems that I could are up in the front side there with the catcher just to run front not back with the pharmacy.

[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:27.740]
Of course I usually never get that far back to go to the pharmacy but I happen to be close by there so I picked up the stuff.

[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:41.040]
But I'm thinking to myself not God how how dull how boring can life possibly be that somebody is this flabbergasted to see me I mean you know I'm I I just don't get it.

[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:48.420]
I look at a mirror in the morning I'm not flabbergasted to see me at all but I'm Jesus there it is you again here's hi alia hello.

[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.100]
Hi alia.

[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:52.820]
Daniel.

[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:53.420]
Yes sir.

[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:54.820]
First time caller.

[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.960]
I'm calling about Mark Anthony.

[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.460]
He can't sing for nothing.

[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:01.120]
Yeah.

[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:06.560]
He or just I think him up because he was hanging around with Jennifer Lopez.

[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:10.760]
I seen this guy in South Beach he looks like a weasel.

[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.780]
He's not a good singer.

[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:30.700]
He's not another one of those baggots is he?

[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:30.900]
No.

[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:32.740]
Maybe he is.

[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:33.280]
Not a cone.

[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:33.700]

[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:34.480]
Maybe maybe.

[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.240]
Okay I'll check him out.

[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.620]

Pound 560 on the mobile one line.

[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:43.580]
Mark Anthony.

[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:44.660]
He can't sing for nothing.

[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.760]
Make no mistake about it.

[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:50.640]
Okay don't get sucked into buying his music and going and seeing his confidence and stuff like that because the other shed over it out.

[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:51.380]
He can't sing for nothing.

[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.520]
In spite of what we we said.

[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:54.140]
Yeah we we.

[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.780]

[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:02.820]
56670560.

[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.680]
Pound 560 on the mobile one line.

[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:08.360]
We keep plugging along here we can't talk about Jim Druckenmiller you know.

[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.160]
We can't talk about sports 24 hours a day here.

[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:16.080]
We have to break it up a little bit for you between the swing clubs and a guy them you know that next fight coming up.

[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.060]
For all you macho guys they want to watch somebody beat the crap out of somebody else.

[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.080]
I'm just unbelievable.

[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.840]
How ingrained this is in American society it's like the gun.

[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:28.860]
I mean it's it's sick on the face of it.

[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.460]
It doesn't take a genius to figure out.

[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.140]
It's a sickness.

[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:32.340]
It's it's pathetic.

[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:38.860]
Just like with a boxing thing and somebody who wasn't even a famous boxer somebody who wasn't even all that great Jake Lamatta.

[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.860]
They make a whole movie out of it and because it was in black and white and then according to the Humper because his wife was a hot looking blonde.

[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:51.140]
Go go watch some porn movies if you want to see go watch Debbie does the Detroit again okay with Bambi Woods.

[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.480]
She was a hot looking blonde at least you'll see something.

[00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:59.160]
God you're going to go watch a movie because somebody is in it who looks good.

[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.860]
Who's got all her clothes on during a whole movie and it's a crap movie.

[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.020]
I don't think so.

[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:08.500]
Go see a movie with good looking people with no clothes on like Ron Jeremy.

[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:09.800]
There you go.

[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.360]
That'll cure you from all those sex problems.

[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.780]
You just you'll give it up for sookas.

[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.040]
Call up the bat this okay.

[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:23.180]
Tom we're all giving up sex for a young Kipper this year and Russia Shona and Chivu and we're giving up romantic too.

[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.320]
Aren't you far missing the glam.

[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:26.660]
I bet you're free to far missing her.

[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:31.240]
I bet you're she's not too happy with those goddamn bathless either whatever hell her name is.

[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.720]
Imaging coca junior.

[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.140]
From frow far missing them.

[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.720]

[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.100]
But we.

[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.080]
But.

[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:09.480]

[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:11.440]

[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.240]
Day.

[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.120]
If you want.

[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:19.000]
These outfits.

[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:22.520]
They.

[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.780]
Your.

[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.200]
We.

[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:28.700]
We.

[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:31.120]
We.

[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:31.640]

[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.380]
We.

[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:34.860]

[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:36.420]

[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:36.780]

[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:37.340]

[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:37.360]

[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:39.340]
We.

[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:39.340]

[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:40.620]
We.

[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:45.520]
We.

[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:50.120]
We.

[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:50.380]

[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:50.700]

[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:52.860]
We.

[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:54.180]
We.

[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:10.600]

[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:45.700]
I swear, we'll be safe in the next day.

[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:51.060]
I swear, we'll be safe in the next day.

[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:54.440]
And by the way, that young bitch that called me a couple of weeks ago, that was a cussing

[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.980]
me out who didn't or asked for my elbow.

[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.700]
OK, I was in the car about a half an hour ago listening to you.

[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:02.400]
First of all, Nick Carter has more talent than his right code than you will ever have.

[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:05.460]
And he's not a pineapple head, you stupid fat baguette.

[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:06.420]
Yeah, that's just one.

[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.840]
I'm going to be right there with a front-wheel-watch in the car tonight's week.

[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:09.520]
How about you, honey?

[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.460]
You're going to be in a front-wheel-watch?

[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:10.580]
No.

[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.160]
Stupid bitch.

[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.620]
I'll give Nick a big kiss for you.

[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:14.180]
OK, sweetheart?

[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:16.060]
God, are they pathetic?

[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.960]
So Sam comes in here, Sam, our promotions man.

[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.660]
Again, another guy that's kind of like, you know, waiting his way through life.

[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:26.440]
That's waiting with a D and with an IT, whichever, you know, just waiting around for something

[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:26.780]
to happen.

[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:31.220]
And he tells me about this QAM golf, this celebrity golf tournament that we got.

[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.020]
Remember, we had the big-

[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.240]
Roll episode in here about three, four weeks ago?

[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:39.720]
An unacceptable episode in which I got the 85th lecture on the air, by the way, about

[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:40.840]
how OJ didn't do it.

[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:41.580]
He didn't do it.

[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.080]
What a hell did Roy want, by the way.

[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:44.680]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:45.780]
What's his role?

[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:46.640]
OK, problem.

[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:51.220]
So at any rate, the golf tournament come to find out is going over like, remember what

[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.700]
we dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and WW2?

[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.240]
Yeah, that's what it's going over like.

[00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:58.180]
We got two foursome sign up for that golf tournament.

[00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.620]
So please help out our sales department.

[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:02.340]
Well, again, it's tried to do what I told them, don't do it.

[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.940]
Don't try to commercialize our center one fundraiser.

[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:06.140]
We've been doing this for years.

[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:06.980]
We know what we're doing.

[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:08.100]
We know what we want to do.

[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.560]
We do a great job of doing it.

[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.060]
Please don't commercialize this.

[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.400]
And please don't give me the excuse.

[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:13.820]
You want to raise a whole lot of other money.

[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:17.360]
Because all you're trying to do is sell a bunch of sponsors on it and suck a lot of money

[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:17.860]
out of people.

[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:18.780]
And it's going to be a disaster.

[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.140]
I don't want nothing to do with it.

[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.240]
And it's a bomb, OK?

[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.220]
Not the bomb, a bomb.

[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.040]
Eight's bomb.

[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.400]
Speaking of age, hockey Fest 99.

[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:27.160]
Here we go.

[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:28.540]
He gave me a whole bunch of crap here.

[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:29.740]
This will kill some good time.

[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:30.480]
Thank you, Sam.

[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.140]
At least it looks like you're doing something anyway.

[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.160]
Anybody believe it?

[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:33.480]
No.

[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:39.760]

[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.800]
See, it's a good thing we started with that guy from a hall on Tariot this morning with

[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:51.440]
that hockey call.

[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:52.760]
It's hockey time, baby.

[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.300]
I have some great Whitney talk.

[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.200]
And then here's this too.

[00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:58.540]
I'll just do them all together.

[00:48:58.620 --> 00:48:59.660]
It'll kill half an hour.

[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:04.560]

[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:14.700]
There you go, Sam.

[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:16.500]
Don't ask me for anything else, okay?

[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:17.860]
Stay the hell away.

[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:20.540]
Oh, by the way, and his fruitcake buddy was on the TRI yesterday.

[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:22.040]
Which one?

[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:23.780]
The one I can.

[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:24.600]
Jordan.

[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:25.080]
Yeah.

[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:29.400]
And then it takes me an extra two seconds because I'm building a gigantic

[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.360]
mental block against that name in my head.

[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.940]
Oh, God, is she something?

[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:34.960]
Here's Miami Beach.

[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.220]
Hello.

[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:37.700]
Hey, Nio, how you doing?

[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:38.300]
Okay, sir.

[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:42.220]
Will you tell this foster guy to shut up, please, because the center one is the best thing

[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:42.900]
you've ever done.

[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:43.340]
Really?

[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:45.640]
I respect you highly for that.

[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.720]
And I know the thing, so I'm a graduating senior at FIU.

[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:50.360]
Yes, sir.

[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:57.020]
And they can be take this African American history class, the worst mistake I've ever

[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:57.260]
made.

[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:57.740]
Why is that?

[00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:59.120]
What do you mean by taking it?

[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.820]
I'm taking two blocks, my final two block acting classes.

[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:02.220]
Yeah.

[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:06.260]
And then I have to take some electives that I didn't take, like an English way class or

[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:06.640]
whatever.

[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.440]
So, but it's fine.

[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:09.680]
I can work.

[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:15.000]
I'm open to anything, you know, but the poem is, first of all, my class is very dark

[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.560]
and collected, like 90%, 90%.

[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:17.820]
Yeah.

[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.540]
And do they smell bad most of the more?

[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:22.680]
No, no, no.

[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:23.540]
I can't.

[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:24.220]
I can't.

[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:24.780]
I can't need that thing.

[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:26.320]
That's a good start.

[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.100]
Like I said, if he can't look at at least, it smells good.

[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:33.240]
Yeah, it smells pretty good in there, but I like to voice my opinion, you know, I like

[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:33.960]
the poem with it.

[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:37.980]
And you can't say anything to these people there.

[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:44.220]
Go on edge and the paranoia is so sick of me that I can't really give it.

[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:44.740]
Hey, there you go.

[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.840]
You're picking on him right now.

[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:46.940]
See, you're doing it yourself.

[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.260]
Well, okay, hold on.

[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.220]
All right.

[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:49.800]
Maybe I can.

[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.740]
Don't get defensive about it, but you're picking on those starches right now.

[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.140]
I understand.

[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.140]
Next thing you're going to want to send him back to Nicaria.

[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:58.540]
Listen, no, okay.

[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:04.120]
I'm in class and we're discussing, well, that's probably what they think.

[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.360]
And I like that aroma that comes from you crackers.

[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:06.740]
Yeah.

[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:07.540]
It was pretty future.

[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:13.040]
But no, we're talking about, um, never stop and think about that about how white people

[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.120]
smell their starches.

[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:14.820]
But anyway, go ahead.

[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:15.460]
Beautiful.

[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:19.700]
But anyways, um, we're in class and the British smells pretty good.

[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:22.900]
We're discussing African American culture, you know.

[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:23.600]
What is that?

[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:24.080]
What?

[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.600]
What did they bring in take-out from Popeyes?

[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:31.160]
Well, no, like the primal culture, like what is African American culture?

[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:31.940]
What does that mean?

[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:32.300]

[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:32.760]
Crack?

[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.940]
I'm glad you asked because I really had no idea.

[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:36.400]
Yeah.

[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.740]
I was asking as just, I was saying, hey, I'm ignorant.

[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:40.380]
Teach me.

[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:41.740]
Get out of his own crack, babies.

[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:43.020]
That's a good part of it.

[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:44.120]
But they even know.

[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:49.680]
So then we started to, but this is, I, it's about religion and I will ridiculous some of it

[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:49.860]
is.

[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.700]
What do you mean some of it is?

[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:55.140]
Well, because, because some of it I take, I take a liking to.

[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.140]
I can't, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to sit here and lie to you, but don't, don't

[00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:58.640]
get into that.

[00:51:58.760 --> 00:51:58.960]
Please.

[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:02.200]
I'm going to, I want to talk to you about the story that happened yesterday, okay?

[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:02.560]
Okay.

[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:03.540]
Please get to it.

[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:03.820]
Please.

[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:04.400]
Okay.

[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.240]
No, I'm trying.

[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:14.060]
So anyway, we're talking about how the church, like, uh, or, you know, the faith mattress forced

[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:20.640]
Christianity upon, upon the, the blacks who had originally had some black culture.

[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:23.720]
And so what I said, thanks for having me.

[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:23.860]
Thanks for having me.

[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:24.720]
Nice phone system, Greg.

[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:30.840]
Basically, what I said was, um, you know, don't you guys realize that it's, it's the church

[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:31.860]
keeping you down then.

[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:36.200]
So what you're telling me that this slave master was forcing you into this religion to play

[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:37.140]
for some right guy.

[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:37.980]
And this is not.

[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:40.400]
Don't you understand the church is a substitute for education?

[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:41.560]
Don't you understand that?

[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:42.720]
You better get with it, man.

[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:44.400]
And then they're not, they're not teaching the right crap.

[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:49.500]
Superstition and mumbo jumbo is an excellent substitute for education.

[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:53.840]
Yeah, but see, it's, it that kind of doesn't pertain to these people because they are trying to better

[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:54.200]
themselves.

[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:54.600]
Yeah.

[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.020]
And you know, I do give them, I do give these.

[00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:57.920]
Then what's the problem?

[00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:58.740]
The problem.

[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.360]
Why do you keep saying these people?

[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:05.640]
You sound like Rod Corona, these people, these marches, these darkies, these clouds, these

[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.220]
smokies, these coolings, yeah.

[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:10.680]
These folks, these poor smokies, yeah.

[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.700]
These million yarns, yeah, mulees, backers, yeah.

[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:16.880]
Okay, I have a great day, pal.

[00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:19.260]
Yeah.

[00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:19.280]
Fine.

[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:22.240]
And he wonders why they to be all picked on, yeah.

[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:24.420]
Getting that good old time religion, okay.

[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.460]
Let him wrestle with that snake.

[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.280]
They have had a good time doing it, leave him alone.

[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:34.200]
God, 5670560, pound 567, the AT&T wireless line.

[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:39.520]
He's going to go far in life about to the itch, but maybe that the doorway in that classroom,

[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.820]
I think that's about as far as he's getting.

[00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:45.620]
Maybe he'll be lucky enough to get to a fair, well, the God by Charles Tebelin, by the way,

[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:49.800]
excellent book, in spite of what that farbison of joy at the at the Sun Sentinel road about

[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:50.500]
it, James Davis.

[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:52.880]
You're not fooling us, okay.

[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.020]
All you professional goi, I'm at the Sun Sentinel.

[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:58.040]
Rip in at Charles Tebelin book.

[00:53:58.340 --> 00:53:59.560]
Thanks, though, for running out there.

[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:02.280]
It's in all the bookstores and people ought to go out and get it, farewell the gun.

[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.440]
Give it a religious paranoia, all this, I cut this idiotic crap.

[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:10.540]
You want to believe in something, go believe in the pizza lot because you know that they're

[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:11.340]
consistently great.

[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:12.920]
They give you big, big portions.

[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.600]
Everything is cooked, they're fresh in that kitchen.

[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:19.820]
And, Neil, God's, I forgot to tell you the most important part of what happened to the

[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:20.940]
day I left to go on vacation.

[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:27.080]
12, 30 in the afternoon, okay, the ball gained him on right, left early.

[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.660]
I'm going on vacation, keep this in mind.

[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.720]
There's a car parked in the parking lot out there.

[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:36.980]
I hear a voice, is I'm going to my car to get the hell out of here as soon as possible.

[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:41.360]
And I hear, hey, Neil, want to grab some lunch?

[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:44.680]
Who do you think it was?

[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:46.940]
Peter Leonard.

[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:51.180]
Yes.

[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:53.640]
I was just thinking the most ridiculous.

[00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:54.120]
Exactly.

[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:59.240]
Well, what other person would be that much of an asshole on the day that I'm leaving that

[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:03.240]
I'm getting out of here early because we got a Marlon's game to go on vacation, to get

[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:07.240]
out of here for 10 days, to get out of this God for safe, Neil, want to grab some lunch?

[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:14.740]
And so I opened my fly and I said, hey, grab this, okay, jackass.

[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:17.920]
Peter Leonard.

[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.580]
I knew you'd enjoy that.

[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:24.000]
You have to really know this guy.

[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:30.920]
You have to know what a slimy, greasy, slippery, grotesque, pain in the ass, a cliche-ridden,

[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:31.920]
phony baloney.

[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:32.820]
So what's doing?

[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:33.540]
What's doing?

[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:37.100]
I'm sure everybody in this audience knows at least one asshole like that, okay?

[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:38.980]
Somebody that's always like glad-handing.

[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:39.600]
What's doing?

[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:40.460]
What's going on?

[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:40.820]
Nothing.

[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:41.820]
I have a what's going.

[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:43.900]
Yeah, but he does a great, Todd Dret.

[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:47.240]
Oh, he is disgusting.

[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.860]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.500]
See, that's one thing about this place.

[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:53.920]
Like I said yesterday, I didn't realize the importance of it.

[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:57.080]
If you can't look at at least smell good, this place, that's good advice.

[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:02.280]
Because we've got more slippery and slimy and bad looking and smelling people in this

[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:06.420]
place, not just the tea room that smells pretty bad all the time because some people have

[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.120]
got some real serious bowel problems.

[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:13.200]
But we got some people who really just, and Bifo is becoming one of them.

[00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:15.540]
Maybe that, maybe he's been here long enough.

[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.700]
Maybe another six months off start looking like that.

[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.980]
I'll redden the portion all like a blurry eye and bloodshot.

[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:23.500]
Here's a lady in sunrise.

[00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:23.880]
Hello?

[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:24.760]
Hello?

[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:25.460]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:26.300]
Oh, good morning.

[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:29.500]
I'd like to go back to Las Vegas for one minute.

[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:30.060]
Yeah.

[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:31.220]
To tell you what.

[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.900]
I'd like to go back there for a long weekend with you.

[00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:37.600]
No, of course we all know that there is no place like Vegas.

[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:40.700]
But we did discover a place very close.

[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:45.040]
And that is O'Revache in the loxie.

[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:46.060]
Yeah.

[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:52.600]
Well, it's not that funny because really, I think he would love it there.

[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.500]
I'm just going to call yesterday.

[00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:56.580]
He said that's the thing.

[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:10.700]
I'm going to call yesterday.

[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:11.120]

[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:11.120]

[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:11.120]

[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:11.120]

[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:11.120]

[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:11.120]

[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:11.120]

[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:11.120]

[00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:11.360]

I'm going to call yesterday.

I'm going to call yesterday.

I'm going to call yesterday.

[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:40.140]

[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:40.140]

[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:40.140]

[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:40.240]

[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:40.240]

[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:40.860]
I'm going to call yesterday.

I'm going to call yesterday.

[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.580]
Why do you seem hostile about it like that?

[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.360]
I'm not.

[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:01.000]
I'm just trying to see why you're in.

[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.700]
I'm just trying to see why you're in.

[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:03.800]
You're really going to get up.

[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:07.040]
So when I tell you this, the people at the top of the park that own the track now,

[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.700]
they own the bull revage.

[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.980]
I guess that's the one that big casino in Balexia.

[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:14.060]
They always are asking me, would you like to go there?

[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:14.900]
We can comp you.

[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:15.400]
Oh boy.

[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:16.300]
How do you like that?

[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:16.880]
Oh boy.

[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:18.960]
So when I go up there to the track tonight, I should tell them yes.

[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:22.060]
Yes, because it's like I said, it's not vague.

[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:22.540]
It's not vague.

[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:23.800]
It's by any stretch of imagination.

[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.700]
But it's something you can do.

[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.940]
And like you've said before, you don't go to Vegas for the shows.

[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:30.540]
No.

[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:35.380]
You go there for the food and you go there for the good time and the gambling and so on.

[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:39.280]
And you can do all those things, maybe not to the same capacity you can in Vegas.

[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.320]
But you can still have a good time.

[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:41.620]
OK.

[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:43.260]
So don't just say new.

[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:45.340]
OK, I'll say.

[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.100]
I'll say.

[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.340]
I'll give it a shot.

[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:47.940]
There you go.

[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:48.780]
See, that was easy.

[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:50.380]
It was very easy because I have no sales.

[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:51.260]
OK, thanks.

[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:52.940]
Plus it's free.

[01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:55.320]
1127 at 560 WQM do.

[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.140]
Can beat that gator meat.

[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:04.020]
If you grew up watching the muppets, then you'll absolutely love this latest version of the late Jim Hansen's master creation.

[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:05.400]
Yes, Puppets.

[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.700]
It is safe.

[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.060]
Bert and Ernie played Dick and Stiffy.

[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.760]
Are you sure it's dark in here, Dick?

[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:11.640]
Yeah, yeah, I know.

[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:11.860]
I know.

[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.080]
I'm sure that thing's sweet and gets a bear in here.

[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:15.200]
Oh, sure, Dick.

[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.700]
Big bird is astronaut Peter.

[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:18.720]
Oh, hey.

[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:20.220]
There's a hair in my mouth.

[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:22.180]
Elmo is astronaut Rod.

[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.720]
Puppet, you're not the play.

[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.240]
You're not the play.

[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:28.760]
And Mr. Snathalovicus is the hilarious astronaut's song.

[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:31.580]
Oh, I keep stepping on my big head.

[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:36.880]
Catch the whole crew because they guide their miserable love to the outer limits of the universe.

[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:38.860]
Well, they're rocket-powered parrots.

[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.640]
Final ones, ever make it home?

[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:43.980]
Yeah, it's a little smelly in here, but I kind of like it.

[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.700]
Don't miss the greatest out of this world adventure ever.

[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:49.520]
Hands pop with in space.

[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:53.280]
11.32 at 5.60 WQM on another deadly Wednesday.

[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:54.780]
We got 600 open lines here.

[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:58.180]
5.67.05.60.5.60 on the AT&T line.

[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:01.040]
Hank Goldberg from 2-3.30 a day, nice long show.

[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:05.840]
Because we got the Marlon pregame 3.30 and a Marlon game till 7 o'clock.

[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.700]
Marlon's and Dodgers followed by...

[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:08.540]
Yes!

[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.260]
...made dogman, it's 2.10.

[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.080]
And Kaplan Tendle 2 tonight.

[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.700]
We were going to put on Phil Henry, but...

[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:15.760]
Now, actually, I think we can make a compromise.

[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.880]
Well, Kerry Phil Henry, Tendle 1 will let Ed do the sports updates during the Phil Henry show.

[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:22.480]
Here's a mobile in Pompano. Hello.

[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:23.960]
Hi, Neil.

[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:24.520]
Yes, sir.

[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:27.660]
I'm a long time listener and I really enjoy your show.

[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:30.920]
Today is the first my wife has a day off during the week.

[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.760]
And it's the first time she's ever heard your program.

[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:35.800]
And she's enjoying it quite a bit.

[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.000]
I'm very honoured about it.

[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:38.480]
Could you do something for me?

[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:42.340]
You're not going to ask me for a request though, because it's starting to sound to me like...

[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:44.420]
It's not really your call if somebody wanted to speak to me.

[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:45.260]
It's a request.

[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.040]
Yes, it is.

[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:47.960]
For the effort.

[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:49.620]
That's routine on the effort.

[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:51.940]
Okay.

[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:55.460]
Thank you.

[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:56.480]
Sure.

[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.960]
How about if we just played...

[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.000]
Please don't say the effort.

[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:02.600]
Yeah, that's good.

[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.940]
Is that depressing or what?

[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:06.920]
Why did I come back here?

[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:07.940]
What am I doing here?

[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:09.300]
What am I doing here?

[01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:13.620]
Who are all these people and these alleged numbers and these things?

[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.940]
You know, you keep sitting...

[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:16.600]
They keep sitting these things out here in front of me.

[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:19.300]
And I look at them and you think we have this gigantic man with audience.

[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:23.260]
I walk into records to the pharmacy yesterday to get a bunch of blood testing strips from my guy,

[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:23.840]
then fingertips.

[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:29.800]
And the pharmacist walks up to me like Jesus had just come in and sandals and sackcloth and the asses.

[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:35.160]
And I sit here day after day after day every day of my life.

[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.020]
And all these people want is they want.

[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:37.800]
They want...

[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:38.440]
Would you play this?

[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:39.420]
Can you give us some tickets?

[01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:42.880]
What do you got for us?

[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:44.140]
How about this?

[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:45.040]
No charge.

[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.280]
It's a gas, baby.

[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.920]
5667-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.440]
Here's a mobile in the candle.

[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:55.720]
Hello.

[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.120]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:09:57.380 --> 01:09:57.720]
Yes, sir.

[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:02.240]
Hey, pretty one of the occasion you're talking about your touchy television that you got, your large screen.

[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:03.180]
Right.

[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:05.680]
And who did you have calibrate that TV with?

[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:07.000]
Is it somebody from the story you got it from?

[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:07.740]
No, I did it.

[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:08.580]
Oh, you did it?

[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:08.880]
Yeah.

[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:10.120]
Because I don't know if you were here.

[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:10.860]
I love that, sir.

[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:11.980]
Now, in the beginning, I hated it.

[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.660]
Now that I got it set up right, how do you got to do this reading instruction manual?

[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:15.020]
Right.

[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:19.780]
A lot of those new TVs have what's called an advanced service mode menu on it.

[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:25.660]
And I don't know if you're able to get into that and what that allows you to do is you can set the advanced convergence on it

[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:30.680]
instead of just converging the single crosshairs either in the center of the screen or maybe in each corner.

[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.460]
There's like a 56 point convergence on it.

[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:33.740]
Right.

[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:34.900]
And it takes some time.

[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:41.680]
But if you do that or if you have even better yet, there's a company called the ISF Image Science Foundation.

[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.620]
I don't know if you're aware of that.

[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:49.940]
But they are trying to set up some standards for all these TVs and the manufacturers and the high definition that's coming out.

[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:51.080]
And they'll come out.

[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:53.220]
A tech will come out to your house and do that calibration.

[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.700]
Well, they'll never give me a better picture than I got now.

[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.220]
I've paid it that.

[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.280]
That's a thing that's beautiful.

[01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:57.820]
It's magnificent.

[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:02.660]
You might be surprised because what they'll do is they'll do the color temperature and everything.

[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:06.520]
And they'll set up each input of the TV according to which source you have plugged into it.

[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:12.720]
And I've got a TV similar to that and they came out and it's a night and day difference between what you can do and what they can do.

[01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:14.400]
And it's about a $300 charge.

[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.220]
But it's well, well worth the money you spend.

[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:18.800]
It really is.

[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:23.900]
What are you hoping to have to, which is basically your cable and your DSF satellite?

[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:25.700]
And my big dish.

[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:27.000]
And your big dish.

[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.720]
You don't have a DVD player?

[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:29.300]
No.

[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.060]
Now you're not interested in that.

[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:31.720]
Not in the least.

[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:32.500]
Now because you're a DVD player.

[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:35.120]
I have to go to the Galaxy if I win enough money I'll buy a DVD player.

[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:41.560]
Your TV probably has what's called a component video input, which you hook up three cables to carry the...

[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.180]
Well, again, with all due respect.

[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.180]
I'm really happy with my TV looks.

[01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:45.900]
I'm ecstatic.

[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:47.020]
It's just miraculous.

[01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:48.000]
The picture is so clear.

[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:51.280]
You can reach in there and tickle their chin feathers.

[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:52.420]
Okay, that's great.

[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:55.680]
While I'm on the phone, can I call somebody a douchebag?

[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:56.000]
Yeah.

[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:59.340]
Okay, the guy that called you before the break is a chronic douchebag.

[01:11:59.420 --> 01:11:59.680]
Okay.

[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:00.740]
Thank you.

[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:01.480]
Whoever that was.

[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.200]
$567.0560, $560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:09.480]
If I can win enough money and Galaxy, I'm buying me a DVD player.

[01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:10.800]
Do I want a DVD player?

[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:11.040]
No.

[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:13.280]
No, but I'm going to buy one anyway just so I can say I got one.

[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:14.600]
I got one.

[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:17.080]
Here's Miami.

[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:17.400]
Hello.

[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:18.160]
Neil.

[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:18.700]
Yes, sir.

[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:19.300]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:19.680]
I'm doing great.

[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:19.680]

[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:19.680]

[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:19.680]

[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:19.680]

[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:20.480]
I heard a guy.

[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:25.980]
I think right before the break, maybe with that chronic, he was saying it was illegal to sell your organs, I guess.

[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.420]
He said the auction and off on the Internet.

[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.680]
Did they intervene and made him stop it?

[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:34.580]
Yeah, I don't know if you heard, but there's a guy in South Carolina or North Carolina.

[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:38.080]
He's got this big internet business where he sells his own urine.

[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:39.460]
It's guaranteed.

[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:40.620]
Drug free urine.

[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:40.980]
Yeah.

[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:46.540]
And it comes with like electronic heating device and the whole mine yard is something to strap it on your leg with.

[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:51.260]
Well, there's a lot of crazy people on the Internet all the time and as a result, they have to have people like him.

[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:57.420]
Well, you know, I think, I mean, obviously it's the foil drug test and the guy's making good money doing it slowly.

[01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:58.880]
So what's wrong with that?

[01:12:58.980 --> 01:12:59.220]
Why not?

[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:07.300]
Oh, I think it's great, but there's a senator up in South Carolina who's made his mission to legislate lies against selling your urine.

[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:07.780]
Yeah.

[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:08.820]
That's his big thing.

[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:09.800]
Is that strong sermon?

[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:10.660]
What's that?

[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:11.380]
Strong sermon?

[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.400]
I don't think it's him.

[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:14.640]
But with a guy never heard of.

[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:14.960]

[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:17.660]
But I mean, I'm sorry for these guys' heads right.

[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:18.200]
You know what I mean?

[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:19.940]
There's all kinds of crap going on.

[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:25.460]
This guy's mission is to make it so you know it's you know, punishable by a two-year jail to sell your piss.

[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:25.860]
You know?

[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:27.420]
No, it's you know.

[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.280]
Anyway, that's all I got.

[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.100]
Thanks for the good news.

[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:30.460]
All right.

[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:30.920]
Okay.

[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:33.140]
Woo!

[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.120]
5-6705-60, pound 5-60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.840]
It's 1138 at QAM.

[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:39.740]
Florida sucks.

[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:40.740]
Are you an A-hole?

[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:41.820]
How about a mother ever?

[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:47.920]
You can be, when you attend, the Euclipistic Profanity Seminar coming to a romantic inn at an airport near you.

[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:54.520]
That's where a Euclipistic Profanity Instructor will show you how to use cartoon exhibits in place of the words you really want to say.

[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:57.400]
For example, an outburst like this might prove embarrassing.

[01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.360]
Hey, Jen, don't step on that rake!

[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.600]
I'm going to hold it.

[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.620]
You're f**king s**t and f**king s**t.

[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:09.240]
But after just one seminar with a Euclipistic Profanity Instructor, the scene can completely change.

[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:10.960]
Hey, Jen, don't step on that rake!

[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.700]
Now, mother, father, teeth and crackers!

[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.000]
You court-soaped inside of a bugger!

[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:16.760]
Better, you bet.

[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:21.860]
You see, the system of Euclipistic Profanity is easy to learn, because it's been perfected over thousands of years,

[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:24.120]
and used by the world's most virtuous people.

[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:25.900]
Hey, Bonjour, no your holiness.

[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.960]
Please watch you staff, or we just had a devatican floor last over here.

[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.820]
Let you, my son, wuh!

[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:37.800]
He can pussy-footing-loathe a scoop of beef sucking us to think-check-a-pitch-haw-tire-it!

[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:38.500]
Motherfucker!

[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.880]
So, what are you waiting for?

[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:40.740]
You mother, ever?

[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:44.100]
Don't let embarrassing Euclipistic Profanity rip you a new hey-hole.

[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:47.400]
Sign up for a seminar in Euclipistic Profanity, and you'll say-

[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.880]
F**king s**t the sore thumb of a beeched whale!

[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:55.320]
It's 11.44 a.m. and whatever you said at 5.60 WQAM.

[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:57.180]
Two calls left on the board.

[01:14:57.300 --> 01:15:01.680]
We had six when we go into the break, and every single time we get that first sound of a commercial c'mon,

[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:06.440]
Bing-bing-bing, you see it here, and you watch them drop off, like flies out of a pile.

[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:12.420]
5.6705, and you notice we got two calls on it right now, and they're both on mobiles.

[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:16.300]
And like I said, if they pass that thing about people making mobile calls in their cars,

[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:17.580]
we're finished. We're done.

[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.340]
We're history, because our good buddy, my good best close personal friend,

[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.480]
who's very good at getting me backstreet boys tickets,

[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.680]
but doesn't give a crap about any of the garbage that we're working with here inside,

[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.860]
with this garbage phone system, and no 800 number.

[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:38.740]
Even if people over there in the Fort Myers, even the 70 people we got listening over there on a west coast on 770,

[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:41.840]
even those people can't call us unless they want to pay with their own dime,

[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.620]
and hang on through these five-minute breaks.

[01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:45.160]
Are they going to do it?

[01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:45.400]
No.

[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.180]
Obviously not.

[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.480]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:51.020]
Hey, I'm Neon.

[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:51.440]
Yes sir.

[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:55.680]
Hi, by the way, I'm using a headset, so it's no issue to talk on the mobile.

[01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:00.560]
I thought it called you about the auction thing on eBay. He wasn't all wrong.

[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:01.640]
He was eating the folded.

[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:06.420]
And the problem is, I'm very intimate with this, because my wife's not dialed with this thing.

[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:12.300]
But no, the family pays nothing in terms of cost for donating an organ,

[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:14.220]
it's actually all paid that are recipient.

[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:18.220]
A total cost went about $110,000 to get a kidney transplant.

[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:18.800]
Yeah.

[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:21.520]
If somebody wants a violin, they can go on a black market,

[01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:23.960]
and you can probably buy one for between $1,000 to $10,000,

[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:29.300]
but you have issues with compatibility of the issues and stuff like that,

[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:30.680]
so it's a very risky proposition.

[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:31.280]

[01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:33.900]
I just love it when people see the government step in,

[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:35.960]
the government does not necessarily step in on that.

[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.760]
There's nothing to prove if it's made for example,

[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:40.540]
if I want to go and buy a kidney for my wife.

[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:43.280]
So I don't know where to get off on doing that.

[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.080]
Okay. Good night.

[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:45.640]
Have a good one.

[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:46.220]
Good luck, Phil.

[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:51.220]
I'm not going to argue about it, because it's a risk of sounding insensitive.

[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.040]
I don't care.

[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.880]
Okay. I find it ponderous.

[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:58.440]
I'd rather talk about going to Baloxymus Accipi for the next two and a half hours,

[01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:01.100]
than talk about organs, at least not that kind of organ.

[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:01.440]
Okay.

[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.020]
That's not the kind of organ I had in mind.

[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.940]
I'm more lucky to the happy organ myself.

[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:08.220]
Remember Dave Baby Cortez, the happy organ?

[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:08.640]
Yeah.

[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:09.840]
I like a happy organ.

[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.660]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:15.920]
Here's a mobile and four-lotter deal.

[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:16.180]
Hello.

[01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:17.200]
Hi, Neil.

[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:17.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.280]
Well, thank you so much.

[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:23.180]
I will say that George was okay.

[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:27.400]
We was listening, and I needed getting better and Kudosdam.

[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.520]
I have a couple of things.

[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:33.520]
First of all, when Joseph Gack-Gack-Gack-Gack-Gack-Gack,

[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:35.280]
where it was on the...

[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:36.860]
For Hank?

[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:37.220]
Yeah.

[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:38.540]
It was all...

[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.940]
Oh, and by the way, I'm so glad you mentioned that.

[01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:45.340]
I go away on vacation and George fills in, and yes, I hear him on the way to the airport.

[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:47.880]
He's getting better every time, and I don't have that many complaints.

[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.040]
But then I come back and all of a sudden, here you are.

[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:51.940]
Yesterday, I got out of these 15 people.

[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:53.080]
Oh, he doesn't belong on here.

[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:54.920]
How come when Hank goes on vacation?

[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:59.500]
I want to sit in 600 weeks of vacation, and Joseph Gack-Gack-Gack-Gack fills in,

[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:01.340]
who doesn't belong on here for five seconds.

[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:04.000]
Not one of these sports holes calls up Hank.

[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.660]
It says, how could you put that piece of crap on here?

[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:07.380]
He's the more...

[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:08.900]
And he doesn't belong on here for five seconds.

[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:11.500]
How come we don't hear that from the sports holes?

[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:13.000]
Anyway, go ahead.

[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:14.540]
Well, yeah.

[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:15.460]
He's unlistenable.

[01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:18.340]
So Jerry's the Gack-Gack, he's sucks.

[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:19.820]
Jerry's the Gack-Gack, he's suck.

[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:20.520]
Yeah, go ahead.

[01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:21.020]
Hey, man.

[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.680]
So anyway, so I flipped over to Rush.

[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:26.720]
I just wanted to see what was going on on the other side of the world.

[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:35.820]
And to my amazement, the man was making a comparison between automobile death and gun related death.

[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:43.240]
And he was saying that he was drawing the logical conclusion, which I guess you can do in logic,

[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:46.780]
but of course in real life it doesn't it doesn't have any pertinent whatsoever

[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:52.660]
but he was saying that we should outlaw the wheel yeah because yeah because

[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:57.780]
cars obviously were invented to kill people right exactly because because

[01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:02.160]
because fifty thousand people a year or whatever it is dying automobile accident

[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:06.960]
and and and I and I was reading the reading is it even worth dignifying with

[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:09.980]
the response I mean your comments like that when you understand who they're

[01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:12.920]
what and who they're coming from it's not even worth a response what again

[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:17.840]
it's it's it's scary the gun hugger yeah but it's just a situation to use the

[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:21.860]
right-wing gun hugging a bull crap artist I was screaming at the radio I mean

[01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:25.260]
you don't need a gun to go to go to go to public to buy a loaf of bread I mean

[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:29.600]
I that's the American way that's right unbelievable okay I found

[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.500]
else for you I do you like that Oscar De La Jolla and that fight coming up by

[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:39.040]
the way oh yeah well I'll take the refer to okay in the before you left I

[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:44.980]
know you probably saw on the news there was this child molester Shapiro or

[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:50.920]
something like that and they arrested him for from last thing of fourteen

[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:55.780]
year old girl and then of course channel seven's making a big deal of going to

[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:58.560]
his house and showing all the pornography and everything else that the

[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:02.120]
kite's gotten his house and his mother who looks like throw mama from the train

[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:06.860]
mama she's up there she's saying he always wanted to be a nice boy and

[01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:11.280]
everything like that and I'm looking at this guy and I said to myself what

[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:16.020]
parents in there you had to see this guy I mean I mean he must have been 400

[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:20.380]
pounds he just he just looked like a parver I'm saying to myself like Josh

[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:25.920]
Freeman probably maybe I'm saying what parent in their right mind would leave

[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:31.540]
somebody with with this guy I mean a thirteen or a thirteen year old girl it

[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:36.300]
was like don't parents have any responsibility no that's that's also the

[01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:41.060]
same as I said about the gun that's the American way like I like this kid

[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:45.700]
who had the foster mother the Haitian kid that's in the coma right and then

[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:48.480]
they didn't even bother reporting and missing and then when they came to the

[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:51.980]
door and said oh by the way your your foster son is in a coma he's had a

[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:55.460]
horrible accident and oh close the door in their face and they don't bother us

[01:20:55.460 --> 01:21:00.500]
yeah we we're not interested we're not here that's right but but but then but of

[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:04.260]
course our society is making those babies man just keep punching them out when

and they want a handy cap on recording to your background right

[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:22.680]
did you hear about that yeah I heard I'm read the story and it's just another way

[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:26.060]
of taking stupid people and trying to make them seem less stupid and it just

[01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:29.500]
perpetuating the same racist system that we got in this country

[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:33.720]
and uh moving people along it's garbage to me that I'm totally unacceptable

[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:36.080]
yeah I mean they tried it with affirmative action

[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:42.940]
and they tried it with bubonics it's a big one more McDonald's you know if they

[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:46.000]

[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.360]
equal not you know not handicapping because I'm from here I'm from there

take Joseph Gackie out baby okay okay two calls on a boy and here we're deadly man it's

[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:08.540]
unbelievable five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t line here's a

[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:13.540]
mobile in four-loader deal hello hello yes sir I wanted to know I used to

[01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:16.600]
leave her in South Florida for uh for ten years and I moved to California which

[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:21.120]
was a great escape yeah um I'm back here on vacation right now and I was just

[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:24.400]
listening to you did I seriously hear you say that they're legislating

[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:31.300]
outlawing mobile phone sure well they're outlawed they're not legislating outlawing mobile phones

[01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:34.160]
but they're outlawing driving while you're using them right

[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:39.460]
I either they're wrong they didn't Cleveland what what is the justification for that

[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:44.100]
the justification is that they that they've uh study the number of accidents that happen

[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:48.900]
and they found that uh talking on a mobile phone while you're driving a car is just as

[01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:52.080]
dangerous as a DUI

[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.780]
geezer exactly and I have no problems with that as much as I'm against government intervention

[01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:02.000]
into our lives I happen to agree with that I see the way these assholes drive I'm talking about

[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:07.180]
people down here who on the best day in perfect weather with no cell phone in their hand couldn't

[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:12.200]
drive to save their lives and then you add the component of that talking on the phone and it's

[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:15.800]
like driving is an effort thought they're leaving all over the road they're paying no attention

[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:21.500]
their murderers out there they're crazy people what what I'm wondering is why can't they

[01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:25.900]
legislate some kind of law that simply states that the the individuals who get into the accident

[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:30.660]
should just take responsibility for being a adult I mean the mobile phone is that mean so in other

[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:34.320]
words if they kid you while they're on the mobile phone then they take responsibility does that make

[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:38.220]
you feel better you're absolutely right I understand exactly you coming from on that but the fact

[01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:42.040]
is it seems like every time there's some some kind of new statistic there's a knee jerk reaction

[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:47.140]
from the local politics it says that you got to eliminate it and I'm just wondering where's it

[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:51.460]
going to end I mean if cigarettes kill people why don't they eliminate cigarettes because it's

[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:57.520]
big business so mobile phones now you don't have to be driving your car to use them in fact there

[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:01.400]
are a lot of people are replacing their home mobile phone service and just using their mobile phones

[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:05.540]
well the phone I'm talking on that is actually a specific double phone right again self-lord is the

[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:09.340]

planning a thousand anytime off from mr. Friedman is a good time you're right I wanted to ask you Nila

[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:23.920]
if you possibly saw the special on HBO last night about the branch dividends no I did not

[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:29.700]
well I tell you you got to catch it because it was fantastic and it can't really shed some

[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:34.480]
light on really I think what happened over there with all the tapes that they have on the FBI

[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:40.220]
yeah and everything and I know those people in the branch of idiots they you know certainly not

[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:46.200]
sticking out for them they had some serious chemical imbalance and most of those people but

[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:50.360]
when you hear all the tapes and everything that was said and done boy I tell you what it really

[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:54.840]
says a lot for our government we live in a police state I've been telling people that for years

[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.460]
in a laugh at me they think I'm an extremist or I exaggerator I'm uh have a school loose we live

[01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:04.780]
in a police state and that should be proof of it to you well when I saw that special it really

[01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:10.580]
really opened up my eyes to really let me hear we had the former director of the FBI gay and

[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:15.120]
your hoover who had surveillance tapes on everybody they didn't like including Martin Luther

[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:20.020]
Cohen and all these other people and all these files he had on them so he could blackmail everybody

[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:25.140]
and this this is a criminal justice this is what we're paying our tax dollars for so they can have

[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:30.740]
all these files on everybody well then they showed everything in the uh I mean well I mean what a cover

[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:37.040]
up I mean you know I thought the JFK cover up was terrible yeah this cover up was well

[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:41.820]
American government in action baby he was really unbelievable and if you get a chance to watch it

[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:46.620]
uh okay I would watch it because I would think that you would find it extremely interesting okay

[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:52.420]
carry yourself and see you 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line it's

[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:05.740]
there was in no farmer who lives on a rock he's adding the metal just shaking his

[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:13.060]
fist at some boys who were down by the frick there being the water their hands on their marbles

[01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:20.260]

[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:27.140]
creature she sat on the grass she pulled up her dress and she showed them her rumbles and

[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:34.800]
lapses and white fluffy dunes she said she was learning a new way to bring up her children so

they would not spend while the boys in the barnyard were shoveling rep you send later from yesterday

[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:51.700]
while the girl in the meadow was rubbing her eyes at the fellow down by the dot he looked like a man

[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:58.520]
with a side of a home in the country with a big fence out front if he has her phone like

[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:05.740]
least she'd show him her nice so fast dog who was subject to fence and maybe she'd let him

[01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:13.160]
grab hold of her small tender and with a movement so quick and then she'd been over and suck

[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:20.920]
out his candy so tasty made a butter Scott and then he spread with cream all over her cooked

[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.460]
It's a 12.14 at 5.60 W.I.M.

[01:37:58.540 --> 01:37:59.360]
We had a half-buttus and then

[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.460]
We.K. got him going there for about 30 seconds

[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:02.760]
And then they're gone

[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:04.600]
Two calls on the board

[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:06.500]
5.67 it's strictly up to you

[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:07.840]
You know, because I'm not going to fight it anymore

[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:09.720]
I just I made up my mind during the last song

[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:11.780]
I just said back, put my feet up on the table

[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:13.280]
I get paid regardless, okay?

[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:14.920]
Makes no difference to me

[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:17.160]
You want to play the game, you want to do a talk show

[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:19.020]
We are fine, otherwise we'll do a music show

[01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:21.060]
See, I feel like I come back

[01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:23.140]
And I'm dealing with a bunch of little children in the sandbox

[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:25.240]
We got two breeds to call

[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:27.000]

[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.280]

Can you recommend a restaurant?

[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:33.040]
That's basically the repertoire of the South Florida audience

[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:33.700]
That's all you got

[01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:34.760]

[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:37.860]

[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:39.900]

Wow, it sounds just like me

[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:48.100]
Hey, I got a little bit of information for you

[01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:51.320]
We got the Indians in Coconut Creek

[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:54.820]
Are opening a Type 2 full-size gambling casino

[01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:57.560]
Right by that Hendrixin Toyota place

[01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:58.100]
Right there

[01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:00.000]
And that five acres in the back

[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.120]
There's going to be a big giant Indian casino

[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:04.960]
Full-fledged, full-fledged

[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:06.240]
It's the government approves it, yeah

[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:08.380]
It's already approved

[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:10.240]
And they're getting ready to break ground

[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.880]
And that little Indian store back there

[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:12.080]
Oh right

[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.440]
So I don't have to go to Baloxie

[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:15.180]
As you did, sure

[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:16.400]
Don't go to Baloxie

[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:17.980]
Thanks, thanks for the good news

[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:18.780]
All right, okay

[01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:19.980]
That's here for the Indians, baby

[01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:20.760]
Oh, right

[01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:24.960]
5.6705, see, I'm not going to go to Baloxie

[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:25.880]
I'm just, I'm not going

[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:26.920]
I mean, I know the guy

[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:27.860]
He was very sincere

[01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:29.840]
And he was, you know, he made a good point

[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.580]
But I'm not going to Baloxie

[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:35.120]
I've been to Mississippi

[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.300]
I have driven through there fast, by the way

[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:38.120]
I've driven through Alabama

[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:38.880]
Fast

[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:41.400]
I don't want to go to Mississippi

[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:43.260]
If that's, if I have to go to Mississippi

[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:44.220]
To have a good time

[01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:46.200]

You give me a subject, I'll talk to you about

[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:24.040]
Okay, that's not the way the show works

[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:26.500]
You don't call them, then I give you a subject to answer your opinion about

[01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:27.960]
That's not the way it talks your words

[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:29.260]
Call it here, call us up

[01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:31.320]
And I'll give you a subject, and then you can expound on it

[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:33.600]
Okay, there you go, that was one of the all-time best

Let's hear it

[01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:36.920]
Give him one of the subjects, he'll talk about it

[01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:38.240]

[01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:43.000]

[01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:12.120]

everything else and they were full of crap is it a great picture it's spectacular

[01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:48.820]
it's the best true color picture right tv i've ever had that kind of was giving me

[01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:51.680]
a song at an end about my spending three hundred dollars to go and have

[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:55.640]
somebody come in and there's nothing wrong with it it's not broken don't fix it

[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:59.280]
it as good as it as it can be believe me that's the set thing but i'm excited

[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:04.120]
that's it yeah i i i just think it's the greatest true color picture of a

[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:06.660]
tv ever had okay all right so i'm clearly

[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:11.380]
later back yeah me too sure yeah look at that good show no do we have a call on

[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:13.240]
the board no no no

[01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:19.560]
it's really sad man really sad and you know it just doesn't

[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:21.920]
shy with this that we allegedly have all these people listening

[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:26.080]
and not one of them's got anything to say none of them about anything

[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:32.660]
oh you're taking up the ass uh huh huh huh huh huh see it's tired it's old it's

[01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:37.480]
repetitive it's not funny it's sad it's sad and guess what the most important

[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:41.540]
part is you're listening you say you're listening so in assuming that i did

[01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:44.720]
take it up the uh whatever one or not as the case may be

[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:48.040]
what has that got through with the price of peanuts but it's a cover for the fact

[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:52.740]
that you've got nothing to say is what it is that you're a vacuum head that you

[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:54.960]
have nothing to say about anything

[01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:01.000]
23 years of my life i've exhausted myself over a fricking micro full

[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.940]
trying to get people to say something about anything just a little bit

[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:07.700]
interesting it doesn't have to be civilating it doesn't have to be great

[01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:13.460]
immaterial just anything and in this town man it's like trying to squeeze blood out of a rock

[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:19.840]
before when the sports shows come on there's a limitless supply don't even have to give

[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:23.240]
the numbers out whether they put a monkey on Joseph Gackey it doesn't make any

[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:26.520]
difference what body they should be on it's here Josh Friedman sitting on it's

[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:30.200]
sticking up that chair as long as they got a body in there those phones are we're gonna

hey what do you think about that uh dry what about jay jay what about the daddy boy

[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:39.300]

you know when you try to come in the back door rectum so to speak here's a mobile and tamara

[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:55.680]
hello yeah nil yes sir i hear your frustration today buddy yeah and maybe some of it is because

[01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:59.820]
you slam the phone down to people when you don't want to hear what they want to say uh-huh

[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:05.820]
yeah do that just start today no it's a good for a long time yeah for a long long time

[01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:11.120]
you're still listening aren't you now and then now and then you're you amused me you're a novelty

[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:14.800]
uh-huh not because you're brilliant or i listen to your ideals i'm not here to be you

[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:19.220]
unliked uh-huh you know i get the sports show at least they listen to people and they take a

[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:22.540]
consideration where they like it and i'll weigh it up that is that why they screen the call so

[01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:26.300]
heavily before you can get on the air never screen my calls now they screen all the calls on the

[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:30.060]
sports i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know they don't ask you what you do want to

[01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:34.760]
talk about on the sports shows you call screening how you want to talk about this yeah i mean

[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:39.280]
but i didn't ever call again you've never stopped me from talking about what i want to talk to me about

[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:42.960]
what talk about censorship the way you censor this way

[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:47.080]
another way because if you have the phone down entertainment show sir i slammed the phone down

[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:51.740]
on you because i don't i don't take any crap from anybody okay i'm not interested in your critique

[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:55.560]
if you want to talk about something all the side of it's interesting or not and i've been doing

[01:51:55.560 --> 01:52:00.280]
that for a hundred years here okay and you continue to listen in spite of all your protestations

[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:05.760]
you listen every day and we all know it and i have nothing to do with censorship there's no

[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:10.200]
such thing as the first amendment of talk radio the the purpose of the program is to be entertaining

[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:15.120]
and if you think that it's entertaining here all the sports nerds calling with those idiotic calls

[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:19.120]
one after another then we got different taste that's all i can tell you because i don't find it

[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:23.740]
entertaining and evidently not nearly as many people in the audience find it as entertaining

[01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:27.160]
because the numbers on this show are double what the numbers are on those shows

[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:33.580]
but that must just be because we got a few guys light and the loafers out there who put it

[01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:39.400]
down under diaries and you know those guys they do keep a diaries here's a mobile in homestead hello

[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:45.480]
thank you yes sir hey that's wonderful to follow winter like that yeah this guy's got nothing to say

[01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:50.360]
so he's gonna take a shot at me because i hang down the phone he's got nothing to say i ask him what

[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:54.840]
does he got to say he wants to talk about censorship hey wait a long time for you to hang up on him

[01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:59.280]
so listen why you were gone something happened got me so in sense i could wait for you to get back

[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:05.720]
and watch it a new story on one of the largest h-mose in the u.s and it's out west somewhere like

[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:12.380]
Nevada it's based their new policy when you want to call 911 is you have to call their technicians

[01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:17.660]
first they're four-hour train technicians who will give you approval to call 911 and get an ambulance

[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:22.540]
to you and they say that's the new spreading thing that all the h-mose you're gonna just say no

[01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:27.480]

during guidance if i'm having a heart attack right yeah at that and and before you left you

[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:37.020]
talking about the teachers that got in the bind up in the club right this guy writes an editorial

[01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:40.620]
to the hero and this is where the mentality that wants to fire these teachers comes from

[01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:46.060]
writes an editorial i cut it out that he is so upset when he sees commercials on tv where

[01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:52.460]
mothers caress the butts of newborn babies because it's invasive and sexual in nature no question

[01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:56.940]

collars are giving me a headache today god but kneel i got a guy i got to touch on something

[02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:24.820]
if you call it ago i don't think your listeners know how to do a talk show it's got to be a two-way

[02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:31.020]
oh yeah that's right i mean short a short a colla larry king in because he knows how to do a

[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:36.940]
talk show yeah uh listen kneel doesn't want to talk about the marlins nobody out here wants to know

[02:05:36.940 --> 02:05:41.520]
but you don't understand that just like the guy with a loren spilts this is this guy's idea of a

[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:46.120]
crank call because he knows i don't want to talk about it so every call it who starts out the same

[02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:50.720]
way oh it's a big day loren spilts because he thinks that it's going to irritate me i don't give a

[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:55.400]
crap i mean i get paid one way or the other it's just bad radio that's all you know i this show

[02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:59.640]
could be as good as we're doing here and we're doing great on a phantom radio station this show

[02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:03.820]
could be a hundred times better if we had real callers out there which is why we need the 800

[02:06:03.820 --> 02:06:08.340]
numbers so badly but this is too much of a cheap ass outfit to uh do you have us anything to work

[02:06:08.340 --> 02:06:12.920]
with they don't know how to do a talk show now i could bring up the channel seven story last night

[02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:17.240]
about about another isolated incident with with the child molesting crease and for waterdale

[02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:22.200]
right name i don't remember but it was you know i don't like channel seven but i was laying in bed

[02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:27.800]
flipping the remote and the whole town of the story was that he did it i mean it wasn't an editorial

[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:32.980]
but three three guys who are now in the thirties came came forward the one guy said he was molesting

[02:06:32.980 --> 02:06:37.480]
one hundred times by this priest right and they reported the story now nothing can be done

[02:06:37.480 --> 02:06:42.080]
because the statute of limitation is run out now you know you always let that kind of you always

[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:47.320]
let that kind of call go on because it's you know you like that callers have to know what you

[02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:51.020]
want to talk about too and what you don't want to talk about it's not that's just a question what

[02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:55.640]
i want to talk about it's a question of what's interesting like they kind of called earlier where

[02:06:55.640 --> 02:07:00.900]
when that you got called yesterday for example the thing about parking downtown that was one of

[02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:05.820]
the most boring calls i ever heard in my life boring call i've had a terminal for two days from

[02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:10.240]
your show and because the callers don't have material because they have no lives don't you

[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:15.460]
understand the last time that we had a real rush on this show was back during the election back

[02:07:15.460 --> 02:07:19.680]
at the end of july then everybody got away then all of a sudden i was everybody's hero then it

[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:23.500]

[02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:32.680]
they voted no against it and uh... penny share and i was a big hero but i was short of that they

[02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:40.240]

he preferred the prep would shut them out so the senior got them this is he did more than what

[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:45.300]
you think but he watched it sounds a silly he preferred cocaine to have that's the question

[02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:52.240]
that he does and he makes it point much clearer like a razor on a mirror but he wants us to believe

[02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:58.380]
that he didn't do anything Georgie bushes and his nose is clean and never but just

[02:11:58.380 --> 02:12:04.980]
being a country's running for the why how so he just ran to me Georgie's cream Georgie's cream

[02:12:15.860 --> 02:12:21.240]
no and I wasn't listening when you asked uh whatever about him etc well what I asked

[02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:25.460]
in the beginning of the show there was a thing Latin beat about the new wave of Hispanic music

[02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:29.580]
and across over artiste that's it on ABC last night from 10 to 11 but evidently nobody else in this

[02:12:29.580 --> 02:12:34.940]
audience saw it and anyway it goes on Mark Anthony is a Puerto Rican salsa singer and his album

[02:12:34.940 --> 02:12:39.380]
this it's everyone so on and Luis Miguel's got new album being released September 14 called

[02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:44.920]
marty su and uh um plus here and here comes the best part of the fact I don't know who this is

[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:49.980]
from but it says by the way although Mark Anthony's music has great rhythm he can't sing a lick and

[02:12:49.980 --> 02:12:54.620]
no one compares to Luis how do you like that Mark Anthony he can't think for sure that's what it says

[02:21:23.740 --> 02:21:28.640]
and then walked down the street and saw a new restaurant outside the restaurant a sign read

[02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:34.440]
where silence is golden but kind words come with dessert curious he decided to have lunch there

[02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:38.660]
he was shown to a beautiful table with a white table cloth and fresh cup flowers and was

[02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:44.240]
greeted by a very lovely waitress she simply deemed a smile and ready to pen and pad I'll have the

[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:48.820]
stew he said she took his order and nodded politely and returned with his meal during lunch he

[02:21:48.820 --> 02:21:52.620]
thought about the restaurant's unique slogan when he had finished the waitress just you'd

[02:21:52.620 --> 02:21:57.060]
talk the dessert menu at that moment there we began to feel quite ill no dessert for me he said

[02:21:57.060 --> 02:22:01.960]
holding his stomach what can I still get some kind words to which the waitress politely responded

[02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:06.820]
you look like a very nice man who likes to keep happy and healthy so I wouldn't eat the stew

[02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:10.780]

AT&T line here's another facts from Carlos about the 60 minutes two show last night about all

[02:22:23.820 --> 02:22:28.220]
those kids that they sent to Australia put in the institutions and how the boys were put in there

[02:22:28.220 --> 02:22:32.000]
with a cantaloupe institute with the brothers and the mothers and they were being molested as

[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:39.140]
usual as the case because they like to alter boys and you people out there you continue subsidizing

[02:22:39.140 --> 02:22:45.420]
this corrupt bullcrap and nothing that anybody can say can convince you how evil it is congratulations to

[02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:34.300]
before I was born I mean last time I checked just like when god got pissed off and it rained for 40

[02:23:34.300 --> 02:23:38.160]

5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line here's Perine hello hello Neil yes sir how you

[02:24:09.460 --> 02:24:18.120]
doing great do you agree that sports is entertainment yeah hockey baseball football and boxing yes you

[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:22.900]
you know no boxing is not sports you say boxing is not a sport where do you get that the boxing

[02:24:22.900 --> 02:24:27.600]
is not a sport what do we worry do I get it there the sport is like a competition right what is

[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:32.060]
that boxing the only purpose of boxing is to inflict as much punishment on the other participant that's

[02:24:32.060 --> 02:24:35.680]
not a sport it's probably one of the most pure sports so it is not a sport oh my gosh you're

[02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:40.580]
you're it's a guy your aunt speed the guy footwork the guy's farm for a hand coordination yeah I mean

[02:24:40.580 --> 02:24:45.720]
yeah hey not everything it's a brutal and dangerous sport I'll give it to you but not a sport well

[02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:50.560]
well how many is entertainment right how many people so it's so it's so it's top fighting so it's

[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:54.200]
bullfighting that doesn't mean that I'm going to approve of it well you know like the Stanley Cup

[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:59.080]
let's say for example you could can you compare it actually a big heavyweight champion of course not

[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:03.360]
why even the worst hockey game is a thousand times more exciting than most of these fights where

[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:08.320]
they stand around and 90 90 percent of any fight is standing around in a clinch okay there are

[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:15.360]
how many people how many people watching I'm going to hit it as well people watch golf how many

[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:20.380]
people are people watching golf to find golf exciting no I don't find it exciting but it's a sport so how

[02:25:20.380 --> 02:25:23.720]
come so many people are watching it if that's the a Brahman how many people are you going to compare

[02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:29.260]
it up to a big heavyweight championship or people watch golf and watch boxing and it's one big heavyweight

[02:25:29.260 --> 02:25:35.600]
one event let me again more people watch golf than watch golf and you got it on every day

[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:38.940]
no more people watch the masters golf tournament they watch a heavyweight boxing game every

[02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:43.280]
bunch but how often is it on the only when you compare your you I'm not we just going around

[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:47.140]
on the circle okay if you're gonna if the barometer is going to be that's like the old argument I'll

[02:25:47.140 --> 02:25:50.980]

[02:25:58.620 --> 02:26:03.920]
like Howard Coastill who became famous because of his covering of boxing and because of his association

[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:08.960]
with Muhammad Ali even he and his latter days turned against it and said that it was barbaric and

[02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:12.860]
should have been outlawed and a lot of the top sports writers have said the same thing the few

[02:26:12.860 --> 02:26:16.840]
that I got the courage to be honest about it and don't just pander to you morons out there

[02:34:39.060 --> 02:34:45.180]
I apologize if you've already addressed this issue go ahead still busy this week did you read the

[02:34:45.180 --> 02:34:50.820]
article in Sunday Sun Sentinel where you you were mentioned in the outlook section it was

[02:34:50.820 --> 02:34:55.760]
regarding public financing of now somebody made reference to yesterday that buddy Nevin's

[02:34:55.760 --> 02:35:00.120]
whose real asshole wrote something caustic about I'm a caveman because I'm not in favor of

[02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:05.560]
public financing for baseball stadium or something like that right my brother and yourself were

[02:35:05.560 --> 02:35:10.960]
referred to as cave people citizens against virtually everything and it's interesting

[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:17.540]
because the only thing that they published that my brother had said was a vague statement that

[02:35:17.540 --> 02:35:23.020]
he thinks the tax dollars that be used for school but he actually who's your brother my brother

[02:35:23.020 --> 02:35:29.060]
was mentioned in the article with you you should I guess a citizen that was interviewed and they

[02:35:29.060 --> 02:35:34.300]
basically referred to the two of you as somebody with the marlins a lot of it's referred to the two

[02:35:34.300 --> 02:35:39.540]
of you as cave people but my brother had gone it so we were somebody from the marlins who said that

[02:35:39.540 --> 02:35:45.120]
yeah I don't have that I take that as a high compliment then okay no seriously because the

[02:35:45.120 --> 02:35:48.860]
marlin people are are killing this radio station they're like an albatross around our neck

[02:35:48.860 --> 02:35:53.060]
I must be crazy I must be not yeah that's John Henry for you man he is crazy and he is not

[02:35:53.060 --> 02:35:57.260]
to if he thinks that we're gonna spend taxpayer dollars to build a billionaire stadium so we can play

[02:35:57.260 --> 02:36:00.820]
it with his play toy yeah let me say it again did you see how many people were at that ballpark

[02:36:00.820 --> 02:36:07.940]
last night yes I did a smattering probably about 2000 I would say less I say that would really

[02:36:07.940 --> 02:36:13.340]
if you count the concessionaire the concessions people and the players and you know the people in

[02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:20.700]
the parking lot maybe 2000 pretty sad yeah and we're gonna build a stadium I think not

[02:36:20.700 --> 02:36:25.360]
and then even I just wanted to see if you would I'm glad you've verified that for me I'm glad

[02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:30.040]
that I know that I find out where it came from thank you sir my pleasure and have a great thing okay

[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:35.340]
there's the good news the marlin people say that Neil Rogers is a cave man thank you so much I

[02:36:35.340 --> 02:36:39.540]
must be crazy I must be not amen you won't get any argument with me on either count John Henry

[02:36:40.580 --> 02:36:47.560]
John Henry was a pile driving man baby and a hell of a racehorse but this guy he's got no balls well

[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:55.060]
John Henry was a gilding 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 you want to build your own stadium go ahead and build

[02:36:55.060 --> 02:37:00.060]
it okay put together the financing like a real man just like Joe Robby did put together your own

[02:37:00.060 --> 02:37:05.020]
financing and stop coming on your hands and these and giving us these big very jackass stories on

[02:37:05.020 --> 02:37:08.700]
a front page of the newspaper oh well I'd like to have it over here but I'd really like to have it

[02:37:08.700 --> 02:37:12.980]
over there but if I had my brothers and whoever comes up with the best public public finance

[02:37:12.980 --> 02:37:18.460]
it that's where we'd like to have it that's just Neil Rogers that's a stick it in your

[02:37:18.460 --> 02:37:22.580]
rectum everybody else that I hear talking about including the Humper who will be on in 25 minutes

[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:29.420]
they're saying exactly the same thing just say no the public financing to build stadiums and

[02:37:29.420 --> 02:37:36.780]
arenas for billionaires and cut the crap and why in the Hank post the very good question yesterday

[02:37:36.780 --> 02:37:42.540]
I don't have the answer why are these two newspapers so much in bed with Wayne and with John Henry

[02:37:42.540 --> 02:37:46.620]
what's what's that all about I must be crazy I must be nuts what is what is the reason here what

[02:37:46.620 --> 02:37:50.800]
is the hidden thing that's got the Harold and the son scum Sentinel hyperventilating trying to

[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:56.740]
pedal us a bit of goods how badly we got to have a new stadium yeah who's getting smeared for that

[02:38:09.140 --> 02:38:14.160]
hockey is a sport I mean think about it the sport the purpose of which is to stick the biscuit in

[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:19.800]
the basket to score goals they got bigger gaps in Jennifer Lopez I mean come on what do you think

[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:24.320]

[02:39:02.160 --> 02:39:07.960]
here on this radio station I'm telling you exactly the way it is this station is losing its ass

[02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:15.000]
on marlins baseball okay they had to take the sales department and take them for a whole day remember

[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:19.720]
I'm up there two ago take them for a whole day and hold them up in some goddamn hotel room

[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:24.360]
and put them on selling marlins baseball so we could try to make some of the revenue back that

[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:28.840]
were paying John Henry which is why they're in court now and still have a resolve that

[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:33.400]
loads lawsuits back and forth about getting raped last year for the full broadcast right for what

[02:39:33.400 --> 02:39:40.320]
turned out to be a little league baseball team it's an albatross that's why George still has an

[02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:45.540]
evisbonus that's why they don't pay their bills on time he's not the fact that they're cheap

[02:39:45.540 --> 02:39:51.240]
and they do business that way and always have anyway but nevertheless because they're squeezing

[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:55.060]
the light blood out of this organization that's why we got a phone system here that even over

Uno Dosecris Quattro Sincol Sincol Sase? Yeah he needs some cool tunes not just

[02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:29.340]
Well, I'll tell you one thing about two hours ago.

[02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:31.520]
If you would have told me that we would have gotten to this point,

[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:33.540]
that we would have arrived at this point,

[02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:36.020]
I would have just laughed my ass off.

[02:42:36.320 --> 02:42:40.500]
Not that it's been great, but somehow we managed to scrape away to this point.

[02:42:40.780 --> 02:42:42.740]
And I think that after another couple of days go by,

[02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:47.140]
after we separate the time from when George was talking about swing clubs every day for a week,

[02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:49.940]
I don't think you'd be doing that again.

[02:42:50.260 --> 02:42:51.980]
Well, look who we got here. Happy holidays.

[02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:53.800]

[02:43:29.020 --> 02:43:30.220]
What a great.

[02:43:30.220 --> 02:43:31.460]
That's public's price.

[02:43:31.700 --> 02:43:33.180]
Well, can't we get to some hummentation?

[02:43:33.180 --> 02:43:34.220]
I know it's not the right time.

[02:43:34.280 --> 02:43:35.520]
No, that's for poor.

[02:43:35.660 --> 02:43:37.200]
Well, why can't we get it for Russia?

[02:43:37.420 --> 02:43:38.800]
Now for Russia.

[02:43:39.300 --> 02:43:42.420]
No, you have honey cake and you have.

[02:43:42.540 --> 02:43:43.260]
It's a cake honey.

[02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:44.080]

[02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:49.940]
Yeah, I ordered the honey cake with the raisins and fruit and nuts.

[02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:51.020]
That's to you.

[02:43:51.260 --> 02:43:51.620]
Mm hmm.

[02:43:51.700 --> 02:43:52.060]
Listen.

[02:43:52.060 --> 02:43:56.120]
And the cold nidra don't take any bulls**t on them.

[02:43:56.280 --> 02:43:56.720]
Yeah.

[02:43:57.380 --> 02:43:57.820]
Yeah.

[02:43:58.440 --> 02:43:59.440]
Probably a lika.

[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:03.360]
You're my niece made a party Saturday.

[02:44:03.580 --> 02:44:04.660]
She born a party.

[02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:05.500]
She made a party.

[02:44:05.500 --> 02:44:06.760]
How old is she?

[02:44:06.980 --> 02:44:07.460]
$41,000.

[02:44:08.940 --> 02:44:09.140]
Woo.

[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:11.680]
And she played the tape for the people.

[02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:13.420]
Well, they roar.

[02:44:13.740 --> 02:44:15.320]
They don't take any bulls**t on them.

[02:44:15.320 --> 02:44:15.580]
Yeah.

[02:44:15.700 --> 02:44:16.120]
Right.

[02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:18.020]
I think that's what really puts you on a map.

[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:19.020]
I mean, they always like.

[02:44:19.040 --> 02:44:19.840]
Epic problems.

[02:44:20.020 --> 02:44:20.580]
That was good.

[02:44:20.580 --> 02:44:22.320]
And they liked, of course.

[02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:23.400]
Thanks for calling.

[02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:25.000]
But I'll tell you, when you came up with.

[02:44:25.100 --> 02:44:26.580]
They don't take any bulls**t on them.

[02:44:26.580 --> 02:44:27.960]
That's what really made you a star.

[02:44:28.580 --> 02:44:28.900]
Mm hmm.

[02:44:29.060 --> 02:44:29.980]
That's what puts you on top.

[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:30.760]
Okay.

[02:44:31.080 --> 02:44:33.680]
And have a very happy whatever.

[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:34.440]
Thank you.

[02:44:34.580 --> 02:44:34.840]
Russia.

[02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:36.200]
A happy New Year.

[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:36.460]
Right.

[02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:37.260]
And.

[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:39.660]
Are you going to be fasting on your kipper?

[02:44:39.920 --> 02:44:41.520]
Only till 12 o'clock.

[02:44:41.680 --> 02:44:42.580]
The doctor says.

[02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:43.020]
Right.

[02:44:43.700 --> 02:44:44.100]
And.

[02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:45.560]
Well, so I'd get up around 11.

[02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:48.180]
I bought a big jar of like a filter fish.

[02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:49.740]
All right.

[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:51.280]
And stuff like a.

[02:44:51.460 --> 02:44:52.160]
We're still in.

[02:44:52.500 --> 02:44:54.320]
How about you have horse radish with them?

[02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:55.960]
No, I'm too spicy.

[02:44:56.120 --> 02:44:57.360]
That'll just tear your kishkis up.

[02:44:57.480 --> 02:44:57.780]
Yeah.

[02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:01.460]
And the next Wednesday, the 15th.

[02:45:01.460 --> 02:45:01.660]
Yeah.

[02:45:01.900 --> 02:45:03.060]
That's my birthday.

[02:45:03.420 --> 02:45:03.660]
Really?

[02:45:04.100 --> 02:45:04.360]
Yeah.

[02:45:05.020 --> 02:45:05.860]
Another year.

[02:45:06.340 --> 02:45:07.260]
I won't forget it.

[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:09.020]
And just in case I do.

[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:11.040]
Happy birthday.

[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:11.860]
Thank you, doll.

[02:45:11.860 --> 02:45:12.780]
Happy 39th.

[02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:13.000]
Yes.

[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:13.900]
Take care of yourself.

[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:15.940]
Happy New Year to you, your mother.

[02:45:16.460 --> 02:45:16.800]
And to all.

[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:17.520]
Thank you, mother too.

[02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:18.420]
And Zagazan.

[02:45:18.740 --> 02:45:19.420]
See you, too.

[02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:20.340]
Bye bye, darling.

[02:45:20.740 --> 02:45:21.620]
Okay, 147.

[02:45:21.620 --> 02:45:22.720]
Everything is okay now.

[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:23.360]
Thank you.

[02:45:23.580 --> 02:45:24.600]
From the thanks for calling, lady.

[02:45:24.860 --> 02:45:25.700]
So everything is okay.

[02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:26.480]
Everything is kosher.

[02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:28.680]
Yeah, that's what the problem is.

[02:45:28.780 --> 02:45:29.880]
All the yidlach are out there.

[02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:31.600]
They're getting ready for the big holidays now.

[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:32.420]
They're out there shopping.

[02:45:32.620 --> 02:45:34.400]
They're buying their holly and their honey cake

[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:35.940]
and all this other dreck.

[02:45:36.540 --> 02:45:39.060]
And you're filter fish, which you know, it's okay.

[02:45:39.180 --> 02:45:39.620]
I can take it.

[02:45:39.660 --> 02:45:40.100]
I can leave it.

[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:40.800]
It's like halava.

[02:45:41.260 --> 02:45:41.580]
Delicious.

[02:45:41.860 --> 02:45:42.200]
No taste.

[02:45:44.380 --> 02:45:45.260]
Here's a plantation.

[02:45:45.260 --> 02:45:45.660]
Hello.

[02:45:46.520 --> 02:45:46.840]
Hello.

[02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:47.500]
Yes, sir.

[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:48.620]
How's it going, Neil?

[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:48.920]
Great.

[02:45:49.420 --> 02:45:51.340]
What's up with all these people calling about boxing,

[02:45:51.560 --> 02:45:52.240]
comparing it to hockey?

[02:45:52.500 --> 02:45:53.460]
I don't know what's going on there.

[02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:54.540]
That's people with no taste.

[02:45:54.700 --> 02:45:55.640]
People don't understand a great word.

[02:45:55.640 --> 02:45:56.640]
I think it's not a sport.

[02:45:56.880 --> 02:45:57.280]
Of course not.

[02:45:57.460 --> 02:45:57.920]
It's a problem.

[02:45:58.100 --> 02:45:58.460]
It's too good.

[02:45:58.720 --> 02:45:59.520]
It's barbaric.

[02:45:59.600 --> 02:45:59.880]
That's right.

[02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:01.340]
Try to knock each other's brains out.

[02:46:01.420 --> 02:46:03.280]
You guys getting a ring and fight and be trapped

[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:03.860]
out of each other.

[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:04.760]
They'll cause it all.

[02:46:04.900 --> 02:46:06.320]
Well, they do it for a lot of money

[02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:08.340]
and so they can entertain a bunch of sadistic bastards.

[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:09.360]
Exactly.

[02:46:09.860 --> 02:46:10.000]
Right.

[02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:10.720]
Exactly.

[02:46:11.640 --> 02:46:12.260]
Oh, God.

[02:46:12.420 --> 02:46:13.580]
So what do you think about that day-low holly?

[02:46:14.600 --> 02:46:15.360]
I don't know.

[02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:16.380]
I think I'm going to watch that.

[02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:19.120]
But I don't know.

[02:46:19.320 --> 02:46:20.620]
I thought we're doing on pay-per-view.

[02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:21.940]
I'm going to call up head cappons.

[02:46:21.940 --> 02:46:23.520]
See how the odds are gone.

[02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:25.100]
Okay, pal.

[02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:25.700]
Have a great day.

[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:26.160]
I eat it.

[02:46:26.320 --> 02:46:26.480]
Whatever.

[02:46:27.180 --> 02:46:28.700]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 50.

[02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:30.380]
We got one last segment to go.

[02:46:30.520 --> 02:46:31.580]
Can we make it here today?

[02:46:31.700 --> 02:46:31.800]
No.

[02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:34.780]
I wanted the most unbelievably difficult traumatic day.

[02:46:35.100 --> 02:46:36.620]
Although I only had to play in reeky.

[02:46:36.680 --> 02:46:38.160]
I think that brought him back a little bit, you know?

[02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:40.200]
Don't be knocking in reeky, man.

[02:46:40.280 --> 02:46:40.700]
I'm talking to you.

[02:46:40.700 --> 02:46:41.700]
You are so wrong.

[02:46:42.140 --> 02:46:43.560]
You are the year of batting out.

[02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:43.560]

[02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:48.740]
The average last year and a half is even the babbling brook has got a bigger batting average.

[02:46:48.980 --> 02:46:50.040]
Okay, and that's the end of the lot.

[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:56.820]
When it comes to your pet elections on music and who's going to be big and who's hot and who's not?

[02:46:57.300 --> 02:46:57.560]
Wow.

[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:14.960]
What's your new face now?

[02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:16.540]
I'm going to run in a high.

[02:47:16.820 --> 02:47:18.700]
And we're in my name.

[02:47:19.060 --> 02:47:19.800]
All right.

[02:47:22.700 --> 02:47:23.540]
I'm going to run in a high.

[02:47:23.540 --> 02:47:23.540]

[02:47:23.540 --> 02:47:23.540]

[02:47:23.540 --> 02:47:25.420]
But let me take it down.

[02:47:25.700 --> 02:47:27.260]
There are thousands of things.

[02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:28.400]
All right.

[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:30.680]
Okay, what are the odds in that happening, you know?

[02:47:32.080 --> 02:47:36.240]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:37.340]
And we can do it, boys and girls.

[02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:38.740]
Just put your heads together, baby.

[02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:40.560]
So what if it is raining cats and dogs?

[02:47:40.820 --> 02:47:43.900]
What if you are going to get electrocuted just because you're on the phone when it's raining, huh?

[02:47:43.900 --> 02:47:45.500]
Is it worth the sacrifice to me?

[02:47:45.740 --> 02:47:47.180]
You bet you're sweet as it is.

[02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:50.140]
Like the guy said before, ax not.

[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:50.840]
Isn't that what he said?

[02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:51.380]
Ax not?

[02:47:53.540 --> 02:47:55.860]
10 before 2 at 5, 60, WQM.
