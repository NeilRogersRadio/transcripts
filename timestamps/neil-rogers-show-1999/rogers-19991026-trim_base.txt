[00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:07.960]
Sport Radio 560 WQAM IME4 Lutterdale presents the Neil Roger Show.

[00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.980]
To talk to Neil called 560 560 toll free for dated rarer,

[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.280]
from Count 560 on your cell phone.

[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.020]
The opinion of Neil is yes, scholars, or anyone else on the show

[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.100]
do not necessarily reflect those of WQAM easily read acquisitions

[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.900]
or the Beeson Broadcast Group.

[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.020]
Now, Neil Rogers on Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.600]
The media has to fix the need to help out.

[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.480]
I just want Peter Alliston to know that all of us American scholars on the water company.

[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.880]
We are Chinese too!

[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.920]
There you have us!

[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:56.800]
Let me take you down to the stadium where strawberry peel.

[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.120]
While making dry peel.

[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.920]
Yes!

[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.360]
And nothing seems to chime out.

[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.340]
Strawberry rehab forever.

[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.800]
Living is easy for sports, grass.

[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.300]
Who puts the sannies in the seat?

[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.980]
A silver stock can get messed up, but he can still cash out.

[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.740]
If he can hit $2.93.

[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.740]
And he won't come down because he loves his tooth with strawberry peel.

[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.220]
He's making dry peel.

[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.720]
And long as he can hit about.

[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.600]
All men.

[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.420]
Strawberry flesh forever.

[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.820]
Now when he's swinging his right street.

[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.520]
How many must be high on blow?

[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.720]
Yes!

[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.020]
And all the little things will swing but it's all right.

[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.960]
To get real high and grab a fat.

[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.860]
Uh-huh.

[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.740]
Let me take you down to the stadium where strawberry peel.

[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.680]
While making dry peel.

[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.400]
And nothing seems to chime out.

[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.220]
Strawberry rehab forever.

[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.740]
Strawberry rehab forever.

[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.020]
Peel strawberry real high forever.

[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.660]
Peel strawberry real high forever.

[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.160]
Hello, dear strawberry.

[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.580]
This is good, man. I've told you it's a comedy begin.

[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.780]
You look at the other door with the flat back.

[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.500]
And I'll try you later.

[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.060]
All right.

[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.260]
104560 WQA.

[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.700]
So what will paint to which final word?

[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.560]
I just want Peter Allister to know that all of us American gov is on the water company.

[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.960]
We are Chinese too.

[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.560]
What a sense of humor.

[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.540]
I always say.

[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.660]
Well, there's so much to talk about.

[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.360]
Yesterday I noticed that of course the cats always got their tongue this crowd.

[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.900]
But now that the whole rest of the country is in an upper about the Jim Gray thing.

[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.320]
As they should have been yesterday, well, they were.

[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.240]
The rest of the country was.

[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.740]
And I noticed now this town jumping on a bandwagon.

[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.200]
I mean, Jim Gray needs to be he needs to be put in a rubber room somewhere.

[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.860]
The country needs to be protected from Jim Gray and all of the media.

[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.380]
He's just an example of how dangerous the media are.

[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.100]
For example.

[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.340]
I go home yesterday afternoon.

[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.780]
I flip on CNN and he got this Bill Curry junior guy whose young kind of put you guy.

[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.360]
He's a friend of the family of painstored.

[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.360]
And it comes out to read course all the media are out there waiting breathlessly.

[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.020]
This is up in Orlando at painstored home.

[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.640]
And the media waiting breathlessly there with a microphone for the statement.

[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.040]
It comes out and he reads the prepared statement about the family and says this.

[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.240]
And this one says that and the please pray for the family.

[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.840]
And that's the best thing you can do.

[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.320]
And it's a hard time for all of us and we're trying out best to get through it.

[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.620]
So here come the stupid questions.

[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.380]
Well, how does this affect you personally, Bill?

[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.160]
How do you feel for?

[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.660]
And he's trying to get the hell out of there.

[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.660]
And I'm screaming at my TV set.

[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.160]
There's nobody there except me in the dogs.

[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.880]
But I'm screaming at the TV.

[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.960]
Turn around and walk away.

[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.520]
Please.

[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.820]
Please.

[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.000]
And this is my advice for anybody in the world.

[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.780]
The next time the media start asking you a bunch of stupid and intrusive questions.

[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.820]
After you said all you're going to say or maybe you have nothing to say.

[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.980]
Turn around and walk away and tell them to get the F out of your face.

[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.520]
And he says that I have no more comment to make.

[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.320]
That's what the family has to say.

[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.420]
And those are my comments and the best thing you can do is pray for the family.

[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.320]
And he turns around and starts, well, talk to us, Jim, about, talk to us about the,

[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.400]
talk to me about.

[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.620]
And you just want to take up.

[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.260]
And blow those assholes away.

[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.640]
You know what?

[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.360]
That's what I felt.

[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.980]
Blow those media back to the way.

[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.580]
Punch a media.

[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.580]
Punch a grave robbers.

[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.180]
Punch a grave robbers.

[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.280]
That's exactly what you are.

[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.640]
You people in the media like I've said for years.

[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.680]
Like Jesse says.

[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.940]
You're dangerous.

[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.380]
You're crazy people.

[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.740]
And that asshole I called right before the end of the worst team there about well,

[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.020]
you know, he did bet on the big.

[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.840]
You know, there's a thing called the Dow report that the late baseball commissioner barred your

[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.920]
Mottie head with all these out.

[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.360]
Why don't we just see what's in there?

[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.200]
Why don't we just see what's in there?

[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.980]
First of all, the allegations allegedly are that he bet on baseball.

[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.420]
What was it?

[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.840]
57 times 52 times.

[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.520]
But again, bet on the Cincinnati Reds when he was playing for the Reds.

[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.000]
But are there any allegations that he bet against the team that he was playing for?

[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.220]
No.

[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.500]
No.

[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.500]
So even though it was certainly inappropriate to be betting on baseball, there's no

[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.460]
allegation that he fixed any games is there?

[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.680]
No.

[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.820]
That he threw any game that he tried to make his team lose any games.

[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.020]
No.

[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.060]
So what's the big deal?

[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.800]
Oh, he gambled.

[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.440]
Here you got you, Darryl Strawberry, who opens him out by the way.

[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.020]
He says we were pretty much all disgusted with Jim Gray.

[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.820]
Says Yankees outfielder Darryl.

[00:06:59.500 --> 00:06:59.900]
Strawberry.

[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.360]
It was the night of celebration for Pete Rose.

[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.900]
Every player who ever plays cares about Pete Rose.

[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.780]
It was an embarrassment.

[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.660]
It didn't set to well in his clubhouse.

[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.860]
And MSNBC, which of course is just an appendage of NBC, the Guilty Party.

[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.380]
So last night in this montage of news, whatever the hell they had,

[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.760]
that Brian Williams crap that goes on for hours to kill time.

[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.040]
So they're going to give us the big load on on this thing.

[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.120]
And about America's up in arms and Jim Gray did this and Pete Rose said that.

[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.880]
And so what did they do is they show about 10 seconds at the interview.

[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.420]
They just slice it down.

[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.700]
They don't show you the fact that Jim Gray asked the same question 72 different times,

[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.880]
140 different ways.

[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.420]
Did they show you that?

[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:43.720]
No.

[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.020]
No.

[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.500]
And then they just moved on to the next, you know, whatever the next segment was.

[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.740]
Because they two got in and perished to admit that it was the peacock network.

[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.660]
That's blushing.

[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:02.980]
Every color on the peacock is the same color of blushing red from this grotesque performance.

[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.860]
How long you penalize the guy because he's got a gambler?

[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.240]
He's still got a gambling problem.

[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.520]
Everybody knows that.

[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.560]
He gambles his guts out.

[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.800]
Like I said the other day, he seemed at Pompato Park every once in a great while,

[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.940]
sitting there with a big stack of hundreds on the table, trying to impress everybody

[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.080]
with what a compulsive game.

[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.280]
He's got a gambling problem.

[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:27.180]
And again, when you put it in a proper perspective of athletes in America over the last 15-20 years,

[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.920]
is a gambling problem a big deal?

[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.060]
No.

[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.780]
Especially when there's no accusation that he ever bet against his own team?

[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.020]
No.

[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:32.320]
No.

[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.540]
And I don't even like the guy.

[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.820]
He gives me the creeps.

[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.860]
I try to give him a winner at Pompato Park that night he's up in a clubhouse

[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.520]
and he looks at me like he goes and bets.

[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.300]
I don't know how much on some other guy damn horse.

[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.120]
I give him a $27 horse and would buy.

[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:49.380]
Did he?

[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:49.520]
No.

[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.320]
But that's okay Pete, you're an expert.

[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.800]
It just keeps tearing up the tickets.

[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.600]
That's his deal, it's his money.

[00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.320]
If he wants to set a bonfire in his backyard and burn his money, that's his business.

[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.460]
Did he ever steal a freight train?

[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:03.780]
No.

[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:04.900]
Do you rob in 7-11?

[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.200]
No.

[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.140]
Rob in your money?

[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:06.360]
No.

[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:06.660]
No.

[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.540]
And let me also say this, which I know won't sit very well in the sports nerd station.

[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.500]
What's the big cynicism about painstores?

[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.620]
Like Hank said yesterday after really idiotic call.

[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.860]
I know there were so many yesterday all over the station.

[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.760]
After a particularly idiotic call.

[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.380]
Oh Hank, you're an expert on sports.

[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.200]
Share with us your thoughts on painstored on this terrible tragedy.

[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.940]
And Hank said, and very accurately so.

[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:35.920]
It's sad.

[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.300]
When anybody dies it's sad.

[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.140]
I didn't know the guy.

[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:38.660]
It's sad.

[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.020]
What is the being a sports expert got to do with that?

[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.960]
He was a golfer.

[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.500]
It's sad when somebody dies.

[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.320]
He was a golfer.

[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.640]
He's dead.

[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.300]
John Shapy, the former governor of Rhode Island, and senator for 23 years.

[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.140]
He died yesterday.

[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.520]
Of course he was an old guy, 77.

[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.740]
Anybody care about that?

[00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:57.980]
No.

[00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:58.260]
No.

[00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.320]
That's on page three.

[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.000]
Painstores on page one.

[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.660]
And there it is again on CNN.

[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:04.320]
There it is right there.

[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.200]
There's a play in the Lerge.

[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.600]
And now to California in San Juan.

[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.320]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.800]
Ten minutes after 10 at 5.

[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.780]
60 WQM.

[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:17.640]
No portion of this broadcast may be reproduced without the express written permission of WQM

[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.640]
deeply-reheat acquisition court.

[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:19.820]
Got it.

[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.040]
Right here.

[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.680]
Come to me, my child.

[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.100]
Do you need a ride?

[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.920]
Certainly I don't mind.

[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.040]
I'll drive your home.

[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.600]
With me.

[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.580]
You can trust me.

[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.500]
I'm a priest.

[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.340]
It's the least that I could do.

[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.520]
I just want it to be nice to you.

[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.300]
Some social for my child.

[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:53.180]
Say, you're quite the handsome young man.

[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.900]
I told you, take your hand.

[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.600]
And fear my magic dreams.

[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.400]
And I'll be nice to you.

[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:08.560]
It's a little wobble.

[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:20.440]
I measure men with hands until the end of the day.

[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.400]
Day and tree.

[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:24.820]
I will fix you.

[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:29.780]
On more days.

[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:36.180]
On the afternoon, five minutes later,

[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:41.200]
And so there was a chance for me to see this.

[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.920]
But I think it's the police.

[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.240]
I think it's the police.

[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.140]
I think it's your chance and remember that, please.

[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.740]
If they show us what I did with you.

[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.640]
So if I was always being nice to you,

[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.540]
please be with you, my child.

[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.120]
God be with you, my child.

[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.480]
You got...

[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.400]
Pessacene at 560 WQAM.

[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.080]
Anyway, of course, the hero, but they're obligatory, the pro and the con.

[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.520]
They're one of the most stupid pages I've ever seen in my life.

[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.020]
Dan LaBasterd, Roe shouldn't apologize for his play.

[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.780]
And then he goes on to talk about the column below, which is Greg Kotech, saying,

[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.520]
Roe's appearance was self-serving and Roe's feet rose and ass.

[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:35.780]
And the contrived, contrived, pro and con, crossfire, bunch of crap.

[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.160]
As opposed to saying, well, here's our columnist and let him write their own opinion,

[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.240]
whatever it is, even though they don't have much credibility anyway.

[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.720]
This is just another classic example of what's wrong with the people in the media.

[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.340]
You're sick.

[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.400]
I know we have a lot of people in the media listen to this show.

[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.540]
You're sick. You're a bunch of grave robbers. You're lunatics.

[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:53.540]
You're out of control.

[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.640]
You have no credibility.

[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.060]
You're nauseating. You're disgusting.

[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.060]
The whole thing is just how much controversy can we stir up?

[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.740]
How much publicity can we get out of this?

[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.760]
As opposed to having any basic common decency, which forget about that?

[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.220]
Because does the media have any basic...

[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.660]
Oh! No, none. Zero. Zipity Doodah.

[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.960]
Which of course goes back to the whole thing with Ken Star and that he'll, uh,

[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.760]
bubblegate thing, the penis gate.

[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.120]
Like it was somebody's business that he was getting a couple of blow jobs

[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.920]
and doing phone sex with Monica, with that anybody's business besides Bubba and Hillary?

[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.700]
No. Of course not.

[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.980]
So we had to spend 18 months, $47 million by the way they spent.

[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.980]
Let's round it off to a nice 50 million.

[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.380]
So let me say it again.

[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.940]
John Chafee, Rhode Island Senator, date at the age of 77, heart failure.

[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.640]
He was a governor three times of Rhode Island.

[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.760]
He was in the Senate for 23 years.

[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.120]
He died. Now he was an old guy, you know, 77.

[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.080]
That's maybe old enough, maybe not.

[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.200]
But he's dead.

[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.080]
That's his with his death.

[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.820]
Floridian's lost to front of the Everglades.

[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.640]
One of the few moderate Republicans left.

[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.080]
Not one of those foaming right-wing maniacs.

[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.500]
That's on page three, eh?

[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.860]
But on page one, eh?

[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.700]
Ghostly air tragedy.

[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.200]
Now see, this was a major story, but primarily for one reason.

[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:21.200]
And that was that here was this pilotless plane floating along up there in the sky.

[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.600]
Even though of course it was only a small plane, a little jet.

[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.560]
And that wasn't like your, you know, 747 or an Airbus or, you know, any big commercial jet.

[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.660]
But nevertheless, it could have landed anywhere.

[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.320]
It could have crashed into a populated area.

[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.500]
And it would have hurt.

[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.680]
And it would have hurt somebody.

[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:35.180]
That's right.

[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:35.800]
It would have hurt bad.

[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.360]
It wouldn't have hurt them because they were already dead on the plane.

[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.640]
That's why the Pentagon was involved.

[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.120]
And that's why they were up there waiting to see if they were going to get orders from the president.

[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.040]
They had to shoot it down depending on where the thing was going to crash.

[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.140]
Which isn't it amazing?

[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.040]
Maybe God must have been looking.

[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.260]
He wasn't looking after the people in the plane, but he was looking after the people on the ground.

[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.480]
Well, you know, he can't do everything.

[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:01.600]
But out there in a wilderness, not even an Aberdeen South Dakota, but like out west of the city, you know, out in the middle of the Yenim's belt.

[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.980]
God said, let it land in Yenim's belt.

[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.080]
And poof, it landed in Yenim's belt.

[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:06.320]
Yeah.

[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.780]
Cracked right into the ground.

[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.860]
In a nice soft mushy ground too.

[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.640]
So it just went right down in there.

[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.560]
So it didn't go splattering all over the place.

[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.160]
And possibly hurt anybody, even the cows.

[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.120]
Nice going, God.

[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.160]
Thank you.

[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.280]
But so that was the big part of the story.

[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.860]
Was it a big part of the story that was paying the steward?

[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:28.540]
I mean, no.

[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:35.700]
I hate to break the news, and I don't want to sound insensitive because like I said before, it's a tragedy when anybody dies, especially somebody as young as he was.

[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.400]
But unless you're a golfing person, I mean, I know who he was.

[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.960]
Only because you get inflicted with the names of golfers all the time, because this crap is on TV incessantly.

[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.700]
George had no idea who he was.

[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.660]
My brain filter works perfectly.

[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.440]
How do you like that?

[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.260]
I bet you there are a lot of people in this audience who never heard a pain steward until yesterday.

[00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.060]
Of course, there are a lot of people in this audience also never heard of John Chafee.

[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:01.140]
Who?

[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:01.880]
Yeah, right.

[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:02.700]
What was his handicap?

[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:04.920]
Age.

[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.060]
Old age.

[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:09.580]
77, I think.

[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.100]
I mean, like I said, I want to sound insensitive, but what's the big deal here?

[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.640]
This reminds me of Princess Diana and mother sister Teresa.

[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.020]
Whatever her name was, mother sister, she was a mother.

[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.260]
You know, they die on the same weekend.

[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:34.340]
Mother Teresa, who's a wrinkled up old bag, she gets like 15 seconds there on CNN, on headline news maybe, with Lynn Russell.

[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.580]
Princess Diana, oh my god, it's going on and on and on.

[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.440]
What on for months?

[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:41.660]
It's still going on.

[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.000]
There's still a lot going on trying to talk about Diana.

[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.220]
Anybody talking about mother Teresa anymore?

[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:46.520]
No.

[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:46.900]

[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:56.020]
Who allegedly, you know, was doing all these good things, you know, like preventing people from having abortions and forcing people to reproduce like cockroaches, things like that.

[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.780]
But at least she thought she was doing good stuff.

[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.760]
But she was a wrinkled up old bag, kind of like Senator Chafee from Rhode Island.

[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.460]
He was a wrinkled up old guy, 77.

[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.300]
Probably didn't play too much golf anymore.

[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.800]
So here's a guy to play golf.

[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.860]
He gets killed in a plane crash and like just like with JFK Jr.

[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:22.280]
The other four and maybe the other five, they're not really sure about this Bruce Borland, who's, was a golf court designer for Jack Nicholas.

[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.260]
I'm not really sure if they figured out yet if he was on a plane or not.

[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.680]
But so the other people that were on a plane, they're also dead.

[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.520]
Am I correct about that?

[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.460]
Including the pilots?

[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.560]
Anybody talking about that?

[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.700]
No, because they didn't play golf.

[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.680]
They weren't golf champions and they didn't wear knickers.

[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.400]
That's probably the most important part is they didn't wear knickers.

[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:49.300]
Now seriously, if I were to tell you that a guy who wore knickers got killed on a plane crash yesterday and didn't tell you the name, what would be your first impression?

[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:50.900]
Nick or lover?

[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.440]
Right, exactly.

[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.620]
In addition to which, here's a guy whose final words were...

[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:05.740]
No, I just want Peter Alliston to know that all of those American golfers on the water company, we are Chinese too.

[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:06.240]
There you go.

[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.620]
He had a sense of humor.

[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.740]
By the way, how about some sperm donors out there?

[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.500]
We're getting guys wanting to donate some sperm?

[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:15.660]
Come on, here we go.

[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.800]
Squared, squared it on the internet.

[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.480]
Auction of ovarian eggs on internet ignites firestorms.

[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.100]
And of course these are beautiful.

[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.060]
I'm looking at the one.

[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:28.760]
She's beautiful.

[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.860]
Oh, I'm looking at Jesus Christ.

[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:31.920]
Did you see these pictures?

[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.160]
Uh, no.

[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.320]
Two out of the three that they have pictured on here.

[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.800]
Oh my god, they look like good dime store hookers.

[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.240]
I'm sure it's just a bad photo.

[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.000]
No, it's not.

[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.560]
The one in the middle, she's pretty hot, but the other two.

[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.300]
Good, God.

[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.860]
The one on the right looks like Rosanne on a bad day.

[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.820]
And she wants to sell her eggs.

[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.360]
Chicken little could sell those eggs better in this pitch.

[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.500]
Anyway, on the internet, they're auctioning off ovarian eggs.

[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:00.200]
The idea being, and from 15 to 150 grand, by the way, for the privilege.

[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:08.380]
And they say if people want to spend 150 grand for the eggs of a gorgeous woman with an IQ of minus 10, then there you go.

[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.000]
That's what the fertility experts are saying.

[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:10.600]
That's up to you.

[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:12.660]
Now let me ask you.

[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.260]
Are they, are any, are any,

[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.740]
in people donating their eggs, you know, people with a brain, people who might contribute something.

[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.740]
Now, it's only important that your kids look beautiful.

[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.060]
They can be dumber than saw dust, but it's important that they look great.

[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:23.980]
What do you say of that?

[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:24.540]
Oh, right.

[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.000]
Yeah, we like good looking people.

[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.220]
We don't care about smart people.

[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.140]
We don't admire smart people.

[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.400]
We don't encourage smart people.

[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.060]
We like beautiful people.

[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:32.780]
And I'll echo that.

[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:33.820]
I like beautiful people.

[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.120]
Young and dumb and full of fun.

[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.300]
Yeah, that's what I always say.

[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.220]
Here's the mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:43.460]
Hello.

[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.040]
Bill.

[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:45.620]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.560]
How you doing, buddy?

[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:47.020]
Okay.

[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.100]
Bill, I want to talk to you about that feroz thing, man.

[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:50.560]
Yeah.

[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.700]
I think that journalism is a jerk, man.

[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:54.720]
You think what?

[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.720]
I think that journalism said, interview them as an asshole.

[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.200]
Some journalists, I thought it was Jim Gray who interviewed him.

[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:00.800]
You said journalists.

[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.940]
Well, I got the reporter from CBS, or wherever.

[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.340]
From NBC, the asshole.

[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:05.600]
Yeah.

[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.800]
He's not a journalist, he's an asshole.

[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:11.160]
I think it's okay to smoke crack, but it's not good if you get a better couple bucks.

[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:11.620]
I'm in pain.

[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:11.980]
Right.

[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.820]
You know, you can go to all the famous.

[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:15.900]
You smoke some crack.

[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:16.440]
Yeah.

[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.100]
But don't let the kids start training their baseball cards because they might get expelled from school.

[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.880]
And don't forget about beating up your pregnant wife or girlfriend, too.

[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:23.380]
That's okay.

[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.060]
That's all right.

[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:25.860]
Okay, have a great day.

[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.500]
So there's a guy who was touching around the edges of it.

[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.860]
It was that the journalist from CBS.

[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.000]
Was that who went to the police?

[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:31.120]
No.

[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:31.500]
He's close.

[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.180]
He's warm.

[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.440]
See, this tunnel catch up.

[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.640]
They'll get the information in about a week and then they'll be talking about it.

[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.580]
When you least expect it, they'll be all foaming at the mouth.

[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.500]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.240]
America was pissed off and fired up.

[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:51.880]
The calls were pouring into NBC to the local affiliates, to the network, all over the goddamn country.

[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.140]
And what's this town got to say about it just like the usually just like the painstored death yesterday?

[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.640]
That's what they got to say about nothing.

[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.740]
Well, Hank, you're very intelligent.

[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:03.860]
What are your thoughts?

[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.300]
Let's share with us your some perspective on the death of painstored.

[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:12.520]
Here's West Palm Beach.

[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:12.760]
Hello.

[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.200]
Hello.

[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:14.760]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.980]
Yes, you know, I just wanted to get your take on you.

[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.080]
I'm not a Zoom estate, a walkie-g-in game, Danielle.

[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.220]
What can I do for you, sir?

[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.700]
What's your take on it?

[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.640]
What can I do for you, sir?

[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:27.760]
That's it.

[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.100]
I just want to get you take this.

[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:29.820]
Okay, take this.

[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.580]
Take two and call us in the morning.

[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.340]
Okay, pretty weak.

[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.240]
5, 6, 7.

[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.760]
Are we on the year today or what?

[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:36.760]
Not on the year?

[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.320]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 7.

[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.800]
By the way, where the hell is Maddie Bell?

[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.600]
He's an asshole.

[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.360]
Where the hell are the real ratings for me yesterday?

[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.440]
Where's all the stuff that I'm supposed to get here when a rating book comes out?

[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.360]
The summer book comes out.

[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.640]
We kicked ass here in mid-day.

[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:48.920]
Ow!

[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:49.920]
Morning and afternoon.

[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.540]
What a kick to ass except they got all the commercials.

[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.160]
Nobody's listening more than five minutes a week.

[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.520]
What a kick, serious ass.

[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.260]
And Maddie Bell, he goes out to lunch when the ratings come in.

[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.760]
And our program director is going around the alley.

[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:01.700]
Eeeh!

[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.560]
I want to go.

[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.100]
Damn numbers, inquiry minds.

[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.360]
Want to know about that minuscule number any afternoon with the babbling brook.

[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.660]
They want to know the grade they're number.

[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:09.960]
They want to know about the laughing.

[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:10.840]
Did they show up at all?

[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.000]
Here it is 10.30 the next morning.

[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.380]
And do I still have the stuff?

[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:14.620]
No!

[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:14.860]

[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.600]
Only here at QAM.

[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.320]
God, this place is unbelievable.

[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.800]
Jim Mandage talks sports again right here.

[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.880]
On sports radio 5, 16, Q, A, F.

[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.280]
Arachite, f***ing blow!

[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.640]
The American cheesecats will remind you that everything tastes better with cheese.

[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:37.620]
I hate broccoli, except when my mom melts cheddar cheese on top,

[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.260]
then I even ask for seconds.

[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.480]
Yes, there's nothing like cheese to make things taste terrific.

[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.720]
I'm a sideshow geek in a circus, and I eat ground glass for a living.

[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:46.520]
My secret?

[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.480]
I top the shards with grated parmesan.

[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.300]
It tastes great, and the cheese helps to absorb the blood.

[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:55.540]
That's right, nothing cops things off like a big sweaty glob of cheese.

[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.060]
My husband likes me to, you know, do him, but I hate the taste.

[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.100]
So I just wrap it in an individual slice of American cheese.

[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.340]
It goes down easy.

[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.180]
And that makes it easier to go down.

[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.380]
Cheese makes everything taste better.

[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.540]
So remember, don't forget your cheese.

[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.240]
What is it?

[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.220]
12.31 already?

[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.700]
10.31 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.280]
They're still hucking a china about the...

[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.540]
Automatically growing to emergency pressurization.

[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.000]
About the little jet on CNN, on and on, hour after hour.

[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.240]
At the risk of shouting in sensitive for the 20 million time, let me say it again.

[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.860]
I'm not moved. I'm not...

[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.980]
I have no feelings about the death of pain storage.

[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:34.080]
Do you have any feelings about the death of pain storage, by the way?

[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.800]
I think that Chinese impersonation was really funny.

[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.640]
It was pretty funny, yeah.

[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.420]
No, I'm serious. It doesn't phase me.

[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.020]
It's sad when anybody dies.

[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.540]
It was an accident or was tragic.

[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.220]
But how about the other people who died on it?

[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.300]
They were famous golfers.

[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.100]
See, this goes back again to something that I keep preaching and preaching and preaching.

[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.000]
Your life, anybody out there.

[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.520]
Your life is just as valuable as Princess Diana, JFK Jr.

[00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.780]
Painstored, anybody?

[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.400]
Oh no, we're not famous.

[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.080]
Oh, so if you're famous, your life is worth more.

[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.180]
Uh-huh. Then some people like the people who got elected.

[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.860]
You didn't have the Hurricane Irene.

[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:12.920]
Seven of them, by the way.

[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.920]
Tom Jicke says it was just some heavy rain.

[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.120]
Immediately did a great job here.

[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.140]
And as usual, Tom, you're full of crap.

[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.660]
Here in a business section,

[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.800]
Irene's tool estimated that $600 million

[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.660]
cropped damage is extensive.

[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:28.600]
$600 million.

[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.240]
Over a million people were without power for some of her law more than a day.

[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.260]
And Tom Jicke says, oh, it was just some heavy rain.

[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.440]
Immediately did a wonderful job.

[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:39.580]
What do you all know your bitching about?

[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.880]
They did a crappy job.

[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.540]
In fact, here's a letter to the editor in the Sun Centrelus morning.

[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.680]
It says it was obvious by 10 or 11 a.m. on October 15th

[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.940]
that Hurricane Irene was coming our way or released a lot closer than anticipated.

[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.420]
Because of no hurricane warning being posted,

[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.460]
many employers would not let their employees go home.

[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.140]
My fiance is employed by UPS.

[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.640]
They kept in delivering in that hurricane.

[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.580]
One of the four casters in the National Hurricane Center said that they were not going to put up the hurricane warning

[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.440]
because it would only confuse people.

[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.020]
We've had two close calls this year.

[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.520]
Floyd and Harvey, we were prepared.

[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.760]
This time we got a storm and no one was prepared.

[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.080]
Not because of the complacency on the public's part,

[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.860]
but because the National Hurricane Center did not change the watch to warning.

[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.920]
It says, Jeannie Sanders in Hollywood.

[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:21.860]
Nice going, Jeannie.

[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.600]
Jeannie, whatever your name is.

[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.200]
Nice going, honey.

[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.260]
Ken Demarzo in the Harold writes a letter to the editor this morning,

[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.260]
short and right to the point.

[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:30.840]
This is excellent.

[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.780]
Maybe one of the all-time best letters ever written.

[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.660]
It says, if our city county state and national politicians were more concerned

[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.080]
with what was going on in Miami and Miami-Dade County,

[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.080]
instead of what's going on in Havana, we'd all be better off.

[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.980]
Don't a third world city and a third world county deserve a third world airport?

[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.240]
Nice going, Ken.

[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:50.580]
Oh!

[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.620]
And the answer, by the way, is that yes.

[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.180]
Yes, they do.

[00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.300]
56705, 505, 505, 60 on the 18 and 20 wireless lines.

[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.040]
Somebody will call us today, by the way, and tell us why we're wrong.

[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.300]
Well, we should be very upset about the death of painstower.

[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:05.360]
That was a great guy.

[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:05.660]
He was.

[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:06.980]
And he never stole a freight train.

[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.800]
And what's wrong with wearing knickers anyway?

[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.420]
Here's a lady in Naples.

[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:10.740]
Hello.

[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:11.560]
Hi.

[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:12.160]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:17.000]
Well, the sad thing about the media is that the poor family has to have their TV off.

[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.820]
Otherwise, I've got to hear it every three minutes.

[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:19.240]
Yeah.

[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.840]
But I think it was an odd thing.

[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.200]
I think that families ought to stop sending these spokespeople out there

[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.380]
and feel obligated to make some kind of a statement.

[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.940]
Just tell the media to bug off.

[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.220]
Obviously, we're in mourning now.

[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:29.420]
Right.

[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:30.300]
Kind of tragic thing.

[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.320]
And if you can't figure that out, then you have to be able to film.

[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.440]
I agree.

[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.760]
And about Pete Rose.

[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.640]
I'm surprised he didn't punch that guy right in the nose.

[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:40.580]
I would have loved it.

[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.400]
And he would have had a 90-share easy film.

[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.760]
He was very good, though, because he said, well, I'm really surprised

[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.440]
when you do that.

[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.940]
You know, that you would ask me these questions.

[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:49.400]
Yeah.

[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.420]
So he was trying to get that over and over again.

[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:51.780]
I know.

[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:52.980]
I know.

[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.840]
Anyways, I wanted to ask you.

[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.920]
I know Vegas would be mobbed at New Year's.

[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:02.740]
Do you think by the seventh, there'd be a lot of rooms open and everybody going home?

[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:03.160]
Oh, yeah.

[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.760]
There's always a lot of rooms.

[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.720]
Many hotels now in Vegas.

[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:06.700]
There always are rooms.

[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.040]
And I've taken $200 from Trip and Fort Rodinilla.

[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:10.420]
Great.

[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:10.820]
Do it.

[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:11.300]
Take it.

[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.420]
You'll love it.

[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.640]
And what else do I have?

[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.420]
Did you know that the coach, the Atlanta Braze, was a wife, Peter, just after that?

[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.520]
The manager, Bobby Cucks.

[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:21.980]
Okay.

[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.540]
And then the change of subject to hockey.

[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:24.700]
Hit the pot.

[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:25.480]
Go to the oven.

[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:25.740]
Okay.

[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.100]
Thank you.

[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.120]
5667-0560, pound 560.

[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.780]
Well, what was he trying to say?

[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.560]
Oh, I thought I wanted an interpreter.

[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:33.680]
Well, she's over in Naples.

[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.640]
She's under a lot of pressure.

[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.100]
A lot of gypsies over there.

[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.500]
5667-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T.

[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.760]
I'm embarrassed for you, people.

[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:41.040]
Okay.

[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.380]
I'm going to embarrass for you.

[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.960]
I'm looking at the...

[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.200]
I come in this morning and I look at their phone.

[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.300]
I got like two lines lit up.

[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.340]
Erie V. Talks Station of any kind across America is inundated with people.

[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.760]
Even people who can't stand, people who don't like baseball.

[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.340]
Even people who don't care about the world.

[00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:57.760]
Serious.

[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:02.040]
Even people who like Bob Cossus, which I can't find any of them.

[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.860]
And their outrage.

[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:04.780]
They're just nauseated.

[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.460]
They're fed up.

[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.600]
They're disgusted with this.

[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:12.900]
With immediate insensitivity and feeding frenzy and just fixation on embarrassing and humiliating,

[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:17.080]
and degrading everything that it touches, bringing it down to the lowest common denominator.

[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.800]
And here...

[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:21.700]
Same old crap.

[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.460]
Nothing moves these people.

[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:24.020]
Nothing.

[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.300]
Like trying to move a goddamn mountain in the Elves with your toe.

[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.480]
Here's a mobile in Cooper City.

[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:29.760]
Hello?

[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:30.860]
Hello, Nell.

[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.260]
Yes?

[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.140]
Um, down 25 pounds on the act.

[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:34.860]
And thank you, sir.

[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:36.460]
Um...

[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.040]
Great.

[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:37.820]
Exactly.

[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.060]
Um, I wanted to talk to you.

[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.400]
I'm tuned in very late about half time of that boring football game last night.

[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:45.460]
You know how...

[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.500]
How about anybody watch that?

[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:47.640]
I tuned in.

[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.460]
How could anybody watch the Falcons in the Steel of the Falcons?

[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.080]
And by the way, another great game, 13 and 9, by the way.

[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:53.660]
Exactly.

[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:54.300]
Oh.

[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.120]
At half time, they start showing a United Way commercial.

[00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:58.580]
Yeah.

[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:05.820]
And who's talking in the background about family and how much he does for his community...

[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:10.960]
How much he does for his community and how much he loves his family?

[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:11.540]
Who's that?

[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.740]
Radio Cannon!

[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:18.760]
The same radio cannon that was arrested down here for picking up a $20 whore.

[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:18.980]
Yeah.

[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.800]
These are the Falcons.

[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:21.960]
For the Falcons.

[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:28.020]
Who gives a crap about radio cannon or paint Stewart or Pete Rose?

[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.760]
So why were you watching that game?

[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.620]
I just...

[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:31.100]
How could anybody...

[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.200]
How could anybody be that bored that they'd be watching do that game?

[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.300]
Living channels on the dish.

[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.420]
That's all I was doing.

[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.340]
Um...

[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:37.860]
Don't do it again.

[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.360]
Listen, one last thing.

[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.680]
I know you know this answer and it's bothering me.

[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:42.340]
What...

[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:49.300]
I think it was like 1975 in an All Star game where Pete Rose ended a guy's career, the catcher.

[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:49.940]
What was his name?

[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:51.960]
When he smashed into a life.

[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.800]
Was it Ray Fossy?

[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:54.160]
That's it.

[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.260]
You're the best.

[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.220]
Have a great day.

[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:56.740]
Thanks.

[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:57.940]
Ray Fossy.

[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.860]
It was Eugene Robinson by the way you got to...

[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.780]
Yeah, I didn't ring a bell.

[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.080]
I mean, Ray Buchanan, I know Pat Buchanan was right.

[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:04.340]
Eugene.

[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:09.500]
So here's a guy that told me how boring the game was and he doesn't watch it anyway but he happened to be channel serving.

[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:10.600]
It doesn't even have the name right.

[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.400]
I'm sitting here like, who the hell is he talking about?

[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.560]
It was Eugene, man, from the Falcons on the eve of the Super Bowl.

[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:17.540]
Oh.

[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:22.180]
Like I said, how is it possible to have a sports station in this market?

[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.580]
It would be like having an all-is-really station in the middle of Nicaragua in Africa.

[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.540]
I don't understand it.

[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.980]
I mean, it doesn't make people bad the fact that they know nothing about sports.

[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:36.080]
It just makes them less dimensional, I guess.

[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.620]
You know, that's a kind way to put it.

[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.620]
What do you say Pat Buchanan picked up a hooker in Miami?

[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:42.220]
Is that what he said?

[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:42.820]
Yeah.

[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.280]
And she turned him down.

[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.940]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.040]
Well, you're very knowledgeable.

[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.700]
George, you know a lot about life.

[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.580]
What are your thoughts?

[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.580]
What's your thoughts on this tragedy with...

[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.580]
I don't think Nicaragua is an appropriate fashion statement for this day in the age of...

[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.160]
Now, let me ask you.

[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.180]
I thought he was Irish.

[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.320]
Isn't that a Scottish thing?

[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.260]
I mean, I realized that the Scottish invented golf.

[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.740]
But was he Scottish?

[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.040]
Well, it's fine out.

[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.440]
There you go.

[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.920]
21 before 11 at 5, 60, WQS.

[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.080]
Good night.

[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:15.480]
You hear it?

[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.900]
Sports Bad Radio WQS.

[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.860]
That's so s**t.

[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.500]
Kuku, baby, let's turn this mother out.

[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:31.340]
Pop the MagiRapper is on my TV.

[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:37.240]
No one heard of him before, or his name is Pop that he,

[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.440]
I said that's Pop the MagiRapper.

[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.440]
I'll be here that long.

[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:49.320]
Not unless he learns to sing or to write a friggin song.

[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:54.860]
I said Pop the MagiRapper is all over MTV.

[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:07.720]
Only because of one shot not glorious VIG that that guy maybe swung himself in making it this way wrong.

[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.800]
18-hats short dead best friend.

[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:11.980]
Seek King.

[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.300]
Let's fall.

[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:17.200]
Snoop Doggy Doggy Doggy Dog on the ball track.

[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.000]
10-44 at 5-50 WQM.

[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:24.540]
Pop Lincoln fact is that you know my good close person with red bob Lincoln because he keeps sending me those hotel books four times a year for free.

[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.260]
So it just got a fact from America worst.

[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:28.800]
America worst.

[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.300]
Room is still available.

[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.400]
50% off New Year's 99 in Vegas.

[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.380]
I'm assuming he means New Year's 2000 or whatever it is.

[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.400]
Why 2K?

[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.520]
50% off because a lot of people naturally are terrified.

[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.960]
They don't want to go anywhere on that because they're afraid they're going to go up there and do a painstored in the sky.

[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.620]
Because aren't all of your planes hooked into computers?

[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.480]
I mean when you turn on the ignition aren't they hooked into computers?

[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:50.680]
No.

[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.120]
And I think I'm going to like fall out of the sky.

[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:52.300]
No.

[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.400]
On New Year's Eve and stuff.

[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.660]
It fits the same computer you got in your car.

[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.200]
Yeah probably that's right.

[00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.340]
Maybe the steering column lock.

[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.840]
Oh by the way I got my car first yesterday.

[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:01.320]
Thank you.

[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.840]
And thank the 50 million people that called my friend Greg Nelson over their back road.

[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.640]
Yeah he calls me home yesterday.

[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.880]
She I've had 45 million people call and say you're all upset about the vet.

[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.000]
And what can I do for you?

[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.460]
And I said don't worry about it Greg.

[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:13.640]
I had a towed up the street here.

[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.340]
They took care of it.

[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.600]
They replaced the steering column lock.

[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.360]
I got it back.

[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.420]
It drove all the way from there to my house two miles.

[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:20.980]
Do I have it today?

[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:21.360]
No.

[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.500]
I don't want to push my luck.

[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:23.940]
Okay?

[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.260]
You get a new part in there.

[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.560]
It's going to like ease itself in.

[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.420]
It's got a break in.

[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.520]
You know I don't want to like push my luck this year.

[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.220]
Maybe next year.

[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.260]
Maybe for why two K.

[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:32.900]
I'll drive that one.

[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.180]
Okay we got 600 open lines here.

[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.800]
Error me day the same thing here.

[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:40.660]
I think if they can just load us up with spots like the morning show I can play music.

[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.940]
Oh by the way speaking of music bulletin spy report power 96 yesterday.

[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.840]
The music in your soul.

[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:51.940]
Bravo all stars.

[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:54.520]
Thanks to me and they're saying oh it's another kid curry discovery.

[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:55.580]
Yeah.

[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.020]
That's okay now we're even for the back three points tickets.

[00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.620]
Okay kid pops whatever your name is.

[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:05.340]
See what I don't understand I just our program director just came in here with that usual with another schedule.

[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.860]
He's putting these schedules in it like do I care about these schedules?

[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:08.480]
No.

[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:12.920]
Does anybody care about that really when you come right now it's the same old stuff we're here every day.

[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:18.220]
But that's his big thing it's the you know make make a busy work kind of thing for our program director.

[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.740]
And I said to him what's the story on these ratings?

[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:21.800]
I mean I don't get it.

[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.420]
It's now almost 11 o'clock in the morning.

[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:26.160]
The day it's like 24 hours later and he went.

[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:27.920]
Like that.

[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.720]
See that you're right they don't speak the language at all at all.

[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.360]
They don't speak the language of broadcasting.

[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:45.740]
Like the ratings came in aren't you people concerned that you're software your hardware your in between where your underwear it didn't work.

[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:46.840]
Aren't you concerned about that?

[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:47.060]
No.

[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:52.400]
I mean don't you want to make a little bit ever have somebody get them all to you which we like to have him here on a year.

[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.360]
Especially acquiring minds we've been building up to this moment they want to know that big number on wins three to seven in the afternoon.

[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:07.560]
They want to know about very jackass his favorite waffen that had 45 front page stories in the heraldor promote them up waffen did they show up anyway.

[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:15.760]
And I can't give it to my audience out there they want this information they don't give a crap about painstored about p-ros about Jim Gray.

[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:21.560]
They don't care about any of that stuff do they know they want to know a book on like a point the zero zero's that's what they want to know.

[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.920]
Because they're about to say this like me.

[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.620]
We'd like this year to get a point minus something.

[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:39.460]
Mine first time in history of arbitrarian a minus in front of the number minus 82 for that bitch that f'ing bitch can't get the number he's a well maybe you'll have to go over to kiss and win him off.

[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:40.780]
Oh don't you know don't do that.

[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:49.060]
Don't put somebody all the trouble to do that I'm sure somebody over there like Bob the K with his bad wake I'm sure he could probably get on it and the guy named facts to.

[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.760]
Facts is over the right stuff but well we got this you know we got a little bit here.

[00:35:55.820 --> 00:36:09.000]
Why should we go beyond that why should we make an effort to that's what gets me about this place why should we actually make an event or why you such a prick that you want to force us to do something that's why in spuddy or gigantic numbers you know Greg reached into the yesterday going after the show to take a leak.

[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.940]
And I hear somebody is in one of the I thought it was you as a matter of fact because you're always taking crafts in there.

[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:18.880]
I thought I might have been George but then I thought that's not George somebody's making like a lot of those book of Brian noises you know in there.

[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:30.640]
Yeah real quiet no I know well somebody was not quite I don't know what he was doing in there besides that but anyway so I finished taking my leak and before I can get out of there the door opens from the from the.

[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:35.220]
A turlant and out springs Greg read our fearless leader how do you like that and he's going.

[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:47.460]
Oh great book now that he come in here because he assumed of course I've left by this time in fact maybe that's where he was hiding out until the coast was clear he's looking at this watch to see it's about 205 to 10 coast is clear the

[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.540]
bag is gone now I can walk around a building.

[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:55.040]
I don't have to congratulate him on a great book while the rest of us one in the tank because of our 85 minutes spot breaks.

[00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:03.840]
And he came up with one of the most incredible lines I've ever heard in my life he says to me you know people think it's easy to get ratings.

[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.780]
Is it until we brought you over here we didn't have any ratings.

[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:20.140]
And I thought to myself gee if that's the case how come I have to have a nervous breakdown and threaten to walk out for you to do anything in that studio what is that goddamn 800 line coming in.

[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.860]
Why is it that every time we ask for anything no matter how inexpensive it might be.

[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:33.640]
It requires like a major we have to have meetings the lawyers have to get on the phone back and forth.

[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:39.160]
But we didn't have any numbers over here till we brought you over here Neil those are the words from our fearless leader after he said.

[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:40.540]
That.

[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.400]
And I thought to myself well gee sure have a strange way of showing.

[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:50.480]
Just like our program director see that's one thing in the other stations.

[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:56.380]
You can say what you want about boy Gary and about Steve nickel he's an asshole well you can say that.

[00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:08.880]
But when the ratings came out if they had a stand on their head because it's part of the program not only for the audience is sake and for my sake but everybody in a business to and when the ratings conduct because this is the only place where to find out how they're doing.

[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:22.500]
Their management stock on a tell them by the way speaking of how they're doing I go and home yesterday Hank was into a commercial break after that brilliant call by the way oh you know a lot about sports your very knowledgeable Hank what are your thoughts about paying store in this terrible tragedy.

[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:33.580]
After that brilliant call Hank blow and I got off rightfully so so they go into a commercial break and I figure I got about 10 minutes now so I flip over to a smegma radio smegma fm 103.5.

[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.300]
And just as somebody predicted yesterday they're playing.

[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.220]
Oh you got it on there.

[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:44.760]
Oh I don't think I have actually I made a night you're playing with a lawyer reunited by peaches and her.

[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.800]
Oh my god.

[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.760]
Peaches and squirm.

[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:59.360]
And this station is getting a frickin number in this market their number one and men 25 to 50 40 after them and their number two behind my action the midday.

[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:08.040]
They must they must to give in diaries to every fag in the market here to get this whole music get out of here with this crap.

[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.780]
We are family baby with two bees.

[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:19.640]
Jesus Christ it was okay and it's time and once in a great while I like hearing some of that stuff again once in a while.

[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.300]
But a steady diet of that crap.

[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:23.720]
Oh my god.

[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.580]
That's not guaranteed more affected than the atkins you be puking your guts all day here and that.

[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:33.980]
And all of a sudden this meteor first time clear channel has ever done anything in this market with even a minimal impact.

[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:38.380]
Rick and suds have vanished from the landscape vanish disappeared.

[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.360]
The psychotic bitch she so low we can't even get enough pages to find her number.

[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:50.320]
In fact probably the birds are got away she's on my back pages somewhere there can't find a goddamn thing.

[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:59.740]
But finally they hit the jackpot with disco I just I'm sorry I'm not fine I'm not believe it.

[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:00.740]
Oh pain.

[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.940]
I was going to do a good thing there and you scoop me up on it.

[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:08.820]
Here's Carl spring.

[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:09.200]
Hello.

[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:10.500]
Hey Neil.

[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.060]
Yes sir.

[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:16.380]
Hey just a little word of warning to the woman going to Vegas she did say she was flying America West.

[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:17.360]
Oh did you say that?

[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.540]
You know you were kind of talking to that.

[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.200]
I don't think you said that.

[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:26.060]
No you were kind of talking over at the end when you said oh go for it baby good luck and you said like yeah America West down like oh geez the worst.

[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:30.800]
America worst they are the absolute worst they make American Airlines seem fantastic.

[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:40.940]
As far as the rape you can in guy I mean not only did he get that wrong the guy been using Robinson but she's I mean Ray Fawkes career didn't end because he was never the same player but he still kept on playing.

[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.840]
It seems like he was trying to die roads for playing tough baseball and bowling him over at the plate.

[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.960]
Hey do you have any I don't know what that was supposed to prove.

[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.200]
I don't know either.

[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:53.920]
Because he's slid I mean remember like it was yesterday they showed up a million times he slid in an octagon flying.

[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:59.220]
And what's the big deal with that that he was a hard-nosed piece of crap that was the way he played the game.

[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.660]
I've got to happen to Piazza like four times on the brave series.

[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:01.920]
Right.

[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.700]
Hey do you have the sports page in front of the front panel?

[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:05.800]
Yes.

[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:06.560]
Sports section.

[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.220]
All right you got to go to two page 2c right inside of.

[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:11.080]
Yes sir.

[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.200]
Middle up toward the bottom it says boxing.

[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.160]
Tyson's North Perth remains in limbo.

[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.800]
Right Tyson's purse it's a pink one to understand.

[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:25.020]
You go all the way down to the last paragraph and look at the name it says meanwhile a sexual battery lawsuit has been settled out of board.

[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.220]
Lady Wattusa G superior court.

[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.580]
One word Lady Wattusa.

[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.640]
Lady Wattusa J.E.

[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:36.640]
J's superior court complaint against Tyson with schedule go to trial but party settled a matter last Friday.

[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.780]
A sexual battery lawsuit against the female photographer named Lady Wattusa G.

[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:42.100]
All right.

[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:43.840]
How you be doing Lady Wattusa?

[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:48.760]
I'll never understand there are still fans Tyson fans out there that will stand by this guy.

[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:49.280]
That is correct.

[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.880]
The second coming in I the guy he lost his title in 90.

[00:41:53.480 --> 00:42:00.940]
He just he's a scumbag forget about losing the pedal or nice a scumbag that keeps putting on all these shams in these scams and people keep paying to watch this crap.

[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:08.320]
I mean I happen to have show time I've got the small vision as part of the package so I turned it on because I'm not spending any extra money to watch it.

[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.460]
It was like I just unbelievable that this stuff happens.

[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:20.000]
How come on the interview Mike Tyson as a little as he is nobody gets up in front of him and says hey Mike you're trying to be in a scumbag and doing all of these grotesque barbaric unacceptable things.

[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.500]
How come nobody ever says that to him?

[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:22.500]
Jim Gray wasn't around.

[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:23.400]
Oh yeah that's right.

[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:28.340]
So he got war I like I like to see Jim Gray do that Tyson and see Tyson just knock his head off.

[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:34.080]
Well he got warned by the official during the round about hitting on the break and the official said no more Mike you're going to lose the point.

[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:34.420]
Right.

[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.420]
And then I turn up at the end of the round.

[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:38.360]
I mean I quite the Tyson fans are like radar fans.

[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.100]
Other teams have done anything in 15 years.

[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.300]
Very sweet people.

[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.320]

How's the Eugene Robinson I mean a radio cannon to.

[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.980]

[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.660]
Yes South Miami.

[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:04.260]
Yes sir.

[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:14.200]
Yes nobody brought up the little fact just think about the national outcry from all the rich golfers if the plane had been going towards a large city and they had to shoot it down.

[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.740]
Yeah oh yeah we were talking about that before the show started this morning it had nervous breakdown.

[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:19.640]
How come they have been going there and rescue them you know.

[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:24.180]
Yeah they wouldn't know if they were dead at the time they would just said oh they're the murder dog.

[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.160]
Can you imagine everything that would have been going on.

[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.620]
Yeah I mean even though they were dead how dare they shoot them down.

[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:29.420]
Exactly.

[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:30.620]
That's all.

[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:33.220]
I mean are you upset that pain store is dead.

[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.300]
Doesn't bother me.

[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:35.320]
Okay thank you.

[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:40.580]
I mean you know I'm not doing this for the purpose of being insensitive but I just don't understand why this is such a major story.

[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:45.360]
Why it's on the front page why we've had about 24 hours of continuous coverage about this I don't get it.

[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:50.260]
He was a golf guy and a good one okay but how about if you would have been a bad one.

[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:54.860]
How about if you would have been a golf guy that wasn't quite so famous.

[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:08.260]
The media see it used to be like well you know we don't know is it the chicken in the egg is the media you know molding public opinion or they just reflected that argument is law that's long since over with okay.

[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.940]
The media drags the public around like a bunch of sheep by the nose.

[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:16.700]
Oh this is very important you better pay attention to this why because we said so.

[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:20.360]
Oh okay you're right he was real important what was the name.

[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.260]
Four minutes before 11 at 560 WQM.

[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:29.140]
Ed Caplin knows the scores starting at 10 of the last 10 ends.

[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:33.340]
We tonight only on 43550 QAF.

[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:35.040]
WQM.

[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.100]
My heavy horse tail.

[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:43.520]
Well I hate what the two in on QAF.

[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.900]
I want what they had before these are my kind of guys.

[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:53.880]
What the hell are they doing anyway.

[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.360]
It's a manly down the dime really.

[00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:00.340]
I want more risk for golf boys real high.

[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:09.440]
When I listen to the sport a manly voice won't get my attention but we're really good to sit in the shorts.

[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.160]
A squeaky high voice will give me the other action.

[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.940]
Well I hate what the two would argue with you.

[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:21.160]
I'm going to this here and straight men with voice this high.

[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.580]
Now I'll have to get deeper as that closet is in.

[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:28.260]
So I'm going to press all the macho's ran.

[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.600]
The check out Chris for a night to help the fans aside.

[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.540]
Yeah there he does have a macho sports guy.

[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:37.920]
And his voice has a crack.

[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.660]
It's a 12 years old.

[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.740]
Yeah, I'm a little like that.

[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:44.000]
Yes, Dan, I'm real close to the radio.

[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.280]
And they're going to sit on up there.

[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.900]
Really makes my balls.

[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:50.360]
Come on.

[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:51.860]
And that's Rome man.

[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:54.380]
He's smarter than my infrared brother.

[00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:59.800]
It's 11.0.2 at 5.6 and maybe they can get warrants for Marty on Waffen.

[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:00.740]
Maybe they'll get the number within.

[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.780]
So here's the big thing in the herald this morning about Barry Jackass.

[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:09.040]
Barry's beginning is 5th season I heard guilty high preventating about this this morning.

[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:09.780]
Nice going guilty.

[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:14.480]
Beginning is 5th season covering the heat including a second is primary beat writer.

[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.540]
Underland the beat part.

[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.260]
A former adjunct professor at the University of Miami.

[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:24.940]
Oh god.

[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:26.980]
Oh the pain is so great.

[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.380]
I think the last gallon of flems on the way out now.

[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:31.980]
Oh my god.

[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.320]
He also covers broadcast sports for the herald and two national publications.

[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:40.120]
He has broken dozens of stories over the past few years including John Henry's bid to buy the Marlins.

[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:44.940]
It leaves out the part about Don Smiley bar in the Marlins that was on the front page 500 days and wrote I left that out.

[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:45.420]
Yeah.

[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:50.040]
The renaming of Joe Robby Stadium, the wording of MLS and WNB18s to Miami.

[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:56.520]
Several heat stories and virtually every major local sports broadcasting story like Neil Rogers and asshole and doesn't carry all those press conferences.

[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.440]
Even though the station never had any numbers until I put him on the air.

[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.860]
What's the story with these numbers now?

[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.160]
He's going to go over to kiss and get some.

[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.500]
Why does he have to go over there?

[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:07.960]
Why can't Bob McCade do it?

[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:11.960]
He is going to do it but they're finishing their music log.

[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:14.260]
Three yet.

[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:23.240]
They're finishing their music log.

[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.280]
Bob McCade is dropping a little log over there now at Kiss.

[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:27.320]
How do they do by the way?

[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:28.360]
Do they have any number? Kiss?

[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:30.380]
No, I never even look at them.

[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.500]
Not usually the four share.

[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:36.240]
They always have the same guy at the end number because it's the same nose pickers that listen to the shot kicking music yet.

[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:37.900]
How do they do?

[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:38.460]
How do they go?

[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:40.240]
Men 25 54 in the midday?

[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.080]
How do they kiss doing?

[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:41.340]
What?

[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:42.620]
I'm just guessing 35.

[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:43.440]
It's always a 35.

[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:45.100]
Oh, here it is.

[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:46.320]
Oh, my God.

[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:46.920]
A five point.

[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:47.240]
What?

[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:47.820]
That's a men.

[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.500]
Men 25 54 in midday.

[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:50.680]
They're number seven baby.

[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.280]
Drop in from number four with the same number.

[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:52.920]
I don't get that.

[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:55.320]
I don't understand that but nevertheless.

[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.500]
They're kicking some serious, they're shot kicking some serious ass over there at Kiss.

[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:06.820]
They're working on the music log so Bob has to go over there and do it and has to open up the door to tell us I'm going to go over there and get the number.

[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.920]
I'm doing something for you guys.

[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.200]
See this?

[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:08.900]
I'm doing something.

[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.960]
Yeah, is he doing something?

[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:12.280]
No.

[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:13.780]
Besides making up those stupid schedule.

[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:14.060]
No.

[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:19.020]
So Barry Jackass who hasn't covered by the way anything that has to do with this radio station.

[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.420]
It was busy running the front page stuff and the Harold about laughing.

[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.420]
A station that nobody can hear and nobody listens to.

[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:25.960]
They left that out again.

[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:26.300]
Didn't they?

[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:26.560]
No.

[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:27.020]
Huh?

[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:27.800]
They left it out.

[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:32.040]
X publicists for Baptist given 21 months in prison.

[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:32.380]
Oh!

[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.100]
All right.

[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:41.900]
Tampa, a former publicist for the National Baptist Convention USA, was sentenced on Monday to 21 months in prison for failing to pay taxes.

[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:45.620]
On more than a half a million dollars she received while working for the group.

[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:51.840]
Bernice Edwards 42 also must pay 109 grand of the IRS and serve three years of supervised release.

[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:59.940]
Edwards saw the NASD-US district judge Henry Lee Adams for leniency because she's a single mother to four children including an infant.

[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:07.020]
Oh my God, those two words are reverberating to my aching brain.

[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:07.860]
Four?

[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:09.100]
That's a sterilization.

[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:09.940]
Huh?

[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:12.220]
What if the Baptist knew about that before they hired her?

[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.740]
Four sterilization single mother of four including an infant.

[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:21.320]
I'm very remorseful of the action that I pleaded to and take full responsibility. She said, I don't know how we can make it.

[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:26.280]
Edwards of Milwaukee faced up to 10 years in prison and a half a million dollars in fines.

[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:31.540]
The judge ordered that Edwards undergo mental health treatment and not open any new bank accounts or have any open intername.

[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:39.920]
Edwards was co-defendant in the trial of Reverend Henry Lyons 57, a former director of the Baptist Convention now in prison for embezzling four million dollars in prison.

[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.340]
He's doing business with the organization.

[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:42.980]
Don't be frustrated.

[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:43.540]
All right.

[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.900]
Those good old Baptists who are busy trying to tell everybody else that they're going to hell.

[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.720]
I mentioned those Baptists are going to hell. What do you think?

[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:52.160]
Uh-huh.

[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:56.120]
Can we have anybody by the way call and tell us why pain store was important yet now?

[00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:01.280]
I'm waiting five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.400]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:04.620]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:05.380]
Okay, sir.

[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:09.480]
Uh, that's pocket change compared to what Trinity did in a week.

[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:10.140]
Oh, I know that.

[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.280]
Well, he's got a lot of transmitters to put up.

[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:15.880]
Listen, a lot of licenses to pay people off for a lot of transmitters to put up.

[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.200]
A guy called you yesterday.

[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:18.640]
It was my father.

[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:22.640]
He works for GM specifically works on ignitions and steering columns.

[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.020]
Yeah.

[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.060]
Tell him you about disconnecting the battery.

[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:25.400]
Right.

[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.180]
I talked to him last night.

[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.020]
He wanted me to give you a message when you get your car back.

[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:30.740]
I got it back.

[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:31.560]
You got it back.

[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.540]
Uh-huh.

[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:33.880]
Did they tell you what they did to it?

[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:39.360]
He said if they didn't put them replace the ignition switch and the steering column lock that you have the same problem over.

[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.860]
They replaced the steering column lock but not the ignition switch.

[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.580]
Well, he said more likely you have the same problem over and over.

[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.100]
Are you serious?

[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:46.780]
I'm serious.

[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:47.820]
Are you sure?

[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:48.800]
I'm positive.

[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:52.320]
If you listen to you for years, you know, that's what he does for a living.

[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.640]
I'm going to have that problem again.

[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:54.560]
That's what he said.

[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.940]
If they didn't replace both items.

[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.640]
Oh, I can leave my number with George and you can talk to him personally.

[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:00.880]
But that's what I wanted to talk to him.

[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:01.340]
He didn't depress.

[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:02.880]
I thought it was all done with this crap.

[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:06.700]
And he said if your car messes up three times the same problem, you can't.

[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:07.120]
They can't.

[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:08.920]
They do have to give you your money back or a new car.

[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.180]
But I haven't taken it in.

[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:11.440]
This is the first time I took it in.

[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:12.020]
Oh, the first time.

[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.160]
To show you how stupid I am.

[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:14.360]
Uh-uh.

[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.900]
Because I kept saying it will never happen again.

[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:17.120]
I don't want to scare you.

[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:18.860]
Here's what he told me to tell you.

[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.100]
Yeah.

[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:20.020]
It hasn't happened yet.

[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.780]
But he says there's a possibility you could be going down a highway.

[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.260]
Down the highway.

[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:25.580]
Yeah.

[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.300]
And that steering column could lock up.

[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:27.720]
Really?

[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:28.180]
Yes.

[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.420]
Because you're having that problem.

[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:30.220]
He said it.

[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:31.340]
Yeah.

[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:34.380]
So he wanted you to know that because we want to-

[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:35.000]
I'm getting rid of it.

[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:38.100]
I'm not going to- next time I drive it, I'm going to drive it up there to the back where I'm

[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:38.700]
getting you a 2000.

[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:39.840]
I'm going to get rid of that thing.

[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:40.180]
Yeah.

[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.840]
Well, his birthday is next week the same as yours.

[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:43.220]
Yeah.

[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:44.260]
I want to tell him happy birthday.

[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:47.120]
And I was going to send you a magnifying glass where you could go.

[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:49.360]
I want to find more numbers.

[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.620]
Well, if I had the pages here to find it on, I'd have it for you.

[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:56.500]
But our program director is on his way over to Kiss Right Now to what Kiss It.

[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:57.200]
All right.

[00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:58.120]
Thank you.

[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:58.580]
Thanks for the band to-

[00:51:58.580 --> 00:51:59.200]
Thanks for the warning.

[00:51:59.260 --> 00:51:59.820]
I'm getting rid of it.

[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:00.080]
All right.

[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:00.500]
Thank you.

[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.140]
That convinced me.

[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:01.420]
Okay.

[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:06.580]
Just like when the tow truck driver showed up there at the gas station, Amico on Sunday night,

[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:10.220]
and I pulled up over there in my blue event, and I said to him, I said, you see it, always

[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:11.660]
pay to have a spare when you got a Corvette.

[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.700]
And he looked at me and he kind of went like-

[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:14.800]
Like that.

[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:16.440]
Pretty good guy.

[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:20.960]
5-6705-60, pound 5-60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.200]
So, yes.

[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.340]
By the way, Pizza Loft tonight, 6-8 o'clock.

[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:28.040]
Well, That will have the best of Neil and all that stuff to see the結之前.

[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:29.360]
And those keychain buttons.

[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:29.740]
Yes.

[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:34.520]
My best close personal friend Bob McKay called and said he's going to facts over what he has

[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:35.820]
already printed up right now.

[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:36.220]
Yeah.

[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:39.380]
As soon as he's done with that log which is what's tying up their computer and printer.

[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:39.840]
Yeah.

[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.460]
They'll print out a bunch more stuff whatever they have.

[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:44.100]
That's why his glove got to go over there just to them.

[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:45.460]
He does have to go over there.

[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:46.100]
Yeah, I had a little pressure.

[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:46.480]
Summer.

[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:47.400]
Well, he's got nothing else to do.

[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.660]
He's got nothing else going on.

[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:50.740]
What?

[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:54.000]
No, I know you don't wanna say anything because he's listening in the car right now.

[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.060]

[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:56.760]

[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:08.900]
useless

[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:11.580]

i'm gonna say that's a five fifty wq a

[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:17.160]

[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:17.640]
king

[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:20.380]
however

[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:22.360]
i

[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:22.700]
process

[00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.600]
uh...

[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:56.540]

[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:57.280]
Poor P.D.

[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:58.760]
He was wondering

[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:02.860]
why no one ever talked to me.

[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:03.960]
He was family.

[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.700]
And sketch really.

[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:08.300]
And he said he was really good.

[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:10.240]
And he's really good.

[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.200]
I'm gonna go home.

[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.900]
I'm gonna go home.

[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:25.380]
Should we just go home and see that, or have a meet

[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:26.880]
sad about that?

[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:30.520]
The obvious is T into my mind.

[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:31.920]
A short while ago,

[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:32.740]
the H.D.

[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:33.280]
Anthem's a withdrawal

[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:33.280]

[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:33.280]

[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:33.280]

[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:35.880]
Doge is shaking

[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:38.300]
Oh C.D.

[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:40.100]
Well thats B!

[00:54:52.200 --> 00:55:05.880]
She'll wait underneath and find something

[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:09.860]
She or went straight

[00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:10.080]
Through she can see

[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:10.080]

[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:10.080]

[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:10.080]

[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:10.080]

[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:18.580]
one of the

[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:18.700]
the

[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:19.160]
the

[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:19.680]
and

[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:19.680]

[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.560]
horrendous formatics and as long

[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:30.780]
long commercial breaks that

[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:31.200]
even though they're

[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.400]
cumes increasing which means

[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.360]
we have more people listening

[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.780]
their average quarter hour share

[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:36.420]
is falling dramatically both in

[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:37.980]
a morning and hank show because

[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:38.980]
the lack of the list is

[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:39.500]
it is

[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.380]
windling because people can only

[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.400]
endure so many of those ten

[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:43.600]
and thirteen-minute breaks you

[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.720]
think that we can expect off to

[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.020]

[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:46.860]

[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:07.720]
name any of those people and there was something maybe they were pretty nice people too

[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.860]
some of our kids there were like three kids in that one family and they're all dead

[00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:12.680]
they might have been a real nice kids for all we know

[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:17.880]
does anybody know who they were no one say this this idea that because somebody

[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:23.180]
famous died somebody who was a golfer i mean he didn't change you know i'm sure he

[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:26.160]
was a very nice guy from everything i'm hearing but he didn't change the course of

[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:29.640]
human events you know like here's john chaffee even though he was an old guy he was

[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:33.020]
a governor three times he was the senator for 23 years from Rhode Island

[00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:37.580]
and nobody even knows who the hell he is right and what's wrong with america sir

[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:41.720]
right and i don't know if you know who the agent who was also on board who

[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:45.560]

Carroll is one of his clients for the pitch perch steel is i don't know if that

[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:52.780]
that gets mentioned too much he was also on the plane well so i haven't heard a word

[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:58.200]
about it yeah so no like that i guess maybe he wasn't a good guy i guess not

[00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:04.020]
all right nice talking to you and have a great day pal thank you yeah just because somebody is

[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:08.760]
a celebrity doesn't make their life more meaningful than yours oh my god there's another one of

[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:12.120]
those crazy things you keep saying Neil you keep saying stuff like that you're going to burn in hell

[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:20.280]
just because you were a celebrity i mean famous i mean if it's a famous world leader who

[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:24.720]
affects like millions or billions of people's lives then okay of course it's a tremendous

[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:34.280]
news story you know when what's his name when uh king Hussein died of course we knew he was

[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:38.000]
dying anyway he's done like a huge but hungry with his public dying with cancer but when he died

[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.380]
and by most accounts he was a pretty good guy especially in a part of the world where we have a

[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:48.820]
lot of crazy people a lot of extreme he was a moderate guy never stole a freight train never

[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:53.960]
stole any halifaz what they tell me and there wasn't anywhere near the cemestive if you pardon

[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:59.780]
that expression when he died as there was with pain steward died do you think if you went out

[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:05.000]
there to the day land right now and you asked a hundred people just in random who was king Hussein

[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.380]
of Jordan and they were looking to you and you know and they probably would go like that day land

[01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:15.720]
that's what's there how about the saw grad oh that's the same difference is there any place left

[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.760]
down here no like i said if you went out of homestead

[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.560]
king Hussein what's that what's that that a candy bar

[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:38.140]
here's a collar and Miami Beach oh Miami Beach hello yes sir uh i killed me off guard i'm an old

[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:42.120]
kood on Miami Beach that's what it says here old kood and Miami Beach that's exactly what it says

[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:46.760]
i was surfing last night and i saw a come you were surfing and Miami Beach an old kood

[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:51.920]
surfing that's the way we like it and i saw a couple of comments from this guy gray saying that he

[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:57.100]
thought his his questions were timely and pertinent yeah well he's full of crap yeah he'd maybe he could

[01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:00.600]
have been a passenger with mr steward that would have been good in fact maybe he could have replaced him

[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:06.340]
maybe so god bless you god bless you and have a ground for you for it bye bye thank you there's a good

[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:10.400]
point maybe he should have been on a plane gym gray okay is there anybody opposed to that no okay let's

[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:16.820]
let's turn the clock back about 26 hours and uh change the a passenger change the composition in fact

[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:22.040]
let's just put Jim grander by himself and anybody who's apologizing for him too including uh let's see

[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:27.380]
who was it they wrote that it was the best interview he ever saw in his life some asshole um

[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:33.920]
Murray chast baseball writer for the New York Times the best tv interview he's ever seen

[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:38.120]
Murray you should rot in hell with Jim gray okay you should have been up there and that god damn plane

[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:44.840]
on that queer alir jet that's right but most of the critics really ripped him an ass

[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.580]
Bob raceman of the new york daily news said it was the case of a reporter trying to become the moment

[01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:58.620]
and make himself bigger than the game feel machnik of the post called it a mugging and the overwhelming

[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:04.360]
majority of people with a half a brain said to you okay of course Jim Dow the investigator

[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:08.800]
was 89 investigation led to the ban and that famous dowry port said gray had more guts than any guy

[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:14.620]
I've ever seen I mean here's the guy that they bring in finally after 10 years they say okay we

[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:18.420]
know everybody the fans love you but that we have to be goody two shoes we're against gambling

[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:22.620]
because it makes us look like a bunch of crooks which most of us are anyway and they give him a big

[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:27.260]
old vision and now we have to analyze the old vision they were really uh they were really cheering

[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:31.680]
for the martyr Pete Rose not for the athlete that's what Greg Kotex writes anybody believe that

[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:38.740]
no of course not he was great okay he didn't just get 3000 hits which is like the benchmark

[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:46.440]
for the greatest baseball but he had 4200 and some odd hits he was a hard nose tough plan

[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:51.900]
mean as impossible to get out god damn ball player which is what it's supposed to be all about

[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:56.520]
I mean if you're gonna take all the scumbags out of sports uh okay I guess most sports end

[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:01.480]
to bar this station will be playing Hungarian melodies on the Friday yeah if you take most of

[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:06.960]
the scumbags out of sports and then freaking Darryl Strawberry he's got the girl to open up a mouth

[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:12.320]
and have an opinion on this how come Jim great don't walk up the Darryl Strawberry there

[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:16.900]
in the Yankee dugout and interview him and say hey Darryl how many times you think how many more

[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:22.420]
chances you think we're gonna get you crack snorting a piece of turd you scumbag how many more

[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:26.680]
then of course we all be saying nice calling Jim because you'd have a point

[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:37.540]
here's a guy who had a gambling problem oh wow I wonder what would happen if Jim

[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:42.660]
Gray interviewed Ed Kaplan huh talking about a guy with a gambling problem

[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:51.060]
here's a mobile invoker hello hey Neil how you doing okay sir a couple years ago

[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:57.480]
speaking about Jim Gray I had the unfortunate pleasure he's an asshole yeah of meeting him I came

[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:02.560]
up to him you know just out of I don't know just to say hi how you doing I watch MTV I think you

[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:08.480]
know you do a good job he's like yeah yeah thanks a lot he walks out like he's a star he's got

[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:14.000]
a star he's a little damn interviewer yeah come on and then he did this or he just wants some

[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.640]
fame big time doesn't he big okay thank you what did he say I wasn't paying any attention oh I

[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:23.720]
sure hope that Bob McKay isn't dispatching it the same stuff that we got yesterday all over again

[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:28.160]
because that's what it looks like to me that would be really bad you know and if that's what he's

[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:35.060]
doing here oh this this place hey there's there's just no hope you know there's just no hope for this

[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:39.900]
joint they just don't care I've told you that for two years and everybody thinks that I'm joking

[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:43.280]
that I'm making it up and it's a show material you know oh that's really great show material

[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:47.880]
yeah I think there's no care they're oblivious to anything that has to do with this business

[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:54.680]
I think if I stay out for a couple of months they might start curing starting tomorrow maybe

[01:05:55.780 --> 01:06:00.860]

[01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:39.470]
just just oh nauseated by it grossed out by it all these horrendous things going on and then of

[01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:43.030]
course we had the one guy called to tell us why I should be upset that pain store died because he

[01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:46.810]
was a born again Christian not a god in atheist or Jew or Catholic that we're all gonna burn the hell

[01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:51.030]
that's why we should be upset about it don't you just love people like that yeah

[01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:58.710]
five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on the AT&T wireless line I'm going to disco after

[01:18:58.710 --> 01:19:03.030]
afternoon I'm starting playing disco today because I guarantee you we'll get better response

[01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:08.870]
that we're getting here today very weak here's a mobile and deer field hello hello yes sir how you

[01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:14.590]
doing today okay yeah I just like to make a comment well one that that Felicia boy over there

[01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:19.870]
like not about my human stead pal but anyway why is it I said for the Felicia guy over there I

[01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:24.310]
like to then to knock him out for you for a couple of goalscreen reader cup tickets over there I

[01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:27.890]
don't know what that guy's thinking about you shouldn't be calling on a sports talk show that's

[01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:32.870]
for sure isn't the sports talk show sir well talking about sports or whatever anyway this is not

[01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:36.570]
high rated show this isn't the sports talk show this is the new world you're showing out of

[01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:40.970]
sports what I'm going to do is an effort to sports and would be gambling for a peak row left

[01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:45.490]
not sports that's that's human interest okay well that's fine we'll go along with every what you

[01:19:45.490 --> 01:19:49.850]
want to call it but also gambling can be called a business there's a lot of people out here that

[01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:54.390]
you know that liver died by this game and you know peak rows could be one of them it's not a

[01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:58.270]
problem or anything like that it's a bottle to market it's a business it's open seven days a week

[01:19:58.270 --> 01:20:02.890]
24 hours a day it's a multi-billion dollar industry right and you know the man should have

[01:20:02.890 --> 01:20:06.510]
some respect for that and I just wanted to call in support that I don't think it's no major deal

[01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:11.230]
about somebody making a few waiters here they're not saying again he never bet against his own

[01:20:11.230 --> 01:20:16.110]
team it's not like he threw games like the 1919 black socks the collector was a big scandal that

[01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:20.630]
everybody accused him of betting against his team and trying to see that his team lost that

[01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:24.650]
would be a that would be a scandal that probably he'd never be forgiven for but nobody's he never

[01:20:24.650 --> 01:20:30.270]
accused him of doing that exactly he's just into it for the interest of the game and like I

[01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:34.830]
said a business I mean it's just like making a major investment in a stock or anything else

[01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:38.550]
well I wouldn't say that I say he's got a gambling problem what what's the big deal with that there

[01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:41.550]
a lot of people gambling problems are some people with a drinking problem that doesn't mean they throw

[01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:45.510]
them out of sports yeah well yeah there's plenty of problems with people with 20 problems people

[01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:51.370]
with drug problems exactly so he said 85 chances he was out there he was at the in the line-up

[01:20:51.370 --> 01:20:56.370]
the other night he was playing exactly like I said before why didn't Jim Gray forget about

[01:20:56.370 --> 01:20:59.910]
Pete Rosen run over the Yankee dugout and give a grilling to Darryl strawberry he'd got a

[01:20:59.910 --> 01:21:05.330]
standing ovation for that I agree and there you go right on the field as you're looking at it

[01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:08.290]
and Pete Rosen now who would you who would you rather associate with somebody that may have a

[01:21:08.290 --> 01:21:13.550]
little gambling problem or somebody that's a co-caduct I would rather associate with a business man

[01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:18.410]
that's involved in the gambling industry personally as like you said you see Pete rose over at the

[01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:22.710]
pompinal park I sheen up the Palm Beach County Club I think down at the club that's called

[01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:27.370]
there's a bunch of next brains out I see him I see him up at the Gulf Stream Park up there at the

[01:21:27.370 --> 01:21:32.930]
third club I mean he's asking well yes and it's his money so if he wants to lose it like I said

[01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:37.030]
it's his business not Jim Gray's God then business it's it's not his business get cut the guy

[01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:41.890]
some slack already for Christ say he's a human being and ever stole a freight train right put him put

[01:21:41.890 --> 01:21:48.790]
him in the hall of fame right God bless you sir and I'll pray for you businessman is he a

[01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:55.110]
businessman no he's a five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line he

[01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:58.610]
just no passion in this town I've said it a million times I'll say it again that guy at least had

[01:21:58.610 --> 01:22:04.370]
some passion nice going pal at least that guy had some strong feelings about something I guarantee

[01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:08.190]
they didn't get any calls from soft floor well I one guy to call yesterday said he called NBC New York

[01:22:08.190 --> 01:22:13.150]
because he was pissed at Jim Gray and the network he's the only one doesn't happen down here

[01:22:13.150 --> 01:22:17.890]
because they're not highly motivated about that it has no there's nothing free in it for him

[01:22:19.290 --> 01:22:22.770]
by the way Pavell Brey better be playing tomorrow night I want how about those maple leaves huh

[01:22:22.770 --> 01:22:28.410]
I'm going Kujo for nothing shut out over wounded Dallas team last night we'll take the two points

[01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:44.890]

[01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:35.950]
Vegas driving a limo with all the big shots and the celebrities out there that would be a great job

[01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:40.610]
be very lucrative I just hope I can stay away from the tables and from the slot machines you won't

mobile in Miami hi how are you okay sir hi Neil a couple things this feet resting this is

[01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:25.170]
like sick this guy used to watch him when I was younger he was the greatest baseball player I've

[01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:32.570]
ever seen probably and he didn't set on the game like he said and you know what is an OJ Simpson

[01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:37.830]
in the Hall of Fame yeah okay so should they kick his butt out that's a murder see the football

[01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:41.370]
football you know what I mean you know what I mean I'm gonna play on the guy that you never you never

[01:24:41.370 --> 01:24:46.570]
get on top you know talk to you a week ago but did you hear that thing on it was on the EID network

[01:24:46.570 --> 01:24:55.470]
news that American Airlines there was a EID network and rape on the plane and the FBI came to the

[01:24:55.470 --> 01:25:00.330]
airport tried to stop the plane asked the American Airlines to police stop the plane and they pulled him

[01:25:00.330 --> 01:25:05.930]
no that's I saw that and we talked about and they let the guy go and now they can't find them

[01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:09.890]
so they're gonna get fine so I thought that make you happy to know that American Airlines

[01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:13.850]
gonna be hit with some major fall he's probably working as a ramp right over in my A right now

[01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:19.390]

[01:25:30.170 --> 01:25:35.290]
way all week long can't you you can just feel it you can smell it in this town they go through these

[01:25:35.290 --> 01:25:39.510]
cycles no matter what the hell it is all I'm asking is a very simple question why should we care

[01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:43.230]
here about painstores that other than you know it's unfortunate when somebody dies before their

[01:25:43.230 --> 01:25:48.090]
time maybe it was his time that's what the religious nuts always tell us god it was his time

[01:25:48.090 --> 01:25:55.950]
so why should we be sad about it then here's a mobile in western hello hi Neil yes sir I got

[01:25:55.950 --> 01:26:02.470]
a your two topics today I agree with one and disagree with the other the first is Jim Gray that

[01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:08.570]
a balding turd who's never I don't know what he's ever done you know never put his you know

[01:26:09.370 --> 01:26:13.430]
is asked on the line and never a hard nose nothing

[01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:19.170]
to ask those questions of key roads which we've already been over it you know this is not

[01:26:19.170 --> 01:26:24.550]
something that happened two weeks ago right he should have stuck that microphone in his you know what

[01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:32.150]
back down yeah and I mean Gerald strawberries on the bench who does blow and she thought his wife

[01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:38.730]
Jay howl and ex Yankee had about eight chances and his drugs all the time George Steinbrenner

[01:26:38.730 --> 01:26:46.010]
got banned from baseball he's back in everybody's forgetting yeah except him but what I do disagree

[01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:55.070]
about is the painstored I mean it is disagree about what I said it's you and your producer George

[01:26:55.070 --> 01:27:00.450]
that went down on a flight yeah what would the story in the herald be about George's career and

[01:27:00.450 --> 01:27:06.590]
it would be about you that he started his career down here and it ran for several years and he was

[01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:13.890]
successful radio celebrity I mean no offense to George but the story wouldn't be about him yeah it

[01:27:13.890 --> 01:27:18.950]
would because you have more no notoriety so I mean to save it I think there would be a little bit

[01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:22.130]
more about him than there was about the other four or five people that died on his plane there was

[01:27:22.130 --> 01:27:26.650]
like nothing yeah I mean they they mentioned their name but what do you want them to you want to run

[01:27:26.650 --> 01:27:34.130]
the cover of USA today on Joe Smith who you know is well how about the local papers given us a

[01:27:34.130 --> 01:27:37.370]
little more information on the people that died in Hurricane Irene the people that got the

[01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:42.690]
electrocuted yeah people die every day and I mean it doesn't it I well aren't they important

[01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:12.950]
a good nose we found out the babbling brook persons 25 to 54 when the afternoon in the spring

[01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:36.150]
in a morning at a point nine in the afternoon in people 20 in our target demographic persons 25 to 54

[01:31:37.250 --> 01:31:44.050]
all I can say is oh my god wow I'm trying I'm getting so tired of seeing this every time six seven

[01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:47.230]
lines lit up we go into the break in the year then there are one then there are two it just

[01:31:47.230 --> 01:31:53.530]
this audience has got no patience god damn it they got it they got important stuff going on

[01:31:53.530 --> 01:32:00.070]
there do I believe that no five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line

[01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:03.930]
here's a mobile and four-letter deal hello hey Neil yes sir

[01:32:03.930 --> 01:32:07.890]
you don't think I'll tell you about a piece to it you know every time you want to drop

[01:32:07.890 --> 01:32:11.290]
to him and he was one of these born-again guys it's all you talked about with Jesus okay yeah

[01:32:11.290 --> 01:32:15.290]
but when they interviewed him but when they interviewed him you know once will they interview a star

[01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:19.110]
if they come in second they usually do it once while they will he never talked about how Jesus

[01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:22.930]
helped him come second you know he only had told my help him coming first uh huh I don't

[01:32:22.930 --> 01:32:28.110]
I don't understand that do you know you know I'm saying so let me say he used up all to say this

[01:32:28.110 --> 01:32:32.430]
is uh for the flight yesterday pretty sad that when a born-again Christian dies you know but you

[01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:36.250]
don't say he never these guys never if you see the football whatever all they do is talk about

[01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:40.190]
like if they win if they lose they never talk about it right they never bring it up how Jesus didn't

[01:32:40.190 --> 01:32:44.970]
help them come second or lose or whatever uh huh that's what it bothers me you know the revolution

[01:32:44.970 --> 01:32:48.810]
really has nothing to do I'll come to God that doesn't get beat to it doesn't say well god damn God

[01:32:48.810 --> 01:32:52.730]
you know I know but you treat but do you agree you know I'm saying they don't talk about it that's

[01:32:52.730 --> 01:32:58.710]
correct they don't bring it up so you like Jackie Mason he's okay for an award he's on he's coming

[01:32:58.710 --> 01:33:04.550]
to town in 10 days the comedy club my only okay I can't wait have a good time see you bye bye yeah he was

[01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:08.250]
okay about a hundred years ago Jackie Mason he's still doing that same old type stick and his TV show

[01:33:08.250 --> 01:33:13.950]
was on about five hundred five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T Rival Slime

[01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:18.550]
doesn't the catch their fancy day into this stuff about pain Stewart about Pete Rose about Jim Gray

[01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:24.350]
about all the other eight million things that I talked about here today including the Baptist

[01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:28.490]
Dealer in the money oh by the way here's the good news Broward may lure the Latin Grammy Awards

[01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:34.090]
because after all we can't have no Cuban performers in Dade County that's right and Michael

[01:33:34.090 --> 01:33:38.210]
Green president and CEO of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences said in Los Angeles

[01:33:38.210 --> 01:33:42.990]
last week we will not hold a Latin Grammy show where Cuban artists cannot perform so that leaves a

[01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:46.710]
Miami uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so maybe they'll wind up in Broward or somewhere else maybe

[01:33:46.710 --> 01:33:51.930]
in LA but certainly not in Miami no no say Abel English are key

[01:33:54.330 --> 01:33:58.050]
they you're right though I can understand why nobody talks about that because it's hopeless and

[01:33:58.050 --> 01:34:02.350]
what's the point it's a banana republic it's run by a bunch of crooks and there's nothing we can do

[01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:06.310]
about it except when they do try to put one over under public like that election last July we just

[01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:09.850]
make sure everybody goes out and votes no and then of course when Mayor penis has to run again

[01:34:09.850 --> 01:34:15.250]
they'll all vote no to him too get somebody else some other crook in there nice going babbling brook

[01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:21.030]
grams with crook a 0.9 out of 50 pounds a month I guarantee you I could have my little dog farting

[01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:28.270]
in there for four hours and get a bigger number than that I guarantee it oh here's Larry Brooks

[01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:34.370]
old producer what the f here I am how you doing Larry I think pussy that's me what is it

[01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:38.310]
manic I don't know what you call me manic pussy and that would that hurt you you to call me

[01:34:38.970 --> 01:34:43.970]
I don't even know who you are manic manic Larry Larry Baker's a Brooks former producer I have no

[01:34:43.970 --> 01:34:48.150]
idea who you are Larry I ever met you do I know you I don't even know who you are exactly so how

[01:34:48.150 --> 01:34:52.930]
could I have called you anything I just called to uh to rejoice yeah open up the old dump

[01:34:52.930 --> 01:34:59.770]
are you celebrating a bean out of that station or just a grade 0.9 share that brook had in the

[01:34:59.770 --> 01:35:04.770]
summer book combinations of course it's your fault you do realize that Larry every time she's

[01:35:04.770 --> 01:35:08.130]
got a crappy book which has been every time she's been in the market it's always the producers fall

[01:35:08.130 --> 01:35:11.830]
if you would have just lined up some good topics and some good guests and give it her some food for

[01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:15.970]
thought in some more better wax she doesn't need any extra food for thought of you know what I mean

[01:35:15.970 --> 01:35:21.350]
obviously yeah but uh yet's my fault too she said the f word right yeah now was that was that a

[01:35:21.850 --> 01:35:26.450]
set up thing was that like you know going out of set up thing at all yeah I was just well what

[01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:30.330]
kind of a bitch goes on a year and says that man doesn't dump herself she didn't realize she said it

[01:35:30.330 --> 01:35:34.330]
this she didn't what kind of a station let her back on the air the very next day after she didn't

[01:35:34.330 --> 01:35:39.790]
even realize she could do something like that didn't even get suspended not even suspended not even

[01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:46.850]
a slap on the big fat ass yeah oh my god rectum huh so anyway I just believe the margin of

[01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:52.250]
error according to arbitrage is like a a 0.80 so even a mistake could get a 0.8 right or that's

[01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:57.870]
correct that is absolutely correct so probably if you subtract the mistake she's got a 0.1

[01:35:58.350 --> 01:36:03.390]
she was very supportive throughout the whole issue obviously yeah I think I got to call

[01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:07.130]
to say how you doing uh call me at the radio stage so how are they doing over there at the

[01:36:07.130 --> 01:36:12.910]
queer channel by the way it's a mess it's it's all it's all syndication yeah and uh you know

[01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:18.610]
working for the anti-Christ over there Dave Roth uh don't leave people to rob right all people

[01:36:18.610 --> 01:36:23.310]
now who was it that far he was it her was it people to the first uh I got suspended by

[01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:27.870]
people to and then officially terminated for talking to the press by uh the interview this Dave

[01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:34.350]
uh Ross oh oh by Dave Ross himself wow that's something you can write in their Mars and during

[01:36:34.350 --> 01:36:39.490]
the meeting he had with me the oh he uh he he wanted to know why originally when Brooks said

[01:36:39.490 --> 01:36:44.450]
the f-word why I tried to make up a white lie is to possibly that she might have dumped the uh the

[01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:48.690]
word uh he said why would you do that why would you you know make up a lie to management as a

[01:36:48.690 --> 01:36:53.090]
Dave you've spent your entire career lying to everybody that's how you got where you are right

[01:36:53.090 --> 01:36:56.750]
you should understand I was protecting her big fat ass that's what I was trying to do

[01:36:56.750 --> 01:37:02.310]
underlying fat ass part yeah right but you didn't understand that yeah well congratulations

[01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:05.530]
Larry it's always all the people that get out of queer channel they generally go and have a big

[01:37:05.530 --> 01:37:10.370]
party I think you should be in there time I would imagine that uh you know I don't understand how

[01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:16.350]
she's down to by the way one life endorsement for shows she used to have 12 oh hey well not too

[01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:19.610]
many people want to show that's got an invisible audience I would you spend it because they chart

[01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:25.590]
$7,000 for a 13-week contract why would you spend your money on a show that has a point nine yeah

[01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:30.710]
exactly good point well listen Larry best of luck you and congratulations thank you Neil yeah

[01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:36.170]

[01:37:40.770 --> 01:37:46.130]
he said and a no talent slut nobody just said uh nothing like that and she'd only croak pretty

[01:37:46.130 --> 01:37:49.850]
sure he said that and he said he wished it was her up in a plane instead of poor pain stored

[01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:55.290]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eight in fact Hank says we don't want her

[01:41:26.110 --> 01:41:27.570]

[01:41:28.130 --> 01:41:31.330]
Way way down there 3 to 7 p.m. Come on sweetheart. You can do it

[01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:35.850]
She's beaten up by station that have side off the year already

[01:41:36.650 --> 01:41:37.050]

[01:41:57.610 --> 01:42:02.850]
The fact that yeah oops the fact that kiss at a 5.2 and men in 3 to 7 p.m. Hank at a 4.9

[01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:07.990]
The only difference being Hank is non 3 to 70's on 2 to 6 and I'm sure he had more than a 5.2 from 2 to 6

[01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:09.770]
Right there you go. He probably edge job

[01:42:10.630 --> 01:42:15.710]

a 0.9

[01:43:01.890 --> 01:43:07.050]
Dropping from a 1.7 which am much to a 0.9 is like losing 50% of the audience of the share

[01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:13.150]
Pied for 20 turd in the market you turd exactly

[01:44:14.610 --> 01:44:18.130]

[01:44:18.130 --> 01:44:23.030]
Thank you so much. You're about the only guy that cares enough now these people all of a sudden the last year or so they got real busy

[01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:26.470]
You know that me nail on the hanger owner pal good for you

[01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:32.490]
This paint store thing. Yeah, I'm out there this old bony again Christian stuff to everything

[01:44:32.490 --> 01:44:38.350]
Yes, that's not why you know why because he get he gave back. That's why yeah

[01:44:38.350 --> 01:44:41.730]
He did a lady did a lot of charity work and just like you

[01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:46.830]
What do you think when something happens to you in another 50 years? You think people aren't gonna miss you

[01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:49.890]
You give back. No, it's not a question missing me, but I don't think it'll be on the front

[01:44:49.890 --> 01:44:54.690]
You give back it'll be on CNN you give back you get the community something. I mean you take

[01:44:54.690 --> 01:44:59.010]
Yeah, and give back and that's what this guy did take a lot give a little take a lot

[01:44:59.010 --> 01:45:04.510]
Well, I take a little give a lot. Oh, well, that's right. I don't know if I take any I don't know if I get any

[01:45:05.690 --> 01:45:08.610]
but I think that's the biggest reason

[01:45:10.130 --> 01:45:14.490]
Wild miss him not because he's a great guy for a great. I mean, he was a great is a nice person

[01:45:14.490 --> 01:45:18.490]
Yeah, I bet you John Chafee the senator who died yesterday from Rhode Island. I bet she was pretty nice

[01:45:18.490 --> 01:45:23.450]
Sure, I hear and I don't think I don't but nobody that I went there were like 10 words about him

[01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:27.290]
I'm the news all day long. I got playing it was a painstored this all day long

[01:45:27.690 --> 01:45:32.990]
But you know you mentioned the seven kids and why they don't make a big deal out of that yeah, I think they don't make a big deal

[01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:39.470]
I think they're embarrassed who came on before those kids died and said don't walk in puddles because there's live wires

[01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:40.690]
Nobody that's right

[01:45:40.690 --> 01:45:44.710]
One stage came on and said that we were gonna have massive flooding and if people would be without power

[01:45:44.710 --> 01:45:50.150]
For like maybe two days and you know the guy your call is a couple of them were beating up Don know

[01:45:50.810 --> 01:45:55.210]
Don knows the first one who said that the tale of the thing look like when it was down

[01:45:55.210 --> 01:46:00.190]
By Cuba said that the tale of thing looks like it's going east. Yeah, so you know

[01:46:00.190 --> 01:46:02.270]
You know that then you get 20

[01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:08.370]
I'm saying the guy killed time say that right. That's right. I mean, I wasn't here. Thank God. I got to out of here

[01:46:08.370 --> 01:46:12.750]
I must have five acres and you know what you always take it was smarter than the rest. That's right and I am

[01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:17.110]
Okay, pal have a great. I know you're so much for hanging up. God bless you. I'll pray for us

[01:46:17.710 --> 01:46:22.270]
Okay, there's a guy to wait at 23 and a half minutes just for the privilege of coming on here and saying a few words good guy

[01:46:22.770 --> 01:46:23.990]

[01:46:24.690 --> 01:46:28.090]
Where's to these people look at that? Oh every line was looked there for about two seconds, right?

[01:46:29.670 --> 01:46:30.770]
They just won't wait again

[01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:35.030]
Now you know, it's gonna it's gonna come to the time in about three months when I hang it up and your people are gonna be oh

[01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:39.150]

[01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:45.270]
Won't be at the pizza loft tonight six days a clock and based on this response I'm getting here today. We should have a real

[01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:46.230]
turnout

[01:46:47.690 --> 01:46:49.670]
You know what I'm saying two or three

[01:46:50.350 --> 01:46:55.730]
Stragories the guy with the eyes will be there. Oh, oh don't say that. No, please guy with the eyes. We don't want to see you

[01:46:55.730 --> 01:47:01.190]
We don't want to see you are no he doesn't need to be there. He was already at the saw grass. Okay. He already got his stuff

[01:47:01.190 --> 01:47:05.410]
He already did his thing. We don't want to know. We don't want to see him

[01:47:05.790 --> 01:47:08.670]
We don't want to see him. You know who else we don't want to see tonight

[01:47:09.330 --> 01:47:13.750]
That's that's it and the guy with a fanny pack. We don't want to see him for the kid

[01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:18.670]
Block then we definitely don't want to see him unless he brushes his teeth

[01:47:18.670 --> 01:47:23.270]
Now we don't want to see him which is their girlfriend. No, definitely don't want to see that whatever that was

[01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:26.090]
No, we want to see some new and different people

[01:47:26.090 --> 01:47:29.110]
You know would be nice and by the way if you bought the best of any have a defective CD

[01:47:29.110 --> 01:47:33.030]
Which if you bought the original day you do probably do you can take it back to where you bought it?

[01:47:33.130 --> 01:47:36.270]
Especially you can bring it by tonight. We'll swap it for you and say hello again

[01:47:36.270 --> 01:47:40.970]
You know I'm saying Jacob maybe Jay now. Let's make a list of the people that we do want to come by tonight like Jacob

[01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:46.870]
And like Jacob and like Jacob and that blog with a tan and the blonde guy with a tan as well the blonde girl with the

[01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:49.050]
The blonde guy with a tan. I don't know

[01:47:49.050 --> 01:47:54.910]
You can have the blonde girl with a tan. I'll take the blonde guy with a tan and the guy who's the fight packing guy you can come by again

[01:47:55.970 --> 01:48:00.310]
And by the way the kid that called before like I said practice on a button mushroom. Okay, it'll be closer to the truth

[01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:08.530]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the yeah, he maybe can write us out a biography. I feel a little to button mushroom

[01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:11.950]
Here's a mobile and Tady hello

[01:48:12.750 --> 01:48:13.810]
Hello, yes, sir

[01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:18.050]
In regards to the feed rows interview by Gray. Yes, sir

[01:48:18.610 --> 01:48:19.170]
When you

[01:48:20.150 --> 01:48:25.670]
Don't like someone and you're against them you put your backbone on the line and stayed it over the air

[01:48:25.670 --> 01:48:33.670]
I want to see how many people in sports in all different sports will be will refuse to have an interview

[01:48:34.290 --> 01:48:40.970]
By Gray and if that takes place I inside of a month he'd be out of a job good, then that should happen

[01:48:40.970 --> 01:48:46.830]
They should all just say no to Jim Gray because like so many people have said there have been a he's given a

[01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:48.850]
Pete Rose has been interviewed by him a million times

[01:48:48.850 --> 01:48:51.950]
There's a time and a place for those kind of questions in that kind of discussion

[01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:57.170]
This was neither the time of the place and anybody with a half a brain knew that it didn't even have to be brought up on education

[01:48:57.170 --> 01:48:59.770]
This wasn't the time to be bringing that up. This was a celebration

[01:48:59.770 --> 01:49:03.330]
This was a special event the fans were into it. They were excited to see him there

[01:49:03.330 --> 01:49:05.690]
There was no reason to have to beat him over the head with us again

[01:49:05.690 --> 01:49:08.850]
He's already beaten up 50 million times with this right

[01:49:08.850 --> 01:49:10.910]
Besides me, I sit about 12

[01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:17.910]
12 feet behind you at the hockey games and I and lots of luck to you and let's hope pop-ups playing tomorrow night

[01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:21.170]
I doubt it they've been stringing us along every game

[01:49:21.170 --> 01:49:25.770]
In fact it's ridiculous. Yeah, I know it's you starting to have that feeling, aren't you?

[01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:33.190]
Thank you and have a great day. Yeah, see a lot of us are starting to believe I don't want to accuse the organization of trying to lead us down to garden path

[01:49:33.190 --> 01:49:37.530]
But it would be nice to know for sure and of course they keep saying well only pop-up knows when he'll be back

[01:49:37.530 --> 01:49:40.450]
You know for 10 million year it'll be nice for you to tell us if you're going to be back

[01:49:40.450 --> 01:49:42.990]
So a lot of people who otherwise might not show up there tomorrow night

[01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:45.490]
We'd like to be there and see the most exciting player in the world

[01:49:45.490 --> 01:49:47.110]
But we'd like to know if he's going to be back

[01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:51.810]
He practiced yesterday. He skated like the wind great. That sounds promising

[01:49:51.810 --> 01:49:56.690]
We want to know is he going to play tomorrow night? Inquiring minds want to know before they win their tangible

[01:49:57.210 --> 01:49:58.490]
very expensive support

[01:50:01.530 --> 01:50:04.470]
56705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless lines

[01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:10.350]
They don't like a lot of these things that that's over the years that I'm glad I always bring these things up things that make people very uncomfortable

[01:50:10.930 --> 01:50:14.870]
Like about why guys in sports pat each other on the ass and why they can do that why didn't do that?

[01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:18.290]
You know, it's a faggy thing they won't talk about that like a fraternity thing

[01:50:20.370 --> 01:50:24.650]
And like this thing about celebrities when celebrities die whether it's sports celebrities or

[01:50:25.290 --> 01:50:27.610]
Hollywood celebrities when they die it's a big song events

[01:50:27.610 --> 01:50:32.570]
It's on the front page when people are probably contributed to hell of a lot more to society like senator chafi when they die

[01:50:32.570 --> 01:50:33.790]
It's like who cares

[01:50:36.410 --> 01:50:38.490]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[01:50:38.490 --> 01:50:40.250]
Big report. Yes, sir

There you go four warned is four armed

[01:50:54.170 --> 01:51:00.690]
56705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line. It's just the desperate last couple days. I mean what am I going to do? I guess a little music might

[01:51:03.450 --> 01:51:09.910]
It's a kid's worry on our 96. Hi, Scott pop get jury. He got a sub honest

[01:51:10.650 --> 01:51:11.350]
Let's hear it for the kid

[01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:21.490]
Yeah, like I said he wouldn't know the goddamn Bravo all stars from what you poop it

Thinking of a fake road love is bad.

[01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:28.890]
You don't leave out the film, can you tell where it is?

[01:52:30.850 --> 01:52:39.890]
And go, and go, and go, and go, and go, and go, and go.

[01:52:43.970 --> 01:52:47.210]
The girls are kind of listening, fat guys.

[01:52:49.470 --> 01:52:52.630]
You know how to make the boldest rise.

[01:52:54.590 --> 01:52:57.690]
That's the taste of the shouting of the house.

[01:52:59.050 --> 01:53:02.650]
We would leave the skis falling on the tower.

[01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:13.390]
And go, and go, and go, and go, and go, and go, and go, and go.

[01:53:26.350 --> 01:53:28.770]
Okay, 12.32 at 5.16 WDQAM.

[01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:30.830]
Take a look at this.

[01:53:30.990 --> 01:53:33.970]
Do you see what's number one, 12 plus the overall audience in the morning in this market?

[01:53:34.270 --> 01:53:35.030]
Radio Amor.

[01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:37.170]
See, that's why I don't understand how we do this.

[01:53:37.650 --> 01:53:43.250]
We're up against all this ethnic craft, and we're still kicking ass.

[01:53:43.950 --> 01:53:45.810]
Can't get any calls, but we're still kicking ass.

[01:53:45.930 --> 01:53:47.290]
Of course, it's been that way for 23 years.

[01:53:47.290 --> 01:53:51.690]
While you're so intimidating, the old nobody, they don't have the balls to talk to you, to argue with you,

[01:53:51.790 --> 01:53:54.290]
because you make so much sense, and because you're so macho.

[01:53:55.710 --> 01:53:57.370]
Yeah, they're afraid of an old fag like me.

[01:53:57.490 --> 01:53:58.090]
How do you like that?

[01:53:58.230 --> 01:53:59.850]
They're too intimidated, because they're much of pussy's.

[01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:04.830]
Well, you know, he was a born again Christian at Painstore at UAE APS.

[01:54:04.930 --> 01:54:05.730]
You're going to burn hell.

[01:54:06.410 --> 01:54:06.550]
Yeah.

[01:54:09.370 --> 01:54:09.930]
5.670560.

[01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.650]
Why tell you one thing?

[01:54:10.710 --> 01:54:12.050]
We're sure we wasted a lot of good facts paper.

[01:54:12.150 --> 01:54:13.110]
Nice call, and Bob McKay.

[01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:14.270]
KISS had a good book.

[01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:18.570]
That must be why he's in such a generous mood to help us out, because he knows how inept we are over here.

[01:54:19.330 --> 01:54:20.130]
Man, look at that.

[01:54:20.250 --> 01:54:23.630]
I got about 600 pages in this scrap right now, most of which I didn't really need.

[01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:25.290]
But I'm scouring.

[01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:27.950]
It's good that I have every page, because I'm looking at each and every page.

[01:54:28.190 --> 01:54:28.750]
I'm looking high.

[01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:30.630]
I'm looking low for WAFN.

[01:54:31.010 --> 01:54:33.170]
That got a front page story by Barry Jack Asshon-Herald.

[01:54:33.330 --> 01:54:35.290]
What a big competitor they were going to be for QAM.

[01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:36.070]
Are they on here anywhere?

[01:54:36.150 --> 01:54:36.290]
No.

[01:54:37.530 --> 01:54:42.850]
They went on in August with that sports format, which means two thirds of this book, two out of the three months they were on there.

[01:54:42.850 --> 01:54:45.770]
So if they had anything, they'd have a fraction, they'd have something.

[01:54:46.010 --> 01:54:48.390]
Is there anything on here to indicate they're even on the year?

[01:54:48.510 --> 01:54:48.710]
No.

[01:54:50.590 --> 01:54:52.190]
That's the kind of competition we love.

[01:54:53.050 --> 01:54:53.590]
Here's Miami.

[01:54:53.690 --> 01:54:53.950]
Hello?

[01:54:55.110 --> 01:54:55.410]
Hello.

[01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:56.310]
Yes, I am.

[01:54:56.710 --> 01:54:57.230]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.450]
Yeah.

[01:54:58.550 --> 01:55:02.290]
Then the truth is the fact that Tiger Woods was on that plane too, or is that just...

[01:55:02.290 --> 01:55:02.530]
Yeah.

[01:55:03.050 --> 01:55:04.810]
Yeah, Tiger Woods, I play it.

[01:55:06.770 --> 01:55:07.650]
Oh, God.

[01:55:13.590 --> 01:55:16.990]
567-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:55:17.130 --> 01:55:17.890]
He's taking up space.

[01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:19.190]
He's breathing.

[01:55:20.250 --> 01:55:21.450]
He's taking up space.

[01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:22.250]
So what do you say?

[01:55:22.370 --> 01:55:23.510]
Let's fertilize some eggs, huh?

[01:55:24.370 --> 01:55:25.430]
You want to fertilize some...

[01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.510]
Huh?

[01:55:26.890 --> 01:55:29.690]
Some good-looking eggs or some ugly, uh, people's eggs?

[01:55:30.430 --> 01:55:32.650]
I still say, I mean, how about somebody with a brain?

[01:55:33.130 --> 01:55:35.070]
How about somebody who looks good and is also smart?

[01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:37.390]
There are such people.

[01:55:37.630 --> 01:55:38.170]
Believe me.

[01:55:39.090 --> 01:55:42.870]
People who actually look good and who have an IQ bigger than their thumbnail.

[01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:47.450]
The, you know, the prospect of this whole thing.

[01:55:47.770 --> 01:55:48.650]
Let's procreate.

[01:55:48.710 --> 01:55:50.510]
Let's reproduce the human race on the Internet.

[01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:52.890]
Let's sterilize everybody else.

[01:55:53.150 --> 01:55:55.270]
And we'll just, you know, further the human race on the Internet.

[01:55:55.450 --> 01:55:56.730]
We'll be real picky and real choosy.

[01:55:57.210 --> 01:55:58.230]
I get to pick by the way.

[01:55:59.010 --> 01:56:00.170]
Here's a mobile and bokeh.

[01:56:00.210 --> 01:56:00.370]
Hello?

[01:56:01.110 --> 01:56:02.290]
Neil, what's going on?

[01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:03.930]
I got to say about Pete Rose and Jim Gray.

[01:56:04.570 --> 01:56:08.150]
I think Jim Gray gave Pete Rose an opportunity to not maybe

[01:56:08.150 --> 01:56:12.430]
say I admitted gambling or just say maybe I made a mistake.

[01:56:13.130 --> 01:56:14.910]
You got to look kind of look at it that way and...

[01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:16.970]
No, you don't have to look at it that way.

[01:56:17.130 --> 01:56:18.570]
He's going to continue denying it.

[01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:20.630]
He's already asking the question eight million times.

[01:56:21.090 --> 01:56:24.190]
You know, to me, Pete Rose, you know, look, he was a great player.

[01:56:24.210 --> 01:56:28.650]
We all loved him as a player, but he's a degenerate gamble like fat head tankalberg.

[01:56:28.910 --> 01:56:30.390]
No, so what about it?

[01:56:30.910 --> 01:56:31.230]
All right.

[01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:33.670]
He wasn't there for their gambling.

[01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:35.050]
It wasn't a casino last night.

[01:56:35.130 --> 01:56:36.110]
It was the World Series today.

[01:56:36.210 --> 01:56:36.370]
I know.

[01:56:36.670 --> 01:56:36.970]
I know.

[01:56:37.370 --> 01:56:40.250]
There were celebrating the best baseball players of all time.

[01:56:40.410 --> 01:56:41.910]
The point, the point that you made about...

[01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:44.930]
Does that make him less than a baseball player?

[01:56:45.130 --> 01:56:52.330]
No, it does it, but you're right about where he took the time and the place to ask Pete Rose about it.

[01:56:52.350 --> 01:56:53.470]
And over and over again.

[01:56:53.610 --> 01:56:57.210]
When he didn't come the first time, that would get him move on to something else.

[01:56:57.610 --> 01:57:00.630]
You think he rose as closer now to the whole of him, closer to Jim Gray?

[01:57:00.970 --> 01:57:01.130]
No.

[01:57:01.890 --> 01:57:02.250]
All right.

[01:57:02.590 --> 01:57:04.150]
And let me ask you, so who cares?

[01:57:04.270 --> 01:57:04.970]
What difference does it make?

[01:57:06.010 --> 01:57:09.370]
The only difference it makes is that it's no Bradley going to be our president.

[01:57:09.570 --> 01:57:09.850]
Yeah.

[01:57:10.210 --> 01:57:11.250]
I hope so.

[01:57:11.250 --> 01:57:11.870]
I don't know.

[01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:13.170]
The polls aren't looking good now.

[01:57:13.310 --> 01:57:14.350]
Gore is starting to pull away again.

[01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:15.730]
Oh, I love you.

[01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:16.510]
Okay, see.

[01:57:16.970 --> 01:57:18.610]
Gore is starting to pull away a big lead yesterday.

[01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:19.030]
This said.

[01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:21.590]
Five, I have no idea.

[01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:24.830]
Maybe actually he ran over and shook somebody's hand at one appearance.

[01:57:24.990 --> 01:57:27.090]
And the fact that he was motivated enough to actually run a few yards.

[01:57:27.090 --> 01:57:28.870]
Maybe that indicated he's actually still alive.

[01:57:29.010 --> 01:57:30.270]
And it's, oh yeah, Al Gore is still alive.

[01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:31.170]
Maybe we'll hope for him.

[01:57:32.490 --> 01:57:33.930]
Like this reform party, boy.

[01:57:33.930 --> 01:57:36.770]
Not Donald Trump.

[01:57:37.290 --> 01:57:39.510]
Pat, I never met an Nazi I didn't like Buchanan.

[01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:43.350]
Ross P. Row was a big year.

[01:57:44.570 --> 01:57:47.810]
And of course our buddy Jesse, who unfortunately, you know, we had great hopes there.

[01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:48.730]
He left it about five minutes.

[01:57:48.990 --> 01:57:49.970]
It's like everything else, you know.

[01:57:50.570 --> 01:57:52.770]
You think the size come along turns out to be another figure.

[01:57:54.570 --> 01:57:55.770]
Here's a mobile-informed Meyer.

[01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:56.010]
Hello?

[01:57:57.070 --> 01:57:57.750]
Yeah, hi, Neil.

[01:57:57.750 --> 01:57:58.250]
How are you?

[01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.550]
Great.

[01:57:59.230 --> 01:58:02.330]
Hey, I just wanted to call about some great P. Row's situation.

[01:58:02.330 --> 01:58:08.310]
I was telling you that really Jim Gray's objective there was obviously the better his career.

[01:58:08.610 --> 01:58:11.470]
But I just wanted to get your take on the whole thing, your wealth book and gentlemen.

[01:58:12.210 --> 01:58:16.310]
I just can't understand baseball still off the roads of the P. Row's.

[01:58:16.370 --> 01:58:18.990]
You know, they can let a courty-how back in and a Darryl strawberry.

[01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:21.210]
And you know, it was proven for one understand.

[01:58:21.930 --> 01:58:22.390]
Courty-how?

[01:58:22.850 --> 01:58:24.230]
Not courty-how, he's not a player.

[01:58:24.630 --> 01:58:25.330]
He's a FD pal.

[01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:28.590]
But anyway, it was proven also, I believe you can listen directly,

[01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:30.550]
that Steinbrader had ties to the mob.

[01:58:30.890 --> 01:58:32.210]
And you know, they let him back in.

[01:58:32.410 --> 01:58:36.390]
So, I mean, I don't think I'm 28 years old, and I don't think if I let it be 90,

[01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:39.590]
we'll ever see anyone else ever get 4,000 hits in baseball.

[01:58:39.790 --> 01:58:40.390]
Correct, that's absolutely correct.

[01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:45.170]
And I just think it's complete falsy for them to be pointing this out the way they are.

[01:58:45.370 --> 01:58:45.950]
When you get your take on the job.

[01:58:45.950 --> 01:58:47.310]
You can do it a butt sealer like that.

[01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:49.090]
The Commissioner of baseball is a major asshole.

[01:58:49.470 --> 01:58:51.850]
And the Hall of Fame should be for accomplishment on the field,

[01:58:52.050 --> 01:58:54.170]
not for whether the guy was a scumbag or not off the field.

[01:58:54.210 --> 01:58:55.110]
You have nothing to do with it.

[01:58:55.470 --> 01:58:57.510]
Well, just because he's a gambler doesn't make him a scumbag.

[01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:58.910]
I mean, I don't agree.

[01:58:59.110 --> 01:59:01.890]
And I don't see anybody saying because OJ Simpson murdered two people,

[01:59:01.890 --> 01:59:03.470]
they should take him out of the football Hall of Fame.

[01:59:03.650 --> 01:59:05.150]
And what's one thing got to do with the other?

[01:59:05.770 --> 01:59:06.550]
Yeah, this is true.

[01:59:06.970 --> 01:59:07.210]
Exactly.

[01:59:07.970 --> 01:59:08.730]
Okay, thanks, Bill.

[01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:09.470]
Scrooge and Gray.

[01:59:10.470 --> 01:59:11.190]
Have a great day, pal.

[01:59:11.410 --> 01:59:11.870]
You as well.

[01:59:12.570 --> 01:59:14.990]
Yeah, let's put you in gray up there in a goddamn little jet, huh?

[01:59:17.010 --> 01:59:18.190]
Just for a couple of minutes.

[01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:20.370]
5, 6, 7, 8.

[01:59:20.450 --> 01:59:24.410]
So the report from the rinkies that Pavel Brey may play tomorrow night is the game time decision.

[01:59:24.410 --> 01:59:25.910]
The big sparts are Peter Rural.

[01:59:26.030 --> 01:59:27.990]
It looks like probably will play right ahead.

[01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.910]
It can won't play Ray Whitney.

[01:59:28.910 --> 01:59:29.390]
You'll play there.

[01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:30.070]
You're going, I just go on.

[01:59:30.110 --> 01:59:30.250]
Ray.

[01:59:30.970 --> 01:59:31.650]
That's my man.

[01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:34.650]
What are you having for lunch today?

[01:59:34.750 --> 01:59:35.750]
By the way, speaking of Ray Whitney.

[01:59:36.210 --> 01:59:36.970]
What an embarrassment.

[01:59:37.210 --> 01:59:37.770]
What a joke.

[01:59:58.610 --> 02:00:01.270]
I'm not a broad.

[02:00:02.230 --> 02:00:05.130]
A beauty queen.

[02:00:05.130 --> 02:00:08.530]
They all are great.

[02:00:16.890 --> 02:00:20.970]
They won't forget it.

[02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:23.630]
They're dating, I think.

[02:00:23.630 --> 02:00:40.750]
I think they're going to be a couple of days.

[02:00:43.670 --> 02:00:53.610]
I think they're going to be a couple of days.

[02:00:53.610 --> 02:00:53.610]

[02:01:11.790 --> 02:01:23.590]
I think they're going to be a couple of days.

[02:01:23.590 --> 02:01:23.590]

[02:01:23.590 --> 02:01:23.590]

[02:01:23.590 --> 02:01:43.670]
No.

[02:01:47.910 --> 02:02:12.790]
They're going to be a couple of days.

[02:02:12.910 --> 02:02:13.650]
They're going to be a couple of days.

[02:02:13.650 --> 02:02:38.670]
They're going to be a couple of days.

[02:02:38.910 --> 02:02:43.610]
They're going to be a couple of days.

[02:02:43.610 --> 02:02:43.630]
They're going to be a couple of days.

[02:02:45.610 --> 02:02:46.790]
Can you hear that?

[02:02:50.530 --> 02:03:13.590]
They're going to be a couple of days.

[02:03:14.570 --> 02:03:25.270]
I'm going to be a couple of days.

[02:03:26.370 --> 02:03:27.350]
I'm going to be a couple of days.

[02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:43.570]
I'm going to be a couple of days.

[02:03:45.890 --> 02:03:48.750]
I agree with everything people were saying about Pete Rose, etc.

[02:03:52.670 --> 02:03:59.610]
The only thing I don't get is that why Pete kept hanging on to the fact that he said he never met on baseball.

[02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:29.270]
He said he never met on baseball.

[02:04:29.290 --> 02:04:29.590]
He said he never met on baseball.

[02:04:29.590 --> 02:04:29.590]
