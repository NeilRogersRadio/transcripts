[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]
Sports radio 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale presents the best of Neil Rogers.

[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.420]
No live calls will be taken today.

[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.600]
Neil is on tape.

[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.500]
Okay, that's for many years, but it's not.

[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.460]
Really?

[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.080]
Don't call.

[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.100]
The opinions heard on the Neil Rogers show are those of the host and callers

[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.540]
and not necessarily reflective use of easily lead acquisitions

[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.480]
or the piece in broadcast proof.

[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.660]
Its management or anyone else for that matter.

[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.320]
Now remember, this is the best of Neil.

[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.440]
Do not call.

[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.200]
Put the damn phone down.

[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.960]
Just relax and enjoy.

[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.440]
On 560 WQAM.

[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.460]
Okay, so here's the Neil, here's the Neil deal.

[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.680]
Why there won't be a George show today also.

[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.340]
Neil's going to get his neck looked at by a real doctor like someone's been trying to get him to do for weeks now.

[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.280]
And there's no other producer here.

[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.540]
There's no Joe Castello.

[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.420]
So even if I wanted to, I couldn't do the George show, which I was perfectly willing to do.

[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.680]
But it's physically impossible to do it with just one person or I try to pull it off.

[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.660]
But the phones are in the other room.

[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.080]
They can't be brought up in this room in the spots.

[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.560]
Can't be brought up in the other room.

[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.600]
They have to be brought up in this room.

[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.920]
So it takes two people minimum.

[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.480]
And there's no Joe Castello.

[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.720]
The the atlas Joe Castello is not here because he did a late night last night.

[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.720]
At least that's his excuse.

[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.600]
So it's going to be taped mini disc and sorry, that's all there is to it.

[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.460]
I'm going to smoke scars, watch Cory ever sent on ESPN 2 and order from Chuck's later.

[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.880]
Subcenter on 4141 in 199th Street.

[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.960]
Get his plug in right now.

[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.140]
So this ought to make the retarded New York asshole happy who's obsessed with me,

[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.040]
who keeps calling me every day about how much I suck.

[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.480]
This is for you guys and either go back to New York or learn how to say your ours.

[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:53.100]

[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.540]

[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.320]
Oh, what?

[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.960]
Oh, what?

[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.640]
Oh, what?

[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.980]

[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.000]
Oh, what?

[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.000]

[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.980]
Oh, what?

[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.760]
Oh, what?

[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.000]

[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.780]

[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.780]

[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.860]
Oh, what?

[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.860]

[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.460]
Oh, what?

[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.780]
Oh, what?

[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.440]
Oh, what?

[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.300]
Oh, what?

[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.420]
Oh, what?

[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.340]
Oh, what?

[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.220]
He's at the air.

[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.820]
He's advocating marijuana, you know, I'm not.

[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.060]
I'm not advocating anything other than maybe a little bit of freedom, okay?

[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.980]
And maybe getting the government out of your nose and out of your angst tray and doing important things

[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.680]
So that people could walk the street safely and maybe that the food that you eat might be safe for you to eat and things like that little

[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.100]
minor things that they ought to be taking care of instead of doing things that we don't want them to do for us

[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.060]
There let me help you across the street

[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.400]
It's that old deal again. Oh, I don't want to cross the street. Well, I'm gonna drag you over there

[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.760]
Anyway, whether you want to go or not. Thank you

[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.140]
You know when I left here yesterday

[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.400]
I went home and I drove out of the thing and there was a Metro cop who made a U-turn on the side street and then he pulled up right

[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.680]
Alongside me at the light at the red light and I looked at him and he kind of looked at me with kind of a you know

[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.960]
Look like that and I talked to myself. You know something all the things that I talked about here yesterday

[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.020]
Like a marriage we need and about illegal prostitution all these stupid things they got on biscuit and pullover

[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.420]
I've been here for 22 freaking years and it never changed and never will change

[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.280]
Just a waste of your tax dollars going right down the toilet speed traps

[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.920]
Prostitutes and marijuana bus. That's what it's all about. That's police work in America for you

[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.500]
Especially in this town and as I drove away from the a pork around there

[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.740]
I thought to myself since we have so many porkers listening

[00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.100]
Does it really do your heart good to know that you're wasting your time on all these wonderful victim lists?

[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.780]
So-called victimless crimes that you're really protecting us from the murderers and the rapist and the arsonists and making Miami

[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.660]
You're really in this whole area safe place to live. Yeah, it's really safe in it. Let's go downtown

[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.100]
Let's take about a hundred people and just walk around downtown Miami tonight and show that we got the courage to do it

[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.860]
Okay, you first so the emergency we need thing as much you do about nothing and I heard some who the hell was always that

[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.800]
The Booster talk another one of those juvenile sports a holes really juvenile talking about that last night

[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.620]
Oh, yeah, he got caught with the with the awakens we with the marriage we need and talking about it like this was like

[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.560]
I mean grow up already. Well, yeah, all of in his case

[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.220]
He better not smoking starts smoking it because if he eats anymore

[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.940]
He'll blow up like a guy like like Al Goldstein that Booster. Oh, yeah, the wicked weed

[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.840]
I mean, when are you people gonna come out of Lala land like that sin broad that called this morning?

[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.080]
What is it that's so offensive to her in other words women out there?

[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.380]
There's stuff don't stink the women by the way are the ones that are watching jury spring or every day

[00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.380]
There's no man home during those hours the women are the ones that are watching all these crazy talking head shows with all this

[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.780]
Contrified phony bull crap where they're allegedly beating each other up on the stage

[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:11.380]
Which is all staged and all a bunch of crap those are the people that are supporting that garbage the women of America whose minds have turned a

[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.980]
Jello but this show is too outrageous and offensive for them poor babies. Hey, sin

[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.200]
That's fucking bitch have a wonderful day because I know you're listening at any rate

[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.840]
The other big story of course is the Casey Martin ruling which I told you the judge you haven't common sense ruled the right way and said

[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:32.060]
He can play and cut the crap and stop discriminating and Mike Burrino whoever he is writes a very thinly veiled editorial

[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.280]
Not just a commentary but an editorial just and he keeps saying we this and we don't agree what it means

[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.080]
We is the editorial board of the Sun Sentinel since they already wrote a stupid editorial a few days ago

[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:48.640]
Which I read on the year about this cart thing let me say it for the eight million time on you blues nose even Greg

[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.440]
Code text and a Harold's got a good column on it today and if even he can see it all you blue nose assholes

[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.480]
What's the word that Greg Code text uses? He said the there the golfers are too

[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:04.340]
Pursnickety to do it right that's exactly right golfing is not an endurance contest because if it were they'd have to carry their own

[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.540]
Clubs okay walking from one from the one hole to another is not what golf is all about

[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:15.440]
It's a contest of skill is what it's all about. It's boring to begin with okay, but in this day and age for a major

[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.000]
Newspaper like the scum Sentinel to be supporting the scrimination because the guy is handicapped and because these other

[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.380]
Panjis are afraid that he might beat their pants off based on pure golfing skill is really pathetic

[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.920]
So let's make no mistake about it the Sun Sentinel favors discrimination

[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:37.060]
How do you like that because that's all it is plain and simple and now of course the PGA instead of just gracefully accepting the ruling

[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.100]
Which everybody knew was coming now?

[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:45.120]
They're gonna appeal it because all those incredibly meaningful human beings like Jack Nicholas and Arnold Palmer and Ken Venturi

[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.860]
Who's great contribution to the human race has been playing a stupid goddamn game?

[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.120]
They're they're too uptight about even though they're riding their golf carts in the seniors tour that's because they're old far

[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.920]
They're over 50 which makes if that makes them old parts what the hell does that make me?

[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.700]
Ancient exactly and I don't ride no golf car because I don't play a stupid goddamn game called golf

[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:12.300]
But what a what a grotesque thing that a major newspaper alleged like the Sun Sentinel continues hanging out of this

[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:18.360]
Blue nose and mentality. We know what color their nose is blue and brown baby big time. Here's Boka. Hello

[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.820]
Okay, sir, and I couldn't agree with you more on these cops out there

[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:30.400]
I just I don't know where to start I'm 38 years old and you know always been pretty hard work and make good money

[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:36.660]
Payed my taxes paid my bills on time and you know, I've always enjoyed driving a nice car right now. I'm driving a Corvette

[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:45.160]
I think you are too. Yes, I am it's you know these creatins that they allow to be cops that Rome are streets are just amazing to me

[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.420]
They've been allowed to you know criminalize normal behavior

[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.960]
So, hey, and I don't not only that but they like to terrorize the public

[00:08:52.960 --> 00:09:00.100]
I'm driving home yesterday on the 595 going west out toward you know plantation and here's a in FHP and of course the FHP

[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:05.180]
Are the most useless of all or that's just a waste of taxpayers money and this asshole is in the middle lane

[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:11.060]
And then you find that gets over in a right hand lane so that he can terrorize all three lanes and he's going 54 miles an hour

[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:18.420]
Okay, so now naturally everybody around him is in gridlock because that's the whole concept is to slow traffic to a crawl and show them

[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:23.620]
That's a big power trip. Okay, and I thought I would never get the hell home 54 miles an hour

[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:29.200]
And of course I'm like boxed in there like you know a horse race. I'm locked in behind a dead piece and I got nowhere to go

[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.140]
Yeah, let them see that Corvette and you know, they're they're attracted to you like a magnet. Yeah, like a maggot

[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:40.840]
Yeah, exactly, you know, meanwhile the the real bad guys the guys that are doing the real crime you know

[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.060]
The OJ Simpson to the world we can never convict any of those

[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.180]
One of the blue moon see I have this theory that you know

[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:52.840]
Basically what they want to do is they want to harass normal people because they know they have the money to pay the fines

[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.800]
Which generates the funds to keep them in existence?

[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.380]
You know, and if they go after the real bad guys it's gonna cost me let

[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:05.260]
Let me say something really revolutionary here today. Okay, and that is that laws of the when we're talking about police work

[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:13.080]
Waz like speeding laws were made to protect people from danger not to harass people not to give a copper right out of the right or a

[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.940]
Community the right to write business so they can raise revenue

[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:22.360]
And so another word so otherwise if I don't come to a complete stop at a stop sign at 2 30 in the morning when there's no other car for a

[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:28.660]
50 miles around an aid direction the idea that some cops sitting under a tree can write me a traffic ticket for not coming for a running

[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.380]
Or a stop sign or whatever it is is unbelievable

[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.820]
It's just unacceptable and the public in this country are so brainwashed and so

[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:41.020]
Pussified that they just come to accept this like oh, yeah, this is right. You got it will be the law. Yeah, man

[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.920]
Well, I'm like if I'm out in the middle of a highway and I

[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:51.440]
75 on over on a west coast at 2 in the morning and there's nobody around for as far as the eye can see and I'm going to speed limit is like 70 and I'm going 85

[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:57.680]
What the hell difference does it make and isn't it interesting by the way after all the brainwashing about speed kills in his crap

[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:04.480]
How slowly but surely we're getting back to 65 and 70 mile an hour speed limit on the turnpike in parts of 95

[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.800]
And I 75 isn't that interesting and nobody's running around screaming. Oh speed kill

[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.720]
That was the biggest bunch of propaganda and another excuse to write more goddamn business for the porkers

[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.580]
That's what it is. Amen. Hey, I agree with you

[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.780]
Just change the subject. I called them. I guess about a month ago maybe three weeks ago

[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.460]
And I really I predicted this case the Martin thing would I thought he would win

[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.800]
I mean to the right thing to do but he's won so far

[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.460]
But they're gonna appeal it now because you know, they're there are there are there bad you've honor has been challenged here

[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:36.380]
And being the bunch of hardasses that they are they're now willing to accept the ruling of a judge

[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:41.380]
In fact the Sun sent leave an insult our intelligence by saying well, this was a judge in his hometown Eugene, Oregon

[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:46.320]
So you know this favoritism there is if any other judge with a brain anywhere else wouldn't the rule the same thing

[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.400]
Yeah, it's the right thing to do though

[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.240]
Hopefully one time the right thing will win out listen

[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.780]
I've got one other thing to say I have seen boo at the at the arena a few times. Yeah

[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.440]
He is one big unit and he definitely doesn't need to eat

[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.360]
Eat any more than he has to stay alive take care of you have a great day

[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:10.740]
Bell but I do like that orange here see it's called conditioning the public like anything else

[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:16.740]
It's like you know Pavlov and the dog with the bell you can condition people the same way you can do an animal and over a period of

[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.680]
Your lifetime if you're conditioned to the fact that every time you go in 10 miles over the speed limit

[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.180]
You got to keep looking I mean I'm not suggesting you should be able to go any speed you want because you know

[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.560]
You're going 140 miles an hour. It's dangerous unless it's you in the beautiful Corvette

[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:33.320]
You know 230 in the morning on I 75 it should be okay. Let's air that baby out when in doubt

[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.120]
But if you're going to I'll give you a classic example out by me their hiatus road

[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:43.240]
There's a canal on one side there isn't one single house that faces hiatus road

[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:49.420]
Between sunrise and Broward not one there are a couple of churches there set way back off the street

[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.740]
There are a couple of houses on Corners way behind trees and bushes that face side streets

[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.380]
But there isn't there are no little kids

[00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:02.980]
There's nobody nobody lives there and the speed limit is 35 miles an hour and where do you think is one of the favorite spots for

[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.560]
Setting up their speed traps and plantation acres is on

[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:11.920]
Hiatus road between sunrise and Broward Boulevard so they can write business not because anybody is in jeopardy there

[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.840]
Not because somebody's going to get killed or run over but because it's a great place because you know

[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.800]
Nobody in the right mind is going to drive 35 miles an hour that road

[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:25.300]
So please don't insult my intelligence mister porker out there and Mrs. Porker that you're out there to protect me

[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.260]
Because I've been all over the world and I've been in places where it's safe to walk the streets it

[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:34.080]
Too any afternoon and too in the morning and whatever the hell you want and you don't have all these little takes running around with

[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.260]
God damn guns and kids getting shot because daddy left the gun on the table or whatever the reason is this week

[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.460]
Like that five-year-old kid that got killed the other day because you know

[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.700]
Oh, we don't know where the gun came from great. That's good. That's good parental supervision

[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.140]
That's police work in America for you baby

[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:54.340]
And that's why the public has come to accept this slaughterhouse as like this is the way things are supposed to be in the world

[00:13:54.340 --> 00:14:00.360]
Right, whatever you say whatever you say every time you you know used to be many many years ago

[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.180]
You saw a copy like what I'm in Italy

[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:07.940]
I see a cop standing around with an oozion of shoulders standing on a tie over by the Piazza del Aura publica wherever he is

[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:13.360]
And I'm happy to see that because I know he's not gonna hassle me and the fact that he's there is gonna make damn sure

[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.840]
Even a guy damn gypsies won't come around in that neighborhood for a while till he's gone

[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:23.100]
Because these there to make sure that there's a little law and order going on when you see a cop car here

[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.300]
Right away the first thing you think of it. Oh, you look at this pedometer and then you think oh

[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:32.840]
I have my seat belt buckled up and do I have my finger in the wrong place now and is you know all those things

[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:40.500]
Not the cop is my friend anymore, but he's out there to hassle the crap out of me because he's on an ego trip a power god damn trip

[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:47.940]
Hey guys really want to impress your valentine this year make it special by sending her a beer gram from the Vermont Teddy bear company

[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:53.460]
You call in lady North Miami. Hello. Yes, ma'am. Good morning. Neil. How are you?

[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:59.920]
Could be better. I usually talk to you. I'm chronic now, but I'm since I'm a lady. I figured it's okay. Yes, it is

[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.200]
This morning between 738 and headline news

[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:10.540]
Yeah, I son the bottom they have in each state some kind of news in from the acid of Texas they set another

[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.020]
settlement with a church five million dollars on

[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:24.240]
Some kind of abuse sexual abuse, but I don't believe it because there's no fact in the church. It's beautiful. Yes, and I love you

[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:31.460]
Okay, have a great day. How dare you say that you bastard you? Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir

[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.100]
I just off the subject for a minute. What's the subject?

[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.880]
Traffic enforcement. Oh, does George know that when he's talking during the commercial break? Yeah, he does

[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.520]
That's the idea we like that. Oh good. I like hearing about the guy with the yellow here. Mm-hmm. The fact with the yellow here

[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:50.480]
Why I left that out you sounds like an interesting guy by the way. There's no fact in the church. I think he's a priest

[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:57.780]
You realize how contradictory your position is on traffic enforcement. Why is that because if it's an intersection where you get

[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:04.280]
pissed off at the people you're happy they're giving tickets, but if it's something that you're doing then you think it's an invasion of your privacy to get a ticket

[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:12.940]
Oh, so so another words if somebody is creating a when did I ever say that if somebody is driving irresponsibly or not driving according to the law that they shouldn't get a ticket

[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.520]
I'm not saying we just let we just have anarchy on the highway. When did I ever say that?

[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:22.140]
What if you're what? Who decides what the appropriate you think the average asshole on the street because

[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:26.220]
Well, the laws have been created to protect people not the hassle people

[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.700]
They're there to protect people

[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.080]
So if maybe you're driving at two o'clock in the morning and you're weaving a little bit on I

[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:37.400]
75 and you know maybe made a little battle a change, but there's nobody else on the road. What difference does it make?

[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.080]
It's very rarely like Nick. I'm excited for that. What?

[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.520]
That's very rarely someone will get something to break. Give me a break. When's the last time the stop?

[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.460]
I assume I assume that you must be a police person

[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:51.720]
Well, of course you want to know when's the last time you wrote a ticket to an old person for going too slow?

[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.660]
I'll believe me. All people get tickets all the time for going too slow

[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.980]
Too slow. There's not really a statue for going too slow. Yeah

[00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:06.020]
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute on the inner state. There is not a maximum on the inner state there when's the last time you wrote a ticket for an old part going too slow

[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:10.540]
I don't control the inner state. I don't know how I even roll. Well, when's the last time you saw anybody do that?

[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.780]
I can't remember. I've never I've never seen it. I but I see a lot of people

[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.560]
I've never heard of it. I see people driving too slow. Yeah, and how about people?

[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:25.000]
How about people driving in the left hand lane on the inner state or on the turnpike or on any super highway who are going like

[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.340]
Under the speed limit or not going anywhere. That bugs me too. Yeah, but that doesn't mean that it's an invasion of their privacy

[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:37.240]
Just because you're doing something you think is okay. I mean who were you to decide that what you're doing is okay

[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:41.000]
But what they're doing is not well now. What are we talking about now? We're talking about when you're saying that when you speed

[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.860]
You know it's okay because you can decide

[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:50.120]
That is not what I said. It's not related to what I said. It's not even the same side

[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:57.600]
You said that you said that you decide for yourself when you're speeding. I never said anything. You know that it's okay because there's nobody around

[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.740]
I don't think we'll have it. I never said I anything because I don't drive that fast to begin

[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.980]
Oh, you're full of baloney on that. Okay, and number two

[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.820]
What I did say was that if somebody somebody hypothetically is driving

[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.960]
70 miles an hour in a 55 at two o'clock in the morning

[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:17.420]
There's nobody else on the highway for as far as the eye can see that doesn't mirror the speeding ticket because it is not creating any kind of a hazard

[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:22.720]
Anybody else and it's just nitpicking and most cases somebody probably would not be cited. Oh give me a break

[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:28.080]
You're fine. You're not you know as well as I do that if there was a speed trap set up somewhere

[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:33.560]
Those are the kind of people that you guys are looking for why do you think they set up stuff like that besides for making money?

[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.760]
Will you tell me because they want to get people conditioned to the idea to try and stay around the speed limit

[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:44.820]
Oh, give me a break. They want to get people conditioned to the IV thing around the speed limit. If there's nobody around

[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:49.660]
I see people doing the most look look this is Florida. Okay, my friend everybody who can

[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:54.720]
Who can breathe get to drivers license in this state and they they can be over the age of a hundred

[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.600]
And they still get a renewal in the mail automatically for a six-year renewal

[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.300]
We got more people driving irresponsibly. We don't have any kind of a

[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.820]
Inspection system in this state so there's people with no breaks ball tires no headlight

[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:10.000]
I don't ever see those people getting pulled over. I don't see anybody in law enforcement screaming

[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.600]
Inel we need an inspection system in a state to get all the crap off the road here

[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.880]
So it really is safe all you're talking about is writing business and you notice what you can argue with me from now

[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.300]
Till midnight you're never gonna change anybody's mind. All you're doing is writing business

[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.320]
How do you know what people are getting excited for and then when you go down the street and you see a car pulled over

[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.960]
How do you know what they're getting a ticket because when I see somebody sitting there with a radar gun?

[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.280]
I know exactly what they're getting cited for that's just one instance every time you see somebody's with a radar gun

[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:39.140]
Yeah, I never see anyone else getting pulled almost almost never almost never maybe for running a red light

[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.380]
Maybe I've seen that once or twice and if they did that in this time you guys would be busy 24 hours a day

[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.600]
Of course, but maybe the guy who ran the red light said it was okay

[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.500]
I think this is safe. That's okay. I'm gonna go ahead and go for it because I know I'm a good driver

[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.720]
When did I ever say that?

[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:57.400]
Hypothetically of course. Oh, I see hypothetically. No, nobody ever said that that it's okay to run a red light

[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:02.440]
It's okay to speed up hypothetically. Yes, and to run to go through a stop sign when I mean complete stop

[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:09.120]
Yeah, I go ahead and I know nobody's coming. No, not if you decide if there's if it's if it's all I can take a so many intersections right now

[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.240]
At the top of my head where you can see a very clearly in all directions

[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.260]
I'm thinking like I'm about 21st the

[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.200]
21st Avenue 100 or 121st Street and 118th Avenue by me

[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.220]
There's a stop sign there and they got a new deal now there and no I did not get a ticket by the way

[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:27.020]
So it's not so our grapes and they're sitting around in a see if people made a full stop at that stop sign now

[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:31.100]
You have full vision and all directions to see if anybody is coming or anything is in a row

[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.640]
And I mean to nitpick and make sure that all four wheels came to a complete stop

[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.120]
Or I'm gonna write you a ticket that's brow beating the public and you know it as well as I do

[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.920]
You know, I'll tell you one thing every time there's been an accident the first thing they always tell me is I never saw the other car

[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.880]
Okay, so one day you're gonna go through that stop sign and when you get smashed you're gonna say hey

[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.080]
I looked but I never saw the other car when I say I go through that when the hype that said it

[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.520]
No, I'm not talking about hypothetical. I'm talking about lots of people who do that

[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.640]
Yeah, and that's the first thing they always say is I never saw the other car coming

[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.680]
But they know for sure that is clear, but they never saw the other car coming

[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.220]
Uh-huh

[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.920]
So that's what happens when you just assume that you know better than the law let me say it again

[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.260]
Oh, that you know better than the law. Here's our lecture now. We're getting a lecture folks

[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.580]
We know better than the law so if you got titted windows and you're smoking a number in the car

[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:18.720]
You better not know better than the law because this guy's gonna put you over and put you in a hoose call because you got we

[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.520]
Nah, there you go because you know better than the law

[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.660]
You know you've never been the same since you got arrested. Yeah, right

[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:30.200]
On your shoulder I've been talking the same about police first of you want to talk about it crap

[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.840]
That's another that's another subject

[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:36.800]
Never been bad before never this bad is what no before you used to complain about getting speeding tickets

[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.200]
But ever since you got arrested you've just been down down down on the law. Yeah, right

[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.900]
I've been down on the law all of my adult life sir because I'm tired of people getting hassled for bull crap

[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:49.380]
That's the end of the conversation unbelievable. I've never been the same another piece of

[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:54.280]
Obfuscation sir you don't want to deal with the facts and that is you're not in a law enforcement business

[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.840]
You're in the harassment business

[00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:00.860]
You're in the goddamn harassment business and always have been and what the hell does this have to do with that?

[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.580]
What does one have to do with the other but that's always a convenient excuse?

[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.180]
There's anybody who doesn't believe in letting the cops do whatever they want to you

[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:11.980]
They've got some excuse and can't possibly be a legitimate point of view you asshole you

[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.960]
Unbelievable. That's right when you you can come to that stop sign

[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.940]
You can see is clearly you can look and look and look as you go through there

[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:24.760]
And if you don't come to see that's the law that all four wheels must come to a complete stop otherwise you're breaking a law

[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.600]
Now that's a good law isn't it? Well change the laws screw change in the laws

[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:33.260]
Okay, we don't have time to try to change the laws with a bunch of our keg bull crap going on in this country

[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.840]
With the presidents up there getting blow jobs every day in the White House

[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:41.400]
We don't have time to worry about changing that law either the fact is go save some lives and do some real serious law enforcement

[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.000]
Stop trying to justify we want to condition the people to go in the speed limit

[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.800]
What a joke that is and what they've done in this town because of the paranoia instead of like real cities

[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:56.740]
Major markets like Chicago and Detroit and like we're in LA where when the highways aren't jammed packed like in the middle of the day

[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:57.920]
And people are going you know

[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:04.940]
75 and a 55 and everybody and the cops are going by it like you're standing still because they create what is called a traffic flow

[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:11.180]
That's why there is no flow of traffic here because you got some people going 90 some people going 30 some guy in his little

[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.460]
Brown Toyota going 25 in the middle lane or in the left hand lane

[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.120]
There is no traffic flow

[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:22.780]
Because everybody out here does this sit their own thing and I don't ever ever see any of those people being pulled over by the way

[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:27.940]
The ones that are going like crawling around causing other people to make to make hazardous decisions that cause accidents

[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:33.960]
It's these old parts and these banana boat people with their unsafe cars that are going 25 miles an hour in the middle of the interstate

[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.360]
Forcing other people that take drastic action getting frustrated

[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:43.500]
They're the ones who caused the accidents in fact most of the time they didn't even wind up being in the accident because they're a half a mile behind it

[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:48.540]
By the time it happens but give me a big lecture in a song in a dance about how dear you think that you're gonna

[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:55.420]
You know flunk the law right flunk this we're paying his goddamn salary and he's given me a lecture on what my attitude ought to be

[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:59.900]
How do you like that? That's the best part you're paying a salary and if he wants to stand there in the middle of the road

[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:05.160]
But this goddamn radar gun and hassle your life and it caused a lot of stress to by the way which every time you see a pig

[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.100]
Oh, yeah, we want to condition you that's right

[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.140]
You want to condition the public all right to mistrust you is what you want to do

[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:15.240]
But blame it on me because I'm a bad guy with a chip on my shoulder right. Yeah, you're John. That's right

[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.820]
I don't get arrested with my excuse

[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:21.820]
Well, you're not Chinese and see when somebody will call up and will with that kind of a militant attitude

[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:26.980]
Who's going out of his way to twist what I'm saying to try to try to make me look like some kind of an outlaw

[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:32.640]
See because I don't want to be the obedient, beautiful citizen who thinks that everybody should do according to the letter of the law

[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.200]
The goddamn presidents up there getting blow jobs from 21-year-old girls

[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:41.840]
Which most of us don't give a crap about that to his business, but for crying out loud worst supposed all worry about the letter of the law

[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.640]
This is probably the same kind of guy who would tell you that if they come to your window tonight

[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:50.260]
They're looking in the window to make sure you're doing it in the missionary position with your wife or husband or both as the case

[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.180]
May be otherwise you're gonna take you off to the goddamn gas chamber

[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:57.140]
That's the kind of mentality this guy's got hey who are you to know better than the law exactly?

[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:03.160]
That's right keep it out of there. Yes, sir error fat if you want a big big fat mattress to stick all your money under

[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:07.360]
That's a good idea. I think you'll says stick it under the mattress and the money too

[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:12.860]
And if you want to get a great name brand mattress the only intelligent way to buy it is to pick up the phone sit right where you are

[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.860]
Don't make a move except to reach for the phone and call dial a mattress. I did it two years ago

[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.460]
I've been happy every night since because

[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:26.160]
Salivates over the seabed video cops too hot for TV

[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:26.780]
Hmm

[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.940]
I love them and you

[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:36.700]
Now you'll mess your pants with cops the bluepers edition you have the right to remain

[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.120]
Like Silas but definitely there

[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.940]
That's right the plenty is foul up

[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:48.900]
Through it and blunders are all captured up plus tab two hour home

[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:49.200]
Bitty

[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:54.060]
All the

[00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:01.880]
Rusting that got cut out of the original TV show hey, sir. You sure you want to take a ride with it

[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:03.420]
Yeah

[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:14.720]
Bluepers edition order today here's the coconut grove hello hey about a lack of police

[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:20.640]
Duty here. I got mugged down here in the grove few months ago. I'm sorry to believe oh, yeah

[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:26.180]
Right up to the guys review about two weeks after I got out of basketball or for a cataract replacement

[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:32.980]
Right didn't have much peripheral vision. Yeah, up to the guys review mirror on the outside that's your door and

[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:38.720]
Two guys got out beat my ass really literally in front of like five or six people

[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.560]
I had to go into into the store to call 911 myself. Yeah

[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:49.580]
The cops show up and they don't even want to go after this guy. Oh, you know the guys name. I don't know the guys name

[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.440]
I just got mug they sat around with their thumbs up there

[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.520]
rectum rectum and

[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:59.620]
Yeah, just ask me a bunch of questions. This has been what four or five months now

[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.460]
No, wait a minute. Why are you say you had to go into 7-Eleven to make the call?

[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:08.500]
In the food spot in the food spot. Well, maybe they were refreshing. They were making you coffee in there while you know

[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.700]
You were wearing a sock. He just brought in a fresh batch. It's not yeah

[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.120]
But you know

[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:21.660]
Meanwhile the next day I had surgery to replace the the retina on the backside of my eye

[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:26.180]
Yeah, I'm at blind out of it and under the state attorney's office

[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:33.140]
That up to the detective department at very illustrious police department downtown. They've done nothing

[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:38.260]
Uh-huh. You guys are jerks. Well, they're too busy counting up traffic tickets. Exactly. Have a great day pal

[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.720]
Good luck to you. You'll need it just like that Johnny Versace business baby

[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.740]
Of course on the beach and of course they have changed the law now over there

[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:49.340]
They changed the way the system in the pawn shop said I'm gonna bring Johnny Versace back when Andrew

[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:54.120]
Canana was running around out there in the white open and signing his name and showing his passport and all the other craft

[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.920]
There's some more good police work for they did a beautiful job on that

[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.340]
But then again, he was only a murderer

[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.440]
He was only a serial killer or a spree killer or whatever the hell it is

[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:05.160]
The all depending on which shrink you listen to he was just running around a country killing people

[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.300]
And so even though somebody's dead of course he was you know both only fags

[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.800]
So that's not all important anyway, I guess but there you go

[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.300]
I mean we don't we go want to catch up on that because we don't have it computerized

[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:18.880]
Well, they do now they do now because the focus of the the light of the universe was on them

[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:24.540]
And what an embarrassing bunch of crap that was it sat around for days and days on somebody's desk until they could review it

[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.540]
And take a look at it and the pawn shop slipped to yeah

[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.580]
Go scare those old parts and get them off the road for Christ. They let them turn in their drivers licenses

[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:37.540]
I don't want to mention that my mother's got friends who are like 125 years old like it six year renewals automatically in the mail

[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:41.200]
People that can't hear people that can't see people are like God in Fassima

[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.960]
People that can't get their head up to the bottom of the steering wheel

[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.660]
But they're giving them six year renewals and their drivers license

[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:51.020]
You'll never ever ever ever see those people pulled over off the road

[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.520]
Never gonna happen man

[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.320]
Not in your lifetime or mine

[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.560]
Which state probably those people are the ones who will curtail our lifetimes

[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.600]
And wind up killing us out there and they got them highway

[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.660]
You just better you better be more obedient mister

[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.860]
This guy he was he was the best thank you so much by the way sir

[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.240]
Thank you for being the inspiration for my life

[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.840]
And of course it's only near Rogers that makes those comments

[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.120]
Because near Rogers once got arrested for some silly thing that they threw out

[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:14.820]
But nevertheless

[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.740]
Near Rogers have got a grudge nobody else makes jokes about cops to make a into coffee and eat and don't

[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.220]
If that's something near Rogers invented

[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:21.880]
Right

[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.540]
Right just keep trying to you know

[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:28.980]
Shift the argument just keep trying to like out the skate and cover up your tracks or officer

[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:33.360]
Your full of crap and everybody knows it everybody knows it and let me say it again

[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.820]
Go to any civilized country which of course leads out most of this hemisphere except maybe Canada

[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:42.260]
Go to any civilized country and walk around on the streets and see what kind of environment you got

[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:46.360]
And while we'll look at the driving go to Toronto and see what a real city is all about

[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:51.160]
Find out what life is all about as opposed to this goddamn police state

[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.780]
Where every time you fart they're gonna drag your ass in because they got because we

[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.340]
Then of course into the more farters we got and the more its pots moakers we got

[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:03.420]
Then of course we can throw those people in the jail cells and let the murderers in the arsonist and the axe murderers out

[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:09.040]
Because the jails are overcrowded for babies and they're not getting tree square meals a day. Here's a kindle. Hello

[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.900]
How are you okay sir? I got a story for you

[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.840]
And I think you actually I think you're gonna love this. I'm driving down Sheridan street

[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.240]
This is a few years back and they have the police out there and they're little

[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.100]
You know tacked for us getting ready to take it everybody. Yeah, I got the guns on them

[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:27.240]
So it pulls me over. It says you're going 40 in a school zone and I said to the guy I don't see a school zone sign

[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.340]
He goes well, I can't help but if you didn't see it you're going 40 in a school zone. So I'm thinking well

[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:38.820]
Maybe I did miss it. It gives me the ticket. I drive up a block and a half and there's the school about two-thirds under construction. Yeah

[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:46.820]
Oh, I love it. Isn't that great? Yeah, but someday there's gonna be little kids running around there sir

[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:51.040]
He look this goes right back to what the cops said he wants to condition you

[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.520]
Oh into driving slowly because in a few months maybe two years there's gonna be a real schooler

[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.700]
That's right. So I was trying to do you a favor and get you conditioned to obeying the law right

[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:04.720]
So I say to myself well, obviously I'm gonna go to court on this. Yeah, so I get my court date and it's you know

[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.200]
six seven weeks and you know away from that

[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.940]
I got a court in the courtroom full of people you know and you're figuring this is gonna take me two-thirds of the day

[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:17.040]
But I'm gonna sit here and I'm gonna tell the judge this story and I'm watching people go up there and they're telling the judge

[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:25.220]
And it turns out that almost the whole the whole courtroom were people from that day at that spot and the judge here's five or six people

[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:30.140]
Seven people and he finally says who else is here for this almost the whole courtroom raises their hand

[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:34.080]
They did a hell of a job. Yeah, so the judge says oh well

[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:40.160]
He says well, I'm gonna charge everybody 32 50 and court costs and dismiss everything and I hear people going

[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.140]
Oh, that's great. They all getting up ready to go out and pay the clerk

[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:49.380]
I raised my hand. I said you're on her you're asking me to pay $32 and 50 cents for something I didn't do and he gets this

[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:55.440]
Look on his face like how dare you challenge me. Yeah, and he says that's exactly what I'm telling you to do

[00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:02.460]
I say I'd like a jury trial. I didn't I just a shot in the dark and then a guy weighing the taxes. Hey, yeah me too

[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:09.200]
trouble maker and another guy over and says yeah, how we're gonna pay $32 and 50 cents

[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:14.620]
We're all here for the same thing. Obviously these police screwed up the judge slams his gabbled down on the desk

[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:20.700]
This is everybody for here for this get out of my courtroom and so we want it all right beauty nice job pal

[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.040]
Hey take care of it. Don't do it again. All right. Okay. How do you like that?

[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.940]
We're gonna give him a discount man like oh, yeah, we only had to pay $32

[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:32.160]
50 and then to leave it up to this guy to have the balls which most people don't let me say it again next time

[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.420]
You get a ticket call a ticket defense team. Okay, that's what I do

[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:40.480]
I think I've had maybe two tickets in last six or seven years both with radar of course of course

[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:46.140]
And both and yes, I have been pulled over two or three times for a speeding a related night in plantation

[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.780]
And they always say have a nice day and they don't do it again

[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:52.720]
So it's not a personal grudge the plantation cops have always been very nice to me

[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:57.540]
But it just generally speaking this whole this whole concept of

[00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.660]
Hasling the public is I mean, you know

[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:03.080]
Maybe if we could afford the luxury of doing it if it was like a sideline if we had no other crime

[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.700]
And we figured well, you know might as well do something like that other guy said because they're bored

[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.600]
Maybe then you could understand it

[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.280]
But where you have vandalism on every goddamn street corner

[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.560]
You got punks running loose on the streets where you got people

[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:18.240]
Immorteming people on street corners where you got people of being held up in shopping mall parking lots

[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.720]
Where you have people shooting each other over parking spaces and you look around

[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:25.340]
Is there a cop anywhere? Oh no, he's busy on hiatus there with a radar gun

[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:30.660]
Let's go ahead and you'll have a nice day and guess what you can if there's any cops out there that think that because I do

[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:35.280]
They would java do this on a year for years because I say these things you're gonna write me a ticket go right ahead

[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:35.860]
Be my guest

[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:42.400]
I haven't paid a traffic ticket in this day now. I don't think any kind of a ticket in this for a year's maybe a 15 20 years

[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:47.680]
Because I call it ticket defense team. They get it thrown out because more often than out it's bogus and good luck

[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.520]
But if it'll make you feel better

[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:54.640]
Maybe that poor girl be sitting out here when I leave again today. We're over there. Yeah. Here's a mobile in for a lottery. Hello

[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.460]
Yeah, I know yes, sir. Yeah, I got two quick cops for you

[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.700]
Um, stop to pick them yourself and wake work

[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:02.860]
About 10

[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.200]
Like I can run it up to the clock trying to sell me crack

[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.940]
Right, so I finally get away. That's not guys that were a German Italians

[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:14.540]
Yeah, and I finally get away from them and I get pulled over for obstructing traffic

[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.400]
Yeah, and I tell the cops I say them guys were

[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.300]
standing in front of my car on the side of my car trying to somebody drunken

[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.060]
He says we're not dealing with crack today. We're dealing with traffic

[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.780]
And then the second story

[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:34.280]
This was not a crack day, sir. It was a traffic day better get you better get your days in the week right

[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:40.160]
It's like today was craft macaroni and cheese day tomorrow be craft day uh crack day right and then uh

[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.740]
Somebody will be don't update. Yes

[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:47.600]
The second one I'm driving on 95 doing 75 miles an hour. Yeah, I get pulled over

[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:52.520]
Another club that gets pulled over right next to me doing 110 miles an hour

[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:58.740]
He gets out of the car. He shows his badge. They shake hands. He gets back in his car and drives away

[00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.300]
I

[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:06.700]
Said how do you let him go away driving 110 to come to me? You say one more way. I'm gonna put your ass in jail

[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.860]
There you go. I have been mild. Yes, sir

[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:14.240]
Yeah, that's the way it goes out there. I want to condition you to being a good obedient to a junior flagger

[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.600]
That's it pal. That's right. All right. Thank you Neil. Don't do it again

[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:20.180]
Okay, I guess I better not tell him I was the one in the event

[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.440]
Twq. I am you know there lots of long distance services out there god

[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.760]
And they got eight million of them being advertised all over one 800 this one 800 that 1010 this

[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:32.340]
And they're just so many of them it's confusing many of them by the way are owned by the same big companies

[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.780]
They charge long distance services to your phone bill that's so cute and armoured a leg

The problem is all inside up that she said to me

[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:45.060]
But the answer is easy if you practice or relieve

[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:53.420]
You must enhance your four-player currently will leave and must be 50 ways to reach your lover

[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.560]
50 ways to reach your lover

[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:05.400]
Lie flat on the back jack go down to a clam saying use the vibrating toy

[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.220]
Just listen

[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:09.840]
Like the alphabet

[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:23.000]
I said I treat that act with the utmost disdain

[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:29.660]
To go south with the mouth. I'm sorry. I'm afraid for the few insist

[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.620]
Then would you please explain

[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:36.240]
About the if you waste a bit your lover

[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:43.540]
If you waste a bit your lover just keep on the trip

[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.980]
Fucker up on a beast

[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.640]
He's piece of that pie guy

[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.940]
Now listen to me

[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:55.840]
Die on the muffler just give it enough time

[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.880]
She more can't be the key

[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.180]
She says so many

[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:07.380]
Just discussing the really important segment on 60 minutes last night before mayor swarrow's made a jackass out of himself

[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:13.080]
Which we're used to and that's the segment about Vernon Jordan who be the good friend of the president and very interestingly

[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:18.800]
You hear about the bleep that we have to use on different things because they get real uptight on the certain shows on the station

[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.540]
Because they're much immature pussies

[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.240]
But at any rate so last night

[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:27.300]
Michael Mike Wallace was talking to different people about Vernon Jordan and refused to be interviewed for this piece

[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.820]
So to speak and at any rate that they were they were quoting

[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:35.280]
Vernon Jordan is when they asked him about what are you the you and the president talk about when you're out there

[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:41.880]
Golfing you know when you're riding around on the cart like Casey what's his name and Mike Wallace said the word and they bleep

[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.580]
I mean they put in a bleep it was like

[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:51.220]
Right there you go. I don't have one of those mine's not that long. I have a short one

[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:55.840]
But anyway the word that they were trying to say was see is the word how do you like that

[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.680]
That's what Vernon Jordan the president talk about when they get together because they're both big woman eyes

[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.780]
They both screw around a lot they talk about see is what it is they said that were three different times on here

[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:09.140]
And the bleep kept kept getting longer and longer almost as long as the president knows

[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:10.920]
It was incredible

[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:16.240]
If you ever have you know set lately now that you've seen he's got that big red one sticking out and his nose is getting long too

[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:22.480]
I'm going to get to my thing about the dominoes pizza delivery before and you know something this was the most important story of the whole last week

[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.200]
The most important story about for us

[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.600]
This was not about the president getting this thing

[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.640]
Stock parade this was not about the dropping bombs on

[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.640]
Hussein who's running around from a house to house like oh and then of course last night

[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:41.620]
We had our big 60 minutes thing with mayor Suarez as we get embarrassed one more time from coast to coast and pillar to post

[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:46.220]
Here's a man who is absolutely belongs in a rubber room somewhere in a straight jacket

[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:52.760]
And he's the mayor of this town and leave it to Steve Croft and the people on 60 minutes to finally expose the sham and his garbage

[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.480]
And nobody here cares

[00:39:54.480 --> 00:40:00.540]
Because like the one guy on there said the average voter in the city of mind is a 63 year old Cuban woman with no teeth and no

[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.600]
Spigot English and those are the only people who vote in the city of Miami

[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.480]
And that's why we got the and he also made a comment. This is a third world banana

[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:13.620]
Haven't seen that for years. Yes, I have. Thank you sir some bearded professor from F.I.U

[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.440]
That was great. That was a great piece

[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:19.580]
In the Steve Croft says you've gotten as bad as it possibly can can get any worse

[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:22.580]
And he said no, he said are you sure he said no it'll get worse

[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:26.660]
I mean we've only got people that are that this is worse than Dick daily and any other dick

[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:30.160]
You can think of we got dead people voting we got millions of all these a bad ballots

[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.820]
And nobody is a get Jan the Carl Hyerson they actually made seem a little humorous last night on 60 minutes

[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:39.440]
And that's quite an accomplishment because he's almost as funny as Dave Barry like that

[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.160]
Big story of the week about the Domino's pizza delivery didn't want to deliver in a certain part of town

[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:48.320]
Because it was dangerous and right off the bat. Oh, well, that's an ethnic thing. Maybe it's uh. Yeah

[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.920]
It's bigotry and the court ruled that they got to deliver there

[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.820]
Even though we have we find out in this story which we saw in the TV on a local news

[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:55.880]
We have places uh

[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:01.080]
Pizza delivery people in Miami who won't deliver to certain parts of like Liberty City or over time because it's too dangerous

[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:05.140]
But the court says you got to deliver there if you deliver some place else you got to take your life in your hands

[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:10.320]
How do you like that a lot of times these muggers are the ones calling the pizza guy right ordering out for money

[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.040]
Right and then waiting for him

[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:17.500]
But how about those kids that time man? Was it New Jersey or somewhere that just killed the pizza delivery guy just for something to do

[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:21.000]
I mean don't do that unless the pizza is cold and really bad for Christ's kids

[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.420]
So what are we gonna do about these pizza people?

[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:25.740]
They don't want to deliver in certain areas. I say we give them a medal

[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:31.980]
The idea that the court is gonna tell me if I work in bomb a delivery guy for some pizza joint or any other kind of a joint

[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:35.820]
That I have to go into a neighborhood with that so dangerous that my life is in jeopardy

[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.480]
I'll you know, why would do I tell the judge you go delivered here you go

[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:44.920]
Here's a pepperoni with extra cheese you go delivered asshole and see how fast he puts his stupid ass in jeopardy over there

[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.280]
Even art Fleming and Alex Trebek wouldn't go in that joint

[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:53.120]
I think it was nasol which is supposed to be near like Riviera Beach or singer-rounder will find out from the audience

[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:56.220]
I never heard of such a joint here's a lady. I know nasol in the Bahamas

[00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:00.940]
I know how dangerous that is and believe me. I'm not delivering no pizzas there lady in Miami. Hello

[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:07.240]
Now they're gonna have to pay combat pay it dominos. Uh-huh at the way it's going. How do you like that? I don't at all

[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.980]
I don't like that at all it's ridiculous

[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.080]
I think that's another reason to get mama marries

[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:19.640]
Yeah, so you don't put anybody in jeopardy. Mm-hmm. I was calling to see if you you if you'd seen that 60 minutes piece

[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:27.640]
Yes, I did I just I can't I'm listening to slyas sit there and deny things that are so obvious like oh no

[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:30.020]
There's nobody in in my administration who's up

[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.060]
Legal charges. Oh, what about this nobody?

[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:38.780]
The first reason is it was not three commissioners two of my or metro commission no lonely one of ours and the city manager

[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:44.780]
And this one and that one and all his other cronies that he just stuck in there and the thing about the money laundering about oh

[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.860]
Well, you make it sound like it's for drugs. Oh, well, it's not for drugs. It's for the president

[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.800]
You have a don't make it sound like it's for drugs. That's what that would be awful

[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.480]
Oh, this is this is just unbelievable if they don't

[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.880]
Get this guy out of there. If they don't recall him or have another election

[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:02.120]
Then there there ought to be like a massive protest like 24 hours a day in the city of Miami

[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.400]
Nothing else. We're just embarrassing a sense of the entire country

[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.900]
That's right and of course the whole area has to suffer. I mean all of us who live here

[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.500]
We know that the city itself is nothing but a stupid banana republic

[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:16.840]
But the fact that all of South Florida has to you know suffer our image which is bad enough already as a slaughterhouse because mayor

[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.840]
Suarez is doing bad drug or something. I mean to hell with it

[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.540]
And then of course then I love what he says to see croffle

[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:25.700]
They played the tape of his threatening message to the hero remember that right

[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:30.560]
He threatened to pull all the cities ads out of the hero and they said oh well, you know, it was a it wasn't good

[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.060]
But you could tell from the tone. I was just joking

[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:37.000]
Right I need to see it when I need to hear when he's serious. Yeah

[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:41.620]
Serious he's a serious asshole. Oh always was the other thing I overdid

[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.380]
You and George talking about curling

[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:49.280]
Your teeth on sending morning on cds about the history of it and how it works

[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.600]
I was watching it turns out the whole thing was embedded in Scotland

[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.040]
Tigger farmers

[00:43:54.040 --> 00:44:00.760]
were in kills probably when when all they had was frozen lakes and and granite stones and nothing else to do

[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:05.380]
So it figured that's what that's what a whole game came you know something you watched this whole thing

[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:12.280]
I started to mention before not only is are the events themselves of far is very few of these events are really sports in this winter Olympics

[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:18.000]
But then for the silly ones like the the what do they even call it ice dancing and

[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.360]
It's dancing at place dancing and figure skating and then constantly especially on a cbc talking about how the judges are like

[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.040]
banding together in groups the Eastern Europeans and the French

[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:34.560]
And the whole thing is fixed that the joke they do place it favorites they always have especially back when there was the Soviet block it

[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:34.840]
Right

[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:41.180]
It was notorious while they're all doing it the Eastern European judges and the French and of course leave it to the French because there are a bunch of traders

[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:45.660]
Anywhere they're scum to leave it to them. They're the ones that are always you know harboring terrorists and selling

[00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:49.220]
nuclear weapons to a 10th world countries. That's the French for you

[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:53.700]
Always and then they'll do it that so somebody faxed this the article. Thank you so much from the Harold

[00:44:53.700 --> 00:45:00.580]
About king and his subjects and the people of this town have been yuck clamoring for years for that money that Larry owes to them for years

[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:02.440]
They wanted back. I will not give it to you

[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:09.140]
millions and millions and millions that this man has made and refused to pay people like the thousands that he built them out of I will not give it to you

[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.740]
Larry will make good on his old South Florida debt

[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:12.280]
He owed now

[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:17.160]
This is the best part of this story is which whoever faxed it didn't realize and could never have known unless they're psychic like they should go

[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.120]
Griffin he owed five thousand dollars to see more

[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.120]
Notarius every tear in New York veterinarian

[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:27.560]
Seymour notarius are coming to find out this is the guy who used to pedal his

[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.180]
Rice and lamb at a dog food in my health food store in 1977

[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:36.040]
Over in whatever that part of town is in North aid in North Miami Beach

[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:40.020]
Oh my god, and it comes to find out later in the story who died in July of 81

[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:44.520]
Well, he was a big fat guy and people were coming to my health food store and he'd sit there next to the counter

[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.920]
You gotta go hug that was Seymour

[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:50.760]
Well anyway, he used to belly a colophine at Larry owed him five grand. I will activate it

[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:57.320]
And now the whole thing is the they've resorted they've added up the interest on this thing as a result of pay off figure is supposed to be

[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.440]
29,000 to 119 bucks because the loan was made

[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:08.540]
in 1978 and will repay the principal says Larry's lawyer agent whoever this is but we're not gonna entertain the interest or the public

[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:10.800]
I will activate and the notarius died

[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:15.380]
But the daughter and law the daughter is gonna get the money. She's an inkeeper in Crote non-Hudson New York

[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:21.180]
Says he died broke. How do you like that at age 67 is poor bastard died broke and Larry owed him the money

[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.620]
They might have kept him going for another year or two. I doubt it

[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:28.500]
Not a lot of money. She says it's the principal. I remember daddy feeling tremendously betrayed by Larry King

[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:35.280]
King will not pay seven thousand dollars to widow Marge Hartnett who says relate husband former cruel Gebel's mayor Fred Hartnett

[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:41.020]
Senior loaned him the cash in the 1960s and got stiff. I will activate King simply doesn't remember says bear on desk

[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:45.580]
Who's his lawyer or whatever but he rep? He resents the implication that he's cheap and won't pay his debt

[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:50.500]
So the king of talk is offering to donate ten thousand dollars to Miami children's hospital in the heart and its name

[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:54.960]
Says Hartnett. I love children's hospital. Be the money to us. I will activate. So there you go

[00:46:54.960 --> 00:47:00.860]
I've gone Larry you cheap prick you phony baloney ask kisser all these years have gone by even that guy

[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:05.280]
Even at nice veteran. He was a good guy real fat though. He's dead the fat people are the dead people

[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:10.520]
You know how that goes? Here's a mobile in Miami shores. Hello. Hey. How you doing? Okay. I wanted to

[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:14.500]
You know you were talking about the 60 minutes and I thought I watched that last night and

[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:20.240]
I had some pretty good laughs, you know like the line where you don't know how that was a post to vote Miami and all the other stuff

[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.400]
Once again, you know, it's like it's like we're embarrassed

[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:29.420]
You know like you said nationwide was like that time magazine cover a few years ago and now we have this ridiculous

[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:31.620]
Crap going on in the city

[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:38.100]
And then you know people expect crime to come under control when our leaders are pulling this kind of hijack

[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:41.580]
I mean, you know, I'm gonna tell you something that really pisses me off about that

[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:46.760]
And that is Carl Hyerson from the Harold who they made look like a real little comedian there last night like Dave very junior

[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.620]
He's sitting there making his little wise cracks and he writes his stupid little columns

[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:54.580]
They're Harold to me are just as corrupt as any politician in the city of Miami

[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.560]
They were behind the metro rail and putting that over on the public

[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:01.740]
And then they slapped this in the face and told it was a white it was a white elephant which it is

[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:07.400]
Then they got behind Mickey Harrison in this this cock-a-mame deal for this new arena that is gonna be built for their own

[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:13.000]
Profit and their own benefits so that they can boost up the value of one Harold plaz it under by the by the waterfront

[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.020]
I mean the heralders corrupt as the day is long their full of crap and he's under making all these costic little comments

[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:20.320]
If the herald is so goddamn great and so

[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.200]
Upright, how come they're not doing something about all of this that's going on

[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:29.840]
How come we don't see like massive rebellion in date county while we're waiting for the local media to provide some leadership on it

[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:34.740]
That's a good point. I don't think I think I don't know what they're hired. Everything is a big joke to them

[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:36.180]
Let me ask you a question

[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:41.560]
One thing I don't understand when when swear as was mayor the last time he seemed like a fairly reasonable guy

[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:44.500]
He's lost it man. He must have got some bad weed or something

[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:50.020]
Well got the he had totally lost that he's flipped out it might it's to me either two things number one

[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:55.660]
He's bipolar and he's not on the right amount of medication. He's bisexual. Yeah, or whatever or number two

[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.420]
He's been doing something

[00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:02.560]
Joe Gerson if he wants it. He's got a bias exactly. I mean, there's just no other reason for it. Yeah

[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:08.400]
Well nobody cares man nobody cares about live and brow it screw them. That's true too. Okay, pal say out of Miami

[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.740]
When you're free to you five six feet

[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:11.420]
Q a

[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:11.800]
F

[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:18.580]
The Neil Roger show now on five six feet WQ AM Miami Fort Lauderdale

[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.700]
In chains just the way I like him and then this morning

[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:25.300]
I'm coming to work and I'm over there in plantation which by the way I'll get to plantation

[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:29.520]
I would like to report right now that I believe that there's a trigger in a wood piling sin plantation

[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.980]
And the call we had from the cop last week on his show

[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:37.920]
And now we have this plantation uh this big thing this is step campaign starting today by the way

[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:43.220]
Which I'll get into these selective enforcement to a traffic enforcement program step as in step on this

[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:48.480]
That call was from some porker over there in plantation is what it was all about because this article in yesterday's paper

[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.700]
Which I appreciate somebody bringing to my attention by the way

[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:53.880]
This is a carbon copy of that phone call we got last week

[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.040]
They're trying to condition us to doing this and do it a meantime

[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:01.260]
I'll come back from the track last night and come west on sunrise boulevard off the turn bike as always

[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:04.860]
And there are people I'm going it's 45 is the speed limit okay

[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:12.200]
I'm going 50 52 whatever which a little bit over people are going by me as always 70 75 miles an hour on sunrise boulevard

[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:19.440]
And I say you people need mental help including you you're telling me that you were one of those people go in 70 miles an hour on sunrise last night

[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:23.760]
Well 65 70. I don't usually do 17 until I get on you know poem mental help

[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:24.860]
I just can't believe okay

[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:27.240]
There's nobody else on the road and that yeah, okay, I don't run any

[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.380]
I wonder when that the guy's talking about that wants to make it up as you go along

[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:34.860]
There's nobody else on the road. You're going to go 70 on a residential street. That's nice

[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:40.020]
We know that foreriner just gets away from you. Yeah, I know it's your time. I'm lucky. I only drive it in Corvette

[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:43.880]
That can only go 155 miles an hour. You got that big powerful foreriner

[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:47.800]
I mean, I can't compare with that a lot of rumors about this station by the way we'll get into that

[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:51.040]
So anyway getting back to this thing well first of all there's only these rumors

[00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:56.160]
Before I get into the thing about the plantation brokers. There are massive rumors about this place

[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:02.540]
Being sold this radio station or maybe I'm not sure if it's just this station or if it's a kiss in the power 96 also

[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:08.300]
All three of them the beasley properties and what we have to say that is oh my god are we praying?

[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:12.540]
We got our legs crossed. We got our eyes crossed. We got our fingers crossed. We got our nostrils crossed

[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:16.480]
I'm even wearing a cross. I'm rubbing my rosary beads right now

[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.500]
I'm going to lace him to fill in and whatever else I can get my hands on any any kind of it

[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:23.060]
We're going to rub the Buddha on the head. Hey listen

[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:27.180]
Well sooner or later we'll get to leprechaun and the rub his head to a little bit

[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:31.220]
We'll get some lucky god damn charms is what we'll do anything that might make that come true

[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.920]
Oh god with that be something

[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:37.500]
Halle Luia set us free. Please whoever you are out there the rumored buyers

[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:41.480]
Which I don't want to say too much about it because once these things start leaking out you can screw it all up

[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:44.700]
So I don't want to say too much but the rumors are running rampant

[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.760]
You don't think that's the reason that we're just kind of sitting here like in limbo

[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.960]
Because you know that nobody who's a real broadcaster in their right mind would be running this place this way

[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.480]
So maybe that's so what really is in the wind here

[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:58.120]
Not that I want to get anybody paranoid and psychotic that works for beasley read

[00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.400]
Being such an upstanding company like they are

[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:01.720]
Man

[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:02.880]
Anyway

[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:07.760]
This ties in so directly not that I'm paranoid, but it ties in so exactly

[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:12.040]
With that militant psychotic call that we had on this show last Friday or Thursday

[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:17.460]
I guess it was Friday and it was in yesterday's scum Sentinel right on the heels of that conversation

[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:23.460]
Plantation where I just happened to live in heaven for many years now plantations break B.R.A.K.E. with tradition

[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.320]
Police departments planned a halt motorists to ignore traffic laws

[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.500]
I want you to listen to this because even if you don't live in plantation

[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:33.740]
This should give you an idea of the mentality that we're dealing with here

[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:39.240]
Motorists who drive through the city of plantation should be extra careful to obey the law this month

[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:45.440]
Starting Tuesday meaning today the plantation police department will clamp down on drivers who ignore speed limits

[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:46.860]
One red lights

[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:53.880]
Tailgate don't wear seat belts don't signal or otherwise break the rules of the road patrol officers

[00:52:54.400 --> 00:53:02.300]
In police cruisers and undercover vehicles will be armed with radar and ticket books along all major roadways and school zones in the city

[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:03.620]
Airway driver they see

[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:09.020]
Listen to this airway driver. They see breaking the law will get a warning many will receive tickets

[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.140]
Starting today if you violate a traffic law

[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:18.520]
You're going to be stopped said police kept in Keith Hylgenfeldt who oversees the department's road patrol and motorcycle officers

[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:24.000]
The month-long sting dubbed these no as thing it's a stinger stinging it you feel it they're stinging it

[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:32.280]
dubbed the selective traffic enforcement program step how clever is aimed at discouraging careless driving and decreasing the city's high accident rates

[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:36.460]
Plantation log more than 3000 motor vehicle accidents in 1997

[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:40.400]
According to sergeant Frank Rabino of these more than 480 resulted in injuries

[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:45.200]
We had 15 fatalities in 1996 and six last year that is outrageous

[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:49.240]
Hylgenfeldt said how do you like that? He said not only was it unacceptable?

[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.820]
There was absolutely outrageous. That's what he said

[00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:57.980]
We have a problem and we intend to address that problem Rabino said far too high a percentage of drivers choose to drive in any matter

[00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:04.640]
They desire is this all starting to now once you've listened to the verbiage here far too high a percentage of drivers choose to drive in any

[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.600]
matter they desire would they believe that there was a low risk for enforcement?

[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:13.980]
In many cases Hylgenfeldt said the people who complain the loudest about terrible drivers are the same ones who later get ticketed

[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:21.380]
Police chief C.E. Sonny Sherrod Jr said the point is not to see how many tickets we can ride for revenue or statistics but to educate

[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.840]
The hope is that once people get used to driving safely along the city's major roads

[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:31.920]
They will maintain their good driving habits on smaller residential streets after netting violators to the next three to four waste plans

[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:35.980]
Police plan to reinstate the program several times the year end of quote end of story

[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:41.780]
If that doesn't sound like a carbon copy of the conversation we had with that militant obnoxious

[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:46.920]
Disgusting pork or on Friday on the show. I mean almost word for word is what it sounds like to me

[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:52.020]
Of course, it's only a coincidence because I happen to live in plantation and guess what I'm not wearing those seatbelt

[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:57.620]
I'm going on the year right here with that now today. I am not wearing a seatbelt see that whole seatbelt law

[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:01.080]
Is like telling me what kind of toilet paper I have to wipe my ass with

[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.000]
It's none of your business

[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:07.200]
What I'm doing inside that car unless it affects the way that I drive and by the way wearing a seatbelt

[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:11.120]
And I've tried it does affect the way that I drive that's romantically. Yeah, when you have a big side cup

[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:11.620]
That's right

[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:14.380]
That's exactly correct and if they want I'll get a note from my doctor

[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:19.360]
And I'm very positive I have several doctors who'll be more than happy to write a note saying like an excuse from school

[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:26.400]
Because I got a head cold today that I'm fat pig and that dry and I have diabetes and I blood pressure in this and that and whatever else

[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.700]
An occasional hemorrhoids and as a result

[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:35.280]
I'm cannot wear that seatbelt and if you guys don't have anything better do an addition to which the last time I check pulling somebody over

[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:39.180]
Only for not wearing a seatbelt isn't legal in the state of Florida

[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:41.700]
You have to be violating some other

[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:47.140]
Traffic law before they can pull you over for that is the way I understand the law could be wrong about that

[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:50.900]
Now maybe we'll start pulling people over for passing on the right to look on sunrise

[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:55.500]
Now I applaud I'm all for pulling over dangerous drivers

[00:55:55.500 --> 00:56:00.920]
People who are running red lights people are running stop sign not maybe like not make it a complete stop

[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:03.840]
But people are running stop sign people speeding in school zone

[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:07.240]
I'm coming this morning to work out here on the honeyhill road

[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:11.940]
And I'm slowing down now graded those lights have a work since we had the big storm a couple of weeks ago

[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:17.700]
But any jackass can see what those see those people with the other with the straps the orange straps on standing on the corners

[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:21.060]
Helping the little kids across the street those traffic whatever they call them

[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:24.140]
That means their school in session and the signs is very clearly

[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:29.020]
School zone 8 to 9 a.m. And I'm coming here 25 to 9 or 20 to 9 this morning

[00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:34.340]
And I'm slowing down to my 15 miles an hour and here's this big a sparser in a big truck behind me

[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:39.380]
And this guy is like practically pushing me because he's so pissed off because I'm going 15 miles an hour right on the dot

[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:41.100]
Well, it's a school zone you asshole

[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:46.800]
And there's people speeding through there. I didn't see don't begin any tickets of course people go in 70 miles an hour on sunrise

[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:50.320]
Like I said 80 miles an hour on sunrise and Broward Boulevard

[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:54.300]
People running those lights that I've been talking about forever and of course this business

[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:56.480]
They're going to be equipped with radar and ticket books

[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.120]
Well, that sounds like more of the same to me

[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:01.600]
And if you have aren't you know, why don't you get the speed limits like on hiatus?

[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:05.820]
They're up to where they belong like 45 instead of 35 and then none of us would have who are

[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:08.680]
It all responsible, but have any problem with that

[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:14.240]
But it's very obvious to me that some of those speed limits are said artificially low so that they can do what they've been doing for years

[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.680]
Maybe that's why they have so many fatalities and so many accidents

[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:20.320]
If they haven't been doing a good job of getting the really dangerous drivers off the road

[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:24.420]
And they're sitting there with too many goddamn speed traps. What a concept in plantation, huh?

[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:31.460]
What a concept and sitting around by my house a couple of blocks away off the under of trees under malaluka trees

[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:35.980]
Waiting to see if all four wheels on your car came to a full stop, but it came to that stop sign

[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:38.660]
And maybe just some of those trees got trimmed back by the way

[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:40.960]
So you could see absolutely clear in every direction there

[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:43.180]
Maybe that might be a little help too

[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:46.380]
Instead of having big branches of trees hanging out in the middle of the street

[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:49.560]
So you couldn't see somebody coming if you're life depended on that at certain intersections

[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:53.180]
But this sounds like a militant that sounds exactly like this

[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:55.640]
Porker that called here and it was on a browered line by the way

[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:58.620]
And I'd be willing to bet a lot of money if I could get my bed in which I doubt

[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:04.740]
But if we want a lot of a little bit a lot of money that it was the same porkering that this whole thing is an offshoot of this show

[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:07.880]
Wouldn't surprise the hell out of me. We're gonna show you you faggot

[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.960]
We're gonna show you a thing or two and we'll hang out there right and and by the way

[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:12.700]
If you also want to help save some lives

[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:18.820]
How about it's really nice the city of plantation finally got that light up there at a hundred eighteen to have it when sunrise

[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:19.440]
Boulevard

[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:26.360]
But you know something it's been up there for weeks and all it does is flash and flash it flashes yellow and it flashes red

[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:29.080]
That's all it does it doesn't change anything

[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:36.160]
It's no different than it was before because there are stop signs on the north end of a hundred eighteen and summer and the south

[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.500]
And I'm both sides of that intersection

[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:44.940]
So if you would put that light in the motion put it into a work put it get it working and make it a regular stop light

[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:49.780]
Would like a you know like a real red light would certainly help to control traffic and also stop people try to pull out of there

[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:51.320]
And make a left turn and get and killed

[00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:55.940]
But I realize I understand we're pushing a little bit too hard you want to you want to make us obedient

[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:59.080]
In fact a case of writing business we want to make you obedient like the guy

[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.440]
So we want to condition you to doing things right right

[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:06.400]
Like you're at a condition dangerous drivers and trucking drivers into doing things right

[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.540]
Okay, let's try Miramar. Hello

[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:14.340]
Uncle Neil. Yes, sir. All right. Oh my god that radio yesterday was bad. I thought it was my radio. Thank God

[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:19.220]
It's only your signal. Yeah, sounded like the radio. What mean? Thank God. It's only my signals in that grade

[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:26.520]
Anyway about the porco situation. I hope first on the list are these cops when they're off duty and in their private cars

[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:31.540]
They drive around no, they're not sure what you will wasting your time with it. They're not going to be first on the list

[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:35.300]
They're not going to be on the list. You know what they're not going to be on the list

[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:39.680]
You know that and their family members that's just because they have one of those little badges on their

[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:42.240]
Tag means that they can drive any way they want

[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:47.140]
Well, that's all part of a that whole thing that that whole fraternal order police business and all that the stuff

[00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:50.900]
You put on the bumper. I mean if people really don't get stopped because they weren't at stuff

[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:55.880]
That's one of the biggest the hoaxes in history mankind that asshole that called you last week is probably

[00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:01.440]
The cop that elicit the guys that that drive around and we've in between traffic and how do you know that?

[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.380]
Well because they were like that these cops

[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:07.420]
They drive that's a good point. They think they're above the law they shouldn't be up the law

[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:12.100]
But they don't have to abide by it. Okay. Have a great day pal. Here's Miami. Hello. Yeah, hi

[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.580]
According to the law has turned on

[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.340]
January 1st that that anyone that does not have sleep up on

[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:21.660]
Could people double without doing something else?

[01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:27.120]
It's just started this year. Well, isn't that great? Yeah, because when I had to go to traffic and Google back on

[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:32.580]
January 7th and I bought that point up in the guys on that anymore January 1st

[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:36.200]
If you're caught without a seat belt, they could stop you and if you're caught without a seat belt

[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.280]
Yeah, get that one little petty thing

[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:43.980]
Oh, I better to do I better go out and buy some shaman today because I don't think I got the right kind of toilet paper my house either

[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:50.360]
There you go. Thanks for the good news and closing. Yes. Can I shame this request? Yeah, the Japanese are called and

[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.520]
Chinese don't get the judge in the

[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.300]
The Chinese the Chinese don't get to put a chick in the armor there. Were you all right? Okay. I'll work on it

[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:01.960]
You like a great cigar. I should do boy. What's life without a good cigar?

[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:05.780]
If you're a guy or woman who wants to be a guy or who just wants to be a much a woman whatever

[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:11.660]

9907 puts some real enjoyable pleasure in your post real soon from our friends at Nix cigar

[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:10.180]
All the way to the next to my

[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.260]
What you gotta do

[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:19.320]
You have to fight for hold her safe

[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.100]
I was more than happy

[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:27.100]
And now there's more I'd like to do

[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:32.460]
I want to get there but she won't let me

[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:39.520]
I want to live there so we have been in her years

[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:48.200]
I want to hold her behind closed doors more

[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:54.200]
I want to get there but she won't let me

[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:54.340]
I want to get there

[01:02:54.340 --> 01:03:01.580]
When she returns she said she was an actress

[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.600]
She showed me an album a picture of her opening

[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.220]
Which he then said no

[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.000]
She seemed to be she could be

[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.160]
But I was a clear-listy

[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:20.420]
She was a kind girl

[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.220]
And hard

[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:31.140]
I want to get there but she won't let me

[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:34.740]
I want to live there

[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.380]
We have been in her years

[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:46.960]
I want to hold her behind closed doors more

[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:53.200]
I want to conserve her but she won't let me

[01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:00.880]
Well, I'll never forget that train right down to our film

[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:07.900]
We're saved as late and we shared our tales

[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.960]
But as my heart flies to leave her behind

[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:17.200]
And regrets are all my pride

[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:22.980]
Because I've got you said through in the end

[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.220]
I want to get her but she won't let me

[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.980]
I want to live there so we have been in her years

[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:46.580]
I want to hold her behind closed doors more

[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:59.860]
I want to get there but she won't let me

[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:00.340]
I want to get there

[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:07.400]
There was once a time that all that long ago a few years ago we couldn't play that on the year

[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.600]
That was one of our censored pieces of material

[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:15.080]
And that leads right in its segways right on this back which is a new one

[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:17.720]
We had this story yesterday in Texas about the t-shirt

[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:21.080]
Another habitual t-shirt violator this one in Ocala

[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.980]
Jury selection began Monday in the trial of a 24-year-old Florida man

[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:26.080]
A trial

[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.080]
They're having a trial over this okay

[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:34.960]
Charged with obscenity over a t-shirt featuring a bear-breasted nun and calling Jesus a profane name

[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.920]
How do you like that?

[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.280]
A bear-breasted nun probably

[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.340]
This is a married Catherine Jesus

[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.960]
That sums it all up I guess

[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:46.120]
Record store clerk Andrew Love was wearing a division of record store clerk

[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:50.580]
Wearing a new t-shirt promoting the British death metal band cradle of filth in November

[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:53.040]
When security offers at no Cala shopping mall

[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.500]
Told him to turn the garment inside out or leave

[01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:01.140]
Before he was able to reverse the shirt Ocala police showed up arrested him and confiscated the shirt

[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:05.000]
The shirt shows a bear-breasted woman in a nun's habit reaching between her legs

[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.040]
On the back are the words Jesus is a using the crude term for female genitalia

[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:10.920]
The seaword

[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:14.900]
I know it's offensive Love said since when it is against the law to be offensive

[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:18.600]
Love continued the shirt was not obscene but prosecutor Steve Rogers

[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.040]
No relation thank God disagreed

[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:24.840]
Love was never jailed on the misdemeanor charge was released on his own reconnaissance if convicted

[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:27.740]
He could be fined $1,000 in sentence to a year in jail

[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:30.880]
Along with all those other habitual like pot smokers probably

[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.780]
Florida law defines obscenity

[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:36.740]
If something the average person believes would appeal the way perian shameful or morbid interest

[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:41.080]
Something is obscene if a depicted or described sexual material in a patently offensive

[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:45.240]
Oh here we go with this again and lacks serious literary artistic political scientific value

[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:50.100]
Which means that none of those postcards that they sell their Amsterdam on street corners out in the public

[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:54.620]
Would they be able to sell here of course like the ones that had showed the Pope sitting on the throne taking a dump

[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:59.560]
In this community meaning O'Calla the t-shirt is definitely political said loves attorney Jim Reich

[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:05.040]
He said the case had sparked an outcry from fans of cradle of filth civil libertarians and those of the anarchistic bent

[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:10.640]
Reich argued loves arrest amounted to unlawful prior restraint because police officers determined on their own

[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.180]
That the t-shirt was obscene

[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:18.300]
Merrient county judge Sandra Edward Stevens rejected that argument and opening statements were expected to start in the case two days

[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:24.920]
Another habitual t-shirt violator so don't give me no sign of dance about American first amendment rights because we don't have any

[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:29.380]
That's what it boils down to we have the word police we have the bumper sticker police we have the word police now

[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:36.780]
We got to goddamn t-shirt police remember in Hollywood not too many years ago in mayor of Galantia had the t-shirt police arrestings about young people in Hollywood beach

[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:40.520]
First of all why would young people want to be in Hollywood beach anyway with all the old frogs

[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:44.800]
But number two they were wearing t-shirts that said disgusting things which were like by the way

[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:52.680]
Pailed into insignificant compared that one so there you go with some more good police work in America as the you hear the boots stop and all over the place baby

[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:58.560]
So those rumors must be right this they must be planning on unloading this joint. Oh, it's all over the place

[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:04.720]
I heard a rumor on the radio just a little while ago the QAM is being sold that's what I hear oh my god you listen

[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:13.360]
No, there's no way that I could convey to this audience how desperately we George and I and many others but now speak for ourselves

[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:24.800]
How we pray that that's true pray is the understanding like I said I'll turn to religion I'll become born again I'll be I'll put on my white shirt in the tie and ride a bicycle

[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:28.680]
I'll do anything okay that's right. I'll even put on that magic underwear

[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:33.920]
I don't give a crap anything at this point just to try to bring that to fruition and make it a reality

[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:42.020]
Because these people here man I am they are clueless it's not like they're a little bit off they're way off in La La land

[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:48.380]
They're so far removed from anything that has to do with radio broadcasting that it's like we're talking about a Chinese freaking laundry

[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:54.780]
And they could even screw that up and I forgot that Chinese restaurant but it being hanged on I'll get around with just hang with New Palace one of these there's a plant

[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:56.220]
Here's Tamarack hello

[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.520]
Yes sir

[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:00.900]
Yeah I'm responding to the article that you just read about the t-shirt

[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:01.720]
Yes sir

[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:07.800]
Yeah I was working in plantation seven years ago near the corner that you talked about a lot but I was a little bit about a university

[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:14.760]
I heard you had the flip-top of the crop saying out right and the guy I was working for why were the spreading goods we had a lot of escape t-shirts

[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:18.780]
And we got the words that there has been a point of being

[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:27.900]
And we got a complaint from one of the cops that said a woman had called and they were going to come down and they were going to confiscate the shirts and so forth

[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:30.580]
Yeah because they probably wanted to give away his gifts to their girlfriends

[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:40.460]
But anyway I told the boss I said just leave the shirts out there and what the ships probably they may and what they're going to do

[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:42.100]
What the shirts were they may right

[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:48.140]
Exactly but he could fervent any any any took the t-shirts down and kicked in because he didn't want any problems

[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:50.100]
I was wanting to let it go all the way

[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:51.300]
Yeah I'm going to shoot

[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:55.260]
Like you see that you know I figured the first amendment would protect me but I did

[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:55.980]
Oh yeah right

[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:59.260]
I guess you're in a dream world man you're in La La Land there's no first amendment

[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:02.040]
It's an arbitrary thing the cops make it up as they go along

[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.840]
Oh we find that and that's offensive that's obscene okay

[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:08.320]
We got to know that these were just the one he's about to scurry

[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:13.760]
You know I can compare to what you're talking about but it was decided to that you just mentioned

[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:20.400]
And it's interesting enough you're in the plantation the cops were very good because they at least took the fath

[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.640]
And they told us what was going to happen and they've been very friendly to us

[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.340]
So those are the ones you talked about that I always have the coffee at that place

[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:29.820]
Right oh they sure do well I make a good cup of coffee I'll tell you that

[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:30.240]
Definitely

[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:31.780]
Okay congratulations sir

[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:35.000]
And I'm just responding and I'm glad you cleaned up your act

[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:35.640]
Okay, bye bye

[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:42.720]
We got the dirty language t-shirt police going out baby you have to be kidding me

[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.240]
What the hell are you doing and what are you doing in Amsterdam?

[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:46.460]
And Neil?

[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:50.160]
Yes I love this apartment we have it you welcome to use it

[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:56.460]
We have one block from the marijuana hash you see

[01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:59.500]
Which means we're a half a block for the red light dish

[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:02.820]
Don't keep your damn windows closed for Christchurch all you need to do is get the munchies

[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:03.840]
That'll be the end of you

[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:04.620]
It's true

[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:06.360]
You don't need any assistance

[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.340]
Neil I want you to use this place I love it I love Amsterdam

[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:12.300]
It took six days to get a phone

[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.320]
But it is wonderful the food is great

[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.400]
The bakery is so good

[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.960]
No fish food I'm stood on

[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:23.900]
No no I just want to send you loving kisses and I that way here will be back in New York

[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:29.140]
Wednesday in Florida, Sandy and I want you to use the apartment it would be a joy to share this

[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:30.060]
Oh I definitely will

[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:31.240]
You got it

[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.020]
And how's the weather there now?

[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:35.700]
You know it's not too bad 56 degrees

[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:39.000]
They're surprised because it's a very warm winter

[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:39.520]
Yeah

[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:41.760]
But it's such a civilized town

[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:42.220]
Yeah

[01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:47.520]
By the way I just I would like you very like me rarely do you make a mistake

[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:51.500]
But I watched one of the tapes you sent me with the excerpts from Midnight Blue

[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:55.060]
And one more you were talking about Amsterdam and what a great country it is

[01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:55.260]
Yes

[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:59.620]
Amsterdam is a city not a country I don't want to get confused the Netherlands Holland has got two names

[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:05.200]
But last time I checked Amsterdam was only a city but you know only that we had a country the whole country would be like that

[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.420]
I know but with a joint in my mouth I didn't care

[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:08.420]
Yeah that's true

[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:09.280]
How do you feel?

[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:12.220]
And most of that movie I'd see your mouth on something else but I don't want to get in with

[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:13.360]
We don't want to talk about that

[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.240]
No we don't

[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.560]
I'll be back in town next week I'll have to see you

[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.780]
In fact that's when I had a relapse so I was feeling pretty good and then I put that video in just to see what it was all about

[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:24.460]
And watching you apply that tongue insert I mean oh

[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:29.080]
Why do you allow this thing having any kind of a sexual experience is such a gross up?

[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:31.160]
You lose your appetite for months

[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:31.780]
Well I do

[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.280]
Well I've never heard his bits

[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.260]
I'm a little bit

[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:37.180]
Wait a minute wait a minute you never heard just a second

[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:40.160]
You see your talking when you listen

[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.140]
That's a great club you moron

[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:43.660]
You're looking for glory holes

[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:44.600]
No they are guided dumping

[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:45.340]
I know

[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:49.900]
Mr. Al Goldstein presents the art of taking a dump

[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:56.060]
Oh what I like to do is place a TV tray in front of me when I go

[01:12:56.900 --> 01:13:00.660]
It gives me a way of expediting the food I enjoy

[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:05.940]
I have my corn flakes today

[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:10.000]
Corn is good it goes right through

[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:16.720]
It also helps to have a few pictures of glory and learn it around

[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:22.880]
But what I truly enjoy is the luxury of bathroom acoustics

[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.360]
I always keep a karaoke machine nearby

[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:29.720]
This way I can enjoy the acoustics when I sing

[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:39.720]
Fart and poop and splat and sploop and spewing and spray and strain in my heart

[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:44.000]
Don't care if it's real or a fun

[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:52.380]
So when you have to make don't hold it in

[01:13:53.500 --> 01:14:00.120]
When I gotta do some pictures of improvement best joining my poopies here

[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.960]
And if I feel good when I'm full

[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.480]
That's a healthy

[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:09.060]
That's a healthy

[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.260]
How do you like that?

[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:17.480]
That's wonderful meal

[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.240]
What a great tribute to Al Goldstein

[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:21.260]
Next week I'll see you at the track

[01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:22.420]
Maybe I'll win some money

[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:24.520]
Fat Rich stole 200 dollars

[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:27.360]
Oh you never give me the money back

[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.020]
Never give me the money back

[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:30.100]
He's fed you the poop

[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:31.020]
Okay

[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:32.280]
Neil thank you

[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:33.080]
I'll be here yourself

[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.300]
Okay go smoke some for us

[01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.840]
Al Goldstein and I'm stood out and talk about dangerous

[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.320]
Or at least they don't have any good food there

[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:39.920]
He'll find it

[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:47.120]
Yeah I couldn't find it but do you want some for sale?

[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:48.120]

Yeah

[01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.240]
Okay how long is your second okay?

[01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:12.380]
Yeah?

[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:14.200]
You got a rest off for sale?

[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:15.100]

I need to know how to do it

[01:15:59.000 --> 01:15:59.500]
How much is it?

[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:02.880]
So you want to buy a stock for sale?

[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.080]
No, I need to know

[01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:07.040]
Okay I'll be right there

[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:07.560]
Okay

That's all for sale?

[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:18.560]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay. Hopefully I turn out better than the others.

[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:24.480]
You, you, um, you've been getting a lot of tickets like everybody else. It's a few traps and I just got three.

[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:30.940]
I've been doing what? Getting a lot of tickets. No, I have not. I haven't had a ticket in years. Well, you talk about a lot.

[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:35.720]
Yeah. I talk about it a lot because I don't think that that's law enforcement is having speed traps.

[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:44.740]
Yeah. That's not law enforcement. I agree with you. I get them all the time. But what would you say if I gave you a suggestion how you yourself could change the system?

[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:50.680]
Yeah. If you would promote because you know, never go down the road and see a speed trap. Yeah.

[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:57.880]
Somebody in the opposite direction has the headlights on blinking in warning. Right, which is against the law, by the way. It is. Uh-huh. How about just putting your headlights on?

[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:05.160]
Well, that's okay. But if you would promote something like that, I mean, it's against the law, but we all should be doing it. I always have promoted that.

[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:10.560]
And the cop, that's the couple, put you over and give you a ticket for that too, by the way. I think it's very pissed off if you do that.

[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:19.380]
What was that broken? Huh? I think you can't give a ticket because I feel like a bunch of that. Well, who knows. I have no idea because you're screwing with their game. Don't you understand?

[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:28.420]
They resent that. That's why they resent me because I've been talking for weeks now about the silly stop sign police implantation and about the radar traps on hiatus wrote.

[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:35.180]
So now they're taking it out on me and now they're going to take it out on everybody else because they're pissed off over there. Somebody peed in their coffee at the food spot, I guess.

[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:46.120]
Yeah. I don't know how. For as long as I can remember on this show, we've done these pig reports where people call in and they tell us wherever there are speed traps. We put it right on the air.

[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:53.940]
That's the best thing that I can do and we will continue doing it. How would they be able to give you a ticket though just for putting a headlight on you're asking me who knows.

[01:17:54.280 --> 01:18:03.280]
All I know is that they do threaten. They they have full people over. They make them psychotic because for whatever reason, they say that they're not supposed to do that.

[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:10.540]
Just like they say that you're supposed to wear a seatbelt and they say that you're not supposed to pick your nose with the index finger of your right hand. Only your left. Have a great day, sir.

[01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:20.080]
Put on my seatbelt yesterday when I left here for the first time in a long time just to see what it was like wearing a seatbelt. I don't like it. I hate it. Very constricting. It's very uncomfortable.

[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:27.160]
But of course in this town since most people are see this is like the guy to call for Massachusetts yesterday about what Jerry Williams did on a radio years ago.

[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:32.140]
And he got the seatbelt law repealed the federal government intimidated them and made him put it back in and we instate the law.

[01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:40.440]
The government's got no business. We're hard telling you what to do inside your car any more than they have to tell you what to do inside your house.

[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:47.880]
The only thing they can tell you what to do inside your house is you don't like beat up your pet or your kids or your wife or anybody else because that affects somebody else.

[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:54.600]
And just like the example I used yesterday the government telling you what kind of toilet paper you got to use or which hand to wipe with. It's no different.

[01:18:54.600 --> 01:19:02.660]
Oh, but it's for your safety. No, it's not for your safety. It's just another way that you give up freedom and let the government intrude where they have no business.

[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:07.540]
How about letting the government send inspectors to your house at night to see who's doing what in the bedrooms?

[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:18.840]
I don't see a hell of a lot of difference. It's none of their business. It's insurance company bull crap. It's revenue raising bull crap and you cops and plantation. I got news for you. I'm wearing my seatbelt.

[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:31.420]
Are you? Yes, I am. I understand I wasn't even homeless. I understand there was a plantation porker parked right in the corner and I pulled somebody over for a not coming to a full stop at the stop sign there right by my house right by the house.

[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:42.860]
What a coincidence. Doesn't phase me in the least and this obnoxious arrogant prick that called issue on Friday. And I wouldn't be surprised if it's this hill gun felt guy because his quotes.

[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:49.760]
You know, the more I read, I got this one little column from yesterday's for Monday's paper and the more I like and there's one line in many cases.

[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:56.160]
Hilton felt said the people who complain the loudest about terrible drivers are the same ones who later get ticketed. Who could he be referring to?

[01:19:56.380 --> 01:20:03.960]
Yeah, who is he referring to? The people who complain the loudest about bad drivers? Who is that? You open your window. Do you hear anybody out there complaining?

[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:13.940]
Later, get ticketed. See, I hate to break the news to you, Sergeant. Whatever your name is. Captain Sergeant, no time for sergeants, but I happen to be a damn good driver and a safe and responsible driver.

[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:23.620]
And even though I got a car that will go very, very fast, I got drive very, very fast. And yes, I do resent when people go by. I mean, there are a couple of things that really piss me off.

[01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:27.940]
Number one, when I'm trying to go close to the speed limit and somebody is right on my ass.

[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:37.320]
Tailgating because they're trying to push me because I'm not going fast enough to suit them. And if I'm speeding, if I'm going seven miles over the speed limit, they're right on my ass because I'm not going fast enough for them.

[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:46.700]
I'm not getting the ticket to make them happy. Okay, tough crap. If you want to pass me around two WL lines, go right ahead and take your chances, baby. But I'm not speeding up to make you happy.

[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:56.000]
And the other thing is when I'm going like 52 and a 45 on sunrise and some asshole like George goes by me 75 miles an hour on sunrise, Boulevard, that really forced my ass.

[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:02.240]
I go with the flow. I was only going to what I'm going to be on the road. 65 or when I'm going 70 on the turnpike where the speed limit is 65.

[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:08.360]
And that's about what I drive around 70 and a 65 and nothing wrong with that. And somebody goes by me going 95 miles an hour.

[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:14.740]
And I never ever see any of those people get it pisses me off because those people are a menace. You people are crazy.

[01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:19.320]
And yes, you should be getting tickets, but the problem is they're not the ones who get the tickets, baby.

[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:23.800]
The ones who get the speeding tickets are the ones who get caught in all these little radar traps that we set up.

[01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:28.420]
So don't give me a song in advance about you're trying to save lives. You're trying to condition people.

[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:36.760]
The drunks continue driving drunk and getting their licenses back and the chronic high speeders continue driving 85, 90, 100 miles an hour.

[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:43.320]
And you know it and I know it. So go freshen up the coffee at the food spot and plantation and cut the crap because you're not full on me.

[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:48.660]
You're not full of anybody else and you're sure as hell not intimidated me. You can make as many phone calls to this show as you want.

[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:53.820]
Doesn't phase me in the least, but I'll be wearing my seatbelt. Slow down and plantation.

[01:21:54.060 --> 01:22:00.020]
By the way, you don't want to get no tickets and buckle up your seat belt and make a full stop and sit there for about half an hour at the stop sign.

[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:04.900]
And guess what they still don't have the light working at 118th Avenue in sunrise Boulevard.

[01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:09.740]
The light's still flashing there useless useless as teats on a caterpillar.

[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:16.000]
That's how worthwhile that light is there. But oh, we don't want all these vitality. Well, and how about getting that light working?

[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:23.980]
Okay. And one thing I will say since I do a grid of credit where credit is doing she one of the reasons they're kicked off the plantation cups is they had a great

[01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:32.580]
thing going there for months. Even back when we're still on here in Paxon. Remember I used to talk about that 30 mile an hour thing, the construction thing on sunrise and they would just sit there right and visit.

[01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:39.020]
And really you had no way of knowing where it stopped and where it started. That's one of the famous scams with construction zones.

[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:47.380]
Is you really can't be sure where it stops and where it ends. And there was no reason for their most days to even days when there was no construction going on 30 miles an hour.

[01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:54.020]
So they're upset because they finally did a great construction job there. And you know, there was some inconvenience to those of us who live out there in West Broward.

[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:59.260]
But you know something they did a hell of a job, the DOT or whoever it is that we really give anybody credit.

[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:05.540]
They did a fine job at sunrise. Boulevard now is a wide six lane highway out there all the way to where the arena is going to be.

[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:12.580]
It's a Mahaya man. Nice job guys. All they got to do is put the reflectors down. That'll be all done and fixed that stop light and make it work.

[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:19.500]
But that's one of the reasons that they got to do all this other business is because that was it. That was like shooting fish in a barrel man. That was that was a piece of cake.

[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:28.340]
Who's going to be going 30 miles an hour on a four lane, a big four or five lane, whatever the hell it was at the time. Highway, especially on a road where Georgia is going 70 miles an hour.

[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:36.140]
There's the one you want to get after is Georgia Rodriguez. Okay. Are you plantation porkers and wherever else in sunrise you're driving? Where is it for a lot of day? What part of sunrise?

[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:44.600]
Like university in sunrise. Yeah, plantation. There you go. There's one for you in his beige Toyota four runner. Okay. He's going 70 miles an hour.

[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:57.500]
That's a huge. What? It's desert. It's it's a huge place. It's number. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Never mind me. Yes, I'm driving home on the after all is hot going to try to go about these cops and all this bull crap.

[01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:03.600]
And I'm driving home on the turnpike. And here's an asshole in a green van. And he's like in the I'm in the middle lane on the turnpike.

[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:11.580]
He's in the left hand lane. He's about to go by me. But of course he sees the car. Obviously he knows what it and now he hits the break and he sits out there and he kind of backs up.

[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:23.500]
And I like he's looking over my shoulder. Was that where my seatbelt? No, no, I was not. But I am wearing my seatbelt now. All you plantation porkers. I don't want to give you an easy target on an event of new product. It's just a sash.

[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:29.720]
It looks like a seatbelt and you just put it on and sit down and it looks like that's not a new product. Oh, it's not. They've already know it's not. Oh, sorry.

[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:39.400]
See if I'd called that. Now when do I get one of those? Yeah, you go and see there. Not only does he go 70 miles an hour on sunrise right in the middle of plantation nearby university and his

[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:53.460]
a piece of desert doing for runner. He's also advocating violent while lawbreakers. He's the one not me. I'm the safe driver. He in fact rich. The two maniacs. There isn't man. It drives 90 miles an hour in the school zone. That's how fast he goes. This man is out of control.

[01:24:53.700 --> 01:25:00.160]
The fat man. Well, he's fat. He's got a heavy foot, which by the way my foot is still killing me. I think I need acupuncture from that crack.

[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:30.140]
I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor.

am a doctor. I am a doctor. I am a doctor. I am a doctor. I am a doctor. I am a doctor. I'm a doctor. I am Meinung D. Herbine. Herbine drainage law accused of

[01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:33.780]
twenty-two years in the business. Yes, it's you know, I was arguing some

[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:37.260]
antics with a friend of mine and it's not really an opinionated answer. I mean,

[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:42.780]
it's fact somewhere. When you were bought out, you know, your contract. Yeah. We were

[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:46.140]
arguing that I was saying you were unemployed. He was saying you were still

[01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:49.880]
employed by the people. Of course I wasn't unemployed. I was being paid to a

[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:53.260]
goal of vacation. I wasn't unemployed. Yeah. Well, I mean, we were like I said

[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:57.780]
arguing some antics. You were you weren't working. Yeah. Right. That was

[01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:00.320]
basically what I was when I was. Well, what's what's the point? What's

[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:03.320]
different doesn't make what you call it? I'd like to be unemployed like that

[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:07.420]
the rest of my life. So what was unemployed? Huh? You were employed. Let me see.

[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:10.840]
Yeah, I was not unemployed. I was employed. I just didn't have to show up. I

[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:13.960]
got a check. I came and picked up a check every week. You can't be unemployed and get

[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:19.880]
paid. Well, no, did they consider that employed? Absolutely. Yes. Well, I

[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:24.340]
figured it was something like a great day, pal. Oh my god. Oh, the world is

[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:29.800]
coming to an end with that call right there. That's it. That's the end. I

[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.360]
actually had a feeling for about an hour and a half today that we were going to

[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.600]
make it today that we really were going to have a show. We're going to have some

[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:39.120]
real zippity doodos and real people on this phone. Forget it. I mean, talk about

[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:42.540]
get a life. Well, it's really semantic. Yeah, semantics. People have argue

[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:46.000]
semantics are people in desperate search of life. Here's a mobile in four

[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.100]
lottery. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Good old story. When I first came down here

[01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:55.760]
right out of college to become a school teacher, I went downtown Miami and

[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:59.020]
crossed the street there and came on out and as I came out and crossed the

[01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:03.140]
street again, it was a cop there. Yeah. And he said to Jay walking. And I said, Jay

[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:06.520]
walking. And he pointed a sign out, showing off. There's a sign. Says, Jay walking.

[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:10.980]
So I said, okay, well, I guess it's give me a second. So he said, let me see a

[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:13.980]
license. I said, I'm walking. I'm not driving. You don't need to see my license.

[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:19.200]
So he says, is this your car? I said, yeah, but I'm not driving it. He says, well, it's

[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:24.360]
a part of the expired meter. I said, oh, my God. Give me a ticket for that. So he

[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.280]
gives me a ticket for Jay walking. He says, you'll cross the street when you

[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:31.720]
want in. I said, yeah, he says, okay. So he gave me two Jay walking tickets. Then he

[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.260]
gave me an expired meter ticket. Then he gave me a ticket because there was a

[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:38.760]
no there was a construction sign next to the car. And he gave me a ticket for

[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:43.340]
parking a restricted zone. And then he says, I refuse to give my driver's

[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:48.600]
license. He gave me a ticket for no license. Handcrafted me. Had my car

[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.960]
towed and sent me to jail. Went to court a couple days later. The judge read

[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:56.740]
the thing called me up call the cop up. He said to the copy, he said, first of all,

[01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:59.580]
you're going to pay for his car. Then you towed. Secondly, you're going to

[01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:02.940]
reimburse him for his time. And if I ever see you coming to my court with this

[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:05.340]
kind of crab again, I'm going to get you off the force.

[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:11.220]
Oh, great, great story, sir. That was it. Congratulations. Don't do it again.

[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:15.500]
Okay. Honey, like that. See that that cop was one of those bricks that I'm

[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:18.320]
talking about. Oh, it's in which we can probably people. And there are plenty

[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:21.140]
of those. If you're visiting, if you're one of the snowboards down here and you're

[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:24.360]
tuned in today by accident, wondering what it's all about. This is what this

[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.780]
town is all about. Okay. It's a bunch of dead people walking around,

[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:30.240]
but you're dead people driving. It's a bunch of people who have moved and they

[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.940]
moved their lips a lot. They don't say too much. They don't have an opinion

[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:36.760]
about anything. And yet somehow I've survived 22 years in the midst of all of

[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:41.320]
this. How is that possible? How in God's name is that possible? Man, oh man, I

[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:44.680]
was thinking about that the other day, thinking about surviving 22 years with a

[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:47.320]
bunch of dead heads. And the minute that it came, that thought came to my

[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:53.180]
mind. I pooped my pants. Oh, God. I just let loose 22 years of frustration of

[01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:58.780]
trying to coerce a force people to like say something. Have an opinion. Get

[01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:02.820]
some, get some passion. There is no passion. That's the thing that is lacking in

[01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:07.400]
this town is passion. It doesn't exist. Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:08.820]
Hello. Yeah. Yes, sir.

[01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:14.000]
Handing me a cop story for you. Yeah. Coconut Creek PD. All right. I'm going up

[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.860]
Ryan's road. He felt on three or four miles an hour to speed limit. Two

[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:21.560]
motorcycle cops. One of them shoot this thing. Anything nothing out of it. One of

[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:24.400]
them all of a sudden I look at my rear view, I go past them, look at my rear view,

[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:28.200]
one of them behind me. What did I do? So he posed me over. I asked him,

[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.840]
that's what I do. How nice. Where are you going?

[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:34.540]
About the rear four over. Three or four miles over this pyramid. So let me finish.

[01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:41.540]
So he says the tent on your windshield extends too far down the windshield. I said,

[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:47.120]
well, wait a minute. I said, Neil, get this. It's factory kit. It comes from the factory

[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:52.740]
that way. It's inside the glass. Oh. So he writes me a ticket. I'll take it for what?

[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:58.560]
For what was it? Because your thing is too long. Yeah, the thing was too long. So he

[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:02.120]
writes me a ticket. I'll never get a ticket for that. Oh, then now listen to this.

[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:07.140]
Not only do I have to pay the ticket, but I have to bring the car to Coconut Creek PD

[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:12.280]
to prove that I comply with whatever I got to go. I got to go put a new windshield in

[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:16.460]
the car. Oh my God. I swear to God. Unbelievable.

[01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:20.300]
There you go. Wrist my case pal. In closing? And your paint is salary, yeah.

[01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:24.180]
Yes sir. In closing? Yes. Okay. Let's take a boi-ton beach. Hello.

[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:29.020]
How's it going? Pretty good. I don't envy your position. These people have been sitting

[01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:32.680]
here. God knows why for about a half an hour waiting for you. The guy with 6 minutes and

[01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:37.360]
6 seconds. The guy with place, Mr. what the hell was he talking about? I haven't got

[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:41.180]
any idea. Oh, I think he was talking about Mark Foreset. I swear to God I was going to

[01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:45.000]
hang up after him. But, I'm not interested. I'm sure. Never. I'm sure. I'm sure I'm

[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.580]
sure. I love Farah Foreset. Not now. I used to. But anyway. One of the measurements

[01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:53.460]
you said actually she got beat up by that intruder that time of the spray member. And she

[01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:57.020]
tied him up and put him in a fireplace. What was the name of that movie George? Well that

[01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:57.660]
was a good movie.

[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:02.680]
While he beat the crap out of it.

[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.560]
Yeah, I played college hockey, love hockey.

[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:06.920]
Unfortunately, a Ranger fan.

[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:08.840]
But a few other things South Florida.

[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:10.260]
I moved down here about two years ago.

[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.120]
Now you're talking born from Boston.

[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:13.520]
From Long Island.

[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:14.580]
It's terrible here.

[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:18.020]
And Miami is the armpit of the United States.

[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:18.980]
It's the most place to be.

[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.380]
South Beach, a bunch of weirdos down there.

[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:24.320]
A bunch of drug addicts, but the composers, muscle bomb

[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:25.060]
posing facts.

[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:27.620]
And these cars with the Manishbox wheels, it's

[01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:28.580]
stick out 10 feet.

[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:30.800]
And the shorts down the middle of their ass crack.

[01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:31.160]
Right.

[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:33.040]
Religion is another thing.

[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:33.480]
Yeah.

[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:35.440]
I'm a first time caller, last time caller,

[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:36.600]
because I don't have time to call you.

[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.720]
But I want to get a few more things off with you.

[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:39.220]
Go ahead.

[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:41.500]
Religion, I totally agree with you.

[01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:42.480]
I laughed in the car.

[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:44.820]
It is the biggest bunch of crap.

[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:45.300]
Yeah.

[01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:47.220]
The Bible is a fictional story.

[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:49.660]
I can see the guys writing the Bible way back when all

[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:52.120]
drunk around the table, laughing, telling stories.

[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:54.000]
Well, I mean, people have been inventing gods

[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.180]
and the side of those steps.

[01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:56.580]
They're going out since the beginning of time.

[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.820]
And anybody, anybody who's got even a tiny ability to think

[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:02.680]
for himself or for yourself knows that and would just laugh

[01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:03.360]
at this crap.

[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:05.820]
But the sad part of it is that people don't want to think.

[01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:06.680]
You get chastised.

[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:08.400]
That's why, if you say anything today.

[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:10.580]
Anyway, I would be happy to tell the women out there.

[01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:10.880]
OK.

[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:11.740]
I had a heterosexual.

[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:12.980]
I love women.

[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:16.760]
But this is women powered bullsh**ts going on right now.

[01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:18.200]
What the hell is that all about?

[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:18.700]
OK.

[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:20.740]
And to pal, OK, said crap.

[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:22.240]
And I just, he's getting a little worked up.

[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:25.300]
I left him on there, but bullcrap is right.

[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:26.320]
So you can't say shot.

[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:27.900]
You can take one, but you can't say it.

[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:30.100]
Because this is America and after all, just like the things

[01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:31.480]
I brought up about the t-shirt, please.

[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:33.120]
Got almost no response about that.

[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.700]
See, you people are so conditioned.

[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:38.220]
I mean, the couple called Friday was right about that.

[01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:41.080]
We want to condition you to doing fill in the blank.

[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:44.120]
To being nice and obedient and whatever it is.

[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:45.100]
We're going to condition you.

[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:46.800]
Even if you shouldn't have to be doing this,

[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:48.600]
we're going to condition you to doing this.

[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:51.760]
Because we decided that you can't wear a t-shirt that says this.

[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:54.540]
And you can't have a bumper sticker that says that.

[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:55.860]
Here's a mobile in sunrise.

[01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:56.260]
Hello.

[01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:57.680]
Hey, Neil, how you doing today?

[01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:58.040]
Great.

[01:33:58.460 --> 01:33:59.880]
You know what ticks us all off?

[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:03.000]
Neil is the fact that you have these cops working over time

[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.160]
by the saw grass.

[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:07.200]
You know, he's supposed to stick the 50 cents in those

[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.940]
at Oakham Park in commercial.

[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:12.040]
And they get you, if you don't stick the 50 cents

[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:15.340]
in the little hole there, these cops are working on O.T.

[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:19.360]
This is the most amazing thing that a cop is getting paid

[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:20.520]
to even do these things.

[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:20.620]

[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:22.440]
Well, listen, pay the 50 cents and cut the crap.

[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:23.740]
You know what that reminds me of?

[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:25.080]
Oh, I think it was yesterday.

[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:25.980]
I should have brought it.

[01:34:26.100 --> 01:34:28.060]
And there was a letter to the editor from some old fart.

[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:30.460]
Your telly was an old fart by the nature of the letter.

[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:34.540]
And this guy was complaining because he had gotten a ticket.

[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:36.900]
He went through the toll booth like a turnpike or somewhere.

[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:38.740]
And the arm was stuck up in the air.

[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:41.140]
And the green light was stuck in the on position.

[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:42.920]
So he just goes through.

[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:45.480]
He doesn't put in his 50 cents, his 75 cents,

[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.660]
because the green light is on.

[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:48.760]
And then he's belly, and then he gets a ticket.

[01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:50.120]
Well, guess what, pal?

[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:52.360]
Just because the thing is stuck doesn't mean

[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:54.620]
it's an invitation to just go right through you asshole.

[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:55.960]
Well, I thought it was a free date.

[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:56.540]
Yeah, right.

[01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:59.120]
It's like that salad dressing free.

[01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:01.480]
I'll never forget that if I live in the B 500.

[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:02.940]
And I didn't make this up.

[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:04.360]
It's a true goddamn story.

[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:06.820]
Seven years ago, I mean, my public's over there.

[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:08.280]
It's got to be like four or five years ago.

[01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:10.640]
And this old bag is in front of me in line.

[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.520]
And of course, he's making a big to do.

[01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:13.940]
She got like six items on there.

[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:16.060]
And everybody's like, oh, how much is this?

[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:16.940]
But I beat, but I'm up.

[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:18.640]
And then the girl takes, you know,

[01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:21.200]
the bottle of craft salad dressing

[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:23.360]
and puts it through the scanner there.

[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:26.180]
And a woman says, wait a minute, what'd you do that for?

[01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:27.520]
And the girl looks at her, what do you mean?

[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:29.600]
It says right in the bottle, free.

[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:34.800]
Fat free, you stupid old disgusting obnoxious idiotic.

[01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:37.840]
I mean, God, that fucking bitch, free.

[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:40.300]
So why didn't you get 20 or 30 of them, by the way?

[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:42.840]
Only in Florida, baby, only in this town.

[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.100]
Only where the living people are really dead,

[01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:45.780]
masquerading.

[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:48.280]
No, Charles Alfieri doesn't have any surprises for you.

[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:49.820]
What he's got is a great looking head in here.

[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:52.740]
My dad knocked the office.

[01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:54.900]
He makes me win.

[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.220]
He tied me up.

[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:00.120]
When I was young, the name is me.

[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:01.080]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:03.340]
I was killed by my daddy.

[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:05.440]
And what's up?

[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:07.340]
My dad knocked me over.

[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:10.400]
I was a kid, a dream.

[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:14.240]
It's got a media message.

[01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:18.560]
I'm a woman who knows.

[01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:24.220]
He beats me and beats me with the mouth, they're ho.

[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:27.120]
And what's my head in you, darling?

[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:31.860]
He's up here, oh, he's up to come around now.

[01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:34.400]
So they're gonna let him go.

[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:36.820]
My dad knocked me over.

[01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:39.700]
He beat me very soon.

[01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:41.160]
Get it up to come around.

[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:44.160]
Tell you the one who beat it.

[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:47.860]
You'll never hear him not beat it.

[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:51.020]
My dad knocked me over.

[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:54.800]
My dad knocked me over.

[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:58.480]
My dad knocked me over.

[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:00.280]
So let me just mention this thing here,

[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:02.520]
because I'm gonna forget about it, and I don't want to do that.

[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:04.840]
Boy tossed out of current I-95,

[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:07.060]
child's mother charged with attempted murder,

[01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:10.580]
hope sound, and apparently drugged and paranoid mother

[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:13.880]
once accused of starving her newborn daughter,

[01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.240]
pulled her toddler son from his car seat

[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:17.780]
and tossed him out the window on Thursday,

[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:20.560]
as she raced along interstate I-95.

[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:21.580]
That's f***ing bitch.

[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:23.380]
She picked him up by his coveralls,

[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:26.060]
and threw him out to Florida Highway Patrol trooper, Deborah Busby,

[01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:28.240]
the screaming two and a half year old boy,

[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:30.680]
hurtled across the median as shocked motorists,

[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:31.620]
pulled over to help him.

[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:33.840]
Steven had died, lost consciousness,

[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:35.780]
only as paramedics placed him on a gurney.

[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:37.740]
The boy was in serious but stable condition

[01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:40.680]
with broken bones on Thursday night at St. Mary's Medical Center

[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:42.000]
was undergoing CAT scans,

[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:43.780]
and Barry Jackson's worried about

[01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:45.840]
if we're gonna have the Jimmy Johnson press conference.

[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:46.840]
See what I'm saying?

[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.940]
Well, I got this TV in here.

[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.380]
Thanks, Jeff Cohen, and a satellite dish.

[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:52.420]
Thanks to our friends at Digital World satellite.

[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:55.460]
Not so I could watch ESPN and find out

[01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:57.460]
if there's any big sports stories breaking.

[01:37:58.320 --> 01:37:59.940]
But so we can have CNN on here and find out

[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:01.360]
if the president's gonna get impeached.

[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:03.120]
If he's had any good blow jobs this week,

[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:04.980]
if we're gonna have a goddamn war with Iraq,

[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:06.620]
what's going on in the outside world?

[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:08.860]
Barry Jackson, I suggest you open up the window

[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:10.220]
and stick your fat ass out there,

[01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:12.020]
and find out there's other things going on in the world.

[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:14.240]
Okay, you simple, then you jackass, you...

[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:17.460]
You're just like those people that the guy was talking about.

[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:19.900]
Anyway, this little boy's mother, Chris Anjada,

[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:21.500]
30 of West Palm Beats, was charged

[01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.340]
with attempted murder and aggravated child abuse,

[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:26.720]
and was being held on $60,000 bail at the Martin County jail.

[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:30.120]
It was Hadoz's second child abuse arrest in 1991.

[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:32.240]
Hadoz pleaded guilty to child abuse charges.

[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.700]
After her infant daughter turned up malnourished

[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:37.200]
and convulsing at a hospital emergency room.

[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:39.880]
She received five years probation court document.

[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:41.280]
Showing, here's the best part.

[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:43.660]
Hadoz was going through a divorce and had won

[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:46.260]
temporary custody of her children court record show.

[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:47.600]
How do you like that?

[01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:49.620]
She was going through a divorce and won

[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:51.120]
temporary custody of her children.

[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:53.240]
Hadoz and her parent Manick depressive,

[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:54.620]
it was no longer taken her medication,

[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:56.680]
had lost a lot of weight recently.

[01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:59.340]
She'd become obsessed with the notion that a secret agency

[01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:00.660]
was trying to steal her son,

[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:02.220]
according to neighbors and friends.

[01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:05.900]
Probably the Illuminati, or the trial-ateral commission.

[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.320]
She told them she discovered the plot on the internet

[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:09.500]
and was fleeing with her child.

[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:10.840]
Oh, the plot was on the internet,

[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:13.020]
just like all those great NHL pages you see on there.

[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:15.520]
About 10.45 AM traveling north on 9.00.

[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:17.420]
And he five at speeds of up to 85 miles an hour.

[01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:19.740]
Hadoz threw the toddler out of the driver's side window

[01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:21.000]
and then skidded into a ditch.

[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:23.100]
The boy hit the ground screaming witnesses

[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:24.820]
told police and continued to cry as witnesses

[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:25.680]
raised to comfort him.

[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:27.280]
A dog ran back to her child,

[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:29.300]
ranting about pornographic movies and poor

[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:31.080]
international news coverage in local papers,

[01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:32.440]
according to witnesses and police.

[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:33.440]
Well, now, on that last part,

[01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.620]
I think she's got a point about poor international news coverage.

[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:37.560]
There was nothing in there about the Disney connection.

[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:38.280]
No.

[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:41.180]
I heard somewhere on one of the radio news.

[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:42.440]
Obviously, nothing.

[01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:43.100]
Well, it's not us.

[01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:45.760]
We wouldn't know if she was throwing out of it.

[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:49.660]
She'd rather see the kid dead than be exposed to

[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:51.300]
the pornography of Disney movies.

[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:53.040]
Oh, yeah. She probably saw priest.

[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:55.100]
Well, maybe she's smarter than we thought.

[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:57.340]
She knows that there's no fact in the church.

[01:39:57.700 --> 01:39:59.660]
She probably saw priest and got bent out of shape.

[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:01.760]
This woman, she's getting custody of her kid.

[01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:02.980]
The first one, the little girl,

[01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:04.480]
was convulsing and starving to death.

[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:05.920]
And this one, she throws out the window.

[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:08.740]
And people are worried because we're having too many abortions

[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:10.100]
because we're not making enough babies.

[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:11.700]
And the Pope is running around telling people

[01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:12.760]
they got to make a lot more babies.

[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.340]
And no, no, with that birth control.

[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:15.360]
That'd be bad.

[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:17.620]
Oh, God Almighty.

[01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:20.160]
But I bet you the right to life is not going to be screaming about this

[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:21.280]
because this kid's already alive.

[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:23.440]
See, they never care about anybody that's already alive.

[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:25.580]
It's only that fetus that they're in love with.

[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:26.820]
Here's Palm Beach. Hello.

[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:27.840]
And you know, good morning.

[01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:30.260]
I've even talked about porkers the last few days.

[01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:32.080]
You just saw a story on CNN.

[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:34.820]
A North Florida man arrested handcuffed,

[01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:38.040]
taken away for standing on the roadside with a sign that says,

[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:38.740]
speed trap ahead.

[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:41.440]
You was, now, see, this reminds me the thing about the flashing

[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:44.060]
your lights to warn the other motorist that there's a speed trap.

[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:45.140]
How can they do that?

[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:46.720]
I just thought on the other side of the line.

[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:49.940]
I guess what they say is that you're interfering with law enforcement

[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:53.420]
when you do that is the technicality of just obstruction of justice.

[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:53.960]
Oh, my God.

[01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:56.820]
Is bad is Bubba without even getting any harm job out of it.

[01:40:56.900 --> 01:40:57.440]
Have a great day.

[01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:58.900]
Here's North Miami. Hello.

[01:40:58.980 --> 01:40:59.560]
Hey, Neil.

[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:00.160]
Yes, sir.

[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.660]
Yeah, I'm reading the Miami Morning Rag here.

[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:04.820]
And Barry Jackass got a car.

[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:06.140]
Artichael, they're about you.

[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:11.160]
How this service is to these sport idiots that they're not having

[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:13.720]
the sports updates every hour on your show.

[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:14.300]
Yeah.

[01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:15.420]
I mean, police.

[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:18.520]
You know, something Barry Jackass is a little immature asshole.

[01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:21.960]
If there was anything very earth-shaking and important happening in sports,

[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:24.140]
it would fax it to us over here in the middle of the show.

[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:25.160]
And I would put it on the year.

[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:28.160]
But the fact that not only that, like Joe Sackie gets injured,

[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:30.180]
we find out we had it on the year here yesterday.

[01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:30.520]
Right.

[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:34.360]
So if there's anything earth-shaking, I mean, anybody that's that much of a

[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:37.360]
fanatic that has no life whatsoever, which is Barry Jackson, by the way.

[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:38.540]
I mean, this guy's pathetic.

[01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:40.720]
And of course, he's nothing but a shill and an asshole.

[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:44.280]
No, the thing of it is you just, there is those fanatics who listen to you.

[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:46.740]
And I think that's the dissation because I hear him yesterday,

[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:48.040]
it's sucking up the hang.

[01:41:48.540 --> 01:41:51.660]
These sports drills, I mean, it's thickening.

[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:52.440]
Get a license.

[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.760]
So don't listen to the, if you don't want to hear that.

[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:58.560]
Well, the hang is entertaining, but it's just too bad that we can get all these people.

[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:02.500]
Well, when you've got a sports station, you're going to attract a lot of those people

[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:03.760]
who this is their entire life.

[01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:07.420]
They're incapable of thinking or talking or doing about anything else in the world.

[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:10.240]
And they want to soak that up every minute of the day.

[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:11.980]
And you're right, those people are pathetic.

[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:14.040]
I've said that since the day I came on his station.

[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:15.700]
And Barry Jackson is one of them.

[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:15.900]
Yeah.

[01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:17.660]
And then he goes, because you didn't care.

[01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:18.180]
They didn't care.

[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.840]
Jimmy Johnson's, uh, uh, press conference last week, instead of interrupting you and, uh,

[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:23.140]
flopping.

[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:25.840]
No, we aren't going to be interrupting this show for the, no, I hope not.

[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:26.060]
No, I hope not.

[01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:27.780]
For his Johnson, already, anybody else is Johnson.

[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:29.880]
But here's what the free age is, the free age is.

[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:30.840]
These people just bring a towel.

[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.020]
Football season is over.

[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:36.160]
If I hear one word, talk about football, about the dog is drafting.

[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:39.160]
I mean, kind of, these people get a friggin life already.

[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:39.580]
Amen.

[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:40.220]
God.

[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:40.840]
Calm down.

[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:41.200]
Bye.

[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:41.660]
Okay.

[01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:42.540]
But he's right.

[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:45.380]
See, Barry Jackson, this is not a sports show.

[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:47.220]
I hate to paint you a picture.

[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:49.240]
I'm sure you're listening right now, your little putt whacker.

[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.760]
This isn't a sports show.

[01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:55.320]
It's the near Roger show, which is probably the best goddamn thing that ever happened to this radio station.

[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:59.840]
If I do say so myself, and the notion that we're going to be interrupting it to put Jimmy Johnson

[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.580]
out of there to go, blub, blub, blub, blub, like that.

[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:02.620]
Get a life.

[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:03.000]
Okay.

[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:03.560]
Take an interest.

[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:04.500]
Take up a hobby.

[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:06.900]
Like, uh, Russian roulette would be good.

[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:07.160]
Okay.

[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:37.140]
And then, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I

[01:43:49.360 --> 01:44:07.120]
I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I

[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:37.000]
have no respect, I have nothing but disdain for people. Hey, uh, you think you think so and so bent on Tennessee last night? Yeah, I mean, what are we talking about, betting on goddamn college ballgame? Get a life already for Christ's sake. You know, uh, one minor

[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:40.300]
request for my brother McKenzie the the Scottish bagpiper.

[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:41.180]
Have a great day back.

[01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:42.560]
So it's going to be the same.

[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:44.060]
It's going to be the same three or four things during.

[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:44.720]
That's a problem.

[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:46.020]
Just play them over and over again.

[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:48.500]
Well, that's just played for 400 times.

[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:49.660]
We can do it with spots.

[01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:50.820]
We can do it with comedy bits.

[01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:51.940]
Here's Hi, Alia.

[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:52.260]
Hello.

[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:52.840]
Hello.

[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:53.400]
Yes, sir.

[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:56.120]
You were talking about the lady who, you know,

[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.500]
the lady who threw the kid in the street.

[01:44:59.080 --> 01:44:59.280]
Right.

[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:00.920]
Well, I'm a pro lifer.

[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:05.440]
And we're, we, we care about the children, you know,

[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:06.440]
what happened to them?

[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:07.120]
Tags in the church.

[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:07.380]
OK.

[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:08.340]
Oh, yeah, that's right.

[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:09.860]
This is the facts in the church, guys.

[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:10.240]
That's right.

[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:11.540]
People's facts in the church.

[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:12.020]
OK.

[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:13.380]
When are you going to get a life, man?

[01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:14.880]
We care about our own children.

[01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:15.840]
We care about our children.

[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:17.980]
Did father or children that your boyfriend run away?

[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:18.520]
Is that what happened?

[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:19.460]
Is that why you're so psychotic?

[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:20.100]
How old school?

[01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:21.960]
Well, you're probably a father or two.

[01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:23.020]
I don't have it even known.

[01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:23.620]
OK.

[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:24.480]
It's difficult.

[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:25.340]
How was he?

[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:27.560]
There's no tags in the church.

[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:27.940]
Is he?

[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:28.600]
OK.

[01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:29.000]
There's none.

[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:30.180]
How about it?

[01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:30.860]
How about it?

[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:31.480]
How about it?

[01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:33.760]
How about it in the right to life, a little bit of any

[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:34.620]
facts in the church.

[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:36.040]
In fact, there's an article in the advocate this week

[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:38.660]
for quoting some guy from Nevada, who says that everybody

[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:39.700]
of the Vatican is a fact.

[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:40.580]
You think that he's a liar?

[01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:41.460]
He's a liar.

[01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:41.860]
OK.

[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:42.900]
He's hurting the church.

[01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:45.260]
He's probably just a fact propaganda.

[01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:46.180]
This is what I think.

[01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:47.100]
He's trying to hurt the church.

[01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:48.040]
That's what he's trying to do.

[01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:50.600]
It's like you trying to hurt the Catholic church, but it's

[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:51.020]
on your work.

[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:51.900]
I know that.

[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:53.380]
He's on your work that way.

[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.480]
Because they reproduce too fast.

[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:55.300]
I can't slow it down.

[01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:55.300]

[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.540]
And difficult to your hate to poke.

[01:45:57.960 --> 01:45:58.740]
What do you mean I hate to poke?

[01:45:58.900 --> 01:45:59.560]
I love the pope.

[01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:00.480]
I love the pope.

[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:01.060]
He's an old fact.

[01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:01.760]
He's like I am.

[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:03.160]
Yes, he is.

[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:05.480]
Only I'm a better dresser, although quite frankly.

[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:06.380]
I've never seen his dress.

[01:46:06.780 --> 01:46:08.880]
Other than that white schmata, he wears all over the place.

[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:10.520]
I understand in private he wear dresses up just

[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:11.720]
like a gay and grouper.

[01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:13.040]
You know, one of the most critical decisions

[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:14.980]
you can make is who to choose is your realtor.

[01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:16.440]
Heal Roger's God.

[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:19.900]
My religion better than yours.

[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.460]
My religion better than yours.

[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:28.180]
My religion what requires you to avoid the lens of fire.

[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:30.580]
My religion better than yours.

[01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:34.000]
My religion better than yours.

[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:37.440]
My religion better than yours.

[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:38.200]
Mm-hmm.

[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:41.200]
My religion has the taste ministry.

[01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:42.140]
And racial hate.

[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:44.440]
My religion better than yours.

[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:47.840]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:48.340]

[01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:51.300]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:55.140]
That we like the most, that I voted for.

[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:56.180]
He's wearing a dress!

[01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:58.440]
My religion's better than yours.

[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:01.380]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:05.260]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:08.360]
We have no respect for women.

[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:08.580]
We have no respect for women.

[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:09.080]
We have no respect for women.

[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:09.620]
We have no respect for women.

[01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:09.800]
We have no respect for women.

[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:10.160]
We have no respect for women.

[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:10.260]
We have no respect for women.

[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:10.840]
We have no respect for women.

[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:26.160]
We have no respect for women.

[01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:30.520]
I'm a religion standard and you're...

[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:34.120]
I'm a religion standard and you're...

[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:41.020]
We have babies and baby's and babies and babies and you're...

[01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:41.380]
Please.

[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.160]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:47.460]
It's my religion's better than yours.

[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:51.760]
We now adore the bothers you like more and more rushes.

[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:52.440]
You are new.

[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:54.860]
My religion's better than all our lives.

[01:47:55.780 --> 01:47:58.140]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:01.440]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:05.640]
We wear ties and ride our bikes and get to an area

[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:08.600]
where life's my religion's better than yours.

[01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:13.160]
My religion's better than your religion.

[01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:15.720]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:19.700]
We don't want to use our brains or mindless hands

[01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:20.600]
but we're not going to use our brains.

[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:21.060]
We're not going to use our brains or mindless hands.

[01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:22.940]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:26.720]
Let's do Miami.

[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:27.720]
Hello, Neil.

[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:28.200]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:28.780]
How are you?

[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:29.940]
Very well.

[01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:32.820]
I just wanted to take the time and see if perhaps you'd

[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:33.560]
like to give me a chance to speak.

[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:36.580]
I'm a pastor of a local church.

[01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:39.940]
I hear your program on a regular basis.

[01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:43.480]
I can't say that I'm critical of your point of view.

[01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:47.520]
The only thing that I don't understand about you is your A.T.H.

[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:51.460]
I believe you're an atheist, correct?

[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:51.900]
Yes.

[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:53.000]
God forbid.

[01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:53.680]
Okay.

[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:55.400]
Meaning that you don't believe in God whatsoever.

[01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:55.880]
Of course not.

[01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:56.620]
Okay.

[01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:58.800]
What kind of watch do you wear around your wrist?

[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:02.480]
What kind of watch do I wear around my limp wrist?

[01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:05.240]
Well, for example, Rolex watch.

[01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:06.460]
No, I don't wear a Rolex.

[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:06.800]
Okay.

[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:09.840]
Well, let's just say I take a Rolex and I put it in front of you

[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:13.480]
and I tell you that that Rolex happened by itself

[01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:15.380]
that it just created itself.

[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:18.260]
Wouldn't you say that I'm an ignorant person for thinking

[01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:19.740]
that that Rolex happened by itself?

[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:20.620]
Sir, you know something?

[01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:21.580]
I wouldn't give a crap.

[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:23.380]
You're not...

[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:25.100]
You don't worry about how this planet came in.

[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:28.260]
You know, I absolutely do not because I know that we don't know the answers.

[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:30.920]
We don't even know answers to things that happened a few years ago

[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:31.780]
or a few months ago.

[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:34.900]
We don't even know if Monica Lewinsky was even given blow jobs to the president

[01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:37.120]
and you're trying to give me to believe a bunch of bobbin miceys

[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:39.280]
that were written by primitive people thousands of years ago.

[01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:43.440]
See, if I did care about those questions, see long time ago I said to myself,

[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:45.520]
we don't know and we're never going to know.

[01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:46.980]
And that's the end of it.

[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.340]
I'm not going to waste my life listening to a bunch of fairy tales

[01:49:49.340 --> 01:49:51.640]
that are being spread by other people for a purpose,

[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:53.660]
for like taking over your mind and your money.

[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:55.280]
What happens when we die then?

[01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:56.240]
You go right into the ground.

[01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:58.400]
Just like phyto goes into the ground.

[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:00.120]
Just like the cockroach goes into the ground.

[01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:01.920]
You go a dust to dust and so on.

[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:02.840]
That's it.

[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:06.080]
I mean, are you really afraid of death?

[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:09.060]
It's not a matter of being afraid of death because...

[01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:09.460]
Sure it is.

[01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:11.600]
Listen, religion is about two things.

[01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:12.880]
Fear of death and money.

[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:14.800]
That's the only thing they really know about.

[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:16.320]
You know what? You are absolutely right.

[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:18.560]
Religion. You don't need religion.

[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:20.520]
What you need is a relationship with God.

[01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:21.840]
No, God.

[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:23.920]
There is no such thing as God is religion.

[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:25.900]
You have to get away from that word.

[01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:28.260]
Well, I'm not going to play some medical games with you.

[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:29.080]
There is no God.

[01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:31.780]
If you believe in a God that the Jews invented or the Goa invented

[01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:32.440]
or the...

[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:33.080]
Okay, go ahead.

[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:36.220]
There's been thousands of God through the years.

[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:38.220]
Every culture has invented their own God.

[01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:39.640]
The Aztecs with the Sun God.

[01:50:39.980 --> 01:50:40.800]
Everybody had God.

[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:41.500]
You know something?

[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:43.060]
It's all just a bunch of double talk.

[01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:43.480]
That's all.

[01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:46.140]
But if it helps you to hang on to that,

[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:47.780]
I don't want to deny you that.

[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:49.640]
But I'm certainly not going to be dying an opinion

[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:51.740]
to express the right to express it in the opinion.

[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:51.840]
No, I appreciate that.

[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:53.580]
I respect your opinion.

[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:55.560]
And I, like I say, I hear your program

[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:57.620]
and I am critical of your point of views.

[01:50:58.060 --> 01:50:59.940]
But now there are certain explanations that are logical.

[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:01.180]
So then there are only two things.

[01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:02.400]
Either evolution or...

[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:03.800]
Sir, I want to ask you this question.

[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:04.120]
Okay.

[01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:06.520]
This lady that threw her kid out of the car yesterday.

[01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:06.940]
All right.

[01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:08.080]
Are you listening to me?

[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:08.800]
Yes, I am, sir.

[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:11.340]
I thought I'm who's saying is making chemical biological weapons

[01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:12.960]
over in Iraq, right?

[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.100]
Are you listening to me?

[01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:14.480]
Yes, I am.

[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:14.960]
Okay.

[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:17.380]
We have El Nino, which is causing flooding

[01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:18.880]
and all these grotesque things happening

[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:20.000]
and people dying, right?

[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:20.420]
Right.

[01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:22.040]
Now if God is omnipotent,

[01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:23.500]
how come all of this is going on?

[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:24.580]
There's awful Satan.

[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:26.480]
Ah, Satan, where did he come from?

[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:27.240]
Who invented him?

[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:30.000]
Who invented him?

[01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:31.000]
What's Arju, sir?

[01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:33.080]
Who invented Satan?

[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:34.100]
Who created him?

[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:35.180]
Well, Satan...

[01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:36.300]
Sir, who...

[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:36.960]
I'm an answer to you.

[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:38.160]
Who let me answer you?

[01:51:38.180 --> 01:51:38.580]
I'm listening.

[01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:41.140]
God created him a perfect angel.

[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:41.720]
Yeah.

[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:42.900]
So here we go again.

[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.400]
He created him as a perfect angel.

[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:45.440]
Obviously not.

[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:46.160]
I thought that was...

[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:47.320]
I thought that was J.T. snow

[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:48.360]
and then they created him as a giant.

[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:49.300]
He was a perfect angel.

[01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:50.440]
Well, how do you explain...

[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:53.360]
See, if something is perfect by definition,

[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:54.380]
it's just like God.

[01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:55.860]
He's omnipotent and he's perfect.

[01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:57.460]
But he keeps screwing up all the time.

[01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:59.440]
And we have leprosy and we have cancer

[01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:00.680]
and we have bubonic plague.

[01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:01.700]
And we have AIDS.

[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:03.180]
And we have all of these other diseases.

[01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:05.560]
We got this new disease that we're talking about.

[01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:06.580]
Every time you turn around,

[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:08.580]
there's another new disease that affects the brain

[01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:09.640]
and eats the brain away.

[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:12.300]
Every time you turn around, there's another new disease.

[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:13.760]
And it's Satan.

[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:15.300]
See, that's a convenient excuse.

[01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:17.640]
That's for morons to say stuff like that.

[01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:18.700]
God is great.

[01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:19.420]
But Satan.

[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:20.540]
See, if Satan...

[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:21.920]
If God is omnipotent,

[01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:23.300]
all he's got to do is get rid of Satan.

[01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:23.860]
That's all.

[01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:24.840]
Hey, you're gone.

[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:25.480]
Like that.

[01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:27.360]
Like he snapped his fingers and he created the universe.

[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:28.620]
He also snaps his fingers.

[01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:29.560]
Satan is gone.

[01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:31.120]
Let's have peace and tranquility.

[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:32.860]
You live 300 years of peace.

[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:34.220]
We don't have all of these problems.

[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:35.020]
We don't have wars.

[01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:35.840]
Man is perfect.

[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:37.180]
Doesn't have free choice.

[01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:39.200]
But then there won't be anyone to test us.

[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:39.820]
Oh, yeah.

[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:40.520]
We have to be tested.

[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:41.820]
Like Abraham, go kill your kids.

[01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:42.840]
I was just kidding.

[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:43.160]
Psych.

[01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:45.640]
Yeah, just testing you.

[01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:47.680]
Just checking out to see what kind of a good you,

[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:48.460]
you really were Abraham.

[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:50.280]
And by the way, I won't get any circumcised.

[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:51.620]
Who you can...

[01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:52.000]
Ischmendrick.

[01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:53.060]
Yeah, Ischmile.

[01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:54.180]
Ischmendrick.

[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:55.580]
Ischmendrick with circumcised.

[01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:55.940]
Okay?

[01:52:56.420 --> 01:52:56.780]
Ischmile.

[01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:57.920]
All of these...

[01:52:57.920 --> 01:52:59.460]
These bubble mice, he's my god.

[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:00.040]
It just...

[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:01.160]
It boggles my mind.

[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:03.280]
But you know something, I'd only still a lot of time thinking about it,

[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:04.500]
because I realize, especially,

[01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:06.980]
the one good thing that's happened to me doing this kind of work,

[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:07.860]
and doing this show every day,

[01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:10.080]
is I realize how weak most people are.

[01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:11.460]
Most people are such sheep.

[01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:13.040]
Like these people we have sitting on hold,

[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:15.040]
and somebody says something while they're on hold,

[01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:15.860]
and that they can hear,

[01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:17.060]
and then we punch them up on here,

[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:18.800]
and they repeat it like a goddamn parrot,

[01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:19.960]
like a minor bird.

[01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:21.860]
Because their minds are so weak,

[01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:24.480]
they don't have an original thought in their brain if you could find it.

[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:25.760]
But thank you for your call, sir.

[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:28.760]
All these religious notes, they're afraid of saying three little words,

[01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:29.680]
and make it very easy.

[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:31.380]
And then when you start asking all of these questions,

[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:32.780]
for which we don't have any answers,

[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:33.700]
all you have to do is say,

[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:34.260]
I don't know.

[01:53:34.420 --> 01:53:34.880]
There you go.

[01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:36.540]
And people can't say that.

[01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:37.760]
I never have been able to say that.

[01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:39.540]
So since the beginning recorded time,

[01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:41.460]
everybody says, oh, well, how did we get here?

[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:42.680]
And then, okay, we don't really know,

[01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:43.600]
but we'll make up an answer.

[01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:44.940]
Instead of just saying,

[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:46.420]
I don't have any freaking idea.

[01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:47.620]
Let's make up an answer.

[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:48.800]
Let's make up some fairy tales.

[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:49.720]
Sounds reasonable to me.

[01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:50.880]
And you know something?

[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:52.120]
They could have done a better job.

[01:53:52.340 --> 01:53:52.920]
And they could have made up some,

[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:56.020]
I mean, like the Virgin Mary on the side of a bank building in Pensacola,

[01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.200]
where they're going to, I mean, come on.

[01:53:57.340 --> 01:53:58.720]
Well, other cultures did do a better job.

[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:01.720]
The Virgin Mary on a totina pizza at what's your name's house?

[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:03.100]
Rosie, uh, uh,

[01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:04.940]
Rosie Riccardo, whatever her name is,

[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:05.480]
in Hollywood.

[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:07.200]
Oh, Rosie Lopez.

[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:08.200]
I forgot all about her.

[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:08.860]
She's small potatoes.

[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:10.220]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:10.600]
Hello.

[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:11.080]
Hello.

[01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:11.940]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:12.640]
Hi, you knew.

[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:14.660]
I just wanted to say I'm really enjoying your show today,

[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:15.700]
but I had a comment to make.

[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:16.140]
Okay.

[01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:19.440]
Is it true that a homosexuals aren't supposed to believe in God?

[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:20.560]
What the hell is that mean?

[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:21.700]
I'm just asking you.

[01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:22.760]
Is that the reason why you don't believe in God?

[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:25.020]
No, it has nothing to do with anybody's sexual orientation

[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:25.940]
or anything like that.

[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:28.260]
It has to do with not believing in fairy tales.

[01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:29.300]
See, here's the...

[01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:30.600]
You don't consider it a fairy tale.

[01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:32.520]
Here, that's why I said fairy tale.

[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:34.280]
Here's another example of a caller,

[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:36.840]
just like the other of the Julio that called before with his name.

[01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:37.740]
Oh, yeah, sure, sure.

[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:38.540]
Same thing.

[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:39.140]
Same thing.

[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:41.100]
I really enjoy your show, but...

[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:42.180]
And now you want to take a little shot.

[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:45.120]
Yeah, well, all you're promoting is negativity on the other hand when God promotes...

[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:46.040]
No, let me ask you this.

[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:47.680]
Why do you listen to the show then?

[01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:49.760]
Because you took me off.

[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:52.240]
I usually listen to the show, but you know, this time...

[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:52.680]
Because it...

[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:53.200]
Because it was?

[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:54.800]
But this time, you know, you really...

[01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:55.740]
No, let me ask you this.

[01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:56.420]
Why do you listen to the show?

[01:54:56.420 --> 01:54:57.300]
I'm not even as negativity.

[01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:59.080]
Yeah, you'll okay, then go find something positive.

[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:00.720]
Go find yourself a good vibrator.

[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:01.080]
That's real.

[01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:02.400]
And make sure it's on positive.

[01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:03.700]
See, this...

[01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:05.340]
You're not fooling anybody, sweetheart.

[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:07.200]
You're not fooling anybody for a second.

[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:12.560]
And if somebody says something that makes sense and challenges all this garbage that's in your brain that you can't get rid of,

[01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:13.600]
then right away you have to...

[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:14.720]
Oh, it's because you're a faggot.

[01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:15.720]
It's because you're this.

[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:17.640]
It's because you're bald and old and you're Jewish.

[01:55:17.900 --> 01:55:18.700]
Whatever it is.

[01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:20.380]
And she just can't handle it.

[01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:21.240]
She can't deal with it.

[01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:26.740]
Well, sweetheart, if you want to believe that there are the little green men on Mars and on the moon and on the cockamone,

[01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:30.580]
whatever you want, it's a pre-country, go right ahead and just be a bozo the rest of your life.

[01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:31.300]
Because that's what...

[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:32.500]
Nothing negative about reality.

[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:35.420]
Well, it's pretty ugly, but nevertheless, if you can cope with it,

[01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:37.260]
unless you are weakling in which case you need religion.

[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:38.320]
And obviously you do.

[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:40.340]
Besides, there are a lot of self-hating religious facts.

[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:42.120]
Oh, there are a question about that.

[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:47.960]
That's why the Catholics have that dignity thing so that they can go there and pretend that the church loves them and so on.

[01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:50.320]
Even though the church, of course, the Catholic Church is just low...

[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:51.880]
There's nothing but fags in the church.

[01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:54.280]
Just read anything you want about the Vatican.

[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:55.660]
There's no fags in the church.

[01:55:55.780 --> 01:55:57.440]
Like I said, make no mistake about it.

[01:55:57.780 --> 01:56:00.100]
You show me a guy in a dress and I'll show you a faggot.

[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:01.540]
Or a guy who likes to dress up.

[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:02.400]
Or both.

[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:04.480]
Wonder if Johnny Bench likes to dress up.

[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:07.980]
This is 560 QAM.

[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:12.980]
Neil God, out, WQAM.

[01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:16.140]
Where the faggot is.

[01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:20.880]
Here's Kendall.

[01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:21.360]
Hello.

[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:22.460]
Yes, sir.

[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:23.060]
Mr. Rick here.

[01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:24.060]
How you doing, Neil?

[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:24.500]
Okay.

[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:28.680]
Listen, I know everybody looks up to you all the other Hawkshow toast.

[01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:29.780]
But I don't get it.

[01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:30.240]
Hawkshow toast?

[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:31.100]
I don't get it.

[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:32.200]
You know, don't take this wrong.

[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:35.880]
But how can you, you know, mix sports with real topics?

[01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:37.200]
You ought to just stick to sports.

[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:39.040]
Sir, let me say it again.

[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:40.180]
This is the Neil Rogers Show.

[01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:41.140]
It's not a sports show.

[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.960]
Yeah, but the bodily function jokes.

[01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:44.860]
Who are you feeling to?

[01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:45.820]
Nine-year-old boys?

[01:56:46.180 --> 01:56:46.760]
What's the deal?

[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:47.800]
Nine-year-old girls, yeah.

[01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:48.980]
What's the deal, then?

[01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:51.040]
In any other words, you're listening, but you don't like the shows.

[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:52.140]
That would just tell me again, sir.

[01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:53.060]
You're nothing.

[01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:54.980]
Have you ever listened to any of your other...

[01:56:54.980 --> 01:56:57.860]
You're another one of these people who's calling to tell me how to do the show.

[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:01.200]
But for some reason, which you refuse to explain, you're listening to it.

[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:02.120]
Why are you...

[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:03.700]
You're a garbage.

[01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:03.920]
You're a garbage.

[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:04.240]
Well, good.

[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:05.540]
Then go play some sports.

[01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:05.880]
Okay?

[01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:07.520]
Go play pocket pool and get out of our face.

[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:08.280]
Another one.

[01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:12.100]
Another definitive QAM asshole.

[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:13.960]
But thank you very much for listening to this show.

[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:18.180]
I sit and I listen to the assholes that call it on the sports shows on this radio station.

[01:57:18.340 --> 01:57:21.520]
And I wonder to myself, what kind of morons are these people?

[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:24.300]
Or what about the Bobby Schmendrick on the Vikings?

[01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:27.520]
Who cares about Bobby Schmendrick and the Vikings for Christ's sake?

[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:28.940]
It's the 24th of February.

[01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:29.800]
Who gives a crowd?

[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:32.620]
And even it was the middle of August to what give a crowd.

[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:34.760]
So I'm not mixing anything with anything.

[01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:35.480]
Let me say it again.

[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:36.520]
It's the Neo Rodgers show.

[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:39.700]
And if you don't like it, go find someplace else to sit your fat ass.

[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:40.040]
Okay?

[01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:40.980]
Pathetic.

[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:43.320]
We got all these instant program directors out there.

[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:44.460]
Why not come over here, pal?

[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:45.040]
You'll get hired.

[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:47.380]
Because you know nothing about the business, obviously.

[01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:49.980]
Which is the main qualification for getting hired and programming here.

[01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:51.180]
Here's Boca.

[01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:51.560]
Hello.

[01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:52.940]
Neo, how you doing?

[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:53.280]
Great.

[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:55.800]
When you go to the movies, you know, like a movie's what do you do?

[01:57:56.100 --> 01:57:56.420]
You leave.

[01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:58.480]
So for the last car, if you don't like the show.

[01:57:58.480 --> 01:57:58.980]
Yeah.

[01:57:58.980 --> 01:58:00.020]
You need to tell them.

[01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:01.840]
But they don't understand they never do it.

[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:06.140]
I've got 50 billion people out there who are closet listeners who pretend that they hate

[01:58:06.140 --> 01:58:06.560]
the show.

[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:07.360]
They hate me.

[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:08.120]
It's disgusting.

[01:58:08.420 --> 01:58:09.020]
It's juvenile.

[01:58:09.300 --> 01:58:09.960]
It's whatever it is.

[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:10.700]
And they're listening.

[01:58:11.060 --> 01:58:13.720]
There's a guy that's almost an hour into the show and he still is.

[01:58:14.220 --> 01:58:17.700]
You know, one thing about this professor who commented about Miami.

[01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:22.080]
And you know, Miami is pretty much like you said in armpit.

[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:24.540]
It's a fact that the Annery Republicans in Toilet is a joke.

[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:25.520]
You know what I know?

[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:26.320]
It annoys people.

[01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:31.200]
Neo, you have Channel 6, an report on a student in Iraq that speaks English.

[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:32.440]
You're studying to be a doctor.

[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:34.000]
Are you going to start with this again, sir?

[01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:36.880]
Are you going to hack me a China with this bilingual stuff again, sir?

[01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:37.980]
I got people coming on the phone.

[01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:39.200]
Oh, get out of here.

[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:40.060]
Take a leak.

[01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:41.060]
God.

[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:42.260]
Can you believe this?

[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:44.440]
People that start that crap with me.

[01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:45.960]
He's like the other guy.

[01:58:46.140 --> 01:58:48.520]
Because you know, you're not going to be on here more than like two seconds.

[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:51.240]
Once you start that crap, you paroch your little twerp.

[01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:53.180]
He saw a guy in Iraq, spigging English.

[01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:54.340]
Well, let me tell you something.

[01:58:54.600 --> 01:58:58.840]
You go over to Baghdad and either stay there or try functioning in English and Baghdad.

[01:58:58.980 --> 01:58:59.180]
Okay?

[01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:04.120]
I go to Rome eight million times a year, which is a hell of a lot more civilized and educated

[01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:05.680]
than Baghdad will ever be.

[01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:10.160]
And there are aside from people who came from this country or some very educated people who

[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:11.160]
work in the service business.

[01:59:11.420 --> 01:59:12.800]
Nobody speak in English over there.

[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:14.380]
No, what I expect them to.

[01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:20.220]
But what the hell difference does it make you function based on like living in whatever the conditions are around you?

[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:23.480]
And these people are going to keep banging away and banging away and banging away.

[01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:26.620]
I've said to them, they're living and breathing Hispanics in this town.

[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:29.260]
All speaking English made me so better than this guy does.

[01:59:30.020 --> 01:59:34.860]
And he wants to waste his time with these or far sitting in Domino Park who refused to speak English.

[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:36.860]
I have no room in my life for those people.

[01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:41.140]
Those are the very same people that are threatening everybody and this professor from FIU.

[01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:45.540]
Because he expressed the opinion that they don't like because they don't understand what freedom of speech is all about.

[01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:47.700]
They've been here for 40 years almost now.

[01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:51.760]
And they still don't understand anything about this government and they never will until they croak.

[01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:53.280]
And they're very embarrassing for the rest of us.

[01:59:53.380 --> 01:59:54.060]
Well, there you go.

[01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:56.940]
But this guy wants call Sandy Payton, okay, sir.

[01:59:57.140 --> 01:59:59.720]
Maybe you can find her skinny ass somewhere on her radio dial.

[02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:02.460]
Call her up and she'll talk about it for next 55 hours.

[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:03.240]
Non stop.

[02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:04.700]
It's boring.

[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:07.900]
He's he's he's worse than the guys that call the sports shows.

[02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:10.940]
And believe me, they're terminal 90% of those colors.

[02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:12.360]
I wouldn't give you a nickel floor.

[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:13.440]
They're pathetic.

[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:15.800]
I mean, you talk about narrow casting.

[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:21.520]
They're talking about stuff that appeals to such a minuscule number of people who cares about that crap.

[02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:29.620]
About some 15 year old kid that's playing high school volleyball in peorian Illinois somewhere who's got a really big left foot or whatever the hell he's got.

[02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:31.940]
God, here's Miami Springs.

[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:32.320]
Hello.

[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:32.880]
Hello.

[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:33.420]
Yes, sir.

[02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:34.960]
Yeah, Neil. Good morning.

[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:38.340]
I don't I don't always agree with everything you say, but you know, many times.

[02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:40.540]
Well, because each one of us are different.

[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:41.780]
That's right. Very good. Excellent.

[02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:43.820]
And I don't expect a bunch of lemmings out there.

[02:00:43.940 --> 02:00:44.500]
No, exactly.

[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:46.420]
Respective nature. Really thoughtful of people.

[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:48.540]
Yeah, well, yeah, I'm glad.

[02:00:48.860 --> 02:00:51.660]
You know, you you've cut my chain of thought, but it's fine.

[02:00:52.340 --> 02:00:53.160]
That's the up.

[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:58.440]
Yeah, as far as the fishwoods concerned, all we have to remember is bokeh burgers.

[02:00:59.000 --> 02:00:59.160]
Right.

[02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:00.120]
Same thing happened.

[02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:01.760]
Yeah, they were all bites.

[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:03.540]
Well, Dr. Atkins died.

[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:04.420]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:05.780]
What's things that you believe in?

[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:07.700]
And I think that's a car, baby.

[02:01:07.820 --> 02:01:08.940]
That's what they show is all about.

[02:01:08.940 --> 02:01:12.120]
It's got the power not just sitting here in flap in my gums for four hours,

[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:14.640]
but actually being able to motivate people having some credibility.

[02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:16.160]
That's what they show is all about.

[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:18.880]
Anybody can sit here and read ball scores for four hours.

[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:23.400]
Yeah, but changing the gears a bit, because what spurred me to call is when I switched it on,

[02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:25.620]
and I heard you talking about the professor.

[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:29.100]
Actually, he's very, he's what we have to admire.

[02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:32.180]
You know, someone who's concerned more about the substance.

[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:37.600]
The style comes afterwards, but we have a group of people who are more interested in appearances.

[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:40.840]
And all they care about is appearances, and that's what's important.

[02:01:41.020 --> 02:01:41.580]
And it's not.

[02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:44.840]
What's important is, is doing the right thing.

[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:50.880]
And then that by itself, you're going to have the, you're going to have the appearances come back later.

[02:01:51.420 --> 02:01:55.140]
It's there's no purpose to have a bunch of crook here in Miami-Dade.

[02:01:55.580 --> 02:02:00.580]
The fact that these old Cubans down there in Miami are defending Xavier Suarez,

[02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:04.800]
and what goes on politically in the city of Miami, is so incomprehensible,

[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:07.600]
it shows you how intractable and hopeless they are.

[02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:11.040]
And that's why we should just forget about them, and just sit them all in Domino Park,

[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:14.160]
and let them just eat their, drink their cafe, Kubanoa,

[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:17.380]
until they're, their intestines rot, and just get them out of here already.

[02:02:17.460 --> 02:02:20.620]
Well, most of them are dying off, and then we're trying to see the new generation.

[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:20.940]
Right.

[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:26.420]
And in regards to, you know, because you have people talking about bilingualism.

[02:02:26.940 --> 02:02:31.260]
But really, I hate to sound feel good, but when makes this country great,

[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:35.480]
and why this country could take a leadership role around the world,

[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:44.080]
is essentially, you name the group, and there's a significant group of those people here that live here.

[02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:48.180]
You know, it doesn't matter whether it's from Pakistan or from Cuba,

[02:02:48.740 --> 02:02:56.440]
or from Iran, or from Iraq, they could be from anywhere, and you will find that nationality melting in here.

[02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:59.460]
And that's what makes this country what it is. A lot of people.

[02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:07.960]
Well, a mess, yes, but also have a little bit of the moral responsibility to be able to intervene,

[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:10.140]
and say, well, you know, we understand.

[02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:19.340]
You know, in the long run, I think it's a lot better that way than to try to consider this country something homogeneous.

[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:22.940]
Well, let's, this guy wants everybody to be just like him.

[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:26.080]
No, no, in diversity, there's strength.

[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:31.100]
Okay, all right. Well said, have a great day, pal, even though it's not working here, but we're trying it.

[02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:35.040]
Works in other places, like I was talking on the table about Toronto yesterday heard that,

[02:03:35.220 --> 02:03:39.080]
where they have tremendous diversity, and people get along, and nobody's talking to China about bilingualism,

[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:41.160]
then you go over to Montreal and Quebec.

[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:44.660]
There's another example of what happens when they start with this bilingual crap.

[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:47.280]
Two cities, not that far apart, same country.

[02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:49.320]
One of them works magnificently well.

[02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:52.520]
Great city, other one, a zoo, a circus.

[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:54.940]
People are fleeing from there because of the frogs.

[02:03:55.420 --> 02:03:59.820]
This story of that they, I got two fags on this from Bartos, which I thought was mildly amusing,

[02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:05.800]
but now that I read into it, this guy named Johnny Larmor, he said beside US 98 holding a speed trap ahead sign,

[02:04:06.340 --> 02:04:10.340]
passing motorists, talked their thanks, smiled and waved, but the deputies were not pleased.

[02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:15.720]
The deputies, those working at what police call a traffic speed enforcement area gave them a parking ticket handcuffed

[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:19.420]
and took him to a mental health crisis center and confiscated a sign.

[02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:22.660]
A cheap homemade sign, the deputies said it was evidence.

[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:29.540]
Polk Sheriff's Colonel, Grady Judd, agreed with Larmor and said, Larmor 48 is welcome to a sign back.

[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:35.340]
Hindsight is perfect, said the Colonel, but what we should have done is pull up stakes and move on down the road.

[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:39.840]
Mr. Larmor was doing our job for us, which was to slow down people to the speed limit.

[02:04:40.100 --> 02:04:41.780]
See, that's where the whole thing comes in.

[02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:44.060]
Are you really there to get people to slow down?

[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:46.920]
Are you just there to write tickets? That's the real question.

[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:53.360]
Now does anybody believe that these speed traps are set up to slow us down to make us be good, obedient, right?

[02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:56.160]
They're there to write tickets is what they are.

[02:04:56.760 --> 02:05:01.260]
And so they were forced to unhand cuff them and unreleased his sign and sent him on his Murrayway.

[02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:05.300]
After they handled this poor guy, who was just because it was a road out in the middle of nowhere.

[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.700]
And he thought it was like pretty ridiculous that they were sent up a speed trap out in the middle of nowhere,

[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:12.380]
like on how you this road with a speed limit is like two miles an hour.

[02:05:12.380 --> 02:05:17.980]
And I'm going to say it again, you people out there that are too stupid to realize when the porkers are out there in heat.

[02:05:18.580 --> 02:05:20.920]
And there are speed traps every five yards.

[02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:28.020]
If you don't want to slow down and just go around that WL line and get yourself a double ticket for speeding and for going on the other side of a WL line,

[02:05:28.040 --> 02:05:29.720]
hey, this road you idiots you.

[02:05:30.380 --> 02:05:38.440]
I'll never forget as long as I live that Jack has on Friday and his little girl in the back seat pulls around me, passes me on the wrong side of the WL line.

[02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:45.900]
And she turns around and gives me a look that would kill ugly little bitch because I'm not going fast enough to suit their fancy in my beautiful Corvette.

[02:05:45.980 --> 02:05:50.580]
Well, too damn bad. Okay. I hope you want to get an 8,000 speeding tickets. You Jack asked.

[02:05:50.860 --> 02:05:53.400]
Probably was a kidnapping. Here's point and beach. Hello.

[02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:55.440]
Neil. Yes, sir.

[02:05:55.480 --> 02:05:57.460]
Hey, dude. I'm trying to call you for quite some time.

[02:05:57.840 --> 02:06:01.700]
I just need to educate your audience a little bit. I'm a police officer up here in Palm Beach County.

[02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:08.420]
And you guys got it wrong. There's no quotas. Traffic is very, very, very small percentage of what we do on a daily basis.

[02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:08.960]
Yeah.

[02:06:09.340 --> 02:06:14.640]
And the reason why we target certain streets is because we have a lot of old people and influential people that run the city.

[02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:21.820]
They want us there to slow people down. But you're right. A lot of times when people hide, I disagree with that theory as far as traffic control.

[02:06:22.040 --> 02:06:25.360]
If you want to slow people down, you should right out the middle of the road with the light on.

[02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:31.000]
But the people I'm talking about, like in Plantation, they really don't want to slow people down. They just want to write business.

[02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:35.500]
Well, if they wanted to slow people down, they'd be sitting out there and high-atiss 24 hours a day.

[02:06:35.500 --> 02:06:39.580]
And these people that are tailgating and trying to force you to go like 20 miles over the speed limit.

[02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:42.440]
Those would be the people getting the tickets and they're getting on my nerves.

[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:47.180]
Well, they do. But the city's got a very small percentage of the revenue if we take it well.

[02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:49.720]
Yeah. You know, you hear these people talking about it.

[02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:53.920]
Then how come all the people that are driving all the bad vehicles out there with the ball tires and no brakes?

[02:06:54.220 --> 02:06:59.960]
How come those people really get stopped? How about the old people that drive in 20 miles under the speed limit and the left handling?

[02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:02.900]
How come somebody doesn't pull them over? I've never heard of this.

[02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:09.020]
I've never seen anybody that was driving slow and irresponsibly get pulled over. Never.

[02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:10.440]
That is a statute, actually.

[02:07:10.660 --> 02:07:13.220]
Well, yeah, of course it is. Well, why aren't they aren't they getting pulled over?

[02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:17.320]
I can't speak for all the other officers. But I mean, speeding is the rare thing that I stop people from.

[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:21.240]
I'd rather stop someone for a spy registration or a bad vehicle, whatever you want to say.

[02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:24.020]
Right. But still, traffic is a very small percentage of what we do.

[02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:30.080]
And very large majority officers get out and they really bust the rest and make the city safe and so on and so forth.

[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:34.200]
People rarely respect our depression anymore and I thought I'd call and give you another time.

[02:07:34.220 --> 02:07:39.100]
Well, because most of the cops we hear are from like that arrogant Jack Asda called me, which you go Friday,

[02:07:39.580 --> 02:07:44.340]
that was given the lecture and given everybody else a lecture and it just was obnoxious.

[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:47.340]
That's all. Tell us that we want to make up the laws as we go along.

[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.860]
Well, I can't speak for everybody, but I just speak for myself.

[02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:52.440]
Well, thank God for you, sir. Have a great day.

[02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:56.400]
There's a real cop with a real reasonable attitude.

[02:07:56.780 --> 02:08:00.400]
And like I've said before, there may be 20, 30% of the cops that got that added to them.

[02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:05.980]
Then there's about 30 or 40% in between. We're going to kind of jaded because police worked in turn out to be what they thought it was going to be.

[02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:10.880]
And then there's 20 or 30% on the other end who are just a bunch of assholes who are just out there to hassle the public.

[02:08:11.120 --> 02:08:13.440]
Your hair is too long. You're too young. We don't like the way you look.

[02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:17.520]
Whatever the hell it is, you're too dark. You're too light. So to speak.

[02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:20.980]
Never before is a cellular carrier offered you what I'm about to tell you right now.

[02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:57.020]
Take their possessions away. And then you burn it down.

[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:06.000]
You can get somebody to believe anything you hate. If I will say it's true.

[02:09:07.220 --> 02:09:12.980]
No matter what you do, you can be ill-wrapped. The Lord will always forgive you.

[02:09:12.980 --> 02:09:21.760]
You think up the poison in your snake. Wave it all around. Find the fortune's limit.

[02:09:23.420 --> 02:09:28.100]
And you to Dr. Down. Everybody, clean up all the things.

[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:35.920]
Okay? Come on, you just need public.

[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:47.240]
We said, grab that as your kid. You're too the right to be down.

[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:54.500]
You're all the kids running. And that's the later out.

[02:09:54.500 --> 02:10:04.920]
I don't want you to get sick. You make a sacrifice. You got the hinders and bounds.

[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.760]
We got this grotesque story which this newspaper, this I'm going to, I think I may have to get the herald again.

[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:15.740]
This son sent, well, seriously, I'm looking forward because they headed on the CDS evening news last night.

[02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:21.920]
In fact, Dan Rather had a really sour push and they showed Al Presidente on there who said very briefly, outrageous.

[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:28.360]
He said there is no excuse for this. And they showed him saying that. That's all he said. And of course, in his case, lately, the less said the better anyway.

[02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:39.520]
But at any rate, the story being US students lag in math and science. American high school seniors scored below students from most other countries in an international test of math and science,

[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:44.480]
according to test release, a really a results released on Tuesday. And this doesn't include Asia, by the way.

[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:51.420]
Now, Asians, as you know, like Japs and other groups to the Chinks, they're always like way up there on top, but they were not part of the survey.

[02:10:52.020 --> 02:11:00.700]
In spite of that, we came in 19th out of 21. The only countries we beat out were Cyprus and South Africa. How do you like that?

[02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:11.480]
Even those, now listen to this, even those Americans who took tough physics and advanced math courses performed worse than most students taking equally rigorous courses elsewhere.

[02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:21.580]
According to the Turnt International Mathematics and Science study, although students from 21 countries took the test of general math and science, now it's toward the end of 1994 or 4 or 95 school year.

[02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:35.600]
American scored below the international average 19th out of 21. And I wish I had the entire list of all it was like all the European countries in Canada and like generally any place you can think of, except Cyprus and South Africa.

[02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:43.920]
Oh my God. But I guarantee every one of those students could tell you who Michael Jordan is and Mike Tyson. This ties him with what I was saying yesterday.

[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:57.080]
There's nothing wrong with knowing who those people are, but it's a disproportionate set of values in this country. And that is that being intelligent, being anything other than just stupid and just going along with a crowd and being a moron, that's what it's all about in America.

[02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:16.080]
That's exactly and the positively what American society is all about. Just like there are people stupid enough to believe that this asshole from the UN is telling us I saw the clip. I didn't see the one you're talking about that got you infuriated by I saw the one last night again this morning where he says we can do business with Saddam Hussein.

[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:40.860]
That's like, it sounds like Neville Chamberlain all over again to me. We can do business with Adolf. He makes great the meat seasoning to make your meat real tender. That's what it sounds like to me. And in Newsweek, I just got the newsweek yesterday and it shows the all of the missiles. You know, because obviously his blood sugar is like 800 at this point out of control.

[02:12:41.280 --> 02:13:01.340]
I did go to public last night since that guy was nice enough to call in yesterday and did get a pint of fish food and very surreptitiously sneak in and out got about four or five items was out of there without being identified sneak back into the house put my fish food open. You see open a little bit so it doesn't burst in your microwave. Of course, a little air out like just to like that. Just a little crack.

[02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:14.580]
And then you pop that baby in a microwave for 35 37 seconds and then by the time you got you know ready to sit down, you got your soda there to wash it down. You come back and it's all ready to go and it's tempered to a nice soft consistency.

[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:30.120]
And you stick your spoon in there and the first spoonful of course is going to have not only that real thick chocolate marshmallow real real super rich stuff in it, but it's also guaranteed going to have some of those little tiny super dark chunks of chocolate in the shapes of little fish.

[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:42.660]
So you can have a great smile on your person become born again at the same time as your popping that in your post speaking of board again by the way did bring in my Charles temple and book for well to God, which evidently we must have somebody listening out there this time.

[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:50.460]
Because evidently we got a lot more response on that just for my talking about it on the tape from all the old I would be tape on Monday that we did back when I was talking about it live.

[02:13:51.100 --> 02:14:02.280]
Everybody that brother wants this guy damn book and unfortunately it's a Canadian book and I'll give the number I'll put that I don't know if you're going to have any success because it may actually be banned in this country because it's so honest there's nothing all that controversial about it.

[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:09.460]
Of the fact that he says religions about your crap and he used to be a minister and used to be Billy Graham's best friend and talks about what a foamy he is which we all know.

[02:14:10.060 --> 02:14:14.500]
But I do have a thing I'm going to read from there a little while because I figured in fact maybe I'll just read the whole book on here.

[02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:22.880]
I'll just do it like not like Mark Scheinbaum. I'll just do it a few sentences at a time and suppose to put everybody into a coma in my usual sneaky way of getting that stuff out.

[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:30.640]
Here's my me lake. Hello. Yeah, no, my friend. Yes, sir. Yeah, I've had all along. I'm sorry to say it's not like the spot.

[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:36.360]
The real downfall of the society has to fall on all of the high needs of controlling the media.

[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:41.920]
Oh, the high needs are controlling the media. Great. Okay. Thank you very much. Louis do a Louis Ferrican do an voice.

[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:49.260]
The high needs are controlling the media. How do you like that? I didn't know the media was in charge of our education. Of course the media brainwashing the public. That's right.

[02:14:49.640 --> 02:15:01.540]
They're maybe brainwashing them. The name of the book is farewell to God. The author is Charles temple and unfortunately it's published by M and S publishing because this guy is a Canadian a by McClellan and Stewart in Toronto.

[02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:07.800]
And it's not available in the US, which is a very I don't understand why that is. Why the hell should this book not be available in the US?

[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:19.000]
Damn it. But I will give you the number to call. It's an expensive book. It's 30 bucks. It's a hardcover book. It's well worth it because it's probably the most best investment anybody will make if they want to immediately.

[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:26.360]
If not sooner have all the arguments that they're looking for. Really we shouldn't have to argue because if you tell me there's a God, it's not incumbent about me to prove that there isn't.

[02:15:26.660 --> 02:15:36.240]
That's always the logic and reverse that the religious use. Oh, there's a little there's a little green monster on the ceiling there. Oh, yeah. Well prove that there isn't. Well, I don't see it. Well, yeah, but how do you explain?

[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:51.380]
Yeah, right. So anyway, on the chapter called the God myth and this is very brief, but it's a you know, I'll just pick little passages from this. It's very well worth hearing and Charles temple. Let me give the phone number first. It's area code 905 713 3852.

[02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:59.340]
And you have to talk to the order department. There's a book number, but it's just too many numbers 905 713 3852 order department that

[02:15:59.340 --> 02:16:09.620]
name of the book is farewell to God and the author is Charles temple them who says Christians are a small minority in the world, approximately four of every five people on the face of the earth believe in God other than the Christian God.

[02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:18.720]
The more than five billion people live on the earth, we hear a worship more than 300. God. If one includes the animist or travel religions, the number rises to more than 3000.

[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:31.780]
Are we to believe that only Christians are right? Christians need to remember that their beliefs came to them from the Jews. They inherited the concept of God from Israel and expanded to include the worship of Jesus of man as God, a practice most Jews, regardless.

[02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:44.700]
Blast for me in New Testament times the Jews were a relatively small group of Semitic people living mostly in a forbidding land at the eastern end of the Mediterranean. It was their belief that their God was the only true God and that the God's worship by their neighbors were all false.

[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:54.020]
Christians having superimposed on Judaism, the Christian faith had the temerity to insist that there is only one God there is and that the God of every other people on earth are spurious.

[02:16:54.640 --> 02:17:09.120]
The Apostle Paul stated bluntly in a letter he wrote to the Christian community at a thesis. There is no other name under heaven given among men by which you may be saved for there is salvation in no other such insufferable presumption and consider the implications.

[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:26.260]
Paul is asserting that anyone in the world who does not worship his God is damned forever but let comments as rule for a moment. It is reasonable to believe that if the creator of all earth and the father of all mankind wanted to reveal himself and his will to the men and women of the world, he would do so only to a tiny group of Mediterranean people leaving the remainder of the world in ignorance.

[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:38.040]
But many Christians do believe in this. They believe that apart from their God, all men and women of impagant darkness, indeed it is this conviction that provides the motivation for Christians and their efforts to get the gospel message out.

[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:46.960]
Even more incredibly, Christians believe that the failure to accept Jesus Christ the Savior in order to be consigned to death at an endless hell. The implication of this belief is clear.

[02:17:47.460 --> 02:17:54.260]
It is that the vast majority of the men, women and children who have lived on earth are in hell suffering endless torment and will remain in this condition forever.

[02:17:54.860 --> 02:18:03.080]
To believe this is to make the Christian God a monster beyond imagining any intelligent human being will recognize that the concept is incredible.

[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:18.040]
Yet it is the clear teaching of the New Testament and a quote from that chapter by. And of course this guy was a Christian minister for 19 years in Toronto, a good buddy of Billy Graham who says his full of crap and finally came to his own conclusions and left the church and has got a brain now.

[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:30.440]
And thanks for himself and has written a fantastic book and he bunks very simply and very directly and very easily and very accurately all of this garbage, all this kaka with the gods with their that Jews with their God and the William with their Godness one in the muzzle.

[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:39.000]
It's all a bunch of baloney and of course in this country where we got all these religious fanatics running around trying to stick superstition and gobbledy look into the school system.

[02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:45.860]
If we had as many people running around trying to teach you learning something in the school system, we would have people in the IQ bigger than their fingernail who would not be accident.

[02:18:45.860 --> 02:18:56.320]
No questions. Let's go to a mobile in Kendall. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing? I'm weak. I'm weak. My voice is weak like I'm like, I can tell you need to do something about that cold.

[02:18:56.320 --> 02:19:09.820]
Now cold is going away. It's just this audience. I'm weak and more now. I'm burned out from assholes. I've been listening to you for a while and I haven't heard you kiss nobody's ass. Yeah, I don't. I'm not an ass kisser. Yeah. Look, if I had a player on here and he's playing great.

[02:19:10.500 --> 02:19:21.960]
I would say you're doing a great job. Okay, but I'm not going to kiss somebody's ass just because they're on a certain team. What's the point? I do you. But not only that we got so many other ass kissers in this town. What the hell do I need to kiss ass for?

[02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:35.860]
You're right. You know, I think I am a hockey fan. I play the sport every week practically. Yeah. And and regardless, they're not doing good. Oh, well, there's no money. But what is wrong with these people in this town? What has happened to this to the audience?

[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:46.980]
What has happened to the people who are supposedly support this team? They have they have locked you on out. They have nothing to say. I'm going to tell you something after today. I will never mention the H word on this show again. Ever.

[02:19:47.420 --> 02:19:59.560]
You got a lot of people that love the H word. Well, that's not the same word. Have a great day, pal. All these hockey calls on playing this Mike Lang stuff and Bob Cole and Bill, he would have what's one of my waste in my time for here?

[02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:14.800]
And I think there are people. And then of course, then the rib man, you know, people who have done shows yet. People, the only calls we used to get off the earth would get 10 million calls screaming and yelling complaining. Get this crap off the air. And the only calls we never get are people wanted freebies.

[02:20:14.800 --> 02:20:32.460]
They start that's right that those shows were an abortion because the only thing people wanted. We used to give away free tickets, Panther T shirts. It's just like the assholes in the stands when they're throwing those T shirts up. It's not only the little kids that get hyperventilating even the adult is the arena. Hey, I want it. They're like killing each other for a stupid guy. Then T shirt.

[02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:43.000]
That's the epitome of the excitement in the arena. Please don't tell me it's because the players are sticking to them. It's a lot of those guys are trying. They may not be all that good, but a lot of those guys at least are going out there and give it a shot.

[02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:51.780]
And compared to the first two years, which believe me, I remember that like it was yesterday on our most Colatostays were great compared to that Roger Nielsen garbage they were playing.

[02:20:51.780 --> 02:21:02.720]
Roger who while the old coach. Oh my God. I'm serious. I'm doing a show in Sanskrit. I'm in the middle of Siberia and I'm doing a goddamn show in Sanskrit. These people are like Greek. They're Greek.

[02:21:02.980 --> 02:21:18.900]
Right. That's it. And like I said, after they never they the hockey were there. You'll never hear another breath about it. Those people had tune in to hear about that on the show. Find a new home. Baby, you won't find anybody else in this town talking about it. And for good reason too, because even if they knew something about it, they'd be spinning their wheels. They'd be wasting their time.

[02:21:20.380 --> 02:21:30.740]
I'm friends. I believe this country had some poor, strong leadership for that. I need your chicks and my daughter.

[02:21:31.260 --> 02:21:43.220]
Friends, I can assure you I know what's best for you. Good man, all Christian. Trying to run our bodies with that baldness there's about the right thing.

[02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:13.200]
I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say

[02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:43.180]
that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to

[02:22:48.780 --> 02:23:01.600]
say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I want make sure that I give you exact

[02:23:04.780 --> 02:23:11.240]
We got the Marlins and the devil rays. Oh my God the devil rays. Remember all those Yahoo's in Tampa when they first the big.

[02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:18.540]
So and there's another example of how sanity prevailed something as as marginal as baseball as a game.

[02:23:20.240 --> 02:23:30.760]
And these Yahoo's over there were having a nervous breakdown about the name they were going to boycott the team and they were going to force them to change the name and guess what they didn't force them to change the name and there's still a guy named Tampa devil rays.

[02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:35.640]
And because they're an expansion team maybe they'll be a team that maybe the Marlins can compete with who knows.

[02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:44.540]
But there you go another example of narrow minded people are you can't say that well guess what they did it's right on the uniforms the devil rays the devil made him do it just like this.

[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:56.700]
Baptist leader who said the devil made him do it the Reverend Henry Lions and battle leader of organizations largest religious groups which charged Wednesday with transgressions generally associated with mobsters rather than clergymen.

[02:23:56.700 --> 02:24:12.480]
Racketeering and Grand theft state prosecutors charged Lions 55 of a St. Petersburg all the devil did make him do it with engaging in a systematic scheme to steal at least $330,000 from several organizations and corporations including the anti defamation league a Jewish group.

[02:24:12.580 --> 02:24:20.400]
Oh I shouldn't be talking about that this guy's black sorry see unless it's that racist thing and becoming out again put it back in okay I'll put it back in.

[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:27.060]
Yeah, just like when I was talking about the soccer game time up all the traffic there were some assholes calling that's a racial thing.

[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:31.320]
Mon if it was about I wouldn't give a crap where they were from okay take your soccer and blow it out your ass.

[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:38.580]
If it was all the Dutch team on their time up the highway that unless of course they were handing out free weed because they got much better weed than the Jamaican.

[02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:39.780]
Yeah, oh yeah they do.

[02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:41.940]
Here's a pay phone in for Lauderdale hello.

[02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:42.980]
Hi Neil.

[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:43.580]
Yes sir.

[02:24:43.700 --> 02:24:48.680]
I'm up in Broward and I got the other red and just to go along with somebody education thing.

[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:56.560]
One of their main headline today how to do about that they have an equivalency test if you can't pass questions in school.

[02:24:58.380 --> 02:25:08.560]
And they graded them wrong so 67 or so peak pupils who didn't pass got notified that they'll pass and they don't want to hurt these kids feelings.

[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:08.820]
Right.

[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:09.860]
So they pass.

[02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:10.280]
That's right.

[02:25:10.760 --> 02:25:13.040]
They they can't pass equivalency test.

[02:25:13.180 --> 02:25:16.660]
Social promotion baby that's what that's what it be all about we don't want to hurt nobody's feelings.

[02:25:16.660 --> 02:25:18.960]
They don't want people in school when they're 45 years old.

[02:25:19.140 --> 02:25:19.220]
Right.

[02:25:19.620 --> 02:25:22.200]
With so much people who graded in the test.

[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:22.620]
They did.

[02:25:22.800 --> 02:25:24.440]
They probably failed it too man.

[02:25:24.620 --> 02:25:27.620]
They did just you know another line of succession thanks for the good news sir.

[02:25:28.100 --> 02:25:33.540]
The dumbing of America like I told you and here we got a bunch of bright kids who are like honor students many of them.

[02:25:34.260 --> 02:25:41.000]
And oh yeah let's have them arrested because we don't like this pamphlet they wrote that was probably very you know was bizarre and off the while I still haven't seen it.

[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:52.380]
Robert's time back sought and like he said he was ready to write a skating hospital column attacking those kids and how grotesque this stuff was irresponsible and he saw it and he said hey some of it was pretty amusing.

[02:25:52.700 --> 02:25:57.080]
And what's the big simmiss here and cut the crap and don't be putting no kids in jail.

[02:25:57.660 --> 02:26:02.540]
They got guns if they're up you know doing an aberrant stuff then put their ass in jail.

[02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:06.900]
They're disrupting the goddamn class then kick them out of school and to spend them and expel them.

[02:26:06.900 --> 02:26:12.300]
But I don't know as long as they don't say anything we don't like then we'll just keep passing them right along there and give me diploma.

[02:26:12.620 --> 02:26:19.760]
See it and like I said we're going to all this racial talk here today and now that I look at this thing and of course this is my initial instinct anyway it's not a racial issue.

[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:28.120]
I mean there's a lot of racial tensions of killing high and they've had a lot of problems over the last several years with race at killing high but that's not what this is all about.

[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:35.200]
And that's what people are turning it into including assholes like our title bomb at the ADL this man I'm going to tell you our title bomb to me.

[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:51.940]
Is just beyond description this town is got about a handful of people and every time some issue comes up they either go to Bob Coons or our title bomb or some of these same old tired hacks that have been hanging around this town making a lifelong career of being Ojan provocatour

[02:26:51.940 --> 02:26:53.360]
and that's basically all they are.

[02:26:53.540 --> 02:27:00.560]
Oh yes this is very provocative and it's way beyond the line and we better investigate investigate what what the hell is there to investigate.

[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:10.260]
The revenge of the nerds I mean in a bunch of cartoons in here you know there seem to be a billion shoe stores in this town but there's one that's way above the rest and that's brandy shoes and pomp and obi.

[02:28:10.420 --> 02:28:11.420]
Oh

[02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:16.720]
I found that I can get it back up

[02:28:17.300 --> 02:28:20.140]
That is nothing more than oil juice cut.

[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:20.480]
Yes.

[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:22.160]
Oh, I know.

[02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:22.580]
Yeah.

[02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:24.200]
Number is my head.

[02:28:24.900 --> 02:28:25.620]
That's enough.

[02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:27.480]
But it's way too much.

[02:28:28.060 --> 02:28:33.360]
I have to say that they're not satisfied with this one because it's been an hour to kick in the Viagra pill.

[02:28:33.700 --> 02:28:34.580]
Didn't you see the story on that?

[02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:41.340]
So now that and this is a true story people are going to say I'm making this up they're getting together they group of doctors and Pfizer and whoever else.

[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:44.060]
And they're going to have a wafer.

[02:28:45.340 --> 02:28:56.240]
For instant within just a matter of minutes what you do is seriously I'm not making this up you put the wafer in your mouth you suck on it for just a short time and it gets bigger and you have to go to your place for that.

[02:28:56.680 --> 02:29:05.760]
I didn't say that kind of a wafer and I didn't say who is going to be sucking on what okay I said you suck on it for a little while that gets bigger and then getting back to the Viagra.

[02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:10.600]
Okay here's the fact that says Peter Bolger is the number one first class flaming asshole.

[02:29:11.020 --> 02:29:12.000]
Well we knew that.

[02:29:12.500 --> 02:29:18.780]
And a liar and a bullcrap artist and a no nothing and a corporate ass sucker and a real piece of turd.

[02:29:18.980 --> 02:29:28.620]
That's right we don't want the Lawrence Wilkeshire one estate ads right you and Harry penis and Walter say well have a great time with those old jingles and John Ford too by the way through him in there through him in the mix.

[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:30.140]
Here's Coral Gables hello.

[02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:30.820]
Hello.

[02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:31.440]
Yes sir.

[02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:32.080]
How you doing?

[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:32.400]
Great.

[02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:35.260]
Maybe if you want to hear an update on the Vatican incident.

[02:29:35.620 --> 02:29:35.780]
Yes.

[02:29:36.120 --> 02:29:41.780]
Okay actually this could be just go down as the Roman version of the O.J. Simpson incident.

[02:29:42.020 --> 02:29:43.020]
They went down at the Vatican?

[02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:43.760]
Yeah.

[02:29:44.040 --> 02:29:45.520]
There's no fact in the church.

[02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:45.940]
Yeah.

[02:29:46.060 --> 02:29:55.560]
This guy that was murdered was the at the officer from Switzerland and he became he was assigned a day before the highest officer for the Vatican Army.

[02:29:55.880 --> 02:29:56.060]
Yeah.

[02:29:56.700 --> 02:30:00.000]
And that was the first time that the non-Hitalian was going to be.

[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:00.100]
Yeah.

[02:30:00.240 --> 02:30:06.040]
It became the highest ranking officer but the weird thing about this whole situation was his wife.

[02:30:06.460 --> 02:30:14.960]
Well, happened to be from Ben as well also was killed and there was a young officer maybe 2223 also found in the in the melee.

[02:30:15.660 --> 02:30:18.420]
So in actual you there were three people killed.

[02:30:18.900 --> 02:30:20.940]
So how about that killed by whom?

[02:30:21.340 --> 02:30:22.100]
They don't know yet.

[02:30:22.420 --> 02:30:22.720]
Yes sir.

[02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:23.340]
Oh.

[02:30:25.140 --> 02:30:26.140]
Okay well he's gone.

[02:30:26.140 --> 02:30:38.760]
Why don't you tell us who was the newly appointed the dog done a captain in the chip both El Henarell of the Swiss guard the newly appointed one the one that tried to save the Pope when the last attempt on his mate was newly appointed one of the other.

[02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:40.340]
Well, that's on CNN right now.

[02:30:40.400 --> 02:30:43.940]
They're showing the Pope and they're showing this window and there's a lot of that there's Lee Harvey Oswald.

[02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:44.820]
Oh no it's Jack Ruby.

[02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:45.160]
Yeah.

[02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:48.340]
And one of the other Swiss guards been apparently had a problem with zero rate.

[02:30:48.540 --> 02:30:49.320]
Oh, there's Rome.

[02:30:49.540 --> 02:30:50.640]
I know where that is right there.

[02:30:50.700 --> 02:30:51.780]
It's right by the Spanish steps.

[02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:52.480]
There's a Roma.

[02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:53.400]
That wasn't a Vatican.

[02:30:53.560 --> 02:30:54.600]
That was right by the Spanish steps.

[02:30:54.600 --> 02:30:55.160]
That's it.

[02:30:55.380 --> 02:30:59.900]
Anyway, go ahead and there's El Vaticano killed the newly appointed captain and his wife.

[02:30:59.940 --> 02:31:00.260]
Yeah.

[02:31:00.320 --> 02:31:01.760]
And shot himself for what?

[02:31:02.220 --> 02:31:04.440]
I guess he didn't like the guy or maybe God told us.

[02:31:04.480 --> 02:31:05.400]
So why don't we hear about this?

[02:31:05.480 --> 02:31:07.800]
We got my story here with these ratings coming off.

[02:31:07.860 --> 02:31:10.460]
This is the big and you're talking about some Swiss guards over there in a guy.

[02:31:10.520 --> 02:31:11.300]
Well, I don't care about it.

[02:31:11.400 --> 02:31:15.440]
You'll find a conno and a bunch of a crazy goi in over there in a Vatican like that's a new story.

[02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:18.140]
Is that something new crazy goi in the Vatican?

[02:31:18.260 --> 02:31:19.080]
Oh come on.

[02:31:19.180 --> 02:31:21.020]
Will you fudge back and start looking?

[02:31:21.020 --> 02:31:26.080]
Oh, I'm not sure.

[02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:30.200]
Oh, I'm not sure.

[02:31:30.220 --> 02:31:34.380]
Oh, I'm not sure.

[02:31:39.880 --> 02:31:43.060]
People are watching women.

[02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:48.440]
I said, ran their green shoes and you know what I'm not sure.

[02:31:51.400 --> 02:31:55.160]
I'm not sure.

[02:31:56.060 --> 02:31:57.960]
I ain't looking.

[02:31:58.580 --> 02:32:01.860]
Just a little too much.

[02:32:03.240 --> 02:32:06.080]
That's all a little too slow.

[02:32:07.640 --> 02:32:10.940]
Here's not what it's just a little too long.

[02:32:12.560 --> 02:32:17.780]
But while they're rolling, I will be mowing all the end.

[02:32:17.920 --> 02:32:21.060]
Here's got a really big trowel trowel.

[02:32:22.040 --> 02:32:25.300]
Look all the cream if you let it out.

[02:32:26.880 --> 02:32:30.040]
Here's got a really big trowel trowel.

[02:32:30.160 --> 02:32:32.820]
I'm fishing for the world.

[02:32:53.240 --> 02:32:54.120]
Oh, right.

[02:32:58.340 --> 02:33:01.960]
I'm pretty seen the most disturbing information in history of my life.

[02:33:02.020 --> 02:33:02.800]
I may have to go my home.

[02:33:02.800 --> 02:33:02.800]

[02:33:03.760 --> 02:33:06.360]
I'm going to go to the beach.

[02:33:06.360 --> 02:33:11.060]
I'm going to go to the beach.

[02:33:12.660 --> 02:33:13.660]
I'm speechless.

[02:33:14.360 --> 02:33:15.820]
Sam, our promotion man was just in here.

[02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:19.000]
Let me take a look at the picture of Enrique and the magazine.

[02:33:22.740 --> 02:33:29.320]
He was telling me the story about what I was on one of my many trips during the seven months that I was doing the limbo rock between stations.

[02:33:30.260 --> 02:33:34.800]
Enrique's concert was coming up at the Miami Arena, which I was also a lot of time the weekend that it took place.

[02:33:36.380 --> 02:33:40.720]
The first time that they called the house my mother was at the house dog sitting.

[02:33:41.740 --> 02:33:43.020]
Enrique was a secretary.

[02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:49.820]
Enrique called the house offering tickets for the concert.

[02:33:52.240 --> 02:33:57.700]
Enrique was on the speaker phone and his secretary made it in place to call.

[02:33:57.700 --> 02:33:59.480]
Enrique was sitting there listening.

[02:33:59.540 --> 02:34:02.360]
My mother answered the phone.

[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:12.440]
I am so psychotic at this point in my life.

[02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:14.840]
I don't think I can continue.

[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:21.600]
I don't think I can continue.

[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:22.500]
I would like to be him.

[02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:24.400]
You would like to be him.

[02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:35.480]
You would like to be him.

[02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:36.620]
I would like to be him.

[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:42.800]
Enrique is a fruit cake.

[02:34:43.420 --> 02:34:45.300]
He is a real Latin man.

[02:34:45.300 --> 02:35:14.180]
I would like to be him.

[02:35:14.260 --> 02:35:15.280]
I would like to be him.

[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:15.280]

[02:35:36.260 --> 02:35:38.060]
I would like to be him.

[02:35:38.240 --> 02:35:39.200]
I would like to be him.

[02:35:39.220 --> 02:35:44.360]
I would like to be him.

[02:35:58.660 --> 02:36:12.280]
I would like to be him.

[02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:13.240]
I would like to be him.

[02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:13.440]
I would like to be him.

[02:36:13.460 --> 02:36:14.320]
I would like to be him.

[02:36:22.580 --> 02:36:27.480]
I would like to be him.

[02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:27.480]

[02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:28.720]
I would like to be him.

[02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:32.120]
I would like to be him.

[02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:42.160]
I would like to be him.

[02:36:46.820 --> 02:36:48.640]
I would like to be him.

[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:51.140]
I would like to be him.

[02:36:51.440 --> 02:37:00.480]
I would like to be him.

[02:37:18.580 --> 02:37:29.520]
I would like to be him.

[02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:29.980]
I would like to be him.

[02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:29.980]

[02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:29.980]

[02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:59.960]
I would like to be him.

[02:37:59.960 --> 02:37:59.960]

[02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:04.180]
I would like to be him.

[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:09.240]
I would like to be him.

[02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:10.780]
I would like to be him.

[02:38:12.440 --> 02:38:16.080]
I would like to be him.

[02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:46.020]
I would like to be him.

[02:38:46.020 --> 02:38:46.060]
I would like to be him.

[02:38:46.060 --> 02:38:46.060]

[02:38:46.060 --> 02:38:46.060]

[02:38:46.060 --> 02:38:54.940]
I would like to be him.

[02:38:57.520 --> 02:39:00.220]
I would like to be him.

[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:01.460]
I would like to be him.

[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:15.020]
I would like to be him.

[02:39:15.020 --> 02:39:45.000]
I would like to be him.

[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:45.000]

[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:45.000]

[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:45.000]

[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:45.300]
I would like to be him.

[02:39:47.860 --> 02:39:51.680]
I would like to be him.

[02:39:54.680 --> 02:39:58.060]
I would like to be him.

[02:39:58.060 --> 02:39:58.060]

[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:11.780]
I would like to be him.

[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:22.640]
I would like to be him.

[02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:28.460]
It's an asshole celebration and they're all out on the streets

[02:40:28.460 --> 02:40:33.040]
See them on the sidewalk over here, let's shuffle their feet

[02:40:33.640 --> 02:40:38.060]
20,000 assholes to an asshole's promenade

[02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:42.440]
Step aside, kill their people there to asshole's parade

[02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:56.600]
We got the asshole freedom, the asshole's mine

[02:40:56.600 --> 02:41:01.420]
The asshole for Jesus, the asshole for guns

[02:41:01.420 --> 02:41:06.220]
The asshole for justice, the asshole for crime

[02:41:06.220 --> 02:41:11.200]
The asshole for asshole, the asshole for all guns

[02:41:20.160 --> 02:41:22.700]
The asshole for the fucking hell

[02:41:22.700 --> 02:41:22.700]

[02:41:22.700 --> 02:41:22.700]

[02:41:22.700 --> 02:41:25.180]
The asshole for making money, for making all the rules

[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:29.940]
Making all our jobs, and then I got to go

[02:41:29.940 --> 02:41:34.320]
The asshole's on the water, the asshole's the sky

[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:39.340]
And then I got to sell a pile of wanted, and they have so many people flying

[02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:53.300]
So, see if you want to tell me how I really made the phrase

[02:41:53.300 --> 02:42:00.440]
My head's my class, or am I just another asshole on the streets

[02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:31.340]
The asshole's kissy orders, and asshole's broke both

[02:42:31.340 --> 02:42:35.740]
The asshole's get elected, because the asshole's kissy's broke

[02:42:35.740 --> 02:42:40.560]
I want to say it's good, that all the asshole's never died

[02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:45.020]
They just made it big, and it's mostly life

[02:42:45.020 --> 02:42:49.940]
The asshole's in the water, the asshole's in the night

[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:54.780]
The asshole's got a damn asshole, because the phrase

[02:42:54.780 --> 02:42:59.420]
That's 20,000 asshole, the asshole for the nation

[02:42:59.940 --> 02:43:04.260]
The fuck's that good, and he's gonna let the asshole's on the rails

[02:43:17.980 --> 02:43:20.580]
I thought that was Spaniard, you wanted to get rid of Franco?

[02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:22.540]
Well, only for people who travel

[02:43:22.540 --> 02:43:23.140]
Oh, okay

[02:43:23.460 --> 02:43:26.500]
I would like to talk to you today about why this is such a pure, tanical country

[02:43:26.500 --> 02:43:27.160]
Yes, sir

[02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:28.440]
Take all the time you want

[02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:29.160]
Oh, thank you

[02:43:29.160 --> 02:43:31.480]
We are with very few people know or think about

[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:34.440]
We are the only Protestant sectarian country in the world

[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:36.820]
And the Protestant sects in the city

[02:43:36.820 --> 02:43:38.260]
Different sects in the church

[02:43:38.260 --> 02:43:41.320]
Yeah, the Protestant sects in this country are the Baptist

[02:43:41.320 --> 02:43:43.760]
The Protestant sects?

[02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:45.120]
That's an anti-moron

[02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:46.900]
Oh, sects

[02:43:46.900 --> 02:43:48.320]
Yeah, sects?

[02:43:48.900 --> 02:43:49.500]
Yeah

[02:43:49.500 --> 02:43:52.320]
They differ from the church religions of Europe

[02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:55.700]
The church religions of Europe are usually state-related

[02:43:55.700 --> 02:43:56.680]
They're hierarchical

[02:43:57.420 --> 02:44:03.160]
You're supposed to obey the bishop or the priest or whatever you're supposed to obey the bithel

[02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:04.300]
By the O2, God

[02:44:04.300 --> 02:44:04.680]
Right

[02:44:05.840 --> 02:44:12.360]
But these religions in Europe believe an original sin that people in institutions are inherently inferior

[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:16.180]
And they shouldn't get bent out of shape when they do something wrong because that's just the way they are

[02:44:16.180 --> 02:44:22.480]
Now the Protestant sects in this country are congregational, they're not hierarchical

[02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:24.120]
Yeah, the hierarchical

[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:25.200]
Okay

[02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:28.560]
The priest is an employee of the church

[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:31.740]
You're supposed to read the Bible and make up your own mind about it

[02:44:31.740 --> 02:44:35.800]
And whatever you make up your mind out to be, you're morally obligated to carry it out

[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:38.340]
But probably the most important thing here is

[02:44:38.340 --> 02:44:39.540]
They don't know what you're going to do

[02:44:39.540 --> 02:44:42.200]
Like a French guy that likes little kids, is that a Franco-Petophile?

[02:44:42.460 --> 02:44:43.080]
Go ahead, I'm sorry

[02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:44.080]
They don't believe in me

[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:46.860]
I'm just trying to spice up what is a, you know, I am the, you know, good intentions

[02:44:46.860 --> 02:44:48.440]
But it's common to say, you know what I'm saying?

[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:49.460]
It's a common to say, yeah

[02:44:49.460 --> 02:44:49.820]
Yeah

[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:53.740]
So what is the point of all of this though?

[02:44:53.820 --> 02:44:56.920]
I mean, it's obviously you're preaching the choir here, what's the point?

[02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:03.000]
Well, they believe in a perfect ability, the people religious people here believe in perfect ability that you must not send

[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:03.440]
Yeah

[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:04.180]
At all

[02:45:04.180 --> 02:45:04.660]
Yeah

[02:45:04.660 --> 02:45:07.440]
And this manifests itself in all kinds of ways in our society

[02:45:07.440 --> 02:45:10.360]
Well thank God we got a president who's straightening them all out, thank you

[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:12.060]
What the hell was he talking about?

[02:45:12.500 --> 02:45:14.740]
Man, he was from Lake Worth, well that explains it

[02:45:14.740 --> 02:45:17.220]
He was talking about higher-archical crass

[02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:19.700]
But he was right, Franco-Folvia

[02:45:19.700 --> 02:45:21.340]
I like that, Franco-Folvia

[02:45:21.340 --> 02:45:22.900]
That's like Franco-American spaghetti

[02:45:23.500 --> 02:45:24.620]
Here's Kendall, hello

[02:45:25.100 --> 02:45:25.960]
Neil, yes sir

[02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:26.640]
How you doing? Great

[02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:28.480]
I'm a 22 year old male

[02:45:28.480 --> 02:45:30.820]
And I'm a little disappointed in the younger females in this town

[02:45:30.820 --> 02:45:33.380]
Not being one of the main groups listening to your show

[02:45:33.900 --> 02:45:35.500]
So to get some of these girls back

[02:45:35.500 --> 02:45:38.700]
I want to sing a quick excerpt from the Titanic song in Spanish

[02:45:38.700 --> 02:45:39.460]
Okay

[02:45:39.460 --> 02:45:43.140]
Okay, got a no-j and me swan yours

[02:45:43.140 --> 02:46:10.140]
Thank you

[02:46:22.610 --> 02:46:24.430]
I'm getting a little flimmer

[02:46:25.250 --> 02:46:26.330]
Oh, here we go

[02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:29.190]
Where's the number is that?

[02:46:29.710 --> 02:46:30.430]
I love that, good idea

[02:46:30.430 --> 02:46:31.550]
Which show one is that on?

[02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:33.130]
You're the one I'm talking about?

[02:46:33.590 --> 02:46:34.910]
Yeah, you don't like that one?

[02:46:35.130 --> 02:46:35.550]
Yes, great

[02:46:35.550 --> 02:46:36.610]
I love it

[02:46:36.610 --> 02:46:38.150]
It's called Sit and So Long

[02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:39.610]
Sit and I said

[02:46:39.610 --> 02:46:41.890]
Sit and So Long is the one you're going to...

[02:46:41.890 --> 02:46:43.710]
Mmm, real man, that a cruise ship

[02:46:44.690 --> 02:46:46.590]
I never got lucky and a cruise ship

[02:46:47.410 --> 02:46:50.450]
I'm the only person who never got lucky and a cruise ship

[02:46:50.450 --> 02:46:53.710]
Every night at the side of the tracks

[02:46:54.450 --> 02:46:56.290]
I watch it

[02:46:56.290 --> 02:46:59.130]
I sing it for

[02:46:59.130 --> 02:47:04.550]
I sing that song for 29 times

[02:47:07.450 --> 02:47:11.710]
I inhale to trouble the popcorn

[02:47:12.450 --> 02:47:16.790]
Raisin as fangovers

[02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:22.330]
The movie's so long I got to where it depends

[02:47:22.330 --> 02:47:24.990]
That stands back up, I can't stand it

[02:47:24.990 --> 02:47:29.870]
The first time I saw it

[02:47:29.870 --> 02:47:31.670]
I'm nervous

[02:47:31.670 --> 02:47:34.310]
Then you're my stretch pants

[02:47:35.550 --> 02:47:38.150]
It's a good thing

[02:47:38.790 --> 02:47:42.950]
The thing was so unnerving

[02:47:44.390 --> 02:47:47.810]
I've been sitting so long

[02:47:47.810 --> 02:47:52.430]
I've got hand-wrapped the sides of the two-wall ones

[02:47:53.270 --> 02:47:58.970]
I can't wait for the duristers cut to come out

[02:47:59.950 --> 02:48:01.510]
I can't wait for the movie to end

[02:48:02.190 --> 02:48:03.770]
So I can watch it again

[02:48:03.770 --> 02:48:05.310]
And again

[02:48:06.130 --> 02:48:07.090]
And again

[02:48:07.090 --> 02:48:08.150]
And again

[02:48:08.150 --> 02:48:08.710]
And again

[02:48:08.710 --> 02:48:14.410]
I got one from a double figure

[02:48:15.150 --> 02:48:19.130]
My flutter has worked out

[02:48:20.150 --> 02:48:25.690]
My total pearl that was next to the empty food can

[02:48:26.790 --> 02:48:30.350]
Nothing is of the count of the day

[02:48:38.270 --> 02:48:42.070]
So my heart will go on

[02:48:42.070 --> 02:48:47.370]
And I will go on

[02:48:47.370 --> 02:48:49.770]
I can't believe it's not the bottom

[02:48:49.770 --> 02:48:51.770]
I can't believe it's not the bottom

[02:48:52.570 --> 02:48:54.110]
I can't stand it

[02:48:54.110 --> 02:48:57.430]
I have a feeling I'm going to be dipping into some fish food

[02:48:57.430 --> 02:48:58.490]
What?

[02:48:58.490 --> 02:49:00.130]
What are you going like that for?

[02:49:00.370 --> 02:49:00.930]
Good time

[02:49:01.490 --> 02:49:03.130]
Yeah, well sir are you Mr. Hatcha?

[02:49:03.190 --> 02:49:03.790]
Not as quick

[02:49:03.790 --> 02:49:05.890]
Oh, I got to tell you a great story about that

[02:49:06.810 --> 02:49:09.290]
1973 I'm working at WSPD in Sarasota

[02:49:09.290 --> 02:49:11.850]
And my landlord was this kind of like I would say

[02:49:12.850 --> 02:49:15.030]
45 to 50ish kind of a nerdy guy

[02:49:15.030 --> 02:49:15.590]
He was okay

[02:49:15.590 --> 02:49:18.150]
And he was just a little on the eccentric side

[02:49:18.150 --> 02:49:20.930]
And he kept every time I get into any kind of conversation

[02:49:20.930 --> 02:49:21.730]
I'd run into him

[02:49:21.730 --> 02:49:23.550]
He would start cocking me a china

[02:49:23.550 --> 02:49:25.350]
And I'm not worried about dying

[02:49:25.350 --> 02:49:28.050]
Because they're coming up with all these great cures for everything

[02:49:28.050 --> 02:49:31.090]
And by the time I'm in my 70s, they'll have people who live forever

[02:49:31.570 --> 02:49:32.370]
Guess what?

[02:49:32.830 --> 02:49:33.390]
He's dead

[02:49:34.010 --> 02:49:34.650]
He's dead!

[02:49:35.090 --> 02:49:35.490]
Alright!

[02:49:35.850 --> 02:49:36.970]
Pull the hell out of you, Mr.

[02:49:37.510 --> 02:49:38.610]
You're dead! See ya!

[02:49:38.810 --> 02:49:39.330]
Maybe he'll get back

[02:49:39.330 --> 02:49:40.770]
That's right, when they dig his ass up

[02:49:40.770 --> 02:49:42.670]
I'll probably be living back there in Sarasota

[02:49:42.670 --> 02:49:43.770]
And hey, how you doing doc?

[02:49:44.650 --> 02:49:45.610]
Here's for a lot of Dale

[02:49:45.610 --> 02:49:45.890]
Hello

[02:49:45.890 --> 02:49:46.470]
Hello

[02:49:46.470 --> 02:49:47.090]
Yes sir

[02:49:47.090 --> 02:49:47.410]
Neil

[02:49:47.850 --> 02:49:51.210]
Me and the guys at work were hoping you could elaborate on something first

[02:49:51.210 --> 02:49:51.730]
Yes sir

[02:49:51.730 --> 02:49:52.710]
Glory holds

[02:49:53.350 --> 02:49:53.370]
Yeah

[02:49:53.890 --> 02:49:54.530]
Is it

[02:49:54.530 --> 02:49:58.210]
Well, now, oh come on, you're asking me like you guys don't know what glory holds are?

[02:49:58.510 --> 02:49:59.470]
But you have a glory hold!

[02:49:59.770 --> 02:49:59.770]

[02:49:59.770 --> 02:50:04.310]
You throw it out so fast that we don't know the proper, what it pertains to is it

[02:50:04.310 --> 02:50:07.110]
Pulls in the star walls or is it something but...

[02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:07.150]
Of course

[02:50:07.150 --> 02:50:07.950]
Or is it holes in your what?

[02:50:08.310 --> 02:50:09.350]
Is it someone's butthole?

[02:50:09.730 --> 02:50:11.110]
Well, that could be a part of it

[02:50:11.110 --> 02:50:12.530]
That would be inside the glory hole

[02:50:12.530 --> 02:50:15.330]
But both of them could be pertained as one such

[02:50:15.330 --> 02:50:16.210]
A glory hole?

[02:50:16.450 --> 02:50:17.830]
I mean a hole is a hole is a hole

[02:50:17.830 --> 02:50:19.810]
And you gotta see the whole thing, you know what I'm talking about?

[02:50:20.010 --> 02:50:20.510]
A whole picture

[02:50:20.510 --> 02:50:24.630]
Right, the whole picture, you gotta get your pneumatic drill and you gotta drill a hole in that

[02:50:25.310 --> 02:50:28.930]
Mahogany and that hard wood and that cement, whatever is in there, it's cement with the teeth

[02:50:29.510 --> 02:50:30.670]
And that's a glory hole

[02:50:31.130 --> 02:50:33.990]
Alright, so it doesn't matter what you're looking at on the other side, right?

[02:50:34.210 --> 02:50:34.530]
Right

[02:50:34.530 --> 02:50:37.730]
It could be somebody sitting or something

[02:50:37.730 --> 02:50:39.150]
Or something that rhymes with sitting, right?

[02:50:39.690 --> 02:50:40.310]
That's right

[02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:42.650]
Alright Neil, I'm glad we cleared that up

[02:50:42.650 --> 02:50:43.810]
Okay, I hope you find a good one

[02:50:43.810 --> 02:50:44.210]
Alright

[02:50:44.210 --> 02:50:44.810]
See ya

[02:50:45.970 --> 02:50:48.430]
Like they don't know what a glory hole is, right?

[02:50:48.430 --> 02:50:50.170]
We know what you're doing in your spare time

[02:50:50.170 --> 02:50:51.410]
You're looking for the glory hole

[02:50:51.410 --> 02:50:51.770]
Right

[02:50:51.770 --> 02:50:55.210]
And like I said, they do glory holes in ladies' restrooms

[02:50:55.990 --> 02:50:57.110]
Something to think about

[02:50:57.110 --> 02:51:00.010]
Wonder if anybody ever got a tongue caught in a glory hole, huh?

[02:51:00.510 --> 02:51:03.610]
Well, do you remember Ellie Brecker brought in that tongue in a package that day?

[02:51:03.910 --> 02:51:06.790]
Maybe they were just trying to pass some lunch

[02:51:08.070 --> 02:51:10.490]
Maybe that's what those guys are trying to do too, huh?

[02:51:11.110 --> 02:51:14.290]
Oh god, now he's gonna come up with these tube-stakes jokes when you just cut the crap

[02:51:14.290 --> 02:51:14.830]
Stop it

[02:51:15.430 --> 02:51:16.310]
Stop it right now, please

[02:51:16.310 --> 02:51:16.670]
Okay

[02:51:17.310 --> 02:51:19.030]
Here's a mobile in Hialeah, hello?

[02:51:19.030 --> 02:51:19.410]
Hello, Neil?

[02:51:19.610 --> 02:51:19.910]
Yes, sir

[02:51:19.910 --> 02:51:20.730]
How you doing, Neil?

[02:51:20.910 --> 02:51:21.430]
I'm doing great

[02:51:21.430 --> 02:51:24.930]
Listen, I'm 30 years old, Holyo, on sync-size

[02:51:25.430 --> 02:51:26.090]
Uncircum-size

[02:51:26.090 --> 02:51:26.610]
Yes, sir

[02:51:26.610 --> 02:51:27.070]
Okay

[02:51:27.910 --> 02:51:29.590]
Can I talk about NFSikes?

[02:51:29.850 --> 02:51:30.050]
Yes

[02:51:30.050 --> 02:51:30.690]
Am I see?

[02:51:31.210 --> 02:51:32.830]
Okay, I had a girlfriend, Cuban

[02:51:33.990 --> 02:51:36.350]
And she tried one, she loved it

[02:51:36.350 --> 02:51:40.370]
But once she tried, I like, I put her and her finger up to my, you know, with spurs

[02:51:40.370 --> 02:51:41.390]
That's what you call it

[02:51:41.390 --> 02:51:43.410]
And I didn't like it at all

[02:51:44.110 --> 02:51:48.750]
Can we be a woman from Dominican Republic, Puerto Ricans, Cuban especially, going to that?

[02:51:49.270 --> 02:51:52.650]
South Africa and not my Central American definitely, it's a taboo

[02:51:53.350 --> 02:51:58.170]
But Cuban Puerto Ricans, Dominican, they love it, they have the big butt for something

[02:51:58.170 --> 02:51:59.530]
They use it

[02:51:59.530 --> 02:52:00.370]
All right

[02:52:00.370 --> 02:52:01.150]
All right

[02:52:01.150 --> 02:52:01.930]
Thanks for the good news

[02:52:01.930 --> 02:52:03.510]
Congratulations on the big numbers

[02:52:03.510 --> 02:52:04.330]
Thank you so much

[02:52:04.330 --> 02:52:06.510]
And thank you for your congratulations on your big numbers too

[02:52:06.510 --> 02:52:07.810]
Hey, you know it

[02:52:07.810 --> 02:52:08.250]
All right

[02:52:08.250 --> 02:52:08.990]
I pull out the umpah

[02:52:10.530 --> 02:52:10.970]
Yeah

[02:52:10.970 --> 02:52:15.810]
See, all you people are wondered why Cuban women have those big fat round asses now you understand

[02:52:16.290 --> 02:52:18.310]
Round and firm and fully packed

[02:52:18.970 --> 02:52:21.190]
Underlined, of course, the fully packed part

[02:52:21.190 --> 02:52:22.890]
I mean, are you going to go back into this again?

[02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:24.170]
Were you fudge-packing?

[02:52:24.210 --> 02:52:24.750]
No way

[02:52:24.750 --> 02:52:26.010]
Not this girl

[02:52:26.490 --> 02:52:27.330]
Oh, man

[02:52:27.330 --> 02:52:28.670]
How do we get started on that?

[02:52:29.210 --> 02:52:30.590]
That one poor innocent guy

[02:52:30.590 --> 02:52:32.390]
Oh, don't a smell awful, dirty down there

[02:52:32.390 --> 02:52:33.110]
Oh, yeah

[02:52:33.110 --> 02:52:34.510]
I don't know, you tell me

[02:52:35.790 --> 02:52:37.950]
All you heterosexual macho guys

[02:52:37.950 --> 02:52:41.310]
You tell me what it smells down down by the old rectum

[02:52:41.310 --> 02:52:41.550]
Rectum

[02:52:41.550 --> 02:52:42.050]
Tell me

[02:52:42.050 --> 02:52:43.330]
I don't wait for 10 years

[02:52:43.330 --> 02:52:44.130]
Yeah, I believe you

[02:52:44.130 --> 02:52:44.630]
Lylox

[02:52:45.150 --> 02:52:47.930]
Oh, man, it must be it's like the middle of almost the middle of May

[02:52:47.930 --> 02:52:52.030]
I bet you the lylox and the tulips are really blooming like up in Rochester now

[02:52:52.030 --> 02:52:54.170]
At Cobb's Hill in Durantysman Park

[02:52:54.890 --> 02:52:55.630]
Oh, yeah

[02:52:55.630 --> 02:52:57.210]
Just like a beautiful woman

[02:52:57.210 --> 02:52:57.690]
Rectum

[02:52:57.690 --> 02:52:59.950]
So anyway, this story about father rugs

[02:52:59.950 --> 02:53:03.050]
We better get into this tomorrow and have a lot of time on it, father James Porter

[02:53:03.050 --> 02:53:05.250]
One good thing, thank God about this

[02:53:05.250 --> 02:53:06.010]
He didn't discriminate

[02:53:06.010 --> 02:53:07.710]
He liked little girls and little boys

[02:53:07.710 --> 02:53:08.610]
He liked, you know what I'm saying?

[02:53:08.850 --> 02:53:09.830]
He spread it around

[02:53:09.830 --> 02:53:11.270]
There's no fact in the church

[02:53:11.270 --> 02:53:12.490]
Thank God for father Porter

[02:53:12.490 --> 02:53:13.510]
He didn't discriminate

[02:53:13.510 --> 02:53:15.590]
We don't like no priest who discriminates

[02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:20.690]
And it says he had a manic obsession for sex with young children for the three years that he was there

[02:53:20.690 --> 02:53:22.030]
No child was safe

[02:53:22.030 --> 02:53:23.410]
It seemed that he was everywhere

[02:53:23.410 --> 02:53:26.410]
In his office he forced his fingers between the legs of eight-year-old girls

[02:53:26.410 --> 02:53:29.190]
In the classrooms he handed out slaubring birthday kisses

[02:53:29.190 --> 02:53:31.890]
Pushing his tongue into the mouths of ten-year-old boys

[02:53:31.890 --> 02:53:33.630]
As the non-enchargerverted her eyes

[02:53:33.630 --> 02:53:35.390]
In other words, look the other way

[02:53:35.390 --> 02:53:37.390]
While somebody in the background whispered

[02:53:37.390 --> 02:53:38.930]
There's no fact in the church

[02:53:38.930 --> 02:53:39.570]
Huh

[02:53:40.090 --> 02:53:41.050]
Here's a lady in Miami

[02:53:41.050 --> 02:53:41.430]
Hello

[02:53:41.870 --> 02:53:42.270]
Hello

[02:53:42.270 --> 02:53:43.130]
Yes, ma'am

[02:53:43.130 --> 02:53:47.650]
Hi, I'm calling because my boyfriend says that you have a tape of OJ explaining about the murders

[02:53:47.650 --> 02:53:48.330]
Yeah

[02:53:48.890 --> 02:53:50.530]
I was just wondering if you would play that for me

[02:53:50.530 --> 02:53:51.210]
Yes, I can

[02:53:51.210 --> 02:53:51.990]
Thank you

[02:53:51.990 --> 02:53:52.930]
And have a great day

[02:53:52.930 --> 02:53:55.030]
Mike, can I ask you a question while I'm looking for it?

[02:53:55.170 --> 02:53:55.350]
Sure

[02:53:55.890 --> 02:53:57.750]
Do you, I don't want to get too personal

[02:53:57.750 --> 02:53:58.730]
Do you enjoy anal sex?

[02:53:59.230 --> 02:54:00.210]
No, I don't

[02:54:00.210 --> 02:54:00.810]
Okay, thank you

[02:54:00.810 --> 02:54:01.330]
You're welcome

[02:54:01.330 --> 02:54:02.710]
Ok, ma'am I've played it for you now

[02:54:02.710 --> 02:54:02.870]
Hi!

[02:54:03.130 --> 02:54:05.730]
You know what's important

[02:54:05.730 --> 02:54:06.210]
You know what!

[02:54:06.290 --> 02:54:07.590]
You don't like it when you have a food

[02:54:07.590 --> 02:54:08.390]
And when you have fruit

[02:54:08.390 --> 02:54:10.050]
And after you make an album

[02:54:10.810 --> 02:54:12.010]
By yourself, you get a different roll

[02:54:12.010 --> 02:54:15.110]
So Ienden called me

[02:54:15.110 --> 02:54:16.050]
''

[02:54:16.050 --> 02:54:18.290]
You know what they were called?

[02:54:18.790 --> 02:54:19.990]
Blood prise?

[02:54:20.290 --> 02:54:21.010]
Blood usable?

[02:54:21.930 --> 02:54:23.570]
See what I'm afraid here?

[02:54:23.910 --> 02:54:25.190]
Yeah but you know what their personalities

[02:54:25.190 --> 02:54:27.290]
Your利a, like ABC something like this

[02:54:27.290 --> 02:54:27.610]
BraIL

[02:54:30.270 --> 02:54:30.790]
One of them

[02:54:30.790 --> 02:54:31.490]
You know, son, don't know.

[02:54:31.710 --> 02:54:33.050]
So I'm gonna ask you, what am I gonna ask you?

[02:54:33.050 --> 02:54:33.290]
You know what?

[02:54:33.450 --> 02:54:34.210]
And I didn't know what was gonna happen.

[02:54:34.290 --> 02:54:34.590]
You know what?

[02:54:34.590 --> 02:54:34.930]
You know what?

[02:54:34.930 --> 02:54:35.510]
You know what I'm gonna ask you?

[02:54:35.590 --> 02:54:35.950]
You know what I'm gonna ask you?

[02:54:35.950 --> 02:54:36.430]
You know what I'm gonna ask you?

[02:54:36.430 --> 02:54:36.430]

[02:54:36.430 --> 02:54:36.550]
You know what?

[02:54:36.650 --> 02:54:36.670]
You know what?

[02:54:36.670 --> 02:54:37.370]
You know what I'm gonna ask you?

[02:54:37.370 --> 02:54:37.910]
You know what I'm gonna ask you?

[02:54:38.270 --> 02:54:39.170]
You know what I'm gonna ask you?

[02:54:39.170 --> 02:54:39.890]
You know what I'm gonna ask you?

[02:54:41.130 --> 02:54:42.070]
You know what I'm gonna ask you?

[02:54:42.070 --> 02:54:42.070]

[02:54:42.070 --> 02:54:43.730]
You know what I'm gonna ask you?

[02:54:44.670 --> 02:54:46.230]
You know what I'm gonna ask you?

[02:54:47.410 --> 02:54:49.650]
You know what I'm gonna ask you?

[02:54:50.290 --> 02:54:53.310]
You know what I'm gonna ask you?

[02:54:53.310 --> 02:55:00.770]
You know what I'm gonna ask you?

[02:55:01.370 --> 02:55:02.650]
Oh, oh, oh.

[02:55:02.650 --> 02:55:03.190]
I'm gonna ask you.

[02:55:03.190 --> 02:55:04.710]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[02:55:04.810 --> 02:55:07.030]
You know, it's my pleasure.

[02:55:07.350 --> 02:55:08.650]
So what was you really trying to say?

[02:55:08.850 --> 02:55:09.550]
It was a good one.

[02:55:09.570 --> 02:55:09.950]
Oh, okay.

[02:55:10.210 --> 02:55:10.490]
Kendall.

[02:55:10.610 --> 02:55:10.770]
Hello.

[02:55:11.270 --> 02:55:12.430]
Hello, how you doing?

[02:55:12.650 --> 02:55:12.790]
Great.

[02:55:13.210 --> 02:55:15.430]
Listen, you're always talking about black people.

[02:55:15.650 --> 02:55:16.890]
You're always talking about religion.

[02:55:17.250 --> 02:55:17.750]
You're always talking about religion.

[02:55:18.110 --> 02:55:18.110]

[02:55:18.330 --> 02:55:18.550]
You're always talking about religion.

[02:55:18.550 --> 02:55:18.550]

[02:55:18.550 --> 02:55:18.950]
About women.

[02:55:19.510 --> 02:55:21.150]
And when you talk about something about yourself,

[02:55:21.490 --> 02:55:22.350]
you'll be so s******.

[02:55:22.630 --> 02:55:24.090]
Okay, I guess we'll be doing that tomorrow.

[02:55:24.390 --> 02:55:25.090]
When you're feeling lucky,

[02:55:25.210 --> 02:55:27.550]
why not make a B-line for Hollywood Seminogem and that's what...

[02:55:28.750 --> 02:55:30.090]
You can't allow that baby.

[02:55:31.770 --> 02:55:37.290]
The New Rogers on Sports, Holes, A, D, O, W, Q, A, S.

[02:55:39.390 --> 02:55:40.350]
See, that's another thing.

[02:55:40.410 --> 02:55:41.790]
I always complain we don't have enough jails.

[02:55:41.890 --> 02:55:43.250]
We don't have enough prisons in the US.

[02:55:43.250 --> 02:55:47.010]
The US has a higher percentage of its population in jail or prison than any other so-called

[02:55:47.010 --> 02:55:47.950]
civilized countries in the world.

[02:55:48.370 --> 02:55:51.310]
Well, if they'd let all the people out who are like in there for, you know, to have enough

[02:55:51.310 --> 02:55:55.670]
huge joints, all the people who are in prison for victimless crimes, if they put them all

[02:55:55.670 --> 02:55:57.010]
out, we'd have plenty of room.

[02:55:57.050 --> 02:55:58.750]
We wouldn't have to waste any more money building more prisons.

[02:55:58.750 --> 02:56:02.730]
And if they would keep them in there, like that Rimmer scumbag, they'd let out a couple

[02:56:02.730 --> 02:56:03.190]
weeks or not.

[02:56:03.290 --> 02:56:06.170]
They're a hockey guy, not him, different Rimmer, with two M's.

[02:56:06.490 --> 02:56:10.410]
The guy that, you know, that went to the electronics store and off the couple of people,

[02:56:10.550 --> 02:56:14.490]
a couple of kids, because his probation officer had too heavy of a workload and she just

[02:56:14.490 --> 02:56:16.670]
has a habit of like letting everybody just on the loose.

[02:56:17.250 --> 02:56:19.510]
But we don't have any serious commitment toward this.

[02:56:19.670 --> 02:56:20.810]
There is no serious commitment.

[02:56:20.950 --> 02:56:21.950]
We don't care about this.

[02:56:22.390 --> 02:56:26.410]
And as long as they leave us alone, like Howard Diel said, as long as it isn't us, we

[02:56:26.410 --> 02:56:27.250]
don't give a flying craft.

[02:56:27.250 --> 02:56:28.910]
There's a lady mobile in Western.

[02:56:29.070 --> 02:56:29.210]
Hello.

[02:56:29.650 --> 02:56:30.930]
Hi, good morning, Neil.

[02:56:31.070 --> 02:56:31.470]
When is this?

[02:56:31.870 --> 02:56:33.330]
I got a few things to comment.

[02:56:33.550 --> 02:56:33.790]
OK.

[02:56:34.150 --> 02:56:36.350]
Number one, only in America, this should happen.

[02:56:36.910 --> 02:56:38.270]
OK, don't show you a crap again.

[02:56:38.470 --> 02:56:38.710]
OK.

[02:56:39.490 --> 02:56:42.830]
Number two, this kid is old enough to be tried as an adult.

[02:56:42.990 --> 02:56:43.170]
Yeah.

[02:56:43.770 --> 02:56:45.970]
But I don't know how you feel about the death penalty.

[02:56:46.210 --> 02:56:46.610]
I like it.

[02:56:46.810 --> 02:56:47.590]
This is the kicker.

[02:56:47.870 --> 02:56:48.070]
Yeah.

[02:56:48.170 --> 02:56:49.850]
He's old enough to be tried as an adult.

[02:56:49.850 --> 02:56:50.450]
You will be.

[02:56:50.890 --> 02:56:53.010]
But he's not old enough to go for the death penalty.

[02:56:53.190 --> 02:56:53.410]
Mm-hmm.

[02:56:53.670 --> 02:56:54.270]
Go figure.

[02:56:54.270 --> 02:56:54.670]
Yeah.

[02:56:54.790 --> 02:56:58.090]
And now the last thing, which will bring a smile to your face and you'll probably crack

[02:56:58.090 --> 02:56:58.330]
out.

[02:56:58.430 --> 02:57:00.430]
This is medical news that just broke out.

[02:57:01.110 --> 02:57:07.390]
For all the women who are PMS and this gynecologist came out with something so they won't get

[02:57:07.390 --> 02:57:07.950]
cramps.

[02:57:08.590 --> 02:57:12.950]
He puts a battery in the box of a, they're going to be sold by boxes.

[02:57:13.230 --> 02:57:15.210]
It's a vibrating tampon.

[02:57:15.770 --> 02:57:16.230]
Oh, right.

[02:57:16.430 --> 02:57:17.010]
I've seen that.

[02:57:17.690 --> 02:57:19.610]
They're waiting for FDA approval.

[02:57:19.710 --> 02:57:23.670]
In fact, Jeff Cohen is going to be first in line to get him and I for his wife either.

[02:57:25.450 --> 02:57:28.790]
I just fell off the couch and the news reported that he said, no, we're going to have a bunch

[02:57:28.790 --> 02:57:32.330]
of women walking around town with the vibrator there.

[02:57:32.690 --> 02:57:35.170]
Well, you think you were falling off the couch now just wait till it comes out.

[02:57:35.410 --> 02:57:36.930]
I know we're going to have a lot of car accidents.

[02:57:36.930 --> 02:57:39.850]
They're going to ditch their husbands and they're going to be ragged for the whole month.

[02:57:40.050 --> 02:57:41.530]
At least to keep them busy in the car anyway.

[02:57:41.670 --> 02:57:42.350]
Have a good day sweetheart.

[02:57:42.690 --> 02:57:42.910]
Thanks.

[02:57:43.190 --> 02:57:43.370]
Bye-bye.

[02:57:43.890 --> 02:57:44.610]
Can't you just see that?

[02:57:44.970 --> 02:57:46.730]
All the crazy things that people do in cars now.

[02:57:47.210 --> 02:57:49.830]
How about a pencil thin anal vibrator with every new car?

[02:57:51.890 --> 02:57:53.110]
Sure, make Jeff Cohen happy.

[02:57:53.110 --> 02:57:55.370]
He's heavy duty in those pencil thin,

[02:57:55.470 --> 02:57:59.070]
rectum vibrators and he's straight as an arrow well on him.

[02:57:59.430 --> 02:58:02.710]
We got trailer part like I told you this story a couple days ago about the woman in Walgreens

[02:58:02.710 --> 02:58:04.650]
with the two little kids running around.

[02:58:04.750 --> 02:58:09.710]
I mean, just trashing the place, just destroying, ripping the stuff off registers

[02:58:09.710 --> 02:58:13.710]
and just opening up all kinds of crap and throwing it on the floor oblivious.

[02:58:14.290 --> 02:58:17.310]
So when you turn on shows like Jerry Sprung and you think, boy, they're sure going to run

[02:58:17.310 --> 02:58:19.290]
out of that trailer park trash pretty soon for all of it.

[02:58:19.370 --> 02:58:19.670]
Don't worry.

[02:58:19.750 --> 02:58:22.590]
There's an endless supply because they're reproducing

[02:58:22.590 --> 02:58:23.530]
like rabbits.

[02:58:24.250 --> 02:58:28.170]
And the meantime here in Miami, they're at doing acid attacks on abortion clinics.

[02:58:28.630 --> 02:58:31.290]
That's what we do it because we love those fetuses.

[02:58:31.610 --> 02:58:35.630]
Those people, by the way, are the same ones, the right wingers who are hysterical about abortions,

[02:58:35.910 --> 02:58:39.910]
the same ones who are the gun lovers and the same ones who don't give a flying crap

[02:58:39.910 --> 02:58:42.910]
about the kids that got murdered yesterday or any other kids once they're born.

[02:58:43.210 --> 02:58:44.370]
They are fetus huggers.

[02:58:45.530 --> 02:58:48.250]
They're hugging their gun with one hand and they're hugging their fetus with the other.

[02:58:49.190 --> 02:58:50.070]
They're all shooted.

[02:58:50.410 --> 02:58:51.290]
Here's a lady in Kendall.

[02:58:51.430 --> 02:58:51.590]
Hello?

[02:58:52.310 --> 02:58:53.070]
Hey, I'm Neil.

[02:58:53.390 --> 02:58:53.790]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:58:54.090 --> 02:58:56.570]
Finally, honey, after three years of trying to get you.

[02:58:56.810 --> 02:58:57.450]
Well, here I am.

[02:58:57.550 --> 02:58:58.250]
I know that you need me.

[02:58:58.250 --> 02:58:59.470]
Haven't had an open line in three years.

[02:58:59.610 --> 02:59:00.730]
An encandled, too, honey.

[02:59:01.050 --> 02:59:03.550]
Yeah, but I'm living in the Candle area.

[02:59:04.050 --> 02:59:05.910]
And I'm still trying to figure out where the hell I'm at.

[02:59:06.370 --> 02:59:06.590]
Yeah.

[02:59:07.330 --> 02:59:08.110]
We'll send you a roadmap.

[02:59:08.390 --> 02:59:09.150]
I know I need one.

[02:59:09.290 --> 02:59:09.670]
And a compass.

[02:59:09.930 --> 02:59:12.770]
I know my husband's trying to tell me, well, honey, you're on this road.

[02:59:12.950 --> 02:59:14.610]
And a pencil thin anal vibrator from the people.

[02:59:14.610 --> 02:59:14.830]
Exactly.

[02:59:15.050 --> 02:59:15.890]
Oh, hey, I would love that.

[02:59:16.010 --> 02:59:16.310]
All right.

[02:59:16.730 --> 02:59:17.070]
That's right.

[02:59:18.350 --> 02:59:18.630]
And...

[02:59:19.410 --> 02:59:21.010]
Just calling just gave it thumbs up.

[02:59:21.170 --> 02:59:22.510]
I said it's in the mail, sweetheart.

[02:59:22.650 --> 02:59:23.910]
Ooh, I'll take it.

[02:59:24.270 --> 02:59:24.610]
Let's see.

[02:59:25.230 --> 02:59:26.590]
I didn't go out my buy-be.

[02:59:26.850 --> 02:59:28.110]
I just felt like I had to say that.

[02:59:29.270 --> 02:59:30.530]
I'm just still using tail mill.

[02:59:30.750 --> 02:59:31.090]
Let me take...

[02:59:31.090 --> 02:59:31.610]
Sounds like it.

[02:59:32.610 --> 02:59:33.470]
Better you've georg your address.

[02:59:33.630 --> 02:59:34.610]
You want to stop buying a weekend.

[02:59:34.790 --> 02:59:35.750]
It's in good stuff for the holiday.

[02:59:36.010 --> 02:59:36.850]
Well, come on in for baby.

[02:59:36.990 --> 02:59:37.290]
All right.

[02:59:37.650 --> 02:59:38.410]
Hey, man, take something.

[02:59:38.590 --> 02:59:39.390]
I would take care of you.

[02:59:39.450 --> 02:59:39.990]
I've got an empty room here.

[02:59:39.990 --> 02:59:41.390]
I think this lady's got the really good.

[02:59:41.750 --> 02:59:41.910]
Yeah.

[02:59:42.150 --> 02:59:42.510]
That's right.

[02:59:42.690 --> 02:59:43.130]
Oh, God.

[02:59:43.170 --> 02:59:43.590]
I need that.

[02:59:43.690 --> 02:59:44.690]
I haven't sh** in three weeks.

[02:59:44.690 --> 02:59:49.150]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[02:59:49.450 --> 02:59:50.270]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[02:59:50.270 --> 02:59:50.270]

[02:59:50.930 --> 02:59:53.830]
Oh, the best call in the history of the human race.

[02:59:54.070 --> 02:59:54.850]
Not just of this show.

[02:59:54.990 --> 02:59:55.790]
Not just talk radio.

[02:59:56.150 --> 02:59:57.330]
That was the best call call.

[02:59:57.430 --> 02:59:59.570]
Even Alexander Graham Schwartz would be impressed with that.

[02:59:59.670 --> 02:59:59.990]
That was...

[02:59:59.990 --> 03:00:00.370]
Go home now.

[03:00:00.430 --> 03:00:00.890]
I've got to take it.

[03:00:00.990 --> 03:00:04.430]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[03:00:04.650 --> 03:00:05.650]
Oh, God.

[03:00:05.950 --> 03:00:06.590]
I needed a good laugh.

[03:00:07.030 --> 03:00:07.650]
It pains me.

[03:00:08.110 --> 03:00:09.190]
Here's a mobile and crawl spring.

[03:00:09.330 --> 03:00:09.510]
Hello?

[03:00:10.130 --> 03:00:10.530]
Hey, Neil.

[03:00:10.690 --> 03:00:11.290]
God, how you doing?

[03:00:11.650 --> 03:00:11.650]

[03:00:12.210 --> 03:00:15.530]
uh... jet bush is uh...

[03:00:15.530 --> 03:00:17.190]
speaking of my son elementary school today

[03:00:17.190 --> 03:00:19.710]

i sent in the class with a question

[03:00:26.050 --> 03:00:29.010]
uh... because my son uh... will probably get to ask the question

[03:00:29.010 --> 03:00:32.970]
i said it when you become or if you become uh... leader now governor

[03:00:33.490 --> 03:00:36.050]

uh... what

[03:00:45.690 --> 03:00:49.130]
uh... you were to read the papers because my son will probably ask the question

[03:00:49.130 --> 03:00:53.010]

[03:00:53.010 --> 03:00:53.310]

[03:00:57.430 --> 03:00:58.870]
are you don't know the level

[03:00:58.870 --> 03:01:02.610]
