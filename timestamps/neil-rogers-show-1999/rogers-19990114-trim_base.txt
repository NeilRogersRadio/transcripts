Radio 560, WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.540]
You'll call 567-0560 toll-free for date and rarer.

[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.880]
Oh, no, 560 in yourself, oh.

[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.580]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers, or anyone else on the show do not necessarily

[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.440]
reflect those of WQAM, easily read acquisitions, or the Beasley Broadcast Group.

[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.520]
No, Neil Rogers on Sports Radio 560, QAM.

[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.700]
I see you do, but nothing resets me

[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.060]
And it ain't like this, it ain't like you, but it's all

[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.160]

[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.060]
Let's you do like me that you kinda catch me

[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.060]
It could be some juices like insane

[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.900]
Or a buffa cup, a buffa cup

[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.240]
Obviously you're living not....

[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.360]
It's them like my dashes rest

[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.360]
I'm only a shadow too while selecting

[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.020]
My seconds come to one

[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.020]
What is for you, all?

[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.260]

[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.940]

[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.980]
A fabo lot

[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.380]
Stupidly, it's a princip

[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.400]
All the power to do is just say you should be able to do it.

[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.180]
All the power to do it.

[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.240]
All the power to do it.

[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.140]
Thank you for listening to the New York.

[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.300]
Can I want a 560 WQM?

[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.260]
It's an amazing Thursday, boys and girls.

[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.380]
Wow, yes, Virginia, there is a press conference.

[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.420]
And will we carry it?

[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.560]
Well, before we get to that, let's read this fact

[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.580]
that we got from Peter this morning alleged,

[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.500]
which I'm sure that's a phony name, but nevertheless,

[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.620]
because nobody this stupid would put a real name on it,

[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.520]
even just the first name.

[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.760]
Neil, I am a Paul spelled APP A-U-L-L-E-D.

[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.020]
I am up at Pollard that you didn't carry the press conference

[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.800]
or Michael Jordan.

[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.080]
Jordan is someone who can speak properly.

[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.860]
He is intelligent.

[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.320]
One of the greatest basketball players who played for 13 years,

[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.380]
who was an icon in someone of high-statury known all over the world.

[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.720]
You arrogant, egotistical idiot, won't allow us to hear his press conference.

[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.300]
If you didn't want to listen, you should have gone home and leave George to complete the show.

[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.520]
Yeah, George would have been real angry.

[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.320]
Oh, right.

[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.740]
He was hot to try to put that crap on, right?

[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.020]
No.

[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.260]
No.

[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.320]
Today you had better carried the Jimmy Johnson's press conference.

[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.640]
Boy, you are so illiterate, Peter.

[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.280]
So the one you want to hear about you dumb jokes.

[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.060]
You had better carry underlying the Jimmy Johnson's press conference.

[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.340]
Who do you think you are?

[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.940]
I think I'm...

[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.560]
You're good.

[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.140]
Probably.

[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.380]
You must be miserable.

[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.980]
Am I miserable?

[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.380]
No.

[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.460]
You dislike everyone and everything.

[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.740]
No.

[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.900]
You don't like football or basketball wrong.

[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.620]
I do watch a lot of football as a matter of fact.

[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.060]
Not as much as I used to because quite frankly a lot of it's boring.

[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.260]
And basketball you're right.

[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.740]
I don't like it.

[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.800]
A bunch of seven foot freaks.

[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.980]
This is your rights.

[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.080]
That is your rights.

[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.160]
Peter, you are so illiterate.

[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.040]
You must be the one that's miserable and must look at the mirror and say,

[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.720]
God am I dumb.

[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.460]
Are you dumb?

[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.860]
Yes.

[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.420]
Why do you want to deprive us of listening to a press conference?

[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.960]
I dare you to read this on the air.

[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.900]
Reason is the fact that you are gutless.

[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.480]
Well, how do you like that, Peter?

[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.460]

[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.740]
The Panthers made a great comeback there.

[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.400]
Sparked by Ray Whitney in the third period.

[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.320]
The fact that the Maple Leaves were like out of gas.

[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.560]
Too many games in two few nights.

[00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.620]
But we don't make excuses.

[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.360]
We'll take the tie.

[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:00.780]
Thank you.

[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.220]
But again, the Panthers.

[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.960]
Fifth time in a row.

[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.740]
They made a nice comeback.

[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.080]
Ray Whitney sparked the comeback with the first goal.

[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.220]
After that, they won fire.

[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.080]
And Leafs were our gasping for oxygen.

[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.380]
Although I will say this.

[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.940]
And you know, Maple Leaf fans, we don't cry.

[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.280]
And we don't moan like some of the other fans about the officiating.

[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.480]
But the third in the time goal, it was offside.

[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.980]
Then he pulled it out over the blue line.

[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.660]
And interestingly enough, some of us,

[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.500]
they're all around me.

[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.180]
We heard a whistle.

[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.860]
It must have been some jackass in the stand.

[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.300]
And I sat back in my seat thinking, OK, it's offside.

[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.860]
The play is over.

[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.860]
Next thing I know, I look up the puckies in the net.

[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.880]
The crowd is on their feet.

[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.280]
They're screaming.

[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.880]
The game is tied.

[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.500]
I'm thinking, wait a minute.

[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:32.520]
That was offside.

[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.200]
But like I said, we make no excuses.

[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.040]
We ran out of gas.

[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.340]
And the Panthers did their credit came back and tied it up.

[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.420]
So everybody went home happy with the point last time.

[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.460]
Torenda's game.

[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.500]
Too bad there were like 5,000 empty seats.

[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.860]
This morning's papers will tell you the official attendance,

[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.540]
which includes a season ticket sold, 17,500 in some odd.

[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.340]
But the actual number of seats the people through the turnstiles,

[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.120]
and I know this for a fact from people on the inside,

[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.920]
was about 14,500.

[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.840]
And if all the teams in the league for some strange reason,

[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.380]
when the Leafs come down here, they don't draw.

[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.180]
They don't draw.

[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.720]
The most cool of any team in the league this year,

[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.080]
certainly one of the two or three most exciting teams in the league,

[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.480]
does that make a difference to these people?

[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:11.680]
No.

[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.280]
No, do not.

[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.040]
They don't draw.

[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.600]
And by the way, the people in front of me, the baby people,

[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.760]
weren't there last night.

[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:19.660]
God bless you.

[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.580]
Thank you so much.

[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.360]
Everybody in my section was well behaved on their best behavior.

[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.220]
I saw the whole game.

[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:24.940]
No problem.

[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.880]
We had 8 billion people come by and say hello.

[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.920]
The only one who acted a little bit bizarre and aberrant was unacceptable,

[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.360]
because we're not impressed by you standing in the aisle with your cell phone

[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.640]
while the game is going on, was Lenny the limo driver.

[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.120]
Which a couple of guys finally screamed at him.

[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.340]
Hey, sit down and ask the whole other game is going on.

[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.920]
He all of a sudden speaked in there and sat down.

[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.100]
Lenny, we're not impressed.

[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:44.760]
You're a good guy.

[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.880]
You're who you are.

[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.760]
You have a great limo service.

[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.380]
And also Ken's got a great limo service to McKenzie.

[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.740]
And this guest today apologizing profusely for that jackass that they're called Tuesday.

[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.180]
Ken, at all points, limo-zene services.

[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:57.800]
Great guy.

[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.780]
In fact, such a good guy that he didn't got other people impersonating him on the air,

[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.680]
which was the first on it.

[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.620]
All the years I've done a show.

[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.900]
That's the first that we ever had anybody calling in impersonating a limo driver.

[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.900]
So you ought to be honored, Ken.

[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.760]
That anybody takes you that seriously and that is that jealous I guess.

[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.680]
Maybe it was Lenny, I don't know.

[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.220]
But anyway, other than let me limo-driver, everybody was on their best behavior.

[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.680]
We turned into a scintillating game.

[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.160]
And again, the Panthers played only one period, the third period.

[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.340]
But nevertheless, turned into a terrific battle.

[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.960]
And two bad over 5,000 MTC.

[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.820]
The greatest column.

[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.360]
I thought the one about Leavon and about the fact that Dan La Bastard.

[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.260]
Oh, he was Cuban.

[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.020]
It was us.

[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:35.800]
We won the World Series.

[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.160]
I thought that was the worst article I've ever written in my life.

[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.100]
But the one today, the one this morning,

[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.380]
please Jimmy, reconsider and stay of the headline by Dan La Bastard and the Miami Hero.

[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.900]
This article could have been easily written by a five-year-old child.

[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.600]
Or by someone who has the emotional maturity level of, like I said, a two-year-old child.

[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.860]
Nine minutes after 10, we'll be hearing a Jimmy Johnson press conference from pillar to post.

[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.280]
As soon as it happens, you'll hear it.

[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.740]
On the bottom, I was afraid we'd be able to read the facts again.

[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.380]
That was pretty good, Peter.

[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.240]
You're a bastard.

[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.380]
I know someone like to do the sandwich or two.

[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:16.640]
Eight months that skinny chick, the skinnyest chick I know.

[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.820]
You do just bleak, that heroine's feet.

[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.660]
You got to lay off the blow.

[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:27.140]
Eight months that skinny chick, we want to know what's the deal.

[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.120]
To close the trap when you're in rehab.

[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.460]
You're worse than Ali McVeal.

[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.600]
14 at 5.50 WQM.

[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:40.100]
So getting back to Jimmy and all this shock and amazement here, the fact that he's going to resign and announce it in about 45 minutes or thereabouts.

[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.000]
Now you can look at this any way you want.

[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.620]
You can look at it from, you know, he says that he's got to spend more time with his family.

[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.680]
He's basically, don't want the pressures of all this BS anymore.

[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.900]
He wants to change the direction of his life, his mother died a short time ago.

[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.800]
His father's fighting cancer, he's on chemo, et cetera, and so on.

[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.980]
You can believe that and accept that as being the only reason he wants to leave.

[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:05.980]
Peter King of CNN, I thought this morning said that basically things, Jimmy doesn't see the players being motivated the way that they used to be when he was with Dallas

[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.420]
and how they just, they don't have the vacation and motivation.

[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:13.060]
And it's just too much of an effort to try each week, week after week to motivate them to get out there and play.

[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:13.880]
That's part of the reason.

[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.700]
Then of course there's the business about, you know, being thin skinned and doesn't like the media criticism, et cetera, and so on.

[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.860]
Which of course, if you don't like the media criticism, it's the wrong profession to be in.

[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:22.800]
But I will say this.

[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:29.500]
And I did listen this morning coming in because obviously this is a major story and needless to say it's one day when I have to be listening to what I want to or not.

[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.660]
And listening to the callers that called in and the Venom and the Hosta, it really, there are no gray areas.

[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:42.100]
There are no human areas here. In other words, maybe this is a guy who just fed up and he's got plenty of money, he don't need the money, et cetera.

[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.460]
I made just this amount of do this anymore. There is none of that.

[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:51.200]
There is either people like Dan LaBaster who are such emotional cripples that they're on the verge of tears and having an nervous breakdown

[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.580]
because the football coach is going to resign or the majority of the calls that I heard and I've heard about a half an hour.

[00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:03.320]
The majority of them were like venomous and while we knew when he came here, he was a piece of crap and just ripping him a major ass.

[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:13.380]
Now like I said, if you're not emotionally prepared to handle that and you don't want to take that anymore along with the other stuff that goes on, then you're in the wrong business because it goes with the territory.

[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:25.180]
But you have seen it, especially during this past season, the only one press conference early in the season when he chewed the hell out of the press just absolutely went bananas.

[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:34.020]
And then of course the situation with this radio station and calling in on the morning show and then getting up the thing with Bo Camparaniere, the guy is very thin, he's a hothead.

[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:41.660]
And unfortunately, hell of a lot of people in coaching positions like the Marie Boers, they're a couple of hotheads, is what they are.

[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:53.980]
Can take no criticism and I don't understand that if you're going to be a public figure like that, if you're going to go out there and put on a show for the public and expect them to subsidize it and emotionally and tangibly support it, you got to have to have their skin on that.

[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.680]
But at the same time, is it going to change our lives?

[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:11.500]
No, I don't think so. But it's fascinating to me since this is the anti-sport show, since we get some of these factions like the one I just had from Eliterate Peter and some of these other morons, the Jacksonifers.

[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:22.600]
I was the one that told you two weeks ago, beyond a shadow of a doubt when it was told to me directly by somebody who knows beyond a shadow of doubt that Dan Marie knowing Jimmy Johnson despises each other.

[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:30.480]
And then I'm coming to work this morning for the first time on one of the other shows on this station. I actually hear that being said, not in language that strong.

[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:39.740]
But I hear it being hinted that they really aren't on the same page and they're not fond of each other and yadi yadi yadi et cetera and so on, which is maybe a couple of weeks, a few weeks ago.

[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:47.340]
When everybody was saying, well, you know, Jimmy didn't make such a big deal about Dan setting that record touchdown pass et cetera and so on.

[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:58.800]
Well, they don't like each other. They despise each other. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised even though I'm sure he can't admit it publicly that Dan Marino right now is dancing a kazansky. He's probably jumping up and down up there in Weston or wherever he is.

[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.780]
For joy, because he doesn't like Jimmy Johnson.

[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:11.400]
I mean, and how many times have I told you people called in and want me to talk about that stuff. He hasn't shown me that much since he came here.

[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:20.340]
He's improved the defense. They got a tremendous defense, but you know something you got to be able to score points and this fan and business of developing a running game. There wasn't any running game.

[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.280]
There never was a running game when they played against a good team.

[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:31.340]
So he really didn't show me that much, but life is going to go on. It's not like the end of the world, but you read this Dan LaBasse.

[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:38.760]
You think that this is sensational. Please Jimmy reconsider and say it's I'm not going to read much of it, but it's just it's pathetic.

[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.200]
It's written by somebody who sounds like an emotional cripple.

[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.880]
It starts out by saying is it true? Can it be?

[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.340]
Uh-huh.

[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:55.560]
Jimmy Johnson is resigning. That's the word that started spreading it about 10 p.m. Wednesday night, crackling like a lit fuse.

[00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:02.640]
Making its way from the dolphins front office to the dolphins coaches to the dolphin players, causing an explosion everywhere it hit.

[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.440]
Like it hit the fan.

[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:18.860]
All we can hope is that it isn't true that Johnson just had one of his momentary mind melting like he did after the hurricane's 1987 fiesta bull loss and that he's just temporarily sour because he takes losing so, so hard.

[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.560]
How do you like that? Is that is that emotional or what?

[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.400]
It is so hard.

[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:32.940]
Oh, Danny LaBasse, you are a baske out of I was going to say a basket case, you're a bastard case.

[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:39.660]
And then at the end of the economy, if I can find it very way here in the hero's fourth section somewhere in the middle of the middle of all the important stories.

[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:46.960]
Um, not that I blame JJ if he does go back to that life, heck, he just became dramatically underpaid.

[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:55.460]
Mike Hombin doing the same job in Seattle just got double the paycheck. Heck, former coach John Madden makes five times with Johnson does just for describing other men's coaching.

[00:15:55.460 --> 00:16:02.240]
Please Jimmy, reconsider the dolphins need you so very much clearly more than you need them.

[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:13.980]
Is that not doesn't that scare you? I mean, this is an adult writing in what is supposedly the superior newspaper here in South Florida.

[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:20.060]
Certainly the best known in America much more so than some federal. The Miami hero, the software claim prestigious Miami hero.

[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:32.900]
Here's an adult writing this. Oh, now I don't know not the kids of America. Okay, little kids, little infants, I think are far more mature and prepared to handle the hazards of life like maybe the coach of your football team, you're signing.

[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:39.720]
I mean, your coaches like as soon as the season ended, their coaches getting fired and quitting and going here in my home room leaves.

[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:47.620]
Pack the packers to go off the Seattle. I mean, it happens. I hate to break the news to you, Dan. You're better lock yourself in, brace yourself real tight.

[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:56.280]
It does happen coaches quit. Players resign after they get their first 10 billion dollars like Michael Jordan. Players resign.

[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.180]
Oh, no, how is life possibly going to go on for us now?

[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:12.140]
I mean, this is the classic. This really is. I'm going to save this. I'm going to frame it. Please, please, we beg you.

[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:17.320]
And of course, this coming from the same media that I've been dicing him up for the last several months now since back in August.

[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.980]
Just dicing and slicing and ripping and tearing and etc and so on.

[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:36.000]
Which of course, that's their prerogative. I mean, you're going to have to take that. If you want to be in that position, you have to take the good with the band. If they're going to splice you up so beat you can't have thin skin and be a professional coach or manager in sports. You just can't do it.

[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.060]
Like Pat Riley would say if he can't stand the heat and go follow some other team, that's what he said.

[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:50.900]
Okay, let's get some real serious input on this here now because I know obviously from here what I heard this morning, the town is full of shock and venom and psychosis.

[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:56.260]
I mean, this is obviously even more important. And of course, I guess you didn't want to be upstage by Michael Jordan to run. I mean, who the hell is he?

[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.300]
So he's going to show him a thing or two today. And we'll have the press conference for you. Don't panic. We'll have it, Peter.

[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:14.760]
In fact, maybe between now and the press conference starts, you can start taking some lessons in something. Open up a dictionary, learn a couple of words, add to your vocabulary. Maybe a couple of spelling lessons might help because I am appalled by your facts.

[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:23.620]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the prestigious mobile one line. Here's dear field. Hello. Hello, no.

[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:36.980]
Yes. Well, first off, I don't think that it's going to make any big difference to us. I really enjoy watching you play. Well, I'll be well because I'm not Dan LeBasterd. I'll get on with it and we'll get another coach.

[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:48.440]
And I personally think that Johnson will take a year off and then wind up on another team. That's one thing. And also, I feel that Dan Marinos' resignation will probably happen before next season.

[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:58.280]
Why is that? I just don't feel that he's going to go the whole next year. I didn't see it this year. He did great, but I don't know if he's willing to start.

[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:15.980]
Well, let me ask you a little bit. Realistically, how many more years can he play? LeBasterd in this article, he must have been unassured when he wrote it, he says, well, maybe this happened. Part of it could be, DeDen is Wayne Hypinger going to sign Dan Marino to a long-term contract. Long-term. How long is he supposed to play to? He's 45 years old? What is this man thinking about?

[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:21.260]
Well, I'm in a walker, they'll bring him out. Exactly. They're going to have to bring him out there to have to borrow Larry Flint's wheelchair to wheel him out there.

[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:31.300]
Either that or Marino is going to go to the highest bidder or just maybe he doesn't need the money, he will go to a super bowl team next year. That could possibly happen to. Those are my things.

[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:37.000]
And I know those two didn't get along and it was evident. It wasn't just that they didn't get along to despise each other bitterly.

[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.800]
And that's the hardest thing to do because they're both have a lot of pride and they just want to go their own way.

[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.760]
Yeah, okay. And on the top of all of it is Wayne Hyzinga so you can imagine what's going on behind the scenes.

[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:58.240]
Oh yeah. Thanks, Neil. A lot of zits flying all over the place. Zit hit the fan. Thank you, sir. Open line in Broward to and date, 56670560, 0560 on the mobile one line. Here's Boca. Hello.

[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.440]
Hey, Neil. First of all, you're the greatest. Yes, I am.

[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:08.360]
When's that press conference? I just got the tail end of it coming up around 11 o'clock or whenever Jimmy's good and ready.

[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:12.300]
We'll let you know. We'll have it. We won't miss a word. What about TV? You know, what about what?

[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.560]
Is it going to be on TV? Sure. Of course. Okay.

[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:19.720]
You like me. I mean, I'm only ghost. Huh? He's going to be like Michael Jordan yesterday. No, he's going to be more.

[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:29.700]
No, see the difference being it's Michael Jordan was anti climactic. Everybody knew he was going to retire. There was nothing exciting about sitting listening and talk for an hour about how he was going to have more time with his kids.

[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:35.940]
Yeah, but what was that? Everybody knew he was retiring. They loved him. He was great. Okay. We have a great life. We wish you the best.

[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:41.540]
But this is like out of nowhere. You know, so it's a major happening. The major. Right. This is major. Yeah.

[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:47.300]
It's happening here. So obviously we ought to be interested in since it's an open station. We ought to demo. Be interested in it.

[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:54.280]
So you think marino's history? Why would he be history? He ought to be ecstatic. No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying he's got a year or two left.

[00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:02.060]
I would say one, one maybe two at the outside, but you know, one more I would say realistically. Yeah, because they get a couple receive his out there.

[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:11.620]
You got to understand every game that he starts could be his last game. You do understand that. Don't you with the two bad knees? Every game that Danny boy starts could be the last one he plays. He's the greatest.

[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.900]
He is the greatest to me. I mean, he is the dolphin.

[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:28.020]
And well, I agree with that. I agree with what you just said has been for 15 or 16 years. But the fact is again, you listen to the sport shows on his station and the people trash him like he's he's supposed to provide an offense without any support.

[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:43.400]
No, he's without wide receivers without any running game and a court. Any of them. If they want to blues even if he has a sensational game. Well, it's Danny. He's too old. He's a statue. He's this. What he does. He is a statue. But he's got two bad knees. But in the meantime, you can't you can't blame any of the deficiencies of the past. He's not him.

[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:57.280]
No, he's a if he they get a good coach or somebody, you know, bring someone in and get a couple receivers. They're on their way. Is they got a great defense? Yeah. Great defense is great, but you can't you got to score some points. Yeah, they got no running.

[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:05.860]
Okay, have a great day. Okay, no. We have an open line of day one in Broward 5 6 7 0 5 60. 5 60 on the mobile one line is getting real.

Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:19.060]
he's he's very concerned about free agents and and not getting much out of him and

[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:24.340]
he's been talking to a lot of people about about that the other is that he has

[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:27.840]
not been happy with the South Florida media in the way they've been reporting a

[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.780]
lot of things that that he's been involved with particularly when Dan

[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:38.320]
Reno had his 400th touchdown pass and Jimmy didn't give him the accolades in his

[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:42.420]
post game press conference and then the newspapers and radio shows went after him

[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:47.760]
for that he was very unhappy about that in fact very disgusted about that and

[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:53.220]
the third thing was on the day when the five coaches were fired that Monday I

[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.900]
talked to him right after that and he was he was pretty upset he thought five

[00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:01.620]
really good coaches had lost their jobs and he started thinking very hard about

[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:06.960]
the profession so I think a lot of those things plus his mother's death and the

[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:11.020]
fact of his father was not dealing with that very well it brought him a little

[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:16.300]
closer to his family all those factors I think came to play and and so Jimmy walked

[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:20.500]
in that he Jones the club president's office yesterday and said that he wanted

[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:25.300]
to quit and that's when they summon Elaine and and of course they have to

[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:31.820]
meet this morning but he said he wanted to quit he he had not really technically

[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:38.520]
resigned and so I think that I think that when it was reported that he was leaving

[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:43.980]
it was just a few hours premature now Hank there was the talk that of that

[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.820]
Dan Marino is a working on a contract extension with the Adolphin's

[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:51.360]
management how was the relationship at least according to you know how between

[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:56.580]
Marino and Jimmy Johnson is Jimmy Johnson still firmly behind Dan Marino coming

[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.960]
back as the starter would that have anything to do with it I think he is on the

[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:03.720]
other hand there were times during the season where they didn't speak very much

[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:08.380]
so you know it's been somewhat rockier than perhaps they've either side is

[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:14.920]
let on but but the last month of the year Jimmy really felt strongly about how

[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:20.100]
well Dan had played and he was pretty vocal about that so they started talking

[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:24.960]
about extending Dan for two reasons one based on the fact that he felt so good

[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:30.760]
at the end of this the end of this year that he I think he has one more year on

[00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:35.590]
contract they're talking about extending it into the year 2001 and

[00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:39.430]
had accomplishes two things at three sub-sum cap room and also as a

[00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:43.790]
commitment to Dan to be the starting quarterback for at least another couple

[00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:49.590]
of years well I think we all know Jimmy Johnson is a proud man to say the least

[00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:53.590]
now this has got to be eating him up to look across and see Dan Reeves coming in

[00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:57.130]
and turning things around he had personal control bill par cells turning things

[00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:00.910]
around he had personal control Jimmy's got all that yet he's still struggling

[00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:06.170]
well he again he's very encouraged about this football team which is why I was

[00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:09.990]
a little bit surprised that here that he wanted to leave it you know I do his

[00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:15.150]
radio show with him and after the last show I asked him and this was before the

[00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:18.310]
Denver game if he felt that he was taking a better team than Denver then he

[00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:22.290]
took in the wing when the year ago and he said much better although this team

[00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:26.730]
was very banged up and he and he said that if you took away the injuries

[00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:30.790]
he felt real good about his team of course the defensive side of it and that

[00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:35.990]
he would not really address the defensive side during this offseason that all

[00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:41.130]
the floor focus would be on improving the offense to get a game breaking

[00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:45.710]
receiver to get a big back who could catch the ball and maybe one more mean

[00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:50.410]
offensive line and that's the direction that they'll go they have about four

[00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:54.750]
million dollars in cap room right now depending on what happens with Richmond

[00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:59.650]
wept they're all pro tackle who they have to sign but they've signed just about

[00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:03.630]
everybody they want to keep okay well it looks like so anyway they're announcing

[00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:06.470]
now it's not interesting they're putting the call on the screen on ESPN that

[00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:09.290]
they've learned that Jimmy Johnson is going to stay with the dolphins and former

[00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:12.670]
Bearshead coach they want that will come on board as a assistant coach and

[00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:18.010]
Yadi Yadi in there you are thanks thank God for hanging so like he said

[00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:21.070]
that he was very kind there it has come out to ESPN just maybe the rest of

[00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:24.890]
the media a little premature evaluation and everybody getting sucked into

[00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:28.370]
that because he said he wanted to quit but it wasn't officially yet so there we

[00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:31.810]
on the front page of the heraldis morning front page of the sun settle this

[00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:36.490]
morning the worst team psychotic all morning long as opposed to like waiting

[00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:39.350]
to eleven o'clock and seeing what he had to say like maybe he is and maybe he

[00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:43.270]
won't we don't want to do that doing no wait to see what he really has to say and

[00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:46.030]
if he really is going to be done no right away you know you get a little piece

[00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:49.370]
of material which again shows you the great responsibility of the print media

[00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:52.930]
in this town they are so incredibly consistent you name it and they can get it

[00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:57.330]
wrong the time of day they could get wrong whatever time it is when they put

[00:41:57.330 --> 00:42:01.590]
that the ragga there's out they can get that wrong on the mast head that could

[00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:04.010]
get the day of the week wrong whatever the issue was they're putting out that

[00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:07.070]
day because there's nothing ever been invented that they couldn't get wrong

[00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:11.510]
and they're holding the sun sent them so leave it to Hank nice going Hank baby

[00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:16.630]
out and spread those stupid press conferences here's a mobile in Miami hello

[00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:22.730]
a meal yes sir I had to do an adjullio calling for Miami yes sir I don't know you

[00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:25.590]
were at the game last night I know you didn't get to watch Larry Flint I think

[00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:31.270]
was on 2020 oh yeah it was pretty funny it's Sam Donaldson he's there they're

[00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:36.390]
um asking him if he thinks he's doing a good job Sam Donaldson he's an asshole yeah

[00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:39.670]
oh yeah no he's asking I don't think he's doing such a good job I mean in my opinion

[00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:43.630]
I think Larry Flint's voicing most of ours opinion which is what's going on

[00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:48.570]
here and should it be going on right and he's just bringing them down can I say hi

[00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:54.510]
to a couple friends sure Larry Scottie douchebag okay every great day oh sorry

[00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:58.050]
mr. Larry Flint well the hockey was pretty damn entertaining anyway we have an

[00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:00.910]
open line in day one and drivers minutes away from Jimmy Johnson's press

[00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:05.130]
conference but now it's kind of anti-climactic he's staying and you heard it

[00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:08.090]
here first thanks for Hank calling us first by the way and then going on a

[00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:12.710]

ass and Van La Bastille and all these other guys although maybe we ought to give

[00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:51.710]

[00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:47.250]
people talk to the people involved is opposed just sitting down and

[00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:50.010]
pop pop pop pop you know talking off the top of his head through his ass

[00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:52.670]
with so many of the people in this town do not to mention any names

[00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.090]
we're not to mention any sports writers

[00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:59.650]
just unbelievably embarrassing so we decided how we're gonna do this by the way

[00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:02.630]
I just I just mentioned that in passing and let me say it again thank god the

[00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:06.290]
Jeff Cohen and our satellite TV people because that's the only reason we got

[00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:09.150]
this stuff up here it's a year and two weeks that we've been here on this radio

[00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:12.310]
station and thank god to them that we have some contact with the outside world

[00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:18.190]
so that we can put that stuff on there so that's your question yes no oh so

[00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:20.990]
another day they haven't even bothered okay that's great nice going there

[00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:26.190]
tough you're the best baby so anyway we can pot it up here because it's right on

[00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:29.410]
ESPN in fact let's just pot it up right now because they're gonna go into the

[00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:32.850]
thing George just pot it up right now

[00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:37.170]
what is that

[00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:38.870]
let me have a look at the cameras you want

[00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.890]
let's see those seven

[00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:43.150]
yeah

[00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:53.190]
oh there's another one there

[00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:55.770]
don't blame us folks don't get bad

[00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:56.030]
you

[00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:01.590]
Jimmy Johnson he's a sickin around but they're having music in the guys look

[00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:04.810]
he looks like a senior wensers thought I thought I'd we could do better

[00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:07.510]
to learn music than this yeah right this is pretty weak music so they have a

[00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:08.990]
little bit of a problem are they taking that from

[00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:10.130]
on ESPN

[00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:17.690]
great what about the losers how about maybe ESPN okay well let's

[00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:19.970]
switch around here and the final what the hell is going on

[00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:23.610]
now there busy talking about unimportant stuff like the impeachment

[00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:25.730]
trial of the president nobody cares about that

[00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:30.490]
how about regular ESPN are they on top of this ago but the Jimmy has had

[00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:33.770]
that's how well that's great but we already heard what Hank has to say we want

[00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:37.330]
to hear when the Jimmy I guess uh what we'll do is we'll stick with ESPN and see if

[00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:40.210]
they can make maybe contact this is amazing this is unbelievable

[00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:45.250]
all the ESPN ones 206 207 to weigh it on the direct TV they've all got the same

[00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:48.450]
thing under Jimmy Johnson and Miami there's the dolphin logo and all these

[00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:50.690]
ponies who've been stabbed in the back by the way you're not going to be allowed

[00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:52.090]
in the stadium anymore how do you like that

[00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:55.830]
we've been tracing all the calls all these people at City was gutless and

[00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:58.270]
spineless and he abandoned them and he was a piece of crap you're out

[00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:02.150]
so people are looking for a season tickets now and they're going to be

[00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:04.990]
extending his contract and they're going to bring it in day once that

[00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:09.930]
I'd like goes on so how do you like that for a good old shot in the old

[00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:14.410]
rectum how do you like it huh what is that George what is it you're doing

[00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:17.150]
this radio station is amazing to me I mean you just talk about having

[00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:20.650]
absolutely no game plan no concept no uh don't

[00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:25.070]
worry the press conference being held do we like have somebody there no we

[00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:28.270]
have somebody down there like with a QM microphone every time I see these

[00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:33.390]
things on TV I see like a QAM you know logo on a microphone maybe it's just a

[00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:35.890]
prop maybe we don't really have somebody let me maybe we pay somebody five

[00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:39.730]
bucks I doubt that like I said maybe we pay somebody a buck and a half to go

[00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:43.670]
down there put the QAM logo on their microphone but in any way the

[00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:46.490]
Hank is the participating in going on to create lengths about this thing and

[00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:49.350]
as soon as Jimmy steps up there there he is there's Jimmy going ballistic on

[00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:52.530]
the sideline pair in a head set's off screaming and yelling and jumping over is

[00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:55.750]
what is it what is it 12 30 is the latest rumor

[00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:00.150]
from duct 12 30 and yes we do have someone out there

[00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:06.450]

[00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:15.870]
remember that can you get me off the hook time for old times sake no

[00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:20.730]

[00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:29.130]

[00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:03.510]
a room where you went to win paranoia from our local media and some other people who easily

[00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:21.250]
town interested in that they sent an impeachment trial of your president but that's not important anymore

[00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:24.990]
is it no i didn't think so anyway here's the fact that it's the gang initiation memo

[00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:29.210]
about shooting the first new flashes their lights at them is a hoax it's been urban myth

[00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:36.310]
for about eight years on and off so there you go it's a hit and miss also here's a

[00:59:36.310 --> 00:59:40.270]
fact from one of our chronic attorney factors who says i thought it was good of Peter to send you

[00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:44.470]
the facts from new haven you understand what that means by the way i don't get that but at any

[00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:48.390]
rate are you worried that Denise the pop-in missed last night are you aware of that uh

[00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:52.170]
and is missing tonight due to the flu uh rimmer said he's got the same thing Victor

Croswell have had that they must have had dinner together on the road or something together

[00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:58.870]
that what rimmer said they must have had something together uh they must have eaten uh

[00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:02.930]
finally it says wait till you see the rimmer randy i used to play at medicine square gardens

[01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:24.810]
Denise pop-in that frog we hope the frog gets better soon don't we know we certainly hope it's

[01:00:24.810 --> 01:00:28.930]
nothing serious like my you know hot skin in my neck which uh you know i did take my ad

[01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:33.090]
life by the way doc just in case you're listening and i'm not really too crazy about 154 over 95

[01:00:33.090 --> 01:00:37.610]
for blood pressure like early in the show because i would like to stay alive yes i do monitor these

[01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:42.010]
things very carefully and even my doctor or anybody else do i take their word for anything now i

[01:00:42.010 --> 01:00:45.690]
make sure i check out what's going on just to be uh you know i'm the safe side don't forget we

[01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:50.750]
got this date line guys you under the other oh that's right we got the date line guy well we got

[01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:54.530]
that once a day he's not on date line he just would like a date evidently from all you guys out

[01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:58.710]
this guy uh is a new chronic and of course these guys don't understand they're pretty damn stupid

[01:00:58.710 --> 01:01:04.410]
what's his phone ever 954 954 this is a guy who evidently uh is in a closet and keeps calling

[01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:07.990]
here bag it by animal with all kinds of stuff for me and George and anybody else you might talk

[01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:11.550]
this evidently is a closet guy who is really afraid to come out but has just been looking for

[01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:14.810]
companionship probably of the male variety what's his number any talk like this

[01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:21.350]
954 maybe you got something to smow seven nine two 954 seven nine two seven five nine seven seven

[01:01:21.350 --> 01:01:26.850]
five nine seven nine five four seven nine he's bigger than anal by the way he's one

[01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:32.890]
rectum yeah what do you say he's an asshole oh well obviously nine five four seven nine two

[01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:37.210]
seventy five ninety seven probably seven of them works that they heard his son set

[01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:41.790]
on with the guy maybe that's the problem because at first of all he works there he's an asshole

[01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:45.810]
because i mean Howard Kleinberg is a good guy and i used to like Bob Rubin to be for a pretended

[01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:49.350]
right and about hockey but other than that there's a few good people working with those two

[01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:53.730]
moose paper time jk he's okay huh i mean once in a while time isn't pretty good guy he's like

[01:01:53.730 --> 01:02:00.510]
on our side sometimes but other net he's okay so the press conference again if you're tuning in

[01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:03.570]
probably a lot of people gnashing their teeth and really pissed off that's probably you know

[01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:08.670]
who that probably was that probably was Peter by the way no seriously that must have been a

[01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:12.990]
literate Peter the fact that code you from nine five four seven nine two seventy five ninety seven

[01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:18.710]
maybe or maybe he was looking for Peter from the sound of it press conference at 1230 or

[01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:24.370]
there about see i have a feeling that what originally happened is that they you know he wanted he

[01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:28.210]
was thinking about resigning they set it up he was going to have the thing eleven o'clock this morning

[01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:32.250]
that's what they alerted the media to and then after he involved he a chat of this morning

[01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:36.470]
and they uh... you know got everything ironed out they have to push it back a little because now he's

[01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:42.030]
got to change the whole deal instead of goodbye he's going to say hello and hey you love me here

[01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:46.030]
and if you don't too bad because i'm not going anywhere and put away the steel salami sandwich because

[01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:52.670]
i'm not getting on the bus here's a mobile in Miramar hello hey good morning good evening before i

[01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:56.710]
get to what i really wanted to talk about when you're getting good stuff yes you know before i

[01:02:56.710 --> 01:03:01.770]
get to the important stuff you said something about dav one step and could you believe he's going

[01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:07.450]
to be assistant head coach oh okay well that makes sense right okay well that's what he was

[01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:12.270]
you know widely rumored that they wanted desperately and he's coming okay that's what i thought it

[01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:16.790]
might be that Jimmy was going to stay as general manager and dav one step i take over his head coach

[01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:20.630]
i guess that's not okay but i thought he had coached and they're extending his contract

[01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:25.450]
oh okay well good job for you guys to get on the story great job for Hank yeah for Hank

[01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:30.330]
especially but anyway what i want to talk about is how can the senate stay face at this point

[01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:36.450]
i mean i don't understand that they can't they can't impeach them or they'll lose in thousand for sure

[01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:41.550]
so what do you what do they do at this point i have no idea you know i mean there are a lot of

[01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:46.890]
obvious ideas i would be i'd love to spare especially with Larry flint wheel in this chair around

[01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:50.830]
and threatening you jay to the right wing republican i mean you got to know that they're like

[01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:54.410]
did they're caught between the rock and hard place because they're caught between the house the

[01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:59.510]
fanatical house republicans you know who who are like uh you know the bob bars and of course

[01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:02.910]
they already got him and Tom Delayson i think they're going to get him and all these guys they're

[01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:08.530]
caught between them and this bus solve like them being the next one to be outed exactly and and

[01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:11.990]
way i would get a gov like kind of like cut in the meat grinder that's a bad expression to use

[01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:15.270]
and let it what happened a couple of days ago here but they're kind of like cottony or grinder

[01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:19.690]
exactly but i i mean as far as the democrats go i don't see how they're going to lose in this

[01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:23.650]
situation yeah i'm republican but i'm a little bit embarrassed being one at the point it isn't

[01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:27.930]
embarrassing you know it's like i mean it's obvious i mean you can you can it's like it's like dog

[01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:31.710]
crap you can you can put ketchup on it you can dial it up you can call it a different name no

[01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:35.410]
matter what you do the way that still don't crap and they're taking stuff i mean i don't care

[01:04:35.410 --> 01:04:40.350]
how many pages of information they have 80 million pages of information the fact is that the public

[01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:47.010]
we we we we saw Clinton we so we saw the uh uh the uh grand jury testimony we saw that verbatim

[01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:51.190]
then they put the polo Jones testimony on here and each time they put this stuff on there there's a

[01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:55.270]
oh this is the stuff that's really going to turn the public opinion polls against them and this

[01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:59.590]
is what's really going to be and it never worked and they just keep trying and trying and falling

[01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:03.970]
on their ass it's accurate well that's the thing they keep they keep putting the same information out

[01:05:03.970 --> 01:05:08.650]
and and trying to i guess trying to portray it in a different life but the whole thing is they keep

[01:05:08.650 --> 01:05:12.190]
nobody different on the dog crap but you know something it's still a pile of crap right nobody

[01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:17.170]
gives a shot about it at all right but but in closing i have something for Jimmy yes sir he's

[01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:23.750]
put your hair spray in the basket all right yeah we better do something about Jimmy's duo okay he's

[01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:30.070]

[01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:04.410]
i'm wondering if i could get your your opinion on something yes don't you think that all of the

[01:07:04.850 --> 01:07:10.650]
firings and their uh quitting like jordan and jimmy johnson i just manufactured uh

[01:07:10.650 --> 01:07:16.210]
employees by the media to get uh interesting something that people just still care about anymore

[01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:20.670]
like the mba who would have cared about it if jordan wouldn't have quit and the dolphins i mean

[01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:24.230]
they're waiting for the way to them it the jordan quitting doesn't help the nva it'll let

[01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:27.950]
make it ten times hundred times worse doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't but but but

[01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:33.910]
people are talking about it yeah and i mean and the johnson thing i mean i was already no

[01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:37.750]
not that i'd really cared about the dolphins anymore but uh i'm actually kind of interested in

[01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:41.990]
laying the same way that uh you know you're interested in a car crash about the dolphin now because

[01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:45.830]
they're like they're like wounded uh this this is not some kind of publicity stuff i believe

[01:07:45.830 --> 01:07:49.410]
absolutely that he was going to resign or that he certainly attended until he talked to

[01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:54.610]
Wayne this morning and now uh whatever they discussed he's uh you know he's saying uh but but

[01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:58.270]
you're but you're right to media milks this stuff just like right now i mean you you got to

[01:07:58.270 --> 01:08:03.130]
understand when you've got a 24 hour sports network or 24 hour news network takes a lot of

[01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:07.850]
crap to fill up all that time you're gonna have an nonstop and believe me that they give it to him

[01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:12.250]
great well thanks for your opinion man that keep repeating that number over and over again

[01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:17.430]

[01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:21.870]

please don't say the s word but anyway sorry about what?

[01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:30.530]

[01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:33.970]
some companionship i mean we sure don't want to talk to him maybe there are people in the audience

[01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:40.570]

[01:08:40.570 --> 01:08:44.170]
nine two seventy five ninety seven it keeps calling here over and over again and spewing up

[01:08:44.170 --> 01:08:48.630]

[01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:53.010]

might not be able to talk to anybody see it's it's just always amazing having done this for about

[01:08:57.130 --> 01:09:01.650]
five hundred years just how uh these people really butch up behind the anonymity of the telephone

[01:09:01.650 --> 01:09:07.230]
they really butch up and even the most easily of pathetic individuals become real big macho guys

[01:09:07.230 --> 01:09:13.330]

[01:10:58.730 --> 01:11:04.210]
their one game over two hundred and twelve minutes plus since Philadelphia's a lot of gold with a

[01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:07.990]
Beas are in the that's most of the way but he was the reason the Panthers were by last year right

[01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:11.950]
oh yeah that's right so like I said once somebody is gone or you think they're gonna be gone

[01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:15.410]
then you stick it to him you just stick the shiv in there and you twist the

[01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:18.770]
turn he was a son of a bitch he was no but he was the reason for everybody else's problem

[01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:24.930]
because he's gone that doesn't take any talent but only in this case now you got a little bit of a

[01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:31.350]
problem because now guess what Jimmy ain't leaving that's what's on channel six but we can't get it

[01:11:31.730 --> 01:11:35.930]
so so we're meaning what why do I want to see Dan LaBaster what's he gonna do if you can

[01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:41.210]
well why do I want to see Dan LaBaster I don't want to see that jackass and what does he

[01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:48.030]
care about Jimmy so much Jimmy's not Cuban here's my Amy Lake hello there's a little different

[01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:54.530]
perspective yes sir I'm a Miami dolphin hater and a Jimmy hater so when I heard that he was leaving

[01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:59.330]
I was upset I wanted to have anybody but hey I understand I want him to stay here and suffer with

[01:11:59.330 --> 01:12:04.810]
those guys they're not going anywhere for another three years yeah so I'm glad possible and the

[01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:10.650]
one okay and thank you so much well our good least of you guys being honest season title he

[01:12:10.650 --> 01:12:15.090]
enjoys is one of those people that hates he loves hating Jimmy and that's the way it is just like

[01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:18.930]
they show there are a lot of people that are foaming at the mouth of the idea that I might ever

[01:12:18.930 --> 01:12:23.650]
leave here in spite of what they might tell you they're full of crap they would puke now did we

[01:12:23.650 --> 01:12:27.250]
get launched by the way or is that like I'm working on it they don't have a delivery person

[01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:34.450]
playing I'll tell you the details in the break I got to find a runner well when did you find that out

[01:12:36.170 --> 01:12:41.750]

[01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:46.490]
about to hopefully it'll kick in one of these days bad idea dr. Marco case in 164 over 108

[01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:54.950]
as in real real bad real bad idea two open lines in date 5 6 7 0 5 60 and 0 5 60 out of 18

[01:12:54.950 --> 01:13:01.150]
to your wireless line here's a mobile in Miami hello hey me oh I had a chuckle yes sir had to

[01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:06.510]

very much sir open line and brown at 5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the 18t wireless line

[01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:25.350]
here's the mobile in North Miami hello hey what's up how are you doing sir uh let's lift a big part

[01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:30.850]
let me tell you why I come he don't say nothing about no democrats uh cheap in all that because he's

[01:13:30.850 --> 01:13:35.510]
part because he's partisan he already told you that you've already you've already got the Bob bars

[01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:39.410]
in the uh Ken stars of the world doing that how much you think the White House is paying them

[01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:43.790]
I don't think the White House is paying them anything how much you think they're paying them uh I think

[01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:48.090]
there either paying them or doing some kind of favors for them now they're all they're also making

[01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:54.710]
up the stuff about Bob bar and Bob Livingston he just making it up yeah but what about all the

[01:13:54.710 --> 01:13:58.310]
finger points the democrats are the ones who are the finger point is in the hypocrites it's all

[01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:01.670]
these good Republicans you just are you just keep repeating the same thing over and over again like

[01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:06.210]
a stuck record because you're a silly partisan fool is what the problem is you're a silly person

[01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:11.310]
and no matter how many times I would repeat it he'd keep repeating it so is there any point

[01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:18.030]
on continuing no of course not I'm assay you know both parties generally speak in suck it's only the

[01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:22.130]
the democrats are the buffer party they prevent us from the right wing totally taking over

[01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:27.430]
that's uh what they are around for thank god for that but they're both blushing our tax money down

[01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:31.510]
the drain like it's coming like I was going through a toilet and have been doing it for years

[01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:36.650]
but in the meantime at least if you want to preserve any minimal amount of freedom you just have

[01:14:36.650 --> 01:14:41.330]
to hope that the right wing move takes don't take control which is exactly what they've been trying

[01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:49.350]
to do without even a blood bath here's Miami hello hello yes sir yes um you know this morning I was

[01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:54.750]
listening to a show and they had a lot of Jimmy bachelor's right and everybody they were ripping

[01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:04.710]

[01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:09.350]

[01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:15.030]

[01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:21.650]
gonna happen to him yeah he's a dumb moboso so I think for all those Jimmy bashes I'm happy that he

[01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:26.630]
stayed now they can they can die in their pack yeah now they can stick it where the moon don't shine

[01:15:27.210 --> 01:15:32.090]
okay thank god pal can beat that day to meet yeah that's the perfect place up there in

[01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:35.650]
Gainesville for Steve Spurrier that he fits in there like a rubber glove just to keep him there okay

[01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:40.570]
I mean we've already got enough you know it'll be tartos running around this time without Steve

[01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:47.690]
Spurrier coming down here like we got plenty of those already here's Miami hello Neil yes sir yeah I

[01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:52.030]
get uh I'm I'm like a new zone I watch a lot of football and I got this coming I want to know if

[01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:58.350]
you have the center pin that I do I used to look at Jimmy Thompson like a man who never quit you

[01:15:58.350 --> 01:16:04.770]
know you still have this hardcore style of I don't know like defense is a hard man he's a hard man

[01:16:04.770 --> 01:16:08.610]
yeah no not a hard man but you know what I mean so you just said you say it's a hard man which I'm

[01:16:08.610 --> 01:16:14.170]
no I'm saying like I'm talking and now I see him like you I don't know how's it gonna put it like

[01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:19.550]
now he quit and now he comes back like this nothing else but he did not quit that you're you're

[01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:23.870]
nothing out on us he had that mentality of quitting he can go on to a football player and tell him

[01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:29.910]
now you can't quit now now if you want to say no I don't now he can't he can't get to one

[01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:35.690]
player and tell him now I'm out now the time but the fact is he didn't quit you know there are

[01:16:35.690 --> 01:16:40.170]
a lot of people who have jobs including yours truly who have problems with their management or

[01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:44.730]
have falling out or what and we don't know we haven't heard from him yet whatever the reasons

[01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:49.150]
really might have been and evidently he met with the owner of Baldi over there and they got it

[01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:53.130]
straight enough and okay now he's staying but he didn't quit and you're just assuming that

[01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:56.610]
because everybody put in the newspaper and about your losers were on a ranting and raving this

[01:16:56.610 --> 01:17:02.090]

[01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:06.610]
loser and believe me I got no action run one way or the other with Jimmy because like I said

[01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:08.610]
so naturally we're gonna spend a lot of time and create a press conference but now if you want to do

[01:27:08.610 --> 01:27:12.870]

[01:27:17.890 --> 01:27:22.430]

then i have a lot of great things for charity and it's well-liked all over time by most people

[01:27:36.190 --> 01:27:40.470]
with a brain but don't confuse people okay don't waste your effort or your breath calling

[01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:45.410]
this show to knock Dan merino yes he's a statue yes he can't run and yes he's no John L.O.

[01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:55.390]
their line and probably bell stop was sabotaging us again i'm sure i'm serious this this show gets

[01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:59.510]
cut off more than all the other shows put together on this radio station we have this i s d n line

[01:29:59.510 --> 01:30:02.890]
which should be their part there shouldn't be no problem with it and almost every day we get

[01:30:02.890 --> 01:30:08.470]
dittled around with here sabotage sure i know my other point i wanted to make was as far as this

[01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:13.690]
thing going on with the president and the senate yes sir i think a lot of it is like you said

[01:30:13.690 --> 01:30:19.210]
is the definite conspiracy it's way too obvious that it isn't and secondly i do believe that most

[01:30:19.210 --> 01:30:25.530]
of the old men wish they had a 24 year old uh humidor alright amen thank you man you bet thank you

[01:30:25.530 --> 01:30:29.390]
those right wingers are jealous because the guys like bob bar there you know he's got some old bag

[01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:35.610]
that he's buying new gingriches he that oh god that new wife of his woo heavy duty and i mean

[01:30:35.610 --> 01:30:40.570]
makes a little trip another trip look like a woman that's how hot she is anyway better do this

[01:30:40.570 --> 01:30:46.990]
the meal Roger show now on five sixy wqa my amy fort lauderdale

[01:30:46.990 --> 01:30:50.490]
there's hang up potted up again would you please because hang is on the right now number now

[01:30:51.050 --> 01:30:56.890]
what is what is that the 207 three three now we're finding out with Georgia's watching some other

[01:30:56.890 --> 01:31:00.810]
relationship you're saying has improved or at least Jimmy Johnson is concerned about the

[01:31:00.810 --> 01:31:05.250]
relationship and what about the post build on the wrong possibility if Dan Reno getting that

[01:31:05.250 --> 01:31:09.150]
extension to remain the quarterback how's that going to sit with Jimmy i think things were a little

[01:31:09.150 --> 01:31:15.450]
icy between them at some time during the season but Jimmy was very abusive and the way he praised

[01:31:15.450 --> 01:31:20.370]
Dan's play three of the last four weeks of the season going into the Denver game he felt that

[01:31:20.370 --> 01:31:25.510]
that Dan had played the best that he had since Jimmy had been there and and talking with Dan

[01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:31.410]
he felt that way before the season ended he he said to me that he felt better than he had in a

[01:31:31.410 --> 01:31:36.230]
long time and i think a lot of that came from their efforts to run the football in a way they

[01:31:36.230 --> 01:31:41.550]
protected Dan and i and i think that they had been trying to they have been talking about

[01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:46.070]
extending Dan's contract which would accomplish two things help him catwise where they already have

[01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:50.810]
about four million going into the off season and keep Dan around for another couple of years

[01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:58.050]
all right how about the addition of Dave Wands dad now Dave Wands dad of course and Jimmy Johnson

[01:31:58.050 --> 01:32:02.710]
close friends a lot of folks that Dave Wands thought Dave Wands dad deserved maybe a little more

[01:32:02.710 --> 01:32:06.410]
time in Chicago he had a lot of time it looked like he was finally starting to turn things around

[01:32:06.410 --> 01:32:11.950]
injuries helped sidetracked at and immediately he has swooped up in Miami what is his role going to

[01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:18.250]
be specifically and is this Johnson flexing his own his own muscles with power i don't think so

[01:32:18.250 --> 01:32:22.810]
i think david's not the power part of it uh... david's want role will be assistant head coach George

[01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:27.750]
Hill is a defensive coordinator did a great job they had the number one defense and points a lot

[01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:33.790]
i think during the regular season and uh... and they have a terrific young defensive team and

[01:32:33.790 --> 01:32:39.510]
George is 64 years old but i know he's going to come back and coach again next year i think uh...

[01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:45.610]
Jimmy has always been comfortable with with a confidant somebody who's close to him david certainly

[01:32:45.610 --> 01:32:50.650]
has been when david's first was uh... new he was going to be fired in chicago

[01:32:50.650 --> 01:32:55.590]
Jimmy advised them that perhaps he's going to get two years of two million four hundred thousand dollars

[01:32:55.590 --> 01:33:00.170]
that's a million two a year that perhaps he might want to take a year off and spend time with his

[01:33:00.170 --> 01:33:05.090]
family and just sit back and sit through some offers i know one of the offers that he had was

[01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:10.950]
to be George Seaford's defensive coordinator in Carolina i think dav uh... might be inclined to

[01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:16.470]
to use this to regroup for himself and i think he'll be a head coach again a league maybe he'll

[01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:21.910]
even succeed jimmy and my amy jimmy has one year left on his contract there's a possibility that

[01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:26.830]
jimmy could step up his general manager but that's just speculation on my part i don't know that for sure

[01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:32.510]
now i think we've got some numbers here as far as uh... jimmy's fourth year in the past uh... he was

[01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:37.090]
very successful in balefin's fourth year winning the first of two super bowls and what about his

[01:33:37.090 --> 01:33:42.130]
fourth year in my amy of course uh... the expectations have been high he is not yet made those

[01:33:42.130 --> 01:33:47.030]
expectations take is this a make a break here for jimmy johnson well i think it's a make year for

[01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:53.310]
jimmy in his own mind and that remember last year too he disappeared for about a month after losing

[01:33:53.890 --> 01:33:58.550]
to uh... indianapolis forty one to nothing on the road and then they played those two games against

[01:33:58.550 --> 01:34:02.950]
the patriots and they finished the season poorly and remember they gave up seventy six points in

[01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:07.790]
the last two road games this year the last game against the land and and that game up in

[01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:12.610]
then for last week so i'm sure he's a little sour that way but just uh... despite that he likes his

[01:34:12.610 --> 01:34:17.790]
defense very much he went in a denver with several injuries jason taylor's best pass rusher and

[01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:23.530]
him bones is best run stopper they'll be back next year they have to make a decision on richman web

[01:34:23.530 --> 01:34:29.510]
who was uh... uh... his contract is up he's a free agent this year they're all pro pro left tackle but

[01:34:29.650 --> 01:34:34.850]
let me follow me a couple weeks ago that this offseason will be totally devoted to building the

[01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:40.370]
offense he feels that that defense is young it's quick it's going to improve he has outstanding

[01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:46.910]
young corner backs he liked his two defensive line picks and Lorenzo bromel and Kenny makes and so

[01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:52.190]
it'll all be offense is your big play receiver big running back another mean line

[01:34:52.770 --> 01:34:57.210]
hey gober we thank you so much for lost Vegas to work the tyson fight can you bring it back

[01:34:57.210 --> 01:35:02.950]
to t-shirt i think he should wrote the one either one which ever one cheaper all right

[01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:07.350]
ok that's good to let go of the work of the press conference that was hank on the sp and news

[01:35:07.850 --> 01:35:12.930]
great job hummer i uh... hammer i'll tell you one thing hank put himself on the map big time he

[01:35:12.930 --> 01:35:16.550]
already was but i mean so far he's in shoulders about all these other tours that sit around

[01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:20.630]
that that that that they don't just talk to the rest without talking to people involved who

[01:35:20.630 --> 01:35:23.870]
really don't know what they're talking about hank knows them all baby when he could that's why

[01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:27.330]
when he came on her and said that with the reading down my mind no no chance

[01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:32.610]
so come up in twenty seven minutes or thereabouts give or take uh... who knows got only watch him

[01:35:32.610 --> 01:35:37.910]
he johnson press conference and which he will now tv stand two open lines and date five six seven

[01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:42.410]
oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line and like i predicted the tone and the

[01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:47.950]
the sound of the audience has changed dramatically from what it was just a short time ago in most

[01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:53.610]
of the morning what about from what i heard the assassins have withdrawn their spirits and most of

[01:35:53.610 --> 01:35:58.730]
them have retreated to the back of the building here's a mobile in hollywood hello

[01:35:58.730 --> 01:36:03.530]
yeah no yes sir a couple things first i want to i told you i don't want to thank you both for that

[01:36:03.530 --> 01:36:08.070]
great cds and dates this year yes i took a lot of work on your part yes it is a second

[01:36:08.890 --> 01:36:12.670]
regarding it jimmy johnson i uh... lift close to him down the keys and

[01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:17.010]
couple streets over and i've seen some of the things like you said said that he's done

[01:36:17.010 --> 01:36:22.830]
to help underprivileged philanthropy and so on so forth jimmy johnson not like other people if you

[01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:27.190]
go up and ask jimmy even if he comes in the marina on his boat and you say coach can i have your

[01:36:27.190 --> 01:36:33.630]
autograph no problem i've never seen him say no to anybody and i've seen some of the real big

[01:36:33.630 --> 01:36:38.270]
easterl just that they're just push aside you know and uh... if he was going to leave i'd say the

[01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:43.690]
major reason was knowing him because i i see him around i've talked to him occasionally uh... it

[01:36:43.690 --> 01:36:47.910]
was family reasons you know this dad wants to be near a little bit more time and i think that's

[01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:52.690]
probably what they've worked out it wasn't money it wasn't anything else it was basically he needs more

[01:36:52.690 --> 01:36:55.870]
time to give his dad because he miss his not being with his mom as much yeah

[01:36:55.870 --> 01:37:00.430]
yeah and that has cancer in his underhand chemo therapy and that's it and you have to spend more time

[01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:04.570]
with family and he is i mean i'm sure that that's got to be a part of it maybe the biggest part of it

[01:37:04.570 --> 01:37:08.870]
who knows i mean certainly uh... you know he's entitled to have a chance to speak his mind in about

[01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:12.610]
a half an hour but to listen to the these people this morning coming out of the woodwork like a

[01:37:12.610 --> 01:37:16.530]
bunch of thermites it was unbelievable i'm driving in here and i couldn't believe it i mean all of a

[01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:20.550]
sudden they turn out to sky like a like a cornered rat yeah and there's no reason to because he did

[01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:26.170]
not come to my any for money you know i mean it wasn't a money situation right now that he

[01:37:26.170 --> 01:37:29.990]
came because i often met him i don't know he's not going to sit in the studio a fox with his uh... you

[01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:34.270]
know that cropped here i can all the money one and make it a lot more right anyway that's it

[01:37:34.270 --> 01:37:40.090]
that's a lot okay there you go all your stressons out there all you uh... many acts

[01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:46.470]
and that that i'm so glad that that happened the way they that these people all got caught with

[01:37:46.590 --> 01:37:52.210]
their pants down it's just beautiful because it shows you the true nature of the people in this town

[01:37:52.210 --> 01:37:58.310]
of the so-called sports band of the people in general talk about two faced and backstabbing and

[01:37:58.310 --> 01:38:02.830]
i mean turning like on a dime they can all of a sudden do this so incredible turn around

[01:38:03.550 --> 01:38:07.750]
wow he's shocked anyway with like like for example if they announced tomorrow which of course

[01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:11.930]
it could never happen but if they announced tomorrow that the panthers were and by the way thank

[01:38:11.930 --> 01:38:15.930]
god for shan burk for you panther fans last night if he wouldn't have played great the least what

[01:38:15.930 --> 01:38:20.370]
of what about seven of them last night he's the only thing that's kept those panthers in game after

[01:38:20.370 --> 01:38:24.110]
game for last two or three weeks and you guys better kiss him on the ass but it was going to be an

[01:38:24.110 --> 01:38:29.050]
out let's say he was playing lousy and it was an out that he's been traded the flies for john van

[01:38:29.050 --> 01:38:33.170]
beesbrook then all these people would have said oh we don't like the way he left here he's an asshole

[01:38:33.170 --> 01:38:37.890]
that was at all man he's been playing great thank god we're getting the bees are back bees bees

[01:38:37.890 --> 01:38:43.690]
it's it's just there's no credibility there no credibility whatsoever and then of course when

[01:38:43.690 --> 01:38:46.650]
you come back to what i always say which is that most of them don't know what they're talking about

[01:38:46.650 --> 01:38:50.930]
anyway that that explains a lot of it look at that phone now all of a sudden baby they're

[01:38:50.930 --> 01:38:57.130]
departing like flies on a file open line and broiled all three and date five six seven oh five

[01:38:57.130 --> 01:39:02.250]
sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line that's a line four-letter deal hello

[01:39:02.850 --> 01:39:08.330]
hey real yes sir the afternoon sir when is to you i was at the game last night it's very

[01:39:08.330 --> 01:39:13.950]
disappointed about one i was very disappointed about the score i thought the maple least played a

[01:39:13.950 --> 01:39:18.650]
terrific game i played two great periods and they ran out of steam yes they did they they they

[01:39:18.650 --> 01:39:22.710]
didn't play very good in their own zone in the third day i thought that we were very lucky to wind

[01:39:22.710 --> 01:39:27.550]
up with a tie i mean the late late in the third and early and at over time uh it was a miracle

[01:39:27.550 --> 01:39:32.190]
that the least pull out the tie did you get to enjoy the game the i enjoyed it tremendously and the

[01:39:32.190 --> 01:39:36.870]
people with a little baby stayed home thank god bless them thank them very much and i enjoyed it

[01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:40.250]
very much saw the whole game didn't have people running around in front of me holding up their little

[01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:45.850]
kids it was great that's good we still can't see the goal light down there on the shoe twice and you

[01:39:45.850 --> 01:39:51.530]
know down there are the uh to my right the people all the people that sit on the east side stands in

[01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:55.430]
the a macawena still can't see the goal light and let me say it again i'll keep saying it all year

[01:39:55.890 --> 01:40:00.710]
until they fix that it tells me this is such a bush league organization they don't care

[01:40:00.710 --> 01:40:03.810]
about the fans they don't give a crap about the people that spend all that money to put in

[01:40:03.810 --> 01:40:09.930]
the Wayne's pocket i was sitting right behind the goal actually last night and if i'm correct i

[01:40:09.930 --> 01:40:13.810]
don't even think that goal light that i was sitting behind and works doesn't how do you like that

[01:40:13.810 --> 01:40:18.990]
so that that's a real big league operation yeah yeah well you know the macawena is uh

[01:40:19.670 --> 01:40:24.410]
how much money did they spend on that money 200 million oh public money you can't even get a

[01:40:24.410 --> 01:40:29.690]
goal light to work yeah i you know i volunteered way back in the early in the season i offered i

[01:40:29.690 --> 01:40:33.090]
said who i get some real goal lights in there like they haven't made believe gardens or any real arena

[01:40:33.090 --> 01:40:35.590]
i'll put the bill how much good a cost you know if you hundred bucks

[01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:41.710]
so yeah it's just unbelievable unbelievable but hopefully the made beliefs will rebound they've

[01:40:41.710 --> 01:40:45.750]
been playing well what he's so sad for crying out loud they they pulled the game out of their ass

[01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:50.670]
and tampered the night before they got 51 points they're kicking serious ass so they they look

[01:40:50.670 --> 01:40:54.670]
great last night for two periods that too many games in two short of a period of time and then

[01:40:54.670 --> 01:40:59.050]

with their pants down opened up a big mouth i'm coming in this morning and all these experts

[01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:09.590]
both on the air and the callers that that that that that that they're talking up a storm like they

[01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:14.290]
know something hang calls in here 20 to 11 and just unmasked all of them and makes them all look

[01:45:14.290 --> 01:45:19.050]
like uh pile of crap you you think they'd have learned you know time and time again hang's done

[01:45:19.050 --> 01:45:24.570]
this to all the all the people in the newspaper all the media cause hang knows all the printables

[01:45:24.570 --> 01:45:28.850]
involved and he gets his information directly from those people and this doesn't just shouldn't

[01:45:28.850 --> 01:45:33.290]
read some stupid thing that uh some irresponsible jackass wrote in the newspaper i mean they'd be

[01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:37.190]
better off just to wait for hang to give this report and then write it the next day

[01:45:37.190 --> 01:45:40.350]
yeah i mean it would at least it would be you know that that doesn't kill enough good airtime

[01:45:40.350 --> 01:45:45.210]
at least it'd be accurate right now you're now you're not taking keep your feet on the ground keep

[01:45:45.210 --> 01:45:50.050]
your head in the clouds all right uh we have an open-ended brow it's five so how you always

[01:45:50.050 --> 01:45:54.690]
decision and uh i'm a Jimmy Johnson i didn't i didn't know Jimmy Johnson was black did you

[01:45:54.690 --> 01:45:58.850]
did you know that no what did that kind of do with Mike Tyson what what did she be talking about

[01:45:58.850 --> 01:46:04.690]
does anybody out there know no i'll bend out a shape i think was that Mike Tyson think

[01:46:04.690 --> 01:46:10.010]
the cutter saw cutter he's a scumbag okay a scumbag a convicted rapist and a piece of crap

[01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:14.010]
and a lot of idiots are gonna go out there a lot of morons and pay 50 bucks to watch him beat up

[01:46:14.010 --> 01:46:20.850]
some bum this Saturday out there at the mgm grand and it's pathetic and all i can tell you man

[01:46:20.850 --> 01:46:26.450]
all i can tell you that no for a fact is that's the american fucking way here's a mobile in Miami hello

[01:46:27.230 --> 01:46:33.950]
hello yes sir oh mr. Rogers yes i am i have a problem like you have with the blood pressure

[01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:41.830]
and i had seven botches on my heart in 96 496 and was put on blood pressure medicine i've been able

[01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:47.730]
to take myself off of that due to adkins and garlic yeah taking fresh garlic in the morning

[01:46:47.730 --> 01:46:53.370]
like maybe a clove of it and chop it up a big yeah and it lowers that blood pressure that

[01:46:53.370 --> 01:47:00.670]
distillate in 10 to 70s when i go off that can trouble shoot right up i just want to let you know

[01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:07.010]
and i enjoy your show very much thanks a lot my best advice though is don't stop taking any

[01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:12.830]
prescription medication without using your brain okay even if your doctor tells you to do it

[01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:18.010]
just get a second opinion like George says one of the worst moves i've ever made thank god i got

[01:47:18.010 --> 01:47:21.430]
enough of a brain to bring my little blood pressure thing in here this morning and that adalab

[01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:25.550]
pills just in case as i said to myself what if i go in there because when you're working obviously

[01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:29.430]
your pressure is going to go up and i've been taking this particular medication along with one

[01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:34.290]
other one for like two years and doing very well on it and what if i go in there and don't take it

[01:47:34.290 --> 01:47:37.890]
and then suddenly my pressure goes skyrocketing which it was and i don't have anything of course i

[01:47:37.890 --> 01:47:46.050]
wouldn't have known anyway yeah another stroke of genius nice going you i think George may have

[01:47:46.050 --> 01:47:50.170]
the best idea about this whole thing you know i'm saying okay the second opinion here's a

[01:47:50.170 --> 01:47:55.770]
providence Rhode Island hello how you doing okay sir it's tough being a dolphin finna pick is

[01:47:55.770 --> 01:48:01.010]
you got to rely on some second hand information well down here they rely on 10 ten in for my

[01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:07.610]
child hanko that's true i'm glad to hear him or in his report just just curious i mean i mean

[01:48:07.610 --> 01:48:13.230]
just to add another note that i mean i personally think of Jimmy left we'd be maybe not in

[01:48:13.230 --> 01:48:18.470]
the shambles would be very tough to recover from that uh look i think we're moving forward and uh

[01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:23.010]
i i you know i i'd that would be the worst thing for the team at this point but my question being i

[01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:27.210]
keep hearing i search the internet i keep hearing we need a big receiver which i know we do a big

[01:48:27.210 --> 01:48:32.190]
running back and we need help along the offensive line but the the thing is how are we going to do

[01:48:32.190 --> 01:48:36.530]
this is he going to go out and get a big name free agent receiver i mean i don't see too many things

[01:48:36.530 --> 01:48:40.550]
i think i think shulas said the best we need somehow okay call one of the sports shows call a

[01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:44.490]
pank and talk about that okay i don't talk sports we have an open line of day one in brush see you

[01:48:44.490 --> 01:48:48.030]
see the problem with this there too there are two different aspects it's a major new story in town

[01:48:48.030 --> 01:48:51.470]
which is why i'm talking about it and why we certainly are carrying the press conference but on

[01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:55.530]
the other hand the the people i want to discuss all the interest the sports ever sees do it

[01:48:55.530 --> 01:49:02.970]
someplace else i don't do it and have no interest here's Miami hello how you doing new i'm sorry

[01:49:02.970 --> 01:49:09.910]
i believe in it to use as you started in qm so i got to listen to your um woman catholic you know

[01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:14.130]
the talk and the other day i was in my house my woman catholic talk yeah you know the the

[01:49:14.130 --> 01:49:19.010]

[01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:35.970]
franko gay yeah as the whole story you know and then this kid at the end he gets at the you know

[01:49:35.970 --> 01:49:41.590]

[01:49:41.590 --> 01:49:48.050]
this says that he's still serving yep he said that he's still serving time so i you know i

[01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:51.050]
just call you to see maybe you want to check that movie out judgment yeah it's called judgment

[01:49:51.050 --> 01:49:57.290]
usually like uh on videos on tv is that i don't know i saw it in hbo okay all right i'll check it out

[01:49:57.290 --> 01:50:01.630]
okay thanks a lot and don't forget pal this is my fact in the church we had an of course you know

[01:50:01.630 --> 01:50:04.850]
you see a bunch of guys running around and dressed with a silly little beanie on i mean that's

[01:50:04.850 --> 01:50:08.750]
uh probably you know that's the way it ought to be right yeah open line of days five so and of course

[01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:13.110]

here's western hello

[01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:40.790]
hey me oh what up

[01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:45.190]
about jimmy johnson they were sent one guy in western art isn't a guy in

[01:53:45.190 --> 01:53:47.970]
uh... key west was saying that uh... or western whatever sender

[01:53:47.970 --> 01:53:52.030]
he was saying that it sounds like uh... the reason that jimmy johnson would

[01:53:52.030 --> 01:53:55.850]
have left if he had left at all what uh... was because of the family but uh...

[01:53:55.850 --> 01:53:57.930]
i'm not so sure that that's accurate i'm thinking

[01:53:57.930 --> 01:53:58.150]
uh...

[01:53:59.330 --> 01:54:03.090]
all the time that he has in the offseason to be with his family that doesn't

[01:54:03.090 --> 01:54:06.430]
really go well with me what do you think i think it may be part of it you know

[01:54:06.430 --> 01:54:08.010]
but i there's a lot more to it than that

[01:54:08.010 --> 01:54:11.170]
there gotta be a lot more to that you know i think i think we'll wait and see

[01:54:11.170 --> 01:54:14.970]
what he has to say and she fits credible and i don't think i think we all need

[01:54:14.970 --> 01:54:17.910]
to be a little patient around here don't i like those people with a big mouth

[01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:20.470]
in the morning all these colors calling in who ready to put them up on a

[01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:23.870]
cross and let's you know burn it said on fire amen you'll take care of a great

[01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:24.110]
day

[01:54:24.750 --> 01:54:27.030]
okay twelve thirty let's let's see what this uh...

[01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:31.470]
was so i was in that in around davie florida to save the lease jimmy johnson

[01:54:31.470 --> 01:54:35.110]
frustrating and his season is he got his banged up dolphins to the post even

[01:54:35.110 --> 01:54:39.310]
humiliated thirty eight to three to hand for the broncos reports everywhere said

[01:54:39.310 --> 01:54:44.370]
that johnson would resign today in eleven a and three press conference well

[01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:48.090]
johnson had an early meeting this morning thanks to you know we're not going

[01:54:48.090 --> 01:54:52.470]
and then marino and apparently that is not the case that you see he's in earlier

[01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:55.630]
this morning i think that uh... pronto i mean winter baseball

[01:54:55.630 --> 01:54:57.750]
in the middle of my way to get over there

[01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:57.850]
and

[01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:01.870]
and uh...

[01:55:04.030 --> 01:55:08.650]
jimmy johnson has a change of heart and he will not resign as head coach of

[01:55:08.650 --> 01:55:12.490]
the rami dolby's recording will stick around our own and go broke it

[01:55:12.490 --> 01:55:13.470]
there you're joining

[01:55:13.470 --> 01:55:15.930]
uh... you know that was that a talk up or what

[01:55:15.930 --> 01:55:19.570]
and trying to evaluate what was going on jimmy said i know there are a lot of

[01:55:19.570 --> 01:55:20.770]
things during the season

[01:55:20.770 --> 01:55:22.190]
that were bothering him

[01:55:22.190 --> 01:55:25.470]
he's been troubled by the fact that coaching change so much

[01:55:25.470 --> 01:55:27.930]
just in a couple years that he was out in that

[01:55:27.930 --> 01:55:32.310]
uh... it's difficult to deal with players uh... particularly the higher paid

[01:55:32.310 --> 01:55:32.810]
ones

[01:55:32.810 --> 01:55:35.150]
in terms of their responsiveness and

[01:55:35.150 --> 01:55:37.950]
uh... the second thing that bother was uh...

[01:55:37.950 --> 01:55:40.810]
at black monday when five coaches were fired and

[01:55:40.810 --> 01:55:43.410]
he felt that was unjust and it cast some

[01:55:43.410 --> 01:55:47.610]
negative feelings on the profession and his mind and the third thing was that he

[01:55:47.610 --> 01:55:50.490]
was not at all happy with the media in the way that

[01:55:50.490 --> 01:55:52.770]
they treated a lot of stories this year

[01:55:52.770 --> 01:55:56.870]
particularly the week that dammarino through for four hundred touchdown pass and

[01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:57.150]
jimmy

[01:55:57.150 --> 01:55:58.270]
didn't give him

[01:55:58.270 --> 01:56:02.810]
uh... a lot of platoon is postgame press conference which the local press made a

[01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:03.370]
lot of

[01:56:03.370 --> 01:56:07.590]
and the talk shows as well and i know i went into jimmy's radio show that week

[01:56:07.590 --> 01:56:11.350]
and he was very concerned about that he said the means that what i supposed to

[01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:12.670]
do about this you know i'm

[01:56:12.670 --> 01:56:15.430]
if i say something they get me if i don't

[01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:17.750]
they get me so i think that was bothering him too

[01:56:18.690 --> 01:56:22.350]
well the number four has been very significant in jimmy johnson's coaching career

[01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:25.570]
back at my amie threatened to walk he stuck around in his fourth year in one

[01:56:25.570 --> 01:56:29.290]
of national championship in his fourth year the Dallas cowboys he won the first

[01:56:29.290 --> 01:56:30.910]
of two super bowl championships

[01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:35.490]
now the path ahead is to try to get it done with the money dolphins in this

[01:56:35.490 --> 01:56:36.950]
his fourth year

[01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:39.690]
that will be coming up here

[01:56:40.290 --> 01:56:43.610]

[01:57:46.590 --> 01:57:47.470]
side yeah

[01:57:48.850 --> 01:57:50.130]

[01:58:12.710 --> 01:58:15.150]

[01:58:48.210 --> 01:58:51.970]
where we go in here's a um mobile in kindle

[01:58:51.970 --> 01:58:52.330]
hello

[01:58:52.330 --> 01:58:54.750]
yeah how's it going great

[01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:57.930]
listen uh two things one i am gonna see the mic

[01:58:57.930 --> 01:59:01.050]
tights and fight but it's because i'm not paying for it i got that illegal box

[01:59:01.050 --> 01:59:05.310]
okay and it's or nearly i ordinarily on the air you know i always have to say

[01:59:05.310 --> 01:59:08.270]
that the how are the illegal box and it's a very evil thing but in this case

[01:59:09.170 --> 01:59:13.130]
it's justifiable yeah and the second thing is i was driving out of palmella i saw a car

[01:59:13.130 --> 01:59:17.470]
with a big dent on the side and it says with a bumper sticker Jesus watches over

[01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:19.890]
me i saw he must have blinked

[01:59:19.890 --> 01:59:23.790]
boy yeah how to go near well he doesn't always do a good job you know he's busy doing a lot

[01:59:23.790 --> 01:59:27.230]
of other stuff we have two open i like you know

[01:59:27.230 --> 01:59:30.930]
with these football games like i've always told you what is that welcome

[01:59:31.630 --> 01:59:35.090]
a great addition to our coaching staff

[01:59:35.730 --> 01:59:38.870]
someone that i had known for a long long time

[01:59:40.030 --> 01:59:43.630]
somebody that's going to help us take that next step

[01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:48.890]
and that's they want step they've uh they've and i coached together

[01:59:49.770 --> 01:59:52.710]
at various places at university at Pittsburgh

[01:59:53.690 --> 01:59:57.390]
at Oklahoma State University of Miami Dallas Cowboys

[01:59:58.330 --> 02:00:03.150]
and uh he comes in as my assistant head coach

[02:00:03.850 --> 02:00:08.150]
and when i say assistant head coach i don't mean like they have on a lot of

[02:00:08.150 --> 02:00:14.390]
staff a token assistant head coach he is truly the assistant head coach

[02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:19.190]
in that and whenever maybe i'm not in

[02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:23.830]
mobile like at the senior bow next week i'll be there for a few days if i'm not there the whole

[02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:28.610]
week he will take the role as the head coach when i'm not there same thing

[02:00:28.610 --> 02:00:32.530]
whether that be our meetings here or at any in an applet on and on

[02:00:33.370 --> 02:00:36.850]
you know going back three years ago

[02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:41.750]
i made a statement that i was going to do everything

[02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:46.990]
in my power to bring a championship to the Miami dolphins in three years

[02:00:48.090 --> 02:00:52.890]
i can honestly say that i gave everything that i had

[02:00:53.610 --> 02:00:58.270]
a total commitment to make this team the very best that it could be

[02:00:59.490 --> 02:01:02.650]
although i'm disappointed that we didn't win a championship

[02:01:03.570 --> 02:01:08.170]
i am encouraged that we are very very close

[02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:13.710]
i really believe that that would allow us to win a couple more games

[02:01:14.670 --> 02:01:19.830]
during the regular season which would allow us to have a buy in the playoffs

[02:01:20.570 --> 02:01:24.250]
which would allow us uh to be able to be at home

[02:01:24.250 --> 02:01:28.410]
for the playoffs and have success so i think we're really close

[02:01:28.410 --> 02:01:36.690]
a month ago uh i've started a very trying period

[02:01:38.170 --> 02:01:43.530]
on my mother passed away and um we went through

[02:01:44.490 --> 02:01:48.770]
some time to where in all honesty it opened up my eyes

[02:01:49.710 --> 02:01:54.050]
as far as me realizing that i needed to spend some time

[02:01:54.050 --> 02:01:59.210]
with people that i care about as you all know coaching is not a

[02:02:00.250 --> 02:02:03.990]
nine to five job we go through seven or eight months

[02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:10.730]
of fifteen hour days and i went through that for about uh

[02:02:10.730 --> 02:02:18.950]
34 years in my early days it uh cost me spending time with my two sons

[02:02:19.870 --> 02:02:25.810]
it cost me a marriage and i could see some of these same things happening

[02:02:25.810 --> 02:02:30.550]
and i could say when mother died i realized that i really needed to spend some

[02:02:30.550 --> 02:02:32.430]
time with people that i cared about

[02:02:36.030 --> 02:02:38.690]
ronda rookmaker and myself we plan on getting married

[02:02:39.390 --> 02:02:41.210]
i wanted to spend time with her

[02:02:43.190 --> 02:02:48.770]
and so looking at all this i didn't see a way that i could

[02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:52.310]
juggle everything spending time with people i cared about

[02:02:52.890 --> 02:02:58.790]
and yet fulfilling my responsibility to make the mind the dolphins the best

[02:02:58.790 --> 02:03:03.350]
they could be i visited with Wayne hyzing this morning in

[02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:07.010]
limiteria what uh for people that don't know

[02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:14.730]
he is a special individual uh we have got great people here with my

[02:03:14.730 --> 02:03:17.070]
immediate organization great people with the dolphins

[02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:21.910]
and it all starts right there with Wayne we visited that length

[02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:27.070]
and i talked about Dave and he said you know jimmy he said why is it

[02:03:28.030 --> 02:03:33.550]
you can't just bring Dave in and it will allow you some time

[02:03:34.290 --> 02:03:39.690]
for ronda and your family and yet you've got the quality of

[02:03:40.350 --> 02:03:44.990]
someone that you respect as much as not more than anybody in the national

[02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:49.970]
football league to fill your shoes on those days that you're not there

[02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:55.410]
and uh the more we talk the more it made sense

[02:03:55.410 --> 02:03:59.450]
um i i really think it's going to be a great edition

[02:03:59.970 --> 02:04:02.910]
for the mined dolphins and let me assure everybody of this

[02:04:04.050 --> 02:04:10.750]
my determination and my commitment is not one bit less than what it has been

[02:04:10.750 --> 02:04:15.270]
before if anything else i think there's more resolved there

[02:04:15.850 --> 02:04:20.670]
to get the championship to the mined dolphins i think we have strengthened our

[02:04:20.670 --> 02:04:23.570]
staff i think we have strengthened this

[02:04:23.570 --> 02:04:29.090]
organization and again i think there's even more resolved to make this team

[02:04:29.890 --> 02:04:34.270]
one notch better uh not only did the Wayne

[02:04:35.090 --> 02:04:38.910]
spend time with me but it uh it was important that all the people in the

[02:04:38.910 --> 02:04:42.910]
organization the assistant coaches everybody from

[02:04:42.910 --> 02:04:49.130]
stew to and everybody and then even dan marino came up and dan

[02:04:49.130 --> 02:04:53.490]
sat down with me at length this morning and he said coach he said

[02:04:54.250 --> 02:04:59.130]
we are so close we're really close to getting to where we want to be

[02:05:00.930 --> 02:05:05.290]
and i think you know just the feeling of everybody uh

[02:05:05.850 --> 02:05:11.330]
made me realize that i could you know do what and accomplish what i wanted

[02:05:11.330 --> 02:05:16.830]
to accomplish in both areas and um i did talk to ronda a few minutes ago

[02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:22.650]
and um and uh she's excited about me staying the only thing she said

[02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:27.590]
was um just because you're staying i'm not letting you off the hook you're still

[02:05:27.590 --> 02:05:34.130]
marrying me and so and so i'm excited about it i think it's great for the

[02:05:34.130 --> 02:05:38.210]
mined dolphins and i can answer your questions later on

[02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:41.710]
but now i'll bring up day one step assistant hate coach

[02:05:44.990 --> 02:05:47.910]
it's great to be back in the dolphin organization uh

[02:05:47.910 --> 02:05:53.150]
hopefully this time will be a long to stay than uh the first for some of you

[02:05:53.150 --> 02:05:55.130]
who might not be familiar with i'm talking about i was

[02:05:55.130 --> 02:05:57.950]
coach who will hire me when i was at university my ammy

[02:05:57.950 --> 02:06:03.630]
uh got hired on here as the uh linebacker coach for seven weeks before

[02:06:03.630 --> 02:06:07.610]
ending up in Dallas with Jimmy but uh seriously it's

[02:06:07.610 --> 02:06:12.470]
this is a very exciting time for me to be involved with a great organization

[02:06:13.050 --> 02:06:17.810]
uh with a great owner and Wayne a man who's permitted to do what it takes to

[02:06:17.810 --> 02:06:22.750]
to be the best uh it's exciting to be to be back with Jimmy

[02:06:23.290 --> 02:06:29.730]
someone who i respect uh you know as on a professional level on a personal

[02:06:29.730 --> 02:06:34.090]
level and and we've had an awful lot of success together over the years as

[02:06:34.230 --> 02:06:38.210]
mentioned and and that's the plan here to uh to get that done

[02:06:39.110 --> 02:06:43.250]
as far as uh getting back into south florida you know living here when i

[02:06:43.250 --> 02:06:46.310]
coached university of my ammy my wife and kids are excited about

[02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:48.530]
about the opportunity and the challenge ahead

[02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:57.210]
lastly you know my my responsibility and what i'd bring to the table my

[02:06:57.210 --> 02:07:01.990]
commitment will be to do whatever i can do in any area to to make the dolphins

[02:07:01.990 --> 02:07:04.470]
better and to get where where we all want to get

[02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:22.050]
our defense coordinators George Hill nothing has changed there

[02:07:23.690 --> 02:07:25.710]
hippie browns are offensive coordinator

[02:07:25.710 --> 02:07:31.730]
uh and as i said before davis truly the assistant head coach

[02:07:32.330 --> 02:07:37.810]
and uh he will be involved in meetings just like i'm involved in meetings

[02:07:37.810 --> 02:07:41.830]
there may be times and davel be involved with sitting in with the offensive

[02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:44.210]
meetings while i'm sitting in with the defensive meetings

[02:07:44.910 --> 02:07:48.890]
our vice versa back and forth but this does not upstage

[02:07:49.970 --> 02:07:54.370]
anybody on our staff George Hill has done a tremendous job is a great

[02:07:54.370 --> 02:07:59.670]
football coach and i assured him uh that you know

[02:07:59.670 --> 02:08:04.450]
days coming in is really working with me more than he is with the defense

[02:08:05.170 --> 02:08:08.890]
and George welcomes it he said hey davin and i know each other well he said

[02:08:08.890 --> 02:08:13.150]
davis a great football coach and he said you know i look forward to

[02:08:13.730 --> 02:08:17.870]
dav having input to what we're doing so i think this is a real positive and

[02:08:17.870 --> 02:08:23.830]
and again uh as far as our staff uh George Hill and hippie brown

[02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:34.410]
both remain coordinators well the biggest thing again is

[02:08:36.950 --> 02:08:40.790]
the the feeling that i had was it was hard for me to juggle both

[02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:46.670]
roles and uh and have time for my family which uh is very important to me

[02:08:46.670 --> 02:08:51.850]
and something that i'm going to do uh and yet have a total commitment to the

[02:08:51.850 --> 02:08:56.210]
mind of dolphins uh there will be times that i won't be here

[02:08:56.210 --> 02:09:01.630]
16 hours a day uh and in those times dav is going to be working as a head coach

[02:09:01.630 --> 02:09:05.510]
there's sometimes i love personnel and i love you know

[02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:10.650]
being able to put together the product and so there's no way in the world that

[02:09:10.650 --> 02:09:13.850]
i'm going to miss any of that uh i think that uh

[02:09:13.850 --> 02:09:17.210]
we can pull out my expertise in certain areas

[02:09:17.850 --> 02:09:20.970]
and then we can add to it with davis expertise in certain areas

[02:09:20.970 --> 02:09:27.590]
but as far as uh the feeling that i had as far as maybe not coming back

[02:09:27.590 --> 02:09:32.670]
uh ronda not spent a couple days in the keys uh here the first part of this week

[02:09:32.670 --> 02:09:38.050]
and that's when that was and then when i was able to work out the total

[02:09:38.050 --> 02:09:40.430]
total program was this morning

[02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:48.050]
no i i i never did actually do anything along that line but that

[02:09:48.050 --> 02:09:51.350]
but all the uh the first time i had an opportunity to meet with

[02:09:51.350 --> 02:09:52.650]
Wayne was this morning

[02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:57.050]
do you mean it was because they do not avail it with the children's

[02:09:57.050 --> 02:09:58.810]
this idea would you accept that?

[02:09:59.630 --> 02:10:03.110]
i don't think uh i don't think any of us including myself

[02:10:03.110 --> 02:10:07.150]
can speculate for us what might have happened uh it didn't happen

[02:10:07.770 --> 02:10:12.970]
and again and i want to make sure this is very clear to everybody

[02:10:13.850 --> 02:10:19.970]
you know my commitment and my resolve and you know my efforts

[02:10:21.050 --> 02:10:28.030]
is not they are not diminished not one bit and if anything uh with another

[02:10:28.030 --> 02:10:32.170]
person here that i care about uh i feel even more

[02:10:32.170 --> 02:10:34.530]
responsibility to get in the job done

[02:10:35.450 --> 02:10:37.630]
do you think was there a contact extension?

[02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:42.730]
uh no no this this has nothing to do with contracture

[02:10:42.970 --> 02:10:46.810]
anything like that and so and that was that was never even discussed and

[02:10:46.810 --> 02:10:48.730]
and we had wanted to discuss it.

[02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:51.330]
did you know it's how long have you and you been talking about this

[02:10:51.330 --> 02:10:53.710]
you can think something together and i want to finish the work?

[02:10:53.990 --> 02:11:00.110]
oh davin i talked uh i think we probably had conversations

[02:11:01.710 --> 02:11:04.590]
at least once a week for the last uh

[02:11:05.210 --> 02:11:09.610]
10 or 15 years and i'm not exaggerating

[02:11:09.610 --> 02:11:14.430]
uh he's one of the few people that i i do talk to i i'm not much of a

[02:11:14.430 --> 02:11:17.470]
telephone person as anybody in this room that's ever tried to call

[02:11:17.470 --> 02:11:22.510]
my house might know um i've like i said i don't like talking on the

[02:11:22.510 --> 02:11:26.510]
telephone but there are a few people uh my family

[02:11:26.510 --> 02:11:32.890]
my sons days and occasionally north ferner and that's about the only phone

[02:11:32.890 --> 02:11:33.890]
talk i've ever had

[02:11:39.610 --> 02:11:42.530]
you're going to find me what they're doing?

[02:11:44.290 --> 02:11:46.810]
well there were some uncertainties in that

[02:11:48.150 --> 02:11:52.810]
Wayne hard me to do a job and he he hard me in a certain role

[02:11:54.570 --> 02:11:57.790]
and i had reservations about going to Wayne

[02:11:58.570 --> 02:12:00.690]
in the middle of the stream and saying wait a minute

[02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:04.410]
because of what i want to do with my family

[02:12:04.410 --> 02:12:09.090]
and because i'm getting married and because uh the time that i want to

[02:12:09.090 --> 02:12:12.870]
spend with my father who's after he's finishing

[02:12:13.710 --> 02:12:15.670]
chemotherapies coming down here in a few weeks

[02:12:16.330 --> 02:12:19.150]
because of those things my role has changed and

[02:12:19.150 --> 02:12:24.310]
and so it was hard for me to to go to him and say i don't i i don't want to do

[02:12:24.310 --> 02:12:27.450]
these things i want to change it around and to

[02:12:27.450 --> 02:12:31.550]
Wayne's credit uh we work through all of these things

[02:12:31.550 --> 02:12:34.850]
uh to where we can accomplish what we want to accomplish

[02:12:35.250 --> 02:12:38.270]
you mean there will be a day down the road when you step down

[02:12:38.270 --> 02:12:38.950]
what that happened?

[02:12:41.210 --> 02:12:44.450]
well i don't think we can speculate about that i don't know what's going to

[02:12:44.450 --> 02:12:48.070]
happen when that day comes uh and i think it would be

[02:12:48.070 --> 02:12:50.530]
foolish and i think it would be wrong for us to

[02:12:50.530 --> 02:12:54.410]
say what was going to happen uh only thing i want to happen right now is

[02:12:54.410 --> 02:12:56.910]
i want us to win a championship and i want us to win it this year

[02:12:57.290 --> 02:13:01.410]
Jimmy football has been such a big part of your life how will you be able to

[02:13:01.410 --> 02:13:03.990]
yeah i i'm stealing you know i say step back

[02:13:06.230 --> 02:13:10.030]
who know i mean i step back another hour but at least my plans are

[02:13:10.610 --> 02:13:16.030]
to try to spend more time uh with my future wife

[02:13:16.610 --> 02:13:23.990]
and uh with my father and my two sons um i'm going to go uh out of my way

[02:13:24.690 --> 02:13:29.170]
to spend more time with them because uh in all honesty and and and and don't

[02:13:29.330 --> 02:13:33.410]
get me wrong i don't regret doing anything that i did i don't look back and

[02:13:33.410 --> 02:13:35.590]
say i wish i'd done this or i wish i'd done that

[02:13:36.090 --> 02:13:43.050]
but i can learn from what happened in those first uh 34 years or so

[02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:47.730]
and i think that i can be a better football coach i can be more relaxed

[02:13:47.730 --> 02:13:53.210]
i can be more upbeat and positive if i have a good family life

[02:13:53.210 --> 02:13:56.970]
and uh and people you know you talk to coaches around the league and they say

[02:13:56.970 --> 02:14:01.370]
well you know first comes uh my religion and in second comes my family

[02:14:01.370 --> 02:14:07.170]
and in third comes football and yet they work at football 15-16 hours a day seven

[02:14:07.170 --> 02:14:10.170]
days a week well that tells me football was first

[02:14:10.730 --> 02:14:13.970]
you know and they go to church for an hour a week so and they're with their

[02:14:13.970 --> 02:14:18.350]
family two hours a week so it looks like to me it was football you know a

[02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:22.250]
little bit of family and a little bit of religion you know and that's how it

[02:14:22.250 --> 02:14:26.490]
tells me what your commitment is and my commitment is going to be

[02:14:26.490 --> 02:14:29.230]
the same as far as getting us to a championship

[02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:33.310]
but i will try to spend a few more hours with my family

[02:14:33.310 --> 02:14:37.690]
so i mean how much question do you know my answer to that is how long do you

[02:14:37.690 --> 02:14:39.550]
move to a championship?

[02:14:41.450 --> 02:14:44.430]
the front of the dollar and the economic risk and the

[02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:47.750]
financial situation? why do you think so much of the

[02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:50.730]
effort was the first move? that's what the professional library is

[02:14:51.230 --> 02:14:57.950]
trying to talk about a situation? well it takes time and you know i i don't

[02:14:57.950 --> 02:15:02.910]
want to stand here and say you know what was here and what we had to do

[02:15:02.910 --> 02:15:09.310]
only thing i can say is this you know we we improve three straight years

[02:15:10.190 --> 02:15:16.310]
we we were able to you know take a team and right now we've got a young

[02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:20.190]
talented team we'll have more money under the cap next year

[02:15:20.750 --> 02:15:26.110]
than probably anybody in the league we've got 40 three or four players under

[02:15:26.110 --> 02:15:29.410]
contract right now and 15 more tenders we've only got two

[02:15:29.410 --> 02:15:32.090]
starters they're not under contract we've got to make some decisions almost

[02:15:32.090 --> 02:15:36.650]
two starters we're in great shape as far as the talent of this football team

[02:15:37.450 --> 02:15:39.930]
and as far as what we can do so this is not like

[02:15:41.930 --> 02:15:45.990]
a fiction team this is a playoff team that

[02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:49.910]
advanced one notch in the playoffs i expected to advance again

[02:15:50.490 --> 02:15:53.170]
you know i was all prepared to say this morning that

[02:15:53.930 --> 02:15:56.450]
you know people should not be disheartened because

[02:15:57.290 --> 02:16:01.010]
the best thing in the world is to be the coach that follows Jimmy Johnson

[02:16:01.590 --> 02:16:04.130]
asked Pat Jones that went to Oklahoma state or

[02:16:04.130 --> 02:16:07.710]
took over Oklahoma state our ass dentists and that won a couple of

[02:16:07.710 --> 02:16:10.530]
championships that mind me our ass very switcher who won a super bowl of

[02:16:10.530 --> 02:16:13.190]
Dallas so it wasn't the worst thing in the world to follow me

[02:16:13.730 --> 02:16:20.470]
you know but uh for some of you uh you have me for at least one more year

[02:16:20.470 --> 02:16:21.130]
all right

[02:16:27.270 --> 02:16:30.770]
we need a couple more playmakers on how things i know that and dan and i

[02:16:30.770 --> 02:16:34.030]
talked about it this morning we know that yeah and

[02:16:34.690 --> 02:16:38.810]
you know i defend our people some because they are our people but we know we

[02:16:38.810 --> 02:16:40.090]
got to get better in a couple of areas

[02:16:44.190 --> 02:16:48.110]
no they will not be coaching the position and it will not be a coordinator he'll

[02:16:48.110 --> 02:16:51.430]
be assistant head coach he will he will work with

[02:16:51.430 --> 02:16:55.470]
all three areas offense defense special things just like i did

[02:16:57.810 --> 02:17:02.010]
you got the headsets on sunday i will both have headsets on talking to the

[02:17:02.010 --> 02:17:02.910]
coordinators

[02:17:11.410 --> 02:17:15.350]
who knows yeah did you pick up the papers this morning

[02:17:17.310 --> 02:17:19.670]
Edwin you probably wrote something you know i don't know

[02:17:20.990 --> 02:17:24.990]
hey hey i i can't say what's going to happen a year from now i can't say

[02:17:24.990 --> 02:17:26.630]
what's going to happen ten years from now

[02:17:26.630 --> 02:17:31.570]
who knows i mean i you know you may be stuck with me forever i don't know

[02:17:32.690 --> 02:17:37.730]
all i know is i know what i'm gonna do this year and i'm gonna coach like a

[02:17:37.730 --> 02:17:38.850]
dick and to get us a championship

[02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:45.950]
all these years you're up to do the full thing about not having enough time to

[02:17:46.750 --> 02:17:48.650]
once you have this kind of

[02:17:48.650 --> 02:17:52.610]
the thought is that there's something that you always have to trigger in your heart

[02:17:52.610 --> 02:17:54.330]
that's that i have to do for you

[02:17:58.690 --> 02:18:09.970]
when i went to mother's funeral i they had the viewing the day before and

[02:18:09.970 --> 02:18:13.850]
i i wasn't able to do that

[02:18:15.970 --> 02:18:16.850]
and um

[02:18:19.750 --> 02:18:21.530]
and my sons were there

[02:18:24.170 --> 02:18:25.850]
and you know

[02:18:27.550 --> 02:18:31.490]
you know there's time that uh you pull back and you say

[02:18:33.570 --> 02:18:35.830]
be with some people that you care about

[02:18:37.070 --> 02:18:39.250]
and don't shortchange them

[02:18:40.010 --> 02:18:42.490]
now they care about you they love you

[02:18:42.490 --> 02:18:45.790]
uh there's support even everything that you do

[02:18:47.350 --> 02:18:52.670]
give them just a little bit back and uh that's what i'm doing

[02:19:02.810 --> 02:19:07.450]
the only reason we had a schedule is because that's what my contract was three years

[02:19:07.450 --> 02:19:13.670]
um who knows what's gonna happen three years from now you know i can you know

[02:19:13.670 --> 02:19:18.410]
i can say that we're gonna win this or win that no one can only thing we can

[02:19:18.410 --> 02:19:22.910]
we can hope for i can hope that we're gonna win a championship in three years

[02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:28.070]
the only thing i did know and i and i truly believed in my heart was

[02:19:28.770 --> 02:19:31.950]
that we'd be better and i think we were better

[02:19:37.450 --> 02:19:38.690]
and i would do it

[02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:45.610]
oh uh finalizing everything this morning

[02:19:51.490 --> 02:19:53.370]
yeah i've told them that

[02:19:54.090 --> 02:19:55.530]
how many times i'll tell you that day

[02:19:56.070 --> 02:19:57.570]
about half of those tongue calls

[02:20:00.430 --> 02:20:02.450]
and that's and uh

[02:20:03.430 --> 02:20:05.850]
yeah again a lot of this has to do with Wayne

[02:20:07.010 --> 02:20:11.970]
because Wayne's smart enough person to see that this can work

[02:20:13.070 --> 02:20:16.010]
and i think Wayne knows me he understands me

[02:20:16.590 --> 02:20:20.630]
he understands my belief in what Dave can add to the table

[02:20:22.030 --> 02:20:25.070]
and and saying hey i'd like to see this work

[02:20:25.770 --> 02:20:29.550]
so a lot of credit goes there a lot of credit goes to Eddie Jones

[02:20:29.550 --> 02:20:30.670]
uh

[02:20:32.790 --> 02:20:36.110]
if anybody in their life they have somebody that they

[02:20:36.750 --> 02:20:38.870]
value as being a really good

[02:20:39.510 --> 02:20:41.550]
a really good person

[02:20:42.430 --> 02:20:45.010]
well you know someone like Eddie Jones

[02:20:45.710 --> 02:20:49.110]
and Eddie and i talked about it last night we talked about Dave last night

[02:20:49.770 --> 02:20:52.830]
and so that's where the process started

[02:20:59.550 --> 02:21:01.350]
Jimmy knew that wasn't going to take a year off

[02:21:01.350 --> 02:21:06.110]
i was going to coach and right and my conversations were really

[02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:11.390]
what opportunities might be present for me uh from a coaching end of it

[02:21:11.390 --> 02:21:13.650]
they really had nothing to do with me taking time off

[02:21:19.950 --> 02:21:24.450]
yeah yeah i said all along you're dan and as i told him this morning i said dan i said

[02:21:24.450 --> 02:21:29.710]
we're in position right now that we've got to be a strong enough football team

[02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:34.510]
that we can win without you having a great day

[02:21:35.610 --> 02:21:40.290]
and there's going to be days that you are going to have a great day like you did against

[02:21:40.290 --> 02:21:44.610]
Denver on that Monday night game and that's going to be a bonus and there's going to be times

[02:21:44.610 --> 02:21:48.470]
we're going to need for you to do that but we have to strengthen this football team

[02:21:48.470 --> 02:21:56.810]
hello this is on this is not a tumor each the one to two hour well all right sports fans

[02:21:56.810 --> 02:22:00.370]
okay twelve of the eight is five sixty w two i'm there have Jimmy Johnson's press conference

[02:22:00.370 --> 02:22:03.650]
with Dave wants that and i'm just wondering we'll talk about a moment come back after the break

[02:22:03.650 --> 02:22:08.370]
i'm wondering about some of the egg on the pushes some of the assholes i heard on the year this morning

[02:22:08.370 --> 02:22:11.850]
this is five sixty q a l

[02:22:16.690 --> 02:22:20.530]
on the

[02:22:20.530 --> 02:22:20.810]
long air

[02:22:20.810 --> 02:22:23.930]
want

[02:22:41.850 --> 02:23:04.350]
здесь

[02:23:34.350 --> 02:23:35.450]
I'm going to have to go back to the night

[02:23:35.450 --> 02:23:39.570]
Do this so soon that we'll have to decide

[02:23:41.550 --> 02:23:44.150]
We'll be now in the middle of the kitchen

[02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:46.130]
We'll be just careful

[02:23:46.130 --> 02:23:48.550]
We'll be close to the trees

[02:23:48.550 --> 02:23:50.570]
You should stop getting hot

[02:23:50.570 --> 02:23:53.270]
We'll be in the post

[02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:54.350]
We'll be here

[02:23:55.070 --> 02:23:58.530]
Three people in long hair

[02:24:06.050 --> 02:24:09.370]
In the wings, this is the guy with a hollow melody

[02:24:09.370 --> 02:24:12.550]
Bob and Graham are the patient hair now

[02:24:15.570 --> 02:24:17.150]
I know why I already have

[02:24:17.150 --> 02:24:19.490]
Four miles after about at 5.60 WD Cream

[02:24:19.490 --> 02:24:22.170]
We apologize for all the extraneous things going on

[02:24:22.170 --> 02:24:24.930]
But hey, we got a program director running around like a bulb of the be and heat

[02:24:24.930 --> 02:24:25.870]
Which he's got a lot of practice

[02:24:26.310 --> 02:24:28.550]
Anyway, so this morning here are your two newspapers

[02:24:29.050 --> 02:24:30.570]
Part for the course once again

[02:24:30.570 --> 02:24:32.410]
Now that Don Smiley is out of the picture

[02:24:32.410 --> 02:24:34.130]
The John Henry deal is final with the Marlins

[02:24:34.130 --> 02:24:35.910]
Now we move on to another piece of crap

[02:24:36.330 --> 02:24:38.650]
Front page of the stunt set in the upper left hand corner

[02:24:38.650 --> 02:24:43.030]
J.J. to resign as Dolphin Ted Coach reports say by Dave Hyde

[02:24:43.030 --> 02:24:44.090]
White on the front page

[02:24:44.090 --> 02:24:45.790]
Not the front page of the sports section

[02:24:45.790 --> 02:24:47.750]
The front page of the front section

[02:24:48.410 --> 02:24:48.990]
Here's the Miami Hero

[02:24:48.990 --> 02:24:50.790]
Right hand corner lead story

[02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:53.250]
I mean here's the presidential impeachment on the left hand with the pictures

[02:24:53.250 --> 02:24:55.750]
But the lead story is always in the upper right hand corner of course

[02:24:56.410 --> 02:24:59.190]
Johnson expected to quit Dolphins by Armando Selgero

[02:24:59.190 --> 02:25:00.490]
Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Hill

[02:25:00.490 --> 02:25:02.350]
Report to the Dolphin Ted Quarters today to resign

[02:25:02.810 --> 02:25:04.990]
Not it's reported wait till you hear this

[02:25:04.990 --> 02:25:08.370]
Jimmy Johnson will report to the Dolphin Ted Quarters today

[02:25:08.370 --> 02:25:11.350]
To resign after three seasons as the teams head coach

[02:25:11.350 --> 02:25:14.270]
And a hastily prepared afternoon press conference

[02:25:14.270 --> 02:25:17.050]
He's expected to cite family reasons for his departure

[02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:20.290]
How do you like that?

[02:25:21.290 --> 02:25:22.250]
Is this unbelievable?

[02:25:22.610 --> 02:25:24.890]
And you see the problem with your newspapers is they have a deadline

[02:25:24.890 --> 02:25:28.770]
So they have to go to bed by you know 11 o'clock at night, midnight, one o'clock

[02:25:28.770 --> 02:25:30.390]
Whatever the hell at time as they go to bed

[02:25:30.390 --> 02:25:34.290]
So for somebody to put this and the front page of the newspaper as usual

[02:25:34.290 --> 02:25:37.770]
Show the ultimate the height in the responsibility just unbelievable

[02:25:38.410 --> 02:25:42.210]
Not it is rumored at least the Sun Senals said Fox News was reporting last night

[02:25:42.630 --> 02:25:44.130]
That that's what was going to happen

[02:25:44.130 --> 02:25:46.530]
But Armando said Gero right here in the heroes

[02:25:46.530 --> 02:25:47.990]
He will report to the center

[02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:50.630]
So a lot of people with egg on their push today right

[02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:51.730]
You said it

[02:25:51.730 --> 02:25:54.630]
And like I said when I came on the year this morning

[02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:56.490]
How about let's hear what he has to say

[02:25:56.490 --> 02:25:59.370]
And especially after what he did have to say

[02:26:01.310 --> 02:26:04.130]
And believe me he was a little choked up there a couple of times

[02:26:04.130 --> 02:26:07.210]
I hate to break the news to you but even I know this comes as a shock

[02:26:07.830 --> 02:26:11.990]
But even people who are football coaches and athletes and we're a jockstrap

[02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:15.570]
Even those people when their mother dies or their father dies

[02:26:15.570 --> 02:26:17.670]
Or their mother dies and their father has cancer

[02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:22.690]
These people actually put their pants on when I get a time and have like living and breathing emotions

[02:26:24.310 --> 02:26:27.090]
I know there comes as a great shock to the sports nerds out there

[02:26:27.090 --> 02:26:30.310]
Who never bothered to think beyond the you know what they the odds are on a game

[02:26:30.310 --> 02:26:32.990]
And did my team win for me to make me feel good about myself

[02:26:35.050 --> 02:26:37.770]
And the swill that I heard coming in here this morning man

[02:26:37.770 --> 02:26:41.910]
I'm going to tell you it's just unbelievable by both the collars and the people on the year

[02:26:44.670 --> 02:26:46.950]
Spineless and gutless and there's and that

[02:26:46.950 --> 02:26:50.710]
Right don't even give the guy an opportunity don't even get to the real story

[02:26:50.710 --> 02:26:52.510]
Thank God for Hank let me say it again

[02:26:52.510 --> 02:26:56.370]
Hey stupid! You people when Hank comes out from Vegas in two o'clock this afternoon you have to be

[02:26:56.370 --> 02:26:58.810]
In fact this radio station when he comes back to town

[02:26:58.810 --> 02:27:00.190]
They have to be kissing him all over the place

[02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:01.910]
Well not tough but I mean like you know

[02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:05.190]
No seriously they have to be lined up at the door to meet you greed to plane

[02:27:06.810 --> 02:27:08.890]
With a welcoming home party for the Humper

[02:27:09.810 --> 02:27:13.190]
Because he's the one that finally you know talk to the parties involved and got the real story

[02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:16.630]
Instead of just you know taking somebody at face value

[02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:20.790]
Or taking some report off of a TV newscast or something out of one of our local newspapers

[02:27:20.790 --> 02:27:22.710]
Which anyone should know better than that

[02:27:24.770 --> 02:27:28.430]
It's like this Pavel Brewery think like I said when I see it I'll believe it

[02:27:28.430 --> 02:27:30.850]
When I hear that it's a fate of compilian it's done

[02:27:30.850 --> 02:27:32.590]
Whether he's coming here or going someplace else

[02:27:32.590 --> 02:27:33.550]
Then I'll believe it

[02:27:36.030 --> 02:27:39.350]
So you can you can get as pissed off as you want with me about ripping our local newspapers

[02:27:39.350 --> 02:27:44.410]
They suck! You can't complain about the journalism in this town because there isn't any

[02:27:46.870 --> 02:27:52.830]
Just a bunch of overgrown kids like Armando Seguero and like a very jackass

[02:27:52.830 --> 02:27:56.470]
And like some of these other people maybe a few years older and I'll know better but they don't

[02:27:56.470 --> 02:27:57.310]
Which is why they're here

[02:28:00.550 --> 02:28:02.790]
Very very pathetic egg on the old post

[02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:04.510]
And those of you callers out there

[02:28:04.510 --> 02:28:07.010]
And I know most of you are still listening that called in this morning

[02:28:08.110 --> 02:28:10.370]
And like I've told you a million times I couldn't care less

[02:28:10.370 --> 02:28:11.830]
I don't go to the dolphin games anymore

[02:28:11.830 --> 02:28:13.910]
You know if they win fine if they lose fine

[02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:16.910]
It's not an important part of my life I just don't care anymore I'm not into it

[02:28:17.570 --> 02:28:21.250]
I get the free tickets those club seats they're great seats I don't use them

[02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:24.790]
So I have no accident round one way or the other

[02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:31.070]
But as so typical man of this town don't even give the guy a chance to listen to what he's got to say

[02:28:33.170 --> 02:28:37.810]
And if I could tell you the number of radio every station I've worked on has been like this every news department

[02:28:38.370 --> 02:28:42.710]
Rush to judgment let's go on you know every time there would be an incident that would happen in town

[02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:44.870]
Like a major incident people call on the air

[02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:48.950]
Well you know let's let's start you know judging somebody on the air I won't do it

[02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:50.370]
I've never did it then I won't do it now

[02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:53.190]
Let's start holding a mock trial on the air

[02:28:53.190 --> 02:28:55.210]
Like Haralda was doing with a John Thane

[02:28:55.210 --> 02:28:57.150]
That's beautiful let's hold a mock trial

[02:28:57.150 --> 02:28:58.730]
Let's convict somebody in the media

[02:29:01.830 --> 02:29:04.170]
Only a jackass like Haralda or this something like that

[02:29:04.170 --> 02:29:05.570]
Of course we all know he's a jackass

[02:29:07.470 --> 02:29:11.370]
But those people call in this morning with their venom and he's got less and spineless

[02:29:11.370 --> 02:29:14.810]
And we knew he would do this well guess what guess what

[02:29:16.050 --> 02:29:16.890]
Wrong again

[02:29:18.370 --> 02:29:20.330]
They don't they have omelette on their face

[02:29:20.330 --> 02:29:23.770]
I'm not talking about from the podcast and over show either they have omelette on their face

[02:29:23.770 --> 02:29:26.610]
Well sure there are probably some people would like when not having omelette on their face

[02:29:26.610 --> 02:29:28.270]
Maybe a few years ago I'm not anymore

[02:29:29.410 --> 02:29:36.550]
But yeah not just egg not just not even a scrambled egg a big fat omelette all over their push

[02:29:38.070 --> 02:29:40.050]
They even look worth a little crater push today

[02:29:41.170 --> 02:29:44.690]
Because they rush to judgment because they believe the bull crap in the newspapers

[02:29:44.690 --> 02:29:46.750]
You think that after a while you'd learn your lesson

[02:29:48.490 --> 02:29:51.350]
You learn that when you read something in the local newspapers in this town

[02:29:51.350 --> 02:29:54.390]
You better check it and recheck it and check it again and again and again

[02:29:54.390 --> 02:29:56.670]
And then get a 10th answer just like this

[02:29:56.670 --> 02:29:59.130]
What George told me about Kodo would doctor to get a second opinion

[02:29:59.530 --> 02:30:01.630]
Which I think he's got a damn good point

[02:30:05.790 --> 02:30:09.050]
Because I mean when somebody keeps putting something on the front pages of their newspapers

[02:30:09.450 --> 02:30:10.670]
Time and time again

[02:30:11.350 --> 02:30:13.510]
Because they're too cheap to go out there and get real reporters

[02:30:13.510 --> 02:30:16.790]
And they hear a bunch of stringers and a bunch of pre-pubescent kids

[02:30:17.570 --> 02:30:19.530]
And pretend that these people are news people

[02:30:20.230 --> 02:30:21.650]
How the hell can they have any credibility

[02:30:23.890 --> 02:30:25.370]
Just like I told you the other day

[02:30:25.370 --> 02:30:26.790]
Michael Jordan's got a reason

[02:30:26.790 --> 02:30:29.530]
I don't know it was actually this was when the NBA settled a strike

[02:30:30.550 --> 02:30:33.990]
And the hero because of their insectivorous relationship with Mickey Erison

[02:30:34.930 --> 02:30:37.950]
And the building of that needless arena there in downtown Miami

[02:30:37.950 --> 02:30:40.070]
We call it crap that they pulled with that bogus election

[02:30:41.290 --> 02:30:45.470]
And the role that the Tony Ritter played in there with Mickey Erison hopping into bed together

[02:30:45.470 --> 02:30:46.570]
Put that one over in the public

[02:30:47.790 --> 02:30:49.990]
So more important than the presidential impeachment

[02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:52.070]
Big story leads to a ratified page

[02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:55.210]
NBA settled a strike and spite of the fact that most people said we don't give a crap

[02:30:55.810 --> 02:30:57.330]
Here in there everywhere else in America

[02:30:57.330 --> 02:30:59.010]
That was the most important story

[02:31:00.350 --> 02:31:02.070]
I mean give me a break

[02:31:04.010 --> 02:31:08.850]
The only thing these people are out to do is squeeze as much advertising out of those pages as they can

[02:31:08.850 --> 02:31:11.770]
And try to manipulate for their own profit

[02:31:11.770 --> 02:31:12.990]
That's all they care about

[02:31:13.530 --> 02:31:15.410]
For their own power and their own profit

[02:31:15.410 --> 02:31:18.390]
That's why there's the non-group in Miami that fits you around the sides

[02:31:18.390 --> 02:31:21.510]
Who's going to do what and who's going to be where and who's going to control what

[02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:25.090]
And that's another reason why you'll never have casino gambling in this town or in this state

[02:31:26.490 --> 02:31:28.870]
Is because these people don't want to lose any of their power

[02:31:28.870 --> 02:31:31.010]
And they're a death grip that they got in everybody else

[02:31:33.190 --> 02:31:34.470]
11 after 1 at 5.50

[02:31:34.470 --> 02:31:38.110]
And by the way just mention this in passing because I know the really important stuff is over

[02:31:38.110 --> 02:31:40.630]
But Henry Hyde is opening up his big fat push right now

[02:31:40.630 --> 02:31:43.490]
The impeachment of the president is the trial is beginning right now

[02:31:44.130 --> 02:31:46.030]
We are blowing out your eyes Henry

[02:31:46.650 --> 02:31:48.290]
Go have an affair with somebody's wife

[02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:50.870]
12 minutes after 1 at 5

[02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:52.690]
If you could find it I don't think you could find it anymore

[02:31:52.690 --> 02:31:53.930]
You think you could find it? No

[02:31:53.930 --> 02:31:55.150]
Some jack

[02:31:55.150 --> 02:31:56.790]
By me

[02:31:57.730 --> 02:32:02.490]
I want to know if my Tyson will fight me

[02:32:02.490 --> 02:32:03.710]
Okay

[02:32:05.370 --> 02:32:07.950]
I hope he likes me

[02:32:08.870 --> 02:32:10.190]
He really wants me

[02:32:10.190 --> 02:32:14.190]
I'll be there if he invites me

[02:32:15.930 --> 02:32:18.130]
For 30 million

[02:32:18.130 --> 02:32:20.130]
I'll be a sport

[02:32:21.050 --> 02:32:23.350]
I'll then wail over

[02:32:23.350 --> 02:32:25.570]
Should he want more

[02:32:25.570 --> 02:32:28.430]
And Tyson can fight me

[02:32:28.430 --> 02:32:29.850]
Like a mortgage

[02:32:29.850 --> 02:32:32.290]
For the boxer

[02:32:32.290 --> 02:32:35.050]
For the boxer

[02:32:35.050 --> 02:32:36.790]
For the boxer

[02:32:36.790 --> 02:32:37.850]
For the boxer

[02:32:37.850 --> 02:32:40.030]
Once 17 at 5.50 WQAM

[02:32:40.030 --> 02:32:40.650]
Oh man

[02:32:40.650 --> 02:32:42.930]
Exactly so we did Mr. Mike Tyson press conference

[02:32:42.930 --> 02:32:44.830]
Where was that on? When did you see that?

[02:32:44.830 --> 02:32:45.790]
It was like a TV interview

[02:32:45.790 --> 02:32:47.290]
They were showing the highlight of it last night

[02:32:47.290 --> 02:32:47.890]
Oh last night

[02:32:47.890 --> 02:32:50.310]
I was at the Maple Leaf Panther game

[02:32:50.310 --> 02:32:51.450]
You think I would be watching that QAM

[02:32:51.450 --> 02:32:53.210]
But anyway, so I'm glad he lost it again

[02:32:53.210 --> 02:32:53.930]
And was saying the

[02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:55.310]
Mother

[02:32:55.990 --> 02:32:57.250]
And the stuff like that

[02:32:57.670 --> 02:32:58.670]
He's a real classy guy

[02:32:58.670 --> 02:32:59.730]
I hope you enjoy your 50 bucks

[02:32:59.730 --> 02:33:02.970]
Maybe you have one of those illegal decoders like that earlier guy

[02:33:03.350 --> 02:33:05.350]
Because in this case we certainly wholeheartedly approved

[02:33:05.350 --> 02:33:06.870]
Because it's worth it twice the price

[02:33:07.930 --> 02:33:09.310]
Your South Miami Beach

[02:33:09.310 --> 02:33:09.530]
Hello

[02:33:10.370 --> 02:33:11.150]
Hello Neil

[02:33:11.150 --> 02:33:11.630]
Yes sir

[02:33:11.630 --> 02:33:14.970]
Oh you know mentioning Tyson you know the Holy Feel real deal

[02:33:14.970 --> 02:33:17.450]
That's what the Holy Feel calls himself the real deal right

[02:33:18.710 --> 02:33:19.230]
Yeah

[02:33:19.230 --> 02:33:22.810]
So Tyson wanted to know what the real deal tasted like right

[02:33:22.810 --> 02:33:24.370]
Yeah and moving along sir

[02:33:24.370 --> 02:33:25.230]
Well anyway

[02:33:25.230 --> 02:33:29.350]
You think about Jimmy Johnson

[02:33:29.350 --> 02:33:30.410]
What I can't understand

[02:33:30.410 --> 02:33:32.890]
We live in a town that's mostly Cubans right

[02:33:32.890 --> 02:33:34.750]
He's saturday of people with their

[02:33:34.750 --> 02:33:35.690]
Siturday of people

[02:33:35.690 --> 02:33:36.590]
Okay have a nice day pal

[02:33:37.370 --> 02:33:37.810]
Jackass

[02:33:37.810 --> 02:33:39.110]
Two open lines in date

[02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:42.290]
5 6 7 0 5 60 and 0 5 60 on the 18th

[02:33:42.290 --> 02:33:43.750]
The Cuban saturday of people

[02:33:43.750 --> 02:33:46.110]
I think this guy's been choking the chicken too much maybe his problem

[02:33:46.110 --> 02:33:47.410]
We have that interview apparently

[02:33:47.410 --> 02:33:47.970]
What what?

[02:33:48.090 --> 02:33:48.470]
Red to go

[02:33:48.470 --> 02:33:49.150]
The Mike Tyson

[02:33:49.150 --> 02:33:50.070]
Okay let's hear it

[02:33:50.070 --> 02:33:53.490]
Mike, Francois Bolthas fixed the one on the dog

[02:33:53.490 --> 02:33:55.390]
Are there any concerns in your part?

[02:33:55.390 --> 02:33:57.610]
I don't know anything about that

[02:33:57.610 --> 02:33:59.970]
I don't know nothing about the number that I know what I can do

[02:33:59.970 --> 02:34:01.690]
How about killing this mother

[02:34:03.010 --> 02:34:03.530]
Okay

[02:34:03.530 --> 02:34:05.970]
How about the 19 months fall

[02:34:06.590 --> 02:34:07.730]
What about it

[02:34:07.730 --> 02:34:08.810]
What about it?

[02:34:08.810 --> 02:34:11.530]
Does it pose any problem to you?

[02:34:11.950 --> 02:34:13.350]
Well see I doubt it seriously

[02:34:15.270 --> 02:34:18.070]
You take into the rings a lot of rings

[02:34:18.730 --> 02:34:22.010]
Does that work for you or does it work against you at times

[02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:25.910]
You know who can't win a fight anyway

[02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:27.970]
What does it matter?

[02:34:28.310 --> 02:34:33.210]
Well for example rage against the event of Holyfield works against you

[02:34:33.210 --> 02:34:34.130]
Well f*** it

[02:34:34.130 --> 02:34:36.010]
You're the fight so whatever happens happens

[02:34:36.590 --> 02:34:38.430]
Mike what do you have to talk like that

[02:34:38.430 --> 02:34:41.110]
Well I've been talking to you the way I want to talk to you

[02:34:41.770 --> 02:34:43.930]
You have a problem turn off your station

[02:34:43.930 --> 02:34:44.870]
You know what?

[02:34:45.310 --> 02:34:47.110]
I think we'll end the discussion right now

[02:34:47.110 --> 02:34:47.950]
Then we could

[02:34:47.950 --> 02:34:49.490]
You got it

[02:34:49.490 --> 02:34:50.870]
Have a nice fight Mike

[02:34:53.550 --> 02:34:56.950]
I'm the type of guy with a big squish head

[02:34:56.950 --> 02:34:57.410]
Oh

[02:34:57.410 --> 02:35:00.950]
I went on my fight except the ones dead

[02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:02.990]
Yes I'm the type of guy

[02:35:02.990 --> 02:35:04.810]
He's counted my distinct

[02:35:04.810 --> 02:35:07.070]
And showed him that he's short

[02:35:07.070 --> 02:35:09.010]
And it's boxing with a stick

[02:35:09.950 --> 02:35:11.030]
I'm the type of guy

[02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:12.830]
Who always inserts

[02:35:12.830 --> 02:35:15.030]
I show Carl Williams

[02:35:15.030 --> 02:35:17.050]
That the truth can really hurt

[02:35:17.690 --> 02:35:19.070]
You're the type of guy

[02:35:19.070 --> 02:35:21.050]
That sings and I'm a bomb

[02:35:21.050 --> 02:35:23.010]
So I just said to you

[02:35:23.010 --> 02:35:25.030]
That you I see you as he dumps

[02:35:25.870 --> 02:35:27.150]
I'm the type of guy

[02:35:27.150 --> 02:35:29.490]
With my leaving and my bobbin

[02:35:29.490 --> 02:35:31.330]
I only lost my fight

[02:35:31.330 --> 02:35:33.470]
And the biggest name was Robin

[02:35:33.470 --> 02:35:35.250]
I'm the type of guy

[02:35:35.250 --> 02:35:37.210]
Who makes the people laugh

[02:35:37.210 --> 02:35:39.230]
And put the man down

[02:35:39.230 --> 02:35:40.010]
You know

[02:35:41.850 --> 02:35:43.390]
I'm the type of guy

[02:35:43.390 --> 02:35:45.330]
Who makes the people stare

[02:35:45.330 --> 02:35:47.510]
Just because I keep all

[02:35:47.510 --> 02:35:49.690]
My traction don't keep hair

[02:35:49.690 --> 02:35:51.330]
I'm the type of guy

[02:35:51.330 --> 02:35:53.650]
And the public just attack me

[02:35:53.650 --> 02:35:55.510]
And if you don't believe it

[02:35:55.510 --> 02:35:57.770]
Then you had better ask me

[02:35:57.770 --> 02:35:59.350]
I'm the type of guy

[02:35:59.350 --> 02:36:00.410]
That's where I'm giving him

[02:36:00.410 --> 02:36:02.010]
What you think was?

[02:36:02.370 --> 02:36:03.470]
I'm the type of guy

[02:36:03.470 --> 02:36:04.990]
Robin could have said

[02:36:04.990 --> 02:36:07.490]
Yes I'm the type of guy

[02:36:07.490 --> 02:36:09.010]
Next fight comes to my face

[02:36:09.010 --> 02:36:11.530]
I'm the type of guy

[02:36:11.530 --> 02:36:12.670]
Who makes me all

[02:36:12.670 --> 02:36:13.950]
Come with me

[02:36:13.950 --> 02:36:14.270]
What?

[02:36:15.350 --> 02:36:16.590]
What is my safety?

[02:36:16.730 --> 02:36:17.810]
I mean, he's a fancy guy

[02:36:17.810 --> 02:36:18.990]
Real piece of human direct

[02:36:19.770 --> 02:36:20.410]
Here's the facts

[02:36:20.410 --> 02:36:21.710]
Here's one of our real chronic facts

[02:36:25.310 --> 02:36:28.150]
That's why I hate press conferences

[02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:30.450]
First of all, most of them are with people

[02:36:30.450 --> 02:36:31.550]
We don't want to hear from any way

[02:36:31.550 --> 02:36:32.550]
We have nothing to say

[02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:34.970]
and number two you can never hear the questioners

[02:36:34.970 --> 02:36:37.650]
why the uh... reporters and the media people out there in the audience

[02:36:37.650 --> 02:36:39.050]
including some way back to the room

[02:36:39.050 --> 02:36:39.750]
and it's always

[02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:40.150]
uh...

[02:36:40.150 --> 02:36:43.590]
you know and uh... so it's really really

[02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:47.170]
bad radio but in this particular case i mean it's a lot of stations it's a

[02:36:47.170 --> 02:36:50.370]
humongous story was on the front pages of both our major newspapers this

[02:36:50.370 --> 02:36:54.310]
morning erroneously incorrectly reported incorrectly reported nice going

[02:36:54.310 --> 02:36:54.750]

[02:37:01.650 --> 02:37:04.590]
i mean i'm embarrassed enough to work here but i'd be embarrassed to work at

[02:37:04.590 --> 02:37:05.330]
one of those newspapers

[02:37:06.530 --> 02:37:09.550]
even i was if i was just delivering it was a paper boy

[02:37:10.130 --> 02:37:13.430]

[02:37:13.430 --> 02:37:16.630]
every morning taken out and delivering the guy that papers let somebody recognize

[02:37:16.630 --> 02:37:17.210]
me

[02:37:20.170 --> 02:37:22.570]
pure unadulterated beyond the shadow of a dot

[02:37:23.090 --> 02:37:24.210]
that's what it is

[02:37:25.850 --> 02:37:26.730]
non-stop

[02:37:26.730 --> 02:37:27.050]
that

[02:37:28.570 --> 02:37:30.010]
here's my baby chill out

[02:37:30.730 --> 02:37:31.010]
yes sir

[02:37:31.470 --> 02:37:34.310]
i was uh... i was watching that the press conference

[02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:36.970]
uh... uh... to me is how they do me

[02:37:36.970 --> 02:37:40.270]
the speaker from the heart especially when you talk about his mother

[02:37:40.270 --> 02:37:42.150]
he got choked up i mean i took up

[02:37:42.150 --> 02:37:46.850]
i mean it's like i said i hit the breakthroughs to people he's a guy he's you

[02:37:46.850 --> 02:37:49.470]
know he's not some kind of a some kind of an automaton machine

[02:37:49.470 --> 02:37:52.550]
he does have a mother and a father and

[02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:54.750]
did have a life while he did have a

[02:37:55.270 --> 02:37:59.430]
but uh... you know he i thought he showed a lot of balls when he still coach

[02:37:59.430 --> 02:38:00.490]
that dumber game and

[02:38:01.070 --> 02:38:03.730]
you know a lot of people could say what they want but i mean he's the right

[02:38:03.730 --> 02:38:07.210]
it is interesting they were not getting for that i had a defendant for that

[02:38:07.210 --> 02:38:10.810]
thing only at least he showed enough dedication to the team that is much uh...

[02:38:10.810 --> 02:38:13.990]
you know and anguish is he was feeling he still felt that that was a

[02:38:13.990 --> 02:38:16.910]
good thing that people expected them to be there and he showed up that's right

[02:38:16.910 --> 02:38:20.230]
i mean you know that in this town you can't please these people no matter what

[02:38:20.230 --> 02:38:22.990]
you do i've learned that the hard way over twenty three years but no matter what

[02:38:22.990 --> 02:38:25.670]
you do you cannot please these people it's never good enough

[02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:29.110]
and even if he would have left and want to see his you know

[02:38:29.110 --> 02:38:32.510]
to be with his mother of any really would have gotten a

[02:38:32.510 --> 02:38:36.850]
yeah i would have you know i mean i'm like anybody else i would have understood that

[02:38:36.850 --> 02:38:37.670]
is mother yeah

[02:38:39.130 --> 02:38:39.930]
but uh...

[02:38:39.930 --> 02:38:43.350]
i'm not here to understand this is my amie he owes them something don't you get

[02:38:46.210 --> 02:38:46.890]
you know

[02:38:48.370 --> 02:38:51.290]
they get in the phone and every day pal you can see the handwriting on the walls

[02:38:51.290 --> 02:38:54.570]
i think what the deal is he's gonna move a coach for another year

[02:38:54.570 --> 02:38:57.470]
then he'll move upstairs and becomes you know wants that'll move and become the

[02:38:57.470 --> 02:39:00.810]
head coach i mean he practically painted that right out there for you but don't

To the other side,

[02:43:18.690 --> 02:43:20.230]
To the other side,

[02:43:21.450 --> 02:43:23.090]
It's what's the lotion in the bag,

[02:43:23.090 --> 02:43:28.210]
It's what's the lotion in the bag,

[02:43:31.510 --> 02:43:32.010]
It's what's the lotion in the bag,

[02:43:32.010 --> 02:43:32.010]

[02:43:32.010 --> 02:43:32.010]

[02:43:32.010 --> 02:43:32.010]

[02:43:32.190 --> 02:43:32.950]
It's what's the lotion in the bag,

[02:43:32.970 --> 02:43:33.610]
It's what's the lotion in the bag,

[02:43:33.610 --> 02:43:35.490]
It's what's the lotion in the bag,

[02:43:35.490 --> 02:43:36.470]
It's what's the lotion in the bag,

[02:43:36.470 --> 02:43:37.770]
It's what's the lotion in the bag,

[02:43:37.770 --> 02:43:40.390]
It's what's the lotion in the bag,

[02:43:40.550 --> 02:43:42.890]
It's what's the lotion in the bag,

[02:43:43.710 --> 02:43:46.570]
It's what's the lotion in the bag,

[02:43:46.610 --> 02:43:52.990]
It's what's the lotion in the bag,

[02:43:52.990 --> 02:43:53.610]
Yes,

[02:43:54.290 --> 02:43:54.610]
Yes,

[02:43:55.170 --> 02:43:56.450]
Wherein' on the TV,

[02:43:57.170 --> 02:43:58.030]
He was come back,

[02:43:58.210 --> 02:43:59.410]
He was come back,

[02:43:59.570 --> 02:44:00.890]
And he always will be a come back,

[02:44:01.190 --> 02:44:02.230]
And like Hank said this morning,

[02:44:02.490 --> 02:44:03.970]
They've had that deal cooked up for this fight

[02:44:03.970 --> 02:44:05.530]
At the MGM for over a year now,

[02:44:05.590 --> 02:44:08.050]
And it was just that they went through all the motions of this hearing

[02:44:08.050 --> 02:44:09.510]
And getting him his license back,

[02:44:09.730 --> 02:44:11.310]
You know, it's just a dollar and cents,

[02:44:11.310 --> 02:44:12.670]
It has nothing to do with anything else,

[02:44:12.790 --> 02:44:13.750]
He can do whatever he wants,

[02:44:13.750 --> 02:44:15.310]
And it still, as long as they can make the big bucks,

[02:44:15.610 --> 02:44:16.410]
They'll still use him.

[02:44:16.530 --> 02:44:17.830]
I thought he was in therapy though,

[02:44:18.290 --> 02:44:19.290]
Yeah, he's in therapy, right?

[02:44:19.410 --> 02:44:20.170]
He's in therapy,

[02:44:20.350 --> 02:44:21.170]
Should be a nice person.

[02:44:21.170 --> 02:44:22.170]
Mm-hmm.

[02:44:22.690 --> 02:44:24.090]
I mean, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he wants,

[02:44:24.150 --> 02:44:25.350]
What do I say, Chia Trist?

[02:44:25.670 --> 02:44:26.170]
He, he, he,

[02:44:26.170 --> 02:44:26.490]
I want to know more.

[02:44:26.490 --> 02:44:27.390]
Well, I guess what, it didn't work.

[02:44:27.750 --> 02:44:28.410]
Yeah, what do they call it,

[02:44:28.490 --> 02:44:29.750]
Anger control, Anger management,

[02:44:30.350 --> 02:44:31.310]
That's what they call it now,

[02:44:31.570 --> 02:44:32.590]
With all these crazy jocks,

[02:44:32.730 --> 02:44:34.630]
Oh, they need to go through Anger management class.

[02:44:34.910 --> 02:44:36.090]
Anybody else they throw them in a guy,

[02:44:36.170 --> 02:44:38.270]
You know, in a slamer for about five years,

[02:44:39.010 --> 02:44:40.290]
For beating up their women,

[02:44:40.470 --> 02:44:41.890]
As these animals say,

[02:44:42.050 --> 02:44:43.350]
Oh yeah, well, beat up his woman,

[02:44:43.470 --> 02:44:45.310]
Because that's a cultural thing, you know?

[02:44:46.370 --> 02:44:47.130]
No, we don't know.

[02:44:48.430 --> 02:44:49.930]
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello?

[02:44:50.730 --> 02:44:51.590]
Hello. Yes, sir.

[02:44:51.690 --> 02:44:52.650]
Yeah, how you doing? Okay.

[02:44:52.990 --> 02:44:54.250]
Neil, let me ask you a question.

[02:44:54.470 --> 02:44:57.330]
Um, Michael Jordan had a,

[02:44:57.470 --> 02:44:58.290]
A mess conference yesterday.

[02:44:58.430 --> 02:44:59.210]
You didn't show none of that.

[02:44:59.230 --> 02:45:00.190]
How come you showed Jimmy Johnson?

[02:45:00.270 --> 02:45:00.750]
I showed it.

[02:45:00.870 --> 02:45:01.570]
Why did you see that?

[02:45:01.570 --> 02:45:03.310]
Or you put it on the air, me.

[02:45:03.350 --> 02:45:03.510]
Yeah.

[02:45:03.830 --> 02:45:06.050]
Because Jimmy Johnson is a local story with Adolphin,

[02:45:06.050 --> 02:45:07.190]
Which is the Adolphin station,

[02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:08.290]
And everybody in this town

[02:45:08.290 --> 02:45:09.690]
Was on the front page of our papers here,

[02:45:09.710 --> 02:45:12.030]
And everybody in town cares about the Adolphin's Jimmy Johnson.

[02:45:12.050 --> 02:45:14.010]
Really? Are you sure it wasn't because he's white?

[02:45:15.030 --> 02:45:16.150]
Oh, that must have been it,

[02:45:16.150 --> 02:45:16.870]
Because he's white.

[02:45:17.010 --> 02:45:17.770]
That's right. I forgot.

[02:45:17.770 --> 02:45:18.670]
Michael Jordan's black.

[02:45:18.790 --> 02:45:19.830]
Thanks for reminding me, sir. Okay.

[02:45:20.070 --> 02:45:21.370]
Next time Michael Jordan is in the news,

[02:45:21.490 --> 02:45:22.330]
Be sure we don't put it on.

[02:45:23.690 --> 02:45:24.490]
Because he's white.

[02:45:24.590 --> 02:45:26.170]
That's why we talked about OJ so much,

[02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:27.610]
Because he's black and he murdered two people.

[02:45:27.910 --> 02:45:29.830]
If he would have been white and murdered those same two people,

[02:45:29.890 --> 02:45:30.910]
We wouldn't have talked about him.

[02:45:30.910 --> 02:45:31.290]
Would we? No.

[02:45:31.490 --> 02:45:33.150]
There you go. Michael Jordan's black.

[02:45:33.170 --> 02:45:34.730]
Oh, my God. Talk about paranoid.

[02:45:35.030 --> 02:45:36.490]
You're more paranoid than Jeff DeForest.

[02:45:37.490 --> 02:45:38.810]
And that's, that's the ultimate.

[02:45:39.010 --> 02:45:40.530]
That's the ultimate slap I can give you, pal.

[02:45:40.750 --> 02:45:42.090]
You're more paranoid than D-fo.

[02:45:44.430 --> 02:45:45.390]
Here's Miami. Hello?

[02:45:46.170 --> 02:45:46.730]
How'd it do?

[02:45:46.730 --> 02:45:47.550]
Yes, sir.

[02:45:47.570 --> 02:45:49.830]
Mr. Blaster looks like a bell to climb.

[02:45:50.070 --> 02:45:50.750]
Oh, okay.

[02:45:51.010 --> 02:45:51.870]
Open line of date.

[02:45:51.890 --> 02:45:54.430]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on.

[02:45:54.570 --> 02:45:55.630]
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

[02:45:55.950 --> 02:45:57.730]
You're on the old hot sauce today, baby.

[02:45:59.010 --> 02:46:00.890]
They're on the big jungles used today.

[02:46:01.930 --> 02:46:02.850]
Here's Miami. Hello?

[02:46:03.350 --> 02:46:03.910]
Hello, Neil.

[02:46:04.010 --> 02:46:04.350]
Yes, sir.

[02:46:04.590 --> 02:46:05.930]
I just called the community and

[02:46:06.350 --> 02:46:08.510]
Thanks for doing such a great job on a brick and storage.

[02:46:08.730 --> 02:46:09.870]
Well, next to one did all the work.

[02:46:09.910 --> 02:46:11.150]
I just had it here and took his call.

[02:46:11.230 --> 02:46:11.970]
That was great.

[02:46:12.090 --> 02:46:13.770]
But the fact that you had it covered.

[02:46:14.190 --> 02:46:14.410]
Yeah.

[02:46:14.410 --> 02:46:16.330]
We're no one else with, when everybody else was

[02:46:16.330 --> 02:46:17.290]
jumping to conclusions.

[02:46:17.610 --> 02:46:19.650]
Right. And the fact is that I kept saying all day.

[02:46:19.790 --> 02:46:21.870]
How come, how about we sit back and see what he has to say?

[02:46:21.870 --> 02:46:22.010]
Right.

[02:46:22.370 --> 02:46:24.910]
Because I was ready to jump to conclusions just like basically

[02:46:24.910 --> 02:46:25.930]
everyone else was wanting to hear.

[02:46:25.930 --> 02:46:28.170]
I mean, this guy was called every name in the book.

[02:46:28.250 --> 02:46:30.070]
I don't hear anybody apologizing by the way.

[02:46:30.070 --> 02:46:31.410]
You're saying, oh, well, you know, maybe I could prematurely

[02:46:31.990 --> 02:46:34.230]
or maybe the media, you know, led me down the garden path.

[02:46:34.530 --> 02:46:36.990]
I don't hear any of these people with the cajones to call and say,

[02:46:37.090 --> 02:46:38.290]
well, I said the wrong thing.

[02:46:38.290 --> 02:46:38.970]
We're out of line.

[02:46:39.110 --> 02:46:39.830]
Right. That's what I mean.

[02:46:39.930 --> 02:46:41.230]
They just crucified this guy.

[02:46:41.290 --> 02:46:42.690]
They gave him a verbal lashing.

[02:46:42.690 --> 02:46:43.970]
And basically for what?

[02:46:44.130 --> 02:46:46.930]
It's not, I mean, did he do a bad job here the last three years?

[02:46:47.050 --> 02:46:47.190]
No.

[02:46:47.410 --> 02:46:49.150]
Every year they won one more game this year.

[02:46:49.190 --> 02:46:50.090]
They want to play off game.

[02:46:50.810 --> 02:46:52.630]
And, you know, and then they got the crappy out of them

[02:46:52.630 --> 02:46:53.790]
by a far superior team.

[02:46:54.070 --> 02:46:55.350]
I just wanted to call you a thing.

[02:46:55.850 --> 02:46:56.250]
Way to go.

[02:46:56.690 --> 02:46:57.710]
Oh, all right.

[02:46:58.810 --> 02:46:59.370]
Thanks a lot.

[02:46:59.410 --> 02:46:59.870]
Have a great day.

[02:47:00.150 --> 02:47:00.350]
Okay.

[02:47:00.390 --> 02:47:00.690]
What do you say?

[02:47:01.030 --> 02:47:02.530]
You said it puts the lotion in your casket.

[02:47:02.890 --> 02:47:03.890]
We have an open line to date.

[02:47:04.010 --> 02:47:06.130]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60 and 05, 60.

[02:47:06.690 --> 02:47:07.990]
On the AT&T wireless line.

[02:47:09.030 --> 02:47:11.030]
Yeah. We didn't carry the Michael Jordan press conference

[02:47:11.030 --> 02:47:11.990]
because he's black.

[02:47:11.990 --> 02:47:14.810]
See, I guess I must like John Connures from Michigan

[02:47:14.810 --> 02:47:16.470]
because he's light-complexed black.

[02:47:16.630 --> 02:47:18.290]
That's why I like Malcolm on the young and horny.

[02:47:18.510 --> 02:47:20.630]
Real light black and just beautiful.

[02:47:21.090 --> 02:47:21.330]
Hmm.

[02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:22.130]
How are you doing, Malcolm?

[02:47:23.130 --> 02:47:23.850]
Where are we going here?

[02:47:24.730 --> 02:47:25.370]
Here's a mobile.

[02:47:25.590 --> 02:47:27.190]
And that's probably why we don't like Mike Tyson.

[02:47:27.270 --> 02:47:27.990]
I'm sure we two dark.

[02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:28.990]
A mobile phone.

[02:47:29.190 --> 02:47:29.470]
A lot of people.

[02:47:29.630 --> 02:47:29.730]
Yes.

[02:47:30.330 --> 02:47:30.810]
What is it?

[02:47:30.950 --> 02:47:31.330]
Yes.

[02:47:32.070 --> 02:47:32.630]
How are you doing?

[02:47:32.830 --> 02:47:32.990]
Okay.

[02:47:33.410 --> 02:47:33.990]
Listen, Neil.

[02:47:34.190 --> 02:47:37.710]
I'm one of those couple of weeks ago you were asking for crossover guys.

[02:47:38.010 --> 02:47:38.670]
They're listening to the first game.

[02:47:38.670 --> 02:47:39.390]
The cross-dresser?

[02:47:39.590 --> 02:47:39.690]
Yeah.

[02:47:39.690 --> 02:47:39.790]
Yeah.

[02:47:39.890 --> 02:47:41.490]
The cross-dresser listens to the listening.

[02:47:41.870 --> 02:47:41.890]
Yeah.

[02:47:42.050 --> 02:47:42.490]
There you go.

[02:47:43.050 --> 02:47:44.050]
Anyway, I have that.

[02:47:44.250 --> 02:47:44.630]
I heard that.

[02:47:45.110 --> 02:47:47.910]
I've been listening to QAM's about 10 this morning.

[02:47:48.250 --> 02:47:48.390]
Right.

[02:47:48.490 --> 02:47:51.590]
And the only thing I commend you, you were absolutely right

[02:47:51.590 --> 02:47:53.090]
with what you said about John's.

[02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:55.470]
I've been listening to you all day, off and on all day.

[02:47:56.150 --> 02:47:58.430]
And the only thing is, is I didn't hear everybody cut

[02:47:58.430 --> 02:47:59.990]
and everybody up dimmy this morning.

[02:48:00.190 --> 02:48:02.330]
I heard a few minutes of it.

[02:48:02.730 --> 02:48:05.530]
No, I heard a few disgruntled jet fans.

[02:48:05.910 --> 02:48:06.070]
No.

[02:48:06.210 --> 02:48:07.310]
And it's up with disgruntled marino.

[02:48:07.310 --> 02:48:09.130]
No, I'm not talking about jet fans.

[02:48:09.290 --> 02:48:10.490]
I'm talking about dolphin fans.

[02:48:10.490 --> 02:48:11.750]
We're ripping them assed.

[02:48:11.850 --> 02:48:13.790]
Because I think the band was out there.

[02:48:14.070 --> 02:48:15.910]
I'm just telling you what I heard when I was coming over.

[02:48:15.910 --> 02:48:16.870]
How about making that up?

[02:48:17.150 --> 02:48:18.910]
Nobody said, nobody said you made it up.

[02:48:19.090 --> 02:48:21.270]
I just said that when you talked about it,

[02:48:21.330 --> 02:48:23.370]
if it's only heard about a half hour to 40 minutes,

[02:48:23.590 --> 02:48:23.770]
it'll hold a whole.

[02:48:23.770 --> 02:48:24.230]
It takes you up.

[02:48:24.390 --> 02:48:25.870]
35 or 40 minutes to get here.

[02:48:26.070 --> 02:48:27.630]
And during the time that I listened,

[02:48:27.850 --> 02:48:30.170]
which certainly there was a lot of calls that came in during that period.

[02:48:30.290 --> 02:48:31.690]
And plus what Joe and D.Fo were saying,

[02:48:31.990 --> 02:48:33.550]
most of what I heard was just,

[02:48:33.550 --> 02:48:34.770]
it was just caustic and slicing.

[02:48:34.770 --> 02:48:36.970]
Yeah, but those guys, Joe and D.Fo,

[02:48:37.290 --> 02:48:39.350]
listen, if D.Fo doesn't stir up controversy,

[02:48:39.530 --> 02:48:41.270]
he doesn't feel like he's a part of the show.

[02:48:41.890 --> 02:48:43.450]
I mean, they're great.

[02:48:43.590 --> 02:48:45.710]
I've been listening to them, and I listen to you too.

[02:48:45.870 --> 02:48:46.010]
Yeah.

[02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:47.350]
And then I go right into hang.

[02:48:47.990 --> 02:48:50.050]
But I got to tell you, every now and again,

[02:48:50.230 --> 02:48:51.610]
the media gets a little out of hand.

[02:48:52.690 --> 02:48:53.610]
Okay, I have a great thing.

[02:48:53.790 --> 02:48:54.290]
Thank you, sir.

[02:48:54.510 --> 02:48:55.150]
I really, I really, I really,

[02:48:55.150 --> 02:48:55.990]
Okay, thank you.

[02:48:56.670 --> 02:48:58.270]
We have an open line in the Broward,

[02:48:59.030 --> 02:49:01.710]
56705, 60 and 0.5, 60 on the 18 years.

[02:49:02.050 --> 02:49:03.290]
What is he laughing about?

[02:49:03.290 --> 02:49:05.170]
What is this man laughing about?

[02:49:05.850 --> 02:49:07.410]
Does anybody know?

[02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:09.310]
Anybody, sit down.

[02:49:13.090 --> 02:49:18.170]
Oh, Santa, Mickey,

[02:49:18.590 --> 02:49:20.410]
the oldie thrive on that arcade.

[02:49:20.970 --> 02:49:22.250]
Our building, Santa Rita,

[02:49:22.770 --> 02:49:24.030]
scores up a happy new.

[02:49:24.790 --> 02:49:26.110]
Happy to a Rita,

[02:49:26.750 --> 02:49:28.030]
somehow don't seem right.

[02:49:28.450 --> 02:49:31.550]
Better ask your phone for financial advice.

[02:49:31.550 --> 02:49:34.550]
When the hands lock down,

[02:49:35.330 --> 02:49:36.630]
there's no basketball.

[02:49:37.610 --> 02:49:39.850]
They're all outstrike.

[02:49:40.330 --> 02:49:42.250]
Ruck's work will play sound,

[02:49:43.070 --> 02:49:46.710]
and insurance chest would show the nice.

[02:49:47.110 --> 02:49:48.690]
Before we use our ass,

[02:49:48.790 --> 02:49:50.250]
take a tan of gas.

[02:49:50.590 --> 02:49:50.910]
Oh!

[02:49:51.110 --> 02:49:52.210]
Like that, that's that.

[02:49:52.510 --> 02:49:53.970]
All right, that's that.

[02:49:54.070 --> 02:49:54.990]
That's it.

[02:49:56.410 --> 02:49:57.310]
That's it.

[02:49:57.710 --> 02:49:58.250]
That's it.

[02:50:11.610 --> 02:50:12.250]
That's it.

[02:50:12.690 --> 02:50:13.290]
That's it.

[02:50:13.290 --> 02:50:13.710]
That's it.

[02:50:14.570 --> 02:50:15.010]
That's it.

[02:50:16.510 --> 02:50:17.030]
That's it.

[02:50:17.210 --> 02:50:17.510]
That's it.

[02:50:20.110 --> 02:50:21.230]
That's it.

[02:50:21.450 --> 02:50:23.050]
143, 143, 143.

[02:50:23.170 --> 02:50:25.070]
Here's a great fact from Nancy,

[02:50:25.150 --> 02:50:26.270]
a big, gym-and-its, friends.

[02:50:26.450 --> 02:50:26.690]
Yeah!

[02:50:26.690 --> 02:50:28.410]
This is when you're giving Hank Goldberg credit

[02:50:28.410 --> 02:50:29.610]
for bringing the voice of reason accuracy,

[02:50:29.610 --> 02:50:30.830]
which he was today, baby.

[02:50:31.070 --> 02:50:32.650]
I mentioned also, gym-and-its.

[02:50:33.030 --> 02:50:35.210]
I heard his broadcast last night on Channel 10 saying

[02:50:35.210 --> 02:50:36.350]
that he thought that this men's JJ

[02:50:36.350 --> 02:50:37.830]
would become general manager in day one,

[02:50:37.850 --> 02:50:38.730]
so it would become a coach,

[02:50:38.830 --> 02:50:39.710]
not entirely accurate,

[02:50:39.750 --> 02:50:41.790]
but at least a better estimate of this situation.

[02:50:41.930 --> 02:50:42.550]
Right on, Nancy,

[02:50:42.790 --> 02:50:43.810]
who else in the world would say,

[02:50:44.090 --> 02:50:44.990]
where you fudge back?

[02:50:45.170 --> 02:50:45.990]
Love that gym-and-its.

[02:50:46.090 --> 02:50:46.750]
I told you before,

[02:50:47.210 --> 02:50:48.270]
gym-and-its is God.

[02:50:48.630 --> 02:50:50.270]
And Hank, I tell you every day since I've been here,

[02:50:50.290 --> 02:50:51.270]
I would go home listening to Hank

[02:50:51.270 --> 02:50:52.950]
until those awful press conferences.

[02:50:53.290 --> 02:50:54.690]
I'm not talking about today's press conference,

[02:50:54.990 --> 02:50:55.550]
but those other ones.

[02:50:55.550 --> 02:50:56.810]
And he made a joke about it this morning.

[02:50:57.430 --> 02:50:58.770]
And I just can't deal with that.

[02:50:58.890 --> 02:51:00.010]
Please, after I get home, in fact,

[02:51:00.030 --> 02:51:01.310]
what I should do is call Hank here every day,

[02:51:01.470 --> 02:51:02.350]
call the producers and say,

[02:51:02.350 --> 02:51:03.030]
okay, I'm home now,

[02:51:03.210 --> 02:51:04.350]
let Hank put on the press conferences.

[02:51:04.710 --> 02:51:05.870]
Because you can't, first of all,

[02:51:05.930 --> 02:51:07.850]
if you wanted to hear what most of these vozos were saying,

[02:51:07.870 --> 02:51:08.370]
which I don't,

[02:51:08.510 --> 02:51:09.150]
but if you wanted to,

[02:51:09.190 --> 02:51:10.690]
you can't hear what the questions are anyway.

[02:51:11.250 --> 02:51:12.850]
Hey, you think a coach can come over here?

[02:51:13.050 --> 02:51:14.070]
I mean, what is that?

[02:51:15.370 --> 02:51:16.990]
Well, but it comes to really getting the story

[02:51:16.990 --> 02:51:18.330]
and putting it where it's at, baby.

[02:51:18.710 --> 02:51:19.570]
There's nobody like...

[02:51:20.390 --> 02:51:21.250]
Nobody likes a hump,

[02:51:21.250 --> 02:51:21.890]
I'll tell you that.

[02:51:22.370 --> 02:51:23.050]
That was funny.

[02:51:24.010 --> 02:51:25.210]
Here's a mobile in Weston.

[02:51:25.210 --> 02:51:25.470]
Hello.

[02:51:25.950 --> 02:51:26.350]
Neil.

[02:51:26.510 --> 02:51:26.910]
Yes, sir.

[02:51:27.030 --> 02:51:27.650]
How you doing?

[02:51:27.810 --> 02:51:28.010]
Great.

[02:51:28.430 --> 02:51:31.270]
Hey, that was watching Channel 6 last night on the Segurdo.

[02:51:31.270 --> 02:51:32.510]
You should have seen his face.

[02:51:33.030 --> 02:51:33.230]
His face?

[02:51:33.230 --> 02:51:34.890]
And he actually said,

[02:51:35.470 --> 02:51:37.110]
I just confirmed this,

[02:51:37.310 --> 02:51:38.030]
a few minutes ago,

[02:51:38.410 --> 02:51:39.470]
Jimmy Johnson is with.

[02:51:39.770 --> 02:51:40.110]
Uh-huh.

[02:51:40.530 --> 02:51:41.510]
Nice going, Tony.

[02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:42.310]
You jackass.

[02:51:42.430 --> 02:51:42.810]
You silly.

[02:51:42.810 --> 02:51:43.890]
I told you he's a silly goose.

[02:51:44.390 --> 02:51:45.250]
Oh, my God.

[02:51:45.250 --> 02:51:46.150]
People are incredible.

[02:51:46.250 --> 02:51:47.250]
And about the Michael Jordan thing.

[02:51:47.350 --> 02:51:47.770]
Who cares?

[02:51:48.050 --> 02:51:49.070]
He's got enough money anyway.

[02:51:49.170 --> 02:51:50.070]
Well, we already knew that.

[02:51:50.150 --> 02:51:51.390]
There was no surprise there.

[02:51:51.390 --> 02:51:51.710]
I am.

[02:51:51.750 --> 02:51:52.470]
What did he have to say?

[02:51:52.570 --> 02:51:53.590]
He's going to spend time with his kid

[02:51:53.590 --> 02:51:55.010]
and have a great life.

[02:51:55.190 --> 02:51:55.790]
You know, and great.

[02:51:55.970 --> 02:51:56.650]
Good luck to him.

[02:51:56.950 --> 02:51:57.650]
All right, Neil.

[02:51:57.830 --> 02:51:58.210]
Thanks, man.

[02:51:58.210 --> 02:51:59.470]
Have a great day.

[02:52:00.790 --> 02:52:02.890]
So you loved Michael Jordan or you're indifferent about him

[02:52:02.890 --> 02:52:03.830]
or maybe you hit him like poison?

[02:52:03.830 --> 02:52:05.110]
But what was there to say?

[02:52:05.450 --> 02:52:06.310]
He had nothing to say.

[02:52:07.130 --> 02:52:08.170]
It's just another stage,

[02:52:08.170 --> 02:52:08.870]
media events,

[02:52:08.930 --> 02:52:10.010]
so they could kill a lot of time

[02:52:10.010 --> 02:52:11.090]
and make a big storm of dance

[02:52:11.090 --> 02:52:12.730]
and try to stuck some viewers in there

[02:52:12.730 --> 02:52:13.490]
because, you know,

[02:52:14.810 --> 02:52:15.030]
I mean,

[02:52:15.150 --> 02:52:16.210]
the only other thing that's going on

[02:52:16.210 --> 02:52:17.730]
is the impeachment trial of the president.

[02:52:17.730 --> 02:52:18.730]
I mean, that's not important.

[02:52:18.750 --> 02:52:19.010]
Is it?

[02:52:19.090 --> 02:52:19.230]
No.

[02:52:19.370 --> 02:52:20.590]
Okay, so don't forget about that.

[02:52:22.170 --> 02:52:23.010]
Open line and date.

[02:52:23.010 --> 02:52:25.430]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60.

[02:52:25.950 --> 02:52:27.330]
On the AT&T wireless line.

[02:52:28.150 --> 02:52:28.630]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:52:28.710 --> 02:52:29.030]
Hello.

[02:52:30.170 --> 02:52:30.830]
Hello, buddy.

[02:52:31.150 --> 02:52:31.470]
Yes, sir.

[02:52:31.690 --> 02:52:33.170]
How about Hank and Hank are there, huh?

[02:52:33.270 --> 02:52:34.670]
Yeah, he honked up a good one today.

[02:52:35.010 --> 02:52:35.810]
You sure they would.

[02:52:35.990 --> 02:52:36.990]
Let me ask you a question.

[02:52:37.070 --> 02:52:38.490]
No, I'll just leave you a group of you on this.

[02:52:38.550 --> 02:52:39.030]
No, I'm just sitting.

[02:52:39.150 --> 02:52:40.150]
Something just don't fit right

[02:52:40.150 --> 02:52:41.950]
with this situation here.

[02:52:42.090 --> 02:52:42.750]
Did you not fit right?

[02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:44.470]
It doesn't seem to me.

[02:52:44.750 --> 02:52:45.810]
Maybe you can agree or disagree.

[02:52:46.030 --> 02:52:46.530]
I don't really.

[02:52:46.730 --> 02:52:47.710]
I just got to understand it.

[02:52:47.830 --> 02:52:47.970]
Yeah.

[02:52:48.290 --> 02:52:48.530]
Okay.

[02:52:49.190 --> 02:52:50.950]
It would bring his best friend down.

[02:52:51.350 --> 02:52:52.970]
Give him a assistant head coach job.

[02:52:53.990 --> 02:52:54.010]
Okay.

[02:52:54.790 --> 02:52:56.430]
He slaps the media with all.

[02:52:56.730 --> 02:52:57.850]
He's going to quit or whatever.

[02:52:58.050 --> 02:52:59.410]
Or the room was going on.

[02:53:00.350 --> 02:53:00.870]
You know what they did?

[02:53:00.930 --> 02:53:01.730]
There was any kind of money.

[02:53:01.850 --> 02:53:02.590]
Wait a minute.

[02:53:02.690 --> 02:53:02.930]
Wait a minute.

[02:53:02.990 --> 02:53:04.110]
How do you know he started the room?

[02:53:04.210 --> 02:53:04.790]
Is there going on there?

[02:53:04.870 --> 02:53:06.210]
The room was, they didn't quote him.

[02:53:06.490 --> 02:53:09.070]
They quoted people, the assistant coaches and people in the organization.

[02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:10.610]
What about, what about, what is father?

[02:53:10.610 --> 02:53:12.290]
His father said that he was going to retire.

[02:53:12.510 --> 02:53:13.470]
He had heard his father.

[02:53:13.470 --> 02:53:15.330]
No, he didn't call his father a liar.

[02:53:15.410 --> 02:53:15.830]
He said that.

[02:53:15.910 --> 02:53:16.070]
Yeah.

[02:53:16.330 --> 02:53:17.270]
He didn't call anybody a lot.

[02:53:19.410 --> 02:53:22.370]
That's true, but I mean, you don't think there's no money involved.

[02:53:22.470 --> 02:53:28.730]
I mean, in regards to where his best buddy comes down here and he gets the assistant head coach job.

[02:53:29.170 --> 02:53:29.290]
Yeah.

[02:53:29.410 --> 02:53:31.630]
In other words, you don't think Dave Wonstell is qualified.

[02:53:31.630 --> 02:53:32.430]
Is that what you're saying?

[02:53:32.430 --> 02:53:33.370]
Oh, I'm saying that.

[02:53:33.610 --> 02:53:34.810]
So what is the point?

[02:53:34.970 --> 02:53:37.470]
Maybe how about if Dave Wonstell came down to your coach for free?

[02:53:37.550 --> 02:53:38.490]
Would that make you happy, sir?

[02:53:38.650 --> 02:53:38.790]
No.

[02:53:38.990 --> 02:53:39.150]
Okay.

[02:53:39.250 --> 02:53:39.650]
Thank you.

[02:53:41.250 --> 02:53:42.110]
We have an open life.

[02:53:42.170 --> 02:53:42.650]
Well, I'll tell you.

[02:53:42.650 --> 02:53:44.910]
Like I said, they're just, they're all looking for an angle.

[02:53:44.910 --> 02:53:46.110]
They're something mysterious.

[02:53:46.410 --> 02:53:48.910]
They're something bizarre.

[02:53:49.890 --> 02:53:50.510]
Always questioning.

[02:53:50.670 --> 02:53:51.750]
I'm not like I told you before.

[02:53:51.950 --> 02:53:54.510]
You cannot come to this town and do good.

[02:53:55.290 --> 02:53:56.590]
It's that's not sufficient.

[02:53:56.910 --> 02:53:58.190]
You must have an ulterior motive.

[02:53:58.430 --> 02:54:00.090]
You must be basically a real son of a bitch.

[02:54:00.370 --> 02:54:00.870]
You must there.

[02:54:00.870 --> 02:54:02.690]
There's got to be something behind it all, okay?

[02:54:04.050 --> 02:54:07.910]
Because generally speaking, whoever you are and whatever you do, we don't like you.

[02:54:09.610 --> 02:54:11.310]
One open line of Dave wanted, Broward.

[02:54:11.970 --> 02:54:14.990]
560705, 60.560 on a AT&T wireless line.

[02:54:15.630 --> 02:54:16.550]
Mobile in Miami.

[02:54:16.690 --> 02:54:16.890]
Hello.

[02:54:18.330 --> 02:54:18.770]
Hello?

[02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:19.290]
Yes, sir.

[02:54:20.050 --> 02:54:20.990]
Hey, Neil, one journal.

[02:54:21.270 --> 02:54:21.810]
Back to you.

[02:54:22.750 --> 02:54:23.690]
I'm a party, too.

[02:54:25.350 --> 02:54:26.510]
Not that good of you.

[02:54:26.770 --> 02:54:29.850]
But anyways, I've been Italy a couple times.

[02:54:30.050 --> 02:54:31.370]
You've been near the lake, Cornwall.

[02:54:31.570 --> 02:54:32.150]
No, I have not.

[02:54:32.730 --> 02:54:34.990]
I've seen Merriol Cormon TV many times, but.

[02:54:35.530 --> 02:54:35.850]
Okay.

[02:54:36.030 --> 02:54:36.910]
There's a good movie.

[02:54:37.330 --> 02:54:39.230]
I've seen Perricone always trying to sing.

[02:54:39.710 --> 02:54:41.570]
Life is beautiful in Italian movie.

[02:54:41.570 --> 02:54:42.070]
You see it?

[02:54:42.190 --> 02:54:42.330]
No.

[02:54:42.790 --> 02:54:43.590]
I heard it's great.

[02:54:43.790 --> 02:54:44.370]
I saw it.

[02:54:44.530 --> 02:54:45.730]
Very good.

[02:54:46.290 --> 02:54:48.990]
And I just want to put my two cents about Jimmy Johnson.

[02:54:49.230 --> 02:54:49.530]
Yes, sir.

[02:54:49.970 --> 02:54:52.430]
I mean, I follow sports, but it's not my life.

[02:54:52.550 --> 02:54:53.990]
I really don't care if he's here.

[02:54:54.150 --> 02:54:54.790]
He's not here.

[02:54:54.990 --> 02:54:56.150]
I mean, I just want to follow this morning.

[02:54:56.330 --> 02:55:00.330]
I mean, this is not the end of the world and these people that are going off the deep end like Dan LaBanford.

[02:55:00.710 --> 02:55:03.950]
And the woman I called Weeping on here in the morning showed this morning like this is the end of the world.

[02:55:04.210 --> 02:55:07.950]
I mean, like you said, sports, keep it in perspective and get a god damn life already.

[02:55:07.950 --> 02:55:09.130]
It's just like Michael Jordan.

[02:55:09.370 --> 02:55:11.330]
I enjoy watching the big deal.

[02:55:11.450 --> 02:55:12.430]
It's going to change my life.

[02:55:12.430 --> 02:55:12.890]
I really don't know.

[02:55:13.090 --> 02:55:13.610]
I wish I had his mom.

[02:55:13.670 --> 02:55:14.270]
Absolutely not.

[02:55:15.250 --> 02:55:17.450]
And yes, I want to hate to break the news to these people.

[02:55:17.530 --> 02:55:18.550]
We play in Chicago anyway.

[02:55:18.570 --> 02:55:19.310]
He doesn't play here.

[02:55:19.310 --> 02:55:20.590]
A couple of games, the eerie plays here.

[02:55:20.790 --> 02:55:21.950]
Other than that, he doesn't play here.

[02:55:22.110 --> 02:55:23.830]
Maybe a game you don't want to weekend on television.

[02:55:23.890 --> 02:55:24.330]
