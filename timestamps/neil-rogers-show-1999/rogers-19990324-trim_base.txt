One ball and one strike.

[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.380]
Whom's into the wind up in the 11 pitch.

[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.760]
Swung on, 7 deep to right field.

You can't kiss or goodbye.

[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.100]
Oh, baby did he?

[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.760]
Yes, that baby.

[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.360]
Out of sight.

[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.620]
Eight cream added in.

WQAM Miami Fort Waterdale.

[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.940]

Oh, baby, goodbye.

[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.340]

[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.420]
Be my world.

[00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.900]
Be your world, baby.

[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.860]
And find me.

[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.820]
Be my world.

[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.040]
So, be my world.

[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.940]
That's when I take out my wounds and it's out all I.

[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.660]
Yes.

[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.380]
For the girls with my world,

[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.900]
Be my world.

[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.880]
So, I'll find you.

[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.060]
Yes.

[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.560]
My world.

[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.760]
Be my world.

[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.120]
Be my world.

[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.860]
I'll find you.

[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.320]
Be my world.

[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.620]

[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.040]
Be my world.

[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.540]
Fort Waterdale.

[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.100]
I want to be safe.

[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.900]
And I only keep it.

[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.700]
Give me an hour's time.

[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.460]
Be my world.

[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.200]
Be my world.

[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.760]
Be my world.

[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.880]
Be my world.

[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.880]
Be my world.

[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.820]
Be my world.

[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.820]
Be my world.

[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.900]

[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:03.500]
Be my world.

[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.480]
Be my world.

[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.940]
Be my world.

[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.460]
I'll guide you up the trail.

[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.720]
She's coming inside.

[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.480]
And all the guys on the beach.

[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.580]
For a real life.

[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.220]
Be my world.

[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.940]
I love everybody.

[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.800]
And you all know the job of

[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.800]

[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.160]
You're the most pretty guy.

[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.080]
I love everybody.

[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:32.180]
I love everybody.

[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.200]
And if I'd done that because

[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.200]

[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.200]

[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.400]
???

[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.660]
So far, nei and I watched illustration match with big, Eve men

[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.560]
with sweaty cracks.

[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.060]
Say we try to grab each other's ass

[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.840]
very nothing more than the tiny jeans strap.

[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.340]
But when they rang the bell

[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.700]
And the match was over.

[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.680]
I couldn't help but notice I had a big phone.

[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.460]
I want to be a wrestler.

[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.820]
And have a man's crotch wrapped around my mouth.

[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.940]
I want to be a wrestler.

[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.940]
Press the lever.

[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.920]
Press the lever.

[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.340]
Press the lever.

[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.140]
I admit it seems a little gay.

[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.660]
It just takes my hand between another man's legs.

[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.220]
But when I pull my hands away, I yet to smell my fingers.

[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.280]
You know that other than sometimes you train,

[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.960]
you don't need to have much of a brain,

[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.720]
as long as it's a shower after you work out.

[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.320]
You can only place in someone's balls in your mouth.

[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.260]
I know that white scenes can be messy and too belly.

[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.380]
That's why they like to rub that KY on their belly.

[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.300]
I want to be a wrestler.

[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.340]
And retaining more runs just like you.

[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.600]
I want to be a wrestler.

[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.940]
And maybe run for governor too.

[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.580]
As long as they that tracks the crowd,

[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.340]
I don't find going down.

[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.580]
Rubbish scenes in their locks with the plumpy queer.

[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.620]
10.5 at 5.60 WQ.

[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.740]
I'm happy Wednesday to.

[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.880]
But I'm a day ahead or is it?

[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.700]
Yeah, day ahead this week.

[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.320]
I was positive but was through there.

[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.380]
Is that like wishful thinking?

[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.560]
Positive.

[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.500]
I thought today is payday.

[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.580]
I thought it's today we got the ball game in 1250.

[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.000]
That's tomorrow, God damn it.

[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.940]
Anyway, the reason I played that wrestler thing again

[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.240]
is we ran out of time yesterday.

[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.160]
And by the way, thank God this is a show we don't have 26 minutes

[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.500]
of commercial spots an hour.

[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.360]
My apologies to the morning guys, by the way.

[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.480]
Now I understand why they have to keep back

[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.880]
and at last break up as close to the top of the hour as possible

[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.700]
to try to squeeze a little bit of show in there.

[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.880]
And thank God that we had like some agreement

[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.700]
even though they backtracked in light about it.

[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.080]
I don't want to say screw in about the number of the maximum

[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.760]
minutes of commercials they could run in this show

[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.780]
before we started here.

[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.860]
And just like I told her right to her a push that screw in.

[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.360]
I said if we let you run 50 minutes of commercials an hour,

[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.140]
you do it.

[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.140]
And she just laughed.

[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.080]
That's f***ing bit.

[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.760]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.060]
So we have no spots, I mean all spots radio in the morning

[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.920]
giving new meaning to the word no show

[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.320]
because there isn't anymore.

[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.320]
Good luck guys, you'll need it.

[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.520]
26 minutes of commercials an hour.

[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.520]
Which you don't take a mathematician to figure out

[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.160]
almost 50% of each hour.

[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.120]
And then you put in the update, stop and think about that.

[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.620]
How many updates do they do an hour?

[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.380]
On a morning show.

[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.740]
Two?

[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.720]
Oh yeah, I think they do two.

[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.100]
I know you don't listen to you do to why.

[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.540]
But I mean I think they do two.

[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.800]
So what the hell is that?

[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.260]
You put in like a three or four minute update twice.

[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.440]
26 and eight is 34.

[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.680]
Huh?

[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.280]
And then of course that silly rejoin music they got coming back.

[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.440]
Well what is that Lee?

[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.020]
What do they got about 15 minutes in there?

[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.240]
Christ almighty, what are you guys complaining about?

[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.220]
Just because nobody's going to listen anymore.

[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.980]
What are you bitching about?

[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.720]
So anyway, yesterday at the end of the show

[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.120]
we were running out of time unfortunately.

[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.700]
We had two.

[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.420]
Now the first guy, the young guy, I thought he was a put on.

[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.540]
Maybe he was getting psychotic, okay?

[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.560]
Because once you start, I'll give you a classic example.

[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.120]
A good analogy.

[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.760]
Sam the Sham our promotions man was just in here.

[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.780]
And I opened up that cool in and book.

[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.140]
The second one, the one by Gary Indiana.

[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.720]
And I showed him that picture which nobody has ever seen before.

[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.980]
Don't buy the book because the last third like I told you sucks.

[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.160]
But go into your bookstore and just kind of peruse through it.

[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.120]
And then look in the last picture if you want to see Kunan in the dead on the bed.

[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.960]
I mean if you're into one of those people, lots of you dead people.

[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.400]
And if you know Sam douchebag our promotions guy and you look at that picture,

[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.780]
you'll say, oh my god, what happened to Sam?

[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.480]
And he walked out of here.

[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.480]
He had no comedy.

[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.240]
He looked at the picture and he just kind of shook his head.

[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.080]
He's going to be thinking about that for days.

[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.720]
That's going to be disturbing him tremendously.

[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.800]
To know that he had like a twin, a gay twin brother.

[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.340]
And speaking of that, getting back to wrestling.

[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.560]
So yesterday at the end of the show, we had two calls and we ran out of time.

[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.320]
God damn it.

[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.120]
Because Hank was on there at the Lipton.

[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.940]
That sounds, you know what does that sound like?

[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:39.460]
The Lipton.

[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.940]
That sound like really fade to you.

[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.520]
You know, I know it's a tennis tournament.

[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.260]
That sounds like real fade to me.

[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.040]
The Lipton.

[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.080]
Huh?

[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.220]
Like a tea thing.

[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.840]
Which it is, by the way.

[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.080]
Yeah, like a little demi-toss.

[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:53.880]
Huh?

[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.680]
It sounds so daisy.

[00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.420]
Oh yes, we're out at the Lipton.

[00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.580]
Oh god.

[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.480]
But at any rate, so this thing about wrestling, which I didn't think was all that revolutionary.

[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.000]
And then of course, Vooka branded that great bit about it, which I think he was right on target.

[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.920]
And the last caller there yesterday, that guy who claims to be a neighbor of mine.

[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.840]
And he made a very bizarre comment.

[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.520]
He said, oh no, professional wrestlers are like, you know, real, I know a lot of them.

[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.720]
And most of them are real fine gentlemen.

[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.840]
Well, why couldn't they be fine gentlemen and be gay?

[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.040]
I mean, I'm a fine gentleman.

[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:22.640]
I'm a fag.

[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.400]
What's wrong with that?

[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.360]
You know, unfortunately, I ran out of time before I could straighten this guy out, so to speak.

[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.200]
Then, lo and behold, in the sports sections in both the Harold and the Sun Centrelous morning.

[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.100]
The all-brow-the-all county-all-broward wrestling team.

[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.480]
Now, I don't-I'm not casting those persons because these guys, first of all, are all high school kids.

[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.080]
That's number one.

[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.080]
And number two, I wouldn't touch anyone with your hand, by the way, George.

[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.040]
But nevertheless.

[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.480]
No, seriously, I mean, I'm sure that they're all fine upstanding young gentlemen.

[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:59.220]
But there are pictures of these guys in these one and these very silly-looking, one-piece uniform, these outfits, these skin tight outfits.

[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.640]
And of course, you do realize the reason that they have the skin tight and coming all the way down to the knee or just above the knee.

[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.320]
And so that nothing kind of like- when it gets you wreck kind of like sticks out, because that would be kind of embarrassing, you know?

[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.060]
Huh? Right in the middle of a wrestling match and there's a stiffy hanging out right there on your thigh.

[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.820]
That would be bad.

[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.320]
Huh? And of course, this way also the opponent can't like reach in there.

[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.520]
You know, like if you were in just like a- like another sports, you know?

[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.760]
Pantalunis, like shorts.

[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.280]
They could reach right in there and then you'd be real dangerous.

[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.580]
So this makes it more challenging, which is why there's so much groping and grappling and grunting going on.

[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.180]
So we're going to take a survey on that today.

[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.040]
By the way, I have a whole list of different occupations and sports.

[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.960]
And we'll find out which has got the highest percentage of- well, you know.

[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.340]
This is Lady of W.A.B.C.

[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.600]
Sick person to Dr. Jack.

[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.660]
Sick person to Dr. Jack.

[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.700]
Slogging your machine cuz there's no turning back.

[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.900]
Hey!

[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.760]
Sick person to Dr. Jack.

[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.080]
I've got no digestive tract.

[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.940]
And my host is dead. I'm no good in the rack.

[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.620]
Sick person to Dr. Jack.

[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.600]
I'm looking very pale.

[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:02.820]
And my host's men stop delivering my mail.

[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.940]
Please help me before they throw you in jail.

[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.160]
Another sick person to Dr. Jack.

[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.520]
I'm ready for the trip.

[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:26.680]
Took me up to the IT and let it breathe.

[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:33.360]
Gotta join tall rolling hook to my rose clear.

[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.600]
Wow, boy, talk about a quick end.

[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.440]
And that's what's going to happen to Dr. Jack.

[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.320]
He's defended himself.

[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.080]
He's in hot water, I guess.

[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.980]
Well, he believes in assisted suicide.

[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.040]
That's what he's doing to himself.

[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.700]
So anyway, what should we do with those tickets, by the way?

[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.260]
We do have a pair of tickets at Greg Reed.

[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.480]
Thank God he only stood as far as the doorway with his mono,

[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.080]
which he's spreading around the building like crazy.

[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.200]
Because he believes in that kind of mono, a mono approach through a management.

[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.700]
And Joe Castello said today, what's up with that?

[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.800]
Uh oh, uh oh.

[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.460]
Joe Costello was out sick today.

[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.460]
What did I tell you?

[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.760]
Man comes in who he's got mono nucleosis.

[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.120]
I warned him on Monday.

[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.100]
I said, he told me about this.

[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.060]
His whole family's got it.

[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:15.740]
He got it.

[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.660]
The reason he got it is because it's highly contagious.

[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.800]
And he comes into work like we need him here, like a hole in the head.

[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.780]
All the way does have a pair of free tickets.

[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.900]
Now the game is sold out tonight.

[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.300]
Big, big game is pop out playing tonight.

[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:27.680]
No.

[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:27.980]
No.

[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.640]
Some really interesting stuff here before I get back to the wrestling stuff.

[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.820]
You know, gorgeous George.

[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.480]
Everybody knew gorgeous George was.

[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:40.100]
Uh, you know, professional wrestling has always been a, uh, you know, always been.

[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.520]
I kind of called here yesterday at the end of the show.

[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.500]
I mean, you know, you're so full of it.

[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.480]
Like I understand that it's a blow to the image of the whole thing.

[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.560]
But anybody that doesn't see this is unfortunately what the so-called straight community can't deal with.

[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.680]
You know, when those of us bags have to point out to them, you know, it's like like disco.

[00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:03.320]
You know, we had to like hold you guys by the hand and drag you right out of the dance floor and sure that disco was where it's at.

[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.160]
And you're protested with all the bumper stickers.

[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.900]
This goes so and you still liked it.

[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.200]
You know, they liked it a lot.

[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.720]
But you pretended they had to put on an act.

[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.260]
You hated it.

[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.080]
All the arts, everything.

[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.540]
You know, artsy, artsy, everything, everything, every kind of clothing.

[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.420]
You name it.

[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.880]
How's Johnny doing, by the way?

[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.440]
Oh, not too good.

[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.280]
We'll see him no more.

[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.620]
Anyway, pop out.

[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.040]
Burry is close to returning.

[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.760]
There's so many things that I find just amusing and amazing.

[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.900]
But he will not be back for the Ranger Games tonight.

[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:30.420]
Will he be back?

[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:30.780]
No.

[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.040]
No.

[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.780]
Will he be back Friday?

[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:39.280]
Well, it says it's likely he'll be back Friday versus Nashville or Sunday versus New Jersey at the latest both our home games.

[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.740]
It feels better, but it's not there yet.

[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.860]
Burry said of his knee after Tuesday skate.

[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:44.880]
Friday.

[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:46.960]
I don't know.

[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.500]
Hopefully it's not too much more time before I can come back.

[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.800]
He said, but we only got 13 games left.

[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.740]
They're only fighting for their lives in the playoffs.

[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.860]
Well, I don't know.

[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.160]
You know, what do I tell you about him?

[00:13:59.240 --> 00:13:59.640]
He's great.

[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:00.340]
He's the best.

[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.340]
But he don't know.

[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.740]
You know, let's not push it.

[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.700]
And the interesting part of it is that the coach, you know, Mr. Hotshot, TM.

[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.480]
He's leaving it up to him now.

[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.540]
It's his decision as to when he's going to be able to come back.

[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.160]
I mean, for 10 million a year, you don't want the coach saying, well, you know, this is really awfully important.

[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.300]
We definitely need these points.

[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.800]
We'd be, you know, you better get in there.

[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:20.760]
God forbid.

[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.660]
And by the way, now yesterday with all these trades, there were 30 players, 21 deals.

[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.800]
Well, yesterday being the trading deadline in the NHL.

[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.800]
And the Panthers unloaded Red Warner, who was another one of those kids who never developed in the organization.

[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.620]
You know, one of the youngsters that you know kept hearing about never played well.

[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:42.520]
And by the way, on Empire Sports on the fan forum yesterday, they said one of the reasons that he liked deteriorated was because,

[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.920]
he really stuck the joint out under Joe Serella last year.

[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.920]
That's why the defense was so bad last year.

[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:48.720]
Joe Serella.

[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.660]
Nice going there, BM.

[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.720]
Man, that couldn't play defense.

[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.220]
So how the hell is he going to teach it?

[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.100]
But anyway, so we got Mike Wilson from the Buffalo Sabers.

[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.580]
Now, swap one defenseman that we wanted out of here for a defenseman that they didn't like it all up there.

[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.820]
They wanted him out.

[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.380]
And I've never, I thought he was underrated.

[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.340]
I don't think he's that bad.

[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.700]
But wait till you hear this about Mike Wilson.

[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.300]
He split into Lindy Ruff's doghouse, the coach of the Sabers,

[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.160]
and the Lindy Ruff's doghouse at times.

[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.400]
He was late for meetings, late for this, late for that.

[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.160]
And that's going to go over real big with Tiam.

[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.520]
And late for meetings.

[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.140]
Oh, you ain't playing tonight.

[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.920]
Late for practice.

[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.420]
Oh, you ain't playing tonight.

[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:28.280]
Late for dinner.

[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.800]
Oh, you ain't playing tonight.

[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.720]
So that sounds like a rare, maybe he's going to be another project in the organization.

[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.900]
So we do have a couple of tickets for that game.

[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.180]
That's not a great read, but what section, what kind of tickets are those?

[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:41.560]
No parking pass.

[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:42.740]
No five row 15.

[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.300]
What is it?

[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.640]
105, 15.

[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.900]
Oh, that sounds pretty good.

[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.220]
That sounds real good.

[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.340]
How do you like that?

[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.140]
I'll give him away to somebody.

[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.120]
And I'm not going to waste much time on that because you know how I feel about giveaways.

[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.880]
But we got him, and since the game has sold out, except for the Panther Pack.

[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.100]
And they're probably going anywhere because it's the hated Rangers.

[00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:59.800]
Let's not let any asshole Ranger fans in there.

[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.220]
And Gretzky is playing tonight that needle nose piece of crap.

[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.780]
I hope that somebody spears him.

[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:04.000]
Okay.

[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.000]
I hope we send the big sparser out there and spear him right in the gut.

[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.520]
Right early in the game.

[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.200]
And they have to carry him bleeding and screaming off the ice.

[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.960]
I give a standing ovation for that.

[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.800]
Can't stand him.

[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.420]
Needle nose piece of crap.

[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.040]
Anyway, Joe to measure.

[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.820]
Here's a letter to the editor, which finally we got a good letter to the editor.

[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:22.940]
And the, what is this?

[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:23.680]
The hero this morning.

[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.060]
Wow.

[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:29.620]
It says Joe to measure was truly an American hero and said many fine examples for our youngsters to follow.

[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:34.940]
But let us not forget that he was a three packet a camel smoker who went on to develop lung cancer,

[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.480]
not unlike others like John Wayne and that King Cole.

[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:44.600]
I beg the youth of America, please don't smoke sign Sheldon Zane, MD in Hollywood.

[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.220]
Isn't that exactly what I've been saying for, uh, since he bit the big one?

[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.300]
Why didn't he do it like Hamilton burger from Perry Mason.

[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.280]
Why didn't you do a PSA and it was closing days?

[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.940]
Maybe his ego got in the way, huh?

[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:03.240]
Maybe you should have said hi, I'm total measure, the greatest living just barely American ball player.

[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:11.560]
And I want you to know that the reason I'm croaking over here and they had to take a long up beside the fact that I'm 100 years old is the fact I was smoking three damn packs of cigarettes today.

[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.500]
And by the way, Marilyn Monroe never had a big.

[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.120]
When I did her, but I sure liked it.

[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.260]
Now that's what you should have said.

[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.860]
Didn't we hear anything about why they removed his lungs?

[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.120]
About why he had lung cancer?

[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:25.980]
No, we did not.

[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:31.000]
It goes to show you what a bunch of phonies and about these Teflon celebrities that we got.

[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.820]
Some people, the man they fart and it's the wrong flavor.

[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:41.280]
Right away it's on the front page of all the tabloids, the major newspapers, it's on e and entertainment tonight and all of those goddamn shows, hard copy, soft copy.

[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.400]
But certain people, certain icons, do I dare use that word?

[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.560]
I wonder how Carl icon feels about that, huh?

[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.140]
No matter what they do, it's like, oh no, his stuff didn't stink, it was just, it was lovely.

[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.520]
And by the way, if you have any doubts about God, I was thinking about this over the weekend.

[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.440]
If there were a God, why would it look and smell like that? You know what I'm saying?

[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.480]
Huh? You know how like, huh?

[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.500]
The embryo is inside like a little, you know what I'm talking about?

[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.140]
A nice little plastic sleeve.

[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:10.760]
You know what I'm referring to?

[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.220]
Very sanitary.

[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:18.120]
Why couldn't there be like a similar little sleeve that comes out every time we had to eliminate it and, you know?

[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:24.140]
And please don't say, see the excuse always is that man was responsible because he eating the wrong food.

[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:28.540]
Well, even pets, I'm not talking about domesticated, even you go out in the wilderness in the wild.

[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.040]
And your animals are like, dropping big loads, okay?

[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.460]
Looks bad, smells bad, they get wicked diarrhea.

[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.000]
You know, that proves there's no God.

[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:44.500]
Seriously, next time you're sitting there, or next time somebody cut, like fat boy, if he walks down the hall, cuts wood in your face.

[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.760]
Or next time you go in the tea room and somebody has forgotten the flesh, you left a big mess.

[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.040]
Just look at it and say, God.

[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.920]
Huh? There's no God. That proves it right there.

[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.280]
Okay, anybody getting back to the important stuff?

[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.820]
26 minutes of spots in our morning show.

[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.940]
I want to salute the little dog and the depots.

[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.340]
Yeah, I almost said, Geldie, I don't want to salute him. He's annoying.

[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.920]
But the other guys, I do want to salute. I have no idea how you do it. Come in here every morning.

[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.800]
You don't have a chance to say anything.

[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:25.560]
Here's our poll question today, which of these occupations has the highest percentage of gaze, homosexuals, divers,

[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:40.040]
figure skaters, wrestlers, swimmer, gymnastic, interior decorators, or broadcasting?

[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:42.700]
Huh?

[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.060]
What? That's very tough. That's nip and tuck.

[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.360]
Which of those do I got? Let's see.

[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.080]
36, 7 of those, 7 categories.

[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.020]
Which one has the highest percentage of? You know.

[00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:58.920]
What about hairdressers?

[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.760]
Yeah, I'm not as too obvious.

[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.660]
I think 7 is enough.

[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.560]
And that guy who called at the end of the show, and both you guys are cold right there at the end yesterday,

[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.700]
stopping in denial. Okay, it's a terrible thing.

[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:14.840]
We believe you.

[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:16.380]
Wingkwink.

[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.840]
Here's a mobile info lottery deal. Hello.

[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.480]
Hey, good morning, Neil.

[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.600]
Yes, sir. I would say all the above.

[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.160]
Well, that's a cop-up. We have to have an answer.

[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.580]
No, I would say, oh, let's go with divers.

[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.040]
Okay. That's my answer.

[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.140]
Well, like we can mention Greg Musainis because he's out.

[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.340]
Right. Let's have I got a couple things I need to ask you.

[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.800]
Are there any great drivers? No.

[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.200]
I got a couple things I need to ask you.

[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:45.300]
Have you heard any more about channels 290, 290, 1 or 297?

[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.860]
I remember you read it something last week about we were supposed to get in the back.

[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.680]
Well, when you say channels this and that.

[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:51.780]
Oh, on the slide here.

[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:52.800]
It's not another word. No.

[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.440]
No, I haven't heard another word about it.

[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.040]
Okay, because I still haven't gotten it.

[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.200]
No. No, I haven't heard a thing.

[00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:57.940]
Okay.

[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:03.600]
No, that, that, but like I said, that was a bill that was introduced, but it's still languishing there somewhere, you know.

[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:04.460]
Okay.

[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.620]
Well, we're waiting to drop the bombs on those barbarians over there in Yugoslavia.

[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.480]
This is something else that they better start taking up, you know.

[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.520]
Right. And you know, I guess we're all-

[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.500]
Why are all these pussy's worried about us going over there and blowing them into the stony?

[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.540]
Does he? Let's do it now.

[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:20.000]
If we were to- like, like, like, come into the set and Godfather won, if we were to nip the Hitler and Munich,

[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.600]
we would have had to go through all that bull crap.

[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.500]
We would have had to come in and more people would come along.

[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:24.140]
That's right.

[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.240]
Same with Baghdad.

[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:25.840]
That's right.

[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.040]
A friend of mine-

[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:28.600]
A friend of mine.

[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.600]
A friend of mine who was a pack of rest of the day.

[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.160]
That I work with.

[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:31.520]
Yes.

[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.860]
He just recently got out of high school that's long ago.

[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:34.160]
Right.

[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.340]
He was on the wrestling team.

[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:35.820]
Yeah.

[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.000]
And he was telling me a story of a guy who was-

[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.560]
Because I had told him what you had talked about two weeks ago about wrestlers.

[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:40.880]
Right.

[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.480]
And I was told him, you know, what you were saying.

[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.260]
And he said that he was at a match one time.

[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.000]
And the guy was doing-

[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.160]
Getting ready to do the mounting position, I guess.

[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:49.420]
Yeah.

[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.560]
And they were rolling around.

[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.560]
And when the referee stopped them and they stood up, he said he had massive wood.

[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:59.080]
And the guy said he didn't want to finish the match.

[00:21:59.200 --> 00:21:59.340]
Yeah.

[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.800]
He said he was going to get close to the guy.

[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.380]
The guy ran off an embarrassment.

[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.920]
I remember that song by the Beatles, massive wood.

[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.320]
He said you had to have been there to really appreciate it.

[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.100]
And in closing.

[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:10.560]
Yes.

[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.640]
I know a big black guy named Wayne.

[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.020]
He said douchebag.

[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:14.460]
Okay.

[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:15.260]
Thanks.

[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:15.680]
Yeah.

[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.720]
And as a matter of fact, I don't want to turn this into a racial thing or the white hell not.

[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:19.180]
You know.

[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.080]
But I look at these pictures.

[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:21.360]
I do.

[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.200]
We got to do another break.

[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:22.900]
Christ almighty.

[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.860]
But look at the high percentage of a dark-complicated guys in this Broward County All-County

[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:28.560]
Wrestling team.

[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:33.320]
In fact, last week when we first brought this up a couple weeks ago, I noticed that a lot of dark-complicated

[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.020]
collars out there were calling it about this.

[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.100]
And of course, the honest ones they agreed with me.

[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.420]
They said, oh, yeah, they're all a bunch of facts.

[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:39.460]
But, huh?

[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:40.740]
Well, not all.

[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:41.340]
Just many.

[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:41.780]
Several.

[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:42.380]
A lot of things.

[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.140]
And what kind of a, you know, wouldn't you get it?

[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:44.980]
I mean, look at how big.

[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:48.020]
Talk about a big black guy named Schuferl.

[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.540]
Look at that.

[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.980]
I mean, look at this guy.

[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.500]
Would you let him mount you?

[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:54.120]
Huh?

[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:59.360]
Would you get willing to get down on all fours and say, okay, mount me, baby.

[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.820]
I mean, what the hell is that?

[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.800]
Talk about your modicone and cheese.

[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:10.900]
What the hell is that?

[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:30.960]
I want thenya roll and the goo froste !

[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.780]
I-I said, I'm pretty poor, like, did've gone so far.

[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:34.780]

[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:34.780]

[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:34.780]

[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:42.400]
She thought it was good till I went out by morning work.

[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:48.460]
She asked me how long it was going and I started the last.

[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:56.420]
It's bigger than fire, it's shrinks when you pee in the bath.

[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:07.220]
But when I woke my f*** was lost, she shrugged it off.

[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:15.180]
So I torched her house, she better not f***ed by morning work.

[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.200]
We're here by morning work.

[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:28.860]
Okay, 1033 at 560 WQM, here's the fact that you can also give your vote by fax on this.

[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:29.860]
It's a very important poll.

[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.100]
Our fax number 305 650198 by the way.

[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.660]
Oh, for a minute there I thought I'd give out.

[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:44.020]
So here's the first fact that says without a doubt, figure skating is more fags proportionally.

[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.340]
It's the number one gay sport wrestling comes in a very close second.

[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.640]
And this is obviously from somebody knows what they're talking about.

[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.340]
What's seriously, would you let that big black guy named...

[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.700]
Yeah, fill in the blank, whatever his name be.

[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.840]
Mount you, would you get down on your hands and eat?

[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.060]
I mean, I don't want to make it sound racial, but I mean some of these guys, like Roy Foster for quite a lot.

[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:09.560]
We've all seen a good guy, but I don't think there's anybody in this building that would get down on all four as well.

[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.540]
Oh boy, I guess I have to take that back.

[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.400]
You know, it's interesting.

[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.920]
We were all going down to see my new car yesterday, George and Joe and yours truly.

[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:21.240]
Huh?

[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.660]
And we got to the bottom of the elevator.

[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.480]
And there was Roy with someone.

[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.800]
And everybody was kind of like sniggering about it.

[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.200]
Were we?

[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:37.700]
Huh?

[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.500]
I don't want to say who she was.

[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.900]
So your face is purple now, not just red, it's purple.

[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:46.860]
And your face, too, it was such a scene.

[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.820]
It was, everybody was going.

[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:50.540]
Oh my god.

[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:52.480]
Holy Toledo.

[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.460]
That's just all those rumors, I'm sure.

[00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.260]
So like I said, other than maybe that person, is there anybody else in this building that would say,

[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.380]
okay, I'm going to get down on the floor on all fours and let Roy mount me?

[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:03.700]
No.

[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.780]
No, I don't think so.

[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:05.540]
Not this kid.

[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.300]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:09.540]

[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:10.540]
Neil.

[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:11.600]
Yes sir.

[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:12.540]
Neil.

[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:13.000]
Yes.

[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:13.920]
Good morning.

[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:14.700]
Good morning.

[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.240]
On the pole question, I'll go with the hairdresser for another of the women ones.

[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.100]
Hairdressers isn't on my survey.

[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.680]
That was George Trudellet in there.

[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.480]
It's not on the survey.

[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:24.200]
Oh.

[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:29.600]
Divers, figure skaters, wrestlers, swimmers, gymnastics, interior decorators or broadcasters.

[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.900]
Listen, I got a friend at work at the Margate Fire Department.

[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.220]
I'm not going to say any name.

[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.060]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.780]
I left a paramedics and firefighters.

[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:38.820]
Okay, wait a minute.

[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:39.200]
Okay.

[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.060]
Anyway, they got it all.

[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.040]
They got a fire truck that they're dismantling.

[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:47.420]
They're going to take the light off the top and ship it to the, to the, uh,

[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:48.000]
Macarena.

[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:48.920]
The Macer.

[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.100]
So we can actually see it if we ever score a goal if Pavel ever comes back.

[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.100]
Okay, thanks for the good news.

[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:53.620]
Good new phone.

[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.680]
Yeah, thanks to him.

[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.740]
The paramedics and firefighters will let those off the list.

[00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:03.480]
Very highly infiltrated with, uh, well, you know, we're going to give those tickets away sometime between now and, uh,

[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.320]
whenever we feel like it because the game has sold out to none except at the Panther Pack.

[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.580]
I'm sure they're all gone right now.

[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:08.960]
There's a little bit of fever in the air.

[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:09.800]
Is there fever in the air?

[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:09.960]
No.

[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:10.580]
Can you smell it?

[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:10.780]
No.

[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:11.400]
I don't think so.

[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.840]
But for some reason, they all show up.

[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.480]
You know, I mean, let's, let's give them credit where credit is due.

[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.400]
We've had real good crowds all year in the Macarena.

[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.120]
I don't know what it is.

[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.280]
They're not paying too much attention to the game and that probably won't change for years.

[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.640]
But, uh, we do show up.

[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.280]
Nevertheless, a little, I'm just a crestfallen that Pavel ain't coming back.

[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.740]
And, you know, like he said, when he's good and ready, you know,

[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:36.240]
for 10 million a year, when he's good and ready, that's when he's going to come back.

[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.020]
You know, we love him.

[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:37.920]
He's the Russian rocket.

[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:38.380]
He's great.

[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.200]
He's exciting.

[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.180]
And that's, you know, that's why he hoped that he's playing.

[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.100]
Not just because we need to win and because in order to make them playoffs, it's desperate.

[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.800]
It's like they say crunch time.

[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.480]
Please don't say crunch time again.

[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:49.620]
We'll shoot you if you say that again.

[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.320]
But they do say that it's, this is the big one.

[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:52.700]
Okay.

[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:53.460]
This is gigantic.

[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:59.320]
This is a chance to stick to really nail the Rangers to, uh, put it to him.

[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.140]
This would be the final nail in their coffin or in their wrist.

[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.180]
If I can say that in their palm, huh?

[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:09.060]
Right before Easter, put a nail in their palms for those obnoxious Rangers whom we hate like poison.

[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.380]
But Pavel, he's, uh, don't feel exactly like he wants it to feel and isn't the end exactly right either.

[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:16.280]
Here's Boker.

[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:16.580]
Hello.

[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.280]
Daniel.

[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:17.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.320]
I gave it a shot before your first bit was over.

[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.320]
Yeah, I called him the ticket line.

[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:22.720]
It was.

[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:23.180]
Sorry.

[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.520]
I told you to pamph the pack.

[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.460]
I mean, this is a big one.

[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.460]
You know, this Ranger thing.

[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.460]
We hate them like poison.

[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.080]
Yes, you do.

[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.560]
And also we want to make sure that all the Panther fans buy up all the tickets.

[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.480]
See, that's one of the good things the last couple of years.

[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:37.200]
In the first, uh, four years we had the team, you'll probably remember we had all those Ranger assholes,

[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.920]
Ranger outfit, millions of them.

[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:43.000]
And, uh, you know, we'd be going, let's go, Panthers, and they're going, let's go, Rangers to be like 50-50.

[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:48.260]
We finally wise up and everybody, all the Ranger haters decided to buy up the tickets to make sure they can't get in.

[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.060]
So I don't know how many close fights I've gotten in with people like things up to my wife and stuff.

[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.620]
It was just, the New York people are pretty bad.

[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.300]
But that's one, I wanted to go and squelch out their, uh, Ranger chant.

[00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:58.860]
Yeah.

[00:28:58.860 --> 00:28:59.840]
I have a real big mouth.

[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:00.360]
Uh-huh.

[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:04.080]
And, uh, I want to put it in, if I could add a category, maybe professional wrestling?

[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.540]
Well, that's what I meant.

[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.260]
Oh, okay.

[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.780]
I'm certainly not suggesting that high school and college wrestlers are gay.

[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.260]
I wouldn't suggest that.

[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:16.400]
I do know there was definitely no God this morning when I looked in the paper and need him, I was still on our team.

[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:16.920]
Yeah.

[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.900]
I was praying that he would be created.

[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.100]
What's the praying you'll say?

[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.060]
No takers, I don't think.

[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.920]
I'm praying you'll give me the tickets.

[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:23.340]
No.

[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:24.660]
Okay.

[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.820]
Uh, it's 22 before, uh, what are you laughing about?

[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:28.860]
I mean, I hear it was pretty weak.

[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.560]
He's a good guy.

[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.120]
He wants to go, but it was pretty weak material.

[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:35.780]
I like when we give it, which we very rarely almost never give anything away again, because it kills the show.

[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.660]
But the way things are going to last a few days.

[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.080]
And I'm beginning to understand why we got all spots radio.

[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:45.040]
I mean, that morning show, those poor guys in there, you see, they're probably doing this to them.

[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.700]
Uh, you know, something that reminds me of when we're near, when they were trying to blow him out.

[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.900]
I don't want to get Jeff Perinoid, because Nodifo is a very paranoid insecure guy.

[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:56.200]
I mean, when you're terrified of rumor, you know how insecure you are.

[00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.660]
But when they were trying to push Reniri out, they started like limiting the amount of airtime.

[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.720]
In other words, they come up with all these extra features and news and spots.

[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.400]
And so basically, a Reniri was on like two minutes an hour.

[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:07.460]
And that was it.

[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:09.780]
And then that didn't work.

[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:10.880]
You know, he didn't bail out of there.

[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.420]
So they finally said, oh, we'll pay for a year.

[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.020]
Don't come back.

[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.180]
And he said, okay, Uga Buga.

[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:16.540]
He didn't come back.

[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.060]
So that's one of the things they do.

[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.880]
I think the other thing maybe since now we're getting close to the baseball season,

[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.680]
that since they're having a tremendously difficult time.

[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.700]
And of course, uh, the support grid reads ego is the sports maven.

[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:32.700]
We got to put all these, uh, bum fork sports events on the year, which they can't sell.

[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:37.040]
So, you know, you got to give out bonus spots and, you know, a dollar or a holler and ten bucks a pop.

[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:40.960]
And anything to try to fill up the spots on those Marlon games, like the exhibition game,

[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.140]
we got a 1250 tomorrow afternoon.

[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.140]
Oh, God.

[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.460]
And Marlon's in the Cardinals.

[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.220]
That should make Dave the cop happy.

[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.040]
He'll be the only one listening to that crap.

[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.920]
By the way, today we got Hank at Chula's 2 to 6.

[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.980]
We got the Boobster 6 to 7 o'clock tonight.

[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.280]
Right back in the dinner hour.

[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.680]
Talk about what he knows best.

[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.340]
Ticking out.

[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:00.780]
And then we got the pregame show at 7 Rangers in the Panther.

[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.160]
7th or 8th of the night from the Mac Arena.

[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.600]
First of three home games.

[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.420]
It's about time.

[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:09.460]
Feel like it's been an eternity since we've been in that arena seeing our team do whatever it is they do.

[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:10.600]
Shhhhhhh!

[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.200]
That's the view!

[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.240]
7 to 9!

[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:13.160]
Get it, you guys!

[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.000]
I'm here to you.

[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.840]
Frank's a hot village.

[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.780]
I'm your full piece of a falling thing.

[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.020]
Hey, hey, hey.

[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.720]
I'm called by you.

[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:58.060]
Bobbie, remember to drop down to your knees and pray away.

[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.680]
Oi, oye, babe.

[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.240]
I'm not too much in show, he's ever gone.

[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.820]
Yo, it's here better than just yo.

[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.400]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.760]
I thank you, you jacky robber.

[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.580]
Hey, the way for only you go pro.

[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.160]
Yo, yo, yo.

[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.840]
Yo, yo, yo.

[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]
After four questions today by the way, who gives better head professional wrestlers or interior decorators?

[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.540]
1045 at 560 WQM.

[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:35.140]
And here's some stuff that came over the fax mischanges now from the internet, no less,

[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.020]
which usually I throw that stuff in the waste basket.

[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:37.960]
This is pretty interesting.

[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:45.940]
How the Reverend Jerry Fowlball and the California Political Organization helped finance and orchestrate an extensive anti-Cletan propaganda campaign.

[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:55.460]
A conservative political organization with ties to the Reverend Jerry Fowlball can covertly pay more than 200 grand to individuals who made damaging allegations about the president's personal conduct.

[00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:03.940]
The money was paid out over a three year period between 1994 and 1996 by citizens for honest government, headquartered in Orange County, California.

[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.200]
Home of the favorite fascist of the world.

[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:11.860]
The payments are detailed in the organization's confidential counting ledgers and other internal records.

[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:20.620]
The payments in the allegations, some of which were either fabricated or grossly exaggerated, were part of a covert and sophisticated political propaganda effort to influence public opinion against the president.

[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:21.500]
How do you like that?

[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.960]
Huh? This is the same Jerry Fowlball that's worried about Tinky Winky and his purple people leader.

[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:30.460]
Very believable.

[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.300]
Okay, what are we going to do about giving away those pantheon tickets?

[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.720]
We're going to give them away or not.

[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:42.500]
That game is, I mean, the Panther Packer gone every ticket, every seat, every nook and cranny that you went to and I sold out.

[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.680]
Because this is the big one, baby.

[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.600]
This is, as they say, crunch time.

[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.340]
By the way, if you're wondering why I'm playing these jingles.

[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:54.340]
Because our car check in here, it turns out that those worn out heads.

[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.460]
Now, what are those? Those are the record heads, which these don't record.

[00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:58.900]
What are they?

[00:33:59.320 --> 00:33:59.800]
What is it?

[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.560]
These were obviously taken.

[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.820]
But they do date these machines.

[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.940]
They show it there from like before Maracone was a baby.

[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:12.080]
But nevertheless, our crack engineer came yesterday, flipped the switch here or two were there and now they're working like crazy.

[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.280]
Why not?

[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.080]
Yeah, but you made it in the sky.

[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:17.480]
Oh!

[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.840]
Yeah, let's go down to your jingles and play some cards, people there.

[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.100]
Because these cards eventually look like we're out.

[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:25.020]
You know, there will be a history.

[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.180]
There won't be any more cards.

[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.060]
Won't that be sad?

[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.400]
The day the cards died.

[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.360]
Oh, and speaking of jingles, by the way, so Bluff Lindy was in here this morning, briefly.

[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.980]
And said we got a jingle package from the last QAM jingle package back in 1992.

[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.960]
Now, we'll play some of these today and they're actually pretty good.

[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.800]
I like them better than some of the crap we're playing now.

[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:46.600]
But you know that you're a loser.

[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.540]
You know that question, how do you know when you're a loser?

[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:55.260]
You know you're a loser when a station orders a jingle package and the singers who sing the jingles, mispronounce your name.

[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:57.940]
Then you know you're a loser.

[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.760]
Ed Berliner, unforged radio, I'm 60 W.

[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:07.000]
And Ed Berliner, who of course everybody says about him.

[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:07.680]
He's an asshole.

[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.560]
Oh, is he ever?

[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:09.440]
I mean, he is.

[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:15.420]
Of all the people I've ever met in this business, I think he might, he's definitely, if not on the top four or five, bubbling under.

[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.480]
He's right up there at the top.

[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:17.680]
Really, Ed Berliner?

[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:18.540]
He's an asshole.

[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:19.560]
Ed Berliner.

[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:26.940]
So he was on this station, which of course along with John Moynihan, a lot of other losers, which is why they were doing fractions in the ratings until he brought some real broadcasters over here.

[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.740]
Like Diffle and Geltie.

[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.680]
Well, like Diffle, like I said.

[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:37.300]
J for Mont, unforged radio, I'm 50 W.

[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:44.440]
Ed Berliner, unforged radio, I'm 50 W.

[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:46.840]
Ed Berliner, baby.

[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.780]
Man, they must have known you an asshole.

[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.620]
They must have known everybody hates you like poison.

[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.140]
What a loser.

[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.640]
He is. He is such a, such a geek.

[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.440]
Okay, where we going?

[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.860]
Let's take a caller to ICB God.

[00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:58.960]
Never gave the numbers out today.

[00:35:59.080 --> 00:35:59.680]
By the way, that's good.

[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.360]
That's a good sign.

[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.380]
See, these phones are fine.

[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.080]
It's just the audience.

[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.120]
It's in the big, I heard Yankees today again.

[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.660]
He's out there at the Lichten.

[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:06.720]
He's out there at the Lichten.

[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.400]
And everything, I went to my mother's for lunch.

[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.020]
I get in the car.

[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:10.720]
I'm going there.

[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.280]
I'm back in the car to go home.

[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:17.500]
And every time I get in there, Yankees, we got any calls and they're saying, you know, there was like maybe one I heard.

[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.100]
We're going through a coma time now.

[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.940]
This town's having an identity crisis.

[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.360]
Here's Kindle.

[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:23.500]
Hello.

[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:24.960]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:25.360]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.500]
We go with Mufftabr.

[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.060]
I mean, divers.

[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:27.800]
Yeah.

[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:28.580]
Okay.

[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.300]
And I don't know if you saw it.

[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:31.840]
You all referring to Greg Lucenas for you?

[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:33.580]
Of course.

[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.840]
Yeah, with your poll question.

[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:36.220]
Uh-huh.

[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:37.100]
With his poll?

[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:43.560]
A couple weeks ago, I don't know if you saw there was a report on like, big line or whether it shows about high school girls in wrestling.

[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:44.540]
Bikes?

[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:50.000]
Yeah, about how in Massachusetts, high school athletic association is letting girls wrestle.

[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.680]
And they can't start their own teams because there's not enough girls, but they're letting them wrestle with a guy.

[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.460]
Why don't we have like, co-ed wrestling so we can have something for the straight kids to do?

[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.600]
Well, they're doing it.

[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.060]
It's co-ed.

[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:01.440]
It's mixed.

[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:02.900]
Oh, it is co-ed.

[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:05.520]
It's mixed because there's not enough girls to start their own league.

[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:06.440]
All right.

[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:06.860]
All right.

[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:07.300]
There you go.

[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:11.860]
I think, you know, this poor straight bastards have been so repressed. It's about time we let them start wrestling with their conscience.

[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:12.880]
No one's mentioned that yet?

[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:13.400]
No, yeah.

[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:17.280]
Basically, what the whole thing was about it should have be allowed and they interviewed all the parents of the girls.

[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:17.780]
Why not?

[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:18.640]
They're all totally...

[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.680]
Why not? What's wrong with that?

[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.640]
Well, the thing is, they interviewed the boys and the boy hated it because they say,

[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:30.240]
if you win, well, you should win because you get a girl and if you lose, they're embarrassed because, you know, you should lose to a girl.

[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.860]
Who cares if you lose if you're getting a little action? Who cares about that?

[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:36.320]
See, those are the faggots. The guys that say we don't want to do it because we don't want to be embarrassed.

[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.940]
Those are the guys that should be on the guys' wrestling team.

[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.360]
Well, the fighting is the odd demand.

[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:44.400]
You told me a straight guy that don't want to run unless they're pigs, unless they're bull dicks, really grotesque.

[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.020]
And bull dicks wouldn't want to wrestle with guys anyway.

[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:51.780]
As the peace ended, they asked the interview asked both the boys and the girls should...

[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.640]
First they asked the girls, aren't you worried about the guys copying a feel or anything?

[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:55.580]
What's wrong with that?

[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.980]
The girls said, no, we haven't felt anything, no sexual touching yet at all.

[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:04.000]
And what better protection could you possibly get than those tights, those skin tight outfits that they wear?

[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.640]
When they asked the boys, now one of the boys said they were thinking about that.

[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.300]
They were all like, no, we're not thinking about that at all.

[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:12.860]
We're totally focused on just pinning the girl down.

[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:15.360]
And we're totally focused on pinning her ass down, right?

[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.420]
So maybe wrestling at the close second.

[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.760]
Okay, thanks for the good news.

[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.500]
You're going to have a great life.

[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:20.040]
There you go.

[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:20.940]
Yes!

[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.360]
Finally got something for those poor straight athletes to do, huh?

[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:24.960]
It's about time.

[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.740]
Because football, we know how faggy that is.

[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:31.120]
And of course, when you say that in America, oh, especially here, they get real upset.

[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.200]
By the way, how's Tony Martin?

[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.220]
Are they letting him out or what?

[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:39.340]
I was just thinking, you know, and of course, Tony is asking, well, you know, all those charges and everything.

[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.040]
Let's hold off to laughter this season, you know?

[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.320]
Because he's got to play and make 4.5 million or so.

[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:48.880]
Maybe we can get Lawrence Phillips back and Bobby Humphrey and Sammy Smith and Mark Duporgan,

[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:49.560]
so I'm going to hand him up again.

[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:53.420]
How about the Dolphin's having all criminal teams sounds good to me or alleged anyway?

[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:58.240]
And the fans would still show up and say, hey, we got the best criminal in the other country.

[00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:58.920]
We love him.

[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:06.040]
Divers, figure skaters, professional wrestlers, swimmers, gymnastics, interior decorators,

[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.760]
paramedics, firefighters, or broadcasters.

[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.920]
I've known a couple of straight guys in this business.

[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:17.560]
Stan Major, Phil Henry, Mike Winnery, trying to think of any others.

[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.280]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.080]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:21.800]
How are you doing?

[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:22.080]

[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.940]
I guess you would think much about Dave Lovante.

[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.460]
What do you mean by that?

[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:31.500]
Well, you know, when you played the Dave Lovante, you know, I mean, I really don't know much about Dave.

[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.960]
I like him. He's a friend of mine. He's a good guy.

[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.680]
Oh, well, I know I like ball games, but a real good guy.

[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.780]
Yeah, yeah, I listened to him.

[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:42.060]
I want to ask you what did you think of?

[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.240]
I think in your comments on when Steve Barnes was traded for Matthew Barnaby.

[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:48.200]
I said it was a good trade for both teams and it will be.

[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:54.120]
It's a pen go in the little more toughness. Barnaby didn't score any points last night, but he was instrumental.

[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.140]
He's good on that team.

[00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.420]
They need somebody tough and the penguins are playing good, even with no money and with a bankrupt team.

[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.760]
And Buffalo needed somebody out of power play.

[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:08.720]
And now they got Juneau also. They're going to that will help them because I'll tell you Buffalo need guys that can stick it in the net.

[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.960]
You know, Hashek's great, but their defense is poor.

[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.400]
So they give up a tremendous number of shots.

[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:15.560]
They held on for dear life against Jersey last night to get that tie.

[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.740]
And if we're for Hashek, they're going out there as they need somebody to stick it in there.

[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.700]
Besides the great Miroslav Shitan, which I told you guys, by the way, months ago,

[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:27.100]
there's the most underpaid talent in the National Hockey League is Miroslav Shitan.

[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.380]
And of course, his name being Satan, all the right wingers are getting nervous about that.

[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:35.540]
I also like to make a request if you can play the Buffalo bill with the plastic surgeon thing.

[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:36.420]
Have a great day, sir.

[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.280]
Okay. Okay. A chance is that no.

[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:38.620]
No.

[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.300]
Okay. We down to a couple of calls and I'm not going to give the number out. You know what it is.

[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:46.520]
Yeah. I'm going to change my whole attitude about this because I got lots and lots of stuff here.

[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.600]
And we are taking a very important survey.

[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:51.620]
By the way, this is a scientific survey. And if your kid comes home from school and says,

[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.420]
Hey, Dad, I decided to join the wrestling team.

[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.420]
Well, I mean, you know, there's no reason not to be proud of that.

[00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:03.200]
Just that that's like a message. That's a way of easing you win to an announcement that'll come later down the road.

[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:06.680]
That's all not always, but very likely.

[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.260]
And you're hurting to hear first on this show.

[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:13.880]
I'm sick and tired of all the pretensions and all the bull crap and all the lies and all the, you know, make believe.

[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.580]
Let's lay it right out there. Okay.

[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.620]
This asshole across me yesterday.

[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:20.400]
Oh, well, most of the professional wrestlers I know are very fine gentlemen.

[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.760]
So most of the fags I know are very fine gentlemen, too like me.

[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:31.420]
Why the hell can't they be gay and be fine gentlemen that goes back to those stereotypical ideas again about hairdressers and paramedics?

[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:33.840]
Here's Margate. Hello.

[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:34.660]
Hello.

[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:35.220]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.200]
Number one, Ed Berliner is a fine young man. I know him for many, many years.

[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.760]
He's an asshole.

[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.680]
Yeah, he's an asshole, but he's a nice guy.

[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:43.160]
No, he's not.

[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:49.020]
Number two, he's a self-absorbed, egotistical, arrogant piece of crap Ed Berliner.

[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.420]
But he never stole a freight train.

[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.740]
Yeah, you don't know Ed Berliner.

[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.840]
I swear I do. I bet $100.

[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.340]
I don't know. Well, you bet me you know Ed Berliner. That's your claim to fame.

[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.740]
I would deny it.

[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.180]
And if I say you know Ed Berliner, I'd say no, I never heard of it.

[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.040]
Ed Berliner.

[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.300]
Oh my god.

[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.780]
Ed Berliner.

[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:06.660]
He calls himself.

[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.100]
No, he is not.

[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:09.360]
Many, many years ago.

[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:11.000]
He does not call himself Berliner.

[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.020]
So you don't know him, sir.

[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.420]
Go ahead. Next, next point.

[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.580]
Number two, did you have it?

[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:16.220]
Hopefully you better than that one.

[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:17.720]
Did you have it?

[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.220]
Did you have it?

[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:18.640]
Did you have it in the day?

[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:20.100]
No.

[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.140]
Oh, it was great. It was Andre the Giant.

[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.640]
Why the hell would I want to watch that crap?

[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:31.560]
Well, anyway, on the day one, I know there's all those sports reporters and sportscasters and sports mavens and sports smelt there.

[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:35.380]
Does anybody know what happened to Scott Melumbi yesterday at the NHL hearing?

[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:38.100]
Don't you read a newspaper, sir?

[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.320]
It's not in there today.

[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:40.500]
It sure is.

[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.120]
Then this comes that no?

[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.200]
It's in both papers.

[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:48.000]
It says that they reviewed it and he didn't high stick the guy that he just got his elbows up and that they apologize.

[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.760]
He shouldn't have been suspended at all for the Anaheim game and he's back in the line up tonight.

[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.080]
Read a newspaper, sir.

[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:54.420]
Have somebody read it to you would be good.

[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.920]
Have somebody that can read, read it to you and it would be excellent, okay?

[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:05.720]
Oh, this chronic Debbie, you know, the chronic colors are annoying, but the chronic faxies I really wonder about, you know.

[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.900]
The chronic faxies are Debbie.

[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.640]
She must be the Debbie on a mobile at-pitch.

[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:11.800]
You know, she must be the same one.

[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:17.600]
Because the faxies on and on and not even with a hockey fax, which I didn't read because I saw the name.

[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.260]
Okay, sweetheart, not interested.

[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.740]
You're chronic. You're a cornice.

[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:26.200]
That's our full question, which is more dangerous, say cornhole or a cornice?

[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.980]
10.56 and well, I know who's dangerous.

[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:31.620]
I'm sports.

[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.900]
Come on, get it. Get the faxies at the beginning there.

[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:34.240]
Come on.

[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:34.820]
What's his name?

[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.200]
Ed Berliner.

[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.320]
Oh, boy.

[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:41.160]
See, I shouldn't have known this guy was a loser calling me to brag that he knew him.

[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.200]
All you kids out there, if anybody says, do you ever hear of Ed Berliner?

[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.940]
Immediately if not sooner, say, no, real loud, yell it.

[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:48.240]
No.

[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.720]
Or they'll start wondering about you guys.

[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:08.480]
Get me a hot, hot towel, because I'm sports.

[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.600]
I'm somewhere.

[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:16.380]
I knew that this would happen sooner or later.

[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:26.100]
I find a person who knew that, and I know I'd like to know.

[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:32.300]
Why all these things happen?

[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:44.260]
I thought wearing foxes were bad, but I thought all them here just nicked into the air.

[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:46.260]
Oh.

[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.640]
Oh.

[00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:58.100]
Oh.

[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.700]
Oh.

[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:01.360]

[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:03.080]
Oh.

[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.020]
Oh.

[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:06.940]

[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:12.780]
Oh.

[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:16.960]
Oh.

[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.000]
I'm watching my Apple Room

[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.820]
For when I get a few sounds out

[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:29.000]
That's when I'll know who I am

[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.780]
That's what's in it's right

[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.720]
I thought well and nothing was bad

[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.820]
What's my ballroom?

[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.100]
11-0-3-5-60

[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:51.560]
Guys put on real tight outfits

[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:54.860]
Real tight pants and the center gets down on his hands and knees

[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:57.340]
And a quarterback comes up right behind him

[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.580]
Puts his hands under his back bone

[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.040]
Right up against his crotch

[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.780]
And says give me your pigskin

[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.120]
You know, what could be more fade than that

[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.080]
These are great. How come we're not using these?

[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:14.860]
Huh?

[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.380]
We are now. We're using them on this show

[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:21.860]
Because they sound like a little bit contemporary like a little upbeat

[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:24.560]
That's what we need some jingles to spice this place up

[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:32.700]
All right. Yeah, there you go

[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.660]
Something that makes it sound a little bit more like F-M-I-C

[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.720]
I was thinking when I was playing those jingles this morning

[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:39.400]
Before we came on the air

[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.560]
You know what? A-M-what a sad thing

[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:45.420]
I realized it sounds like an especially our spots in there because we don't care

[00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.700]
The muffled spots and the ones where they had to pot open when they were dubbing them in there

[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:50.480]
Like the one that D-Fo just had on there

[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.480]
I mean how can we put that stuff on the air?

[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.580]
How can we do it? Sounds so bad

[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.620]
Like it's coming through a strainer

[00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:01.640]
But once upon a time before people discovered F-M and the audio quality of it

[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:05.780]
A-M-I'll give kids out there that don't know from A-M including Deborah over there at Publix

[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:07.180]
By the songgrass

[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.600]
W-E-R-E-C

[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.700]
Yeah, that's where I was those were the golden days the great days

[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:22.220]
W-E-R-E-C

[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:25.960]
W-E-R-E-C

[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:30.420]
Oh boy. Bring back a lot of good memories for back in the days when your radio was worth turning on

[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:32.100]
Which is not too much anymore

[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.320]
This morning I come out of work and you're right about the beach boys by the way

[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:40.380]
There you know as much as I like the beach boys they're just spectacular. They're really are. I was listening to Marvin and Tammy this morning

[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:43.100]
And then when I finished with that I popped into beach boys

[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:48.100]
In my brand new beautiful Corvette and I said hey this is life. In fact speaking of my car by the way

[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.580]
First time in my life something happened I went to Walgreens yesterday

[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:54.420]
I have to get that prescription that Dr. Mark was kind enough to call in

[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:56.920]
And I'm almost off all my medication by the way

[00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:01.460]
I don't know a bare minimum no more client ace my blood sugar this morning with no pills for two days

[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:03.540]
Wait till you hear this 77

[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.460]
77 like W-E-R-E-C

[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:10.720]
That's the music sounds best on W-E-R-E-C

[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:14.740]
Oh see that's my luck that one wouldn't have the 77 on it you bastards how about

[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:15.580]
Come on

[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:16.900]
W-E-R-E-C

[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:21.180]
Assholes come on now one time 77

[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:26.180]
Thank you

[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:34.660]
I got bless you Pam singers 77 how do you like that so anyway I go in I get my friend they were very nice to me in Walgreens this time I mean real even at the

[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:40.140]
That farm with it you know everybody looked at me and like one of my listeners was sitting there which may have helped he said over here

[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:44.260]
About this on the year tomorrow. I said I hope not and I won another episode like I had last time

[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:49.140]
And they looked at me out of the corner of all of their eyes and the boy I was in and out of there in a heartbeat

[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:54.560]
And I walked out to my brand new beautiful car and I looked at it and I thought this is the first time this has ever happened

[00:48:54.560 --> 00:49:00.540]
I've owned two Ferrari's Porsche I've had that awful NSX that I've got the tires that I've got to be changed every week

[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.320]
I've had a lot of nice cars in my life

[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:06.480]
And I walked out there and I looked at that car which I've now had only two days and I said to myself

[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:10.460]
That's my car you know what I'm saying you follow what I'm saying

[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:15.100]
That's mine as if holy crap I'm excited about that

[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:19.160]
It's beautiful car

[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:26.220]
It is just something that hit me like wow I'm actually going to get in and put the my key in the ignition and drive away in it

[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:29.800]
Here's a mobile in Lake Worth. Hello

[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:38.000]
Yeah Neil I'm a native Miami and in a lifetime New Yorkator sports teams and shameless request

[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.180]
I just got done taking my age-year old son for an MRI because his leg tore up pretty good

[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.400]
I think if I could take him to hockey games

[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.060]
No, no, no, no. I will steep stairs there man

[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:49.160]
I want to get him his leg chewed up with that hockey game

[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.740]
5670560 and 0.560 on the AT&T wireless line

[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.800]
And he says get his leg chewed up right

[00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:59.420]
I don't want to be responsible I mean we don't have any malpractice insurance

[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:01.700]
I'd love to have you and your son be able to go see the games tonight

[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:08.120]
But when he feels better when he's all healed up because God forbid you should fall on those stairs or you know anywhere in that arena

[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.940]
And then Wayne's gonna have to pay you know all that insurance money

[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:18.000]
We'll give away between now and new I'll go into you that we got that one pair of good seats to 105 from row 15 excellent seats

[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:24.640]
See this this should tell you the fact that we got some open lines under the fact that this we're going through a real desperate time in this town

[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:27.760]
We're going through a real real hard time

[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:31.780]
Maybe everybody's gone for the holidays maybe they're just all into a coma

[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:35.460]
Maybe Castro's got that woodpecker vibrating and everybody's affecting their minds

[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:40.400]
Maybe they're just glued to the TV or there's Christiana Amin pour right away on CNN what's he doing?

[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:41.580]
He's selling gasoline

[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.680]
Bill all right Christiana Amin pour again on the ground there by telephone

[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:47.840]
Could you tell him by the way or ask him?

[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:51.280]
We could get some level because that's wide open you know

[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.440]
As we mentioned in the secretary general Javier Solana has given the phone line

[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:55.560]
No I'm not serious I mean

[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:57.220]
It's on the list

[00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:01.300]
Oh that's right they're giving it all ahead to bomb them into submission there okay in Kosovo

[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:09.760]
Good that's it let's get with it like I said let's stop being pussy for once in our lives

[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:15.140]
You know let's see if we really mean it if we care about innocent people being slaughtered and butchered and we're going to do something about it

[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:19.980]
And just talk a good game you notice by the way of the money slaughter innocent people in Africa

[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:27.000]
Which they're doing by the thousands in your game to end other places nobody in a work cares about that nobody intervenes nobody says the damn thing

[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:34.280]
But when there's like white folks involved like in Yugoslavia or Kosovo or which is like a little turd about used to be Yugoslavia

[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:40.640]
It's a turd then we got all upset and we start in there we got the B2s and we got the stealth and we got all the stuff going in there

[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.720]
And we're going to blow them back into submission

[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:08.960]
That's the place for me I got the brand new Nike's and I'm ready to die

[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:12.980]
Eight boys and chillos the rest of the guys were going to a station

[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:16.740]
They can't be seen her souls will be taken by a particle being

[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:26.900]
And they should be the only thing the father big you got to sit down to be me you know I think the poison is a type in me is the hell bot comical or me

[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:36.320]
And for liner unforged radio I've been seen W.C.

[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:43.940]
All right yeah well I've said they must have known what an asshole he was when they were recording the jingle all those Pam singers they must have said oh yeah

[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:46.380]
He's a real jackass let's screw up his name

[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:54.080]
Okay let's give those damn pantheid tickets away then we can proceed and do a real show okay then we can really move on with life as we know it or use to know it

[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:59.880]
We're taking a poll today by the way which occupation is the highest percentage of gay so far

[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:04.100]
Paramedics are way ahead in the voting we're doing it on the internet on our website

[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:12.080]

You know guys like you know that go up and down a grease pool all day you really have to wonder about them

[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:26.040]
They slide up and down a grease pool they grease it up and they slide up and down on it and the poll too

[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:30.200]
And paramedics I mean what is that about paramedics?

[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:36.720]
What why is these certain occupations attract and basically when you start see a lot of people a lot of the heterosexuals out there

[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:44.480]
Get very nervous about this because then they start realizing how many of us there are around you know even George gets nervous because it makes you realize that we're like just

[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:49.360]
Do we have any interest in that no five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty out of 18 T line

[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:55.640]
We got plenty of open lines here for today. We're getting a pull number one number two we're giving away tickets to night skin

[00:54:55.640 --> 00:55:00.480]
That's already sold out that they're not even any pantomac and we still got open lines. I'm telling you man we're up again

[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:07.360]
It's following on this I would have scheduled about a three month vacation be having a hell of a good time right now I'd be wrestling with it right now

[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:13.760]
And instead I'm wrestling with a phone here that said there's got to be something I'm telling you believe me when I tell you

[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:22.580]
Even that high price tank over showing you afternoon and he calls no there's something going on since they came in and they added that line that doesn't work

[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:31.300]
I think they're choking it on us is what they're doing you're you know I'm telling you there's something really bizarre and strange going on with this telephone

[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:38.040]
And of course God forbid that we should get the phone people in here to check this damn thing out they don't roll over they come in very strange places

[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:42.420]
They're all over the place look at that God only knows what the hell this system is all about

[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:47.420]
Probably got a new phone system and a god dumpster at crazzies

[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:50.720]
Here's a mobile invoker hello

[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.440]
And how you doing okay sir

[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:59.980]
I just paid tonight for a jumbo sports when I heard you spot on New Jersey my daughter was not sorry I just picked up and take her

[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:04.680]
And I would hope that I could just take her to get her

[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:08.480]
Yeah it's some pucky little kid like that screaming that's the last thing we need to are you out of your mind

[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:14.500]
I mean and by the way you know I keep having these problems with those people that sit in front of me

[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:20.740]
They don't always show up thank God in the landscape they show up and they start passing those little kids around like ornaments

[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:26.520]
And holding them up in the ear in front of us and then they look around my oh we're so sorry I don't want to be I don't want sorry

[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:33.480]
I want to see the game I don't want sorry I want you to put those little kids on your seat or leave them home and get a god damn babysitter

[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:40.640]
In fact I'll tell you what maybe we'll take up a collection in my role and we'll pay for a babysitter so it can keep those little kids at home

[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:46.260]
And stop holding them up like God damn Christmas tree ornaments already or Hanukkah Bush ornaments

[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:53.940]
We go there to see the game not to see the back of your heads and your kids and all that crap that we did it just a half a dozen people

[00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:56.880]
That's all we got it's a little problem there right in front of me okay

[00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:02.760]
I don't know what it takes maybe I got to bring a billboard there maybe I got to put a neon sign up

[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:06.740]
And put in front of the macarena saying all you assholes with your little kids keep them in the seats

[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:13.760]
There may not be many of us who care about the game but I happen to be one I'm not going to go there unless I can see the god damn game

[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:22.840]
Seriously I mean you know you rip these people on the ear they know it they listen they're friends listen people are telling them there's no shame level

[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:30.340]
Their friends come over to hang out in the aisle there while the game is going on you're you're you're craning your head as conspicuously as you can

[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:37.220]
I mean if it happens again I'm just going to say get the hell out of the way you asshole that's all I

[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:41.580]
Mean we're starting to get out of the point where these games really mean something we only got 13 regular season games

[00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:46.980]
That we got a shot at the playoffs if pop out of a decide that his pinky heels up that he's feeling good enough to play

[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:51.580]
And if Mike Wilson decides to show up for practice so we don't get benched on his first night

[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:58.660]
God that's just what we needed is a guy who's compulsively late for everything with a coach like a kindergarten teacher Terry Murray

[00:57:58.660 --> 00:57:59.880]
Just what we needed

[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:06.660]

That's a real city, baby. Not a plastic make-believe joint like this. Now we're talking now. I feel like I accomplished something today

[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.680]
Now that's the hockey music he's talking about. I don't think that's in there anymore, is it?

I'm not with all the hockey stuff. I'm giving them the guy damn hockey tickets. I'm gonna worry about playing him a request

[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.660]
In addition to which this audience still want to hear that song now. We're not gonna play off yet

[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:12.100]
Once Pavell Brewery comes back and we sneak in an edg out Caroline and win the division to get the number three seed in a home advantage

[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:16.460]
And all of a sudden they get hot again like did it three years ago. You believe it? No, well, we can dream can't we

[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.580]
Then we'll start playing all that corny stuff

[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.040]
The last thing the people that this audience want to hear about is hockey

[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.720]
They don't know if they don't understand it

[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:31.900]
It's like the people who work on this radio station. They wouldn't know boom boom Jeffery on from uh Jefferyish warts that they wouldn't know from it from Jeffrey beam

[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:36.900]

[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:44.220]
And by the way, you realize that dog with a bullet through a sign that was like a mafia symbol. He just happened to be there at the moment

[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.280]
Here's a mobile in West Palm, the cello

Health Terry Murray gonna handle with his antics. I don't know

[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:01.580]
I mean even even our good friend Jason Mollie says he's a good guy, but he has she's got problems

[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.640]
He shows up late. He's chronically late

[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:07.200]
Do you think that'd be the last guy in the world at tm one is a guy who's late all the time

[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:12.720]
Well, he could always shack him up with uh with the one that couldn't make the bus

[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:13.780]

[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:18.980]

They put him and Wilson together

[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:41.280]
Maybe the two of them together can make it on time. Yeah, good point

[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:47.120]
Make it there. Okay pal good luck to us. Hey, we're gonna we're gonna take the Rangers and we're gonna go on with the suite

[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:52.500]
We got this home stand. We're gonna go on and then and it's total faith in the path that you got to believe just like the marlin

[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.020]
All right, just like the marlin

[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.860]
Okay, he was doing good to say just like the marlin. Oh, oh

[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.900]
He didn't really mean that did he mean just like the marlin? No

[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:06.000]
He was talking like just like the marlin's a couple of years ago. It was winning. Not like now. Do we care about the marlins now?

[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:11.460]
No, ever again. No, sorry. Got that ballgame. Do our any interest that the marlin's exhibition this game? No, no interest

[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:13.560]
Love these jingles, baby

We're gonna be in a few days

[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:21.720]

[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.140]

There is one of the real class people that ever worked in this market Ken Walden

[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:56.880]
I am proud in fact, I'm embarrassed that I work for Greg Reed

[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:00.460]
But I'm proud that I work on the same station with Ken Walden. How do you like that?

[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.240]
And Ken Walden by the way running run spreading mine all over the building

Hold it hold it hold it one at a time now everybody can't go welcome home CBS

7 we don't want to interrupt his feeding this evening

That's seven o'clock to pregame from the Macarena 7 30 to Panthers beat the crap out of the obnoxious rangers

[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.860]
Ray Whitney's gonna have a not just a hat trick. He's gonna stick four of them in there tonight. That a boy Ray

[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.900]
I'm telling you we're gonna kick their ass you can feel it. You can smell it

[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:06.200]
You can smell the cast of death over John Schmuckler and the entire Ranger organization and Neil Smith and all the rest of those go

[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:09.660]
You can smell it as we stick the nail into coffin of the Rangers

[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.940]
It's not important that we make the playoffs, but that we make sure that they don't that's the most important thing

[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:18.960]
By the way, Carol thanks for your facts. You points out another very good category

[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.640]
Flight attendance male flight attendance. Well, I'd say that's that's close to 100% huh

[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:29.080]
Ever see a straight male flight attendant in your life. No, I mean, I'm sure there must be a couple tokens

[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:34.500]
Then here's a fact from somebody who's very agitated over there a queer channel with Pete Bolger by the way

[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:35.360]
I'll get to that in a minute

[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:39.240]
That's some very cost of things to say not only about him, but about that babbling bro

[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:43.080]
Anybody been listed in her? No, I didn't think so

[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:45.760]
Sure like my CDs you know what in the car

[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.580]
Here's a crawlgables. Hello

[01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:56.420]
Crawlgables hey, Neil sir. How you doing great? Um, I think it's far in a way of pro wrestling

[01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:03.040]
Pro wrestlers are far I mean, that's just the gay sport. There is the fact I thought come there all these people denying it

[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.240]
Well, you know if they went to see the real stuff the extreme championship wrestling

[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:12.360]
They have an open they had an openly gay character for a while right little Stevie Richards who had um

[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:20.040]
Davie Duke shorts little Stevie. Yeah, yeah, little Stevie Richards. He had a little um, you know cut off tank top and he had a little poof metal hair

[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:27.120]
And one time he was trying to pass for straight and one of his boyfriend. I suppose the other wrestler raven

[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:32.040]
pointed out how he he said that you may have a girl now Richard

[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:38.440]
But we all know you're still a fact and he got all these trailer park trash just thousands of them to chant

[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.520]
Steve still a bag

[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.960]
You know, I gotta say you

[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:49.300]
I mean all the hatred just transposed they all knew that he was still a fact

[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:53.340]
Yeah, and thus it was okay for all the little you know trailer park types

[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.080]
To go that route when it comes their time. Beautiful

[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:00.720]
Well, I think that's why we got to make a make this point here that every profession you go into were

[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:05.080]
You know in the back I would be I would be surprised if there's only like 10% the population is straight

[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.800]
I think they got it upside down. Hmm something to think about

[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:15.480]
Well, I don't know I'm great, but this just this conversations making my arm go limp. I gotta tell you okay. Take care

[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:25.760]
It's making something go limp. Yeah, it felt like an arm

[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:30.940]
On your kids out there in the high school wrestling teams. We just say to your coach before the end of this week

[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:34.640]
You know, this was a lot of fun, but I think track and field you know it's a lot safer

[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:35.700]
Huh?

[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:43.000]
Oh, yeah, it's a lot safer. It's better for my image especially since that fags on here outing everybody telling everybody what a fag

[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.720]
Enterprise is guys grappling and groping and mounting each other. I mean, I never really thought about it so much

[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:54.200]
until maybe I'm having like some kind of a spiritual reawakening the last few weeks because

[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:55.200]
now

[01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:00.760]
Even as much against organized religions. I always have been the last week or two

[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:07.280]
I start listening and hearing and reading things and it's a million times more than it ever was before that I realized

[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:13.000]
But you'd have to be out of your mind. You'd have to be certifiable to believe any of these things

[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:20.500]
Like this crap about the devil there are adults there are living and breathing people that believe in

[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:25.000]
Lucifer Satan I'm not talking about nearest loft shittain away the time go for the saber's life

[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.280]
I'm talking about Satan maybe with a tail of a pitchfork

[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.760]
Who maybe people are by the way he could be the anti-Christ that piece of crap

[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.320]
It's just thank you once again people are for lines

[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:42.600]
You ever tell anyone anything that is not a lie or some maneuver which will eventually step somebody in the back

[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:48.140]
No, we know that the joke of a broadcaster brook Daniels will be out soon since her numbers are dropping like a rock

[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:51.240]
Not that it isn't well deserved since he's completely talentless

[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:55.500]
How do you like this? And this is from over on the inside over there too from queer channel

[01:10:56.340 --> 01:11:00.300]
Completely talentless empty headed third-rate Randy Rhodes ripoff

[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:01.500]
pathetic

[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:06.740]
Well, we're stopwater's talk station right even though only seven hours of programming our local god damn Pete

[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:10.300]
You even lie to the audience whatever audience is left. What's next Karen Kay

[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:14.900]
You're the embodiment. I'm embodiment of corporate ass sucking. How do you sleep?

[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:16.980]
Thousands commit suicide every day

[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:19.020]
We won't be sorry if you decide to go along with that trend

[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:26.460]
It says as a matter of fact all purchase a very expensive life insurance policy for your wife to make sure she and her children are properly taken care of once

[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:28.820]
You're dead and buried and John Ford hates you like boys and two

[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.160]
Oh, they're hostile over there a queer channel baby

[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:39.420]
And a fax is right from the inside there it is in the upper left-hand corner clear channel with the full number the whole day the facts number

[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:40.760]
Wow

They hate you like poison PD the tweeting of course you don't care

[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:47.400]
He's got his lips firmly on

[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:51.340]
Rana's butt and on David Ross's butt and whatever buddy can get him on you know

[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:55.660]
Here's a mobile and Delray Beach hello

[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:57.840]

[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:08.500]
Going twice they died in Delray Beach which that's going around up there by the way five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line

[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:10.540]

Hey, I wanted to uh who um and the white mind is from the city council out in Hollywood

[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:24.280]
Is there both in a change the name of a presidential circle for Joseph Oswald?

[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:29.280]
Yeah, I see where his angle berg is very upset about that too. I read that thing today. He's all pissed off about it

[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:32.180]
It's nice to know that our council people out here in Hollywood

[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:35.760]
I would spend the most of the day trying to go ahead renamed this place

[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:40.460]
Why don't they instead just go over to the beach there and put a sign up go home frogs which would be doing everybody a service

[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:46.080]
Huh wouldn't that be better? That's right. That's right. Do something productive for the taxpayers in the Hollywood make the frogs go

[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.380]
I'll get that out of here and put some clothing on before you get out exactly. There's definitely his ride

[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:53.320]
Thank you. God bless you sir. Have a great day and you too

[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:56.980]
Yeah, I read that thing this morning and Morse Angleberg

[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:01.920]
Joe's attorney and longtime companion whatever the hell I mean what

[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:04.060]
Know nothing about what we're talking about

[01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:08.380]
What is it about what you're talking about what about?

[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:09.620]
About renaming presidential circle

[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.780]
What are you some kind of anti-Semite they don't like Joe to manage you just because he

[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:18.540]
smoked three packs of camels a day and was a bad example for all the kids today

[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:24.480]
And died because he was maybe he didn't die because they took his long out maybe died because he was 84 years old

[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:30.960]
That every day that Uncle Milky Circle. Yeah, that's right. He's still alive and got a much bigger shlong tube by the way

[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:35.620]
He gave Maryland a big O. Yeah, Gary. You know, you know, in fact, there was a line in the book

[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.860]
Yeah, who was it that said was in Maryland Monroe? It's it's you must be psychic

[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:46.980]
It's in this book in the Okunanan book by that bag Gary Indiana and it says exactly that

[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:54.260]
Somebody once told Maryland Monroe that built he had the biggest shlong in Hollywood and her comment was who cares who would do him anyway

[01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:01.500]
Seriously that's it's it's I'll find it before the show is over I'll find these that quote you must be psychic god damn it

[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:05.640]

Whatever, huh?

[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:15.680]
All those old Cuban ladies that we fall in hand over fifth to send you money

[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.620]
So I'll be going

[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:19.360]

21 till the noon at 560 WQM of course we left we left the Julio's us to list you know the fact

[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:28.860]
I mean, you know just like George said that's so obvious

[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:30.860]
It's almost like the priest thing

[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:35.060]
I know someone like to do that sandwich or so

[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.320]
Hit mom that skinny chick the skinniest chick I know

[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:45.380]
You're future's bleak that heroin speak you got to lay off the blow

[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:50.800]
Hit mom that skinny chick we want to know what's the deal

[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:56.320]
The clothes and grab when you're in rehab your worst than alley Mcbeale

[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:00.460]
1145 remember Jack Lemons said I had a lousy time and you go slavio

[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:01.700]
remember that

[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:06.000]
That was in a movie mass appeal. Didn't you ever see that movie?

[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.140]
A long time ago

[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:13.280]
Richard was that his name Richard Durning or no Charles Durning he was the priest the older priest

[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:17.300]
And I had a lousy time in Yugoslavia

[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:21.040]
Which is about the only time I'll ever hear about Yugoslavia except now that we're a bummin

[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.600]
The hell out of them over there in coast and is it constable or coast of oh

[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:28.720]
That kind of like changes back and forth forth and back because nobody ever heard of it before anyway

[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:32.900]
I told you that jet bush was an asshole by the way. Told you that here's living proof

[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:37.360]
Restore sodas in the schools bush says he'll drink to that

[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:40.340]
How do you like that?

[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:41.320]
Uh

[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:45.780]
Calahansi governor jet bush agreed things would go better with coke and by the way

[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:48.900]
Anybody see the coaks of stock is going along with the rest of the market in the toilet

[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:55.020]
The agreed things would go better with coke after listening to wait to baton Tuesday over whether the state should drop

[01:15:55.020 --> 01:16:00.860]
Restrictions on soft-ring stales in high schools you parents out there you should be screaming bloody murder on this

[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:07.740]
Okay, of course all you mothers out there probably going to publish and buy all kinds of sodas anyway and poisoning your kids with lots and lots of sugar

[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:18.220]
A Coca-Cola spokesperson and school board officials urged the governor and floater cabinet to be vocal rule that prohibits the sale of beverages from vending machines until at least one hour after the

[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:22.740]
last lunch period nutritionist degree are argued against any change

[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:27.260]
The cabinet would sit at as the state board of education took no median action

[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:32.540]
But boy said he wants to go on record in favor of a repeal. We have too many rules on schools. He said

[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:39.880]
Commission's from vending machines sales would pump millions of dollars into the schools for computers teacher aids learning materials

[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.080]
Athletic equipment and other needs repeal supporters continued

[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:49.400]
The simple fact is we cannot live on taxpayers money alone said panellas county school board attorney John Bowen

[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:55.520]
Florida school boards association lobbyist Wayne Blanton also favored repeal saying local boards that make the final decision

[01:16:56.060 --> 01:17:02.000]
Frank Mullins food service director of the Indian River County school that said vending machines would siphon money from school lunchrooms

[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:10.380]
It's just moving the money from one pocket to another he said it says that the cabinets want schools to sell sodas the food services could do the job instead of the vending machines

[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:20.040]
Mullins and telehassy nutritionist Freddie Kay also argue that selling more soda will harm the health of children because soft drinks have a high sugar content

[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:24.000]
And they displaced milk in the youngsters that's a less bad argument milk will kill them too

[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:30.720]
Kay held up a 12 ounce paper cup in a glass jar containing seven teaspoons of sugar the amount in 12 ounces of soda

[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:36.000]
Are you listening to that 12 ounces of soda seven freaking teaspoons of sugar

[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:43.460]
Girls who drink soda instead of milk are increasing their chances of later getting osteoporosis of bone disease

[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:47.620]
Milk has high levels of calcium which prevents osteoporosis et cetera et cetera

[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:51.900]
How do you like that governor wants coke back in him again to your schools, okay?

[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:56.560]
Maybe he's not talking about Coca-Cola. Maybe this wants coke like that back in the schools, huh

[01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:00.460]
Fony faker. I noticed man was exactly what we knew he was before

[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:02.040]
Piece of crap

[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:09.120]
Here's a lady in pompano. Hello. Hello. Yes, ma'am. Okay. I have the two contributions to your list. Yes

[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:13.260]
Show horse trainers and dog show trainers show and dog

[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:19.720]
Trainers you would be every major horse show in the country you would be really impressed to find a street man

[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:23.640]
Uh-huh, maybe is that why when I see the dog shows they all go prancing around with their dogs on the leash

[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:28.860]
That's exactly why and I don't know about dog shows but with horses. There's kind of a moratorium on ugly men

[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:36.840]

And how are those glory holes get started? I still had no response to the yesterday's question

[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:43.260]

They're not going anywhere. Yeah, I know also the new Jersey Devils have always been a thorn in their side

[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:12.060]
Yeah, they're not going anywhere

[01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:18.920]

Berliner. Oh close enough to match Ed Berliner baby. I love that and by the way these jingles are going over big today

[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.660]

[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:30.880]
So get out of here go back and sit at your desk

[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:39.620]
Here's a tamarack hello. Hey don't know. Okay. Uh, how about the men's shoe salesman at the macy's department stores

[01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:47.020]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha now it's starting to get a little more specific where you kind of like narrowing it down a fashion mall to be exact shoot

[01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:50.840]
Okay, uh, no names of course

[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:52.260]
Wow

[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:56.940]
Well, you know really many come right down to what kind of guys want to smell other guys feet

[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:03.260]
Huh, I mean, I know our well, I mean don't say that. I'm sure that our good friends at Brandys and our people at the new balance

[01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:06.660]
We got a lot of uh balanced people in both of those places, huh

[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:09.460]
We know we need to care who they're dillin. They're great folks

[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:15.320]
But when you come right down it would who the hell wants to have a job sitting around sniffing another guy's feet all day for a living

[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:17.940]
Unless of course you got maybe like a foot fetish

[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:25.740]
Here's a tamarack hello. Yeah, sir. I was wondering did you do not have to catch the fly high-not NBC last night

[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:30.680]
Well, yeah, the thing about the uh major for Miami and his traffic into the Nuffin or I don't know

[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.920]
I saw the very very ass end of that, yeah

[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:38.340]
Well, I the one thing that was just incredible. There's three things first of all if you're a policeman

[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:42.780]
You obviously don't have to obey the traffic laws because the guy said no matter what I did

[01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:48.920]
I shouldn't be getting sick because I'm a police officer right that's right and then the second thing is you should have heard this guy's language

[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:52.460]
He called that policeman give me my license bitch now

[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:56.840]
Let me ask your question. I saw about the last two minutes because I was watching hockey of course

[01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:02.560]
And I flip over that because I do like that show and I I would have sworn that the f-word got on the air

[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:07.340]
Well, it's possible, but how could they believe they couldn't have had anything the guy said about the f-word everything

[01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:12.980]
He said was the f-word. Yeah, and his basic defense was maybe it's a cultural thing, but he says I'm from the city

[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:16.500]
That's the way we talk to everybody. Yeah, so I was wondering

[01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:21.040]
So if the guy said and then you know as much as you don't like the police or whatever the guy said

[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:26.500]
Where would I be if I had been the one calling him a bitch and boy and mother after him this and that right?

[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:30.200]
And then of course the caper of all the guy says

[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:34.820]
Well, I'm just out there doing my job. I'll do anything to stop somebody. No matter how bad the law is

[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:39.080]
It's I'm do it. Mm-hmm. I said well, geez. There he goes first. He's a man

[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:41.720]
You don't have to obey the law through policeman second of all

[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:42.660]
It pulled over

[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:47.520]
You can ask any way you want if all did you know that I did well if you're a black guy

[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:51.600]
I guess you can I'd like to think what would happen if I get out of the car and say give me my license bitch

[01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:55.440]
Give it a shot call us back and let's know. Okay. Give it a try

[01:37:56.500 --> 01:38:02.100]
Okay, I didn't see it five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one when I was busy watching hockey games last night

[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:04.840]
I was watching the Buffalo Jersey a fairly entertaining one one tie

[01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:09.960]
Watching the penguins show like the hell out of the pathetic Chicago black hawks five to two

[01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:12.760]
Pretty entertaining for a little while there

[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:17.160]
Watching a couple of minutes of Dallas and Phoenix to the uh the coyotes

[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:20.800]
Dallas won that game by the way in case you went to bed early. They won a three to two

[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:22.800]
I don't understand them

[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:28.120]
I don't understand they got a lot of old guys on a team and then they got Betty Hogue they brought hit her back

[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:37.800]
I don't the you know my keen and Brian Scroodland and uh geek carbonola a lot of real old old guys, you know on a team

[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:42.660]
I mean they win they keep winning but watching them isn't my idea of excitement

[01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:51.780]
Oh, what do I know here's a lady in North Miami Beach hello. Hello. Yes, man. Yeah. Um, I have two things to say to you

[01:38:51.780 --> 01:39:01.680]
Yes, number one is a man job would be an OB-2 YN and a gay job that I've seen a lot of people in it would be probably a hotel industry guys

[01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:04.500]
I've seen a lot of them I used to work with them

[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:09.540]
So it's pretty much it that's why I wanted to add to your list. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Bye

[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:12.960]
Hotel clerks

[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:14.060]
Huh

[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:17.640]
major d's

[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:19.460]
Right

[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:25.620]
This is such an expansive list we could do this for another six months and not even scrape the surface of it

[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:29.520]
How about proctologists

[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:37.180]
I mean seriously when you come right down to it what kind of a guy really sir

[01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:39.480]
I'm asking to I've asked this before

[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:44.040]
It takes a very special breed and I guess we should be grateful for them

[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:47.920]
Not the ones that are quacks that are like the rubber band man the one who gave me the magnets from my shoes

[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:52.920]
That everybody that goes up there gets the rubber bands whether they need it wanted or not, you know the rubber band man

[01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:57.180]
But what kind of a person wants to stick his finger

[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:00.480]
into other people's rectum and wiggle it around

[01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:09.280]
Huh, I guess probably I'm talking about strangers now you do understand that I'm not talking about somebody you know

[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:10.380]
Huh

[01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:15.820]
Your stick your finger in a stranger's rectum. Yes. Oh come on

[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:19.220]
No, we were always very close now up to which knuckle

[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:23.820]
Here's a mobile in Naples. Hello

[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:26.380]
Mobile in Naples

[01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:32.220]
Okay nice talking to you. They're paying. See how I understand that they're paying for it on their dime

[01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:34.920]
They waited only 11 minutes and then they ran out of money

[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:38.820]
5670560 pound 560 on the mobile one line

[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:42.920]
Seriously, I mean I don't want you to spend the whole rest of the week thinking about it

[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:47.820]
But that's something for us to wonder and it is a very important thing you know going there and have those

[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:51.880]
examinations, you know those colorectal exams somebody's got to do it

[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:54.760]
It's a filthy job, but somebody's got to do it

[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:59.660]
In fact, I know it's I'm having my own lunch and I'm having from a truck by the way

[01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:04.440]
Thank you chuck at the sub center a great salad here, which I'm doing great by the way once you're we're 77

[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:06.100]
I'm kicking ass

[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:11.500]
But you think that I mean, I'm sure that it must have happened over the years

[01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:17.460]
That maybe a proctologist has occasionally put on a rubber glove inserted his digit and then

[01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:18.880]
Do you know what I'm saying

[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:27.220]
Are you conjuring this up in your mind? Huh?

[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:30.380]
I mean I like I said before if there was a god

[01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:32.720]
We wouldn't have to worry about these messy smelly terrible things

[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:37.920]
But unfortunately, there ain't no god. It's just nature doesn't play favorite nature is a wicked

[01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:44.660]
But I've often wondered that if you know the proctologist ever like starts examining it. Oh, man

[01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:49.740]
Here's a Cooper City. Hello. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. I think

[01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:52.320]
Honda's drivers aren't

[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.860]
Yeah, and Terry decorate this

[01:41:54.860 --> 01:41:59.980]
Hardest drivers aren't I knew a couple who were but I don't know okay. No names and Terry decorate this probably are

[01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:07.360]
That's already way up ahead on the list you okay indeed Capita's back in town. That's what I heard what's the essence you on WRLX and Palm Beach

[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:12.220]
Well, how come he's not calling us? I don't know. I just really don't need to that. Okay. Thanks for the good look him up

[01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:15.340]
Yeah, I heard a couple weeks ago Capita was back in town ain't talking to us

[01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:21.080]
I guess probably because we shine. I'm whenever he comes down here. We like Captain Dave. He's a good guy from a distance

[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:23.420]
Do I have any money for him? No, no, he sees all right

[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:29.140]
He kind of bounces around. He's here. He's there. You never did see that spot where he played the Brutus

[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:38.140]
Had the knife behind his back. Look look like an axe-mutter like I always called him and he went out there to a Hollywood and found a part playing an axe-mutter in some spot

[01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:43.540]
Here's Kendall. Hello, hey Neil. Yes, sir great. How about all those little things that are in the

[01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:47.940]
Amusement parks that dress up in the little costumes. Oh amusement park

[01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:54.140]
Excellent, sir. Hey, and how about Chris Wells with all zeros except for penalty minutes. Yeah, he's he's done him at any

[01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:58.900]
He's doing it. Oh, well, he's only here for forgetting though. He's a project. Yeah

[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:05.280]
He's a project. He's playing like this. So be living in the project. He's a reject. Uh-huh. How about this kid Wilson? I came from Buffalo. Mike

[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:11.420]
How is he didn't you read what they said about him? No late for practice late for meetings like the chronically late

[01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:15.480]
So he's not playing now. You think you probably get benched tonight. No, right excellent. Sure

[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:17.840]
People had working amusement parks

But people had worked in amusement parks, huh? We don't want to say like the Disney people because we don't want to get those the Baptist

[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:41.880]

By the way, there's a to show you that the goiim really run this country not as Jews

[01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:51.860]
Newsweek magazine for which by the way I subscribe and I pay money and I really resent I'm gonna write them a letter

[01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:54.720]
Which I never write letters to anybody. I'm gonna write them a letter bitching them out

[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:59.000]
This week's Newsweek magazine 2000 years of Jesus

[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:04.440]
On the cover with a depiction of G and by the way, I since we are talking about this

[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:08.300]
I mean Jesus look up a little bit talk about a bad drag out there. Look at that picture

[01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:10.100]
Get theory of

[01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:15.420]
And it goes in between his fingers there, huh? No, I don't want to look again. Okay

[01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:21.920]
But there are a whole bunch of stupid pull. I mean what kind of people do they pull a bunch of retards for this pull? Uh-huh

[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:25.280]
How important is it that you non-Christian?

[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:32.720]
The how is important that non-Christian's convert to Christianity now evangelical Protestant said very important 72% of them said

[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:37.700]
It's very important to convert the world 25% of other Protestants only 17% of Catholics

[01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:40.640]
How do you like that?

[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:47.740]
Here's now this is the best I want you to stop while you're as soon as you stop thinking about the proctologist and

[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:48.980]
What he's doing?

[01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:50.520]
Think about this

[01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:56.260]
The poll question do you believe that Jesus Christ rose from the dead after dying on the cross

[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:00.400]
Christians 88% of them said yes

[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:04.100]
32% of non-Christian said yes

[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.860]
According to this poll in Newsweek magazine

[01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:15.140]
Is that incredible? So they're both unusual how can you be a Christian and not believe it?

[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:18.820]
Oh there you you think that most Christians believe that crap

[01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:21.580]
Well then how are they Christians that they don't

[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:25.840]
Because they were born in wood they like going and they uh it's like an eternity thing

[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:30.040]
It's a it's a fraternity. It's a social club. It's like going to a panthers game

[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:35.580]
No, seriously. I mean if they said are you a panthers fan? Yes. Are you a hockey fan? No

[01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:41.940]
That means they show up at the games they fraternize they socialize they smooth they little uh

[01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:45.320]
Think of you beers they you know eat a little chow have a good time go home

[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:52.580]
Are they hockey fan? No, did they go to church? Yeah, they smooth they socialize they bring the uh covered plate you know for the

[01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:57.260]
Church picnic and a supper and do they believe it as crap? No, so they're still Christians

[01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:04.140]
But the idea that 32% of non-Christian supposedly believe that Jesus rose from the dead

[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:09.860]
I wouldn't be surprised if goyam on that magazine you know what?

The red marker friend is also caddy

[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:02.860]

Okay 1231 at 560 wq ever so anybody going to back to this news we think for just a second

[01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:59.280]
This is really fascinating because it's got what they claim to be a kind of a mangled history of Christianity through the ages in here

[01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:07.940]
And they have the chronology this 33 AD Jesus is crucified a 33 year 33. What will that be?

[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:09.040]
AD

[01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:16.720]
Yeah, oh, that's right. See I always we don't think of ad domino. We always think of like after death

Bye bye

[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:11.800]
All right

[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:16.200]
It's uh seven, there's more truth to that in fiction. Ever hear them speak them?

[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:21.220]
Uh, those are wonderful Chinese people. I do love the Asian and the folks, but uh, they can't speak

[01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:25.900]
Here are some more homos that says on this list from one of our listeners make-up artists

Uh, Navy submarine personnel

[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:31.540]
Are you kidding me?

[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:34.900]
I'm doing it underwater. How about just the Navy?

[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:37.400]
There's no fact in it. Navy

[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:41.900]
Core singers and then of course Cubans

[01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:44.040]

[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:49.080]
Let's see a broadcasting people at channel seven the cruise play call it the cruiseplex

[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:51.520]

[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:53.280]
bank tellers

[01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:55.460]
Mail telephone operators

[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:59.160]
Most people in the travel industry with exception of our good friend Bob Lincoln

[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:03.180]
And then it goes down here about radio program directors, but I won't read that

[01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:07.320]
We'll say where it's from

[01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:14.100]
Okay, it's a 1245 at 560 wqa m. Don't be picking on uh and the s and woods like that

[01:57:15.180 --> 01:57:16.840]
Here's a mobile in west Palm D. Chilla

[01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:16.840]

[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:19.820]
Mobile in west Palm

[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:21.140]
And then can you hear me?

[01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:22.000]
Yes, sir. I hear you

[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.840]
Okay, uh, I've only been a couple of half hours so I don't know if they had the obvious or not

[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:27.780]
Talk show host

[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:28.520]
Oh, yeah

[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:29.520]
Yeah, okay

[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:34.320]
Now I want to ask you a question. I can remember seeing the hockey games when there were the original

[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:35.360]
16

[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:36.000]
Yeah

[01:57:36.700 --> 01:57:40.100]
Uh, you were back then used to want to get infected, right?

[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:40.420]
Yeah

[01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:44.560]
What was you saying as far as televised uh, back then and now?

[01:57:44.780 --> 01:57:45.160]
What is it?

[01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:46.660]
Talent wise

[01:57:47.220 --> 01:57:48.660]
The game itself

[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:51.100]
You think the games were better back then?

[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:54.880]
Yeah, yes, they were better than and have a great day and get a new phone. You're right. We can't hear you

[01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:00.740]
5605 60 but you know something that was then and this is now remember that movie with the what's his name's kid martin

[01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:03.020]
Sheen's kid what's his name in me. O. S. DeVas

[01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:05.420]
And the one with the Craig Shefford

[01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:06.880]
What

[01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:11.540]
That was a pretty interesting movie uh, that was then and this is now that had its moments

[01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:13.380]
You know, I mean they didn't look too bad

[01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:18.140]
And the media was still he always looked neurotic you know like he was always a little bit off like he was ready to go

[01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:23.100]
Blow off a post office or a banker something. He always looks a little uh right on the edge

[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:27.960]
Like he's not too happy like like maybe he just was walking down a hall behind fat boy

[01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:30.060]
Got that kind of sour look on his face

[01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:35.460]
Yeah, we understand that fat boy is terrorizing men and women around the building wherever he pleases

[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:41.040]
In fact, you know something I think it starts out with a farting and then he did next time he'll go in a tea room

[01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:43.920]
There'll be somebody in both stalls. You know this walk out in the hall, you know

[01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:47.680]
Because you know when you're that big can you imagine the pressure

[01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:53.880]
Can you imagine the enormous amount of pressure that must be building within that creature? Oh god

[01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:57.420]
Here's a mobile in pompano hello

[01:58:57.420 --> 01:59:02.540]

Couple more for your list. Somebody stole my bank teller thing did you do cheerleaders?

Oh, Catholic priest right

[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:20.740]
That's it also I

[01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:28.400]
Good to hear that cheering out better mood today. I was worried that you were gonna be moving up to the New York getting that dairy farm and open in the liquor store

[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:33.060]
Yeah, that's what I'm doing. Well have a nice one. Okay, and have a great life. Obviously in Batavia

[01:59:34.060 --> 01:59:38.280]
Open line indeed five six seven oh five sixteen boy. This is like bio rhythms today

[01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:43.800]
All of a sudden see we finally it's taken us 14 months on his station to figure out our audience over here

[01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:48.560]
Fill out of the same people but a lot of different new some of the sports nerd spilled over the sports nerds

[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:52.820]
All they care about is anal sex and who are the fags? That's what they want to know

[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:57.840]
I think we're just gonna do sex topics every day on this show that with all the other crap in fact

[01:59:57.840 --> 02:00:02.120]
You know Greg read you think across your hell of a lot less and get ten times the ratings

[02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:08.040]
We'd be making millions here. We'd be rolling in money instead of sports talk. How about sex talk?

[02:00:08.220 --> 02:00:17.060]
Huh nobody cares about that boring sports crap a very young Florida Gator team the Florida Gator. Yeah, who cares

[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:20.920]
Man, I love these singles by the way god

[02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:25.160]
Something that actually besides me sounds vibrant and alive on this station

[02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:26.920]
But anyway

[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:29.460]
Here's a candle hello

[02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:38.440]
Candle yes deal. Yes, sir great topics today. Yes, it is just to maybe add one to the list and make a couple of

[02:00:39.020 --> 02:00:40.000]
Observation yes, sir

[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:44.800]
Wrestling coaches wrestling coaches coaches. What's the only corrector?

[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:50.320]
When I was a senior in high school in upstate New York

[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:57.080]
I thought I'd go out for the wrestling team. Yeah, so I went to one practice and wrestling the practice rooms are smaller

[02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:01.740]
It's not like a great big gym or anything. It's got math a little more confined area right exactly

[02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:08.420]
So all the sweat you know and all that kind of right but at the end of the practice and I since I was new to the whole thing

[02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:14.480]
You know it's learning you know the positions and the holes and this and that and the other thing at the end of the practice

[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:16.620]
The coach came out with a little

[02:01:16.620 --> 02:01:20.180]
A practice golf ball a whistle golf ball

[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:26.920]
You know little plastic thing with holes in it. Yeah, and divided up all the wrestling came in the two parts a whistle ball

[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:28.720]
A whistle ball right exactly

[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:34.380]
So one the half the half of the wrestling team got on one end of the wall and the other half went to the other end of the room

[02:01:34.380 --> 02:01:42.680]
The ball was given to one half of the team and they got into a huddle and then they had to hide it someplace

[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:48.220]
Oh, they didn't hide it in their back room. They only placed the hide it is in your jog strap

[02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:55.080]
Yeah, so now the object is for the person with the golf ball to make it to the opposite end of the room with the golf ball

[02:01:55.080 --> 02:02:02.740]
The object of the other team is the group and everything to try to find the golf ball. Yeah, so you can imagine they're looking in there to grab a ball

[02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:07.940]
To grab a ball or two or three. Yeah, no exactly. No, what if they come what if they come out with a a fistful of balls?

[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:10.860]
Exactly, you know like a fistful of yeah, well

[02:02:10.860 --> 02:02:15.060]
Exactly the other thing is the company ask you something that's interesting you mentioned jog strap

[02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:18.620]
Do wrestlers were just a regular jog strap or they were a couple like hockey player?

[02:02:18.620 --> 02:02:20.520]
No, no cup like a baseball or hockey

[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:28.140]
Right, you know the support strap kind of just just a regular jog strap. That's it. Oh my god now I'm more convinced than ever

[02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:31.560]
Exactly right exactly right. Are you kidding me?

[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:35.160]
Just a flimsy little G string that's right. You don't flip the back

[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:41.620]
Oh, you know exactly yeah exactly a tisca to test good. I think I'm feeling you're a basket

[02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:47.120]
protruding balls right exactly the other thing is a couple a few callers ago

[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:54.280]
You had somebody call up about that major from Miami that you stopped up there. It's orange. I think he kind of missed the point

[02:02:54.280 --> 02:03:01.740]
The officer was in dig was mad because he knew what was going on. He knew that he was being profiled as

[02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:07.680]
You know for it improper stop if a guy's driving at night and he fits a certain profile

[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:13.900]
The cops make up anything that they want to pull him over and search the car. Yeah, and he was trying to let him know that

[02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:18.120]
He was he was on to their game. Look. I didn't do anything wrong. What are you doing with me? I'm a police dog

[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:20.800]
We know that up in your land area. They would never pick on no dark folks

[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:21.940]
You know that

[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:26.900]
Especially unless they could okay great. Thank you. So that was great

[02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:30.100]
Here are somebody faxes me. You don't want to miss this tomorrow night the

[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:34.500]
Clock tomorrow night

[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:41.280]
For those of you who like fag events now the amazing part of this is that there are actually our heterosexual people that watch

[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:44.900]
Figure skating is there anybody out there in anybody in the world who can tell me

[02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:48.320]
Huh, what why would you watch that have you ever watched that

[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:54.260]
Sometimes why like that? I'm like go what because I skate

[02:03:55.980 --> 02:04:00.060]
Yeah, so I want to see how you know like could I do that there's a good story

[02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:04.520]
So in other words what you're saying is that if straight people want to find out how something artistic is really done

[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:06.800]
They have to watch fags doing is that what you're saying there you go. Thank you

[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:08.740]
I risk my case

[02:04:09.580 --> 02:04:13.780]
You know whether it's music whether it's the arts whether it's skating whether it's playing hockey oops

[02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:19.280]
Let that slip out whether it's directing programming and a radio oops whatever it might be

[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:26.880]
Whether it's a writing great the novels or non-fiction whether it's a great poetry

[02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:34.840]
Oh, I'm sorry

[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:37.060]
How's he doing?

[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:38.300]
Nothing no more

[02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:46.780]
Yeah, it's just amazing. Thank God for me opening up the eyes and ears and the rears of America to like what it's really all about

Maybe he's talking about that career that used to drive up there in Michigan five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line

[02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:51.200]
We got the Hank Goldberg show from Shulis. They do it to a clock

By the way, and Hank Goldberg showed it. They're going to be listing all of the gay hockey players in the NHL

[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:01.520]
So hell of a long list in fact, I think Denise Potpan is the one that provided Hank with a list

[02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:03.740]
Long long list wow

[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:06.320]
Amazing you'll be shocked when you hear some of the names

[02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:10.240]
And for a manly sport like that you'd be amazed

[02:06:11.260 --> 02:06:12.800]

I just want to listen to Shulis a little while. I'm not sure if you have any of these number one male models

[02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:28.760]
No, you know something nobody mentioned that definitely 99% except for our friend JT in Orlando. We're not sure about you

And I'm a former male model, so I'm on the other session. Okay number two race cars

[02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:51.160]
Yeah, well, why do you think they call them wide receiver? Huh?

[02:06:51.780 --> 02:06:53.680]
Not to mention a couple of quarterbacks to

[02:06:53.680 --> 02:06:59.140]
Jesus look at this I got 450 pages already filled up here. I got enough to write to print a book

[02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:03.560]
Better than that market or book. I'll guarantee you that and certainly more factual

[02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:10.080]
These folks didn't let us down today man the list is on never ending

[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:15.280]
It is just endless out there it goes on and on and on and of course truck drivers

[02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:19.520]
I'm not going to say that they're what you call your ordinary standard gay. They're just lonely

[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:21.040]
You know when to get out there those truck stops

[02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:27.880]
There are some heavy heavy duty stuff that goes down at the truck stops. So I hear and read

[02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:34.440]
I've never spent any time at a truck stop, but I hear some real interesting stories about what goes on there

[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:38.620]
You know, I got another one for the dykes out of this big enough. How about lady truck drivers

[02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:44.300]
Huh, we may be only one exception that we can think of since we did know one lady truck driver although

[02:07:45.100 --> 02:07:45.500]
I

[02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:49.360]
We're not really sure yeah, oh two of them did she also driver truck

[02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:55.700]
The battling brook also was a lady truck driver. I thought you were that's not I always talking about

[02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:01.940]
Randy I thought you were talking about bro. She was a truck driver. No, I don't know. Oh, I was talking about Randy

[02:08:02.540 --> 02:08:03.500]
Well, it's a difference

[02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:07.480]
I don't think this aren't they the same person?

[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:11.300]
Same act I'll tell you that same ratings

[02:08:11.940 --> 02:08:11.960]
hahaha

[02:08:13.780 --> 02:08:16.820]
Lady truck drivers, but why do you think they call those trucks diesel trucks?

[02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:19.700]
And why do you think they call them diesel dykes?

[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:24.840]
Wonder if an bishop ever drove a truck, huh? I used to make jokes all that. That's why she hated me like poison

[02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:29.060]
It was to always make those comments about and you know driving her diesel rig down the Hershey highway

[02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:31.560]
How much is sandy was porked off about that

[02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:35.700]
1256 at 560 wq.a.m

[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:41.280]
Let me tell you mama. Oh, in fact, I mentioned Jeff Cohen's got a ear glued to this because if there's anything that has to do with the

[02:08:41.300 --> 02:08:46.840]
sex with perversion with no matter what kind of it is he wants to hear about it. He wants to sniff and he wants to know it

[02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:49.140]
So why don't you tell our

[02:08:50.260 --> 02:08:51.720]
Father in law

[02:08:52.420 --> 02:08:59.400]
Would you get off my bus if your daughter so perfect watching Mary such a putt

[02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:01.900]
Father in law

[02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:04.220]
You think you better than me

[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:08.820]
But I don't eat in cafeteria and I have cable TV

[02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:10.980]
Oh

[02:09:17.660 --> 02:09:27.000]
You

[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:27.640]
.....

[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:29.160]
allá

[02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:33.560]
i

[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:44.080]
Father in law, fill the eye of the creep,

[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:49.120]
When I ain't clippin' coupons every day of the week,

[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:54.220]
I don't let them like you, don't go to the dog track,

[02:09:54.980 --> 02:09:59.040]
And I don't drink out coffee, when I eat a big bag.

[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:04.120]
You're a donut in my west, I will not destroy her.

[02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:07.100]
You're just gonna have to get over it,

[02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:12.180]
You need to bury us all like you're...

[02:10:12.180 --> 02:10:12.940]
Oh, right.

[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:13.720]
Oh, the best.

[02:10:14.380 --> 02:10:17.300]
102 at 560 WQ, my group are our big ones at 2 hour.

[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:19.780]
We're outing the entire world here today,

[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:22.080]
And quite frankly, I think we got a real good head start,

[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:23.180]
If I can use that expression.

[02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:24.160]
What a bunch of crap.

[02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:24.680]

[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:27.780]
So anyway, it's kind of like I have something really...

[02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:30.700]
You're right on the tip of my tongue, something incredibly important to pass you out.

[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:31.580]
Oh yeah, that's right, Marines.

[02:10:32.300 --> 02:10:34.340]
Only a few Marines are, you know.

[02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:36.100]
And you can always tell by the ones that say,

[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:38.580]
Semper 5, huh?

[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:41.600]
If they say, Semper 5, that's usually a pretty good tip off.

[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:42.860]
It's just that drill team.

[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:44.420]
Yeah, they're drilling it.

[02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:48.080]
You know, I love those old military guys,

[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:49.720]
especially the Navy guys that always,

[02:10:49.860 --> 02:10:51.620]
Oh no, you make these things up,

[02:10:51.780 --> 02:10:54.480]
You're just like the guy that was telling me the other day about wrestling

[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:57.860]
about how I'm fantasizing because I'm a faggot farmer.

[02:10:58.120 --> 02:10:59.540]
I got news for you, let me say it again.

[02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:02.540]
Both newspapers today on the Back Page of the Sports section,

[02:11:02.540 --> 02:11:04.440]
the all-broward county wrestling team.

[02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:07.460]
Okay, these are all high school kids, 17, 18 years old.

[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:08.840]
Okay, and if any of them looked really good,

[02:11:09.140 --> 02:11:10.640]
I would admit to you, hey, they look pretty good.

[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:11.920]
You know, I would mind mounting them.

[02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:13.580]
Even though that would be in the...

[02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:15.240]
And I wouldn't use no names, for obvious reasons.

[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:16.920]
But I wouldn't touch any of them.

[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:21.380]
I've never seen a wrestler, a high school, a college,

[02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:25.480]
a professional wrestler that tiddly-ded me if I can say that even slightly.

[02:11:26.060 --> 02:11:29.760]
So it's not the fact that I'm fantasizing or I'm conjuring these things.

[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:34.800]
I mean, it's obvious you have to be totally just blocked it out in your head not to see it.

[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:35.160]
You know?

[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:38.500]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:39.040]
Hello.

[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:40.360]
Hello.

[02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:40.860]
Yes, sir.

[02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:41.940]
This is a Julio.

[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:43.000]
You know, I'm a biker.

[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:43.920]
Bikers?

[02:11:44.380 --> 02:11:45.460]
And the surveyors.

[02:11:46.020 --> 02:11:46.380]
Yeah.

[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:49.180]
We got one John Harris, he's one of those.

[02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:52.320]
You got one?

[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:54.940]
Yeah, like the movie, like the movie I put you with,

[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:55.780]
I'll put you in a cruising.

[02:11:56.220 --> 02:11:56.440]
Yeah.

[02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:58.380]
Yeah, there's a bunch of homeless there.

[02:11:58.380 --> 02:11:58.840]
Okay.

[02:12:00.220 --> 02:12:00.580]
Yeah.

[02:12:01.460 --> 02:12:04.400]
That was your favorite cruising, a real homophobic movie if there ever wasn't.

[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:07.200]
But that's the kind of image a lot of you guys like to think it's all about.

[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:09.020]
And yeah, we don't care.

[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:12.860]
Here's a, here's a pay phone in Miami.

[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:13.180]
Hello.

[02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:16.200]
Pay phone in Miami.

[02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:16.580]
Hello.

[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:20.060]
Pay phone in Miami.

[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:22.500]
Somebody spent money to make this call and they're gone.

[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:24.080]
Oh my God.

[02:12:24.180 --> 02:12:25.380]
Probably is they ran out of quarters.

[02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:26.640]
And it wasn't no pay phone either.

[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:31.300]
560, 560, 560, 560, 180, D wireless line.

[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:33.520]
That's a bitch ain't it when those guys run out of quarters?

[02:12:34.020 --> 02:12:34.620]
Oh no.

[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:35.840]
Not now.

[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:38.520]
Here's coconut cream.

[02:12:38.700 --> 02:12:38.840]
Killa.

[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:39.720]
Hello Neil.

[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:40.180]
Yes sir.

[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:41.860]
All right, I got a couple for you.

[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:42.900]
How about hairdressers?

[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:43.580]
Yeah.

[02:12:44.260 --> 02:12:44.700]
Waiters.

[02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:46.140]
Waiters we got.

[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:47.620]
You got a weatherman.

[02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:49.380]
TV weatherman.

[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:49.840]
Excellent.

[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:52.440]
I mean, other than Bob Weaver and Bob Soaper, I had done.

[02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:53.380]
No.

[02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:54.220]
Other than them.

[02:12:54.380 --> 02:12:55.000]
Why North Cross.

[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:55.560]
Right.

[02:12:56.240 --> 02:12:56.520]
Okay.

[02:12:56.960 --> 02:12:58.300]
I went down to Nick.

[02:12:58.500 --> 02:13:01.020]
Other than Brian North Cross and that's the Kamal guy.

[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:01.500]
I don't feel.

[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:02.480]
I don't feel.

[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:03.420]
Stormfields.

[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:03.840]
Yeah.

[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:05.120]
Peppy feels.

[02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:06.980]
I went down to Nick's in Miami.

[02:13:07.380 --> 02:13:07.560]
Yes.

[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:09.820]
I've worked with a Mentos.

[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.600]
I don't know what was going to take me to choke one of them down.

[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:14.580]
It all depends on where you're sticking it, I guess.

[02:13:15.380 --> 02:13:15.700]
Brackdom.

[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:19.380]
560, 705, 60, 05, 60.

[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:20.780]
Well, we know where his heart is at.

[02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:21.980]
Heart, I said.

[02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:22.080]
I said I said.

[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:23.820]
You are the line.

[02:13:29.980 --> 02:13:35.460]
We are beginning between Archie Ireland, $ do not compare to

[02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:37.380]
wesfields, born as the ball, toriad.

[02:13:37.380 --> 02:13:38.560]
Some of them are witnesses that are against us.

[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:38.560]

[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:41.160]
iction as opposed to volcanoes.

[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:41.280]
They are not near that.

[02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:42.080]
�로, some of them so far.

[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:43.980]
On my shoulder.

[02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:51.220]
When I was teaching I realized that this haciendo was

[02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:51.220]

[02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:51.220]

[02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:51.220]

[02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:51.960]
When I was about to be honest with him, I never knew there was

[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:55.120]
I slowed off the toilet seat. What was the name of that joint? Up there on

[02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:00.540]
441. Don't you remember that story that I told you? I can't know the tango restaurant.

[02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:05.060]
I was there with Bill Calderon his wife and I was doing the Green Apple Quick Step because there

[02:14:05.060 --> 02:14:09.460]
was somebody in there and I finally just barely got in there and I sat down on the seat and it

[02:14:09.460 --> 02:14:15.900]
slid right off the seat, slid right on the floor with me on it. And through some miracle of the

[02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:19.040]
Lord, I was there, you know, I didn't have the usual reflex like the minute you sit down,

[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:22.220]
you know, you had that release because you're mind is saying it. In fact, sometimes as you

[02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:24.960]
getting closer to it, you're mind is saying it and you said, no, no, not yet.

[02:14:26.540 --> 02:14:32.640]
No, this wasn't some other restaurant and I just, sorry, I mean, that was it. There was no more

[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:37.040]
waiting and the men's room was a small place and the men's room was a cappado. There was somebody

[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:43.160]
sitting on it and so what could I do? I went in the ladies room. I took a chance and there was

[02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:48.640]
nobody in there and I hit in the ladies room. Huh? There you go. Be headlines in the hero tomorrow.

[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:53.820]
Near Rogers out of the closet dumps in ladies room. Well, you don't count. And there was no

[02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:58.380]
graffiti in there, by the way. I did take notice at that time, but that's that's all my experience.

[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:03.380]
I'm sure I haven't checked them all out yet. Here's a wrong line. Here's plantation. Hello. Hey,

[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:08.620]
how you doing? Great. You left out coaches. Lot of coaches or something's wrong with them. Swimming

[02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:49.100]
Chris and Becky, right? You see the ones that come over here real estate it. Now this is an

[02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:55.280]
off-line open to me. I never heard that before. Oh, man. I get scared when they drive up over here.

[02:15:56.080 --> 02:16:01.580]
And off the for the guy who said all Honda drivers come to jump into his John Deere tractor and I

[02:16:01.580 --> 02:16:10.560]
race them any day. Okay. All right. So yeah. He said, come to jump into his John. Come on, Deere.

[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:15.300]
I'm telling you, is another one of those team room cruises from Westland. You could recognize the

[02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:20.780]
voice. Eight minutes after one at five, six, eight, we introduced this town to glory halls to the

[02:16:20.780 --> 02:16:25.120]
real graffiti and ladies rooms to all these bag professions. It's about time we started having

[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:30.580]
some honest talk on a radio instead of this crap about a very young Florida Gator team. Oh,

[02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:35.600]
God. And by the way, I think I'm going to stop at the shock box today. See if I can't find me

[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:40.260]
the Michigan State Fight Song. Getting ready for getting beat by Duke this weekend.

[02:16:40.260 --> 02:16:44.600]
You know, probably get our ask it. But who cares? I'll go a little glory. Hold for MSU.

[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:49.940]
Well, I'd sure like to go back and see now that I know what I know now. Now it's time to go back to

[02:16:49.940 --> 02:16:56.920]
college. Oh, yeah. Huh? Now that I know that I've lived all of these long years and accumulated

[02:16:56.920 --> 02:17:02.000]
this massive learning and all this perversion, now is the time to go back and check things out at MSU.

[02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:07.380]
I can just imagine. I can know if I can't even begin to imagine the kind of crap that's going on

[02:17:07.380 --> 02:17:09.540]
over there. But I'd sure like to try.

[02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:41.140]
Oh, yeah.

[02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:43.180]
Oh, yeah.

[02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:45.880]
Oh, yeah.

[02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:45.880]

[02:17:46.100 --> 02:17:46.320]
Oh, yeah.

[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:46.660]
Oh, yeah.

[02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:50.200]
Oh, yeah.

[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:50.240]

[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:55.020]
Oh, yeah.

[02:17:55.020 --> 02:17:55.920]
Oh, yeah.

[02:17:57.400 --> 02:17:58.060]
Oh, yeah.

[02:17:58.480 --> 02:17:59.000]
Oh, yeah.

[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:02.860]
Oh, yeah.

[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:07.360]
Oh, yeah.

[02:18:08.900 --> 02:18:10.100]
Oh, yeah.

[02:18:10.100 --> 02:18:10.900]
Oh, yeah.

[02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:13.580]
Oh, yeah.

[02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:15.360]
Oh, yeah.

[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:17.180]
Oh, yeah.

[02:18:17.980 --> 02:18:18.220]
Oh, yeah.

[02:18:18.220 --> 02:18:19.100]
Oh, yeah.

[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:19.940]
Oh, yeah.

[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:21.260]
Oh, yeah.

[02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:26.420]
That's it.

[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:29.000]
115 is 5-2-2-2.

[02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:33.680]
Just like my mother is that her repeat old stories over it over again. Forget about Steve Nichol.

[02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:35.600]
Okay, he's small potatoes. He was straight though.

[02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:40.320]
So anyway, hey, I was just reminiscing, by the way, speaking of wrestling and the fact that virtually

[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:44.440]
everybody anonymously and unanimously agrees today that the wrestling is a fact pursuit.

[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:47.540]
And then maybe if you straight people in it because they're confused and haven't caught on yet,

[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:48.560]
that they're being mounted.

[02:18:49.260 --> 02:18:53.240]
But when I was in Bellow's Night or Summer camp at fourth late New York in the Adirondex

[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:58.420]
and upstate New York when I was 16 years old many years ago, there was a kid named Gary Schwartz.

[02:18:58.540 --> 02:19:02.780]
This just came back. Isn't it funny how your memory comes flushing back and rushing back?

[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:05.740]
And you can get like a little stiff in the loin thinking about it.

[02:19:06.260 --> 02:19:08.700]
There was a real, real good looking kid named Gary Schwartz.

[02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:10.500]
We were both like 16 years old at the time.

[02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:13.960]
And he and I, for some reason, not that we didn't like each other,

[02:19:14.060 --> 02:19:17.020]
but you can develop these kind of rivalries and camp, you know, friendships,

[02:19:17.260 --> 02:19:21.340]
rivalries. And we always want to wrestling on the floor together.

[02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:25.560]
Huh? What did I like that?

[02:19:25.940 --> 02:19:27.340]
And did I grab his parts?

[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:28.520]
Oh, yeah.

[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:29.920]
Well, that's a good way to do it.

[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:32.920]
Especially when a guy's got no job step just, you know, in your clothing.

[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:37.400]
That's always a good way to kind of like weaken him for the kill, you know, to get him down

[02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:39.120]
on the ground just in the right position.

[02:19:40.600 --> 02:19:42.100]
Gary Schwartz, how you doing, Gary?

[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:44.260]
Sure hope he got off his knees.

[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:46.120]
Here's the Opalaka. Hello.

[02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:47.000]
Hey, Neil.

[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:47.880]
Yes, sir. How are you?

[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:48.240]
Great.

[02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:49.680]
Great. I got three at your list.

[02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:50.100]
You don't know.

[02:19:50.100 --> 02:19:50.880]
Oh my god.

[02:19:51.140 --> 02:19:53.180]
Number one, male social workers.

[02:19:54.420 --> 02:19:55.480]
Male social workers?

[02:19:55.620 --> 02:19:55.840]
Yes.

[02:19:56.140 --> 02:19:56.260]
Yeah.

[02:19:56.600 --> 02:19:57.320]
I know one of those.

[02:19:57.320 --> 02:19:57.700]
No.

[02:19:58.800 --> 02:19:59.180]
Yeah.

[02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:00.620]
Number two.

[02:20:00.780 --> 02:20:01.860]
Yeah. City mayors.

[02:20:02.420 --> 02:20:03.180]
City mayors?

[02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:03.680]
Uh-huh.

[02:20:04.460 --> 02:20:06.340]
And number three, end of the council.

[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:07.880]
Okay. Love you.

[02:20:08.040 --> 02:20:08.280]
Thank you.

[02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:11.520]
Okay, we have an open line on the out of town line.

[02:20:11.620 --> 02:20:12.000]
Wherever that is.

[02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:14.680]
56705, 60, 05, 560 on the AT.

[02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:15.780]
This is an endless list.

[02:20:15.940 --> 02:20:17.720]
It goes on and on and on.

[02:20:17.820 --> 02:20:18.860]
Is there an end in sight?

[02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:19.120]
No.

[02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:21.440]
Just goes on forever.

[02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:23.640]
Here's Naples. Hello.

[02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:24.560]
Neil.

[02:20:24.780 --> 02:20:25.080]
Yes, sir.

[02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:26.480]
I have two for you.

[02:20:27.420 --> 02:20:27.760]
Okay.

[02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:30.020]
And I felt quarterbacks in centers.

[02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:31.500]
Isn't that obvious?

[02:20:31.780 --> 02:20:31.980]
Yeah.

[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:35.360]
And the other things, the response to your graffiti thing?

[02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:35.740]
Yes.

[02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:37.180]
Like yourself.

[02:20:37.420 --> 02:20:39.380]
I've been in there a couple of times because I couldn't wait.

[02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:39.660]
Right.

[02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:42.020]
And not only is there no graffiti,

[02:20:42.040 --> 02:20:44.140]
but there are about a hundred times cleaner

[02:20:44.140 --> 02:20:44.920]
than the men's rooms.

[02:20:45.100 --> 02:20:45.900]
Yeah. Is that something?

[02:20:46.180 --> 02:20:46.580]
I love it.

[02:20:46.820 --> 02:20:47.040]
Okay.

[02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:47.480]
Bye.

[02:20:48.040 --> 02:20:49.200]
Yeah. See men are slabs.

[02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:50.100]
We admit it. We're slabs.

[02:20:50.160 --> 02:20:52.360]
We go in here and we make a mess and throw stuff on the floor.

[02:20:52.440 --> 02:20:54.380]
And you know, that's the manly thing to do.

[02:20:54.640 --> 02:20:56.260]
Even us bags, we tend to be slabs.

[02:20:56.900 --> 02:20:59.200]
But women, of course, even women who are slabs,

[02:20:59.360 --> 02:21:00.860]
they, in certain areas like when you go to the,

[02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:02.360]
they don't call it the ladies room.

[02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:03.600]
It's the powder room, you know.

[02:21:03.820 --> 02:21:05.460]
And they go in there and they'll like kind of socialize.

[02:21:06.060 --> 02:21:07.680]
In fact, if you've ever been in a ladies room

[02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:08.980]
that is a real powder room,

[02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:10.600]
you notice it is a powder room.

[02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:11.440]
There's an area where they,

[02:21:11.580 --> 02:21:13.300]
they can do all kinds of stuff in there.

[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:14.980]
You know, powder their face, put on a makeup,

[02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:16.040]
and et cetera.

[02:21:16.260 --> 02:21:16.980]
They have a lounge.

[02:21:17.260 --> 02:21:17.840]
Yeah, we're exactly.

[02:21:18.140 --> 02:21:19.380]
It's not just the place to do a,

[02:21:19.640 --> 02:21:21.040]
it's one of those disgusting things

[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:21.860]
that nature requires.

[02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:23.540]
It's a place to go in there and smooth

[02:21:23.540 --> 02:21:25.740]
and socialize and freshen up and, uh,

[02:21:25.740 --> 02:21:26.820]
whatever you're here, exactly.

[02:21:27.780 --> 02:21:28.500]
Compare sizes.

[02:21:29.220 --> 02:21:30.860]
Like what's your name was doing the San

[02:21:30.860 --> 02:21:33.780]
Santino's wife and the Godfather there at the wedding, remember that?

[02:21:34.100 --> 02:21:35.660]
And by the way, it wasn't, uh, what's your name?

[02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:37.840]
It wasn't the, who did the guy say it was the other day?

[02:21:38.700 --> 02:21:40.380]
Playing the Santino's wife in there.

[02:21:40.460 --> 02:21:41.400]
It wasn't Rita Moreno.

[02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:41.700]
Sorry.

[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:42.860]
You lose.

[02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:45.740]
How do I achieve time for that name?

[02:21:45.880 --> 02:21:48.300]
Where she was always doing $10,000 pyramid with Dick Clark.

[02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:50.780]
And Bill Cullen with the wooden leg.

[02:21:51.980 --> 02:21:53.160]
But you don't like Rita Moreno?

[02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:55.520]
You know, she was great in fame.

[02:21:55.960 --> 02:21:57.080]
Remember that scene in fame?

[02:21:57.980 --> 02:21:58.140]
Wicked.

[02:21:58.400 --> 02:21:59.500]
She says, what do you call that?

[02:21:59.820 --> 02:22:00.000]
Wicked.

[02:22:02.180 --> 02:22:03.000]
Hey, Lee Roy.

[02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:06.000]
Who wants to go to an F&D school anyway, Lee Roy?

[02:22:07.900 --> 02:22:09.100]
Here's a must-great movie.

[02:22:09.180 --> 02:22:10.000]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:22:10.200 --> 02:22:10.340]
Hello.

[02:22:10.840 --> 02:22:11.120]
Hey, Neil.

[02:22:11.340 --> 02:22:11.620]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:12.040 --> 02:22:15.100]
Hey, what about office managers and receptionists?

[02:22:15.740 --> 02:22:17.260]
And also, I have nothing that,

[02:22:17.780 --> 02:22:19.440]
what are the homeless special cars?

[02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:22.800]
What kinds of cars drive like the little pickouts and the meadas

[02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:23.800]
and the things like that?

[02:22:23.860 --> 02:22:24.880]
I didn't know there was such a thing.

[02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:26.280]
I just keep looking for the rainbow flag.

[02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:27.280]
Right.

[02:22:27.460 --> 02:22:28.280]
Is there such a thing?

[02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:28.920]
Yes.

[02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:29.760]
Meada?

[02:22:29.940 --> 02:22:31.420]
Well, Alex, Benet drove a meada.

[02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:33.960]
Well, it's a good point.

[02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:36.100]
Yeah, he was from Frisco, yeah.

[02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:37.200]
I have one comment.

[02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:41.300]
I'm a heterosexual and I think almost

[02:22:41.300 --> 02:22:44.640]
sexual are good people and most of them make good neighbors.

[02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:47.020]
As long as they don't try to make a pass with me or whatever,

[02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:51.400]
well, okay, because I truly believe that they're born that way

[02:22:51.400 --> 02:22:52.960]
and they can't control it.

[02:22:53.160 --> 02:22:53.660]
Yes, we are.

[02:22:54.040 --> 02:22:54.400]
Okay.

[02:22:54.600 --> 02:22:54.780]
Okay.

[02:22:55.580 --> 02:22:56.880]
So yeah, plus you're not my type.

[02:22:57.500 --> 02:22:58.540]
I mean, it's obvious.

[02:22:58.720 --> 02:23:00.800]
I mean, anybody that would argue that anymore that's, you know,

[02:23:00.940 --> 02:23:03.420]
not genetic is probably a kind of Jerry Fowell.

[02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:05.300]
I'll probably do a Jerry Fowell or pictures of him

[02:23:05.980 --> 02:23:08.160]
or maybe just jerking off the pictures of Jerry Fowell.

[02:23:08.280 --> 02:23:10.280]
Well, we have an open line 5 6 7 0 5 60,

[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:12.960]
pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:16.880]
By the way, who sent me that the Pornow video that I got in the mail yesterday?

[02:23:17.180 --> 02:23:19.540]
It says on the, uh, did you, uh, you, I opened it in here?

[02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:22.020]
On the tape itself, it says, um,

[02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:23.560]
adventures in Italy.

[02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:26.920]
And it made me some adventures in Italy, but, uh,

[02:23:26.980 --> 02:23:29.040]
quite frankly, I never had no adventures in Italy like that.

[02:23:29.140 --> 02:23:29.460]
Not yet.

[02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:30.520]
Anyway, wow.

[02:23:31.140 --> 02:23:33.560]
Man, squirt, squirt, put that Peter North in his place.

[02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:35.660]
Here's, uh, Kendall.

[02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:35.980]
Hello.

[02:23:36.580 --> 02:23:37.720]
You know, I got one for you.

[02:23:37.820 --> 02:23:38.220]
Yes, sir.

[02:23:38.340 --> 02:23:39.160]
Well, I was in high school.

[02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:40.120]
I was, I wrestled.

[02:23:40.740 --> 02:23:42.940]
And definitely the mat boy's got to be one.

[02:23:43.460 --> 02:23:44.200]
The mat boy?

[02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:48.560]
Yeah, but his job was to clean the mat after we all got done wrestling.

[02:23:49.420 --> 02:23:50.580]
I can't do not.

[02:23:50.580 --> 02:23:50.900]
Yeah.

[02:23:51.340 --> 02:23:53.360]
Now, did he do that with like a towel or his tongue?

[02:23:53.660 --> 02:23:55.240]
He did it with a towel in a tongue.

[02:23:55.380 --> 02:23:55.660]
Uh-huh.

[02:23:55.940 --> 02:23:56.220]
Okay.

[02:23:56.760 --> 02:23:57.220]
Thank you.

[02:23:57.380 --> 02:23:57.380]

[02:23:57.600 --> 02:23:59.740]
Yeah, hey, can I get a long time old time request?

[02:24:00.020 --> 02:24:00.260]
Maybe.

[02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:01.560]
Want some baguette?

[02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:02.400]
Okay.

[02:24:03.060 --> 02:24:03.540]
Thank you.

[02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:03.940]
Yeah.

[02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:06.180]
Yo, he was talking about the mat boy.

[02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:07.700]
I think I thought he was going to talk about the, uh,

[02:24:07.820 --> 02:24:10.080]
my boy that goes into those peat with places, you know?

[02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:11.780]
I just like to have that kind of a job.

[02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:16.600]
Okay, let's lock it too far.

[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:17.120]
Field, okay?

[02:24:17.140 --> 02:24:18.700]
We'll see that we can kill four hours of that tomorrow.

[02:24:18.700 --> 02:24:20.620]
Or I hate two hours and 50 minutes tomorrow.

[02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:23.640]
Just before we're finally making a comeback here, we got,

[02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:24.500]
you know what I'm saying?

[02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:26.800]
We had those two days that threw us off completely.

[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:29.040]
Last Thursday and Friday with that Marlon baseball crept.

[02:24:29.260 --> 02:24:30.760]
We finally took a three days today.

[02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:31.740]
We're making a comeback.

[02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:32.800]
Everybody's doing great.

[02:24:32.980 --> 02:24:35.240]
We got a list longer than my armpit.

[02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:39.260]
And tomorrow we got Marlon's in the Cardinals at 1250 again.

[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:40.260]
Oh man.

[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:43.180]
Boy, talk about just taking all the steam out of your sales.

[02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:45.560]
Here's a cutleridge.

[02:24:45.700 --> 02:24:45.800]
Hello?

[02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:48.200]
Cutleridge.

[02:24:49.700 --> 02:24:50.500]
Going once.

[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:51.760]
Okay, long gone.

[02:24:51.860 --> 02:24:52.640]
I probably hit the T-room.

[02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:54.520]
Here's a Voka.

[02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:55.000]
Hello?

[02:24:55.460 --> 02:24:56.080]
I know.

[02:24:56.220 --> 02:24:56.540]
Yes, sir.

[02:24:57.740 --> 02:25:01.240]
Before the news break, you were talking about the news break.

[02:25:01.420 --> 02:25:03.580]
I want to talk about a couple of minutes.

[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:04.560]
Commercial break, yeah.

[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:05.300]
We don't have any news.

[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:06.200]
We just have spots.

[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:07.460]
Lots and lots of spots.

[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:11.080]
We were talking about the flammers.

[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:14.360]
The flammers, when you look at the sink, the holes in the sink,

[02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:17.260]
that the faucet comes through, the core cock holes.

[02:25:17.260 --> 02:25:17.980]
Yeah.

[02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:19.780]
And if you want to blank one of them out,

[02:25:19.780 --> 02:25:22.160]
you want to the shop and yes, for a cock hole cover.

[02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:24.080]
Just thought to pay for that.

[02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:24.840]
Okay, thank you.

[02:25:25.420 --> 02:25:26.280]
Okay, we believe you.

[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:27.260]
Do we believe him?

[02:25:28.020 --> 02:25:28.200]
Yes!

[02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:29.860]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:30.840]
By the way, the...

[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:34.020]
This briefing which appears to about the about to wrap up.

[02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:34.520]
Oh, thank God.

[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:36.360]
This guy's been briefing us for hours now.

[02:25:36.460 --> 02:25:36.980]
That's a...

[02:25:36.980 --> 02:25:38.560]
James Ruben from the State Department.

[02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:38.800]
From the State Department.

[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:40.680]
We're calling by the highest court in Britain

[02:25:41.780 --> 02:25:42.500]
upholding charges.

[02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:44.120]
And I'm going to read here now from you.

[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:44.560]
So, if I could...

[02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:46.020]
Why don't I talk about the bottom of the question?

[02:25:46.020 --> 02:25:46.760]
You want me to go.

[02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:49.140]
Britain's highest court today upheld

[02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:53.440]
former Chilean general Agusto Pinot Shae's arrest on charges of...

[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:54.220]
Oh, good.

[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:55.640]
In the United Violations.

[02:25:56.060 --> 02:25:57.420]
However, it's one of the same time

[02:25:57.420 --> 02:25:59.520]
throughout many of the charges.

[02:25:59.740 --> 02:26:02.760]
27 of the 30 charges in a Spanish warrant.

[02:26:03.060 --> 02:26:05.300]
Again, that former Chilean dictator.

[02:26:05.400 --> 02:26:07.480]
From the time being, for the time being,

[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:12.080]
it means that Mr. Pinot Shae will remain in Britain.

[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:14.180]
Let's go to the Pentagon now.

[02:26:14.180 --> 02:26:16.600]
Something that's good enough punishment right there, don't you think?

[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:17.340]
Huh?

[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:17.920]
Uh-huh.

[02:26:18.220 --> 02:26:18.840]
Murdering bastard.

[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:21.620]
Having to stay in Britain with all those constipated maniacs.

[02:26:22.580 --> 02:26:24.040]
By the way, we left out British guys.

[02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:26.860]
That should have been right there at the top of the list.

[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:28.360]
I mean, you know, other than Tony Blair.

[02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:30.920]
And Prince William.

[02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:33.360]
What do you think about Prince William with those red cheeks?

[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:35.320]
Here's, uh, Medley. Hello.

[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:36.520]
Hello.

[02:26:36.720 --> 02:26:37.040]
Yes, sir.

[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:38.400]
I got a couple more for you, Neil.

[02:26:38.660 --> 02:26:40.160]
God, I'm going to get a new page, yes.

[02:26:40.500 --> 02:26:41.920]
We got, uh, tow truck drivers.

[02:26:42.460 --> 02:26:43.400]
Tow truck drivers.

[02:26:43.460 --> 02:26:45.300]
Oh, man, they're right up there near the top, buddy.

[02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:46.000]
They're towing it?

[02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:47.160]
You ever have your car towed?

[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:47.640]
Yes.

[02:26:47.900 --> 02:26:50.480]
I have a tow a little more off and, uh, check into that.

[02:26:50.620 --> 02:26:50.940]
Okay.

[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:54.040]
And, uh, also, uh, guys that work in animal hospitals.

[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:54.900]
Oh, yeah, definitely.

[02:26:55.060 --> 02:26:56.160]
Take your dogs to the pet.

[02:26:56.300 --> 02:26:57.020]
What do you think about that?

[02:26:57.200 --> 02:26:58.300]
No question about it.

[02:26:58.320 --> 02:26:58.860]
Hey, Lion, buddy.

[02:26:58.960 --> 02:26:59.400]
Have a good one.

[02:26:59.460 --> 02:26:59.700]
Okay.

[02:27:00.260 --> 02:27:00.760]
Now, that's true.

[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:02.120]
I don't know what it is about that fact.

[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:03.500]
Remember, uh, a few years ago,

[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:05.160]
I think it was like three or four years ago.

[02:27:05.700 --> 02:27:08.080]
We had a sponsor that was like a veterinary school.

[02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:08.600]
Remember that?

[02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:10.760]
And they were advertising on a show.

[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:12.000]
See, this is a misconception.

[02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:14.100]
A lot of people think that because I'm out of the closet

[02:27:14.100 --> 02:27:16.180]
last 200 years, that the majority of the people

[02:27:16.180 --> 02:27:17.800]
in this audience are gay, which is not true.

[02:27:19.260 --> 02:27:20.480]
Um, but they believe that.

[02:27:21.100 --> 02:27:23.180]
Or they think that we've got this gigantic gay audience,

[02:27:23.220 --> 02:27:24.200]
which I also don't believe.

[02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:25.040]
I don't think we really do.

[02:27:25.180 --> 02:27:28.220]
But nevertheless, uh, they advertised on the show

[02:27:28.220 --> 02:27:29.880]
because they said to me at the time,

[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:31.040]
because I went and met with these people.

[02:27:31.060 --> 02:27:33.660]
They said that a lot of gay people get into that animal grooming,

[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:35.780]
veterinary, for whatever reason.

[02:27:35.860 --> 02:27:36.720]
I don't know what that is.

[02:27:37.700 --> 02:27:39.400]
But there's some attraction that's there.

[02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:41.200]
You know, in fact, when you really stop and think about what,

[02:27:41.380 --> 02:27:43.220]
you can understand the attraction when you're artistic,

[02:27:43.380 --> 02:27:44.740]
like, you know, interior decorators,

[02:27:45.220 --> 02:27:48.220]
fashion designers, that makes sense for the stereotypical artsy,

[02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:49.000]
artsy queens.

[02:27:49.220 --> 02:27:50.160]
You know, we understand that.

[02:27:50.460 --> 02:27:51.700]
But there are a lot of these other professions

[02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:53.900]
where there's no rhyme or reason, is there?

[02:27:54.980 --> 02:27:57.040]
You know, like the, uh, prologist, for example.

[02:27:58.580 --> 02:27:59.440]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[02:27:59.540 --> 02:27:59.720]
Hello.

[02:28:00.380 --> 02:28:00.920]
Neil God.

[02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:01.400]
Yes, sir.

[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:02.000]
How you doing?

[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:02.300]
Great.

[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:04.300]
I got a couple for your list here.

[02:28:04.500 --> 02:28:06.400]
Although the guy stole my thunder on weather, man.

[02:28:06.740 --> 02:28:07.820]
Uh, how about movie critics?

[02:28:07.820 --> 02:28:11.000]
Yeah, well, now that I said before since Gene Sisko died,

[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:12.280]
there isn't one straight guy left.

[02:28:13.380 --> 02:28:16.840]
And, uh, including, how about hockey coaching for the Alphia?

[02:28:17.540 --> 02:28:17.800]
Okay.

[02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:18.300]

[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:19.420]
Hahaha.

[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:20.800]

[02:28:21.580 --> 02:28:21.840]
Ow.

[02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:22.820]
Ow.

[02:28:23.020 --> 02:28:23.020]

[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:24.160]
Oh, boy, it's funny.

[02:28:24.380 --> 02:28:26.820]
You know, he was suspended those two games for throwing his stick,

[02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:28.040]
even it and the stick, too.

[02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:29.280]
And they won the two games.

[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:30.780]
They had won a game in 12 games.

[02:28:31.300 --> 02:28:32.260]
Roger gets stuck upstairs.

[02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:33.640]
Of course, we weren't talking about Roger.

[02:28:33.780 --> 02:28:34.000]
Were we?

[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:34.260]
No.

[02:28:34.500 --> 02:28:35.680]
Roger gets his stuck up there.

[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:37.500]
And he went two games in a row.

[02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:38.580]
Including over my lease.

[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:41.180]
Oh, boy, it must have just been a coincidence.

[02:28:41.660 --> 02:28:43.160]
That was just rumors you heard in any way.

[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:45.540]
And by the way, you didn't read that article by David J.

[02:28:45.620 --> 02:28:46.640]
Neil Rogers getting married.

[02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:47.260]
Didn't you read that?

[02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:47.500]
Uh-huh.

[02:28:47.560 --> 02:28:48.280]
Yeah, he's getting married.

[02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:48.780]
Hahaha.

[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:50.140]
Or he got married or something like that.

[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:52.460]
That was just nasty rumors.

[02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:53.240]
We'll check with rumor.

[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:55.140]
I'm in fact, I'm going to ask rumor about that this weekend

[02:28:55.140 --> 02:28:56.280]
when he abys his dinner.

[02:28:56.680 --> 02:28:58.520]
Anybody on the team believe in rumors buying his dinner?

[02:28:58.680 --> 02:28:58.860]
No.

[02:29:00.220 --> 02:29:03.480]
In fact, I hear Scott Melonbees got a bet with the entire panther organization.

[02:29:03.720 --> 02:29:04.800]
A heavy duty cash, too.

[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:05.920]
By the way, that when the check comes,

[02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:08.740]
rumor will say, oh, Jay, left that damn wall at home again.

[02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:11.860]
Or when he opens up the wall to get those credit cards,

[02:29:11.940 --> 02:29:13.280]
the moths will get in the way.

[02:29:14.380 --> 02:29:15.300]
That's what that was then.

[02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:17.580]
Mom, I'm busy reading a very important facts here.

[02:29:18.340 --> 02:29:21.700]
A fake facts from somebody allegedly known as Dave

[02:29:21.700 --> 02:29:23.100]
from Sterling appraisal.

[02:29:24.140 --> 02:29:26.160]
Dear Mr. Rogers, I'm writing to complain.

[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:27.480]
Writing to complain.

[02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:28.400]
That's T-O-O-O.

[02:29:30.140 --> 02:29:31.540]
T-O-O.

[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:34.400]
Complain about your vulgar V-U-L-G-E-R.

[02:29:34.940 --> 02:29:35.820]
Language on the ear.

[02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:39.040]
Not only is it not only is disgusting with two S's,

[02:29:39.160 --> 02:29:41.920]
D-I-S-S-D-U-S-D-I-N-G, but not appropriate as well.

[02:29:42.380 --> 02:29:46.120]
I am, period, as of this day, filing F-I-L-E-I-N-G,

[02:29:46.540 --> 02:29:49.060]
a report with the FCC in proper 30s.

[02:29:49.300 --> 02:29:50.920]
Remember Mr. Rogers, you reach a large audience

[02:29:50.920 --> 02:29:52.540]
and majority of these people are little children.

[02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:54.800]
A majority of these people are little children.

[02:29:54.940 --> 02:29:56.100]
I thought they were all in school right now.

[02:29:56.220 --> 02:29:56.700]
Are they in school?

[02:29:56.920 --> 02:29:57.060]
No.

[02:29:57.480 --> 02:29:59.060]
So please keep the assholes to a minimum.

[02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:00.900]
And all regarding your poll question,

[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:04.280]
you left out radio personality spelled with a T-Y-S.

[02:30:05.580 --> 02:30:07.280]
Another fake facts with one of our chronic

[02:30:07.280 --> 02:30:08.680]
affects his hand writing in the bottle.

[02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:10.000]
Pretty weak.

[02:30:11.720 --> 02:30:14.040]
Well, I mean, maybe he's talking about many of the people

[02:30:14.040 --> 02:30:15.880]
have the IQ of little children,

[02:30:16.220 --> 02:30:17.720]
including all these illiterate people

[02:30:17.720 --> 02:30:19.200]
that would like the concerned citizens

[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:19.920]
that we heard from yesterday.

[02:30:20.980 --> 02:30:22.400]
Let's see, post office workers.

[02:30:22.540 --> 02:30:23.940]
Yeah, post office workers, nobody call that

[02:30:23.940 --> 02:30:25.000]
and they absolutely correct.

[02:30:25.140 --> 02:30:26.180]
I can name some names there.

[02:30:27.300 --> 02:30:28.760]
Touled class of workers with the exception of

[02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:30.060]
our good friend, Sylvia.

[02:30:31.260 --> 02:30:32.760]
Chefs, weight trainers.

[02:30:33.680 --> 02:30:35.280]
And then under the dike list,

[02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:36.660]
they've got the PE coaches,

[02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:39.480]
women cops and FedEx drivers.

[02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:41.720]
Also, which is, I'm not,

[02:30:41.820 --> 02:30:43.160]
I drive a Honda, I'm not a Faggot,

[02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:43.680]
I'm a breeder.

[02:30:43.800 --> 02:30:44.640]
Yeah, that's what we're worried about.

[02:30:46.400 --> 02:30:47.920]
Let's see, here's another one for our list.

[02:30:48.380 --> 02:30:49.040]
Copy your tickets.

[02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:50.520]
It says all copy your technicians,

[02:30:50.840 --> 02:30:51.880]
every single one of them.

[02:30:53.400 --> 02:30:54.560]
Each and every one.

[02:30:56.720 --> 02:30:58.220]
Okay, well, we're learning a lot here today.

[02:30:58.240 --> 02:30:59.240]
I'll tell you that even I'm learning.

[02:30:59.580 --> 02:31:00.980]
Here's a lady in North Miami Beach.

[02:31:01.120 --> 02:31:01.240]
Hello.

[02:31:01.240 --> 02:31:03.060]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

[02:31:03.060 --> 02:31:05.200]
Okay, Ken, Ken Block wants to get in.

[02:31:06.120 --> 02:31:08.140]
Ken Block, he was on with our Monday.

[02:31:09.180 --> 02:31:11.560]
You know, I was thinking about him coming to work this morning.

[02:31:12.980 --> 02:31:14.080]
About the fact that let's see,

[02:31:14.180 --> 02:31:15.600]
three and a half years we're going to be out of here.

[02:31:15.920 --> 02:31:17.240]
I'll be almost 60 years old.

[02:31:17.340 --> 02:31:18.560]
So he's going to be, you have to be like,

[02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:20.480]
I don't know, 40 in the early 40s.

[02:31:22.800 --> 02:31:24.020]
What's he going to do at that point?

[02:31:24.400 --> 02:31:27.020]
What's he going to do when I take off for unknown places at that?

[02:31:27.140 --> 02:31:27.900]
Well, what's he going to do?

[02:31:27.900 --> 02:31:31.700]
Well, because that'll be like almost 30 years of his life

[02:31:31.700 --> 02:31:32.760]
that he's been doing this.

[02:31:33.020 --> 02:31:33.380]
Wow.

[02:31:34.240 --> 02:31:36.660]
You own me's and believe me, I don't want nothing from you,

[02:31:36.740 --> 02:31:38.040]
but you own me like something.

[02:31:38.620 --> 02:31:40.320]
Like about $10 million would be nice.

[02:31:41.280 --> 02:31:42.220]
Does he have a job, you think?

[02:31:42.400 --> 02:31:42.560]
No.

[02:31:42.960 --> 02:31:43.560]
Does he have a wife?

[02:31:43.720 --> 02:31:43.900]
No.

[02:31:44.540 --> 02:31:45.500]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:31:45.720 --> 02:31:45.880]
Hello.

[02:31:47.740 --> 02:31:48.540]
Mobile in Miami.

[02:31:49.280 --> 02:31:49.460]
Hello.

[02:31:49.760 --> 02:31:50.080]
Yes, sir.

[02:31:50.660 --> 02:31:50.880]
Neo.

[02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:51.400]
Yes.

[02:31:51.680 --> 02:31:52.520]
One more for the list.

[02:31:53.480 --> 02:31:53.840]
Bodybuilder.

[02:31:54.460 --> 02:31:54.940]
Got it.

[02:31:55.460 --> 02:31:55.900]
Thank you.

[02:31:56.080 --> 02:31:56.660]
Okay, thank you.

[02:31:56.800 --> 02:31:57.100]
Got that.

[02:31:58.280 --> 02:31:58.680]
Bodybuilder.

[02:31:58.740 --> 02:31:58.920]
See.

[02:31:59.500 --> 02:32:00.960]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[02:32:01.120 --> 02:32:03.200]
pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:04.660]
Here's Bokeh.

[02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:04.880]
Hello.

[02:32:05.560 --> 02:32:05.960]
Hello.

[02:32:06.200 --> 02:32:06.520]
Yes, sir.

[02:32:06.700 --> 02:32:07.500]
Neo, I got one for the list.

[02:32:07.700 --> 02:32:07.940]
Okay.

[02:32:08.260 --> 02:32:10.000]
How about people that work on cruise ship?

[02:32:10.620 --> 02:32:11.560]
Cruise ship people, huh?

[02:32:11.840 --> 02:32:12.380]
Yeah, definitely.

[02:32:12.880 --> 02:32:14.340]
No, maybe they learned a lot about cruising.

[02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:15.440]
Yeah, nuts.

[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:16.280]
Okay.

[02:32:16.420 --> 02:32:16.780]
Thanks.

[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:17.420]
Thank you, sir.

[02:32:18.100 --> 02:32:20.480]
The list, it keeps growing and growing and growing

[02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:21.080]
and growing.

[02:32:22.240 --> 02:32:22.640]
Unbelievable.

[02:32:23.440 --> 02:32:25.020]
Never seen my wildest dreams.

[02:32:25.220 --> 02:32:26.480]
I never envisioned anything like this.

[02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:29.900]
Where's that thing that Oya Jennifer said?

[02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:31.600]
It just keeps getting bigger.

[02:32:31.840 --> 02:32:32.000]
Right.

[02:32:33.240 --> 02:32:34.480]
Here's a lady in Phoenix.

[02:32:34.700 --> 02:32:34.860]
Hello.

[02:32:35.300 --> 02:32:37.880]
Hi, you know, I'm going from Phoenix and I

[02:32:37.880 --> 02:32:40.400]
kind of like a new listener, but I'd like to

[02:32:40.400 --> 02:32:42.820]
yell at you and ask a favorite to think time.

[02:32:42.900 --> 02:32:43.160]
Okay.

[02:32:43.720 --> 02:32:46.500]
First off, I want you to play two sound lights for me.

[02:32:46.620 --> 02:32:46.800]
Two.

[02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:49.620]
Do you want to?

[02:32:50.180 --> 02:32:50.500]
And?

[02:32:50.660 --> 02:32:51.260]
Do you want to what?

[02:32:52.060 --> 02:32:52.300]
What?

[02:32:53.620 --> 02:32:55.400]
If you, if you, you know,

[02:32:56.480 --> 02:32:57.120]
seeing in.

[02:32:57.120 --> 02:32:58.040]
Or if you see K.

[02:32:58.240 --> 02:32:58.320]
Yeah.

[02:32:58.440 --> 02:32:58.600]
Yes.

[02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:00.400]
And then the Helen Keller song.

[02:33:00.980 --> 02:33:01.240]
Okay.

[02:33:01.640 --> 02:33:03.560]
And then the thing I want to yell at you.

[02:33:03.660 --> 02:33:05.220]
Now you're going to, you asked me for two and I said,

[02:33:05.220 --> 02:33:06.440]
okay, now you're going to yell at me.

[02:33:06.680 --> 02:33:08.040]
Well, I probably not a good technique,

[02:33:08.060 --> 02:33:08.940]
but go ahead and give it a shot.

[02:33:09.240 --> 02:33:09.740]
Well, okay.

[02:33:09.920 --> 02:33:11.160]
So you know what your other sound bite,

[02:33:11.260 --> 02:33:13.780]
where you yell at this, where this one person is yelling.

[02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:15.560]
Look at that behind.

[02:33:16.540 --> 02:33:17.720]
You know, it's like you're kind of taking,

[02:33:17.720 --> 02:33:21.700]
you know, a stab at some people that are not as

[02:33:21.700 --> 02:33:22.580]
thin as other people.

[02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:24.840]
At fat people?

[02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:25.400]
Yeah.

[02:33:25.560 --> 02:33:26.200]
What's wrong with that?

[02:33:26.320 --> 02:33:27.040]
I'm a fat person.

[02:33:27.160 --> 02:33:28.680]
What's wrong with making fun of fat people?

[02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:30.400]
Well, if you were blind, would you say,

[02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:32.180]
would you make fun of blind people?

[02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:33.240]
If you were...

[02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:34.300]
No, I'm not blind,

[02:33:34.320 --> 02:33:35.640]
but I still make fun of blind people.

[02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:36.420]
So what's wrong with that?

[02:33:36.820 --> 02:33:39.040]
Well, you're going to have a sense of humor to survive.

[02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:41.080]
I have a sense of humor in almost everything.

[02:33:41.300 --> 02:33:41.480]
Right.

[02:33:41.620 --> 02:33:42.600]
Except certain things.

[02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:43.320]
Except you have fat.

[02:33:43.460 --> 02:33:44.120]
Are you a fat cow?

[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:46.080]
How dare you?

[02:33:46.620 --> 02:33:48.060]
Well, I don't, I've never seen you.

[02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:49.660]
I just asked and already heard your name.

[02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:50.460]
Well, now, it's like it's okay.

[02:33:50.460 --> 02:33:52.780]
The fact that you're in sense, you must be a fat cow.

[02:33:53.400 --> 02:33:55.460]
The fact that you reacted the way you did.

[02:33:55.700 --> 02:33:56.920]
How dare you?

[02:33:57.360 --> 02:33:58.040]
You just don't...

[02:33:58.040 --> 02:33:58.820]
You just don't...

[02:33:58.820 --> 02:34:00.920]
Okay, are you pleasingly plump?

[02:34:01.420 --> 02:34:02.080]
I'm normal.

[02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:04.340]
So then why would you be upset about fat?

[02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:06.740]
If you're normal, then why are you upset about having a big fat ass?

[02:34:06.940 --> 02:34:09.120]
Are you normal like sides that have a fat ass?

[02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:10.660]
Because then you ought to come over here.

[02:34:10.760 --> 02:34:11.360]
Forget about Phoenix.

[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:13.140]
They like fat asses down here,

[02:34:13.260 --> 02:34:14.560]
especially the Cuban guys.

[02:34:14.740 --> 02:34:15.500]
They're into food again.

[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:16.000]
Oh, you're food.

[02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:16.600]
Oh, yeah.

[02:34:16.900 --> 02:34:17.680]
I'm just...

[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:18.480]
Come on down here, sweetheart.

[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:19.960]
You'll be busy 15 hours a day.

[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:22.240]
Oh, please, how dare you.

[02:34:22.340 --> 02:34:23.360]
Yeah, how dare I?

[02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:23.700]
Yeah.

[02:34:24.380 --> 02:34:24.780]
Okay.

[02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:25.920]
You...

[02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:27.400]
Anyway, so will you play my frog?

[02:34:27.580 --> 02:34:28.160]
Sure, no problem.

[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:29.220]
And by the way,

[02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:30.280]
loosen weight.

[02:34:31.340 --> 02:34:31.920]
I see that.

[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:32.580]
What's wrong with that?

[02:34:32.620 --> 02:34:33.380]
She's a fat bitch.

[02:34:33.540 --> 02:34:34.760]
Okay, what's wrong with that?

[02:34:35.060 --> 02:34:35.900]
How dare you?

[02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:38.480]
Well, I mean, that answered the question right off the bat, huh?

[02:34:39.340 --> 02:34:39.480]
Right?

[02:34:46.180 --> 02:34:46.860]
I...

[02:34:46.860 --> 02:34:49.240]
I had a checkmate day.

[02:34:49.860 --> 02:34:51.800]
One day she blew away.

[02:34:52.720 --> 02:34:55.380]
To Tio, I know where the moon is blue.

[02:34:55.520 --> 02:34:56.960]
The moon is blue.

[02:34:57.820 --> 02:34:59.940]
But with our right wing censorship,

[02:35:00.980 --> 02:35:02.400]
there are words you mustn't slip.

[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:06.420]
Who do we tell you how I feel for K?

[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:08.300]
Hey, it's Friday.

[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:12.460]
So...

[02:35:12.460 --> 02:35:14.640]
If you see K and C. Y.

[02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:18.700]
I'll see you in Tio, I'll tune.

[02:35:20.020 --> 02:35:21.540]
And now if you see K,

[02:35:21.920 --> 02:35:23.620]
tell her I'm a service day.

[02:35:24.220 --> 02:35:26.560]
And the FCC won't mind me saying this.

[02:35:26.940 --> 02:35:29.640]
So I'm not supposed to say how if you see K?

[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:30.840]
Take her in.

[02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:31.860]
Tell me, say,

[02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:34.080]
that after this transmission,

[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:35.980]
I'll be out in 90 days.

[02:35:36.740 --> 02:35:39.000]
Oh, if you see K and C. Y.

[02:35:39.800 --> 02:35:42.340]
Then I'll see you in Tio.

[02:35:42.460 --> 02:35:43.840]
I don't wanna go,

[02:35:44.160 --> 02:35:46.380]
but gotta see you in Tio.

[02:35:46.540 --> 02:35:47.240]
I don't know.

[02:35:50.580 --> 02:35:50.840]
Oh!

[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:55.720]
So, so, so much of she was a little bit chunky, huh?

[02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:56.240]
Porky.

[02:35:56.240 --> 02:35:58.120]
She really did get porky there at the end, isn't she?

[02:35:58.980 --> 02:35:59.640]
She's a cow.

[02:36:00.080 --> 02:36:01.140]
How dare you?

[02:36:01.700 --> 02:36:03.600]
That's a dead tip off. That was a dead giveaway, huh?

[02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:05.760]
I don't understand that.

[02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:07.500]
I've been making fun of fat people all my life.

[02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:10.200]
If I were slim and perfect, like some people out there, not too many,

[02:36:10.500 --> 02:36:11.740]
then it would be pretty nasty.

[02:36:11.880 --> 02:36:12.740]
I'd probably still do it.

[02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:15.540]
But I mean, the fact that I'm fat, you know, people have said,

[02:36:15.540 --> 02:36:16.720]
hey, look at that fat slub.

[02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:17.660]
Huh? What's wrong with that?

[02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:20.940]
If you wanna eat like a pig and look like a pig,

[02:36:20.940 --> 02:36:22.320]
then people are gonna call you a pig.

[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:23.720]
And it's just a question.

[02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:25.400]
If you want people to say, hey, look at that, you know?

[02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:27.500]
Or if you wanna say, look at that fat cow.

[02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:31.660]
Here's the great facts by the way that's got some of these fat occupations.

[02:36:32.060 --> 02:36:33.880]
Now, I don't want I think maybe stretching it a little bit.

[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:36.880]
Any male teacher at Columbus High, a little bit carrying away.

[02:36:38.360 --> 02:36:40.440]
Any soldier, especially the Coast Guard,

[02:36:40.540 --> 02:36:42.160]
it says, and what it says, don't drop the coast.

[02:36:43.260 --> 02:36:44.820]
And it says, former Boy Scout,

[02:36:45.080 --> 02:36:48.640]
but how about one that I came up with reading that scout troop leaders?

[02:36:49.540 --> 02:36:50.800]
Huh? Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts?

[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:53.040]
Not all, just many.

[02:36:53.500 --> 02:36:54.040]
Don't say most.

[02:36:54.660 --> 02:36:55.900]
Any man that knows how to sew.

[02:36:56.120 --> 02:36:56.440]
Oh!

[02:36:57.540 --> 02:36:57.980]
Darn.

[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:00.560]
Male masseuse.

[02:37:01.560 --> 02:37:02.800]
Men's fitting room attendant.

[02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:04.300]
It's the inventors of the glory hole.

[02:37:05.020 --> 02:37:06.940]
Radio Taukshoe Host on QAM from 10-2.

[02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:09.460]
And also it says, I don't know Ed Berliner.

[02:37:09.900 --> 02:37:11.040]
Or is that Berliner?

[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:12.280]
How does that say that again?

[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:13.780]
Ed Berliner.

[02:37:14.060 --> 02:37:14.520]
Berliner.

[02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:15.180]
Oh!

[02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:16.660]
Woo!

[02:37:18.780 --> 02:37:22.680]
In fact, you know, they spent so much for the Zingel Package that after it came back like that,

[02:37:22.820 --> 02:37:23.560]
they had a candy zest.

[02:37:24.220 --> 02:37:26.000]
Because they didn't have anybody here named Ed Berliner.

[02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:28.460]
What a schmuck he is.

[02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:29.160]
He's an apple.

[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:30.000]
Oh, God.

[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:33.840]
You know, it's one thing if somebody's talented and they're arrogant and stuck up, you know,

[02:37:33.940 --> 02:37:35.840]
and got a big opinion of themselves.

[02:37:36.180 --> 02:37:38.380]
But when somebody's just a piece of trash,

[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.280]
like no talent piece of a turd,

[02:37:41.340 --> 02:37:43.480]
who really thinks he's a hot shot like Ed Berliner.

[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:46.040]
And everybody despises him like poison.

[02:37:46.380 --> 02:37:48.780]
Then, you know, you scrape to the bottom of the barrel.

[02:37:49.260 --> 02:37:50.560]
As in, how dare you?

[02:37:51.180 --> 02:37:52.820]
She was great all the way from Fieness Nolis.

[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:55.620]
She won your heart in the miracle worker.

[02:37:56.220 --> 02:37:57.380]
Despite her handicaps,

[02:37:57.920 --> 02:37:59.920]
she left behind a lifetime of achievements.

[02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:05.800]
And now, with the discovery of rare audio tapes found in a basement somewhere in New Jersey.

[02:38:06.340 --> 02:38:09.020]
Death Jam Records makes available to you.

[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:11.900]
Helen Keller, St. LeBlood.

[02:38:11.900 --> 02:38:13.740]
Where?

[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:17.560]
Where?

[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:21.140]
Where?

[02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:22.800]
Where?

[02:38:23.600 --> 02:38:24.300]
Where?

[02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:24.320]
Where?

[02:38:24.340 --> 02:38:24.340]

[02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:30.260]
A series of recordings from the 1950s by Helen Keller herself,

[02:38:30.800 --> 02:38:32.780]
whaling out of cow into sound.

[02:38:34.500 --> 02:38:35.500]
Where?

[02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:39.060]
Where?

[02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:39.080]

[02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:42.040]
To order yours.

[02:38:42.060 --> 02:38:43.620]
How do you credit card rate?

[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:45.240]
They call 1-800.

[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:48.520]
WOOOOO!

[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:49.280]
Order now.

[02:38:49.380 --> 02:38:52.720]
Get a bonus list of two lists by Marley Nightlin and Johnny Ray.

[02:38:57.420 --> 02:38:57.980]
WOOOOO!

[02:38:59.300 --> 02:38:59.860]
WOOOOO!

[02:39:00.120 --> 02:39:04.960]
144-560 W Kima Hankover Show from Shulestake 2 coming up at 2 o'clock.

[02:39:04.980 --> 02:39:05.840]
Then we got the booster.

[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:08.700]
6-7 very briefly.

[02:39:09.220 --> 02:39:11.280]
Because we don't want to interrupt his 4-5 feedings tonight.

[02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:12.840]
Come on, let us some weight, Bougweyah.

[02:39:13.260 --> 02:39:15.980]
We don't want people to call him from feedings about what you're a big fat ass you've got.

[02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:16.680]
Come on, Bougue.

[02:39:16.860 --> 02:39:19.140]
You're a good guy, but God are you dying over there.

[02:39:19.780 --> 02:39:21.280]
And then 7 o'clock we got the pre-game show.

[02:39:21.420 --> 02:39:22.760]
7-30 Rangers in the Panthers.

[02:39:22.900 --> 02:39:23.560]
Are we ready?

[02:39:23.660 --> 02:39:23.860]
Oh!

[02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:25.220]
Panther is going to kick their ass.

[02:39:26.020 --> 02:39:26.860]
No, Bob Eldon.

[02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:28.680]
He'll be ready in due time.

[02:39:29.400 --> 02:39:31.700]
Like Linda Blair said in the Exorcist in time.

[02:39:32.140 --> 02:39:32.740]
Right, remember that?

[02:39:32.980 --> 02:39:33.520]
Do it again.

[02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:34.280]
In time.

[02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:35.500]
You know what, I'm good and ready.

[02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:38.640]
Lucky saying, what do you want for 10 million years?

[02:39:39.100 --> 02:39:39.780]
Want me to play Hurt?

[02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:43.020]
So anyway, here's Carolyn again who's hot to try on this.

[02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:43.960]
She says more lesbians.

[02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:44.460]
Nons.

[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:45.420]
How could we leave that out?

[02:39:45.420 --> 02:39:45.940]
So obvious.

[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:46.780]
Nons.

[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.740]
And gay guys, airline reservations people.

[02:39:51.860 --> 02:39:52.040]
Oh yeah.

[02:39:52.260 --> 02:39:53.500]
So many people at the airport.

[02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:56.220]
Okay, if you go out to Miami International for Lauderdale airport.

[02:39:56.660 --> 02:39:57.940]
The people, I'm not talking about the tourists,

[02:39:57.940 --> 02:39:59.720]
but the people are working in the airports.

[02:40:01.380 --> 02:40:02.080]
Can you end up?

[02:40:02.180 --> 02:40:03.300]
Of course, I was, it's funny.

[02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:05.840]
I was taking a leak at MIA last time waiting for a plane.

[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:08.040]
And I was sticking to myself.

[02:40:08.180 --> 02:40:10.200]
Can you imagine, like in the wee hours of the morning?

[02:40:10.260 --> 02:40:12.920]
Because late at night, these aren't airports where there's like a lot of

[02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:15.020]
flight action late at night.

[02:40:15.380 --> 02:40:16.280]
A lot of tourist action.

[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:17.540]
There's other kinds of action.

[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:20.500]
And I was just imagining myself, what must be going on there late at night?

[02:40:20.820 --> 02:40:21.300]
At the airports.

[02:40:21.980 --> 02:40:22.620]
You know what I'm talking about?

[02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:23.680]
Oh my god.

[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:25.280]
Talk about Woon-Woon-Frold Glory.

[02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:27.920]
Here's the fact that says I'm a 22-year-old.

[02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:29.360]
Holy-Oh, straight, of course.

[02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:30.380]
Of course, we believe in.

[02:40:30.620 --> 02:40:31.120]
We believe in.

[02:40:31.220 --> 02:40:31.380]
No.

[02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:31.880]
Yeah, we do.

[02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:36.300]
Worked several years ago at Structure, the clothing store.

[02:40:36.420 --> 02:40:40.220]
And I'm certain that the retail fashion industry has the most homosexuals working within

[02:40:40.220 --> 02:40:41.700]
a van in industry in the world.

[02:40:41.860 --> 02:40:42.640]
That's possible.

[02:40:43.320 --> 02:40:44.800]
The retail fashion industry.

[02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:48.720]
On behalf of everyone in our office and behalf of the students at FIU, etc.

[02:40:49.400 --> 02:40:50.940]
We love your ass and the rest of you, too.

[02:40:51.540 --> 02:40:52.360]
Thank you, Holy-Oh.

[02:40:53.300 --> 02:40:53.980]
So there you go.

[02:40:54.100 --> 02:40:56.820]
We really open up a Pandora's box today.

[02:40:56.820 --> 02:40:58.040]
Here's West Palm Beach.

[02:40:58.040 --> 02:40:58.300]
Hello.

[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:00.580]
Yeah, I got two more for you.

[02:41:00.860 --> 02:41:00.880]
Yes.

[02:41:01.620 --> 02:41:03.360]
Guys who work at Pier One imports.

[02:41:04.620 --> 02:41:05.720]
And jet skiers.

[02:41:06.320 --> 02:41:07.080]
Jet skiers?

[02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:07.880]
Yeah.

[02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:09.340]
Those guys are cookies.

[02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:09.980]
Okay.

[02:41:10.260 --> 02:41:10.620]
Thank you.

[02:41:10.820 --> 02:41:11.080]
See ya.

[02:41:12.140 --> 02:41:12.940]
Jet skiers.

[02:41:13.140 --> 02:41:15.300]
Like that one from Canada that was doing all that bad weed.

[02:41:15.500 --> 02:41:15.820]
What was he?

[02:41:15.900 --> 02:41:16.700]
He was in the jet skier.

[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:18.480]
He was a snowboarder.

[02:41:18.740 --> 02:41:19.140]
Snowboarder.

[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:21.140]
Yeah, he's just a border.

[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:24.680]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:27.300]
He's just a border.

[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:28.200]
He's all he is.

[02:41:28.700 --> 02:41:29.620]
What was his name again?

[02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:30.500]
You'll never know.

[02:41:31.640 --> 02:41:33.440]
You talk about five seconds of fame.

[02:41:34.780 --> 02:41:36.000]
I remember he was blonde.

[02:41:36.180 --> 02:41:37.220]
I remember he wasn't too bad.

[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:39.260]
He looked okay from the right angle.

[02:41:39.780 --> 02:41:40.880]
But his name?

[02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:41.680]
No chance.

[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:44.080]
Goes to show you, man, how the media manipulators.

[02:41:44.380 --> 02:41:47.840]
For a couple of seconds, we think something that is really exciting and important and big.

[02:41:47.940 --> 02:41:48.760]
I don't know how big it was.

[02:41:49.100 --> 02:41:49.920]
But there you go.

[02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:51.920]
Shrunky to toe anonymity.

[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:53.520]
Took his weed and went back to Vancouver.

[02:41:55.040 --> 02:41:56.440]
Here is a mobile invoker.

[02:41:56.520 --> 02:41:56.720]
Hello.

[02:41:58.380 --> 02:41:59.140]
Mobile invoker.

[02:41:59.620 --> 02:42:00.320]
Hey, how you doing now?

[02:42:00.460 --> 02:42:00.620]
Great.

[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:02.480]
All right, here's one for you.

[02:42:02.700 --> 02:42:03.900]
How about all Disney World employees?

[02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:08.800]
Yeah, we were saying before most of the most amusement park, but Disney of course has got a lot.

[02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:09.460]
They come first.

[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:10.200]
Yeah.

[02:42:10.660 --> 02:42:11.560]
All right, see you later.

[02:42:11.660 --> 02:42:12.260]
Okay, see ya.

[02:42:12.740 --> 02:42:16.440]
How about, and getting, not just Disney, but how about clowns?

[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:17.580]
Huh?

[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:18.540]
Isn't that a good one?

[02:42:18.540 --> 02:42:20.280]
Anybody ever know a straight clown?

[02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:20.460]
No.

[02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:22.620]
In fact, that's gonna be our definitive pull question.

[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:26.160]
Which one is the most unanimous with virtually no exception?

[02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:27.460]
Clowns or priest?

[02:42:27.720 --> 02:42:30.260]
I think that's Nippentuck, Nek-Nek, nose to nose.

[02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:32.080]
Clowns.

[02:42:34.400 --> 02:42:35.500]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[02:42:35.720 --> 02:42:35.720]

[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:36.400]
Hi, Neil.

[02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:36.940]
Yes, sir.

[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:37.740]
I got three for you.

[02:42:37.980 --> 02:42:38.140]
Okay.

[02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:40.420]
Oh, by the way, that restaurant was Vinny's, you're trying to think of it.

[02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:41.260]
Vinny's, that's right.

[02:42:41.380 --> 02:42:42.080]
What a memory, huh?

[02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:43.320]
Oh, boy.

[02:42:43.780 --> 02:42:45.900]
Okay, as far as the girls, that's Roller Derby.

[02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:47.540]
Roller Derby unanimous.

[02:42:47.540 --> 02:42:48.240]
I'm not scared until you die.

[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:49.960]
I'm for the guy who's got two for you.

[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:53.020]
Anybody who works at an antique store or owns one?

[02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:53.340]
Yeah.

[02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:54.560]
And arc galleries.

[02:42:55.320 --> 02:42:56.580]
Arc-yell, Archie Fartzi.

[02:42:56.920 --> 02:42:57.060]
Yeah.

[02:42:57.280 --> 02:42:57.960]
Okay, thank you, sir.

[02:42:58.060 --> 02:42:58.200]
Okay.

[02:42:58.420 --> 02:42:58.940]
God bless you.

[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:02.220]
5670560, 0560 on the AT.

[02:43:02.380 --> 02:43:06.300]
We've got a list here from here to guide their Massachusetts, men, for as long as my arm and elbow

[02:43:06.300 --> 02:43:07.240]
and everything put together.

[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:08.120]
Unbelievable.

[02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:13.140]
Which goes to show you, boy, that there would just, every, we're all over the place.

[02:43:13.140 --> 02:43:17.520]
It's just, I mean, no matter where you look under every rock and nook and cranny.

[02:43:18.460 --> 02:43:20.460]
Not to mention that George Step on top of us.

[02:43:21.340 --> 02:43:22.040]
Here's Hi, Alia.

[02:43:22.140 --> 02:43:22.300]
Hello.

[02:43:23.060 --> 02:43:24.460]
Yeah, it's a heterosexual world.

[02:43:24.580 --> 02:43:25.380]
What are you going to deal with it?

[02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:26.080]
Yeah, it is.

[02:43:26.300 --> 02:43:27.640]
It is a heterosexual world.

[02:43:27.800 --> 02:43:27.900]
Yeah.

[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.900]
That you fag think that everybody in the Roku is a homo.

[02:43:31.020 --> 02:43:32.660]
Have you felt like a homo to me?

[02:43:32.840 --> 02:43:33.620]
No, I'm not homo.

[02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:34.140]
I am straight.

[02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:35.120]
I like those boobs.

[02:43:35.400 --> 02:43:36.380]
You sound like a real homo.

[02:43:36.460 --> 02:43:37.080]
I like those.

[02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:38.040]
You sound like a fudge bag.

[02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:39.160]
Why is it that every time I walk around?

[02:43:39.160 --> 02:43:40.060]
Why do you have a sock?

[02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:41.100]
How come you have a sock on?

[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:41.740]
Did you say dick?

[02:43:41.740 --> 02:43:43.320]
How come you have a sock over your phone?

[02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:44.480]
Like you in there for my quick walk.

[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:45.220]
How come you have a sock?

[02:43:45.220 --> 02:43:47.360]
When you take the sock off your phone, I'll talk to you.

[02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:48.440]
I don't have a sock on the phone.

[02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:49.740]
Yeah, you have a sock over it.

[02:43:49.780 --> 02:43:50.600]
Maybe not over the phone.

[02:43:52.940 --> 02:43:53.220]
Yeah.

[02:43:53.500 --> 02:43:53.980]
What are you saying?

[02:43:54.120 --> 02:43:54.980]
He said something about dick.

[02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:57.260]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:43:57.640 --> 02:43:59.740]
And we don't, we don't assume that everybody is gay.

[02:43:59.860 --> 02:44:01.540]
It's just that I think it was an interesting point.

[02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:02.360]
We know that wrestlers.

[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:04.220]
And of course, most of these people that are calling in,

[02:44:04.220 --> 02:44:05.700]
they are heterosexual, of course.

[02:44:06.180 --> 02:44:06.500]
Aren't they?

[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:07.000]
Yeah.

[02:44:07.180 --> 02:44:07.660]
There you go.

[02:44:08.380 --> 02:44:09.680]
But even they recognize you.

[02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:10.880]
Why are you going to get with a program?

[02:44:10.980 --> 02:44:11.720]
See, that's what bothers you.

[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:14.500]
This is the whole purpose of the program today.

[02:44:14.620 --> 02:44:17.120]
It's to point out to people like you who can't deal with it.

[02:44:17.220 --> 02:44:18.440]
You're just going to have to deal with it.

[02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:18.760]
Okay?

[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:21.600]
The most important, the most influential, the artist,

[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:23.520]
the athletic, the everything, everything.

[02:44:23.680 --> 02:44:23.840]
Everywhere you go.

[02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:24.880]
Just like ABC tomorrow.

[02:44:25.060 --> 02:44:26.680]
And I think I've got those Fag figure skaters on here.

[02:44:26.860 --> 02:44:27.900]
Probably get a 90 share.

[02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:31.320]
They had the Academy Award, the Oscars on the other end.

[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:34.260]
What percentage of those people in Hollywood do you think are Fags, huh?

[02:44:35.140 --> 02:44:37.440]
I hear people on the station talking about the Academy Awards.

[02:44:37.700 --> 02:44:40.260]
But they'll never fess up to how much percentage of those people are.

[02:44:40.260 --> 02:44:45.340]
Those artsy, artsy actors and actresses and directors and cinematographers and make up people.

[02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:47.840]
And best boys and best girls and whatever.

[02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:49.620]
What do you think they call them best boy for, huh?

[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:51.320]
Everything about that.

[02:44:51.940 --> 02:44:51.940]

[02:44:53.180 --> 02:44:53.580]
Asshole.

[02:44:54.340 --> 02:44:55.460]
He's got a sock on it.

[02:44:56.860 --> 02:45:00.400]
Maybe you're just hanging out with Dick Clark at the sock hop.

[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:02.820]
You think you ever hung out with Dick at the sock hop?

[02:45:03.300 --> 02:45:05.920]
10-D4-2 at 5-60-WQ-A-M.

[02:45:06.260 --> 02:45:07.440]
If you want to get hooked up.

[02:45:08.740 --> 02:45:09.900]
I love those people.

[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:14.540]
Hey listen, we're not going to out your pal.

[02:45:14.540 --> 02:45:15.180]
Don't worry about it.
