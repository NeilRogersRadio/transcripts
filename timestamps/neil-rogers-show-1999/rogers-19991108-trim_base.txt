[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.940]
and he and it is.

[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.000]
But you're dressing too quickly. He has to feel it by wearing something under too. Put your way to fall

[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.480]
Every time he comes you can see his mask

[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.280]
He's gonna try to wipe it off so now he's gonna try to do the sound

[00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:00.880]
He's gonna try to wipe it off so now he's gonna try to see the sound

[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.800]
He's gonna let go of the sound

[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.260]
Uncondu Treasury

[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.660]
Up

[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.320]
So what's the first word that comes to your mind when you hear a think of Dennis Rodman, huh?

[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.360]
Scumbags. I've said it the first word that comes to my mind two words three words one hyphenated low-life nigger

[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.760]
That's what comes to my mind. I'll tell you who else calls that category Bobby Brown

[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.380]
And his charming wife don't call me Ray Whitney Houston

[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.500]
Low-life scumbags. We got to have we got to start a show better producer show get down on here call America's favorite scumbags

[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.960]
Yeah, America loves scumbags

[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.300]
The lovable scumbags they just never go away. They're always in jail. They're always getting in the fifth fights out in public

[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.680]
They're always a drunken and disorderly

[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.140]
Then he's Rodman by the way crashed you have this party after the event

[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.720]
The big breeders cupping out their Gulfstream

[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.520]
Happier's horse than he said last the horse that's named after him

[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.980]
So yeah, just to show everybody they wasn't in a bad mood. He spent a hundred grand put on a big party

[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.580]
400 females were there by midnight

[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.620]
That he'll he'll monkey around as they know monkey around 50 guys in here with 400 chicks not bad

[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.440]
But the word apparently got out to the all around bad dude Dennis Rodman says Josie land beaten his son for it in starter column

[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.860]
Still reeling from Fridays the rest of the scuffle with occasional wife bitch Kram and electric the tattooed one managed to sneak into heath's party

[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.080]
The aging playboy's personal bodyguards however kept Dennis the medicine is too beautiful us gourds

[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.640]
Well separated from their boss

[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.600]
Heath didn't want to be seen anywhere near him a spy reported

[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.560]
Is not a shock? No, he didn't want to be seen anywhere. They want to be on the same planet with him

[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.820]
Much less in the same room much less photograph with this low-life scumbag

[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.920]
But there are there are certain percentage maybe it's I don't know is it the sports nerds because it's not only sports people

[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.120]
Bobby Brown he is not a sports nerd is it all no?

[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.220]
But there's a certain percentage of the public out there. They're enchanted. They're obsessed

[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.860]
They're in love with these people. I can't get enough of them

[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.580]
The scumma you're the better

[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:47.480]
Dennis Rodman scumma and not only that by the way, but of course that fag routine that he puts on is kind of irretaining to a lot of us as well

[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.960]
Especially those of us fangs

[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.160]
extraordinarily grotesque and irretaining unacceptable

[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.320]
That drag queen

[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.060]
Minsing bull crap whatever that is that he puts on you think it's an act. No, well, whatever it is

[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.460]
Now Bobby Brown's case. I'm sorry

[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.120]
Don't start about Bobby Brown. I wouldn't use it again because we've heard all those stories. Okay. Nobody wants to hear that again

[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.200]
Radiation poisoning do you see that thing on channel seven you didn't see it? I don't want to get you nervous on a Monday right out of the box. Okay

[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.340]
One more great reason not to be here in South Florida two more words turkey. What's the point

[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.100]
They did the thing with kids they did test in Jersey and New York State and also here in South Florida

[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.260]
On how much radiation was in kids teeth. I don't know what kind of people come up with the idea

[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.700]
Let's do a test on kids teeth and see who's got the most radiation

[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.240]
Kids in New York and Jersey that they have like any really amount of radiation in their teeth any no not much barely any

[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.320]
Maybe a little left from Hiroshima and Nagasaki maybe some of the underground testing kind of like leaked in their backyard something like that

[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.380]
But here in South Florida twice the rate

[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.380]
A very dangerous and high and unacceptable rate of radiation in the kids teeth

[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.880]
Which means also of course in our teeth and adults teeth

[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.180]
We're getting radiated. We're getting new to our getting fried

[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.880]
What we are and of course the fp all spokesman comes on here

[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.760]
It says well they've done these things before and it's been debunked by the scientists that were paying off on our side

[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.860]
Etc. That are in so on

[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.600]
There's nothing wrong with a little radiation and in fact all these people that do x-rays all the time doctors love to do x-rays

[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:28.680]
Dennis love to do x-rays because it's very expensive and they make probably like 99 and 9 10th percent on it

[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.160]
Or maybe 2000 percent who they'll notice

[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.300]
And every time you people subject yourself to x-rays you're getting that

[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.740]
Cancer I don't want to get anybody nervous. Okay cancer abundant here in this town not just skin cancer

[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.300]
But all kinds of cancer

[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.560]
Why we're getting mook for getting fried radiation poisoning from nuclear power plants

[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.520]
What when you get nervous? It's in them in what's the point? It's in your food. They're telling you with a food

[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.080]
And the government's worried about cigarettes

[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.140]
The government's worried about getting you to stop smoking because it causes cancer. That's right

[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:13.940]
Radiation poisoning you know who I think has a severe case of radiation poisoning maybe that explains his stupidity George W

[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.040]
There is truly one of the most frighteningly stupid people I have ever seen in my life

[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.160]
Not just that little mini quiz that the gave my believers of the

[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.120]
That general I don't know his name that the guy a guy took over while he was he there was a coup that guy that general

[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.380]
In Pakistan

[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:40.940]
Everybody is that guy well some guy you know some guy he's a moron and he's about 20 points ahead

[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:49.100]
He's gonna be your next president. He is a dumb man. Not just a dangerous man, but he's a dumb dumb man

[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.700]
George W the only reason that he's uh ahead of anybody don't reason that anybody's even considering voting for him

[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.720]
Besides the fact he's got about 60 million dollars in the coffers is because his name is George Bush

[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:05.980]
Oh, yeah, we know that name. He was the president once right? Didn't we uh vote him out in 92? Oh, yeah, he was the president

[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.000]
It's scary. I mean, this is truly a dumb and mean spirit in man too, by the way wise guy

[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.180]
Wise guy not as much of a wise guy is John McCain, but a real wise guy

[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.640]
With an attitude. Well, you guys are always trying to trick me up. Yeah, but I'm not playing that game

[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.920]
You guys some guy, uh, you know, took over over there

[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:33.440]
Yeah, some guy and what's that kind of China? Oh, yeah Lee. I don't know is the Lee can we leave one or hung Lee uh

[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.480]
Whatever his name is mr. Lee

[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:42.660]
And there people actually got a vote for this man. He is stupid. He's a moron. He's dangerous

[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.780]
How about that? What's his name? Damon he was

[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.740]
You mark my words now. They're all gonna be screaming. Okay, Danny. You were great, but hang it up now

[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.700]
We got to we got to champ now, baby. We got a shot

[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.300]
That's right, and we're gonna use it on Danny if you don't retire

[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.280]
Michael male already did today. He did. I didn't see his column. He already said that

[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.600]
Michael hold the male that asshole that who still hasn't apologized any apologizer. They've ever stabbed me at by the way

[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.040]
No

[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.420]
Has got the audacity to say that that marina want to hang it up because this kid managed to fake his way through a couple again

[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.800]
Hey, play pretty good last night

[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.460]
Of course the fact that the ball bounced right back up

[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.900]
It was hands at one time that didn't hurry you're when he got a fumble the ball that didn't hurt either

[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.660]
Hey, played pretty good, but right in the close to show you when everybody in this town. Oh, yeah

[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:32.460]
We got a new hero now. We want a couple of games against girls teams nonetheless, but nevertheless

[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.920]
I'd like to what's that kid's a McNair is that isn't in the quarterback for Tennessee

[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.800]
He couldn't win a high school game this kid. He couldn't win a fixed high school game. That's how embarrassing he is

[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.480]
Oh

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.540]
Yeah, do you see those interceptions I could have caught those

[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.940]
Unbelievable, but that's the NFL for you baby. That's the national football league

[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:58.000]
mediocrity edits finest it's dynamite my favorite game yesterday was the Ravens and the Browns that was

[00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.020]
beautiful

[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.700]
In fact, I might just go home and start watching replays of that all afternoon. I might just leave now

[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.940]
I'm the thing about auto racing unlike golf and I can't stand either one of them but auto

[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.560]
racing at least once in a while somebody gets killed you know whereas golf is I mean

[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.800]
just so boring even the spectators don't get killed like by an air and drive or something

[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.040]
nothing boring but auto racing at least once in a while somebody gets a

[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:07.960]
hit.

[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.660]
Meets his maker and that's what everybody of course is in the wood is waiting for Joe's

[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.260]
got a big smile on his face admitting of course that it can't say it I don't want you

[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.320]

[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:57.500]
read Michael Mayo had a column this morning are you sure how are you?

[00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:02.360]
really positive I think it was in the the other thing in what oh in the dolphins extra

[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.380]
thing well I certainly wouldn't read that because any of the folks pictures on here cured

[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:12.360]
made two big plays says any of the pope silly old man he must have naked pictures I

[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.440]
Hank you know what he's got to have because he's always sucking up there that was from

[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.920]
and Hank knows that he's a silly old man never wrote a column I made since in his life

[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:26.740]
he's a dodging old fool at either pope let's see Michael Mayo writes I'm a

[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.440]
reno the undergo MRI dolphins pay tribute to Walter Peyton he's dead defense could take

[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.720]
dolphins along ways is the silly Greg Kotech I think you're giving me a bunch of crappier

[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:44.760]
is what I think lower left hand side lower left hand side or what well fine huh yeah well

[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:49.360]
not in my paper I read it this morning David oh well first of all this is the herald anyway

[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.460]
oh you know something it's that separate sports section that's the one you're talking

[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.520]
about which I think that's the one I probably didn't bring that's right that's the one

[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:03.340]
I didn't bring you know something in my probably a premonition we'll get you on it's

[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.920]
the separate sun sentinel dolphin thing I figured well one dolphin extra thing is enough

[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.640]
because who they want to talk about that anyway let the sports there talk about that I

[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.060]
don't want to talk about that Michael Mayo you should only croak okay very rarely say

[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.580]
that I'll only say that about you and screw in those are the only two people I would go

[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.700]
and dance on your graves if something horrendous happened to you and maybe it will very soon

[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:29.280]
see a guy to me that calls the show you're in a half ago and lies to me in the audience just

[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.540]
brazenly the way that Michael Mayo did and promises to apologize to Dave Helberstin who eventually

[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:39.120]
did get fired by the heat and well it only is married into a his wife's got a lot of money

[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:45.180]
nice going there David don't be trusted exactly please but you just have no class Mike

[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:51.360]
Mayo you're perfect to this town you're like my good friend Tom jicke you know Tom I know

[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.140]

[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:07.240]
whole thing but I'll get into it in a minute but but you know don't you know that Brooke Daniels

[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:16.460]
isn't on wiod yeah her producer was suspended then fired by wiod 610 for failing to bleep when she

[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:21.400]

[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.520]
number but I mean at least if you're gonna be supposed to be writing about radio TV Tom in a

[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:30.340]
major market god their newspaper in a highly prestigious Sunday book get it right Tom can you do

[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:39.660]
it oh Jesus Christ this town man it's a joke it's a freaking joke what am I getting excited about

[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:43.980]
I'm you know I'm excited about that I can talk this week I probably got because my doctor gave me

[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.960]
some antibiotics nice going doc of course did he take a urine test no no he wanted to take a

[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:53.300]
chest X reinstead did I take the chest X grade no more X raised you people out there unless it's

[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.480]
absolutely necessary they're nooking you they're frying you let me give you kids out there

[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.940]
an example of what happens take something and stick it in the microwave like maybe your cat

[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.260]
and take a look at him after about three minutes on a high take a look at the mess you got in there okay

[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.420]
that's what they're doing to you with this radiation they're nooking us and we can't figure

[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:17.080]
out what is this epidemic of cancer coming from we got liver cancer and colon cancer and we got

[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:22.460]
cancer kidney cancer cancer of every organ that's ever been invented testicular cancer speaking of

[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:30.340]
organ yeah we got cancer up the or we can't figure it out they're killer fri in us I know we don't

[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.540]
want to hear this because it's not a goddamn thing we can do about it we can't go down to a

[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.600]
turkey point and tell them to shut it off because then you'll be sitting in the dark

[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.420]
that's what they're doing they're radiating us to death I just want to go on record to say

[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.680]
that I've for once I believe something I saw on channel seven doesn't happen very often but there's

[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:56.560]
the one time this year here's our facts from Carol at center one our total so far 41,242 bucks after

[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.160]
a very disastrous start I mean there's so many components that that disastrous start between

[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.220]
that the CD is getting screwed up and a golf tournament which are we don't want to mention about

[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:11.880]
oh Jay we eventually will this morning 41,242 dollars and of course you can get your best

[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.940]
of niel CDs and cassettes at all the spec stores all over town and over in four miles on a

[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:20.780]
west coast it's specs and in is it coconuts and napoles I think the guy said yes and of course

[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.720]
will be at the specs in the gables this Saturday noon to two that's on somethings you have a

[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.160]
recross from you of them with all of our stuff including the prestigious buttons what till I do

[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:35.480]
my button every time I bring one of these in here somebody steals it or borrows their bags oh I

[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.340]
got to have on it yeah and then I give it to like Mark Hypnick but at least he paid for a nice

[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:43.100]
go and maybe there's one of the few people he has nothing to do with this show that Mark Hypnick

[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:47.260]
who was a real nerd at IOD but he comes over here and seems like a pretty good guy compared to those

[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:51.640]
losers that we have that mural on the wall over there including that bitch screw in that should only

[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.340]
poke and by the way the shirt you gave me screw in it's sitting over here on a on a cabinet with a

[00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.240]
purple tinky tinky winky with a head supposed to be that's as close as I'm ever going to get to

[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:06.940]
wear an ed thing I wouldn't touch it with your hands phony phony bitch that's still stealing my

[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:12.520]
life spots by the way I you're not fooling anybody screw in but you know something who cares like

[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:17.840]
the old look you weigh in my motto I don't care I don't do whatever you want steal all the spots I

[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:24.020]
don't give a crap Greg Reed is still paying for it what do you care playing games down there again

[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:29.080]
on the second floor and our general manager is walking around with his hand his head very deep in

[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:37.400]
his head he's still can't finger it out God I mean how much self respect can you have when you work

[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.380]
for dumb people you know unless they're paying you a lot of money thank god for that that's the only

[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:46.620]
reason but I can possibly squeeze through so anyway here's a man speaking of the median how accurate

[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:53.020]
they are they had that big weekend of gulps in this only one problem one guy is dead now if you

[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.620]
read the sun sentinel talking about reading certain things in a paper and by the way I don't see

[00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:01.280]
that Michael Mayo column come racing in here from anybody in the building when two thinking a

[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.940]
real radio station somebody come racing in here with that dolphin extra style from the sun sentinel

[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:11.880]
I've never worked anywhere but here oh so like I said you've never seen a real radio station no

[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:19.180]
so in a local section of the sun sentinel here's this article racing devotees fall a track fatal

[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:26.780]
about Jonathan Piri Lane this is the most glowing article he was if you needed help at the track he

[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:31.980]
was your man and what a great guy he was and he was always around to help and people and his family

[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.800]
from Ontario and he grew up near a racetrack as whole biography or what a great guy he was

[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:43.980]
and it's just they're still trying to figure out in the sun sentinel how it is that he fell

[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:49.660]
through this thing and crash landed and the grandstand and the died although with this say there was

[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.580]
some evidence Lane might have been intoxicated when he fell police said but the incident still under

[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:59.040]
investigation that's kind of a throwaway line in there now if you read the herald article on the same

[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:04.740]
story man falls to his death at races police investigate circumstances friend said he spent

[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:11.260]
that a watching the races and drinking alcohol he was drunk said his friend Bruce Jacoubrek whatever

[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:16.060]
to hell his name is a friend and clocker who works for equabase a company that provides race data

[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:21.040]
he was drunk he had been in the bag all day also it says he was wearing a press pass during the NBC

[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:25.580]
logo even though he wasn't in title to have one which gave him access to the press box and most

[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:30.100]
other is the track which is why he was able to go up there into that alcoe like an attic that sandwich

[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:35.560]
between the tracks roof and the grandstand overhang and oops he fell down and oops he's dead so there's

[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:40.920]
exactly the same story for all you people that believe in Jesus and all you people that are worried

[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.320]
about those guys they want to call it with a holes in the hands of the uh what do they call that

[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.440]
i saw the thing about this more what's it even that new movie that's out about the uh come on come on

[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:55.180]
mr catholic mr Italian Catholic what do they call that you know the name i'm looking for

[00:21:55.180 --> 00:22:00.240]
i had a big model that's what it is it just see i have to rely my own sources because you're not a very

[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:05.620]
good brainwash Catholic what the hell is that stig moda what kind of a catholic are you for Christ's

[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:11.180]
good kind yeah stig moda with a holes in the hands it's the the name of that movie so another

[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:16.220]
had got a big saw so if you believe in that crap okay then you'll also believe that somebody's got

[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:21.360]
to write answer on the story but do we know which one no happened Saturday do we really have the

[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:29.920]
uh no see there you go and who killed cock robin by the way 1026 at five sixty wq only one south Florida

[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:36.340]
radio station has the had the door of listening to it and go for weekday afternoon to two sports

[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:45.540]
radio five sixty q a f it theaters now from the director of the six cents it's the eight cents

oh my popcorn tastes like tamila leaves old in plan whoa let me have some

[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.540]
that's thirty one at five sixty wq i'm not say you can nitpick i mean you can find fault or find

[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:13.840]
mistakes with anything but it's just amazing that both of our daily newspapers make so many glaring

[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.840]
mistakes not just little teeny tiny mistakes and when you're dealing with millions of words on

[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.920]
the printed page sure there can be a little mistake here the odd mistake here for example

[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:29.120]
michael meos column which uh Eric uh from morland or fax our new our guy our website guy

[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:35.200]
Eric with a great job he factored the thing already and it's uh the date on it says on the internet

[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:40.220]
november 9th 1999 the only problem with that is tomorrow is november 9th that's the only problem

[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.420]
Michael hold the man oh maybe you have a chance to reconsider the column between now and tomorrow

[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.800]
but anyway here's the front page of the sun sentinel here's a picture of Sam Addison three big

[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.780]
interceptions last night like i said my grandma could occur to the three right in his hands

[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:59.580]
and it says it shows him a do a little bit of that the jukin and jyve and niggery stuff that

[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.640]
these guys do when they you know make a big play hey look at me i'm strutting out the nigger but

[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.980]

[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:12.860]
return for a touchdown during the teams right off the tide that did he return any of those

[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:19.520]
interceptions for a touchdown no no no let me say it again he celebrates returning his third

[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:26.140]
quarter interception for a touchdown did he return any score a touchdown no no no no you as

[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:35.060]
holds you at the sun sentinel right on the front page oh god give me strength to continue in

[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:43.280]
this so imperfect pound i mean everybody has false even i once in a great while might do a bad

[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:49.740]
vn that's right but jesus christ i mean you know you're looking for something that's right just once

[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:55.340]
and by the way what about pavel burry and that little pinky finger huh he wanted to play

[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:59.740]
their advanced cover he wanted to play oh yeah and he now know the doctor said now you're

[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.440]
gonna be out a couple of weeks he wanted to play he wanted to get in there and the terry marisa

[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:08.320]
were worried about infection i think you got to be worried about a brain infection terry i think

[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.540]
it runs in your family if you know what i'm saying i i don't know about you but i'm getting a little

[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:17.060]
bit tired of this whole routine i mean i hate to say that but i'm getting a little bit impatient

[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:22.580]
would be the word impatient i mean call it bad luck call it whatever you want but i'm getting a

[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.140]
little bit impatient and you know something you know when the real test is going to come very soon

[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:32.740]
Wednesday night now thursday's an national holiday am i correct about that thursday's veterans day

[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.420]
as he turns around and says that thursday's veterans day it's the eleventh

[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.960]
he used to be used to call it armistice day now it's veterans day because nobody can say what

[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:47.540]
armate can spell it nobody knows what that means armistice day so it's a veterans day and it's

[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:51.880]
an actual holiday so i would assume the kids have off from school on thursday we'll find out

[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.080]
about that from some pain in the ass parent out there but i would assume that's the case

[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.140]
and there are probably a lot of people like people who work for the state and so on it won't be

[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:04.640]
working on through them i know that for a fact so what would be the exclusive going to a great

[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.920]
hockey game wins then at the macarena well let me give you a list of several thousand reasons why

[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:19.700]
anybody know who they are no no anybody care about them no are they like a big draw no and be

[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:24.140]
povelle bruay will not be playing the big black spartan named peter will not be playing

[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:28.760]

[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:50.040]
no seriously i mean what what kind of a a bunch of crappers that somebody writes a little character

[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:56.320]
i think so he takes the not only takes it off the door but he rewrites the memo based on whatever

[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.980]
they told him without my name and now we've got a new if we got a new and improved copy the

[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:05.300]
memo up there in a wall that has taken my name out we will not be waving it kneel it still says

[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.740]

lots someday in our collection of bluffs memos oh my god pussy pussy pussy pussy so here's

[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:22.500]
Michael mayo column thank you Eric by the way kneelwriters dot com is a website off which you

[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.480]
can order all the center one stuff by the way and also see a lot of good stuff and Eric does a great

[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.600]
job and is right on top of things i mean i had barely mentioned the Michael mayo thing and here

[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:34.820]
it's coming over the facts machine life after marino looking good says uh Michael hold the mayo

[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:39.920]
you know Michael mayo he's an asshole but we know that and i'm even gonna waste my time with

[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:46.120]
any of the rest just the last paragraph what all this does is give marino a little margin for error

[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:52.400]
when he returns before the prospect of johnson pulling him if he stumbled seemed like half-baked bluff

[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:59.020]
but now after seeing what we've seen the last month it doesn't seem like heresy or lunacy

[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:07.500]
he's already dancing on his grave he's already just waiting rubbing his hands together waiting for

[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.500]
Danny to go back in there and start fumbling and stumbling and bumbling and throw maybe one bad

[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:16.380]
pass or maybe fart the wrong flavor or something like that all the time to get him out of there he's

[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:21.480]
all he's all he's washed up let's get dead damon in there whatever hell his name is damon you're

[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:26.560]
let's get him in there and by the way it's dated november 9th on here on the internet Michael mayo

[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.760]
in other words uh maybe it's not coming out till tomorrow even though it was in the paper today

[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.380]
maybe he'd like to have overnight to reconsider this uh huh and not put this swill in the paper

[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.960]
it's a girls league anyway what difference does it make it's a girls league you see that

[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.300]
chip shot field world got block green bay in the bears yesterday at the end of the game see when

[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:48.500]
you had the NFL package like that you see the highlights because there are no good games

[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:53.900]
except of course for the ravens and the browns oh that's my favorite what a matchup that was

[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:57.600]
you know something you could go to any sand lot in town and see kids heave it a ball around you

[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:02.140]
know for for free and see better entertainment than that the ravens and the brown

[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.360]
should to say that those are girls teams will be to insult the uh females of america

[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.540]
that it would be a stripe in the place

[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:18.000]
and let's see the uh the Rams and uh not yeah the samueless Rams and Detroit lines that's

[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.880]
your not to be a pretty good game nice going there teach right

[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.800]
out that's her not to be okay but basically you go up and down you're back and forth on all

[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:31.740]
those channels and uh Caroline and Philadelphia remember i was it last week was the eagle game

[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:36.680]
that the dolphin just barely hung on by the uh two weeks ago that just barely barely squeaked on by

[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:41.880]
and the eagles like i said they're not even like a little league team they're not even a little

[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.280]
league team so anyway getting back to wins the night it could be grim come on out to the macarena

[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.700]
because i don't want to be sitting there alone just sucking my thumb okay

[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.760]
but you have to start wondering you panagai eight million dollars

[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:58.740]
he's played eight games so far in fact out of the total number of games that they've played since

[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:03.640]
he's been here the number of total games he's played is very very minimal at best and embarrassing

[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:11.200]
at worst pop love let's get with it let's tape that thing up and uh you know suck it up like a man

[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:15.700]
bob bond scores the winning goal and overtime in nineteen fifty seven in the stand the cup playoffs

[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:22.740]

[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:45.000]
boys and girls and didn't happen the way you think either but nevertheless yeah what's going to

[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.500]
happen if pop else you get a bruised rectum oh six months easy put his ass on the shelf let it heal up

[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:56.620]
we're waiting we're getting impatient pop love we're getting really really impatient all ten of us

[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.460]
real fans out there the rest of the people that show up they don't really care because they don't

[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:05.480]
know who you are anyway all those drunks just like this guy who had a fall through the roof

[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:10.700]

[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:25.720]
he would is no longer on proven he can actually be trusted maybe that makes marinos days a little

[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:30.600]
more uncomfortable says the anxious michael me oh he's an asshole but for the team as a whole the

[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:35.760]
prospect of life without him now seems much more imaginable even dare we say winnable

[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:42.840]
yeah maybe and maybe not anybody think that the uh dolphins would have won that colds game

[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:48.620]
with the heward playing quarterback no no chance out of chance in hell and by the way that was the

[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:53.260]
game where marino got injured in that game on the third downplay where he got just absolutely

[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:58.200]
wall of just creamed and pulled himself back up there and through the touchdown past the winnable

[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:03.280]
the fourth downplay after getting creamed and getting injured unlike certain hockey players that

[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.060]
are making eight million dollars a year they get a broken pinky finger and they're out for another two

[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:17.640]

[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.420]
but uh what did you talk to you about a couple of things uh the first thing about the dolphins

[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:31.220]
with marino anybody who says that is just a pure asshole I'm gonna talk about that because that's

[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:37.640]
the sports geek right so I work at the airport in Miami yes and that's been a one of the ramp

[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:53.620]
did you talk about that no no you get through to pace 25 in the new times I don't have it

[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:58.940]
what about what is it about it's more a cargo craft oh cargo craft yeah it's more you know

[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:03.680]
wrap wrap wrap severing heads and cutting people's hands off and putting them in concrete boxes

[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.480]
mm things like that sounds tasty yeah maybe I'll write in the right drawer my next flight

[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.000]
true I was reading the hell today I didn't know if you get it they had a free spot for club

[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.860]
Madonna in the local section did you get that no he did not like a whole article on club Madonna

[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:22.760]
yeah I'm strippers and so I bet you they had the right information too unlike us they can't

[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:27.020]
if you get the right information in the spot because our sales department blows well you know I mean

[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:30.500]
they only run those uh those stripper ads during the week they don't run it on the God's day

[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.180]
yes they do they don't run it on Sunday they don't run it on Sunday they don't run it on

[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:37.720]
the don't worry I'll have to check yesterday's sport are you sure I'm positive they don't run

[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:43.440]
stripper ads on Sunday when you can't go to a strip you on on Sunday you can't no you can then

[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:48.060]
you better not have sex on Sunday on the Lord's Day you better get with it mister I'll pray for

[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:52.200]
you have a great taste sir I'll pray for you oh I think it's the stigmata oh geez maybe I just

[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.980]
poked my hand with the knife huh maybe that's what happened to Colin Ron maybe that was the stigmata

[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.560]
happened again and it instead on their hand it like was you know God messed up and it happened

[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:06.220]
on their neck instead huh you don't know the stigmata that's the thing where these guys it's

[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:10.400]
happened very rarely in history and only to a couple of like cardinals and I think maybe a couple

[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:17.960]
of Milwaukee Brewers had it too where they get holes in their hand and they start bleeding because

[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:22.100]
that's part of the SNM religion of Christianity you do realize you understand that is the fact that

[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:26.420]
he had to get nailed up there on the cross with nails in the hands ooh sounds real nice

[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:31.620]
and of course then when you drink the wine it's the blood of Jesus the blood of Christ a lot of

[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:39.220]
blood you know human sacrifice animal sacrifice and a lot of blood and so that's what the stigmata

[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:43.260]
is all about and the church as well we look at these things a little skeptically and we have

[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:48.820]
improvement in the ad but I beat but I will but yeah it's a miracle it's like the meriburge and

[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.000]

[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:21.280]
do the thing the way we wanted to with the 800 line and so now we're going to either sprint or one

[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.640]
of those other phone companies to get the service and so they're like going to start all over again

[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.980]
which is just another way of pushing it back before it becomes nationwide pushing it back a week

[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:34.520]
two weeks then of course I'll be on vacation so we push it back again that's the way they operate

[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.600]
here just keep postponing the inevitable because it keeps the bill weighed down

[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:43.980]
here's pop it'll be chill out on the on the show

[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:50.260]
one thing really bothered me I know you don't you get into politics that the

[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:55.940]
was governor bush I wasn't so much that he got your trapped in the questions when he answered

[00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:02.960]
about Pakistan that a general nother off is giving stability to the country I mean that's

[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:08.740]
like saying that's the leaning up to a no over we elected government before this

[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:14.300]
did you know that we're through the media to add a bond and you know and so that's scary that

[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:20.300]
here's a country that has nuclear war doesn't always answer anybody's talking about right and so

[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.100]

[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:26.800]
he got a ponytail or could have been Jeff Crab could have been one of those at the swing club

[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:31.800]
if it was good enough for Bob Green to go there he was the general manager of our radio station

[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:35.220]
it was good enough for him what's wrong with that it's a public place it's open to the public

[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:38.400]

[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:58.660]
there's a small percentage of people who do who do do do they do yeah they're doing they're doing

[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:02.960]

[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:52.740]
in the camera all the stations right yet microsoft is a monopolist yeah and then they were going to let

new Catholic life satisfies your need for Christianity but it doesn't fill you up with a lot of doctrine

[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:29.640]
Catholic life there's no confessions no sermons and no lingering afterlife it's the perfect alternative

[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:34.680]

[01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:49.710]
you are so beautiful going on and they know on people with injuries and what hard right and then

[01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:53.990]
i'm looking in the last shot that they show is Ronnie lot and he's got his hand up on his face and

[01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:58.550]
the first thought i forgot what his injury was and then the second time i look and i remember

[01:05:58.550 --> 01:06:04.070]
that his the end of his pinky is gone he cut the end of his pinky off so he could finish the

[01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:08.790]
super bowl game and here's a hockey player that won't play with it you know broken or whatever

[01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:13.310]
he chopped that baby right off chop it off man i mean i mean that's that's and that's from the

[01:06:13.310 --> 01:06:18.910]
girls league that's not even hockey there's something wrong here man when you see when if you know

[01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:22.830]
anything about hockey you see all these guys that have these incredible injuries and still are

[01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:27.210]
and another part of the problem is this organization is so terrified that they're going to make

[01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:30.410]
a mistake and they're going to put it back in their force and to go back in their will allow them

[01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:34.030]
to go back in their too soon and then he's going to be out for another two months they're terrified

[01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:38.390]
they're petrified and they've been treating him like a china doll ever since today he got here

[01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:42.490]
they must be with an injury like that they're holding them out like it's a groin injury like

[01:06:42.490 --> 01:06:45.850]
i think if i'm paying somebody ten million dollars a year for five years they then will

better put out if they can stand up i don't get it on a maybe he's you know he's used it at talent

[01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:55.530]

With the big city on your chest

[01:08:09.050 --> 01:08:10.510]
And the group tonight

[01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:13.830]
Just a banding girl in the middle of a crowd

[01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:28.590]
Who's with the speed of a gazelle

[01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:30.990]
And the bad guy straight to hell

[01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:33.070]
With a building

[01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:33.730]
For two

[01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:37.430]
You're a cheap girl

[01:08:40.410 --> 01:08:47.790]
With a building

[01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:47.790]

[01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:49.470]
And it calls in that

[01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:50.770]
Zikata yet on its

[01:08:50.770 --> 01:08:51.870]
Helping things

[01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:54.850]
1132 and 560 WQM

[01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:55.810]
That the New York Times

[01:08:55.810 --> 01:08:56.670]
Spot was kind of interesting

[01:08:56.670 --> 01:08:57.930]
You're not really fat

[01:08:57.930 --> 01:09:00.070]
It's just that your self-images got a problem

[01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.670]
Look at what it is

[01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:02.570]
Just think about it and you'll be skinny by midnight

[01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:04.410]
My son looking down here

[01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:05.730]
I'm looking down

[01:09:05.730 --> 01:09:07.830]
Actually a big, big roll of

[01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.590]
Fat

[01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:11.530]
Yeah that's myself

[01:09:11.530 --> 01:09:12.910]
Although I will say this

[01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:15.110]
When I was in Sarasota in 1973

[01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:17.590]
I reached an all-time high 266 pounds

[01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.950]
Yeah

[01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:20.350]
Oh I was just enormous

[01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:21.570]
266

[01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:24.610]
And you know something I never paid any attention

[01:09:24.610 --> 01:09:25.610]
In other words people

[01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:29.490]
I don't know if it was just me or maybe all really, really enormous obese people

[01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:32.290]
They just are oblivious to it

[01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:36.630]
And maybe when we get older like more in recent years

[01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:37.750]
I look at me and I go

[01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:40.370]
Oh yeah, Jesus Christ

[01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:41.530]
Yeah

[01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:43.790]
In the morning you have to step out of the shower

[01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:45.110]
Start naked as a jabird

[01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:47.370]
And you're looking at me and you go

[01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:48.290]
AHHHHH

[01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:51.030]
But I guess back in those days

[01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:52.370]
Maybe I just didn't have a big mirror

[01:09:52.930 --> 01:09:55.010]
That's a good idea for all you fat people out there

[01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:57.750]
Just don't have a big mirror in the back room or anyplace else

[01:09:58.150 --> 01:09:59.050]
Do you like Dracula?

[01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:00.030]
Just break all the mirrors

[01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:02.630]
Yeah somebody hands you a mirror

[01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:04.170]
Just smash it, say oh no

[01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:06.730]
Not for me, I can't have a thing

[01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:09.230]
It's called a pupic, a big gigantic

[01:10:09.230 --> 01:10:10.290]
It must be

[01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:12.490]
Because I see some of these people who

[01:10:12.490 --> 01:10:14.410]
I mean just candy they waddle

[01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:15.690]
They can barely even move

[01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:17.790]
You know the ones I'm talking about

[01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:19.450]
Like at the hockey games

[01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:23.910]
And you wonder how in the world could anybody get a huge fat ass like that

[01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:26.010]
In one of those teeny little skinny seats

[01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:29.790]
Maybe they just have a self-immons problem

[01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:31.890]
If they were just sitting think about, meditate

[01:10:32.690 --> 01:10:34.070]
We'll find out at Producer Night

[01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:36.170]
Here's Fort Myers, hello

[01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:38.790]
Fort Myers

[01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:41.410]
Yeah, hi Neil, hi, I can tell you

[01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:41.990]
Okay, sir

[01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:43.930]
Hey listen, I'm a fat guy and believe me

[01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:46.170]
I got no mirrors in my house

[01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:46.750]
Good, my house

[01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:49.990]
First of all

[01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:52.930]
Yes

[01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:55.710]
Yes, sir

[01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:56.970]
Oh, okay

[01:10:57.970 --> 01:10:58.830]
Never mind

[01:11:00.610 --> 01:11:01.130]
Bye

[01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:11.150]
So it was on the floor

[01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:15.550]
I'm on my hands and knees ready to

[01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:18.190]
Say a prayer ready to rub my rosary beads

[01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:21.190]
Ready to do a stigmata on my wrist

[01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:23.290]
On the palm of my hands

[01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:27.070]
It's going to be like this again this week

[01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:31.010]
It's part of that birthday celebrate

[01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:32.690]
It's part of that ongoing yearly thing

[01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:34.930]
Like a curse, it's the curse of nails

[01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:35.590]
What it is

[01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:38.730]
I told you last week and it's the truth every year at this time

[01:11:39.550 --> 01:11:42.190]
It's like a living hell, it's like a walking living and breathing out

[01:11:42.190 --> 01:11:43.970]
This guy calls, we're paying for the line

[01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:46.190]
This is our famous auto-tomel that I screamed

[01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:48.310]
And I howard and I carried on like a lunatic

[01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:50.690]
We're on a year and four Myers for Christ's sake

[01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:52.310]
Plus we got all these people on the internet

[01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:54.190]
But at least for Christ's sake for Fort Myers

[01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:55.430]
And how about Palm Beach

[01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:57.690]
And so here's a guy calls from Fort Myers

[01:11:57.690 --> 01:11:58.950]
He gets on the air like

[01:12:00.670 --> 01:12:01.790]
Oh, never mind

[01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:06.790]
And then

[01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:08.530]
That time

[01:12:10.210 --> 01:12:11.810]
That evil sound

[01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:16.850]
Yeah

[01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:21.710]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8

[01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:22.830]
Like I said before

[01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:25.470]
Today is the 8th when they will be the 10th

[01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:25.990]
It's payday

[01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:28.310]
That's what it's been reduced to

[01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:30.050]
I hate to say that but I'll be very honest with it

[01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:31.390]
That's what it's been reduced to

[01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:35.270]
Because I got news for 23 years of pleading and begging

[01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:38.650]
And whipping people to have an opinion about anything to say something

[01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:39.150]
Anything

[01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:41.910]
It's getting stale man

[01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:43.830]
It's getting old

[01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:47.830]
I'm getting old but not nearly as old as this

[01:12:51.250 --> 01:12:51.650]
NOOOOO

[01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:53.150]
But that was a classic

[01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:55.230]
That was scintillating man

[01:12:55.230 --> 01:12:56.270]
That was special

[01:12:57.310 --> 01:12:58.770]
That's what Fort Myers had to say

[01:12:58.770 --> 01:12:59.850]
What do they have to say today?

[01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:01.610]
Hey Neil, this is Randy West

[01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:04.790]
If you can't tell the difference between me and Ron Jeremy

[01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:06.090]
You should try girls

[01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:08.410]
Yeah, that's what they have to say

[01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:10.830]
Speaking of fat Ron Jeremy

[01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:12.830]
Is there anybody who wants to see Ron Jeremy naked?

[01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:14.650]
No, see I don't understand that whole thing

[01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:18.230]
If he wasn't good buddies with Al Goldstein

[01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:20.090]
He never would have gotten a business in the first place

[01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:20.710]
I'm sure that

[01:13:20.710 --> 01:13:22.690]
Maybe he was like servicing Al

[01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:23.650]
That must have been him

[01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:28.470]
Because why would any person in their right mind want to see somebody who looks like that naked?

[01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:30.450]
Even Randy West has anybody want to see him naked?

[01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:31.270]
No, God forbid

[01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:34.050]
Here's Pompano, hello

[01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:35.490]
Hi Neil, yes sir

[01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:38.830]
I got a great story to worry about crossing in sporting events

[01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:41.630]
A story goes that how it goes so

[01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:45.390]
And I suppose your machine was sitting in the front row at the boxing balls

[01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:48.190]
And if the ring jumps one of these panicked guys

[01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:49.990]
It's down in his hands and knees

[01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:51.590]
Give themselves a big cross

[01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:54.870]
And how it looks at the ice pressure consists of that help

[01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:56.230]
And the ice pressure says

[01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:57.790]
Only if there's a good left hook

[01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:58.510]
Yeah

[01:13:58.510 --> 01:14:00.950]
I thought that was great

[01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:03.010]
How about you?

[01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:05.210]
I thought it was slightly amusing

[01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:07.670]
Yeah, that's about it

[01:14:07.670 --> 01:14:08.530]
Okay, thank you

[01:14:08.530 --> 01:14:12.770]
Okay, 560, 7.0560, Pomp-560 on the AT&T line

[01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:15.010]
And out of town line, including Fort Myers by the way

[01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:16.270]
Where they're loaded today

[01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:17.330]
It's their material

[01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:19.590]
877-785-0

[01:14:21.330 --> 01:14:22.270]
877-785-6345

[01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:24.790]
And we'd be paying for it

[01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:26.690]
Maybe that dial call back

[01:14:26.690 --> 01:14:27.890]
Maybe he'll put you up a little bit

[01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:29.210]
You know, he did call back

[01:14:29.210 --> 01:14:29.830]
What do you say?

[01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:31.850]
He said someone came into the room

[01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:32.950]
Yeah, naked?

[01:14:33.210 --> 01:14:33.350]
Leave

[01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:35.190]
Somebody came into the room and he had a leave

[01:14:39.630 --> 01:14:41.090]
Okay, do we believe that?

[01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:41.470]
No

[01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:43.670]
Here's Miami, hello

[01:14:44.690 --> 01:14:45.250]
Hello

[01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:47.050]
You got stricken with bluff Lindsey disease

[01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:47.630]
Yes, sir?

[01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:49.930]
Yes, why am I here?

[01:14:50.210 --> 01:14:50.930]
Yes, sounds like you

[01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:54.430]
Oh, okay, I haven't met my newspaper today

[01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:55.870]
And I looked at it

[01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:59.170]
And it says on the local section

[01:14:59.170 --> 01:15:02.050]
Juice loves soft food and sunshine

[01:15:02.050 --> 01:15:05.570]
This newspaper is trash

[01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:06.230]
Yeah

[01:15:07.290 --> 01:15:10.310]
Stopping my favorite giveaway for God Fluffing OJ and his kids

[01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:13.250]
They just can't stop beating us over the head with this motoring son of a bitch

[01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:17.550]
Right, and there he is with taking a pose for a photograph

[01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:19.790]
For some mother-lady and his child

[01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:21.290]
And these people love him

[01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:23.090]
You know, I live in Kendall

[01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:25.850]
This guy might just move into my community

[01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:27.670]
And I don't want this to happen

[01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:31.510]
And this is this loose paper here just like just

[01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:33.010]
Just a power gift

[01:15:33.010 --> 01:15:35.210]
Well, don't forget Channel 7 is going to have a mon on it

[01:15:35.210 --> 01:15:37.850]
Inside edition or whatever the hell it is that they're promoting on those spots

[01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:39.010]
They're going to have him on again

[01:15:39.010 --> 01:15:41.230]
We just think, well, not leave us alone with him

[01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:43.630]
He's like a weapon and they keep beating us over the head with him

[01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:45.870]
They keep placing us to pieces with him

[01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:47.350]
It just embarrasses me

[01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:49.690]
It just embarrasses me to live in this community

[01:15:49.690 --> 01:15:53.030]
And to see our newspaper just adore him

[01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:54.730]
And I don't know if you know

[01:15:54.730 --> 01:15:56.670]
Dr. Sear, it's all over my, like I said before

[01:15:56.670 --> 01:15:58.430]
It's like Dennis Rodman and Bobby Brown

[01:15:58.430 --> 01:16:00.590]
And it's another scumbag at him to the list

[01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:03.690]
And scumbags that we just can't get enough of

[01:16:03.690 --> 01:16:04.730]
I know

[01:16:04.730 --> 01:16:07.670]
And Bob A. Burring is a potato chip

[01:16:07.670 --> 01:16:11.030]
You should sit next to Yenthal Green on the sideline

[01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:13.450]
Okay, thanks. Quit while you're ahead pal

[01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:16.810]
I was yet a Yenthal Green doing by the way

[01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:18.210]
Anybody seeing him play lately? No

[01:16:19.690 --> 01:16:22.550]
5607-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T line

[01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:26.310]
Nice touch down there by the way on an interception arm sorry

[01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:27.890]
Just nitpicking again

[01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:29.710]
This is them that picking this system make a few mistakes

[01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:31.570]
Right there on the front guy damn page

[01:16:31.570 --> 01:16:34.890]
This is 560-UAF

[01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:38.870]
Only one South Florida radio station has the hammer

[01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:40.610]
And you're listening to me

[01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:42.830]
Hey, stupid! Weak day afternoons at two

[01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:45.970]
Sports radio 560-Q-A-L

[01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:47.350]
Hey, hang this up baby

[01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:49.570]
Two from out of time in your life books

[01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:52.390]
It's the how-to book you just can't die without

[01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:55.690]
From the author of how to steal from the collections played and get away with it

[01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:57.770]
It's the latest masterpiece entitled

[01:16:57.770 --> 01:17:01.710]
How to get into heaven even though you are a rotten bastard on earth

[01:17:01.710 --> 01:17:04.830]
Start at chapter 1 with if your escalator is going down

[01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:07.670]
Hop onto the other side and beat up anyone who can play

[01:17:07.670 --> 01:17:11.950]
Later on you learn the top 10 questions asked by Peter at the pearly gates

[01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:13.870]
And how to fool him with your answers

[01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:16.050]
Also included in this gem of a book

[01:17:16.050 --> 01:17:20.210]
Is 20 full page color diagrams on the pressure points of angels

[01:17:20.210 --> 01:17:23.130]
And the most effective way to use the hand as a bonus

[01:17:23.130 --> 01:17:26.510]
You'll get a full-out poster diagram of how to use an angel's wings

[01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:28.710]
It gets him if he starts to give you any crafts

[01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:30.710]
So if you're destined for hell

[01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:33.650]
Would you think you know how to cheat and lie with the best of him?

[01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:38.690]
Perfect your skills with how to get into heaven even though you were a rotten bastard on earth

[01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:40.850]
Your 12th chapter tickets to bliss

[01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:44.630]
And look for how to sleep with your best friends really hot life coming soon

[01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:46.630]
From 46 and 560-Q-A-L

[01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:48.970]
Many calls today about that stigma, and I want to talk about

[01:17:48.970 --> 01:17:50.530]
Inquiring Catholics want to know

[01:17:50.530 --> 01:17:50.710]
No

[01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:54.890]
Here's the fact that I think tells it all

[01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:56.730]
From Carlos R

[01:17:58.070 --> 01:18:00.070]
Niels, you should have heard the mad dog yesterday

[01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:01.770]
He talked about Pavel Burriolotti

[01:18:01.770 --> 01:18:04.450]
He said the guy should have a D&A test

[01:18:04.450 --> 01:18:07.270]
To see if he's a man or a woman and a lot more

[01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:11.630]
Pavel, you should have a D&A test

[01:18:12.810 --> 01:18:13.870]
Nice going, Carlos

[01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:18.990]
He's like the guy who saw the Titanic victory on the front of the sports

[01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:20.270]
They didn't thought the Titans won

[01:18:21.330 --> 01:18:21.730]
Oops

[01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:24.730]
Little better night school

[01:18:24.730 --> 01:18:26.230]
Little better job there at night school might help

[01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:29.530]
I think I'm going to go to the D&A test

[01:18:30.450 --> 01:18:31.590]
560-Q-A-L

[01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:32.610]
560-Q-A-L

[01:18:32.610 --> 01:18:34.090]
560 on the AT&T line

[01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:37.070]
Here's Pember Pine, tell him

[01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.730]
Niels

[01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:41.570]
Your first person to talk about the stigma

[01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:45.610]
There is on Channel 7

[01:18:45.610 --> 01:18:49.210]
Going to be a whole story

[01:18:49.210 --> 01:18:49.550]
We don't know

[01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:55.430]
Rick Sance is probably foaming the mouth waiting to tell about that

[01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:56.610]
Or whoever is going to do it

[01:18:57.210 --> 01:18:59.370]
Can I be the one to poke the holes in his hands though please?

[01:18:59.790 --> 01:19:00.190]
Sure

[01:19:00.810 --> 01:19:01.250]
Sure

[01:19:02.290 --> 01:19:03.950]
Make it like Swiss cheese if you like

[01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:08.310]
But they're going to do the story on Channel 7

[01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:10.930]
It's going to be the night I believe

[01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:13.590]
Just for information

[01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:16.890]
You might want to catch it

[01:19:20.910 --> 01:19:23.150]
I thought he was going to explain this to you

[01:19:23.150 --> 01:19:24.470]
Tell us what it was all about

[01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:25.270]
And all these fairy tales

[01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:26.130]
Was he going to do that?

[01:19:26.130 --> 01:19:27.590]
No, we'll just wait for Channel 7

[01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:32.770]
See, I don't understand this scheme that we plan to show

[01:19:32.770 --> 01:19:34.710]
Day after day after day

[01:19:34.710 --> 01:19:36.450]
Month after month after month

[01:19:36.450 --> 01:19:38.210]
Year after year after year

[01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:40.490]
Don't you think that's a reasonable question to ask

[01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:42.890]
Especially all the Hispanics out there all Catholic

[01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:46.330]
And you are even a Catholic

[01:19:46.330 --> 01:19:47.730]
Like you didn't know what the hell it was

[01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:50.550]
And they have been a big thing about it now for whatever reason

[01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:51.670]
It's making a big comeback

[01:19:51.670 --> 01:19:53.930]
Maybe there are a bunch of people with bloody hands out there

[01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:55.490]
Like especially the people of the Vatican

[01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:56.910]
They got a lot of blood on their hands

[01:19:59.110 --> 01:20:00.250]
Very reasonable question

[01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:01.170]
Do I get a response?

[01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:03.310]
No, 23 years I've been doing that

[01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:05.390]
And then that one woman calls me

[01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:08.410]
Oh yes, there's a lot of very bright people, a lot of good colors on it

[01:20:08.410 --> 01:20:10.030]
Well, I got news for you, they've all vanished

[01:20:10.690 --> 01:20:11.690]
They've all vanished

[01:20:11.690 --> 01:20:14.910]
Except for Carlos R, who's not getting a DNA test right now

[01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:15.970]
And a guy in four Myers

[01:20:15.970 --> 01:20:17.170]
That was a good call

[01:20:18.210 --> 01:20:19.590]
Well somebody came in the room

[01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:21.670]
Yes, somebody came in the room

[01:20:21.670 --> 01:20:23.330]
And he probably was too embarrassed to let them fight

[01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:24.570]
He was calling on his show

[01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:25.810]
That's probably what the problem was

[01:20:25.810 --> 01:20:27.070]
Because he's over in four Myers

[01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:29.190]
And they probably give him a little stig mod

[01:20:29.190 --> 01:20:31.250]
Right on the hand and maybe on the head

[01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:34.750]
Calling that fag in Miami from four Myers over there

[01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:37.170]
So we appreciate the position you're in, sir

[01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:38.010]
Probably prone

[01:20:40.090 --> 01:20:41.170]
Here's a mobile in Miami

[01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:41.490]
Hello

[01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:43.270]
Okay, sir

[01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:46.330]
I went to the game last night

[01:20:47.850 --> 01:20:49.910]
After the dolphin scored the second touch

[01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:52.170]
And I decided to go downstairs and get something to drink

[01:20:53.150 --> 01:20:55.190]
And then before that I wanted to be

[01:20:55.190 --> 01:20:56.390]
Line to the restroom

[01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:59.310]
Or to proceed to the pop-up pimple on my ass

[01:20:59.310 --> 01:21:01.190]
Got pus all over my jeans

[01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:02.070]
Okay, great

[01:21:03.310 --> 01:21:06.170]
567-0560, 05-560 on the 18th line

[01:21:06.170 --> 01:21:07.870]
Here's a mobile in the pepper fine

[01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:08.190]
Hello

[01:21:08.190 --> 01:21:10.930]
Hello Neil? Yes, hey, buddy, how are you doing today?

[01:21:10.930 --> 01:21:11.330]
Okay

[01:21:11.890 --> 01:21:13.590]
I started with the right after I leave

[01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:15.510]
Caller said about going to strip clubs again

[01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:18.950]
I don't think Ken Jenny's going to have time to be writing them

[01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:20.890]
Because apparently on the news of the night

[01:21:20.890 --> 01:21:23.510]
He's considered running for the strong mayor in Breark County

[01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:26.390]
I didn't hear any of your callers mentioning that

[01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:27.370]
I thought maybe that would be okay

[01:21:27.370 --> 01:21:28.210]
That's mentioning what?

[01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:32.690]
That's not news I talked about that two months ago

[01:21:32.690 --> 01:21:34.450]
I mean that's what he's wanted

[01:21:34.450 --> 01:21:37.350]
Months ago I talked more than two, three, four months ago

[01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:39.210]
Yeah, it's time to pack up and move then

[01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:41.590]
He hasn't got a chance in hell

[01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:44.210]
All the early polls he isn't going to win it

[01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:47.610]
That's what I think he's been doing all the time

[01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:48.110]
All that's pandering

[01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:50.630]
You think he's going to be the Rudy Giuliani of Breark County

[01:21:50.630 --> 01:21:52.790]
And the public is saying you can get the hell out of here

[01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:54.790]
You both had a geek, we don't want any part of you

[01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:56.410]
He's pasty face, look at him

[01:21:56.410 --> 01:21:57.370]
Look at him

[01:21:58.590 --> 01:22:00.950]
Oh my god, he's terrible

[01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:04.250]
Along with the

[01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:06.190]
Permanent sports

[01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.590]
Hello

[01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:10.150]
I'm listening sir, I know it's shocking

[01:22:10.150 --> 01:22:10.910]
I'm still here

[01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:13.990]
Oh you're still there, I'm sorry, I knew I usually get some static in it

[01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.870]
I didn't hear anything of it

[01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:17.150]
I'm still here sir, I'm right here

[01:22:17.150 --> 01:22:19.690]
One that rhymes with boring, how about boring

[01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:21.770]
That's about terminal

[01:22:24.190 --> 01:22:27.990]
5,670560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:29.990]
As we continue the search

[01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:33.290]
The 23 year search ongoing

[01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:36.710]
Somebody out there, somebody with something to say

[01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:41.550]
Something worthwhile, something interesting, something amusing, something perplexing

[01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:44.590]
Something profound, something anything

[01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:47.590]
Something like, eehhhhh

[01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.870]
That

[01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:51.230]
Here's candle, hello

[01:22:51.230 --> 01:22:53.030]
Yes Neil, yes sir

[01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:56.550]
This woman says, give me some proof on who killed her

[01:22:57.290 --> 01:22:58.490]
Woman posing with OJ

[01:22:59.130 --> 01:22:59.750]
Yeah

[01:22:59.750 --> 01:23:03.450]
I don't think OJ is the problem, I think it's all these got people and people like this woman

[01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:06.890]
What does that mean, give me some proof on who killed her?

[01:23:07.090 --> 01:23:09.030]
Well evidently she must have missed a trial I guess

[01:23:09.650 --> 01:23:11.970]
I mean she's a witness to D&A evidence

[01:23:11.970 --> 01:23:13.310]
She's probably a Jesus freak

[01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:15.250]
She's a proof for that though

[01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:19.790]
Okay thanks, 5,670560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:22.930]
Here's Orlando, hello

[01:23:24.210 --> 01:23:25.570]
Hello Neil, yes sir

[01:23:25.570 --> 01:23:28.370]
Yeah let's hope I get through this call, I have a couple questions

[01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:30.270]
There are some other brings up lots of air lines

[01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:32.550]
I gotta talk about it

[01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:36.450]
The gentleman I called earlier with the information on national airlines

[01:23:37.330 --> 01:23:42.210]
Are they gonna be just out of Miami or do you know they're already flying out of some other markets

[01:23:42.210 --> 01:23:43.150]
I don't know where

[01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:46.410]
I just went to Vegas the 1st of August

[01:23:46.410 --> 01:23:49.550]
And I'm about to tell my children you're talking about first class

[01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:52.870]
Because I've never had the opportunity to ride in that

[01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:54.990]
Is it that expensive to go first class?

[01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:57.930]
Well you're like on the line to the high?

[01:23:58.330 --> 01:23:59.050]
$2,500

[01:23:59.050 --> 01:24:00.470]
In American, yeah

[01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:02.090]
Early crap

[01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:04.950]
I believe in the guy just if you were listening

[01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:07.270]
The guy said it was like 280 I think in coach

[01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:09.610]
And 1100 and something in the first class

[01:24:09.610 --> 01:24:10.510]
Well right now

[01:24:10.510 --> 01:24:13.270]
It's a lot of money but it's less than half what American wants to soak it

[01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:16.930]
Right now out of Orlando they have all the airlines

[01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:18.190]
Delta America West

[01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:20.790]
I think Americans in there too

[01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:23.930]
It's like round trip is 212

[01:24:24.530 --> 01:24:25.830]
In 12th of August

[01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:26.650]
In coach Hill

[01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:27.210]
Yeah

[01:24:28.410 --> 01:24:30.850]
We went and got a package deal

[01:24:30.850 --> 01:24:35.270]
You don't like doing the all-in-one air inclusive thing to you

[01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.570]
No

[01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:39.610]
Wife and I both went and paid 972

[01:24:39.610 --> 01:24:42.350]
Spade 6 days of my car when it was round trip air

[01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:43.390]
There's America West

[01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:44.810]
It wasn't really bad

[01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:48.450]
I wouldn't do America West if they paid me $1,000

[01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:49.970]
I would not fly in an airliner

[01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:51.270]
There is no way in Hill

[01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:53.210]
I'll ever fly in America West again

[01:24:54.130 --> 01:24:56.210]
Don't you have an air bus out of Miami?

[01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:57.850]
Is that what the plane is?

[01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:58.370]
They use that other

[01:24:58.370 --> 01:25:00.310]
Well they do now they never use those before

[01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:01.910]
They're now using the air bus but they still

[01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:04.310]
I just keep you in one horror story after another

[01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:06.570]
I hear no good stories about America West

[01:25:06.570 --> 01:25:08.170]
Well I've been Vegas twice

[01:25:08.170 --> 01:25:09.750]
One Delta, one's America West

[01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:12.270]
And believe it or not, America West was better for me anyway

[01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:12.570]
Yeah

[01:25:13.290 --> 01:25:17.690]
Next question is how close can I get the Orlando to pick up one of your CDs?

[01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:19.370]
Palm Beach?

[01:25:19.630 --> 01:25:20.710]
Yeah Palm Beach, West Palm

[01:25:20.710 --> 01:25:21.750]
Oh boy

[01:25:23.730 --> 01:25:26.490]
Or you can just order it off the website

[01:25:26.490 --> 01:25:29.170]
They'll mail it out to you just nearogies.com if you have a computer

[01:25:29.170 --> 01:25:29.970]

[01:25:30.570 --> 01:25:31.830]
I have a super radio

[01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:35.310]
George Haffing when I came on was I listed on the net or the radio

[01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:36.910]
So I do your birthday

[01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:38.570]
I was working in Katsumi

[01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:40.490]
And I have my super radio and I was picking up

[01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:41.310]
He's good there

[01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:43.650]

877785 Neal

[01:25:55.770 --> 01:25:56.330]
877785

[01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:58.070]
6345

[01:25:58.070 --> 01:26:00.290]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale

[01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:00.570]
Hello

[01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:04.150]
Neal, we're living in the SPIC model

[01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:06.070]
Yeah

[01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:08.270]
Yeah

[01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:09.690]
Yeah

[01:26:09.690 --> 01:26:09.690]

[01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:15.370]
Here's a mobile in Davy, hello

[01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:16.510]
Neal, yes sir

[01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:18.210]
Hey this is Josh call from Davy

[01:26:18.210 --> 01:26:20.050]
I just want a little information on the SPIC model

[01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:23.050]
If you don't wonder if you ever heard of Padre Pio

[01:26:23.050 --> 01:26:26.170]
Yes, they had a piece on him again this morning

[01:26:26.170 --> 01:26:28.470]
Yeah, he's not sticking it anymore

[01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:29.890]
They stuck him in the ground

[01:26:29.890 --> 01:26:32.070]
Actually the truth of SPIC model is

[01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:33.510]
They don't stick it through their hands

[01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:34.850]
They stick it through the wrist

[01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:36.730]
That's how the Romans actually cruised the part of him

[01:26:36.730 --> 01:26:37.370]
Through the wrist

[01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:38.130]
Through the wrist

[01:26:38.130 --> 01:26:39.810]
Maybe that's why he had such a limp wrist

[01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:40.710]
Yeah

[01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:43.010]
Thanks for the good news

[01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:45.050]
Also one through the hand to his through the wrist

[01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:46.150]
How do you like that?

[01:26:47.410 --> 01:26:47.770]
Yeah

[01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:50.170]
And of course if he was through the wrist

[01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:51.410]
And that makes all these other stories

[01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:52.470]
Spony, baloney all together

[01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:54.730]
Because Padre Pio

[01:26:55.470 --> 01:26:57.730]
He had holes in the middle of his hands

[01:26:57.730 --> 01:26:59.150]
And he would wear the gloves

[01:26:59.150 --> 01:27:01.230]
And the bandages when he would do the things

[01:27:01.230 --> 01:27:02.110]
Simply go to Mass

[01:27:02.110 --> 01:27:03.830]
And then he would like to take them off

[01:27:04.410 --> 01:27:05.630]
And the bandages too

[01:27:07.290 --> 01:27:08.990]
And to you everybody his bloody hands

[01:27:09.550 --> 01:27:11.270]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60

[01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:12.650]
You never heard of Padre Pio

[01:27:12.650 --> 01:27:13.690]
Padre Pio, whatever, whatever

[01:27:13.690 --> 01:27:15.390]
What kind of a Catholic are you man?

[01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:16.870]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

[01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:18.570]
You got to burn in hell is what you're going to do

[01:27:18.570 --> 01:27:19.650]
I'll tell you that right now

[01:27:19.650 --> 01:27:20.870]
I'll apologize that yeah I'm like

[01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:23.450]
You're going to be burning in hell with those auto racing people

[01:27:24.490 --> 01:27:28.370]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the AT&T line

[01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:30.750]
Has anybody really told us what it is?

[01:27:30.850 --> 01:27:31.810]
Digmata? No

[01:27:31.810 --> 01:27:31.890]
No

[01:27:32.630 --> 01:27:34.650]
But hey we'll just milk it for a couple more hours

[01:27:35.890 --> 01:27:37.950]
877-785 Neil on the out of town line

[01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:41.550]
877-785-6345

[01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:43.530]
Here's a mobile in deer field

Hello

[01:27:45.630 --> 01:27:46.810]
Mobile in deer field

[01:27:46.810 --> 01:27:48.010]

So what's up with that? I was going to literally just summon our speakers to the pulpit volume

[01:27:55.930 --> 01:27:58.570]
How you doing first time call one time listen

[01:27:58.570 --> 01:27:58.950]
Oh? Okay

Yeah, you get me a message for you

[01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:03.530]
Yeah, I got a message for you, okay pal

[01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:04.670]
Off on Gula

[01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:07.250]
Straight from the Vatican right into your ear

[01:28:09.130 --> 01:28:10.950]
It's 11.56 at QAM

[01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:14.290]
This is 5.60 QAM

[01:28:14.290 --> 01:28:16.470]
Head cap with those the scores

[01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:19.330]
Starting in 10 to the last game in

[01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:23.750]
We've nice only on sports radio 5.60 QAM

[01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:28.250]
W-T-A-N

[01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:31.390]
I'm in the sports party now

[01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:44.210]
Oh

[01:28:44.210 --> 01:28:44.210]

Would

[01:28:44.730 --> 01:28:45.530]
In

[01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:46.230]
Oh

[01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:54.790]
No matter what you do

[01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:55.950]
Yeah

[01:28:55.950 --> 01:29:03.310]
I don't care how hard you try

[01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:11.170]
All you got to do is treat and lie

[01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:17.950]
I'm so tired of our be please

[01:29:18.150 --> 01:29:24.150]
I think that that you can in so pretty

[01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:28.530]
Bradley is an ex-junk

[01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:34.290]
And Ford is just a joke and your w-buzz

[01:29:34.290 --> 01:29:38.030]
And the 80s knowing some crap

[01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:42.150]
I would invite for you

[01:29:44.230 --> 01:29:50.310]
No matter what you do

[01:29:51.650 --> 01:29:58.310]
I don't care how hard you try

[01:29:59.670 --> 01:30:05.530]
All you got to do is treat and lie

[01:30:05.530 --> 01:30:06.930]
The first one is 50

[01:30:06.930 --> 01:30:09.330]
I finally have my first year is

[01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:11.970]
I finally answered the question of

[01:30:11.970 --> 01:30:14.350]
And wondering why people in the state don't care about education

[01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:16.730]
They don't want their kids to be smarter than they are

[01:30:18.190 --> 01:30:19.210]
Excellent point Niel

[01:30:19.210 --> 01:30:20.130]
Thank you

[01:30:20.570 --> 01:30:22.670]
Here's a great letter to the editor in a hurdle this morning

[01:30:22.670 --> 01:30:24.710]
From William Gehlberg in Delray Beach

[01:30:25.210 --> 01:30:27.730]
Los Van Van Protester's mimic regime

[01:30:27.730 --> 01:30:29.350]
They fled is the headline

[01:30:30.110 --> 01:30:31.530]
He sends I'm really in

[01:30:31.530 --> 01:30:34.550]
He sends those Cuban ex-hals in Miami who acted so disgracefully

[01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:36.450]
At the recent Los Van concert

[01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:38.870]
It indicates to me and many others that they're more likely

[01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:41.550]
The spot dictator from whom they fled and used threats

[01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:44.410]
Force and intimidation against people who don't agree with their way of thinking

[01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:47.950]
Didn't they learn anything in this land of freedom?

[01:30:48.150 --> 01:30:48.330]
No

[01:30:48.330 --> 01:30:51.730]
We tolerate people to disagree with us and we don't try to impose our feelings

[01:30:51.730 --> 01:30:53.810]
Through the use of force and intimidation

[01:30:53.810 --> 01:30:56.390]
In addition they should know that most of us at one time or another

[01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:58.610]
Also fled from this kind of bullying tactic

[01:30:59.090 --> 01:31:01.690]
If these ex-hals can't readily accept our hospitality

[01:31:01.690 --> 01:31:05.170]
Understand that America is not some third world tin horn dictatorship

[01:31:05.170 --> 01:31:07.690]
Then I would strongly suggest they find another country

[01:31:07.690 --> 01:31:10.910]
That would have them to practice their form of bullying and intimidation

[01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:12.250]
Let's hear it for William Gehlberg

[01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:15.410]
I just go on Billy Boy and Delray Beach

[01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:18.690]
And just coincidentally on a friend page of the Herald

[01:31:18.690 --> 01:31:20.850]
Floridian's welcome ad is wearing out

[01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:24.230]
Cutting immigration returning rafters and ending the embargo

[01:31:24.230 --> 01:31:25.290]
Our favorite it says

[01:31:28.130 --> 01:31:34.710]
Do you favor or oppose making legal immigration in the US more difficult in date county 50% in favor of 45% opposed

[01:31:35.290 --> 01:31:40.970]
And the reason for that being just a bare majority of his panic supports opposed making it more difficult

[01:31:40.970 --> 01:31:43.090]
But even many of those said cut the crap

[01:31:43.090 --> 01:31:49.790]
In Broward County however 68% are in favor of making legal immigration more difficult only 26% are opposed

[01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:53.270]
Because in Broward County we don't have quite as many yet

[01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:56.870]
But an abode people yet as they do in date county

[01:31:59.030 --> 01:32:04.410]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line here's Titusville hello

[01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:06.710]

[01:32:18.890 --> 01:32:20.610]

[01:32:24.670 --> 01:32:31.270]
Okay Niel I just I've never called you but I've taken up the time of the query on this issue with this

[01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:35.830]
Radiation and children's teeth and probably everybody else's teeth

[01:32:36.610 --> 01:32:38.850]
I wish you would really get into it

[01:32:38.850 --> 01:32:41.170]
And what do you mean you wish I would really get into it?

[01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:43.010]
What am I gonna bring it up all the time?

[01:32:43.010 --> 01:32:43.910]
I'll never bring it up

Support the body weight so these assholes with stuff in their palms. They're all budget-fakers

[01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:20.970]
How do you like that? There's the proof we need right there like the other guy said the nails were through the palms

[01:41:21.710 --> 01:41:25.150]
Now they're always through the wrist and the ankles to support me

[01:41:25.150 --> 01:41:29.510]
That's what I meant. They were through the wrist. Well, I'm happy. I think the Lord put those words in my mouth

[01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:33.430]
The story is ways. Hey, I just want to throw my two cents. Thank you, sir

[01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:36.410]
God bless you for straightening that out. They put it right through the wrist

[01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:39.790]
That's why Jesus had two lymphrois not just one

[01:41:41.630 --> 01:41:47.050]
And these fakers whether stigma that they come along and they have like this you know spots on her hand like holes in a hand

[01:42:15.130 --> 01:42:17.230]
There there couldn't be anybody listening to this show

[01:42:19.890 --> 01:42:24.170]
No, sir, they must have people that have been working there for years because this has been going on

[01:42:24.170 --> 01:42:29.930]
I'm KAT it went on I can remember very vividly one day sitting in and going through a tirade on the year for like an hour and

[01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:34.090]
Siddler van go and sitting in his office, which is right next to our studio and going oh, I care

I can remember the front page of that that hatchet job that Mark Fisher did on me in a herald where I'm sitting there

[01:42:52.590 --> 01:42:56.850]
With the tears with that glycerin they put in my eyes with a goddamn cobwebs on the phone

[01:42:58.650 --> 01:43:03.910]
Airbnb station I've worked at in this market. It's been 23 years of desperately pushing and squeezing

[01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:05.550]
It's not entertaining to me

[01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:10.310]
But evidently that's what entertains the audience. That's what they want to hear I

[01:43:12.270 --> 01:43:19.490]
Mean bailiff by it. I'm humiliated by it. I'm grossed out by it. I'm nauseated. I'm sick and by it not sick to be sick for lunch, but nevertheless

[01:43:22.590 --> 01:43:26.930]
This is this is a dead place. This is a place where the dead people dwell

[01:43:28.690 --> 01:43:33.730]
You can't complain about the life in South Florida because there isn't any there are no living and breeding people

[01:43:33.730 --> 01:43:39.710]

And then this bitch calls up who thinks that he's got these married that he was cheating on his wife or some damn thing like that

[01:43:53.050 --> 01:43:57.950]
How do you know if he was there with some bimbo that it wasn't his wife sweetheart, but she just couldn't wait to get on here

[01:43:57.950 --> 01:44:00.910]

[01:44:11.370 --> 01:44:17.910]
You're question about the stigmata. Yes, and apparently the stigmata is produced by the faithful

[01:44:18.930 --> 01:44:21.110]
On certain parts of body hands

[01:44:21.110 --> 01:44:26.590]
There couldn't be too many faithful them because it only had a couple of reports throughout history right and

[01:44:28.030 --> 01:44:36.810]
We're Jesus or the band of thorns around the top of the head they produce and on the side of the body where of course

[01:44:36.810 --> 01:44:41.030]
He was punctured by the spear while up on the cross. Oh

[01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:43.710]
And they produce these

[01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:46.510]
Stigmata are we are bleeding on

[01:44:47.090 --> 01:44:49.010]

[01:45:12.990 --> 01:45:17.910]
regularly when she went into a a when she blood wants them up. Yeah, no

[01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:22.630]
When she was devout and praying. Uh-huh. Oh

And the blood comes pouring out of your hand and she had it across her forehead and actually taped it of

[01:45:30.510 --> 01:45:35.510]

[01:45:53.530 --> 01:45:58.850]
This stigmata, but you see the guys were right it was through the wrist and nails were through the wrist because if they put it through the hand

[01:45:58.850 --> 01:46:02.650]
The hand would have it would just slip right down fall on the ground

[01:46:03.390 --> 01:46:05.030]
Fall right off that then cross

[01:46:05.610 --> 01:46:10.850]
But you put it through the wrist now you got to get the wrong support baby unless it's somebody with a real impressed

[01:46:13.130 --> 01:46:20.410]

Here's a lady in four-lawnerdale. Hello. Hi. How are you Neil? Okay

[01:46:26.490 --> 01:46:31.870]
I'm stigmata. It's not supposed to be external bleeding. It's supposed to be internal bleeding

[01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:37.670]
Yeah, which creates marks on your wrist up to your palm and then your

[01:46:38.370 --> 01:46:45.290]
ankles down to your feet and it's not necessarily religious, but I'm sure that people twist it in that direction

[01:46:45.290 --> 01:46:49.250]
It's not religious. It's not necessarily religious. It's also a medical

[01:46:50.090 --> 01:46:54.130]
Problem named stigmata also which creates internal bleeding. So

[01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:56.510]
It's a medical problem

[01:46:58.290 --> 01:47:05.350]
Yeah, it is a medical problem also and that's why like sometimes you see people like you know what blummishes on their faces and stuff right

[01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:08.550]
That's stigmata and then but you know

[01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:13.430]
Like WC fields head on his nose. Okay, all those bulbous veins in his nose like

[01:47:14.050 --> 01:47:20.110]
Okay, yeah, but um these are legit people twist it into whatever they want to make these suckers believe you know

[01:47:20.110 --> 01:47:23.430]
That they're it's enough to get the Lord yeah exactly

[01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:24.790]
So that's stigmata

[01:47:25.850 --> 01:47:31.850]
Thanks you're welcome. Yeah, there you go. There's what stigmata is it's a goddamn medical condition here. I thought it was burrow clothes veins

[01:47:33.170 --> 01:47:36.910]
From your Nc. Say from your knee down your ankle something like that hip bone joint

[01:47:37.670 --> 01:47:44.050]
Connected to the whatever bone the big bone. That's what Jeff Cohen said hip bone is connected to my big five six seven oh five sixty

[01:47:44.050 --> 01:47:50.150]
Palm five sixty on the AT&T world of sign just just a thought of him being there. I mean why would anybody

[01:47:50.930 --> 01:47:55.730]
That's seriously. I mean, I'm just picking him as an example. Why would anybody want to see him doing anything sexual

[01:47:55.730 --> 01:47:59.010]
You know, I mean I sure wouldn't want to see him in the kitchen at the pizza lot

[01:47:59.010 --> 01:48:04.210]
But the idea of seeing him involved in any kind of a sexual is just I mean see I'm doing everything in my power

[01:48:04.210 --> 01:48:05.550]
So they don't eat too much lunch

[01:48:06.850 --> 01:48:08.090]
nauseating puke inducing

Is gone. Okay, let's try a mobile in the deer field. Hello

[01:48:20.150 --> 01:48:25.430]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Uh, I don't believe in my I think it's all you know a little crap

[01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:28.130]
But the people caught up on Roman execution

[01:48:28.130 --> 01:48:34.150]
Roman crucified in several different ways. Some they didn't even nail you at all. They just tied your elbows

[01:48:34.150 --> 01:48:38.290]
But it wasn't an account of for Romans to nail your palms entire elbows both

[01:48:38.290 --> 01:48:43.250]
So it is possible maybe that Christ was nailed in the palms or not, but you know

[01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:47.350]
I could be on things with the CC. No, I sound like a bunch of bull to me

[01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:48.350]
Mm-hmm

[01:48:48.810 --> 01:48:53.230]
And I suppose there's race Catholic, but I really know it sounds like that old black magic to me all over again

[01:48:53.230 --> 01:48:56.150]
Yeah, I know you're right. Yeah, the Bible's full of a lot of sex and violence

[01:48:56.150 --> 01:48:58.510]
So it's pretty good reading if you look at his entertainment

[01:48:59.870 --> 01:49:03.170]
Okay, all right. Thanks for the good news. Thanks you

[01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:07.650]
Oh my god, it's another act of God

[01:49:08.130 --> 01:49:11.690]
How do you like that? Do you hear that? I need never line punched up and it was like a dial tone

[01:49:11.690 --> 01:49:12.650]

That's what we needed this whole county's and exorcism baby trust me believe me

[01:49:18.230 --> 01:49:23.450]

[01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:11.130]
Yes, sir. I would describe stigmata as a ghoulish Catholic parlor trick

[01:50:11.710 --> 01:50:15.670]
Yeah, and when the Catholic religion is loaded with these kinds of things like

[01:50:15.670 --> 01:50:17.150]
Your transubstantiation

[01:50:17.810 --> 01:50:23.410]
The belief that the a host in the wine turns into the flesh and blood essentially that it's a cannibalism

[01:50:24.030 --> 01:50:28.830]
It's just a it's a lot of it of course it's cannibalism and that business about to give the way for out your eating Christ

[01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:31.410]
I mean what the hell is that and really really believe it is

[01:50:31.410 --> 01:50:35.010]
I mean the hardcore capric to really believe that is in fact the flash of Jesus Christ

[01:50:35.710 --> 01:50:39.250]
And did you know about that when they canonized saints they actually

[01:50:39.850 --> 01:50:44.970]
Exume their corpses and then cut them up in little pieces and turn them into relics. All right

[01:50:45.670 --> 01:50:48.370]
So you know if you believe in the saints you're gonna walk around a little

[01:50:49.070 --> 01:50:53.030]
Crucifix about your really sick bastards to me man. I would have to agree

[01:50:53.490 --> 01:51:01.150]

Would you shoot it in the marino thing?

[01:59:59.810 --> 02:00:00.850]

[02:00:00.850 --> 02:00:01.110]
So you get

[02:00:01.110 --> 02:00:02.010]
Sir what are you saying?

[02:00:02.290 --> 02:00:03.490]
What I'm saying is this

[02:00:03.490 --> 02:00:07.570]
When is everybody going to realize that mind me we're not winning the big old marino

[02:00:08.170 --> 02:00:08.570]
Yeah

[02:00:08.570 --> 02:00:13.350]
Because the bottom line of it is he's not normal he cannot escape he can't get out

[02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:16.570]

[02:00:33.850 --> 02:00:38.570]
The which way do you want to let me ask you something do you have any idea how to use that phone that you got there?

[02:00:39.810 --> 02:00:40.570]
No first line

[02:00:43.650 --> 02:00:44.010]
I

[02:00:44.010 --> 02:00:49.290]
Say could you do you understand what the hell he's saying? I mean didn't you think maybe a new little question for kick make maybe

[02:00:50.190 --> 02:00:53.110]
He wants to know why you don't think Dan marino can win the big one

[02:00:54.410 --> 02:00:58.730]
Whoever said that I'm not the one that said that asshole. I'm not the one that said that

[02:00:59.430 --> 02:01:03.250]
That's all these other front-running phonies. Okay. I went to a couple of ball games right away

[02:01:03.250 --> 02:01:08.110]
He's the new hero and they're ready to throw Dan marino into god then garbage even to the dumpster because that's the way this town is

[02:01:08.110 --> 02:01:09.150]
It's always been that way

[02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:16.150]
In addition which I'm not talking about Dan marino. Okay. I'm sick and tired of hearing about freaking Dan marino

[02:01:16.150 --> 02:01:21.670]
I'm sick of it. I'm tired of it. Danny and Jimmy and Jimmy and Danny and Damien and Jimmy and Danny

[02:01:22.730 --> 02:01:24.790]
It's bearing it's terminal

[02:01:26.430 --> 02:01:33.130]
And the national football league blows anyway. So what's the big deal to begin with? It's garbage. It's swill

[02:01:34.510 --> 02:01:38.110]
They didn't have a linda mari that's a guy nobody talks about if they didn't have a linda mari

[02:01:38.110 --> 02:01:41.610]
How many games for that team is a one this year two

[02:01:42.570 --> 02:01:43.310]
Classmate mine

[02:01:44.070 --> 02:01:51.030]
He was a classmate yours. Yes sir. He's a strange guy. Is it me quiet? He looks like a real Italian Italian

[02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:55.190]
I mean like isn't from Italy. He's he's not Italian. He's uh

[02:01:55.690 --> 02:01:58.970]
He's not Argentine something like that. Oh linda mari

[02:01:58.970 --> 02:02:04.230]
He's not it's not Italian. No get out of here get out of town

[02:02:05.050 --> 02:02:10.330]
Or linda mari with a name like that. What is he Argentinian? Well, you know, there's a lot of Italians in Argentina

[02:02:12.210 --> 02:02:14.790]
So in other words, he's not from Italy, but don't say he's not Italian

[02:02:16.110 --> 02:02:17.130]
South America somewhere

[02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:22.310]
How about you can't you be from South American be a tagine? Are you are you from Italy? No, I'm not

[02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:27.310]
But he doesn't consider himself Italian. What does he consider himself? Whatever South American kind of he's an asshole

[02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:28.890]
I don't know but beside that what does he consider?

[02:02:29.190 --> 02:02:33.830]
But then you know what's that guy to do with where he's from the factors that without him this team would be in a crapper

[02:02:35.070 --> 02:02:38.510]
All they do this guy to empty is kick freaking field goals

[02:02:39.010 --> 02:02:41.770]
Except the course for that great interception return for the touchdown

[02:02:41.770 --> 02:02:45.490]
That's on the front page of the sun sentinel this morning. They never happen except for that

[02:02:52.050 --> 02:02:53.630]

Uh, yeah, I'm calling from Tevniere. I just want to let you know you got a lot of good listeners down here

[02:03:08.490 --> 02:03:11.370]
The lower listeners they let's see all the time and without you

[02:03:11.890 --> 02:03:18.510]
Well, our date would be a mess. Yeah, and uh, well my days and nights today with you guys. How do you like that? It's a mess

[02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:24.290]
When you know, I know, but that's because all the then we age up there in Miami. They're they're sleeping

[02:03:24.730 --> 02:03:31.850]
They don't know so what they got until it's gone. Yeah, and and we love your show and uh, we're gonna let you know that we like your show

Okay, thanks

[02:03:39.590 --> 02:03:40.570]
Yes, sir

[02:03:41.770 --> 02:03:43.790]
Neil yes, oh god

[02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:49.690]
I just sitting there waiting you know I had nine minutes and 41 seconds. That's about the end of the world

[02:03:49.690 --> 02:03:54.510]
That's a short wait. No, I know I didn't have to painting my inside of my house

[02:03:54.510 --> 02:03:57.850]
Yeah, well, I'm sure you'll get back to what eventually. I'm sure you got plenty of time. Wait

[02:03:57.850 --> 02:04:01.650]
I got some information about cruise affections. Yes

[02:04:01.850 --> 02:04:03.790]
Yes, I want to talk about

[02:04:04.410 --> 02:04:05.930]
The method they did it

[02:04:05.930 --> 02:04:10.410]
It was actually suffocation. That's where they hung them upside right

[02:04:11.770 --> 02:04:15.250]
Upside down they died right yeah, I mean

[02:04:15.770 --> 02:04:19.610]
Well, the guy that talked before about put through the rest mm-hmm

[02:04:20.450 --> 02:04:25.890]
That's actually not true. There's actually a bone in your body where you can actually hold your body up

[02:04:25.890 --> 02:04:30.170]
Yeah, and it actually forces the air out of here

[02:04:30.170 --> 02:04:34.530]
They can hold my body up. Yeah, oh, I know that. Yeah, but uh anyways

[02:04:34.530 --> 02:04:39.170]
I don't know if I'm keeping you up. Yeah, your ribcage actually forces all the wind out

[02:04:39.170 --> 02:04:44.390]
It's actually slow method of death. It actually takes about three to four hours. All right

[02:04:45.070 --> 02:04:49.090]
No, that's good anyways. That's good because all of it is your people are either this incident crap

[02:04:49.090 --> 02:04:50.970]
Anyway, it's got to be a lot of pain and a lot of agony

[02:04:50.970 --> 02:04:55.630]
Well, of course god inflicted all this it was all part of his plan anyway. I could totally thank god for that

[02:04:55.630 --> 02:04:57.950]
You can explain it. Yes, I went through

[02:04:57.950 --> 02:05:01.630]
About 17 years with a Catholic education and

[02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:06.250]
God, I don't know what happened to me, you know

[02:05:07.530 --> 02:05:09.270]
That's a good question obviously

[02:05:10.250 --> 02:05:17.990]
And I read about all this stuff, you know, yeah, I know and you know the weird thing about it is I know yeah

[02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:20.330]
They used to hang him upside down

[02:05:21.150 --> 02:05:22.370]
And that make a

[02:05:23.050 --> 02:05:27.330]
Closer death that take about an hour. Yeah, that's what you just said. Okay. Thank you sir

[02:05:27.330 --> 02:05:29.810]

He gave a python the first class and that and there's no information on that as well

[02:08:46.490 --> 02:08:50.950]
Well, I don't you know, I mean, I can't directly from the you know, and so maybe maybe uh

[02:09:57.830 --> 02:10:00.150]
I wouldn't dignify him by putting him on the air. That's why

[02:10:01.370 --> 02:10:04.750]
All right, that's why I just wanted to know because I would get him one second worth of air time

[02:10:04.750 --> 02:10:10.070]
What's the point because I'm some kind of a sadist that I'm gonna get some kind of sexual excitement by calling him a murdering son of a bitch

[02:10:10.070 --> 02:10:12.010]
I can do that without putting him on the air

[02:10:14.330 --> 02:10:14.970]
All right

[02:10:14.970 --> 02:10:22.770]
Now I'm playing with that 100 percent no question about it. So let me say it again. He will not be on this show trust me

[02:10:22.770 --> 02:10:26.030]
You can take it to the bank. Thank you. Can you play with me for girls?

[02:10:28.030 --> 02:10:33.610]
5667 05 60 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's the mobile in Miami. Hello

[02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:41.430]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey Dylan first on I apologize for the fact that Miami is surrounding you by idiot. Oh

[02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:45.990]
There's it's it's reached the epidemic now. It's like an epidemic situation we got

[02:10:46.630 --> 02:10:49.850]
I've been listening to you recently. I um, I've been out here for a couple of years

[02:10:49.850 --> 02:10:54.330]
I did my postgraduate work and now I'm staying because my fiance is gonna go buy and get her my asterisk

[02:10:54.330 --> 02:10:58.290]
And although I'm thinking really soon moving back to America and

[02:10:58.990 --> 02:11:00.450]
I was I was

[02:11:01.130 --> 02:11:04.770]
Was one day I person stuff you talk about education before I've been around town

[02:11:04.770 --> 02:11:07.150]
I teach now at a local college which I'm not gonna name

[02:11:07.690 --> 02:11:12.590]
But I have these people I go into restaurants and you know, I've applied for teaching jobs

[02:11:12.590 --> 02:11:15.370]
I teach music so I was gonna teach for this thing

[02:11:15.370 --> 02:11:20.230]
You go to houses and teach kids and instruments and then they told me my Spanish wasn't good enough and broken English

[02:11:20.230 --> 02:11:21.010]
Which was real nice

[02:11:21.610 --> 02:11:22.010]
and

[02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:25.330]
You know I hear people talking about the dolphins

[02:11:25.330 --> 02:11:28.990]
I'm not a sports fan and I but you know but I can if you're in this voice

[02:11:28.990 --> 02:11:33.350]
I know you're in the hockey. I hear that you know and although these fans are a piece of crap down here anyway

[02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:36.130]
For whatever they're listening to music sports doesn't matter

[02:11:36.130 --> 02:11:41.990]
But at the same time these people talk about a bunch of crap on the radio worrying about what they're gonna go to a club

[02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:44.110]
Why Miami isn't winning why?

[02:11:44.450 --> 02:11:50.750]
Why marinos doing this and the same time I teach your college to get a bunch of papers in from these same kids that are talking a bunch of this crap

[02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:56.210]
Yeah, and they can't even string four sentences together. Mm-hmm. You know, I do anything with a d and a test

[02:11:57.130 --> 02:11:58.410]
I don't know what it is

[02:11:58.410 --> 02:12:01.410]
But these these people want a bunch of morons. I mean I

[02:12:01.410 --> 02:12:03.490]
You got it. You got it

[02:12:03.850 --> 02:12:07.210]
It's really yeah, I could take it personally if I wanted to but I'm not an idiot

[02:12:07.210 --> 02:12:10.110]
You know, I got a pretty good sense of humor. I got an IQ large and then my thumbnail

[02:12:10.110 --> 02:12:15.110]
And I'm just surrounded in the town where the average IQ is in a minus column. That's all nothing I can do about it

[02:12:15.110 --> 02:12:16.750]
I can do the best I can that's it

[02:12:16.750 --> 02:12:20.830]
I enjoy listening to you Neil your your highly intelligent individual and

[02:12:20.830 --> 02:12:25.530]
And I have a great time listening. I'm taking Wednesday's payday just to take the event

[02:12:25.530 --> 02:12:29.950]
Have a great day. Take care of it. That's right Wednesday's the 10th of November. It's another payday

[02:12:30.510 --> 02:12:35.370]
The only reason I'm here. God bless me. God bless America four minutes to one of QAM

[02:12:35.950 --> 02:12:42.230]

He's gonna win the race

[02:13:27.310 --> 02:13:30.870]
People of him call me if I'm now

[02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:37.290]
Did I mention that he is now

[02:13:37.290 --> 02:13:37.690]

He played for the next

[02:13:43.690 --> 02:13:45.070]
He doesn't bar up

[02:13:46.970 --> 02:13:50.710]
Yeah, we love him cause he is now good

[02:13:54.890 --> 02:13:56.890]
Not our goal

[02:13:58.170 --> 02:14:00.510]
Not our goal

[02:14:01.370 --> 02:14:02.830]
Not our goal

[02:14:03.370 --> 02:14:04.930]
Yeah, he's not our goal

[02:14:04.930 --> 02:14:08.390]
I say it one time more

[02:14:09.630 --> 02:14:11.570]
We love feel a lot

[02:14:12.870 --> 02:14:15.790]
But because he's not boring

[02:14:15.790 --> 02:14:17.910]
out the door

[02:14:19.190 --> 02:14:21.250]
Well, don't you love feel Bradley?

[02:14:21.790 --> 02:14:25.010]
Well, it's still at 560 that's still empty. It's just so easy

[02:14:25.010 --> 02:14:29.770]
See this is what happens when you got in the tanny. It was an auto racing like Mario and Dredy

[02:14:29.770 --> 02:14:33.350]
Okay, he knows nothing else. He probably don't even know no past of his rule

[02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:37.410]
No, seriously, you don't know anything about Italy. You don't know anything about

[02:14:38.670 --> 02:14:41.830]
Catholicism all you know is auto racing and a goddamn Yankees

[02:14:42.510 --> 02:14:44.710]
Which congratulations, but I've never left. Thank you

[02:14:45.470 --> 02:14:48.430]
No, seriously, I learned the marri how could anybody say is not a tanny?

[02:14:49.070 --> 02:14:52.550]
I mean, I'm embarrassed for you. I mean, it would be one thing if you were like Polish

[02:14:53.450 --> 02:14:54.670]
But you're a tagging

[02:14:55.750 --> 02:15:00.090]
Yeah, and he's a tanny don't be like my son. Oh Miltonborough wasn't Jewish

[02:15:00.590 --> 02:15:07.510]
Or isn't or whatever the hell he is. He's still alive. He's not what Jewish Miltonborough. Yeah. Okay. Miltonborough's not Jewish and

[02:15:07.510 --> 02:15:10.490]
Maryland or was not dead and

[02:15:10.490 --> 02:15:14.070]
Ronald Reagan doesn't have Alzheimer's and anti-region doesn't wear red dress

[02:15:15.210 --> 02:15:18.950]
In fact, Nancy Reagan is the devil with a blue dress on how do you like that

[02:15:19.530 --> 02:15:24.670]
Or is that Monica one of the other? He's a titan god damn it. I had heard some

[02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:29.790]
Her what you see this is what happens when you start spreading bad rumors

[02:15:29.790 --> 02:15:33.990]
He's a dingo. He's a wap. He's a guinea okay. He's a satan

[02:15:33.990 --> 02:15:35.310]
He's a good guy

[02:15:35.310 --> 02:15:42.090]
He's and nobody in this audience all these sports nerds on his radio who call his god damn stupid as sports station

[02:15:42.650 --> 02:15:44.970]
Danny this and Damon that and Jimmy this

[02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:48.730]
There's the only reason that they're even in the goddamn running much less leading to the vision

[02:15:49.930 --> 02:15:50.970]
Isolendo Marre

[02:15:51.770 --> 02:15:54.650]
Olendo Marre yeah, there's the guy right there that little wap

[02:15:56.410 --> 02:15:59.210]
Yeah, he's scored 95% of their points already

[02:16:00.150 --> 02:16:03.470]
Besides that one great return for the interception and touchdown last night

[02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:07.130]
Didn't he run it all away? No, no

[02:16:10.630 --> 02:16:12.410]
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello

[02:16:12.410 --> 02:16:17.450]
No, how you doing? Okay, sir. You got a great show. Let me just tell you. I moved here from LA a few months ago

[02:16:17.450 --> 02:16:19.630]
And listen talk shows a long time. Yeah

[02:16:20.170 --> 02:16:24.970]
Even if you didn't have one call it would be a fantastic show. There's something everybody all over the world

[02:16:24.970 --> 02:16:29.470]
Are you to come down here and oh you're the greatest thing we ever heard in our lives other people in a business

[02:16:29.470 --> 02:16:34.330]
And yet every day of my life here is like the first day that I'm on a year in his town

[02:16:34.330 --> 02:16:37.390]
These are the most ungiving unyielding

[02:16:37.390 --> 02:16:42.950]
Unbending goddamn people they will give you nothing and all they want is you to give them something for free

[02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:45.070]
That's all they want. They're about your freeloaders

[02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:48.870]
I think first of all just to tell it like it is. I mean you're just hilarious

[02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:50.270]
I enjoy it every day

[02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:55.630]
But here's my main point and I thank you for bringing a pocket because nobody talks about that

[02:16:55.630 --> 02:17:00.150]
They wouldn't know a hockey puck from a goddamn lenders bagel. I've been a fanatic for 32 years

[02:17:00.150 --> 02:17:04.950]
Let me guide you some might I watch this team burry's not the thing people just not talking about burry

[02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:10.190]
This team has a bunch of primitonis with the exception maybe five guys that hit anybody

[02:17:10.190 --> 02:17:16.250]
Yeah, you guys got six five guys like Kajla Kavashia Mike Wilson these guys could go into the court

[02:17:16.250 --> 02:17:20.470]
They could go into the corner with an egg in their pocket and it wouldn't come out the cracked it all

[02:17:20.470 --> 02:17:25.590]
That's right. It's a fan of pristine these guys think they're the players on his team right now

[02:17:25.590 --> 02:17:29.250]
Okay, Ray Whitney you got Mark Parrish you got

[02:17:30.250 --> 02:17:31.050]
Trevor kid

[02:17:31.630 --> 02:17:35.630]
You got right ahead of him when he's not suspended and I'm trying to think of somebody else

[02:17:35.630 --> 02:17:36.670]
Paul laws

[02:17:36.670 --> 02:17:38.990]
That's about it. Simpson and melon behind him

[02:17:38.990 --> 02:17:41.390]
Mel Melon be what he's head straight now

[02:17:41.390 --> 02:17:47.790]
And you know what wins and hockey is not the fancy dance that the ice to page you need hard work and teams

[02:17:47.790 --> 02:17:53.510]
And this team until I get rid of a lot of these free low. There's like a devora actor wouldn't touch anybody

[02:17:53.510 --> 02:17:58.390]
Yeah, there's another stuff. I mean, this is pathetic. So it's not burry burry when he's in that's fine

[02:17:58.390 --> 02:18:04.350]
But you're missing is this point and that is this for example Atlanta's gonna be our Wednesday and expansion team a

[02:18:04.350 --> 02:18:09.610]
Test team nobody here knows the Atlanta thrashers from the the trash man. Okay, they have no idea

[02:18:09.610 --> 02:18:12.270]
So if you're gonna try to get people to come out

[02:18:12.270 --> 02:18:17.810]
You've got a guy that's making ten million dollars a year who for my money is still the most exciting not the best player

[02:18:17.810 --> 02:18:21.230]
That's still the auger but the most exciting player in the world when he's healthy

[02:18:21.230 --> 02:18:22.930]
But he's got to get healthy sometime

[02:18:23.550 --> 02:18:28.770]
You know I agree with that but you know what the thing that really brings people out is a winning hard work and team

[02:18:28.770 --> 02:18:31.490]
And you know when I go to these games if you lose you lose

[02:18:31.490 --> 02:18:36.250]
But I want to go down fighting. I want to be a hard working when I saw that game Saturday night with no

[02:18:36.250 --> 02:18:40.930]
Visellte I wouldn't wouldn't drop his gloves with somebody and no one be has to get a game is kind of yeah

[02:18:40.930 --> 02:18:45.030]
But they won the game six to three. I mean they won the game. They won the game. Yeah, but they girls team now

[02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:48.870]
I understand that but they got too many guys on this team that they're not character type guys

[02:18:48.870 --> 02:18:53.910]
Yeah, and until that changes this team is gonna stay average at best and I just want to say that

[02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:58.850]
It's not buried it's these other players that won't put out that's the problem. Yeah

[02:18:58.850 --> 02:19:03.030]
There's nothing worse than a guy that won't put out. Yeah, you know have a great day. Thanks. They all like that

[02:19:03.650 --> 02:19:05.290]
Let's get hockey intensive baby

[02:19:05.290 --> 02:19:06.410]
And i just wanted to try my course on basketballtime

[02:19:09.130 --> 02:19:10.250]

[02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:29.750]
Theetriour dominat Houor playing under the board of blue

[02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:30.030]

[02:19:33.070 --> 02:19:35.710]
i realize your bone eight no jigs michael

[02:19:35.710 --> 02:19:39.950]
but he still makes the here rise on the back of my head i'll tell you that

[02:19:40.950 --> 02:19:44.790]
that's one of the problems we got in here is these radio broadcast i'm sorry

[02:19:44.790 --> 02:19:49.090]
five six seven o five sixty pound five sixty on the eighteen t-line

[02:19:50.950 --> 02:19:55.270]
things that are meaningful things that are important like hockey these people

[02:19:55.270 --> 02:19:58.150]
don't know from they don't care about it they don't want to learn about it

[02:19:58.150 --> 02:19:59.090]
they know nothing

[02:20:00.770 --> 02:20:04.890]
the status day of my life was the day that i gave those guys and tickets away

[02:20:22.750 --> 02:20:23.310]
it herself

[02:20:24.530 --> 02:20:26.470]
maybe she even prescribed to it

[02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:30.890]
i think this town needs a d and a test is what i think

[02:20:33.270 --> 02:20:37.510]
she's got a read out of the god them uh... roosters in a hockey news to be able

[02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:40.450]
to win a ticket but at least like i said she came in admitted to me in public

[02:22:25.830 --> 02:22:29.670]
because maybe texas will score a few runs with those goddamn tigers never did

[02:22:31.070 --> 02:22:33.330]
but you ever hear just in to us and to come some speak

[02:22:33.930 --> 02:22:38.630]

[02:22:39.410 --> 02:22:42.490]

[02:22:42.490 --> 02:22:47.930]

and you want to listen to it go over weekday afternoon to two sports radio five sixty

[02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:57.310]
q a f so we're short radio i've heard my livin on w out

[02:22:57.310 --> 02:22:59.990]
one time i said the record straight like that

[02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:03.710]
when you're doing some people seem there

[02:23:03.710 --> 02:23:10.090]
no desire to judge if he gets drugs back then so what's the point

[02:23:10.090 --> 02:23:12.970]
because as a candidate

[02:23:12.970 --> 02:23:17.050]
George Bush is fine so uh if he

[02:23:17.050 --> 02:23:19.390]
he's not that aligned

[02:23:19.390 --> 02:23:19.990]
oh right

[02:23:19.990 --> 02:23:24.090]
well he's the best damn candidate i've seen

[02:23:25.050 --> 02:23:28.650]
i don't care if he's a fat amaz

[02:23:29.450 --> 02:23:33.530]
the president quit and was a digging mine

[02:23:34.090 --> 02:23:37.810]
so he's to Bush he did i

[02:23:39.050 --> 02:23:41.530]
play if i just don't understand what they do

[02:23:42.650 --> 02:23:44.790]
we've had many presidents of the office

[02:23:45.450 --> 02:23:47.730]
who does harm to bring her another

[02:23:49.130 --> 02:23:50.970]
thank you all for for instance

[02:23:51.870 --> 02:23:53.690]
obviously he was on the phone

[02:23:53.690 --> 02:23:56.490]
otherwise why would you call him down all the time

[02:23:57.270 --> 02:23:59.590]
and take Jimmy Carter for example

[02:23:59.590 --> 02:24:02.630]
but he was so hopped up on scultman

[02:24:03.290 --> 02:24:06.230]
he didn't even know there were other just for the first eight months

[02:24:07.290 --> 02:24:09.410]
why even more Mike don't watch it

[02:24:09.410 --> 02:24:14.750]
but i do believe the only reason i jumped down the cherry tree was because he had the

[02:24:20.330 --> 02:24:21.010]
juice

[02:24:21.010 --> 02:24:25.230]

That's too late. It's already gone. Hey listen

That's a full place, you know, it's all going crazy

[02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:08.190]
What are we gonna have for a president?

[02:28:08.930 --> 02:28:10.730]
Here's Santa Bell. Hello

[02:28:10.730 --> 02:28:18.630]
Hello, yes, sir. Neil. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm an expatriate American who lives in Italy and I'm just visiting here. All right and

[02:28:18.630 --> 02:28:23.770]
I just wanted to make a few times. I apologize for these dependency of our Americans but nevertheless

[02:28:23.770 --> 02:28:28.690]
Well, I came back here after a couple you know seven or eight years and I can't believe the changes I've seen

[02:28:28.690 --> 02:28:31.250]
Yeah, it's just it's like a

[02:28:32.830 --> 02:28:34.430]
vapid torped but now

[02:28:35.350 --> 02:28:42.750]
Existence of commercial nothingness right exactly. I mean, I've never seen anything quite this bad, but I mean Europeans

[02:28:44.450 --> 02:28:46.070]
You know, they understand it

[02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:52.430]
Yeah, it seems to me that Americans don't see the force for the trees. They don't I I keep telling them that I keep telling them how

[02:28:52.430 --> 02:28:58.670]
Civilized it is in Europe and how the people are right around shooting each other and nobody has guns and there's no this rampant violence and the people are

[02:28:58.690 --> 02:29:03.650]
Educated and like in some of the countries people speak five and six and seven languages fluently and they're you know

[02:29:03.650 --> 02:29:07.690]
Priorities education and how many material things that they've got and these people go

[02:29:08.630 --> 02:29:14.150]
Like that they just don't care their brain washed well, you know, I mean after living you know

[02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:16.690]
when you live in places like Florence right and

[02:29:17.590 --> 02:29:22.310]
Rome being on the V evento correct. I mean what more can you ask for?

[02:29:22.450 --> 02:29:24.910]
I mean you got people that are like you said civilized

[02:29:24.910 --> 02:29:28.530]
Yeah, there's enough to make you want to go back to the Colosseum and you know and

[02:29:28.690 --> 02:29:33.210]
Storse some Christian to the lions. Hey, listen. I got a little answer for you as far as big motto

[02:29:33.210 --> 02:29:36.750]
Yeah, have you ever been to Tuscany? I'm sure you have yes

[02:29:36.750 --> 02:29:42.930]
There's a little area that you got to get to it's up near a little town called a raco, which is where my relatives are from

[02:29:42.930 --> 02:29:48.050]
Arrezzo Arrezzo. It's about 40 miles west of Florence and South

[02:29:48.050 --> 02:29:49.690]
40 miles west of Florence

[02:29:50.270 --> 02:29:52.750]
Florida. Yeah, 40 miles west and south

[02:29:52.750 --> 02:29:58.270]
Right, Florence. Now if you go above there in the Ampeneins, which is just you know awesome territory

[02:29:58.970 --> 02:30:03.830]
Much prettier than Florida. I ate this but it ate it but it's all of Italy's pretty unbelievable

[02:30:04.590 --> 02:30:08.350]
And anyways, there's a little area. There's a little monastery called La Verna

[02:30:08.930 --> 02:30:14.190]
And also one called Commaldoli. Now that's where St. Francis had his quote unquote

[02:30:14.190 --> 02:30:17.390]
Stigmata. St. Francis of Assisi. Yeah, right. The same

[02:30:17.390 --> 02:30:19.650]
St. Francis of Assisi anyways

[02:30:19.650 --> 02:30:23.190]
So the deal is that if you're about to become a saint

[02:30:23.790 --> 02:30:25.230]
you go down to some little

[02:30:26.610 --> 02:30:27.530]
Yeah, seller

[02:30:28.810 --> 02:30:32.190]
Whatever and they shoot you with this you know Star Trek deal

[02:30:33.290 --> 02:30:36.750]
And you wanted to know what it was about and that what it is. Yeah, they put the tomato

[02:30:36.750 --> 02:30:37.330]
They put the

[02:30:37.790 --> 02:30:39.670]
A pommador sauce on your hands

[02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:43.090]
Yeah, and it's kind of like you come on. I'm bleeding. I'm bleeding. It's an act of

[02:30:43.630 --> 02:30:47.470]
An act of something they're like Jim Kirk. I start trekking right exactly

[02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:52.370]
Just like that. Hey have a good one. Thanks a lot pal. You bet. I'll leave it there to you

[02:30:55.230 --> 02:30:55.470]
Oh

[02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:06.250]
123 a QA and five six seven oh five fifty. Here's an incredible story and this story by the way, I especially want to dedicate

[02:31:07.150 --> 02:31:12.190]
To all those bony red wing fans out there who show up at the macarena every time the red wings coming at time

[02:31:12.190 --> 02:31:16.050]
With their red wings jerseys on people that wouldn't know south field from north field

[02:31:16.850 --> 02:31:19.510]
People that never were on god damn 12 of a 12th street

[02:31:21.330 --> 02:31:24.390]
People that wouldn't know the ambassador bridge from the ambassador to England

[02:31:26.490 --> 02:31:29.990]
Members of a Florida television crusade red wings coach Scotty Bowman

[02:31:29.990 --> 02:31:35.510]
Captain Steve izerman and forward Marpanne La Point abuse them during a game in Tampa Bay last night

[02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:36.830]
Nice going lightning by the way

[02:31:36.830 --> 02:31:38.010]
I watched that game

[02:31:38.790 --> 02:31:40.690]
Which detroit lost three to two

[02:31:41.910 --> 02:31:46.850]
The detroit free press reports today that Bowman shoved the cameraman into a stage manager in the old obscenities

[02:31:47.350 --> 02:31:47.790]
izerman

[02:31:48.290 --> 02:31:53.230]
Try to grab a camera during the third period of the wings three to two lost on the net and La Point threatened and spit

[02:31:53.230 --> 02:31:54.710]
How do you like that for class?

[02:31:54.850 --> 02:31:55.970]
I spit at the cameraman

[02:31:57.870 --> 02:32:03.530]
The trouble began during the second animation after the defenseman Chris Celios was penalized when 10 seconds left in the period

[02:32:03.530 --> 02:32:05.630]
Giving Tampa Bay a two-man advantage

[02:32:06.210 --> 02:32:12.350]
Bowman left the bench walked down the tunnel tour the locker room and encountered a camera crew that was sitting up the interview associate coach Dave Lewis

[02:32:13.310 --> 02:32:19.930]
Bowman allegedly pushed cameraman Richard Delaney who fell in the stage manager Amy Confort the camera striking her on a shoulder

[02:32:19.930 --> 02:32:20.570]
loss

[02:32:22.090 --> 02:32:25.510]
Delaney said Bowman just shoved me out of the way, but he didn't want to come in further

[02:32:26.130 --> 02:32:29.030]
Act whether he was in Bowman's path. Delaney said I could have been

[02:32:29.750 --> 02:32:32.170]
Confort said she was angry and planned to file a complaint

[02:32:32.730 --> 02:32:33.090]
also

[02:32:34.510 --> 02:32:38.470]
We were just trying to do our job trying to interview one of the assistant coaches during the period breaks

[02:32:38.470 --> 02:32:42.450]
She said he did it with enough force to feel the impact then he started yelling obscenities

[02:32:42.450 --> 02:32:44.410]
He wasn't a real happy person at that point

[02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:47.910]
Lewis left the arena before reporters learned of the allegations

[02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:53.630]
The trouble continued into the third period after the lightning scored twice to take a three to one lead at 201

[02:32:53.630 --> 02:32:58.030]
But Rocky said he pointed his camera at isemen and LePont sitting dejectedly on the bench

[02:32:59.350 --> 02:33:04.570]
But Rocky was and at an assigned station between the benches shielded from players by plexiglass

[02:33:05.150 --> 02:33:10.850]
Isemen reached him on the front of the glass to try to grab the lens and I backed up at Rocky said when I backed up

[02:33:10.850 --> 02:33:13.210]
Isemen backed off and LePont started on me

[02:33:13.210 --> 02:33:17.710]
But Rocky told the newspaper that LePont threaded him saying I'm coming over the glass

[02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:18.450]
Squirt Squirt

[02:33:18.970 --> 02:33:22.370]
So the next thing I know the truck he said he did his spitting routine

[02:33:24.330 --> 02:33:28.410]
He was arching his spitting over the glass to try to get at me

[02:33:32.930 --> 02:33:38.790]
Nice classy job there Scotty Bowman and Stevie Y and Martana point nice going

[02:33:39.650 --> 02:33:43.750]
Of course, you'd be pretty pissed off too if you lost to a girl's team in Tampa last night three to two lecture red wings

[02:33:43.830 --> 02:33:50.390]
So all you phoneies all you're front running phoneies that go there suck at the red wings ass every time to come to town take that and stick it right in your

[02:33:54.090 --> 02:33:55.130]

[02:33:57.050 --> 02:34:02.130]
Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, no, I don't okay sir. Just wondering if you saw the article on the Sun sent me yesterday

[02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:06.390]
I know charity is lately. I've been a touchy subject with you about the

[02:34:06.850 --> 02:34:11.010]
Denise Brown charity set up for Nicole Simpson. I talked about that brother woman

[02:34:11.010 --> 02:34:15.630]
Oh, did you okay? And they raise all this money and about two dollars is gone and do what the real charity?

[02:34:15.810 --> 02:34:19.470]
Yeah, I just it really opened my eyes a lot to what these charities are all about

[02:34:19.470 --> 02:34:24.210]
I mean, you know administrative fees. What does that mean you basically live off the charity the rest of your life in their pocket

[02:34:24.210 --> 02:34:29.850]
That's right. Okay, buddy. Okay, so check it in with it. Thanks for the goodness. Okay, five six seven oh five sixty

[02:34:35.670 --> 02:34:36.330]
How do you like that?

[02:34:40.090 --> 02:34:40.670]

[02:35:15.450 --> 02:35:20.590]
Unfortunately, I speak like I had a stroke first blood came in 82

[02:35:20.590 --> 02:35:23.650]
That's when I heard my penis and it never ever grew

[02:35:23.650 --> 02:35:29.130]
Rambo two was in 85 late and rainbow three was in 88

[02:35:31.130 --> 02:35:31.730]
Brothers

[02:35:31.730 --> 02:35:31.730]

[02:35:31.730 --> 02:35:31.730]

[02:35:31.730 --> 02:35:35.010]
I did not make this movie with my sons

[02:35:35.930 --> 02:35:36.650]
Never-s Since

[02:35:36.650 --> 02:35:39.570]

[02:35:53.670 --> 02:35:56.410]
It was still good, so he guess i understand

[02:35:56.410 --> 02:35:58.230]
All life is about aging

[02:35:58.230 --> 02:36:01.430]
Oh, I got left in the center of the flag there.

[02:36:03.410 --> 02:36:07.190]
Ladies and gentlemen, I need to make ramble for it.

[02:36:07.430 --> 02:36:07.630]
Bye.

[02:36:11.970 --> 02:36:12.870]
Check it out.

[02:36:13.050 --> 02:36:14.270]
So call me up.

[02:36:14.530 --> 02:36:15.550]
I really need a script.

[02:36:15.790 --> 02:36:18.270]
I can do dialogue or keep it zip.

[02:36:18.410 --> 02:36:19.190]
I like comedy.

[02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:19.890]
Action.

[02:36:20.110 --> 02:36:21.210]
Adventure and drama.

[02:36:21.510 --> 02:36:23.830]
The only thing I will not do is have sex with a llama.

[02:36:24.270 --> 02:36:26.690]
So give me a break for goodness sake.

[02:36:26.690 --> 02:36:29.450]
I used to be on offer and now I can't get on Ricky Lake.

[02:36:29.710 --> 02:36:32.130]
Right now I got a one man showing, Paul Kipsy.

[02:36:32.390 --> 02:36:34.270]
Basically I'm an unemployed gypsy.

[02:36:34.610 --> 02:36:36.670]
I don't know if it catches what I need.

[02:36:37.230 --> 02:36:39.410]
I got to get alone from the Apollo Queen.

[02:36:39.870 --> 02:36:44.910]
I got to have another movie or Broadway show like Benaheem.

[02:36:45.310 --> 02:36:47.670]
I guess nobody ever saw a top lancer.

[02:36:47.770 --> 02:36:48.770]
It was stupid.

[02:36:49.150 --> 02:36:50.190]
So I understand.

[02:36:51.570 --> 02:36:53.630]
My whole face is about to cave in.

[02:36:54.130 --> 02:36:56.370]
All I get left is Jennifer Clevver.

[02:36:57.570 --> 02:36:58.990]
That's why I'm ready to get on.

[02:36:59.910 --> 02:37:02.630]
I need to make ramble for it.

[02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:05.990]
Absolutely.

[02:37:06.850 --> 02:37:08.370]
Offer 8256 WQM.

[02:37:08.390 --> 02:37:09.390]
I shouldn't be in all this lunch.

[02:37:09.490 --> 02:37:10.350]
You know, all that cheese.

[02:37:10.890 --> 02:37:11.950]
Bad cholesterol, baby.

[02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:13.350]
255.

[02:37:13.470 --> 02:37:16.570]
Oh, LDL and unacceptable 190.

[02:37:16.850 --> 02:37:17.830]
Oh, oh, oh.

[02:37:18.030 --> 02:37:18.190]
Yeah.

[02:37:18.530 --> 02:37:18.930]
Not too good.

[02:37:19.390 --> 02:37:19.950]
Not too good.

[02:37:20.030 --> 02:37:21.290]
Those blood test results last week.

[02:37:21.390 --> 02:37:22.790]
Their cholesterol is sky high.

[02:37:22.910 --> 02:37:23.610]
I think it might have been all that bad.

[02:37:23.610 --> 02:37:23.610]

[02:37:23.610 --> 02:37:23.610]

[02:37:23.610 --> 02:37:23.610]

[02:37:23.610 --> 02:37:23.610]

[02:37:23.610 --> 02:37:23.610]

[02:37:23.610 --> 02:37:24.090]
I think it might have been engineering.

[02:37:25.250 --> 02:37:26.590]
All these lunch, meats and cheese.

[02:37:26.910 --> 02:37:27.910]
All that fatty stuff.

[02:37:29.230 --> 02:37:30.530]
See, I was thinking about this the other day.

[02:37:30.810 --> 02:37:34.490]
When you're trying to, first of all, you want to do the addkins or you want to do some low carb diet.

[02:37:34.870 --> 02:37:37.310]
And then you're going to cut out all the sugar and the starches.

[02:37:37.610 --> 02:37:40.470]
And if you're going to also cut out cholesterol, what are you going to eat?

[02:37:41.390 --> 02:37:41.870]
What's left?

[02:37:44.230 --> 02:37:45.410]
What's left to eat, decide?

[02:37:45.610 --> 02:37:46.670]
Yeah, that's about it.

[02:37:48.810 --> 02:37:52.470]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[02:37:52.650 --> 02:37:54.530]
8, 7, 7, 7, 8, 5, Nailed.

[02:37:54.530 --> 02:37:57.050]
I'll figure it will be its specs in the South-Aid and the Gables.

[02:37:57.610 --> 02:37:59.370]
The Saturday noon to 2 with our best of stuff.

[02:38:01.470 --> 02:38:02.790]
Here's a mobile in the Helenvale.

[02:38:02.790 --> 02:38:03.090]
Hello.

[02:38:03.770 --> 02:38:04.750]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[02:38:04.990 --> 02:38:05.370]
Okay, sir.

[02:38:05.890 --> 02:38:08.350]
Hey, listen, you see that thing about the church root cave in it?

[02:38:08.750 --> 02:38:08.950]
Yeah.

[02:38:10.030 --> 02:38:12.130]
You know, the first thing they did after the root cave, yeah?

[02:38:12.390 --> 02:38:13.110]
And what was that, sir?

[02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:14.570]
They wanted to play the God.

[02:38:15.070 --> 02:38:15.290]
Yeah.

[02:38:16.050 --> 02:38:17.030]
You'll got it.

[02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:20.470]
Walker, walkaway's root falls 23 hurt in the Ultimons Springs.

[02:38:20.870 --> 02:38:23.090]
A lot of bad things seem to be happening in church lately, you notice?

[02:38:23.710 --> 02:38:24.890]
Yeah, well, you know, thank God.

[02:38:25.370 --> 02:38:27.190]
Okay, that's what's God's busy with the NFL.

[02:38:27.430 --> 02:38:27.690]
Oh!

[02:38:27.970 --> 02:38:29.490]
That's right, he's busy with those NFL games.

[02:38:29.830 --> 02:38:31.350]
And in fact, you noticed another new thing.

[02:38:31.750 --> 02:38:33.630]
You didn't see the end of the bear's Packers game.

[02:38:33.910 --> 02:38:36.790]
Because the field goal kicker for the bear is to miss the chip shot field goal,

[02:38:36.930 --> 02:38:38.110]
which would have given him a bigger lead.

[02:38:39.150 --> 02:38:42.510]
And so then the kid for the Packers comes out there with a chip shot.

[02:38:42.510 --> 02:38:44.210]
It looks like the bears are going to blow another one.

[02:38:44.470 --> 02:38:45.230]
And the kicker's blocked.

[02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:50.490]
And the kicker for the bear is going like this, and he's looking up at the sky.

[02:38:50.890 --> 02:38:52.130]
And they showed a couple other highlights.

[02:38:52.490 --> 02:38:56.170]
And after these guys make the great catch, or they score the touchdown, they're looking up in the sky.

[02:38:58.790 --> 02:39:01.390]
Like something, maybe a pigeon up there had something to do with it.

[02:39:01.610 --> 02:39:04.370]
What is it up there in the sky that caused them to win the goddamn game?

[02:39:04.650 --> 02:39:06.110]
Did God have something to do with that?

[02:39:08.670 --> 02:39:10.610]
Did God forth that field goal to be blocked?

[02:39:10.770 --> 02:39:11.370]
Is that what it was?

[02:39:12.070 --> 02:39:13.910]
Jesus Christ, they're crossing themselves.

[02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:14.990]
They're looking up at a sky.

[02:39:15.310 --> 02:39:17.510]
Like if there's a God, he's worried about God damn sports.

[02:39:18.690 --> 02:39:20.490]
But God listens to QAN.

[02:39:20.610 --> 02:39:22.490]
The wonder we've had sex bad weather lately.

[02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:23.730]
You know, it must be pretty pissed off.

[02:39:25.650 --> 02:39:30.090]
Hey, God, let me ask you what you're taking on that Sterling Heights nearborn game this weekend.

[02:39:30.610 --> 02:39:30.770]
God.

[02:39:33.350 --> 02:39:37.290]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[02:39:37.290 --> 02:39:40.630]
And 8, 7, 7, 7, 8, 5, kneel on the Florida line.

[02:39:40.630 --> 02:39:41.390]
Boy, I can't wait.

[02:39:41.510 --> 02:39:43.330]
Can't wait for that line to go nationwide, boy.

[02:39:43.870 --> 02:39:44.990]
I bet you we get at least what?

[02:39:45.170 --> 02:39:46.410]
Two, three more call a day on that thing?

[02:39:46.690 --> 02:39:47.430]
It's going to be smoking.

[02:39:49.210 --> 02:39:50.010]
Here's Miami Lakes.

[02:39:50.190 --> 02:39:50.310]
Hello.

[02:39:51.090 --> 02:39:51.150]
Hello.

[02:39:51.450 --> 02:39:51.730]
Yes, sir.

[02:39:52.110 --> 02:39:54.370]
Yeah, how the comment about the pain stored?

[02:39:55.050 --> 02:39:55.410]
Yeah, huh.

[02:39:55.950 --> 02:39:56.850]
Yeah, I got a pain for it.

[02:39:56.970 --> 02:39:57.950]
Chronic, chronic spec.

[02:39:58.350 --> 02:39:59.390]
Chronic, chronic, chronic.

[02:39:59.410 --> 02:40:00.350]
You're boring, pal.

[02:40:00.930 --> 02:40:01.210]
Chronic.

[02:40:02.750 --> 02:40:03.930]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:40:04.030 --> 02:40:04.250]
Hello.

[02:40:04.890 --> 02:40:05.470]
Hey, Neil.

[02:40:05.650 --> 02:40:05.990]
Yes, sir.

[02:40:06.370 --> 02:40:10.090]
You guys over in the sports case, I guess, the sunset.

[02:40:10.090 --> 02:40:11.950]
No, just still running last week's spot.

[02:40:13.030 --> 02:40:13.390]
Yeah.

[02:40:13.490 --> 02:40:14.130]
Yes, sir.

[02:40:14.490 --> 02:40:14.990]
Good guys.

[02:40:15.270 --> 02:40:18.350]
And now he hasn't even finished it, and I can ask him what he's talking about.

[02:40:18.530 --> 02:40:22.050]
He's already got the radio cranked up so he can squeeze himself with his son of his own voice.

[02:40:23.930 --> 02:40:24.890]
Oh, my God.

[02:40:25.030 --> 02:40:26.450]
This is just, it's you know what it is?

[02:40:26.530 --> 02:40:26.970]
Oh, the lake.

[02:40:27.010 --> 02:40:28.750]
That's exactly the word I'm looking for, man.

[02:40:28.790 --> 02:40:29.270]
Thank you.

[02:40:31.430 --> 02:40:35.610]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[02:40:37.250 --> 02:40:38.330]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[02:40:38.470 --> 02:40:38.670]
Hello.

[02:40:40.390 --> 02:40:40.730]
Okay.

[02:40:41.530 --> 02:40:48.490]
So that story about Iserman really sounds a little out of character for him, but I guess you know anything can happen.

[02:40:48.610 --> 02:40:49.770]
You get a guy in a bad minute.

[02:40:50.070 --> 02:40:50.210]
Yeah.

[02:40:50.250 --> 02:40:55.690]
That doesn't sound like really something to do, but what I understand is that he wasn't the main perpetrator.

[02:40:55.930 --> 02:40:58.650]
I mean, I guess the, uh, pushed the lens of the camera got the camera.

[02:40:58.650 --> 02:40:59.370]
Oh, maybe he did.

[02:40:59.670 --> 02:41:02.310]
The first time he saw the game said they really didn't play that well.

[02:41:02.310 --> 02:41:03.970]
So maybe he was the bad guy for him.

[02:41:04.010 --> 02:41:05.450]
How much the game, they didn't play that well.

[02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:06.470]
They didn't play that well.

[02:41:06.470 --> 02:41:07.310]
That's what I grewl's team.

[02:41:07.870 --> 02:41:10.970]
You go in there thinking you can roll over on the next thing, you know, you're down at home.

[02:41:11.270 --> 02:41:12.150]
Well, that is stuff happens.

[02:41:12.310 --> 02:41:12.730]
People lose their heads.

[02:41:12.730 --> 02:41:13.130]
What the heck?

[02:41:13.330 --> 02:41:14.210]
You know, people lose their heads.

[02:41:14.210 --> 02:41:15.110]
They lose their heads.

[02:41:15.170 --> 02:41:15.870]
You're going to lose some games.

[02:41:16.050 --> 02:41:18.050]
That's the excuse for anybody spitting at people.

[02:41:18.550 --> 02:41:18.910]
That's true.

[02:41:19.050 --> 02:41:20.150]
And pushing people down.

[02:41:20.730 --> 02:41:21.510]
That's pressure on us.

[02:41:21.630 --> 02:41:23.350]
It's the ones in the night to beat that new team.

[02:41:23.650 --> 02:41:24.650]
So it should be interesting to see.

[02:41:24.730 --> 02:41:25.830]
You're pressure on us to have 8,000 people.

[02:41:25.830 --> 02:41:25.950]
What do you do?

[02:41:26.010 --> 02:41:26.630]
You're up there.

[02:41:26.710 --> 02:41:27.410]
That's the big pressure.

[02:41:27.770 --> 02:41:29.850]
Well, good luck to us anyway.

[02:41:29.910 --> 02:41:30.350]
Okay, thanks.

[02:41:30.930 --> 02:41:33.050]
There's pressure to see if we can get anybody in that joint.

[02:41:33.050 --> 02:41:36.210]
And based on the tremendous response I'm getting about is Pavel Buria.

[02:41:36.350 --> 02:41:38.930]
Pussy, I don't think we're going to have anybody in that joint wins the night.

[02:41:39.290 --> 02:41:40.190]
And let me say it again.

[02:41:40.430 --> 02:41:41.670]
The kids are out of school on Thursday.

[02:41:42.090 --> 02:41:43.510]
Oh, Jesus, you know what that means?

[02:41:45.090 --> 02:41:46.010]
You know what that means?

[02:41:46.130 --> 02:41:47.870]
You know who's going to be sitting in front of me Wednesday.

[02:41:48.250 --> 02:41:48.810]
Oh, God.

[02:41:48.890 --> 02:41:51.010]
Holding a little kid's up in the air back and forth.

[02:41:51.170 --> 02:41:51.570]
Here's grandpa.

[02:41:51.970 --> 02:41:52.910]
Here's the Oh, Jesus.

[02:41:53.810 --> 02:41:53.950]
Them.

[02:41:54.650 --> 02:41:54.830]
Them.

[02:41:55.270 --> 02:41:55.990]
Whoever they are.

[02:41:56.310 --> 02:41:56.430]
Them.

[02:41:58.470 --> 02:41:59.970]
I don't want to attach a name to them.

[02:42:00.170 --> 02:42:01.190]
All I know is it's them.

[02:42:01.190 --> 02:42:01.390]
Them.

[02:42:02.830 --> 02:42:07.850]
The back and forth people, the up and down people, the ante people, the ante in the pants people.

[02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:10.070]
So let's go get some more goddamn food people.

[02:42:10.590 --> 02:42:10.950]
Them.

[02:42:12.330 --> 02:42:13.090]
They'll be back.

[02:42:14.390 --> 02:42:19.870]
Although it is a pretty crappy opponent, maybe, just maybe they gave those tickets to somebody else.

[02:42:20.070 --> 02:42:23.010]
Yeah, maybe the two guys that came last week who just wanted to stand up the whole time.

[02:42:24.090 --> 02:42:25.250]
Yeah, just stand up.

[02:42:25.890 --> 02:42:26.690]
We'd score a goal.

[02:42:26.970 --> 02:42:27.430]
They'd stand up.

[02:42:27.550 --> 02:42:28.470]
Everybody else would sit down.

[02:42:28.590 --> 02:42:29.310]
They're still standing.

[02:42:29.630 --> 02:42:30.510]
They were singing out in John.

[02:42:30.510 --> 02:42:31.730]
I'm still standing.

[02:42:31.810 --> 02:42:32.950]
Yet they were doing that in the number.

[02:42:33.270 --> 02:42:33.430]
Yeah.

[02:42:33.770 --> 02:42:34.590]
I'm still standing.

[02:42:35.090 --> 02:42:35.850]
Oh no, kidding.

[02:42:35.990 --> 02:42:37.630]
I thought that was your ass in my face.

[02:42:40.090 --> 02:42:40.790]
Here's Bokeh.

[02:42:40.850 --> 02:42:40.970]
Hello.

[02:42:41.550 --> 02:42:42.010]
Hey, Neil.

[02:42:42.210 --> 02:42:42.830]
You ever happy?

[02:42:43.210 --> 02:42:43.690]
All the time.

[02:42:44.050 --> 02:42:44.590]
All the time.

[02:42:44.610 --> 02:42:44.750]
All the time.

[02:42:44.970 --> 02:42:47.010]
What can we do for you, sir?

[02:42:47.250 --> 02:42:49.110]
I just wonder what you don't have any material.

[02:42:49.810 --> 02:42:50.830]
See, that's not a phone call.

[02:42:51.350 --> 02:42:51.910]
You don't like me.

[02:42:52.030 --> 02:42:52.550]
You don't like the show.

[02:42:52.770 --> 02:42:53.150]
See ya.

[02:42:53.310 --> 02:42:53.670]
Bye-bye.

[02:42:54.050 --> 02:42:54.330]
Goodbye.

[02:42:54.910 --> 02:42:55.510]
Have a great life.

[02:42:55.850 --> 02:42:56.350]
So long.

[02:42:59.770 --> 02:43:02.530]
560-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[02:43:03.590 --> 02:43:04.350]
Here's Evan Tura.

[02:43:04.490 --> 02:43:04.610]
Hello.

[02:43:05.550 --> 02:43:06.130]
Hello, Neil.

[02:43:06.390 --> 02:43:06.570]
Yes.

[02:43:07.170 --> 02:43:07.810]
How are you, sir?

[02:43:07.970 --> 02:43:08.210]
Okay.

[02:43:08.770 --> 02:43:09.010]
All right.

[02:43:09.070 --> 02:43:09.550]
I guess he's calling.

[02:43:09.670 --> 02:43:11.190]
I don't know what they're calling.

[02:43:11.490 --> 02:43:11.570]
They're calling.

[02:43:11.850 --> 02:43:13.290]
So they want to take a shot at me.

[02:43:13.450 --> 02:43:14.230]
I'm holding the same.

[02:43:14.730 --> 02:43:15.650]
Well, I'm holding on the line.

[02:43:15.770 --> 02:43:16.250]
I'm hearing them.

[02:43:16.270 --> 02:43:17.210]
And I'm hearing what they're saying.

[02:43:17.350 --> 02:43:17.970]
I mean, you're right.

[02:43:18.070 --> 02:43:19.430]
They have nobody has nothing to say today.

[02:43:20.210 --> 02:43:22.130]
Anyway, what I'm calling for is, um, what's that?

[02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:23.530]
I'm not sure what show it is.

[02:43:23.630 --> 02:43:25.790]
It's that special edition or high-company around seven o'clock.

[02:43:26.390 --> 02:43:26.670]
Evening.

[02:43:26.670 --> 02:43:26.890]
Yeah.

[02:43:27.470 --> 02:43:31.150]
They're going to have one commercial I tune in, a pound 96 there.

[02:43:31.170 --> 02:43:34.170]
I've given a commercial for, uh, every time for OJ Simpson.

[02:43:34.350 --> 02:43:34.610]
I could that.

[02:43:34.650 --> 02:43:35.090]
Now, one more.

[02:43:35.750 --> 02:43:37.410]
You could have the same commercial on this show.

[02:43:37.490 --> 02:43:37.990]
Oh, man.

[02:43:38.230 --> 02:43:38.370]
Yeah.

[02:43:39.850 --> 02:43:42.130]
Well, anyway, uh, he's calling that one one called that.

[02:43:42.170 --> 02:43:43.070]
He made a couple of weeks ago.

[02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:43.350]
Yeah.

[02:43:43.650 --> 02:43:45.390]
Well, they're going to have, uh, they're going to have this, uh, girl.

[02:43:45.410 --> 02:43:45.950]
I know that.

[02:43:46.050 --> 02:43:46.910]
Why are you promoting that?

[02:43:47.310 --> 02:43:47.890]
I didn't know.

[02:43:48.030 --> 02:43:48.970]
I didn't hear you talk about it.

[02:43:49.050 --> 02:43:49.790]
I didn't mention that.

[02:43:49.870 --> 02:43:50.510]
That it's going to be on.

[02:43:50.530 --> 02:43:52.970]
I also mentioned we don't want to talk about OJ and have a great day.

[02:43:53.950 --> 02:43:55.310]
Enough with OJ already.

[02:43:55.850 --> 02:43:57.430]
Enough with a goddamn OJ.

[02:43:58.270 --> 02:43:58.750]
No more.

[02:43:58.870 --> 02:43:59.410]
Oh, man.

[02:44:00.790 --> 02:44:01.150]
Christ.

[02:44:01.870 --> 02:44:02.670]
Here's another guy.

[02:44:02.830 --> 02:44:05.730]
He's, you know, he's putting him down, but on the set the same time he's obsessed.

[02:44:06.170 --> 02:44:06.830]
Can't get enough of it.

[02:44:06.830 --> 02:44:07.370]
He'll be watching.

[02:44:08.810 --> 02:44:09.730]
Do I want to watch?

[02:44:09.970 --> 02:44:10.110]
No.

[02:44:10.210 --> 02:44:10.970]
Not going to be watching?

[02:44:11.050 --> 02:44:11.190]
No.

[02:44:11.310 --> 02:44:11.470]
No.

[02:44:11.790 --> 02:44:12.290]
No, thanks.

[02:44:12.750 --> 02:44:13.290]
El Paso.

[02:44:15.150 --> 02:44:18.810]
560, 705, 60, pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[02:44:20.570 --> 02:44:24.210]
Well, least thank God we learned something important today, Orlando Mares Italian.

[02:44:24.470 --> 02:44:27.150]
I thought I already knew that before I came in here, but at least we verified it.

[02:44:27.210 --> 02:44:27.970]
Okay, let's hear it.

[02:44:28.090 --> 02:44:29.970]
Okay, for a very educational show.

[02:44:30.550 --> 02:44:34.790]
We also learned that Jeff Cohen makes great food at the pizza lot.

[02:44:34.990 --> 02:44:39.710]
And Jeff, when knows the scores, starting at 10 of the last 10 in,

[02:44:40.210 --> 02:44:44.130]
we ignite only on sports radio 560, QAM.

[02:44:44.490 --> 02:44:44.970]
You'll Nicole.

[02:44:45.690 --> 02:44:48.590]
The legendary athlete, the extraordinary actor.

[02:44:48.590 --> 02:44:51.170]
Now, he debuts in his new action series.

[02:44:51.730 --> 02:44:54.550]
OJ Simpson stars in Miami Slides.

[02:44:54.590 --> 02:44:55.090]
J.J.

[02:44:55.390 --> 02:44:55.770]
L.A.S.

[02:44:56.590 --> 02:44:57.830]
Come on, jump the field.

[02:44:58.350 --> 02:44:59.290]
The juice is loose.

[02:44:59.550 --> 02:45:02.370]
OJ Simpson isn't a vast cop named Bruno Mali.

[02:45:02.830 --> 02:45:04.730]
The Viet Street of Brentwood, California,

[02:45:04.890 --> 02:45:07.110]
the deadly streaks of Miami Florida.

[02:45:07.590 --> 02:45:10.610]
Listen to OJ Simpson's ass-kicking top dialogue.

[02:45:11.110 --> 02:45:15.770]
So, where were you's last night at 7 p.m.?

[02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:18.050]
Answer me, bitch.

[02:45:18.410 --> 02:45:19.250]
Bitch, bitch.

[02:45:19.630 --> 02:45:21.250]
The bitch is going to fall.

[02:45:21.670 --> 02:45:21.990]
You're going to fall.

[02:45:22.450 --> 02:45:26.130]
My Ami's wife, starting OJ Simpson, has Sergeant Bruno Mali.

[02:45:26.570 --> 02:45:28.330]
The hard rough stuff's caught on duty.

[02:45:28.690 --> 02:45:30.750]
But the loving dad, uh, dad?

[02:45:31.050 --> 02:45:31.630]
Yes, dear.

[02:45:32.050 --> 02:45:33.450]
What's happened to mom?

[02:45:33.650 --> 02:45:34.450]
The bitch is dead.

[02:45:34.850 --> 02:45:35.570]
The bitch is dead.

[02:45:35.590 --> 02:45:36.410]
I feel the bitch.

[02:45:36.810 --> 02:45:38.310]
I'll get your room and do your homework.

[02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:42.390]
Miami's wife, starting OJ Simpson, has Sergeant Bruno Mali.

[02:45:42.390 --> 02:45:46.250]
On NBC this Saturday, the Dinchel is blue.

[02:45:46.430 --> 02:45:48.310]
Like at the 16-0-2 or 5-60 W.

[02:45:48.410 --> 02:45:51.470]
Let me see, the American public is obsessed with the same

[02:45:51.470 --> 02:45:53.230]
like, cancel the stories that have all been

[02:45:53.230 --> 02:45:54.830]
sationalized on television.

[02:45:54.890 --> 02:45:55.390]
That's right.

[02:45:56.310 --> 02:45:58.710]
So, the OJ thing that was like a part of everybody's life

[02:45:58.710 --> 02:46:00.450]
for several months on and on and on,

[02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:01.730]
they just can't let go of it.

[02:46:02.250 --> 02:46:03.050]
And a same would like,

[02:46:03.190 --> 02:46:05.470]
Oh my dad looks like me.

[02:46:05.690 --> 02:46:07.030]
Yeah, the same would jump in a Ramsey.

[02:46:07.490 --> 02:46:08.170]
Can't let go of that.

[02:46:08.910 --> 02:46:10.370]
And even when you do want to go of it,

[02:46:10.370 --> 02:46:13.990]
there comes MSNBC and everybody else with 15 more stories on it.

[02:46:15.410 --> 02:46:16.770]
You got the OJ story.

[02:46:17.270 --> 02:46:18.310]
You got John Bonet Ramsey.

[02:46:18.590 --> 02:46:20.290]
You got now Denise Rodman's making a comeback.

[02:46:20.450 --> 02:46:22.010]
Him and Carmen Electra getting busted,

[02:46:22.170 --> 02:46:23.670]
sneaking into parties where they're not invited.

[02:46:24.630 --> 02:46:27.230]
And all this crap with all these swill trash people.

[02:46:29.350 --> 02:46:31.430]
And the American public just sucking it up.

[02:46:31.470 --> 02:46:32.930]
Oh please, just a little more.

[02:46:33.130 --> 02:46:33.710]
Just a little more.

[02:46:33.890 --> 02:46:35.090]
Give me something to hang on to.

[02:46:35.230 --> 02:46:36.950]
Something is a substitute for like a life.

[02:46:39.870 --> 02:46:41.170]
Here's Northport Lauderdale.

[02:46:41.310 --> 02:46:41.410]
Hello.

[02:46:42.530 --> 02:46:42.790]
Hello.

[02:46:43.990 --> 02:46:45.030]
5607-0560,

[02:46:45.210 --> 02:46:47.590]
pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:49.910]
Here's a call from LaBelle.

[02:46:50.090 --> 02:46:50.210]
Hello.

[02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:51.550]
Hey Neil.

[02:46:51.770 --> 02:46:52.110]
Yes sir.

[02:46:52.650 --> 02:46:54.130]
Yeah, I'm from Michigan.

[02:46:54.450 --> 02:46:57.270]
I moved down here about six months ago.

[02:46:57.770 --> 02:47:00.150]
I grew up down here in the Detroit area.

[02:47:00.370 --> 02:47:00.710]
Yes sir.

[02:47:00.790 --> 02:47:01.950]
Relatives from Detroit.

[02:47:02.090 --> 02:47:04.430]
But I found this kind of interesting

[02:47:04.430 --> 02:47:08.630]
thing is that a lot of people around the area up there

[02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:12.390]
and even around the whole state suddenly became Red Wing fans

[02:47:12.970 --> 02:47:14.370]
after they won the...

[02:47:14.370 --> 02:47:14.950]
Oh, forget about them.

[02:47:15.150 --> 02:47:17.210]
They're down here where nobody here knows the hockey puck

[02:47:17.210 --> 02:47:17.870]
from their god day.

[02:47:17.890 --> 02:47:19.170]
Yeah, everyone on the roof.

[02:47:19.190 --> 02:47:21.610]
All of a sudden these people, after they won two Stanley Cubs.

[02:47:21.770 --> 02:47:23.930]
And even after the first one, but then the second one,

[02:47:24.110 --> 02:47:25.350]
everybody's a Red Wing fan.

[02:47:25.430 --> 02:47:26.590]
They're all show them when the Red Wing's coming.

[02:47:26.850 --> 02:47:28.070]
When he's Red Wing's, he's on.

[02:47:28.250 --> 02:47:30.190]
We've got 5,000 Red Wing fans here.

[02:47:30.450 --> 02:47:33.030]
And let's face it, this is not an area here South East Florida

[02:47:33.030 --> 02:47:35.210]
where we have a lot of Michigan people, believe me.

[02:47:35.250 --> 02:47:35.970]
Well, no kidding.

[02:47:36.370 --> 02:47:39.250]
And everyone's driving around up there, especially with their little flag.

[02:47:39.790 --> 02:47:41.710]
I would bet you that the people down here...

[02:47:41.710 --> 02:47:43.650]
Yeah, but at least at hockey town,

[02:47:43.830 --> 02:47:45.030]
at least they support the team.

[02:47:45.110 --> 02:47:47.270]
And to the second, then at least they pack the place.

[02:47:47.410 --> 02:47:50.490]
Well, I thought that was good from the Michigan standpoint.

[02:47:50.610 --> 02:47:50.750]
Yeah.

[02:47:51.570 --> 02:47:54.090]
Good hockey club gets some interest going in the sport.

[02:47:54.350 --> 02:47:58.530]
But down here, you know, people that were in those Red Wing's jerseys

[02:47:58.530 --> 02:48:02.130]
at the arena are the ones that have no clue what hockey is all about.

[02:48:02.130 --> 02:48:02.550]
Correct.

[02:48:02.790 --> 02:48:06.010]
You know, come on out and support your own team if you have no idea what...

[02:48:06.010 --> 02:48:07.670]
I thought it was a talent to be a front-running phony, believe me.

[02:48:07.710 --> 02:48:08.370]
I guess so.

[02:48:08.510 --> 02:48:08.970]
Okay, pal.

[02:48:09.270 --> 02:48:09.470]
See ya.

[02:48:09.830 --> 02:48:13.290]
See you in LaBelle, not 5,6705,60,

[02:48:13.450 --> 02:48:17.130]
pound 5,60 on the 18th T-line, 877,785,0.

[02:48:18.330 --> 02:48:21.090]
877,785,60,345 on the Florida Line.

[02:48:22.930 --> 02:48:23.890]
Let's do a Daniel.

[02:48:24.110 --> 02:48:24.270]
Hello.

[02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:25.710]
Hi, Daniel.

[02:48:25.850 --> 02:48:26.190]
How you doing?

[02:48:26.270 --> 02:48:26.730]
Okay, sir.

[02:48:27.110 --> 02:48:27.590]
Great show.

[02:48:28.450 --> 02:48:32.050]
My complaint is about these morons that the Dolphin J last night,

[02:48:32.510 --> 02:48:36.170]
where I was sitting, this guy was popping up in front of me every two seconds,

[02:48:36.290 --> 02:48:37.830]
regardless if they were...

[02:48:37.830 --> 02:48:39.610]
Who was driving or what was driving.

[02:48:40.290 --> 02:48:42.390]
I had a bazooka, but I've nailed him in the back.

[02:48:44.970 --> 02:48:45.330]
Yeah.

[02:48:46.370 --> 02:48:49.690]
And I think that they shouldn't make it open market with bazookas before.

[02:48:49.770 --> 02:48:52.190]
Okay, who was that in the doorway, by the way, that I wasn't paying any attention.

[02:48:52.350 --> 02:48:53.470]
Who was that standing in the doorway?

[02:48:53.590 --> 02:48:55.170]
How can you attract Adam Silverstein?

[02:48:55.490 --> 02:48:56.010]
Who wants what?

[02:48:56.570 --> 02:48:57.310]
Nothing from you.

[02:48:57.310 --> 02:48:58.090]
A spot problem.

[02:48:58.290 --> 02:48:59.890]
Oh, spot problem with our sales department.

[02:49:00.030 --> 02:49:00.370]
Okay, great.

[02:49:00.450 --> 02:49:01.870]
Handle it to a clock, Adam Silverstein.

[02:49:02.190 --> 02:49:02.630]
Get out of here.

[02:49:03.550 --> 02:49:04.610]
Go sell some spots.

[02:49:04.610 --> 02:49:05.650]
We've got lots of evils.

[02:49:06.790 --> 02:49:10.690]
5,670,560, pound 560 on the 18th T-Wireless Line.

[02:49:11.350 --> 02:49:11.910]
Here's Miami.

[02:49:12.130 --> 02:49:12.290]
Hello.

[02:49:14.330 --> 02:49:14.730]
Miami.

[02:49:15.070 --> 02:49:15.190]
Hello.

[02:49:15.670 --> 02:49:15.990]
Yes, sir.

[02:49:16.390 --> 02:49:18.030]
And Marino injury is a scam.

[02:49:18.930 --> 02:49:19.670]
I beg your pardon?

[02:49:19.910 --> 02:49:21.810]
And Marino injury is a great scam.

[02:49:21.950 --> 02:49:22.550]
He's not worked.

[02:49:22.830 --> 02:49:23.290]
Yeah, huh.

[02:49:23.690 --> 02:49:24.510]
Jimmy Johnson won.

[02:49:24.570 --> 02:49:25.390]
Okay, skin this.

[02:49:26.250 --> 02:49:29.130]
And by the way, next time you call, talk a little louder, okay?

[02:49:29.270 --> 02:49:30.950]
And whatever show it is, which better not be this one.

[02:49:31.210 --> 02:49:32.430]
Talk a little bit louder next time.

[02:49:32.490 --> 02:49:32.970]
Okay, sir.

[02:49:33.610 --> 02:49:34.190]
Thank you.

[02:49:35.630 --> 02:49:36.510]
Here's Port St. Lucy.

[02:49:36.710 --> 02:49:36.830]
Hello.

[02:49:37.630 --> 02:49:38.910]
Neil, thank you for taking my call.

[02:49:39.150 --> 02:49:40.270]
Thank you for making your call, sir.

[02:49:40.490 --> 02:49:41.850]
I don't know if you touched on it.

[02:49:41.910 --> 02:49:43.310]
I'm on my way down from the Tampa.

[02:49:43.710 --> 02:49:44.110]
People say that.

[02:49:44.210 --> 02:49:44.690]
Yes, go ahead.

[02:49:44.970 --> 02:49:46.950]
I'm on my way down from Tampa, and I'm just getting rained.

[02:49:47.210 --> 02:49:47.670]
I apologize.

[02:49:48.010 --> 02:49:49.070]
I'm rehashing something.

[02:49:49.150 --> 02:49:52.990]
I just want to find out what you thought about that of the judges ruling on Microsoft.

[02:49:53.770 --> 02:49:54.850]
I have no interest.

[02:49:55.950 --> 02:50:03.730]
Well, I think it's kind of ridiculous that Bill Gates is being penalized for something he thought of from an monopoly when the

[02:50:03.730 --> 02:50:06.850]
you see is letting every week a few companies buy up here.

[02:50:06.970 --> 02:50:08.470]
We already touched on this earlier in the show.

[02:50:08.570 --> 02:50:09.370]
I have no interest.

[02:50:09.430 --> 02:50:12.230]
Okay, it's a hypocritical country and hypocritical government.

[02:50:12.610 --> 02:50:17.130]
Well, sure is, especially if you get tired of your electric, who do you get to go pick and choose from?

[02:50:17.150 --> 02:50:22.130]
In addition to which, so they charged $89 for something that they could have charged $49 still made of profit.

[02:50:22.130 --> 02:50:23.670]
I thought that's what's called free enterprise.

[02:50:23.970 --> 02:50:26.150]
I thought whatever the market will bear, that's what you're going to charge.

[02:50:26.410 --> 02:50:27.730]
And if you can get it more power to you.

[02:50:28.030 --> 02:50:30.790]
And if a man is smart, what he would do is continue on what he's doing.

[02:50:31.010 --> 02:50:32.290]
Just do not ship anything.

[02:50:32.810 --> 02:50:35.510]
And within the end of three months, you'll see the government calling back home.

[02:50:35.650 --> 02:50:35.870]
Okay.

[02:50:36.390 --> 02:50:36.970]
Thank you, Senator.

[02:50:37.190 --> 02:50:39.690]
If the man is smart, what's he worked 200 and how many billion?

[02:50:40.610 --> 02:50:41.170]
If he's smart.

[02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:48.290]
$567.0560, pound $560 on an AT&T wireless line on one of the worst days in the history of my life.

[02:50:48.290 --> 02:50:51.250]
And this is not sure if this is enough to make you question your sanity.

[02:50:52.990 --> 02:50:54.490]
This collection we've had here today.

[02:50:55.910 --> 02:50:59.270]
And then between Todd Drek and Adam Silverstein, I mean, you just wonder.

[02:50:59.890 --> 02:51:03.050]
You just want to go home and go, what the hell is that?

[02:51:03.370 --> 02:51:04.590]
He can't even do that thing right.

[02:51:04.930 --> 02:51:06.590]
No, everything is limbolybri like that.

[02:51:08.270 --> 02:51:09.330]
Oh my God.

[02:51:09.670 --> 02:51:11.250]
I think it's time for vacation, you know what I'm saying?

[02:51:11.450 --> 02:51:12.230]
Long vacation.

[02:51:13.890 --> 02:51:14.810]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[02:51:15.670 --> 02:51:16.550]
Good morning, man. How are you?

[02:51:16.550 --> 02:51:17.010]
Okay.

[02:51:19.210 --> 02:51:19.930]
You're the best.

[02:51:20.430 --> 02:51:20.550]
Yeah.

[02:51:22.950 --> 02:51:23.310]
And...

[02:51:23.310 --> 02:51:29.090]
I'm worried about those people who are giving us such a hard time because you said you do not believe in God.

[02:51:29.550 --> 02:51:29.730]
Yeah.

[02:51:30.530 --> 02:51:31.850]
I mean, you are a free person.

[02:51:32.150 --> 02:51:33.930]
You have your right to believe or not to believe.

[02:51:34.070 --> 02:51:34.310]
Uh-huh.

[02:51:35.290 --> 02:51:36.970]
Who are those people who said that?

[02:51:37.130 --> 02:51:37.710]
What are you talking about?

[02:51:37.710 --> 02:51:42.570]
Well, you know, they call it, you know, they just give you such a hard time because of your belief system.

[02:51:42.930 --> 02:51:43.870]
Who are those people?

[02:51:43.990 --> 02:51:44.810]
I know what you're talking about.

[02:51:44.810 --> 02:51:45.910]
Uh-uh.

[02:51:45.910 --> 02:51:46.690]
Do you listen to this?

[02:51:47.510 --> 02:51:48.270]
Name me one.

[02:51:48.870 --> 02:51:51.590]
Do we have a colored day of giving me a hard time because I don't believe in God?

[02:51:52.310 --> 02:51:53.250]
I have that today, yeah.

[02:51:53.330 --> 02:51:53.510]
No.

[02:51:53.990 --> 02:51:54.990]
Listen, uh, no.

[02:51:55.230 --> 02:51:57.350]
Can you tell me why there is so much violence in the Bible?

[02:52:00.250 --> 02:52:03.010]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:52:03.090 --> 02:52:04.470]
Here's a call from Gainesville. Hello.

[02:52:05.530 --> 02:52:06.990]
Why there's so much violence?
