[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140]
So here's the story. Neal Rogers is out sick. Please don't call.

[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.500]
George Rodriguez is also out sick. Please don't call.

[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.820]
Sports Radio 560 QAM presents the best of Neal Rogers.

[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.940]
Enjoy, sit back and please do not call.

[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.920]
Princess, come. Princess, come. Princess, come.

[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.180]
She's really good.

[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.260]
Come and do a tunnel. Hello, walk.

[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.160]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.020]
Hey, Neal, how you doing? Great, sir.

[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.480]
Yeah, well, I thought about the Princess Di-Ting.

[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.660]
Princess Di-Ting.

[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.060]
Yes, sir. You're right about it.

[00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.740]
Are you a shook up about it, sir?

[00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.500]
No, no, I'm really shook up about it, man.

[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.460]
The thing is, how can people say, oh, the two kids are going to be back,

[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.480]
they're going to be motherless?

[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.260]
You know how many mothers are told you said,

[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.700]
oh, millions of mothers die on kids that are like to say crap babies and things like that?

[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.720]
Right. And they go to the island.

[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.960]
And then poverty, who wind up out on the streets having to pedal themselves,

[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.720]
and wind up as drug addicts and living till maybe they're 18 years old

[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.440]
and then they wind up getting killed or croaked.

[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.340]
And these kids are going to be multi-millionaires.

[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.280]
The one kid is going to be the king. The other one will probably be the queen.

[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.080]
And I mean, what are we talking about?

[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.760]
And everybody's all upset about these poor boys.

[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.600]
What's going to happen to them all?

[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.360]
Poor wolves and poor hairy.

[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080]
I'm telling you, we're talking about the mentored people, sir.

[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.540]
You're right.

[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.860]
It's one thing for the British to be silly, because they can't help it.

[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.160]
But why do we have to try to be as silly as they are?

[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.940]
You're right. You're right. You're right.

[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.380]
How many kids go through foster care?

[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.080]
Right. Like seven, oh, that I can five or six years ago.

[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.260]
Thank God for you, sir.

[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.860]
Thank God for somebody's bound to be.

[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.100]
And the thing is, you can't escape it, especially I can't get my hand in.

[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.660]
You can't escape it. Kind of, sir. It has a channel 10, live up to five or five or five or one PM.

[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.260]
You know, you can escape that.

[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.620]
And even now, even now, like on MSNBC, oh, let's have some more updates about the royal family.

[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.200]
And about here's a spencer.

[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.860]
He's charging admission. He's getting all set up for people to come see the gravesite.

[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.280]
Give it a rest already. We don't care. Okay. We don't care.

[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.380]
And if we do care, we shouldn't care.

[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.760]
They know for all of the one thing, man.

[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.060]
And Tana from Pierce Lee, the anti-crime.

[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.700]
Okay.

[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.300]
That's where we get all those taxes from.

[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.260]
But this is a good guy, though, who actually knew what Kelly was talking about,

[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.960]
which don't happen to off it in this town.

[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.520]
Oh, come on. Look at what he was talking about.

[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.580]
Cut the crap already.

[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.860]
Good find those roads.

[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.660]
May you well grow in our hearts.

[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.940]
You are the greatest place.

[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.260]
Are you sure?

[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.620]
Will I have to throw the bar?

[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.940]
You pull out too out, country.

[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.100]
And you whisper.

[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.460]
So I'm paying now you belong to Heaven.

[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.000]
And the star fell out to your name.

[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.680]
Let's just go meet the Spice Girls and screw him, okay?

[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.040]
Daddy.

[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.820]
Yeah, Daddy. Can we go meet the Spice Girls?

[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.800]
Daddy's too busy screwing the Spice Girls.

[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.880]
You don't have time for you guys to meet the Spice Girls.

[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.600]
What?

[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.640]
You've seen what he is.

[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.320]
Oh, yes.

[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.380]
She's a real beauty.

[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.960]
Well, when look at him.

[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.500]
Like I said, he's got those ears to keep money.

[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.220]
Might fall in.

[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.140]
Get any ass he wants.

[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.620]
In fact, if you read the book to Royals, you know, when he was a little bit older than he

[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.440]
should have been to find out about what the sex was all about, which he didn't really understand,

[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.280]
how it worked.

[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.160]
And Philip told him, just pretend you're riding a rocking horse.

[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.760]
Seriously, this was when he was in his 20s, Charles, with the big ears, Dumbo, with the ears.

[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.700]
Can this pretend you're riding a rocking horse?

[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.880]
Seriously, you've got to read that book.

[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.620]
I mean, it's a big book, but you will say, you'll pee in your pants like the Queen Mom.

[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.100]
She's sitting up there one day and she picks up the phone to call downstairs for all the guys that she wants her drink,

[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.120]
a real drunk, a lush, like most of the royal family.

[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.060]
And she's ringing and ringing and they're not answering down to the servants.

[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.480]
And she finally picks up the intercom and she says, when you queens down there, get through a talk and do whatever you're doing,

[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.240]
and this old queen up here would like a drink.

[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.600]
Not that there are any queens in Buckingham Palace except Elizabeth and the Queen Mom, of course.

[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.920]
Right.

[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.740]
Anyway, by the way, we got a special message for all of our 85 sales managers upstairs.

[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.080]
Go sell some spots.

[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.520]
Don't come down here and hock George and China can try to, you know,

[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.020]
like yesterday when I had my bad experience, which I'm not going to talk about on the year,

[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.640]
with a former sponsor whom I will never, ever endorse again,

[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.220]
and I hope never to be involved with again, who screwed me over so badly that I'm still in shock.

[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.520]
In fact, I'm debating even telling the story on the year, which I just might do.

[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.680]
If the anger surfaces again, which is subsided, but it just might come back thinking about it.

[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.060]
Why is it that almost everywhere we go, George, there's like too many chiefs and not enough Indians.

[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.900]
Everybody's got a title. It was the same way it cocks, the same way it's all paction.

[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.000]
They had 100 million people with titles.

[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.240]
Nobody to get anything done, but everybody had a title.

[00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.820]
For example, Roar!

[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.680]
Yeah, there was a good example.

[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.760]
Chief asshole.

[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.740]
But, yeah, they come down yesterday and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:09.480]
Here's Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. I'm calling to tell you about these Cuban people here in my

[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:14.640]
own Cuban, right? I'm a student of FIU. Yes. And these people there, they're so pissed off

[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.540]
because the folks going to Cuba. And they should be, sir. They should. They should be what

[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:21.600]
the folks doing over there. The man can barely stand up. What you going to do? Should I

[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:25.520]
hold up? I'm in a case with another dictator. No, I'm an atheist, but what I'm just trying

[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:30.000]
to prove a point here. Go ahead. They also have a good job. They also get pissed off

[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.940]
because of the embargo. They want to keep the embargo, right? I've been doing a lot of

[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.540]
studies on how the embargo is affecting Cuba. Yes, sir. And a lot of people are suffering.

[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:42.640]
So my whole idea is these Cuban people here, they get to enjoy going to the hospital and

[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:46.540]
getting medical attention. They get to enjoy going to church if they believe in something

[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:53.220]
and praying. And then that's why myself in school, I can't relate with anybody because

[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.340]
I'm socialist. I called a few weeks ago to tell you that I was a socialist. A few weeks

[00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:02.800]
ago? Yeah. And the thing is, there's so much injustice. No, but the thing is really

[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:09.660]
new. Yes, listen, it's injustice because a lot of these Cuban people here, they have

[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:15.660]
so much money. And they will... Oh, you jealous or what? No, I'm not alone. No, no.

[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:21.420]
That's why I'm putting myself through college. I work here for you. Good for you. No handouts

[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:26.320]
for this guy. But the whole thing is, these people want to live a good life and sacrifice

[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.100]
to people in Cuba. Oh, yeah, we got to keep the embargo going. I don't care. Well, thank

[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.960]
God, leave on Hernandez doesn't that bad. I had to look at all the money he sent his

[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:37.440]
brother. Yeah, right. Not as in... Don't be trusted, boss. No way. I'm so sick of these

[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:41.740]
people here addicted. They contradict themselves because they themselves, they won't allow

[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:44.280]
other Cubans that don't think that way. So what would you say there's a lot of Cuban

[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:47.240]
hypocrites? Is that what you're saying there? No, that'll believe it. That's why they

[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:52.000]
fit in here so well. Yeah. All right, now have a great day. Good luck to you. Well, there's

[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.700]
a guy who's all pissed off. Good for him, Tommy. In fact, that's what... That's what

[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.640]
leave on Tolda Elduke when he asked him for some money. I will not give it to you. That's

[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.660]
what he told him. He said, you're making the big bucks with the marlins. You're a millionaire

[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:06.680]
now. They've demoted me because of you because you defected. And now I'm desperate. I make

[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.780]
an eight dollars a year or whatever the hell it is. I'm plowing in the fields over here.

[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.320]
I'm playing on some sandlot team. I need some money. I'm going to have to defect myself

[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:17.000]
and go to the Bahamas and get Joe Cubans to be my agent and make 80 billion dollars.

[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:20.380]
Loan me some money. Leave on. I will not give it to you. All right. So what did the guy

[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:25.900]
say? I wasn't really paying much attention. He's a calmist. Well, he's a self-hating

[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:29.440]
spick like you are. You should relate to him. He's pissed off of these Cubans that are,

[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:33.640]
first of all, this business with a pope coming there next week. I mean, this is... It's

[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:38.100]
really amusing because there's this tremendous conflict now with a lot of the Cuban people.

[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.000]
On the one hand, as much as they've been brainwashed by the Catholic Church, oh, well, Papa,

[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.280]
Papa, Papa, Papa smoked a rope on whatever the hell it is. But then on the other hand,

[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.880]
the pope is going to come there and cozy up to Fidel. Now, maybe the pope is the one

[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:53.740]
that's going to stick to stuff in his cigar or in his beard or in his shoes or in his

[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:58.300]
rectum, which might have the whole reason that that communism fell over in Russian so

[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.720]
we at Union. I'm going to hear that. You hear that? I'm going to hear that on the news.

[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:04.700]
I make you pardon? The pope? They were giving him credit for... I thought it was your

[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:09.080]
end of the Cold War. I thought it was Teddy Roosevelt. Yeah. Yeah, not a year. The pope

[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:12.260]
that seemed out well, oh, listen, the way they covered this thing, of course, because

[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:15.940]
they're afraid they might offend somebody if they tell you the truth. Oh, and Tony cigarette

[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:20.660]
always on there again on Channel 6. Oh, the pilot that... And that Ike Siemens, I'm going

[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:24.900]
to tell you something. There's our asshole of the year. Ike Siemens on Channel 6. Look

[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:28.520]
up the word suckhole in the dictionary and you'll see his picture next to it. So anybody

[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:32.240]
who wonders is I did out loud for a long time. How come this guy who used to be a big

[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:36.040]
hot shot correspondent for NBC Network is now here in Miami to station that most people

[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:40.420]
can't pick up on their set because he's a suckle because he blows water disgrace. If

[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:43.860]
he's not doing his parent job for the Harold or Mickey Harrison, he's doing a parent

[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:49.460]
job for the pope. The pope's parrot, Ike Siemens, disgraceful. What a disgrace you are. I don't

[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.860]
call us anymore either. We don't want to talk to you. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:59.160]
Neil, how you doing? Great. I like the opportunity to respond to that jerk who's called you

[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:03.100]
like I've heard him call you two or three times. And every time he calls, he says that he's

[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:07.160]
a student, a Cuban student and he's an atheist which is fine because that's why you're in

[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:12.480]
this country to do whatever you want with nobody criticizing you. That's why, pal. That

[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:17.340]
is why we don't want to send anything over to Cuba because if we continue to send over

[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:21.100]
things to Fidel, you think he's ever going to get the hell out of there? I got news for

[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:25.560]
you. This show that's on right now on this radio. You can call up and state whatever

[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.820]
you want. Neil could say whatever you want. Well, they don't like to do that over their

[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:32.880]
pal. And we continue to send over their stuff to that jerk off. He's going to continue

[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:36.620]
to be there forever. But we should have sent somebody they'll do it. Just to keep him

[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:40.400]
there. You know, he's got the right to do whatever you want to. That's the whole point

[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:44.140]
over there. We don't have the right to do whatever the hell we want to do or say whatever

[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:47.840]
we want to say. And if we continue to send things over there, wouldn't it help if that

[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:52.020]
they're going to get that out of there? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:55.740]
That's the answer. If there's not sending things over there, but are we sure as hell don't

[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:58.720]
do that. I'm there forever. Do you think the people in Cuba want to have the right to

[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:02.120]
speak like we speak to you? And you say whatever they want to say and talk about your

[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:07.980]
ruins and all that stuff? Exactly. And I bet you most of them have got a bad case from

[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:22.300]
Fidel. Absolutely. Give them the right to speak over there. That jerk off. Okay. You

[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:27.240]
just have to be simulation. Like that.

[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:57.780]
So

[00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:57.780]

[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:18.580]
You make me sick. Get out of Cuba quick. You are so goddamn rich. You am ego.

[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:32.760]
You are my sister. They're all we know you like. Are you behind the strike? Where are you in 63?

[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:48.560]
Did you kill Kennedy? More than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than

[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.020]
more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than more than what

[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:49.020]

[00:51:49.020 --> 00:52:02.900]
Who are you in to transportation fees? There will be exambox, I will become another key log of USA, USA.

[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:03.560]

[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:09.860]
We're turning all the raps and modes away.

[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:12.260]
Loser!

[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.860]
Cast, throw, get out of Cuba.

[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.420]
We just can't use your...

[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.080]
You've been around way too long.

[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:22.300]
Oh!

[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:24.700]
Cast, throw, you ugly bastard.

[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:29.100]
How long you last, the pay-out pigs should have worked.

[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:29.760]
I want it!

[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.180]
You're sick, you're sick.

[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.080]
You're not a human quick.

[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:34.960]
You're so goddamn rich.

[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:36.640]
You're a meagre son of a bitch.

[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:38.760]
This fall we know you're life.

[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.320]
Are you behind the strike?

[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:41.920]
Where were you in 63?

[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:43.380]
Did you kill John Kennedy?

[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:45.520]
Where's the...

[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.660]
Where's the...

[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:51.840]
That now in the donation are you into my foundation?

[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:53.880]
If they will, they will be in Baguio.

[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:55.320]
They will be coming out of the gillago.

[00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:58.920]
You are sick, you're sick.

[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.640]
Where's the mold of grass and box away?

[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:04.560]
Loser!

[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:06.020]
Loser!

[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:06.780]
Loser!

[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:09.380]
Let's go!

[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:15.480]
Okay, this last guy was worked up and rightfully so about the other caller.

[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.820]
Actually, I wasn't really paying too much attention to the other caller,

[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:19.960]
because I had just mentioned 85,000 different things,

[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:23.840]
and he starts hockin' a trinic about what the pope is going to do all these good things

[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:24.820]
in about the audio.

[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:27.220]
And then he turns around saying he's the atheist Cuban.

[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:29.060]
How can you be an atheist and have any...

[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:31.860]
How can you be a thinking person that any respect for the pope walkin' around

[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:36.040]
this feeble old man in a dress spewing stone age mentality and hatred

[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:38.420]
wherever he goes, but he never met a dictator he didn't like.

[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.760]
That's right, the pope never met a dictator that he didn't like.

[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:44.000]
But you think he wears a dress and a beanie for, huh?

[00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:45.860]
Mr. Machu over there in the Vatican.

[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:47.980]
We need him here like we need hemorrhoids coming back.

[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:50.040]
We just got rid of him and we're gonna have him back here.

[00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:51.920]
Jesus, don't miss the big...

[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:54.820]
I know that the Lord even loves neo-rodris.

[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.060]
Former minister charged with pistol whipping a man,

[00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:59.700]
also operated a drug-wringer prosecutor says.

[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:04.960]
Charles Evans was the senior pastor for 17 years at the Trinity Assembly of God Church in Deltona.

[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:08.380]
If his case goes to court, the testimony of 201,

[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:11.520]
the alleged accomplices will be used to prove that Evans' b-jason wheeler

[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.840]
over several thousand dollars stolen from the alleged drug-ring,

[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:17.660]
a system state attorney Greg Pinin told the Orlando Sentinel.

[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:21.020]
And returned for their testimony, Matt Clark and Frank Kuba T.A.

[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:22.420]
Sound like a frog to me.

[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.620]
We'll receive full immunity and no drug charges.

[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.280]
We'll be filed against either them or Evans.

[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.020]
How do you like that?

[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.580]
Another minister gone wrong, gone bad, gone sour.

[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.000]
They're speaking tongues there.

[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:31.740]
And do tricks.

[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:32.420]
They do tongues?

[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.600]
Oh, by the way, most guys in the audience are jealous of car machine number five,

[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.880]
because it got eaten this morning.

[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:37.760]
It got ate.

[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:39.640]
Or at least one of the carts got eaten at machines.

[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:41.440]
Hey, listen, it's a good thing.

[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:43.800]
Because if all carts get eaten in all those machines,

[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.020]
they may have to actually go out and buy a new cartex.

[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.740]
If they're all filled with tape all mangled up inside of them,

[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.920]
we can work on these, although I think it already does that.

[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.000]
And then on the bottom, oh, this, you know, something.

[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:55.660]
First of all, I'll test it again.

[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:57.520]
I'm listening to Mandits driving home yesterday,

[00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:58.700]
and he's got a guy on here.

[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:03.300]
And one of these real joc guys who all he knows lives to eat and breathe the stupid sports.

[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:07.720]
And the guys telling them about how on Sunday, he was really torn.

[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:11.760]
Because on the one hand, he definitely had to watch his green bay peckers when they're ball game.

[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:16.540]
But on the other hand, there were not one but two golf tournaments going on at the same time.

[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:19.540]
And he was torn as to which one he was going to tape.

[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.240]
Now, I'm going to tell you right now, people who watch.

[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:24.960]
If you want to go out and play golf or some exercise, that's fine.

[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.540]
That's up to you or keep you out off the streets.

[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.760]
But people who watch golf on television have a mental problem.

[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:33.700]
I mean, there's something desperately, desperately wrong with watching golf.

[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:36.780]
You talk about ponderous and tedious and no action,

[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:39.720]
even assuming that it was interesting to watch, which it's not.

[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.100]
But professional golf is and always has been a blue-nose sport.

[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:48.180]
And I remember all the big semis that we had a couple of years ago when he started talking about Tiger Woods.

[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.080]
And then last year, and this year, oh my god, this is the greatest thing.

[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:54.140]
We got a guy who's black, he's Taiwanese, he's this, he's that.

[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:56.840]
And they wouldn't let this guy in there and he goes there to Augusta.

[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.360]
And he sticks it up their nose and he wins the masters.

[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:01.860]
And he's got the jacket on and he's making millions of dollars.

[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:04.560]
And they didn't even want black guys anywhere near that joint.

[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.500]
And that was supposed to be a big deal.

[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:10.320]
It's a blue-nose deal is what professional golf is all about.

[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.520]
Just a bunch, yes, noody blue-noses.

[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:14.040]
And that's some guy called Madagascar.

[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:19.920]
Yesterday, I was in Hank the day before about, oh, was it Madagascar today about, oh, well, the Scottish rules in Scotland.

[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:23.680]
I go pull your kilts up, let's see if you got anything there which I doubt.

[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:26.120]
You asshole, the Scottish rules.

[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.240]
Go play your bagpipes, will you pal?

[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:30.080]
I've got a chanter for you over here.

[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.480]
So the Sun Sentinel says, fairness and tradition must prevail.

[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:35.480]
Walk is part of golfers' challenge.

[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:36.580]
Says who?

[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:40.240]
Does any, yeah, walking is pretty damn tough.

[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:45.020]
Well, it is if you're handicapped, I've had it that and you got like a leg that's like all atrophied and can barely walk.

[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:45.940]
Right, that being present.

[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:47.700]
Yeah, well, that's this guy.

[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.220]
That's the guy that all the citizens is all about.

[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:56.980]
The guy, Casey Martin, who was born with this handicapped and happens to be a pretty damn good golfer for those who care about it.

[00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:04.280]
And you would think that anybody with any balls, anybody with a brain would have the guts to say, okay, well, this is a wonderful human interest story here.

[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:07.760]
We're always seeing all these crypts playing every other kind of sport.

[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:09.200]
Here's a crypt who's doing this.

[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.320]
Here's a guy with no arms.

[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:11.280]
He's doing that.

[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:18.380]
And, you know, and we always applaud these people for their courage and setting an example for everybody else and you two can do it and bop bop bop bop.

[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:19.140]
Be beep beep, right?

[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:20.340]
I can't believe you're saying, crypt.

[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:21.340]
You should say, gim.

[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:22.220]
How's the crypt?

[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.720]
Isn't that what Ron DS said?

[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.280]
How's the crypt?

[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:25.600]
Oh, how's the crib?

[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:26.700]
I thought he said, how's the crypt?

[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.500]
Talking about Tommy Kramer again.

[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:32.880]
So anyway, this thing goes, I'm reading this editorial this morning sitting on the throne.

[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.680]
And man, it worked like a charm, by the way.

[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.320]
I mean, I was moving at big time.

[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:41.700]
And he's talking about how walking the course in Ken Venturi almost croaked or a heat exhaustion.

[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.680]
You know, something that's a pile of crap.

[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:49.560]
Nobody, even the assholes that watch golf on television, are not interested in watching the golfers walking the course.

[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.760]
If they all got on a cart, it would speed it up.

[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.760]
It would make it much less boring and much less pondering.

[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:56.120]
And stamina has got little or nothing to do with it.

[00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:01.880]
People are a golfist all about hitting the ball and putting the ball and being able to play good golf.

[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:02.900]
That's what it's all about.

[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:07.780]
But the best part of this, it says if Martin is allowed to use a cart because of leg problems,

[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:11.640]
should Fred Couples be allowed to use a cart because of this problem that from time to time,

[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:13.420]
hamper his ability to compete, you think?

[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:14.020]
Yes!

[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:16.400]
What the hell not?

[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:20.740]
The contorting nature of the golf swing often causes back problems among the pros.

[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:23.960]
Should a golfer with a severe lumbago be exempted from walking the course?

[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:24.660]
Yes!

[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.840]
And the Sun Sentinel says, absolutely not.

[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:32.600]
To allow only certain golfers to use carts is unfair to others.

[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:37.900]
To permit all golfers to use carts is unfair to the traditions of the game.

[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:42.080]
As an excuse me, my nose is way way up in the air.

[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:45.660]
You people of the Sun Sentinel are a bunch of assholes man.

[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:53.740]
In my life, including the herald, any rag I've ever read, I have never read anything so arrogant, so obnoxious, so unacceptable,

[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:56.740]
so disgusting as this swill that you wrote in there this morning.

[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:59.120]
It's unfair to the traditions of the game.

[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:02.340]
As in, well let's keep all the blacks out, let's keep all the coins out.

[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:03.500]
That was a tradition of the game.

[00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:06.420]
Let's not ever change because it's traditional, like slavery.

[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:07.380]
That was traditional too.

[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:09.320]
It is the Sun Sentinel favorite slavery.

[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:13.340]
Maybe that was traditional for a hell of a long time, for like a couple of hundred years here.

[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:15.980]
You miserable bastards over there at the Sun Sentinel.

[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.640]
You haven't got a brain in your rectum man.

[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:22.540]
First they want us to go ahead and build a $300 million stadium because we desperately have got to have a baseball team here.

[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:23.180]
God forbid.

[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:30.260]
Even if we wind up taxing people for it, but on the other hand, if this poor guy who I, and they're like they said this morning on the worst team,

[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:39.680]
now there's not one guy on the professional tour who's got the balls, including Tiger Woods with his millions of dollars for being a mediocre piece of turd, a freaking golfer and he's making millions of dollars.

[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:46.560]
You had a kiss, the goddamn ground, and now one of them has got the balls to say, hey, this is wrong to discriminate against this guy.

[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:50.280]
If he can play this good, I hear guys saying, well he's not really a threat to them.

[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:53.980]
What does that mean? He's not a threat to them. Are they that much of a bunch of a pussy?

[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:55.540]
What they mean is they could beat him up.

[00:59:55.740 --> 01:00:00.680]
I think what they ought to do is say guys that have had cancer like Arnold Palmer shouldn't be allowed to play the game anymore.

[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:06.320]
How's that? That old fart who really needs the money badly on that seniors tour where you got these guys talk about carts.

[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.120]
Those, those, and of course those guys can have carts by the way.

[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.120]
The old fart, that's okay because they're old.

[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:15.040]
What if this guy brought like a wheelchair, you know electric powered wheelchair?

[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.760]
Then all the guys are going to want wheelchairs, trouble maker.

[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:25.480]
This, this is so unbelievable to me that a major market alleged newspaper would write it is absolutely unfair.

[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:27.140]
It's absolutely not allowable.

[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:34.040]
Oh man, if there was an alternative, if there was like anything to read that had anything to do with life in this town,

[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:40.880]
besides these two garbage newspapers, man, I'd walk 10 miles to find one. Well, I'd use a golf cart.

[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.500]
Wouldn't walk that far. Not no fart like me.

[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.680]
And by the way, who's going to be doing the Panther games on radio now?

[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:51.500]
I have a little story by the way that you're not familiar with that nobody else knows, but I'll tell you anyway.

[01:00:51.920 --> 01:01:02.340]
I don't want to say which radio play by play guy for the Panthers was not just overheard us saying, but was screaming about a couple of weeks ago on our last road trip before this one.

[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:09.840]
When the rumors about us getting Dino Cicerelli started, because Cicerelli happens to be rumors of best buddy for years going back to Washington and whatever.

[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:18.900]
And the certain play by play guy. And by the way, maybe you can answer what time is Chris moron says in the press room where all the press people are.

[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:24.260]
He says, well, I'll tell you one thing. If we ever get Dino Cicerelli on this team, I'm walking out. I'm finished. I'm true.

[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:28.740]
That is that making sense to you other than the fact that he happens to be rumors good friend.

[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:35.180]
What would be the reason for that? I mean, Dino is a reasonable guy. I don't think Brian Bradley likes him too much, but nevertheless, he never's still afraid to train.

[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.980]
So what time is Chris moron?

[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:46.840]
Because I guess we're going to have to find somebody else to do those games because we got Dino. I guess that means Chris moron is on a way out because he's already stated publicly lots of witnesses is what I heard.

[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:56.460]
We get Dino. He's out. He's leaving. Hop on hop off hop aboard. However the hell that goes hop off hop on this jump on Z. Here's a mobile implantation. Hello.

[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:00.220]
Neil, yes sir. I want to talk about Casey Martin. Yes sir.

[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:14.700]
So I want to let you know your comments are right on that news favor yesterday. Had a comment about somebody having a I think it was all a follow or something out of bad toe and he was complaining about that he had a walkable course.

[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:20.460]
It doesn't have anything to do with a little bad toe. I mean the guy has a true disability and the car.

[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:25.040]
He was born with it's not going to go away. It's not fighting like he's got a bad back and it'll go away next week.

[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:33.880]
Exactly. I mean the car brings him up to the level that these other guys are at and they're just a bunch of wooseys that are afraid of being beaten by a guy with a disability.

[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:46.100]
I mean this business of walking the courses if walking for most people is such a big song to them. Nobody like I said before watches golf if they do because they want to see guys walking and taking this long, ponderous thing.

[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:53.820]
Who cares about that? Let's speed it up a little. Let's get everybody on a cart and speed up and get some action going for quite a lot. So it doesn't have to kill four hours every afternoon.

[01:02:53.820 --> 01:03:10.840]
Right on you. Okay pal. Thank you so much. What a bunch of spineless blue nose spoiled panty waist backers. They all are and for a kid like Tiger Woods who's been given this opportunity of a lifetime was now a multi multi multi multi millionaire rat who is formerly this guy's roommate by the way.

[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:16.380]
And I heard them talking this morning about how when he used to take this brace off his leg his leg would swell up like a goddamn bowling ball.

[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:28.280]
I mean it's kid this KC Martin evidently I'm not saying that golfers are great athletes. It's all relative but nevertheless within the context of that so called sport he is very courageous and a hell of a story.

[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:36.420]
But screw him because like the Sun Sentinel says I still can't believe this to permit all golfers to use cards is unfair to the traditions of the game.

[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:48.480]
Maybe it's time to change the traditions of the game. Have you ever thought about that you blue nose assholes at the Sun Sentinel who probably busy every afternoon out there playing golf and pulling each other's putt is that what you're doing out there you asshole idiots you.

[01:03:48.600 --> 01:04:00.680]
I mean I've read a lot of garbage being in this town for 22 years in both papers but I'm telling you man this this just takes the cake. See ordinarily it's just it's just not the proper it's not politically correct to take that position number one.

[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:13.060]
It's not that being politically correct is important but it goes to show you how important being a blue nose really is it even transcends political correctness which our newspapers of course almost always try to do like the thing with the stadium.

[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:22.500]
We don't care if it is taxpayers money we don't care if it's Wayne who's probably lied to us again and going to keep the baseball team we must have a baseball stadium and the sawgrass people are the ones to build it.

[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:39.480]
This is a great start let's get halfway to first place and you're the that's the politically correct answer as opposed to tell them stick up your ass because our schools are overcrowded and we don't have many to do anything down here and the city of my he's going bankrupt and is a joke and your priorities are all screwed up that would not be the politically correcting the say here's my any hello.

[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:45.260]
Hey Chris moron gone I'll be great from back up but that jet fan back on a jet and back to New York.

[01:04:45.260 --> 01:05:03.560]
Okay that would be great but anyway this is Casey Martin thing man you know I'm getting so tired of it when I look I used to walk home from school every day and my brother took the bus and I kicked his ass when I got home okay I walked okay you guys have got to get a shape and golf a sport it's not a sport it's a game.

[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:12.740]
Right exactly he did well said I'm very well said I mean listen I go fishing on the weekend but I'm not going to say I'm going to do the sport of fishing over the weekend.

[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:41.640]
Give me a break man this is just ridiculous but but in any case but I was I was watching that OJ Simpson thing and I got to tell you one of the crappy by-blocks was watching a lot of these black comics get up on stage and make some of white people about the you know I like people react with the verdict or whatever I see it all the time and if I was Goldman I got to tell you I would have a long time ago I at least hired somebody to kill him.

[01:05:41.640 --> 01:06:10.120]
I'm serious I'm sorry yeah every time I see I was at the track last night and I'm flipping the channels there before the race started sure enough my great luck come across the last 30 seconds of it and I will say this I Chris Myers from what they were saying this morning a little bit I saw because he was filming at the mouth even the last minute of that interview he evidently really put his feet to the floor and asked him some tough questions that kept you know basically said you did it don't you want to say you did it said it would so and of course he wouldn't you know anybody that doesn't want to put a bullet through OJs head is got to be an invasible.

[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:14.800]
This guy is the most disgusting he ought to be at the sunset and let her you look together that.

[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:26.160]
What I call the bump and no but in any case you know I'm a minority I'm Hispanic and I'm just a second tired of watching you know minority hide behind race would ever take responsibility.

[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.240]
I'm just tired of this.

[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:30.380]
I really am thank you have a great day.

[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.660]
Oh that was a great call.

[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:35.920]
I have his own show 6 to 10 with the booster might be okay sounds good to me.

[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:41.040]
Yeah what are we going to do when Chris more on walks out now because we got Dino do you don't think he's going to change his mind.

[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:55.320]
If you're cupping I want to bang in the butt honey with all the controversy over the Neil Rogers show we decided to run a comparison profile between Ed Watkins a new listener and Bob Newballs of WQA and veteran.

[01:06:55.320 --> 01:07:08.220]
Ed would you mind telling us your annual income oh I'd say 150,000 okay and Bob how much do you earn annually well I don't know but I'm kind of sure it goes up when I donate my sperm.

[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:21.580]
I see Ed what kind of card do you drive I have a BNZ3 Bob I've got me a 70 non C10 that don't got any floor born on Ed what are your thoughts about Neil's show on WQA?

[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:32.080]
I am most enlightening and entertaining on an eclectic level Bob I'll tell you what there ain't nothing like the boog and the sports babe lord I'll miss them.

[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:43.680]
Wow I could listen to sports all day for real man listen to sports all day long while this here Neil fellow is a homosexual misguided homophobic.

[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:59.160]
What hey don't you go calling me names I don't understand shut up I'll kill you gay boy lover get a life this concludes the WQA and listener profile you decide okay well we certainly do have a lot of men different kind of so I hear here's Coral Gables hello.

[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:12.980]
Hey Neil how you doing okay sir I'm a professional golfer and I kind of disagree with with this Casey Martin thing you know if you if you've played at high level you know caliber golf it's not like just going out with your buddies and run around and just slapping all over the park.

[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:29.020]
I mean the guy definitely has a distinct advantage by going out there playing with a car and and especially why can't we make an optional what there is a make if a guy's got a car or not well it's because of the fit fatigue factor and how do you got to walk it when and then a hot peak of summer when it's 110 degrees.

[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:42.880]
Great hard just breaks my heart man see that the when you're talking about athletic ability when you're talking about golf ability you're talking about hitting the ball putting that's what you're talking about those are the two things you're talking about is hitting the ball either

[01:08:42.880 --> 01:09:04.440]
off the tee or approach us and putting his little zone about golf and care I couldn't care less that's what it's all about nobody cares about how big you are how strong you are those things should all be eliminated a guy that weighs 350 pounds you'd be able to you know have just as much opportunity if he's a great golfer and can do all the other has the skills that you know would make him a top golfer nobody cares whether it can walk 150 or 200 yards.

[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:15.300]
Well the point is is though I know from playing when I take a car and play and as opposed to walking in play I know I'm definitely a lot more tied after I walk and I would get a car so there's no doubt about it.

[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:34.240]
Like I said it should be optional how about let's take baseball as an example how about Alex Fernandez who looks about as much like an athlete as I do it's got an ass bigger than the building that I'm sitting in you think you think that he's a great athlete sure he's an athlete of course based on what to throw a ball like he does sure it takes that like to sit on that mountain on I work them pictures over

[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:42.100]
definitely takes athletic ability there you go but it does it get to all about it only only in the sense only in the sense that he can stand out there at a

[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:50.460]
mound and throw a baseball 90 or 95 miles an hour and do whatever he does to get guys out that's what it's all about not because of the fact that he's in great shape where he could walk

[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:54.140]
from here to Montana without breaking into a sweat nobody cares about that.

[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:59.640]
Well is John Van Breesbrook a great athlete as you can turn athlete all he does is stand there in the gold net all night.

[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:09.660]
I got a new spot I got news for you John Van Beesbrook is a hundred times the athlete that any professional golfer will ever be let me say it again he's a thousand times the athlete

[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:15.940]
then any golfer will ever be do you watch hockey games sure and you think that all he does is stand there in front of the net have you ever seen the

[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:21.840]
goalie get crashed into like he has like last couple of games well you knew what it took to shoot 62 on a golf course maybe you'd have a difficulty.

[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:28.800]
Well go go go powder your nose will you go see what shade of brown or blue it is this week what it took to show to shoot a 62 on a

[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:40.200]
who gives a flying crap what it takes to shoot a 62 on a god damn golf course and like the guy said before which was one of the best calls I've ever had in my life it's a game not a sport it's a god damn game.

[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:48.800]
And in this case it's a rich man's game for guys who either got a lot of money or have some sponsor that's going to put them out there on the tour so that instead of getting a real job they can go out there running around

[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:55.840]
and whacking a god damn golf ball but don't tell me that because somebody's got a handicap he should be denied the opportunity to play a game

[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:03.700]
blue nose blue nose blue nose man it makes you want to puke oh yeah they're great athletes see people are I'll give you an example

[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:10.180]
jockey's jockey is some of the greatest athletes in the world and yet in the very few people if you said well you know who the greatest athlete

[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:22.440]
of the football players and golfers yeah right ever watch the thoroughbred horse race and seeing the the danger and the the split second decisions that have to be made and how close those horses are going to

[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:35.100]
sitting miles and out to each other big 2000 pound beasts with a mind of their own and here's this little guy weighs 102 pounds and he's sitting on there with holding the reins and he's going to try to control this 2000 pound animal

[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:43.800]
and get him to go to the right to the left to make them move just at the right time these are unbelievable athletes who's the better athlete I would say Tiger Woods is the best athlete in the world is what I would say

[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:57.980]
wouldn't you agree hopefully hear from a lot more blue noses and brown noses today because God if I could just learn what it takes to go out there and shoot a 62 or a 69 feel even George who is as you know not a sports buff to say the very best even he's pissed off

[01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:07.980]
I the more I think about the last call the angry I'm almost going to get my piles back I think from that car oh yeah the tremendous amount of athleticism and the tremendous amount of energy or

[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:16.220]
oh yeah I think first of all they got a caddy to carry the caddies the one that I'll be making most of the money he's slept around here getting all worked up carrying those heavy

[01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:21.820]
guy then clubs on his back and every time you watch any of this golf on TV which you can't avoid because on the weekend to fill the time

[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:30.640]
that's all they got on there and they show you know the guy hits the ball and that's it and now he puts the club back in the bag the caddies like a hunched over he's

[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:37.880]
carrying like to a hundred pounds of bags on his back and now they walk very very slowly and casually up the course to the next

[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:47.240]
the tea very very very slowly I mean give me a freaking break okay and this guy has the gall the only to compare any golfer and forget

[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:54.800]
about the fact I'm a hockey fan and he compares into the beasley just happened to choose that but to a hockey player just when the beasley were standing

[01:12:54.800 --> 01:13:00.260]
out there on his skate shuffling his feet during the national anthem he's exerting more energy at that point than any golfer and any

[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:08.160]
god damn whole tournament put together you jackass you idiot you moron you blue nose idiot in the so actually words escape me at this point

[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:14.000]
to find that there could be any people that's stupid but I guess the whole golfing world that's a whole separate mentality there a

[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:21.800]
blue nose mentality what's that expression again and this thing oh yeah it's unfair to traditions of the game that's right these great

[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:27.480]
athletic but what do you expect from people who are stupid enough to watch this crap I mean you talk about having no life

[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:33.260]
that you would sit and actually watch hours of this horse duty to watch a bunch of guys sitting there whacking a ball if you

[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:38.920]
want to go out and play get some exercise more power to you taste a little but if you want to go out there and sit in your fat

[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:47.040]
asterick and beer watching a bunch of guys whacking it and the ball to and you got serious what the watch calls don't think beer today oh I

[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:54.120]
wouldn't think so maybe a little shed Lee maybe a good can't be within father being yeah I'm sure that some of you did

[01:13:54.120 --> 01:14:00.180]
watch and shame on you the entire oh Jay think I know it's this morning I was turned on was NBC and they had a good

[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:05.240]
piece on there they had one of the attorneys from the civil case the Goldman's attorney from the civil suit and

[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:09.980]
the he told it exactly the way it is I mean just precisely they showed some of the clips and Chris Meyer was getting

[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:15.760]
up all popped up in the face and read in the post and agitated I guess Chris maybe expected OJ was going to come clean

[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.220]
right there on the air which he should have but of course he didn't and you know he would not and then he's trying to

[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:24.180]
like well the thing he said in the square but if I did do what I did out of love it was taking out a

[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:30.840]
context right you did it you did it you murdering bastard piece of crap you and now people are wondering well how

[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:36.540]
come he's doing all this public appearances because he's trying to rehabilitate his image now he's trying to

[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:42.280]
come back into mainstream he figures enough time has passed he's tired of being an outcast and he wants to

[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:47.960]
back in and he gets on there in lies and lies and lies oh there was only one beating there was only time one

[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:53.980]
time they forgot physical about oh Jesus give me a break give me a freaking break and of course poor Chris

[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:58.400]
Myers he's a jock guy he's a sports guy he don't have the facts there in front of him he doesn't have the

[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:02.540]
list of all the damn dates of all these incidents that were well documented especially in the civil

[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:07.080]
case which by the way he was found responsible meaning guilty that yes you did murder them in your

[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:10.540]
own thirty three million dollars even though they're not getting a penny of it got four million

[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:15.160]
dollars in his trust fund and his pension fund whatever the hell is which they can't touch the touch

[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:19.720]
of penny and doing the best to hide each and every dime that he's got so here's a guy that really is

[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:24.320]
very very concerned about making sure that you know people get paid that his kids get taken care of

[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:28.960]
and everybody else to just unbelievable I'm you know something not that I think of it even though I

[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:33.340]
only saw the end of it I'm glad they did put him on I'm glad they put him on again as a reminder of

[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:38.860]
what a piece of 30 years I hope he turns about what's his favorite thing golf I rest my case and here's

[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:43.420]
a guy who allegedly has two bad knees he can barely walk he's got arthritis he's got this is hands

[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:48.000]
are are a shrubble they're crumpled are blah blah blah blah but he can't do a damn thing so what do you

[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.480]
say she would give him a cart stick it into one of those walking oven sounds good to me here's

[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:58.280]
Carl Gables hello hello yes sir a meal listen on that golfing there's one thing everybody forgot and

[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:04.400]
what is that sir you know the USGA the PGA governs all the tours yeah PGA tour right and the

[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:09.640]
senior tour right seniors can ride if they want to right so they're contradicting themselves uh-huh

[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:14.860]
I mean if you can take a guy because he's old or because of this is a condition and he's a pro

[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:20.160]
and he can ride an tournament why can't this young fellow do it uh-huh makes sense amen good show

[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:23.680]
thank you sir all right have a great day yeah it seems to make sense to all of us with an

[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.720]
IQ larger than our index finger but not the sun sent and the land of course the blue noses and the

[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:31.540]
players themselves who are spineless and gutless and like they said on the worst team this morning

[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:35.620]
uh- in private now they're positive and I'm positive too a lot of these guys are saying boy this

[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:41.080]
is a bunch of crap but as usual in this country and in this world very few guys very few people

[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:45.240]
anywhere have got the cahons they actually stand out from the group and say this is injustice this

[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:49.620]
is a bunch of bull crap let this poor guy play and stop it all a caca and we're all a bunch of

[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:54.540]
overpaid spoiled rotten brats and making a lot of money and cut the crap already all right cut the

[01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:59.020]
crap I mean who the hell would you rather have playing out there on the tour casey martin or Curtis

[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:04.400]
strange you know what I'm saying I rest my case or that goddamn Greg Norman send him to us

[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:08.260]
straight up send him back where he came from I'm so tired of him oh but he sure was good friend

[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:12.920]
and he said this one's great great he's got more money than god let him my retire already and the

[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:17.640]
same way that damn Nicholas and all those old parts on that let him go do something productive man

[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:22.880]
oh man see I don't understand that how can you go your whole life and you play golf you did

[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:27.140]
it for a living you did it very well and then you get to a certain age and you know what and then

[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:31.120]
you continue playing there's the seniors tour and it's like when they tried and hockey you remember

[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.300]
that lasted for about a minute and a half the thing with the old parts league that seriously that

[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:39.400]
lasted for about three weeks and nobody had any interest nobody wants to see a bunch of old

[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:44.640]
parts bubbling around out there watching red Kelly he's 75 years old and Johnny Barr and all these

[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:49.340]
who do I want to see that that's not sports which proves what I've said all along because golf

[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:53.940]
is not a sport in the first place oh here we go channel four journey of hope with the Pope the

[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:59.480]
Pope's coming to Cuba baby I grab we got some hope what the hell hope is he gonna bring them all

[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:03.980]
he's gonna bring them is a bunch of stone age dark age crap and a bunch of empty promises which

[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:08.400]
nobody will ever fulfill a lot of rhetoric and of course naturally many of these get skis there will

[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:12.340]
come under hands and ease with their last few pesos like they do in Mexico and Brazil and all

[01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:17.340]
over Latin America all here for the Pope for the Pope for his operation for his whatever yeah

[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:21.880]
those altar boys are a lot more demanding than they used to be that's right 30 40 30 40

[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:26.040]
thousand lira that don't cut it anymore I'll yearn to you that here's a mobile in Del Rey Beach hello

[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:30.400]
nail yes sir how you doing great uh it's just want to throw something out you might have commented

[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:35.380]
on it already I'm just got in the car but I was watching the news this morning and I slow

[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:40.440]
story about that woman out in Texas they're about to execute yeah and uh they were you know she

[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:46.260]
hacked all these people with ice picks and she supposedly had an orgasm when she was doing it

[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:50.060]
didn't mean that yeah this came out in the court and everything but now they're getting ready to

[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:55.860]
execute her and she found God which hey at each of own everybody does their own thing I'm not

[01:18:55.860 --> 01:19:01.940]
against that but now the church is coming out that she's because she's born again they shouldn't

[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:07.600]
execute her um so on and so forth and I just like to get your opinion on it and um if you don't

[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:11.840]
mind I'll hang out well in my opinion about what nothing what do you think about the whole thing I

[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:17.120]
think it's ludicrous people are coming out oh listen everybody that goes in the slammer especially

[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:22.300]
on death throw every one of them finds the lord uh from G Gordon Litty to I mean Colson and right

[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:26.920]
on the line every last damn one of them becomes a religious nut and I say uh give her I was going

[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:31.500]
to say fry a rasp but they don't do that do they they attack the legal injection right so

[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:36.080]
thicker with an eagle immediately she might enjoy it take care of how okay pal she's going to

[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:40.580]
anyway right yeah she's gonna be up there in heaven she'll be at the squirrely gates so what's

[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:45.080]
wrong with that oh I mean if she believes which of course is one of the really great parts about

[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.220]
these religious nuts all of the matter what you do during your life if you've stepped the lord

[01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:51.760]
before you croak no matter how many people you killed and if Hitler would accept the lord on his

[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:55.000]
deathbed of course he wasn't in bed when he shot himself well if he would have done that they're

[01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.760]
in the bunker with guy junker I got you down exactly I mean give me a freaking break already with

[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:04.720]
heaven and hell and purgatory and the devil and the pitch for elegant waters been

[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:11.540]
done by the way speaking of going to hell did you see the thing on uh oh j yesterday which oh j

[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:15.260]
the remember a couple of years how well how long is this thing been going on like last year

[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:19.360]
there were the rumors that he was gonna come down here and move here and everybody said go the

[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:23.520]
hell away everybody with a brain that is said go the hell away we don't want you here and then

[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:27.660]
a kind of cool off he was a building his new house or buying a new house and wherever the hell he

[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:33.180]
is in LA and all of a sudden he's back again for another celebrity golf tournament for charity

[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:38.260]
this was yesterday I guess how come we didn't know about that because we're all alone over here

[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:42.860]
but it was Martin Luther King day don't you understand the significance of this it was Martin Luther

[01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:48.120]
over by the way we have our DSS so we're not as alone as you might think but at any rate he was in

[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:54.420]
town yesterday at this charity golf tournament on Martin Luther King day this murdering miserable no good

[01:20:54.420 --> 01:21:00.220]
let me chop your word hurts the most bastard is in our town and they put it on the news last

[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:03.920]
that I'm at the track watching this and they're wow oh j's getting comfortable here he's starting

[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:09.120]
to like it here so I guess the rumors are resurfacing that just maybe he might be coming back and not

[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:13.420]
only is it bad enough that he's here but they have to go up to the golf tournament stick the mic in his

[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:19.640]
face so we can give us all a lecture on morality do you be seeing that I saw cheese but I didn't see the

[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:25.640]
he he'd be pissed off he'd be highly pissed off oh Jay oh man exactly because he's sick and

[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:29.780]
tired of all these judgemental people who just won't let go of it already just let go of it and the

[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:34.800]
knife too is what oh JB said because you know when you get to the this was my favorite part he says

[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:40.260]
when you get to the pearly gates the man doesn't like people who you know our judge metal and hold

[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:44.480]
the grudge whatever the hell he was saying when you get to the pearly great grates and I'm thinking

[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:49.220]
well what does the man think about guys who murder two people in cold blood if you don't

[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.220]
that's right that's okay if you know have enough money it only hurts for a little while that's

[01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:58.360]
what they say so oh Jay's back to haunt us again they're just some of these back to tool never go away

[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:03.320]
let me let me speak for the entire community except a few retarded people and some very very stupid

[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:07.360]
misguided horny women you see the brought out there oh she wants to marry him this light

[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:12.800]
complex black chick which he's out anyway he's not into black chicks okay oh yeah I want to marry oh

[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:17.660]
Jay I want to get near him I want to sniff it just one time nothing like a gag right there at

[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:21.320]
dinner time at the track to right in the middle of my dinner so let me speak for just about

[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:26.320]
everybody other than a few misguided hormonal bitches who couldn't get laid in a cucumber patch

[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:30.600]
we don't want you here okay oh Jay we got enough problems we got the damn pope coming to Cuba

[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:36.680]
that's close enough tomorrow we got enough problems with that go the hell away and don't come back soon

[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:42.260]
and there was Richmond Webb number 78 oh it's number 78 holding holding you have the man who's

[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:45.480]
committed more penalties for the dolphins in the last three years then all the other people on

[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:49.620]
the team put together including keep Sims he's gone and there he was there at this charity

[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:54.100]
golf event oh you know we got to let move on and it's for a good cause and pop pop pop pop yeah

[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:59.580]
right whatever you say okay Richmond 15 yards number 78 sorry so he won't go away and you know

[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:04.060]
who else won't go away is that god damn Oprah she just won't have to away now she you know what

[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:09.440]
that she reminds me of on a much more sinister scale because there are some people who realize what

[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:14.040]
a scumbag Larry King is there a lot of people who understand that uh-huh especially people he

[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:18.080]
still owes money to but he's dangerous like when he brought Ross P. Rowell on there and he made

[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:22.780]
him into a you know like a real presidential candidate single handedly nobody knew from Ross

[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:27.760]
Perot hilarious he decided he was going to play uh you know mr. Hatchout maker but Oprah's on

[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:31.920]
there and of course she's got this captive audience of millions of desperate board housewives

[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:37.000]
who are like in between Jerry Springer in between the hyperventilating housewives with no lives

[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:43.520]
and uh tapioca putting somewhere in between there is Oprah worth billions of dollars with the B

[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:49.040]
why i haven't got the foggiest idea a woman who has got nothing to say a woman who brings nothing

[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:53.420]
to the table a woman who is not interesting who is not brilliant who is not articulate who is not

[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:58.940]
anything other than lc the board and cow on a bad day why says girlfriend you okay girlfriend

[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:04.160]
as you're not the one that started that is she instrumental well yeah i've heard the instrumental

[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:08.920]
of vocals a lot better but the instrumental wasn't bad but at any rate so there she is and she's

[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:13.260]
in this battle now and you know i hate to say this but i have to take her side on this issue the

[01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:18.620]
thing about the beef but because thirteen states including texas and florida by the way have passed

[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:25.760]
these laws that you can't if you go on here and you maliciously attack a product and you cost in

[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:30.120]
other words they can prove that you cost them millions of dollars a substantial amount of money and

[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:33.920]
the question your motive is if you haven't done it just because you're stupid now in her case i

[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:37.880]
think just because she's stupid is evident but the beef industry's got a beef in fact they ought to

[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:42.700]
be on thursday with a morning thing but at any rate they passed these repressive unconstitutional

[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:47.660]
laws and mark my word they will be found to be unconstitutional so that if you go on here and you say

[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:51.340]
these give your opinion and people all of a sudden whether it's about beef and people stop going

[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:55.900]
out needing beef and across the millions of dollars while you're too bad you're so well and so

[01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:59.780]
they're having this big lawsuit they're suing opa for thirteen million dollars which is like pocket

[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:04.480]
change to that bitch and it really pains me that i have to take her side on this because she happens

[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:10.980]
to be right if she had some vegetarian former beef guy on her show last year two years ago and the

[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:16.360]
guy was talking about how they feed cows ground up disease you know they ground up uh...

[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:22.040]
cattle this is a dead animal's uh... excrement like they put in dog food yeah sounds tasty to me

[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:26.880]
in addition to which whatever goes in comes out pretty much uh... all the same way anyway right

[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:31.880]
what goes in must come out that's what Peter North says so what the hell is wrong with that

[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:35.980]
and we don't have no mad cow disease this country so they the bottom line is she evidently got

[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:40.080]
a lot of her housewives all bet out of shape the ones who weren't buying these tapioca putting

[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:44.200]
books that she's always promoting on their god i wish to how i was on her for like one day

[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:48.300]

day she weighed three hundred pounds six days later she weighed seventy five pounds on opa fast

[01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:08.200]
and then of course people went on that diet and they were croaking left and right i'm surprised

[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:12.360]
she never got an offend thing she's like a human accordion one day she weighs three hundred

[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:15.860]
next day she weighs thirty pounds she's like in between care and carpenter and monocass

[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:44.060]

[01:31:44.060 --> 01:32:14.040]
The purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting higher, the purpose getting

again

[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:36.400]
control that you've got to have that old rhythm and you gotta be saying I got to

[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:39.300]
rhythm that's the only one that's acceptable and obviously it's working really

[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:41.660]
great in all those third world countries where the reproducing like

[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:45.320]
rabbits like cockroaches and you can be sure he's going to be peddling that

[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:49.200]
same stone age garbage in Havana tomorrow and everywhere he goes around the

[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:53.140]
world as they continue perpetuating the misery and suffering of overpopulation

[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:56.300]
all over the world that's the one thing they do better than anything else

[01:32:56.300 --> 01:33:00.260]
beside brainwashing is perpetuate misery starvation and suffering and it's

[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:03.340]
interesting when you are in Rome by the way the only people over there at the

[01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:07.320]
Vatican are the geckys these sluppers who come on their hands and knees and

[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:10.180]
then of course the tourists to go over there and they buy the crosses and all

[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:15.080]
the other the trinkets the souvenirs I hate to tell you this but the Jews on

[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:19.760]
the souvenir shops here's Coral Springs hello good morning you all when it's

[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:23.840]
this thank you very much and you George for a great show yesterday oh thank God

[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:26.680]
somebody heard that I thought we'd get flooded today with people saying boy we

[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:30.460]
sure enjoyed that let's do it again soon like maybe today it was a great gift

[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:35.280]
and I appreciate it well you're welcome about the Pope I don't know if you saw

[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:39.840]
the Washington Post or any paper back in November when the Pope talked to a

[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:45.160]
Vatican Council and condemn the actions of Christians before and during the

[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:49.220]
Holocaust he told the Vatican Conference the Christian world contributed to the

[01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:53.460]
rise anti-Semitism and then failed to fight it as the Jews were being slaughtered

[01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:57.580]
during World War II right he came very very close to issuing an apology for the

[01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:02.160]
actions of Pope Pius close but not cigar and I believe this is next step and

[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:06.760]
that's what's interesting about this Pope I don't see him I have no

[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:13.760]
affection for organized religion and I agree with you about most of it I'm not

[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:18.060]
exactly sure about a supreme being I'm still wondering about it but my mind is

[01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:22.760]
open one way or the other well it's interesting about this what is interesting

[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:26.560]
about this man in a skirt well it's interesting about him is that he is being

[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:34.340]
used politically as a way of undermining Castro and let me ask you this how is

[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:38.240]
he undermining Castro in other words when he leaves Cuba in a couple of days

[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:42.260]
are you suggesting to me the Castro is going to fall or that's somehow his

[01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:45.600]
power base there is going to disappear oh no no no no no no you know he's

[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:48.860]
better one thing Castro and you know what we're doing than the church even is

[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:52.780]
indoctrinating in brainwashing and he's got those Cubans over there so brainwashed

[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:55.700]
that other than El Duque and a few baseball players they think they're living

[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:58.800]
in the life of Riley they're happy as a pig and slop and they love Fidel oh

[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:03.120]
no I'm not suggesting he's going to contribute to Castro so how is he

[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:09.500]
undermining him he's allowing some of the dissidents in Cuba the courage to

[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:13.880]
maybe speak out a little more and that's it's very important to me yeah I

[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:20.420]
understand that but this is probably his main contribution to his visit to

[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:25.340]
Cuba well I understand it's very critical back in he paused in Roman and

[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:30.300]
understand in by the way about and let me let me ask you this what business does

[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:35.200]
this man since he's a member of a religious I was gonna say cult a organized

[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:39.760]
religion but it is a cult since he is the leader the titular leader if I can

[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:42.880]
say that what business does he have running around the world telling people

[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:45.500]
about foreign policy and what they should do and what they shouldn't do in

[01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:50.320]
criticizing capitalism and who now cares what he thinks I'll be a lot of

[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:54.080]
those people who are his sheep okay a lot of people care about what he thinks

[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:57.480]
if nobody cared about what he thought you wouldn't be doing well let me ask

[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:01.280]
you this how come 97% of the people in Italy don't go to church well yeah but

[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:06.640]
it doesn't mean they don't identify as Catholics you see no no no let me say

[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:10.960]
that if you ever been to Rome have you ever been to Rome yes I have but let me

[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:15.200]
tell you this it's like 97% of the people in Israel don't go to synagogue but

[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:18.880]
they identify as being Jews it's the same thing it's a cultural there's a

[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:23.040]
difference there's a difference between being Catholic as in being born

[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:27.280]
Catholic and as you say identifying with a man who's preaching Stone Age

[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:31.300]
garbage when the Pope told him that that divorce was illegal they passed

[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:34.620]
along Italy allowing divorce when he told him that abortion was

[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:38.440]
absolutely a sin guess what they have abortions all over Italy it's legal in

[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:42.160]
Italy okay I'm saying that people identify with him more culturally what

[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:46.520]
does that mean they don't need him to eat pasta call what does culturally mean

[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:50.660]
he's both exactly they don't know kill Boston and where I've been in Italy well

[01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:55.160]
I you know I it's just a thought of mine I you're probably right but I just

[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:58.740]
wanted a I'm not going to try to pull words in your mouth or anything else and

[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:01.620]
I you know I mean everybody's entitled to opinion I'm more than happy to hear

[01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:05.300]
however let me it seems to me that you're making an attempt maybe you're trying

[01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:09.200]
too hard to be a nice guy and you're making an attempt to make a case for this

[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:13.060]
man where there isn't any there's no case there that's the problem to you by the

[01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:19.120]
way when you're when I'm on hold yeah during the break your conversation or

[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:22.620]
George's conversation with you came over the phone of course it was very

[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:27.080]
interesting I would be interested to hear what it was at nine years old that

[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:30.680]
George had the certificate that he was talking about no Georgia at the nine

[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:34.420]
years old realize it was all a bunch of bull crap and said to screw this well have

[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:38.420]
it a pal you two and God bless you see they like and that's another reason to

[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:41.440]
call you can your George Hocken a giant pop up up up up up I believe me he does

[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:44.980]
he does his own show to me which like I said it's preaching the choir I'm the

[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:47.960]
captive audience here but he has to get it off his little chest here's for

[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:53.440]
a lot of day hello how you don't sir okay do you remember saying did you know

[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:57.700]
you can't hear you too well yeah that's better did God create man or did man

who are chasing after the Israel and how come how about this El Nino business I

[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:41.740]
talked about this year today El Nino here's the Christ child and he's screwing

[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:44.520]
up the weather and people are dying and freezing that thanks to the Christ

[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:47.560]

[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:55.220]

[01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:58.100]
webber to heli's hide in these days or on the side of that bank building

[01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:01.440]
though it's you know I know that a lot of people in this audience get very

[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:04.500]
antsy and they think I do too much of this the real thing is I don't do

[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:08.420]
enough of it that's the thing I am so sick and tired of a media and an entire

[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:12.560]
other than maybe you know a screw magazine which is our good pornographer

[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:17.420]
Fred Al Goldstein and a few pornographic publications which of course most

[01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:21.100]
people discard because if it's a sexual nature then obviously you're going to

[01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:23.620]
go to hell anyway for looking at it or reading it but let's see what's in it

[01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:27.340]
please but other than that there is nobody in this goddamn country that's got

[01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:30.400]
the balls to come out and talk about me here this Pope thing is a classic

[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:34.640]
example where's the other side of this where's even the other side in this

[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:37.800]
community which you'd expect to see this big conflict well you know with a

[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:40.800]
Cubans about well on the one hand as much as they didn't brainwashed and

[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:43.180]
they're good obedient Catholics and they bring them into church and put it

[01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:45.660]
in a plate every Sunday and they stick that wafer in their mouth and whatever

[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:49.220]
else looks good in spite of all that here's this guy coming consorting with

[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:52.560]
Fidel who is like the devil incarnate I mean this son of a bitch Fidel he

[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:56.060]
liked poison and with good reason okay and so they've got this tremendous

[01:39:56.060 --> 01:40:00.460]
conflict and in this community man they've managed to like shove all this under

[01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:03.580]
the carpet they've covered it all up and the entire media here are covering

[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:07.520]
this thing like it's the second coming of Yoschke and Joseph Smith and

[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:10.780]
Abraham and Abraham Solomon I mean it's just unbelievable you think

[01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:14.280]
this was the greatest thing that since they invented the a popsicle for Christ

[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:18.380]
sakes what's so great about it oh and in that of course I remember years ago when

[01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:21.580]
he was here what was that about the ten eleven it was eleven years ago because

[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:26.740]
that was an I and Z oh my god and they had and guess who was the MC you'll never

[01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:32.680]
guess this Gregory Benjamin Vudelle was the MC of this parade thing they had

[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:36.540]
downtown for El Papa a man who keeps asking the question is there anybody out

[01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:40.040]
there who doesn't hate me like poison Gregory Vudelle a man who does more radio

[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:43.440]
jobs in six months than most of us have ever done in a lifetime and this man

[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:47.000]
was their MC and no god that's good et cetera and so there's a guy who's been

[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.980]
well adjusted from his Catholic upbringing right?

[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:52.740]
Yo baby that's what it's all about and like Madeline Muriel here that

[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:57.360]
bitch where is she by the way whatever it is she said without hell religion

[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:01.120]
isn't worth a damn and that's right without the fear of being punished without

[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:05.020]
the fear of not having eternal life which is the most ridiculous thing if like

[01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:08.840]
OJ said oh when you know you're up there to purly gate the man get up that at

[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:12.300]
the purly gate if he was so worried about the purly gates he wouldn't the

[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:15.300]
give off those two people like you know in a fit of passion that he would

[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:20.200]
fifth off man worried about the goddamn purly gates my ass this is such

[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:24.860]
garbage such nonsense such sputum man and like I've said so many times and I'll

[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:29.040]
keep saying as long as I got a breath in this old pathetic baggy body am I if

[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:32.520]
they spent like one tenth of the money and energy that they do on brainwashing

[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:35.460]
the world with this horse crap to try to solve the problems that are out there

[01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:38.480]
and feed the people who are starving to death including that poor old bag

[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:41.460]
mother to recent I grant you you know she may have never stolen a freight

[01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:45.020]
ring and she was wrinkled up and disgusting an old and probably smell bad and

[01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:48.380]
nobody cared because she chose the wrong kind of croak when Diana did but in the

[01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:51.820]
meantime she was running around the world peddling the same crap a horse ball and

[01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:54.860]
if they would have just sold all the all the artwork they got in the Vatican they

[01:41:54.860 --> 01:41:59.480]
have enough money to feed all the starving people billions billions and billions

[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:03.480]
with a B and if they had all the money that was ripped off in a Vatican bank

[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:06.880]
scandal they'd have all that much more money they could all be driving the

[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:09.900]
least little brown toyot as any well at least lepers even in places where they

[01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:12.700]
don't have any roads yet they were showing yesterday speaking of Martin Luther

[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:16.120]
King they were showing some of these revival thing to some of these oh my god

[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:19.840]
what is that all about it's like something out of a Tennessee Williams play I

[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:22.400]
mean these people are like rocket and rolling and they're rolling around on the

[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:25.080]
floor and the spirit is getting too many speaking in tongues and they're rolling

[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:29.040]
around on each other oh god that's good I mean talk about St. Vite is dance talk

[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:32.080]
about watching people who look like they have gone totally mentally like it's

[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:35.660]
time to get the butterfly in and out boys and girls three times a week at

[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:39.740]
that assembly of Godchurch right by your house oh yeah they'd be thinking in

[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:44.700]
tongue all right and he's going let me just lay it out to you and I want I really

[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:49.860]
would challenge anybody to debate this since the Cubans in Cuba have lived

[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:55.220]
under Castro and communism for almost 40 years now since 1959 and since

[01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:59.600]
virtually all of those people have been brought up without religion they're

[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:03.940]
their economic prisoners of Castro's regime is what they are political and

[01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:06.920]
economic because they can't express at the center point of view but if they had

[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:10.120]
if they had food if they had a decent lifestyle they wouldn't give a crap they

[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:13.900]
don't care about communist stuff they don't care about the capitalism they don't

[01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:16.980]
care about religion any of that if they just could like you know get their

[01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:20.300]
food and their medicines and whatever they need to live like human beings that's

[01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:24.160]
what they care about now unless I'm a staking unless the news media have missed

[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:28.260]
something drastic here and I don't think they have because they've covered this

[01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:32.120]
thing everything from the Pope's fingernails to his rectum everything in

[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:35.220]
between we've had great great details most of which we don't need to hear about

[01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:41.180]
all of it so unless I'm missing something he isn't bringing truck loads and

[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:44.780]
truck loads and plane loads of cargo be hard to bring the trucks I guess plane

[01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:48.560]
loads of all this good stuff to feed the people to bring their medicine to

[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:51.940]
bring all these things which they are desperately being deprived of or what

[01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:55.820]
they'll not because he's wing it they don't have time for that he's busy

[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:58.860]
collecting money from the getch keys we're gonna come under hand in these just

[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:02.080]
like they've been for years all over Latin America and all these slepherds

[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:06.480]
bringing their flats view pesos all pop up all pop up for whatever you know

[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:11.200]
alpapa no la pop up alpapa would be for a real man I would say an alpapa up

[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:14.040]
until this moment but now let's at least be honest about it what kind of a man

[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:17.700]
wears a dress even guys that run around and drag dress better than that even

[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:21.280]
Eddie Murphy would be embarrassed by that okay what kind of a skirt pot you know

[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:25.580]
what I'm saying kind of crap is that and you see all this archaic stuff in

[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:29.480]
their running around with the with all those I still wonder what they call it a

[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:32.400]
miter don't they that big thing that they're schlepping and with those things

[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:35.760]
those hoods on their head I thought only the clansman wore hoods on their head

[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:38.760]
and then he was a little rounder they ripped off the beanie from the Jews of

[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:41.980]
course they had a rip off everything from the Jews because we came first and he's

[01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:46.000]
got his little ugly beanie there and oh it's a big cynic and he's coming

[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.420]
there but is he gonna always gonna take care of their spiritual needs what the

[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:53.200]
hell does that mean what a rationalization for the fact that he's not gonna come

[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:55.800]
there into a goddamn thing about the real problems of these people are

[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:59.100]
suffering from he's not gonna free them politically he's not gonna feed them

[01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:01.940]
he's not gonna take care of their health and medical needs he's not gonna do a

[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:04.860]
damn thing except do another big publicity stuff so we can keep the Vatican

[01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:09.060]
going and he has something if they took a if they took a vote see Italy is not

[01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:11.980]
like England where they're like tied with a monarchy where they're all

[01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:15.900]
emotionally involved because they're emotional cripples and Italy they'd like

[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:18.800]
to say baffan gula to the whole Vatican a whole bunch of those go and they

[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:22.540]
don't have any need for them in fact they would like to stop being see the Vatican

[01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:25.600]
gets pissed off and so every now and then they come along along with the

[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:31.320]
police and they like close up all the adult establishments and clubs and bars

[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:34.220]
where people might be having a good time because they want to suppress the

[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:37.760]
people and control them as much as possible that's what the Vatican that's the

[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:40.440]
purpose they serve in Italy and they by the way they don't do a very good job

[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:43.600]
because like five days later they all reopen again all the gay bars we have to

[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:46.420]
shut down them because the fags are in there including a lot of the priest of

[01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:49.600]
the bathhouse don't have a good time there and they do but if you ask the

[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:52.360]
majority of the people they need them like they need hemorrhids and believe

[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:55.280]
me as an expert on that subject we don't none of us need that

[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:00.400]

[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:16.500]

[01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:10.900]
they can come on the one dot kind of which one is that is that the AJ that

[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:14.720]
looks like the ax murder how you doing the backseat boys are really now AJ is

[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:19.540]
the one with the tattoos or that your AJ and this is Kevin see it now it's a

[01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:23.080]
mirror do they know who you guys were upstairs at power 96 they didn't know who

[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:25.980]
you are but like individually they know who you were we haven't been on there yet

[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:29.780]
well they don't have any idea who you guys are I mean I got that's a mic that

[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:34.140]
might even work Kevin now where's the rest of the guys worth Nick and Brian

[01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:37.400]
and the gods of miss Bo other upstairs getting ready to go on air well they're

[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:42.780]
gonna go up there yeah well that's great that's that's a good stuff now I want

[01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:46.080]
to ask you one thing because you know you notice this I'm not some novice

[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:49.140]
with you guys okay I mean just because I'm an old aging bag doesn't mean that

[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:52.680]
those seriously well what's what's wrong with that I mean we can't all be

[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:56.060]
perfect but when I was in Amsterdam I brought you around because I saw you guys

[01:49:56.060 --> 01:49:59.140]
videos which these guys are how come you guys are big all over the world first

[01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:02.560]
and then you like marketing here what's what they're that by accident is that

[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:06.600]
like on purpose I guess this is destiny it just sort of happened that way so

[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:10.520]
what do you know now what's a new single gotta be actually back well that's

[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:13.600]
gonna be the single now is that a change because when you want much music I

[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:16.260]
thought there was another let's see which ones on here are singles I'll never

[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:20.920]
break your heart was that a single in Europe in Europe I'm confused I can't

[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:26.020]
handle this because I don't like you're a new at the album yeah is a compilation

[01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:31.300]
of some of the hits and sing is basically all the all the singles off the first

[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:35.160]
European album we put on the first US album with a couple of new tracks that's

[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:40.000]
basically with the US album right so the the next single here in the US will be

[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.240]
back streets back and then after that it'll either be we feel like we have

[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:48.620]
three more possible singles off the US album that we can go with so unbelievable

[01:50:48.620 --> 01:50:51.720]
now where were you guys you said you went over to England and did the album over

[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:55.940]
there and where else in have you been we've been all over the world the only place

[01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:59.780]
we haven't been yet at South America but basically we've covered you gotta learn

[01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:03.200]
that's why that's why I came down here to ask by new for you and Amsterdam

[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:07.080]
yes yeah that's a great city and what is that you like to Amsterdam

[01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:11.020]
definitely now you have to keep do you have to keep along with you guys and

[01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:16.920]
that's what everybody wonders because you know you read the liner notes and

[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:19.900]
it's a very religious upbringing and background even though you know talking

[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:23.740]
with heathen bastard like me but we know I mean we don't claim to be perfect

[01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:29.180]
but now what does that mean you don't have to be perfect are you like leading a

[01:51:29.180 --> 01:51:32.040]
little door open there for some of these screaming we're not trying to preach

[01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:35.480]
to anybody that we're perfect because we make mistakes just like everybody else

[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:39.200]
but we you know we that's our background that's our upbringing that's the way

[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:42.400]
our parents brought us up now what does that mean I mean you screw around a little

[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:46.360]
on the side what is that they're gonna make their parents proud but still

[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:50.400]
have we try to we never let's try not to do anything that would you know

[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:53.340]
embarrass our families you know just try to make mom in other words you don't

[01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:55.040]
want to emulate Frank here for you don't want to know

[01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:00.580]
yeah but you guys are running around all over the world Amsterdam all these

[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:05.380]
heathen places Toronto and there's all these screaming girls my mom 18 year old

[01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:09.280]
girls and your mom is back in Orlando right yeah my mom answered them in the

[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:15.900]
red light district she probably think it was the gates of hell yeah I kind of

[01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:19.740]
thought it was the gates of heaven myself and I think you guys might agree

[01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:23.780]
based on what kind of when we were there our first night there are our record

[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:27.560]
company the guy from the the rep from the record coming took us for a walk

[01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:31.300]
down the red light district and we're just we could believe it yeah oh my

[01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:35.060]
gosh yeah the leader but you Europe is different though you like you say

[01:52:35.060 --> 01:52:38.340]
Toronto is a great city Toronto is different from this country too I think

[01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:42.860]
Europe is just more laid back about things and not as conservative on the

[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:47.480]
views I think the teenagers get responsibility at a lot younger age I think

[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:53.120]
that sex education is a lot better in Europe and I think they give their

[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:57.100]
teams more responsibility at an earlier age they're not immature in juvenile

[01:52:57.100 --> 01:53:00.800]
like we are in a hurry and they travel all over Europe on the trains and

[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:04.920]
they're the young people are very very mature there when you guys are really

[01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:07.760]
kicking ass and I appreciate your coming down to the other guys that have to

[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:10.960]
hang upstairs and pang and the kind of the concert by the way is they can

[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:14.300]
bring them down here of course everybody's after Nick everybody night is he

[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:18.000]

the group there's five guys and he like stands out everybody's screaming

the real Roger show now on five sixty wqa m Miami Fort Lauderdale I can't believe what just

[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:12.620]
happened did you hear that did you hear the way that that music was fading and the ID still

[01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:16.560]
played over at George not but I want to get the audience involved in technical I can't believe

[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:20.900]
that that works that it's set up to do that yeah it is it's great oh and everybody think

[01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:26.520]
yeah an obsolete machine what the BTS they're going audio vault everywhere I got news for the audio

[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:32.240]
vault is a piece of compare to the compare to anything the audio vault is uh for commercials it's fine

[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:37.240]
right it's okay not great in fact even this would be this isn't a lot of places use this first

[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:40.820]
five remember we used to have all the spots from other post in the hot air that's where the

[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:45.320]
problem arises it doesn't interface well with the traffic computer system they were having

[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:49.880]
problems over there it happens to a lot of the dcs well like I said let's let the commercial

[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:54.260]
deal with the audio vault which is a piece of garbage and we'll take our dcs here thank you

[01:57:54.260 --> 01:57:59.660]
very lucky I'm just blown away it's great by the way that that just I hit it like a second early

[01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:04.000]
it thought well maybe it'll chop the other thing off what who cares and it's just the music faded

[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:07.640]
out there and nobody in the audience really cares about this because i'm Q and there used to

[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:12.120]
uh oh well there used to that kind of sound from our car machine number five which by the way

[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:15.440]
if this company had any self-respect which they don't they would get rid of that

[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:18.280]
thing now they would blow it up right on here we'd have a party that's my

[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:22.180]
girl seriously this year your number one with this god forsaken company that's

[01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:26.180]
my goal is to embarrass them because you know those studios upstairs on a

[01:58:26.180 --> 01:58:29.800]
second floor i mean they even the uski will never live long enough to see those

[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:32.900]
on the the upstairs on the second floor on the eighth floor whatever the

[01:58:32.900 --> 01:58:36.780]
hell it is but the bottom line is at least at least put something in there so

[01:58:36.780 --> 01:58:38.760]
when somebody's commercials are playing on the yard

[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:39.400]
uh...

[01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:43.960]
you know somebody can understand what it is or at least we pretend that we

[01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:46.880]
care about doing something for their uh... hundred bucks or two hundred bucks

[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:50.420]
or five thousand bucks or whatever we're so good on that particular day now

[01:58:50.420 --> 01:58:51.940]
that we had a good book their ten grand

[01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:57.200]

technically supposed to be the payday is here at be easily read broadcasting

[01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:43.640]
and i will say that they have been very early with the paychecks now some of

[01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:46.480]
the other checks a little on the slow side but the paychecks have actually come

[01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:49.720]
early but it's kind of like at their women other words whenever we got a few

[01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:52.400]
bucks in the bank let's give them the check now and make sure it clears today

[01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:56.940]
so like the twenty fifth should be payday but the twenty fifth of sunday so

[01:59:56.940 --> 02:00:01.220]
any place that i've ever worked in my life when the payday is on a weekend day

[02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:05.100]
you always get your check the day before the weekend which this case will be

[02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:09.280]
friday the twenty third payday should be on friday but then uh... here's the

[02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:13.040]
best part for us as well if if the date comes on saturday then they pay on

[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:16.960]
friday but if it's here for the land on sunday then they do it on monday which is

[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:20.700]
the way of pushing it back just one more day can we postpone just one more day

hundred and fifty calls with directions oh here's how you get to the coralski amphitheater

[02:13:33.740 --> 02:13:39.720]

[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:46.820]
an umbrella maybe a poncho maybe all three of the above this thing is as open as uh canty willets

[02:13:46.820 --> 02:13:53.840]
it's as open as monica lawinski who that's right monica that's her monica the coralski amphitheater so

[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:59.240]
if they paid me a thousand dollars to go there again i wouldn't even think about it and now i'm

[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:03.280]
here and you know somebody called in yesterday oh i saw erosmith there was really great the acoustics

[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:07.760]
are great of course there was a forty five minute warmup show let me just tell you this okay the

[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:12.280]
backstreet boys were at the skydome in toronto they were made believe gardens in toronto they

[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:18.040]
performed at the biggest facilities all over the world they come to the coralski amphitheater erosmith

[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:23.140]
comes to the coralski amphitheater doesn't it rain like seventy percent of the days in the year

[02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:26.920]
and maybe more than that in florida isn't there and especially lately with uh everything that's

[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:30.980]
going on a chance that you're going to get soaked now all those young hysterical girls there they

[02:14:30.980 --> 02:14:35.600]
didn't care because they were already wet when they came in i but believe me soaked those hormones were

[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:40.320]
it made no difference the one sitting way in the back pneumonia city they don't care and the show

[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:44.820]
is great kids were great they do a great job they put on a tremendous show the acoustics in error

[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:51.160]
great but what kind of an effing places that coralski amphitheater i wouldn't take my dogs there

[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:56.720]
you know i think about these assholes that go to outdoor concerts and reminds me the last playoff

[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:00.760]
game that really sticks in my mind that i went to with the dolphin sandy igre game a few years ago

[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:07.200]
when it poured cats and dogs the entire game and the third quarter somebody finally passes me back

[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:11.560]
about a two dollar poncho and of course i'm sitting there at at that point i just gave up i

[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:15.460]
figured pneumonia city and i ever got a scratch in my throat for some miracle just like today i

[02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:19.940]
have no idea how i didn't even get a scratch in my throat either because the rain the wind is just

[02:15:19.940 --> 02:15:24.500]
blowing all of this rain in there like all over your head now the lake is forming at your feet

[02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:28.460]
and after they did the last song before the encore i said okay let's get out of here we make a

[02:15:28.460 --> 02:15:32.380]
run for it got got about halfway towards the back because you get from what he seats you can't go

[02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:36.340]
up the frontway oh no you can't get through there you got to go all the way to the back and around

[02:15:36.340 --> 02:15:40.300]
all the seating for the parking lot out there in the middle of the pasture but go into the buffalo

[02:15:40.300 --> 02:15:45.580]
the buffalo raceway the hamburger and hampered new york it's a cow pasture which is nothing wrong

[02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:49.800]
with the county fair i mean it's fine everybody likes pigs and chickens and they there were plenty of

[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:54.080]
pigs there i would say there was like 90 percent teenage girls there there was about 5 percent

[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:58.240]
guys and then there was a few queens and so when i finally there's this 15 minute intermission

[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:03.140]
between these waste of time 45 minute warm-up bags and when the back street boys come out so now

[02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:06.660]
i figured well i got to go take a leak this is a great time so i go back there and i'm walking out

[02:16:06.660 --> 02:16:11.220]
and of course now the rain is coming and i get to the back of the thing and i start walking

[02:16:11.220 --> 02:16:15.880]
away and i hear some oh i just can't wait to see those five beautiful boys some queen but some

[02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:21.120]
screamer back there some screaming queen and at that point i wish i would have had like a poncho

[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:25.880]
just to put over my head and shame like what is this bag it doing here okay i mean let butch

[02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:30.940]

[02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:35.520]
nick will be 18 for three more days okay so put it away sweetie you like a great cigar i sure do

[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:39.540]

[02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:43.300]
wants to be a much a woman whatever next is the place to go to get your great cigars it's

[02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:44.300]
me now

[02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:57.520]
i like girls almost have a little bit trapped inside

[02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:01.640]
i get girls

[02:17:03.860 --> 02:17:06.980]
cause after president has a little on the side

[02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:18.760]
but it's a bad situation when the leader of the nation gets his kicks from doing it with ugly

[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:28.460]
chips now it's not a good situation to have it with a resignation cause my problem is i can't

[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:31.400]
dismiss i do girl

[02:17:33.540 --> 02:17:36.820]

[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:41.140]
lots of girls

[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:46.540]
kind of like jack candy but he has better eyesight

[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:56.420]
what you see it's a bad situation unlike the Kennedy administration who went for starlit

[02:17:56.420 --> 02:18:03.120]
days as opposed to my repulsive days and as the leader of this nation the badgered

[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:12.380]
my frustration they had my role and i get a broad with the bad nose not a good situation if

[02:18:12.380 --> 02:18:20.440]
i have to end it with my resignation cause i can't even have an idiot and then of course we

[02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:25.020]
got this Clinton crafted deal with now the guy just cannot keep it in his pants which nobody

[02:18:25.020 --> 02:18:30.580]
nobody cares about that nobody cares but why so many lies this is going to be the worst thing

[02:18:30.580 --> 02:18:35.860]
here should you know who say this in over there now just rubbing his chemical weapons together now

[02:18:35.860 --> 02:18:40.720]
just having a great time because now this obfuscates everything even that's crazy old man with

[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:45.080]
a dress down there in Cuba that go takes a on the back burner there he has Santa Clara Cuba

[02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:50.120]

[02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:59.440]

[02:19:10.740 --> 02:19:15.560]
to injury after driving home soaking wet from this nightmare experience one of the worst night

[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:20.560]
probably the worst experience of my life here's a mobile in del Rey hello yeah Neil searching for

[02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:25.980]
a living human being yes yes I am I just turned it late there this morning talking about the

[02:19:27.060 --> 02:19:32.380]
coralskayanthetheta what a nightmare a nightmare also the you're talking about the auditorium and one

[02:19:32.380 --> 02:19:39.200]
of the reasons I know auditorium anymore is with sold to the guys in the in the bicycles and the

[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:50.540]
white shirts and the long pants that right around and tell you to stop at the doors the hope of

[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:55.340]
they let the wrestling is going to be out soon and then there's no more there no purple palace yeah

[02:19:55.340 --> 02:20:00.420]
right and the other thing this is a joke the other thing on the coralskaya one of the guys with

[02:20:00.420 --> 02:20:08.420]
a finger in it so to speak is mr. high finger oh no that's him oh oh my god no you know just to show

[02:20:08.420 --> 02:20:17.380]
you you were right there producing it you know what I'm saying what he's doing right he's even one

[02:20:17.380 --> 02:20:21.560]
of the founding fathers of that thing and then help get put it together and still as far as I've

[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:25.840]
heard some close people is that he still has a little finger in it he has his finger in it huh

[02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:30.300]
that's right yeah mr. high finger involved in the whole thing that that answers everything I need to know

[02:20:30.300 --> 02:20:34.160]
here you go in closing can I suck up from one of the t-shirt sure no problem hang on especially

[02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:39.500]
after all that good info after the lowdown online six take that even what's your name Monica Lewinsky

[02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:43.700]
never got screwed like that although she says she did well maybe she can compare notes with Paula

[02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:47.320]
and of course now he admits that he did Jennifer flowers even though he lied about it but in

[02:20:47.320 --> 02:20:52.640]
his deposition he said yeah I did her we don't care if you can't keep it in your pants just don't lie

[02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:56.420]
about it in fact what they should do is just have him come on there and with the pictures of all

[02:20:56.420 --> 02:21:02.840]
these broads he's done and I think he probably is rating up to 20% he get a 90 share easy put that

[02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:09.220]
JFK in his place always already in his place but they can't find the brain key wise tello yes yes

[02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:15.680]
sir Neil yes I am yeah what's wrong with having a horny president nothing wrong with that

[02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:23.560]
after all wasn't Kennedy a pretty horny fellow Kennedy was he was horny 24 hours a day well yeah

[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:30.080]
well but in his case they ran in the family well that's okay I mean and Nixon had his Chinese

[02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:35.620]
mistress did he yeah I didn't know about that and Roosevelt had his mistress and of course remember

[02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:43.320]
Nelson Rockefeller he had he was happy oh really yeah what was a gate he was gay but not happy

[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:48.480]
he was happy but not gay something like that well anyway I think that Paula Jones is a

[02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:53.500]
a fucking bitch okay that was good he said Paula is a tramp but he said she's an f and bitch that was

[02:21:53.500 --> 02:21:58.240]
nice that was very nicer if you're gonna say a fucking bit at least put a little bleep in it okay you

[02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:02.380]
idiot you foul mouth old fart he just jealous that's all this old fart he hasn't gotten any in 20

[02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:07.780]
years and like I said 40 years yeah we got some real tourists coming folks we got some real tourists

[02:22:07.780 --> 02:22:12.540]
coming because it's not just a hanky-panky but it's the obstruction of justice again just like in

[02:22:12.540 --> 02:22:16.680]
Watergate it wasn't a little break in there nobody gave a crap about Litty and all those hunt all

[02:22:16.680 --> 02:22:21.040]
those idiots with that break in at the Watergate complex with a third-rate bushed robbery not too

[02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:25.080]
many people got real excited about that because we know all about dirty tricks and politics but we

[02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:28.660]
not only have dirty tricks we have dirty dick and if you know anything about hygiene that's not a

[02:22:28.660 --> 02:22:33.220]
good way to go which is probably why a lot of guys washed their hands after they take a leak I'm

[02:22:33.220 --> 02:22:37.520]
gonna say it again for the million times how about taking a washing your hands before you take a leak

[02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:42.540]
treat it with respect like the guy said like the violin teacher said and fame whatever the

[02:22:42.540 --> 02:22:47.960]
hell he was teaching he said handle your bowl respect like your f*** is what he said hey anyway here's

[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:53.080]
another Arkansas governor with national political ass as aspirations aspirations questions of

[02:22:53.080 --> 02:22:57.720]
character and ethics at a crucial point in his career republican mike huckabee a Baptist preacher

[02:22:57.720 --> 02:23:02.240]
who has written the book title character is the issue is accused of pocketing campaign money

[02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:08.160]
hiding sources outside income how do you like that another good old boy from Arkansas the greatest

[02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:12.840]
the quote in here newsweek magazine reported listen to some of the excerpts of these tapes you know

[02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:17.360]
that they're all excited about in which Lewinsky this is Monica Lewinsky and by the way another pig

[02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:22.500]
you know I mean can he doesn't somebody want to get the president so eyeglasses between Paula Jones

[02:23:22.500 --> 02:23:27.480]
and this Monica Lewinsky which sounds kind of like a Polish last Jewish to me anyway they reported

[02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:32.060]
they listen to some of the excerpts and in which he report purportedly say she planned a lie about

[02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:37.740]
her relationship with Clinton if deposed in the Paula Jones case now listen to this quote I will deny

[02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:42.280]
it so he will not get screwed in the case but I'm going to get screwed personally the magazine quoted

[02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:45.440]
the young woman is saying on the tape don't you think it's a little late for it to realize that

[02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:50.120]
now that she's going to get screwed as in past tense she did get screwed she's going to get screwed and

[02:23:50.120 --> 02:23:54.660]
the she's who's the screw and who's the screwy I think they're all screwy if he acts may they're all

better idea you'll come to Rome with the me no let's go to Amsterdam together but not for food now

[02:41:05.980 --> 02:41:11.800]
see what are you doing herring what are you doing Jesus God the food in Amsterdam is the worst you

[02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:15.660]
better you better be in training ready for a lot of sex because the food there either sexer

[02:41:15.660 --> 02:41:20.420]
drugs are both because the food there I ate and I told us on here I ate most of my meals

[02:41:20.420 --> 02:41:24.480]
and McDonald's I was doing the atkins I threw away the buns I would stand and they don't even look

[02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:28.240]
at you you know like in Amsterdam nobody cares what you're doing or and so you throw away the

[02:41:28.240 --> 02:41:31.760]
bun you're standing with a wax paper around the meat and you just got meat in your mouth which you

[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:36.000]
do a lot in Amsterdam anyway and and that was it that was the highlight was eating the McDonald's

[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:40.220]
which anywhere else in the world I would never go near there but that's as good as it gets in Amsterdam

[02:41:40.220 --> 02:41:44.280]
mediocre food not into the Asian plates the foods pouring we would bring

[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:48.060]
and the Chinese food man I'm going to tell you something just stay away unless you want

[02:41:48.460 --> 02:41:51.120]
grotesque hemorrhoids that I want to say there's in the middle of your no have a multiple of

[02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:54.500]
food all in your case it won't make any difference but that's that's three and a half months I

[02:41:54.500 --> 02:41:57.700]
suffered until I finally got rid of hemorrhoids from eating Chinese food in Amsterdam

[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:02.880]
they put enough pepper and enough spices and enough MSG it's on but because they figure everybody

[02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:06.960]
stoneed anyway they won't know the difference but I'm thrilled you love it because it's a great

[02:42:06.960 --> 02:42:10.900]

[02:43:13.140 --> 02:43:18.880]
is this issue before is this pre-the Pope uh yeah I didn't even do the pope you didn't do the

[02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:22.240]
pope you know I didn't think of this we don't then I think that even the pope a granite village

[02:43:22.240 --> 02:43:28.380]
no but you know it's it's so boring at the politicians and the news it's all they took away

[02:43:28.380 --> 02:43:35.260]
is Miami and the fascist Cubans who left these George is a liberal but I hate I hate these

[02:43:35.260 --> 02:43:40.040]
expatriates who have left for Dell and and none of them ever defend the Pateesta they want to

[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:44.980]
benefit Dell except for Pateesta and all they want is their property back but they ripped

[02:43:44.980 --> 02:43:49.940]
towards everyone else at the point of Pateesta 90 percent of the country was the literate why would

[02:43:49.940 --> 02:43:53.580]
they rip the tea so they were buddies with the tea that's right because he gave them things and

[02:43:53.580 --> 02:43:59.360]
they are I mean they are the ultimate who is the Cuban community I believe that and if they

[02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:03.920]
roll us a go for me I understand if they put a cat tail in it but they are gross people

[02:44:04.620 --> 02:44:11.700]
they blow up museums they're anti-freedom they and then of course Clinton being the Pimpty is

[02:44:12.540 --> 02:44:19.300]
I mean I can't believe we're anti-Cuba China's alright Vietnam we have a war with and now we have

[02:44:19.300 --> 02:44:24.700]
an embassy we are a despicable country I mean I really want more think I'm going to live in

[02:44:24.700 --> 02:44:29.060]
Amsterdam permanently but you know something I'm not like what happened in Copenhagen look at

[02:44:29.060 --> 02:44:34.400]
how the rest of the world is becoming more uptight and more like this country and more sanitize the

[02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:39.740]
whole world is becoming sanitize no perverts like us around a business yeah but no we don't have

[02:44:39.740 --> 02:44:44.060]
in Copenhagen did you were you ever there I was there I remember Tivoli Gods I remember they

[02:44:44.060 --> 02:44:48.420]
not talking about Tivoli Gods long before I ever went to Copenhagen that was the capital of

[02:44:48.420 --> 02:44:52.840]
Canada that's right that's right and now it's like forget it like we had enough and we're not

[02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:57.280]
interested now we go to Tivoli Gardens and we march around and it's a little boring I mean talk

[02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:01.940]
about boring people are very nice but boring and Florida's always been the worst clothes and

[02:45:01.940 --> 02:45:06.880]
worried about topless clubs and stuff you know as well as I do an all your years of radio and all

[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:11.560]
your years of being in front of this microphone have you ever found the following statement not to

[02:45:11.560 --> 02:45:17.880]
be true the more moralistic the person is in public the more the hypocrite he is in private sure

[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:21.460]
and the more homophobic they are the more likely it is that the applause he wants to do it

[02:45:21.460 --> 02:45:25.040]
you'd be swag and I mean I know you don't like issues but whether it was Jimmy swag and a Jim

[02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:29.840]
Bake on my first arrest in many older the guy then went to jail three years later what about

[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:35.400]

[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:40.980]
inside addition there was a guy on TV six months ago a cop who would list the names of John

[02:45:40.980 --> 02:45:47.420]
to a busted he just got busted for corruption good it doesn't always happen it never fails

[02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:52.340]
that's the thing I hate about Clinton I mean you're right they're taste but he wants to

[02:45:52.340 --> 02:45:59.280]
worry about indecency on the internet selling penthouse at px's that low life I mean I'd

[02:45:59.280 --> 02:46:06.780]
loathe him because I just didn't have the trail he's so self-hating for his sexual excesses he

[02:46:06.780 --> 02:46:12.600]
doesn't want to have any of us have any fun but him he was all the ugly women from south I really

[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:16.280]
do hate but you do know the day is going to come maybe we want to see but the day will come that

[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:21.220]
somebody is going to have the balls to stand up and say what you just got through saying it'll

[02:46:21.220 --> 02:46:25.060]
come eventually I hope people say well wait a minute or something we don't care about these

[02:46:25.060 --> 02:46:30.140]
things it's all about your a bull crap it's all political a clap track because again just go

[02:46:30.140 --> 02:46:34.060]
the way but he cares how much he's screwing around nobody really cares if he had enough

[02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:38.980]
intelligence not to be lying about it not to be covering it up he's going to wind up with the

[02:46:38.980 --> 02:46:42.940]

that same old bump and grind then why not revisit an old friend and eat at the Y that's right folks

[02:48:55.360 --> 02:49:01.980]
because here at the Y we've turned our old facilities into a mouthwatering buffet and you've

[02:49:01.980 --> 02:49:07.280]

inverted at this point it is and it's actually it's bigger than George I mean I've heard of an

[02:50:16.860 --> 02:50:22.880]
ingrown toenail not maybe he's size but if it's really ingrown I could do myself no but I every

[02:50:22.880 --> 02:50:26.060]
woman I've interviewed I don't want to get wrong because I know you know that point of

[02:50:26.060 --> 02:50:32.120]
someone and plus the dump goes off too so don't be afraid of but every point of actress and I

[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:37.200]
interviewed them from mid-night balloon my show of 22 years I always get them who who is better

[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:41.680]
kindling this a man or a woman everyone never been an exception every woman is said a woman

[02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:48.360]
it's no surprise and I'm always amazed that if if my woman was with another woman I find

[02:50:48.360 --> 02:50:54.680]
that a turn on I will find a turn but if I said hey maybe you want to see me with a man

[02:50:54.680 --> 02:51:00.160]
she'd say oh no no no you're a faggot so we really accept bisexuality and women we love it as

[02:51:00.160 --> 02:51:06.920]
men but women don't like their men being gay because maybe I don't know what you say

[02:51:06.920 --> 02:51:12.140]
though the woman I know that's yeah well there must be a real a lot of unhappy women married to

[02:51:12.140 --> 02:51:17.340]
Cuban guys well they're the worst right because yeah because it's Cuban men are very high and

[02:51:17.340 --> 02:51:22.480]
and a titan men are almost all of them bisexual and of course the more they deny now titan men

[02:51:22.480 --> 02:51:26.660]
won't deny it they won't talk yeah yeah yeah right but Cuban will deny it vehemently and the more

[02:51:26.660 --> 02:51:30.960]
they deny it the more that means they are well if you look in the pages of screw you'll see all

[02:51:30.960 --> 02:51:36.860]
those transvestites and we call them chicks with dash you know pretty opt 98% of them

[02:51:36.860 --> 02:51:43.180]
are Spanish either Puerto Rican or Cuban so there must be a real let's real big in sayopolo

[02:51:43.180 --> 02:51:48.220]
and real right in fact more that they say that's where the men are men and so are the women that's

[02:51:48.220 --> 02:51:53.400]
funny it's true though I have seen it Wednesdays advertising day at my office in New York City and I see

[02:51:53.400 --> 02:52:00.120]
these extraordinarily beautiful women and then they turn around and get guys so I I can't tell gender

[02:52:00.120 --> 02:52:06.200]
anymore and when I was young to me a gay guy was a seminary walk this dog you know now a gay guy

[02:52:06.200 --> 02:52:11.520]
somebody who only gay guys walk their dog but that was a lot of facts in my neighborhood I see

[02:52:11.520 --> 02:52:15.620]
all these people all these married guys walking their dogs that's this hell-tale sign I guess what

[02:52:15.620 --> 02:52:22.580]
I don't walk my dog how do you like that over there this was my theory in the 1950s but now you

[02:52:22.580 --> 02:52:28.680]
know I can be a quarterback a football player all the stereotype that I've ever done on gay or

[02:52:28.680 --> 02:52:35.340]
straight has has has has has dissipated and I don't care how many hockey games you watch how many times

[02:52:35.340 --> 02:52:42.360]
you see the godfather it doesn't make you macho you have you have the kutramins of a macho god

[02:52:42.360 --> 02:52:47.700]
what what is macho macho is a guy who's a sports fan all these I hate sports and I hate sports

[02:52:47.700 --> 02:52:53.180]
fans we want this is good that you got in this because on this radio station being you know sports

[02:52:53.180 --> 02:52:57.440]
one of our ponderous they really believe and there are times you'll hear some of these guys almost

[02:52:57.440 --> 02:53:01.920]
come right out and say they believe that unless you are real I'm not talking about just a hockey

[02:53:01.920 --> 02:53:05.780]
fan like I am I used to like how the sports but they become boring but unless you live in breath

[02:53:05.780 --> 02:53:10.400]
sports and love to gamble on it too that you're a faggot that basically you're a real

[02:53:10.400 --> 02:53:15.920]
panty that you're not a real man unless sports is your entire life I feel that all the people who

[02:53:15.920 --> 02:53:21.560]
listen to this station all these fans yelling and saying we won we we want I think of T.S. Elliott

[02:53:21.560 --> 02:53:28.400]
the hollow men the empty men can't our life we didn't win it's like looking at Ron Jeremy in

[02:53:28.400 --> 02:53:34.580]
a film having sexing we got laid no you can get laid Ron Jeremy got laid it's like

[02:53:34.580 --> 02:53:40.520]
curious I wasn't a good test it's like watching me at a buffet we ain't no I ain't you more on you

[02:53:40.520 --> 02:53:45.340]
saw me eating I mean this like here you know that would that would be that just gave you the next

[02:53:45.340 --> 02:53:50.380]
best idea for screw magazine you know maybe you already did it but I don't it is to out all the gay

[02:53:50.380 --> 02:53:51.300]
athletes out
