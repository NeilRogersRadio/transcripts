[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.280]
Girlfriend could never see a commers for him and once mwah hazus check the moment through she wants the

[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:40.960]
beautiful emotions, but be fair, I can't remember her, baby I just couldn't remember me, now

[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.480]
my daughter was the one who had given me a present for me, and for the first time?

[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.920]
MOM.

[00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:08.100]
Yeah, exactly. Okay, it's 10 on 7 at 5.60 W to QM. Good morning to you know Steve Tyler. I was listening in the car yesterday. I was just blurring those speakers. They were thumping and pumping and bumping and the speakers too.

[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.540]
I was thinking to myself Steve Tyler is the Pavelle Burry of music.

[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.060]
Mortal Men only can dream of doing the things with their hoist that he can do. You know what I'm saying?

[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.980]
Speaking of Pavelle Burry by the way, sideline two to three weeks.

[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.560]
Oh, that's right. He's undergoing Arthur. Our Arthur. I got free Scopic and he's surgery right now today as well. I speak.

[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.260]
I expected to be out two to three weeks. So I don't want to say it's all over boys and girls, but tomorrow night it's going to be a real test.

[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.740]
Real test to see if we have any real men left on that team. You know I'm talking about.

[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:50.760]
By the way, speaking of real men, I see the ratings are out. It was Arbitrens for November, December and January. The latest rolling three months.

[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.560]
And guess who kicked serious asked by the way. Yeah, you guessed it.

[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.500]
Oh, God. Right. Mornings actually went up a little bit there. Huh?

[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.460]
That must have been because guilty. Miss some of those shows. He was on those trips. You know the hockey team.

[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.640]
Mornings actually went up a little bit. Not nothing to a spectacitor, but nice job there guys in the morning.

[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.420]
Don't get you know, don't go by in a new house, but they went up a little bit.

[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.480]
I think I think I must have had some of those bad press conferences last month.

[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.860]
A little bit of a problem there. But boy did we kick some serious gigantic ass.

[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.200]
And again, like Yeldie was saying the other day, it must be an accident, must be a mistake.

[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.060]
And I see the TV ratings out to Tom Jicke, finally decided to write something all over through the business section in the Sun Sentinel today.

[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.080]
Here's a mobile and sunrise. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir.

[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.920]
I want to tell you about an issue I'm going through right now.

[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.560]
I got up this morning and the license plate was going off my car. Yeah.

[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.320]
And along with an unknown saying that I was taking away because my insurance being inspired. Yeah.

[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.580]
Went to my insurance carrier. I've had insurance since the end of September. Yeah.

[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.500]
And now here I am running around today trying to get my driver's license reinstated. I got to go get a new license plate. Yeah.

[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.000]
I'm missing $200 that I want to make today going to work. Yeah. Well, don't do it again.

[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.160]
Okay. Now what was I talking about that was so important. The ratings. Oh, yeah. The ratings. I'll get to those in a second.

[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.420]
This guy I got a piece of advice to you pal. Keep your car in the garage. Don't have a garage. Go get yourself a house.

[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.500]
That's got a garage. Or put it in somebody else's garage. And then they can't come along in the compass. Get your license plate. There you go.

[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:41.540]
Come on. Solve. Thank you. Neil. 9 minutes after 10 at 560 WQ. We'll get to those ratings. I'm pouring over these. It's only a trend. But I don't care.

[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:49.360]
And oh, yes. Tom Zicker with the TV ratings. That's what I started to say. And when he, when he actually went up not too much, but they went up. And you want to know why they want to.

[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.520]
Did they go up like on any of their prime time programs? No. They went up on the heat games.

[00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:07.360]
What's the lotion in the basket? If you want to get on like a tree in your yard, it's Viagra.

[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.320]
Oh, wow.

[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:16.840]
When she asked you what's up, what you can get out of this Viagra.

[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.020]
There it goes. Where will it grow? Where will it grow? You will like your HMO.

[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:36.200]
Made for men. That was made for men. That was a woman. Your boys will go us women.

[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.600]
You'll be glad that you paid when you finally get laid. It's Viagra.

[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:54.120]
Getting girls is a cinch when you've robed by the enchants Viagra.

[00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.620]
On my pills, I won't skim because I don't want to go limp anymore.

[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:32.600]
I'm going to get a little bit of a

[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:51.220]
little bit of a

[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:38.960]
little bit of a

[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.060]
little bit of a

[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.460]
little bit of a

[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:46.460]

[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:46.460]

[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:46.460]

[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:46.700]
little bit of a

[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:46.740]
little bit of a

[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.320]
little bit of a

[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.060]
little bit of a

[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:58.480]
little bit of a

[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.880]
little bit of a

[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.180]
little bit of a

[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:19.340]
little bit of a

[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:19.340]

[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:19.340]

[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:19.340]

[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:21.820]
...

[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:30.900]
Well, the agency people are coming in today and we're going to get go with

[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.120]
those uh... TV spots that Greg promised you in your contract

[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.240]
and it was the way he said it

[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.220]
and again he's a good guy not knocking john jiris he's a really good guy but

[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.500]
it was just the way he said it because it made it so clear that in other words

[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.880]
we don't really promote anybody on a and we don't do anything we don't spend

[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.560]
a dime

[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.660]
in fact of the fact that they went out and bought a few t-shirts they had like a

[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.920]
big celebration party traded out of course the celebrate the fact that

[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.140]
somebody sprung for a few bucks for t-shirts that's a q a m on them

[00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.400]
do we have any bumper stickers no key change no anything of any meaning for

[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.080]
the audience no but we got a few t-shirts

[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.040]
and it just it just sticks in my mind the way he said that like you know

[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.080]
well you know if we know what's in your contract and we know that unless we

[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.300]
actually go through with us and do it you'll sue our ass so you know there

[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.780]
are going to come in and we'll get around to doing this and of course then

[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.380]
they did come in and then they just slab it all that pancake makeup on me

[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.160]
and they made hank look like he had the melanoma from head to toe and uh...

[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.880]
what a disaster that was and then immediately as soon as they ran that

[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.980]
uh... campaign the numbers went down

[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.320]
our ratings went down from the way they promoted so like i said it must have

[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.760]
been the great promotion from q a m that put us to

[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.800]
number this is the really is shocking

[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.580]
should i get humble and thank the audience now they don't want to hear that

[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.520]
they want to hear you ask all

[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.000]
life wl yf this is a twelve plus this is the entire audience which a m

[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.260]
stations just don't appear especially ones that speak english don't appear

[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.580]
and this category usually

[00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.300]
wl yf has a six point five share number one number two twelve plus midday

[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:05.180]
wq a m five point two now that's ten to three ten to three p.m. so that means

[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.860]
we're doing what close to a six year

[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.180]
more you think more

[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.180]
well yeah hank had like a two point six outlisten

[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.780]
you know those press conferences will kill you hank

[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.840]
i think it was just that one

[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.200]
one of about forty five minutes that one

[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.160]
yet one day

[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.380]
that'll kill it but anyway we're doing over a six year

[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.380]
on this radio station and yesterday i don't want to mention that little

[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.500]
propaganda because i want to identify them but it just astonishes me that

[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.220]
this guy takes himself seriously because nobody else does

[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.660]
and like i have to answer remember what they said to godfather you have to

[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.700]
answer for centino

[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.400]
michael told carlor you have to answer for centino carl

[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.380]
that's why he said the biggest we didn't the card didn't get too far

[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.700]
was not among those accidents but nobody got hurt well

[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.940]
oh hi hi clomenta

[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.620]
they just happened to be sitting in the back seat with leaf gear it or some

[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.460]
kind of a gear it member leaf gear it wonder what she's doing these days

[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.000]
so anyway of course men eighteen plus ten a m to three p.m. let's

[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.520]
is that thing still in here by the way

[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:08.980]
the thing that goes

[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.220]
yeah exactly

[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.140]
we're breathless about it

[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.600]
that is screw and by the way anybody has any doubt

[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.240]
you think that the monica story is the spectacular and that and in fact let's

[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.380]
bring Andrew Morton in here he wrote the dianna book

[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.000]
he wrote this monica book that's out now

[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.260]
and we tell you right to screw and book

[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.480]
yeah that's what you'll be saying

[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.300]
it makes monica look like a piker rhymes with

[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.220]
so men eighteen plus ten a m to three p.m. and eight point nine were

[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.100]
figure we got like close to a ten sheer

[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.960]
in this latest trend every demographic up

[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.160]
gigantic morning's like I said up a little bit nice going there guys

[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.340]
keep y'all the traveling around a lot keep them off that show you be surprised

[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.000]
what you could do

[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.980]
and in the afternoon like I said they're having like a

[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:55.400]
uh...

[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:00.100]
a problem there i think they do a handkerchief and really croak that was in

[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.920]
January wasn't remember that was that in February

[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:04.840]
uh...

[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.280]
i remember exactly when that was a few weeks ago and had to be with the

[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.560]
editor jane where because it was when they were doing the uh... super well

[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.560]
stuff that's right it was during that week when they were a

[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.840]
sam was trying to kill hank and running around the one hundred yard dashes

[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.320]
to try to get on the urn time at pp stadium

[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.700]
they'll kill you hank i'm telling you this place will kill you

[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.160]
so it's by the lack of promotion it's by the fact that we're on an a m.signal

[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.380]
with a very marginal signal that doesn't nobody gets indoors here we are

[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.260]
nice go and deal

[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.500]
i'm slept myself on the back

[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.800]
because i know the people in the newspapers while it's only a trend we don't

[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.240]
write about trends course the last two books that came out

[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.920]
rating books they didn't write about those either did they know

[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.160]
you little ball headed geek tom

[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.700]
but in the business section here you go

[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.180]

[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:54.640]

you know number one in pigmies number one in uh... you know blind people number one

[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.160]

[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.140]
got some kind of a story

[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.540]
well by the way there is one very interesting thing in time jika's column

[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:06.980]

[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:55.840]
boat republic

[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.320]

part of our bonuses some of us here

[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.660]
instead of having to carry the whole god in thing by my big fat pimpley

[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.100]
back home even while i'm sick as a dog and by the way

[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.160]
sometime a little later this morning uh...

[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.380]

[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.760]
i was doing really good i felt great yesterday and actually i sound better

[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.020]
today you know what i really sound for the first time in months

[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:03.920]
i sound like me not that great but i sound like me but at any rate uh... and i

[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.220]
was feeling a lot better than last night i went to the track now i don't want to

[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.820]
blame anybody else

[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.880]
for my own weaknesses for being a total failure when it comes to my weight

[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.580]
especially when i've been so sick and i know that a lot of it has to do for being

[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.000]
fat and out of shape but i will say that you know fat richer mind me my mother

[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.240]
but the track last night i have a bowl of soup beef barley soup which if there

[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.520]
was barley in there by the way shy lot combs couldn't have found it but never

[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.120]
and then i had a little bit of that cool slow you know that they have that

[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.500]
they put on every table and that that's it that's all i was going to have

[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.160]
because i had a real good food day again yesterday which i've been doing

[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.320]
progressively and then at that point the fat man fat rich says

[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.780]
you're gonna have and this is of course is after he's eaten his full meal

[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.720]
naturally which i do and burst even see what it all was

[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.780]
he says uh... you're gonna have some dessert

[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.240]
and of course being as weak as i am

[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.200]
that was the end of that

[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.320]
huh

[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.840]
your week week so he has a big piece of chocolate cake

[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.360]
that they have like a little bit of marshmallow topping on this i really kind of

[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.600]
a gourmet chocolate cake and the waitress says to me oh would you like a scoop

[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.420]
of ice cream with that i said yeah chocolate

[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.120]
so he just has you see how this works he just has the cake

[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.940]
i have the cake with a big scoop of chocolate ice cream which is very good by

[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.840]
the way and then today i'm not feeling as good as i was yesterday and the

[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:25.960]
scale is back up a pound and my blood sugar was like soaring soaring skyrocketing

[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.160]
so i don't want to blame fat rich but uh... you know cut the crap

[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.540]
fatso stop it

[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.140]
but you'd like i've said before fat people when they hang around with other fat

[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:41.300]
people like algal's they need love to make sure that you stay fat they can't

[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.040]
stand if you have any success because then it puts them under tremendous

[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.680]
enormous pressure

we have an open line in uh...

[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.580]
broard five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty see you cubans better

[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.940]
get with the program okay because we're we're taking up prisoners on the show

[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.240]
we're running away and just hiding from everybody that's how gigantic we're

[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:51.540]
doing at least this month anyway i know time you don't write about trends you

[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.420]
don't write about radio nobody cares everybody cares about television it's

[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:56.080]
big bucks

[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.500]
when he's got a story all of com at least as a better job than what's his name

[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.060]
over there to the hero they both by the way right these stories in the

[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.780]
business sections of today's papers about the tv ratings

[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:10.200]
since it's got a little to entertain enough and like like us making money that's

[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.020]
what it's all about that's why we got that marlin's game today because we're

[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.860]
making so much money on it although you will hear some of our spots in middle

[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.560]
of the ballgame by them but anyway so whammy channel 69 where we had that

[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.060]
that the now defunct show that disaster and remember the comments there at the

[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.840]
very end with one of the hot shots of us maddie leshin with some of their ass

[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.500]
oh yeah we're really disappointed that neo-rangers show and we can't wait to

[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:37.620]
find a replacement well guess what the only non-kids program on whammy and the

[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.480]
latest meals in this the average are rating as high as a one point

[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:46.580]
out rating is the 630 rerun of mash for the seven heat telecast whammy

[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:50.980]
averaged 4.6 rating the heat post game show averaged 2.5 so all their

[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:56.580]
increases had to do with the heat that doesn't take any talent to put on you know

[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.640]
a professional sporting that's already got a tremendous following and have

[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.360]
numbers from it that that takes no talent whatsoever other than just you know

[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:08.180]
has to be having a big checkbook and writing a check or like in the case of

[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.860]
this place somebody with a small checkbook promising to write a big check oh I

[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.620]
see there he goes again that was bad but Greg Reads got a big

[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.560]
ego what did I say when we were on i.o.d about the deal he made for all

[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:23.580]
these sports franchises what did I say I said it then I'll say it again now

[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.920]
active suicide an active lunacy but it makes him feel like a sports big shot that's

[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.160]
why we're all here that's why Neil had to come over here to have all these big

[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.180]
numbers and bring all this revenue even though Neil doesn't do a sports show

[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:39.320]
and he's a screaming old juke queen fact because we had to have some way to

[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.020]
sustain the ship while we were trying to like put all these other pieces of

[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.640]
the sports puzzle together to make Greg feel like a real real super

[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.680]
much work much old man yeah

[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:54.960]
so there is very much aware of all the children that were there all the voices stayed there

[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.240]
and she is the one who always said that Michael excuse my expression but he's a

[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:07.960]
bag and she would say that damn's bag and I can't stand him

[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.720]
never touch a behind

[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:37.680]
this beautiful and it's fine

[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:47.620]
it's so crazy when it passes when it's bigger it's better

[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:52.240]
yeah still my hands it touched my chest

[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:52.800]
what's worse?

[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.520]
oh

[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:55.900]
my best

[00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:56.640]
came

[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.280]
into my life

[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:00.840]
oh

[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.060]
how it makes me feel fine

[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.640]
she's 16

[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.260]
so beautiful

[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.220]
and it's mine

[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.920]
146 and 560

[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.900]
we got the Vancouver

[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:18.560]
virtual at your well and to the flot we got the booster at six and camp on the 10 tomorrow

[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.080]
we got the panthers hosting Carolina

[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.620]
do we're died of our night baby

[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.500]
without pop Elborid

[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.400]
Jesus he just comes back for a couple of periods and it's like uh you know

[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.700]
see ya see in a few weeks

[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.560]
but tomorrow with or without and it's going to be without his do we're dying these guys better

[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.240]
butchered up so here's the fact that says um i'm 26 and i would have to say that these actors

[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:44.420]
are the best of these times although i agree with George the chuan pen as much as we can

[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.880]
stand him personally he is an outstanding actor

[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.980]
Denzel Washington do i agree with that?

[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.980]
no he's okay Gary Olman

[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.080]
man okay John Melkovich

[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.220]
yeah so so no actresses Julia Roberts

[00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.380]
no no no no no no i like Julia Roberts George hates her like poison

[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.820]
didn't you like that movie uh sleeping with the enemy or she's uh just mediocre

[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.380]
didn't you like sleeping with the enemy?

[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.620]
yeah it was all right but he's no cloud at colbert

[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.740]
no she's no angry verdman

[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.940]
she's no tippy he's no Catherine Hepburn or tippy headrun

[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.580]
so you're saying she's for the birds she let makes it more like tippy headrun once she's weak

[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.320]
Julia Roberts no she's not weak i think she's pretty good it's pretty but uh nothing

[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.940]
this is the same guy by the way who said after i played amazing by uh

[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.860]
erosmith at the beginning of the show this morning said eh

[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:36.160]
but that's for you to say that and pretend that you really believe that i

[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.540]
i would lose my faith in the human race if i thought you really meant that

[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:43.760]
i just know what a prick you are mega Ryan and mega Ryan's pretty good

[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:48.740]
and Angela Bassett no it says i know you'll probably just probably agree with some of them

[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.860]
oh i saw by the way when i was in omestered on there one channel on the cable in the hotel where they

[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:57.960]
have these uh recent movies you know like uh cinemax kind of a thing but it's it's a freebie

[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:03.580]
and they show them over and over again it was a it was a uh the dumbest first you start watching it

[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.900]
and it's a black actor in there which i can't think of who he is young guy looks almost human

[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:13.520]
and it was a cop movie where his partner was his best friend and then it turned out his partner

[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:18.020]
was dealing drugs and this guy went in the sting operation and they put and they were they didn't

[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:23.300]
know whether it was supposed to be serious or a comedy it was the worst goddamn piece of crap i've

[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:28.640]
ever seen in my life they lead you along like for about the first half an hour like it's

[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.460]
going to be a serious movie and i thought well this is not too bad then and then they start making

[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:36.640]
it slapstick and then they're up into playing and the pilot dies and they're going to crash

[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:43.680]
oh god that's a movie no that that's why jesus cool got that thing in his brain by the way from

[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:51.440]
that movie i think here's Miami hello Neil yes sir how you doing Neil great uh first one

[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:56.180]
now i just had to say you have actual and taste of music yes i do absolutely i do like

[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.960]
George saying that amazing by erosmith is not one of the great records in history well

[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:05.500]
well i i i listen to that and i get chills i get goosebumps just hearing it well i'm pretty good

[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:10.880]
well i put this one to you press the heart of stone press the last button for that form to win

[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:15.000]
there you go in any case now you know we talked about

[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:21.560]
we talked about good music and obviously George has a categorized in different ways well if you

[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:29.180]
want to categorize an artist or a suitable artist who supposedly changed you know society forever

[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:33.520]
and was a great songwriter Bob Dylan is he a good singer no i'm not sure that's a new movie

[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:39.360]
yeah i think no i can't he always George always tries to confuse the argument by changing the topic

[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:44.340]
of discussion and trying to tell him we're not discussing great musicians in other words in terms

[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:49.440]
of composers and lyricists and anything else we're talking about people who make music in other

[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.860]
words who are recording artists not people who are writers i mean Bob Dylan is the best example of

[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:58.560]
all couldn't sing his way out of a paper bag at the end full they hear him sing one note right

[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:03.080]
and you know what Neil i'm a big dore fan but i pretty much know that you're more so what is the

[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:08.700]
singer okay now how can you say that Jim Morrison wasn't a great singer i mean i'm telling you

[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:16.640]
Jim Morrison wasn't great singer did i hear you just say that sir oh my god i can't believe that

[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:21.160]
well now i know why people in america eat so much vanilla ice cream i'm a huge eight

[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:26.460]
but i'm telling you i'm a huge dore fan and i love it and there were for years there used to be

[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.420]
a big argument about who had the greatest voice in recording history and people some people say

[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:34.860]
bergen coming to the guess who a lot of people would say uh... jim morrison had perfect the perfect

[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:39.840]
voice perfect pitch like uh... you know water johnson had perfect pitch well let me tell you

[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:44.080]
the strange days was the best album i thought that they've ever come up with actually not at all

[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:49.560]
of all time but how did you say that jim morrison i have a great i don't know i guess it's difficult

[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:56.300]
to get difficult it's difficult to judge uh you know very good very good boy so i never saw him live

[00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.140]
so you know that's pretty much the way you judge a uh... yeah i think i'm well they had a quick

[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:03.740]
hand that's what they said they came to my amie uh... the other thing you know you know that i

[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:08.040]
was the when and doubt with an out concert tour oh yeah and uh... yeah great that you know and then

[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:13.680]
yeah yeah yeah they uh... put him in from coming to my amie uh well i think in my amie yeah

[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:19.240]
absolutely well in any case uh the other thing uh the uh as far as ratings go uh first of all wouldn't

[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:23.960]
ratings are great ladies and gentlemen thank you so much you're helping the continue putting us

[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.680]
into places nobody could possibly believe on a make believe station like this one but of course

[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:33.440]
you can't be too successful therefore we're having marlin's pregame right uh... and that's that's

[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:38.560]
gonna be a real ratings booster twelve of marlin's exhibition i'm just curious what did the man don't

[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:43.100]
get for saturday i mean it doesn't break it down okay doesn't break it down okay well the final

[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:47.700]
thing you yes uh if you can play out of smith loving an elevator just a hundred and a half George okay

[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:55.160]
see yeah i would have thought of it what this ass sucker who is just on there why would that bother me

[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:00.260]
because you don't like your husband i do like a Rosemite and i don't yeah i mean we got a short show

[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:04.860]
so i sure someone have time to do like an arrow smith medley today but there you go that's a

[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:11.560]
little bit of it not all their recent stuff is uh up to snow that's all how about the beach boys

[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:18.000]
reason stuff that's not as good because there isn't any that happens to a lot of bands

[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.300]
so i thought this is good and again you're bringing in something that's not the discussion

[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.160]
that's like saying that Beethoven his recent stuff isn't up to stuff so he isn't any good you know

[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.560]
if you're in a classical music would anybody with a brain say that they think it's got

[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.380]
towards of the other brain would never come to work here they're great i love that

[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:43.520]
by the way of oh Beethoven yeah that's it and Brahms we have an open line in brown at five six seven

[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.300]
oh five sixty and pound five sixty in a mobile one on see what you do when you know you've got like a

[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:51.260]
some kind of a sinus infection or some kind of like an infection in your head and your neck

[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:55.800]
and you can't find a doctor who can diagnose even a hang nail and it just keeps lingering and it's

[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.540]
annoying and it you don't feel it's like anything serious and you're not dying but it just uh

[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:05.240]
it interferes with your ability to live and work and uh feel good what do you do about that you know

[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:09.060]
do you go out there and you start like beating up doctors you're bringing Luca Brotsey to make an

[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:12.700]
offer they can't refuse what do you do about it well maybe in about another half hour have you

[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:19.040]
make that call it will find out what kind of a grotesque uh thing i got maybe it's like leprosy i

[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.580]
only wish because leprosy i understand it's highly contagious i think i'll stop up and see Greg

[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:29.100]
after the show here's a mobile in choral jayville so hello hello nil can hear me yes sir i hear

[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:34.180]
you are you do i got an idea for the cancer's nail we're gonna ship them off the odds to the emeral

[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:39.980]
city maybe there they can find a heart corrosion some brains and for real real lucky we can find a

[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:47.660]
pair of balls for Robbie anybody have a heart or a liver no yeah okay maybe we can take your

[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:52.400]
Robbie and Walter Peyton at the same time okay anybody have a heart or a liver heart for Robbie

[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:56.640]
and a liver for Walter we have an open line and brownered five six seven oh five sixty pound five

[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.980]
sixty animal but one line so when am i getting back to these ratings just briefly overall oh this

[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:05.220]
is some men well that's that's a good category nobody cares about women listeners i hate to

[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:11.120]
break the news to you ladies but nobody cares that's a bad thing to say but it's true q a m second

[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:18.280]
and then five point five nice going guys hot 105 four nine two four eight radio and mom bc here we

[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:21.900]
go again just like that univision channel 23 i remember the show i did a few months ago about

[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.480]
that we had a lot of people lie oh well they're all watching that soap opera well guess what that

[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:29.540]
soap opera's not on anymore isn't it that soap opera that was on at eight o'clock at night on

[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:35.720]
channel 23 as moreldo whatever was that it i guess something like that what do you mean you don't

[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:41.940]
know you knew back then it was pretty weak but but at any rate it's over now it's over there some other

[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:46.840]
crap on there in addition to which from seven a m to one and a m as moreldo ain't on and they're

[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:52.060]
still number one overall because we got all these and those beginning glazed people in here we

[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:56.280]
just don't want to give it a program that's why a radio mom b a wacky you've got to be wacky to

[00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:02.360]
listen to it fidel fidel on the same old tired swill by the way i mean a really bad bad spanish

[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:06.140]
language a m station that's why that the only other a m station that even shows up on a rickter

[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:11.580]
scale here oh by the way you know we didn't check now let's see does it this would include

[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:17.800]

[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:28.040]
taking his one successful show out of the afternoon and putting the babbling brook in there in the

[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:33.500]
afternoon so i'll get to that after we do the break and that that could be pretty revealing Pete

hang on tight bulger oh my god won't that be something if the afternoons take a precipitate dive

[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:44.860]
over there in addition to which how come a hank went down a little bit you think that she did it

[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:50.660]
because i know damn well if i have to choose between hank even on his worst days and listening to

[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:58.040]
her is there any choice no is there any content i mean let's get serious so like we always like to say

[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.400]
when we get you know those number it was a fluke we always like to say that even though we don't

[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.780]
believe it and it probably was probably some anti-semites got some diaries why are you airing

[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:08.780]
shit like this

[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:47.480]
i can't take too much butter i can't take it at all i asked for it from old and drunk and especially

[00:38:47.480 --> 00:39:02.120]
sorbets all i can't stop it in the cold water i want to know the world i can't

[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:12.960]
take too much butter it goes through me too fast every time i eat it i have to change my hand

[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:18.840]
i can't take too much but when you said that jim morse you had a voice like butter so they said

[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:22.180]
that it's a bitch in the bottle okay just can't take it too much butter baby it makes it

[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:29.720]
slang suspects a gay man made pass in silicaga alabama a friend of theirs by the way but it

[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.800]
happened to be one of those you know only made a pass at him so they said which means he must

[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.300]
add bad eyesight not a series two man they look this like they came out of that tree an entry

[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:42.900]
steven eric mullins 25 charles munroe butler 21 were arrested this week and charged with murder

[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:49.120]
in the slang of billi jack aether 39 they plotted his murder for two weeks beat him to death with an

[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:56.960]
ax handle and burned the body on a pyre hole tires and the only reason that they caught him butler

[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.720]
confessed monday after seeing he couldn't sleep and mullins admitted his involvement two days

[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:06.420]
later while in jail on unrelated charges mullins said god told him he needed to confess

[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:15.300]
stop and think about that again god told him confessed he didn't tell him ahead of time probably

[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:19.840]
not a good idea to do this okay so don't do it but afterward he said hey i want you to have a

[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.620]
real guilty conscience you better go and confess because confession is good for the soul

[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:30.700]
and he said okay great okay we have two open lines and brown one and

[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:04.280]
cubans that don't listen to the station by the way in fact actually they didn't listen to that station

[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:08.700]
but somebody on one of the uh spanish language ojón provocateur stations got them all stirred up

[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:13.220]
and so right away they had them calling us you know this that this has happened so many times in

[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.440]
the years i've been under here in this town people who don't even listen to the station don't

[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:20.840]
even know what my name is start calling all worked up into a frenzy because somebody told them

[00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:24.330]
usually it's out of context and wrong anyway but told them i said something that they could all

[00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:28.910]
been out of shape about whatever happened in our shed in the business maribel hey there's me like

much shorter than i thought today five six seven oh five sixty anybody got the amonica book yet

[00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:22.790]

[00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.970]
TV shows around well of course that's all they're talking about because they've been talking

[00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:40.230]
about it for 13 months and they're going to continue milking it until there's one drop of milk left

[00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:45.790]

[00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:34.430]
oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the 18t wireless line see we went through the last

[00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:38.230]
couple of months these phones have been dead in a door nail on this show am i right and it don't

[00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:43.530]
make any difference you know just because people get phone calls in fact this station is living

[00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:48.990]
proof of that just because there are people who call in to want to know about that god damn temple

[00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:52.570]
your shiver game doesn't necessarily mean there are a whole lot of people listening to it

[00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:57.130]
just because you're giving a bunch of crap away and people say oh yeah you know look at all the

[00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:00.490]
calls on it boy that doesn't mean there's a whole lot of people listening especially if it's

[00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:04.550]
really terminal boring radio like giveaways on here and you notice by the way since we stop

[00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:07.890]
giving crap away on here i were making this jar again it come back the last two trends

[00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:13.770]
yeah that's right so all you snores okay go to the flea market and fill out an entry blank maybe

[00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:19.250]
to win something maybe to win some please get out of our push and stop killing our goddamn show

[00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:27.070]
depots Tony sports showdown are you up to the challenge Saturday morning today only on

[00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:33.130]
sports radio five six this is one of the amazing moments in the history of my life first i was

[00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:37.030]
going into this fact that i got to show you how bad taste some people have it's all subjective

[00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:41.630]
but like i said a lot of people like vanilla ice cream some clown out there the top 10 greatest

[00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:45.710]
recording artists of all time what for the year this was but even more shocking i'm even not

[00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:49.730]
playing the bit i'm going right to it i'm not paying any attention to directions we got patch

[00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:56.430]
atoms on the line i i heard the buzz i didn't quite hear you what yeah hello good morning we got

[00:46:56.430 --> 00:47:01.670]
doctor uh feel good on the line yeah well we are three months later i'm still sick i still got

[00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:06.570]
the heat in the push i got my biopsy on my neck which i still can't get the answers i did that's

[00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:13.070]
why i'm calling you i'm sick right see i i was kind of upset on your behalf and for myself too

[00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:17.050]
because like you were really really upset and i was like how can i convince you that it was going

[00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:21.390]
to turn out to be something that just a little time had to pass but it hasn't passed i wait

[00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:26.290]
wait he did the biopsy he called me a moment ago and he told me at the very most what i mean he

[00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:30.830]
called you well because i i was the one that that i i let him know that i was interested in following

[00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:34.950]
up on you and i don't know who it was i told you i know i know i'm i don't in person like i

[00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:38.970]
got down here in eighty three yeah he's a good guy right there very good guy panther fan and he

[00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:45.690]
also cares to see no does he know anything about about about the thing no he said he sent it to a

[00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:50.650]
world renowned friend of his yes the university of Miami right and it's a very non-specific thing

[00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:56.130]
it's a my if if it's anything it's a minor contact dermatitis it was something that touched you

[00:47:56.130 --> 00:48:00.010]
problem and he asked me if i did the line i said yes it wasn't the line uh

[00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:04.410]
but i didn't have the right to the time that you did that thing correct that's right now that's

[00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:08.850]
that's always another possibility we could redo it but i i haven't think it's i i would let you

[00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:14.090]
hope that i think it's longer you'd let it go for a while longer see Neil everything we have to

[00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:19.310]
decide there's nuciences which i'm very sympathetic with it being uncomfortable and then there's

[00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:24.270]
problems and the problems are the things that can you know blossom into something else and i had

[00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:28.790]
i want to wait that's why you haven't heard from me in weeks i've been listening to you you

[00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:34.130]
sound you know you always keep me when i tell you how you feel i feel like cramp but it's got i

[00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:38.610]
bet it's got nothing to do with that i mean even even when you told you know what this is this is

[00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:43.350]
proof of what i said before it's like you go into your doctor and you say hey doc how do i feel

[00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:48.190]
yeah and then this is proof of it well you try to how i love how you feel but see i feel like cramp

[00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:53.370]
in this profession if you're humanistic about it which you know i try to be the fact is that you

[00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:58.490]
have to deal with a lot of uncertainty there oftentimes there are no definitive answers these

[00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:04.770]
these cell reactions sliding under the under the radar let's back up a second so Stanley a doctor

[00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:10.810]
Stanley told you what it's a very non-specific a minor non-specific reaction most likely a contact

[00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:15.990]
dermatitis sometimes have to once well see there's a million things that can do that you usually

[00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:20.830]
look for a pattern and a and a duration and a and a and a rhythm of the thing like for instance

[00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:25.270]
when i had a rash on my wrists and i've seen a lot of guys with the same thing i discovered that my

[00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:29.250]
wanderer had changed the brand of sparks that they used and that was all it took to give me a rash

[00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:34.510]
on my wrist okay yeah but doctor Stanley says you wouldn't have a rash only in one spot but you can

[00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:38.810]
it's not there's no test see now we got two doctors that can put the information right off the

[00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:44.310]
belly but it's not what i'm saying is you can i'm not about the pain in my right wrist the joint

[00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:49.190]
pain and the sharp pain in the bone that comes and goes every now and then see now all these all

[00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:53.390]
these things wait i have it you know i have i have not been able to listen as much as i was

[00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:57.790]
paying the back well these are not new things these are things that i came to you with like three

[00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:03.490]
once ago it's the same thing they're all very non-specific right they don't have to again we

[00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:08.310]
i had a lady in here with real-life lines yesterday real-life lines and she had been razzed by her

[00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:13.590]
doctors for a year and a half because it was just so vague it was so nebulous nobody could pin it

[00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:18.490]
down until she demanded they do a line test yeah and it came back positive right now i'm not telling you

[00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:21.650]
you got nobody and what do you do for us somebody would line this out what we treated with the

[00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:25.590]
antibiotics for a month right and i i gave her i told her it's going to be a while we're going to

[00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:29.810]
have to take some time like even a year to find out what the resolution of symptoms is going to be

[00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:34.090]
and and to go on with her life because there's nothing more she can do about it right now

[00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:38.310]
that do her do her very best to keep herself in good shape see i see i know i'm a hardass but no

[00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:43.190]
matter what you say or doctor Stanley or anybody else says i believe firmly yeah then i have some

[00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:48.470]
kind of infection like in your ear it's in the ears it's in my head it's in my neck and it in

[00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:52.530]
my head i don't mean in my head like in my brain but i have like some kind of an infection in my head

[00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:56.350]
or in my neck you may recall that the very first time we met when you were working at the station

[00:50:56.350 --> 00:51:00.750]
on a causeway right you had been complaining about the the air ducts and so forth and that's what

[00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:05.110]
i listed it you and said i could try to help you you know maybe it's the same thing maybe that

[00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:09.330]
never did clear completely but remember Neil and maybe this is from that plane that i told you

[00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:13.250]
about we're coming back with that sick the war air blowing in my phone well absolutely all

[00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:18.630]
the above possibilities the thing is and the part that makes look you know i i care about the people

[00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:23.030]
who i take care of there's people i don't care about because they're not going to let me right but

[00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:28.250]
the uncertainty part it's like it's like raising a child you don't know if you're doing it right

[00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:32.430]
until you see down the road what happens and you have to keep your fingers crossed that you're doing

[00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:36.430]
everything with the best intentions we deal with a lot if i just hang on another seven or eight months

[00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:40.330]
in my go away well i hope it doesn't last two seven or eight months because i'd like to get it

[00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:44.430]
off your mind well it's already three we're talking three months now doc the beginning of

[00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:49.070]
January is our recall no middle of December when it started i came in the late in December i came

[00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:55.150]
in the CU see well my my instinct as you know is when i get a choice and by the way doctor a

[00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:58.510]
pops good yucking case he's listening over Cleveland clinic it wasn't the add-alat

[00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:03.810]
well that's you know that's why that's why i stayed away from you for a while because i needed to

[00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:06.850]
let some time pass and see what would happen it wasn't the add-alat although i'll tell you my

[00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:10.110]
blood pressure is a lot better taking the other stuff and it's a lot cheaper too but be that as in

[00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:15.310]
may okay all right how you doing on your diet anyway i'm doing real good i'm doing

[00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:18.770]
even a firey by looking at you well up until last night i was doing pretty good till i had to take

[00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:23.770]
an ice cream and pop it apart thanks to fat rich but anyway let's get back to my nick and the red

[00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:29.050]
come on let's stop dr. patch let's get to it so what did he tell you what do we do now what's the

[00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:34.650]
next move he suggested take to and call everybody in the morning he suggested there's a very good

[00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:39.690]
allergies he said in hollywood yeah that's that's the keep doing something suggestion there's to

[00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:44.070]
there's always many ways to do things to do something suggestion is to go to the allergist and

[00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:49.770]
get some patch testing no pun intended to add them to no pun intended the second thing to do is

[00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:53.570]
just wait a while longer and that the very most put some what you know he's got i'm sure he's

[00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:58.090]
given you some kind of steward courtes on cream or something yes this is my third they're kind of

[00:52:58.090 --> 00:53:03.190]
shmurren on take six weeks you know in the old days of dermatology they used to say if it's dry

[00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:08.030]
wet it if it's wet dry it if you don't know what it is use cortisone but that was before they learned

[00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:12.870]
how to kill people with some of the new drugs yeah so i mean just on your behalf as your friend

[00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:16.990]
for this many years now my instinct is up that shit goes away by itself and you won't even notice

[00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:21.630]
one day it's just gone oh i'll notice because that why are you checking your day up that you do

[00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:26.390]
every day and i don't have the check because when you get up in your neck is sore like mine is now

[00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:30.890]
and the back of your neck is the sore and you got the heat coming back in your face a little bit

[00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:35.470]
and all of these things you don't have to check well i'll tell you what test you know you

[00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:39.290]
when your ears are still plugged up and you feel definitely that you have like some kind of an

[00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:44.490]
inner ear infection and nobody can find it you feel like hopeless helpless i got this like him

[00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:49.730]
was then helpless i don't have it here yet there's a company in it's in brow or don't i remember where

[00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:55.930]
i call leap and it's it's a series of tests that looks for food and arrow allergens it's not as

[00:53:55.930 --> 00:54:00.490]
complicated as real-life allergy testing it's a single blood draw it's done at their own laboratory

[00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:05.110]
it's FDA approved and so forth and it just occurred to me the symptoms that they use this test for

[00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:08.710]
are they really vague and non-specific ones like the ones you're complaining about you know people

[00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:12.130]
who have got your stuff at your reach i mean i'm not going to go to the list on the air but

[00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:17.950]
you don't all the odd stuff maybe maybe when i get that test available you know you can have

[00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:22.430]
done a lot maybe we could try it i have i have a strong feeling you're going to help a lot of

[00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:26.450]
people yeah your constitutions like that you two mean to die like dusty springfield i don't

[00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:30.250]
remember and blackman would blackman yeah i'm just like well here we are he's not doing

[00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:35.330]
things all right well i basically just call it tell you i love you and i i don't want to do now mark

[00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:39.310]
what do i do now well now that you got the report this i'm so deep pressed out Maria but i think

[00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:43.970]
a bullet today would stop the pain no after hearing that i was waiting for the results of this

[00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:48.170]
biopsy which i got a nice scar on my neck by the way it's healing for me nicely be pleased to

[00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:52.010]
know that in spite of the fact that my blood sugar is soaring all over the place because i'm not

[00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:57.410]
taking at the hct and instead of and so on well it that you know i you didn't actually i didn't hear

[00:54:57.410 --> 00:55:01.730]
you specify what it was but when you try to verify it's a it's a twenty five year old drug

[00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:08.150]
excellent mild diuretic right it also causes sugar electrolyte uric acid and lipid imbalance

[00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:12.270]
you know that that may be a trait if you're convinced it wasn't the out of that you can always go

[00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:15.730]
back to something else remember i told you a long time ago your regimen was very non-standard

[00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:20.710]
but you're a non-standard kind of guy yeah um he suggested anologist my friendly personal

[00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:25.330]
i my friendly i love you i want to all meet and have it and smile together suggestion is just

[00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:28.670]
wait a while longer i'll bet you another six weeks or so and i'll bet you some more but i'm

[00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:35.310]
serious i'm serious i'm not gonna say it's way if this were if it's important to you because you're

[00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:39.490]
somewhat you're very concerned about it and you're somewhat obsessed about it okay i'm obsessed

[00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:43.470]
about that's not a criticism it's understandable when you got something this long and then it gets

[00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:47.010]
to the point where like when i was in Amsterdam on vacation the Wednesday the middle of that week

[00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:52.250]
it was basically the rash was virtually gone i felt great and the life was going on i heard

[00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:56.250]
and i've been a dare to later all of a sudden i look at a mirror and i guess what it's making a

[00:55:56.250 --> 00:56:00.630]
comeback and i'm feeling like a little bit of the symptomology again and here i am you know i don't

[00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:05.410]
need this the allergy testing will be good to give you maybe you'll find something you're allergic to

[00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:09.410]
and see especially since i'm like six thousand miles away at that point out of my home environment

[00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:14.550]
i'm not sleeping on the same sheets i'm out with the dogs exactly don't have to worry about the

[00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:18.750]
pile or whatever's in the air i'm in a totally different environment and he is still coming back

[00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:23.510]
well he can't that this thing is what like for instance when you stop the adelaide some time ago

[00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:27.550]
and one guy called the multi-doe one month ago right but it's one guy called you and told you

[00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:30.470]
you had to be out of your blood in two days the other guy called instead of be out of your blood

[00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:34.470]
in 30 days yeah either one of those answers is complete correct well what what is the answer by the

[00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:39.310]
health and the other one the phone what is the in terms of the drug level the quantity of measurable

[00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:43.890]
substance in your body the two day answer was correct but in terms of its effect on the cells

[00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:47.290]
your body it's going to take it was going to take four to six weeks to make a difference

[00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:52.250]
four to six weeks right and rashers so it still might not be over correct that's the possibility

[00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:57.190]
that's why i'm just saying if this was something urgent or growing or it looked like a lymphoma

[00:56:57.190 --> 00:57:01.670]
or it was a manifestation of some you know systemic illness like and i thought you were sick

[00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:08.890]
we could chase after it but for the love of Neil for the love of Neil God i'm trying to tell you

[00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:14.110]
to be the best call in the history of radio and you thought i was sick you know i don't think you're sick

[00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:18.470]
okay you've got you know a couple of chronic problems being in the nation as well as

[00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:23.450]
as well as anybody in better than most and my whole my teeth they all back to that aching

[00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:26.870]
and you know like that they're not a dental thing like you don't want to try to do something

[00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:31.190]
you're inhaling or something you're exposed to but you know finding that stuff is what we do with

[00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:36.450]
everyday it's so uncertain the patient discovers the pattern by the way it's back to back to line

[00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:40.670]
for instance it's sort of doing a public service on this that's a very complicated test to do it's

[00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:45.510]
not just usually not just one answer less completely negative like yours was sometimes it bears

[00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:49.210]
repeating so keep that in mind if you want to do that i guess it's been over a month so you know

[00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:52.710]
whether you do it with him or with me or with somebody else you might consider doing that but once

[00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:56.310]
you've done it a second time and it comes back negative you can really forget about it yeah that

[00:57:56.310 --> 00:58:00.770]
would be a second insect bite started this i told that told you guys that way in the

[00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:05.130]
way no i mean you come in you tell the guys what you think right and then that's it you know

[00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:10.450]
nothing i have to turn it essentially William ozler at at john topkins an internist who hopefully does

[00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:15.350]
what i hopefully i do what he did that if you listen to the patient long enough they'll give you

[00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:19.190]
the diagnosis yeah but listen it's not just a matter of listening to you sitting at one session

[00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:24.430]
it's a matter of listening over and over and over yeah in your case in front of 400,000 people

[00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:29.050]
right so he you know he like i said he suggested theologist but i would just

[00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:34.310]
friendly suggestions they just just wait just wait i remember i do this with all good intention i

[00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:38.550]
mean i'm i've actually blanked out my mind that we're talking in front of people and and it's just

[00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:43.130]
me and you saying take it easy it's going to i better fix it itself and you'll never know what it was

[00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:47.590]
you'll just look back at it and go i don't know what it was i just hope it never happens again okay okay

[00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:54.710]
okay i love you thanks okay there's patch Adam's my doctor always you got a cute nose

[00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:57.490]
why do you wear a suit

[00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:10.390]
what's the matter with lesbian officers can't you tell we really love him new balls

[00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:17.110]
the only thing that separates us from the men is the country clubs bathroom stalls

[00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:47.090]
dang my super friends ladh Harry Chica- found on the verse she might lose that is Brooke die bass Bob

[01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:14.190]
I'm very proud of the fact that Hank yesterday at the beginning of his show, if you heard

[01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:44.030]
the show, I'm very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very

[01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:13.370]
very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he was very proud of the fact that he

[01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:43.350]
had the begginal answers, no! knowing more than I did before- no! knowing more than I did before- no! there would be no more than that I'd do more than I'd do more than I'd do more than I'd do more than I'd do more than I'd do more than I'd do more than I'd do more than I'd do more than I'd do more than I'd do more than I'd do more than I'd do more than I'd do more about the fact that I was very proud of the fact that I was very proud of the fact that I was very proud of the fact that I was very proud of the fact that I was very proud of the fact that I was very proud of the fact that I was very happy about the fact that teaching to a body equals to born and grown 18 years ago

[01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:45.190]
It's not the most fun thing in the world, you know, in your neck.

[01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:51.310]
I can add a little bit of pain, but, and then they, you know, like take a plug, they take

[01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:55.290]
a chunk out of your goddamn neck, which is healing nicely by the way, Stanley.

[01:01:56.610 --> 01:01:58.690]
And I thought, you know, I'm waiting and waiting.

[01:01:58.870 --> 01:02:00.810]
He's got this top expert in the world.

[01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:04.990]
He's analyzing and looking and they got microscopes and all these multi-million dollar machines.

[01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:06.470]
And do we learn anything?

[01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.650]
No.

[01:02:07.050 --> 01:02:07.370]
Anything at all.

[01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:07.590]
No.

[01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:11.250]
So anyway, here's this fact.

[01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:14.670]
This is, this is so embarrassing that I just can't even begin to tell you.

[01:02:14.850 --> 01:02:16.510]
I mean, everything is a matter of taste.

[01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:19.530]
We go back to that vanilla ice cream versus fish food thing again.

[01:02:20.810 --> 01:02:22.670]
Vanilla ice cream versus rocky road.

[01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:27.450]
Listed are this guy's top greatest recording artist of all time.

[01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:29.910]
Sorry to say, Aerosmith is nowhere close.

[01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:32.410]
Go to the bank on these, bar none.

[01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:37.470]
He said, when I get to number eight, I swear to you, you better have a towel handy.

[01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:41.910]
Because you'll pee in your pants wherever you are, you'll be peeing all over the place.

[01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:43.330]
Number one to Beatles.

[01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:44.610]
Well, a lot of people would agree with that.

[01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:45.070]
I don't.

[01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:46.990]
Number one to Beatles, he says.

[01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:48.430]
Number two, fat stomino.

[01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:50.350]
I love fat stomino, but I wouldn't agree with that.

[01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:51.370]
Number three, Elvis.

[01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:52.930]
I definitely wouldn't agree with that.

[01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:55.090]
Elvis, in my list, wouldn't even be in the top half.

[01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:56.010]
Does not even close.

[01:02:56.910 --> 01:03:02.790]
To say that Elvis is better than Aerosmith is like saying that that dog is better than

[01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:03.910]
the shadow, but he on.

[01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:06.850]
That's how we do number four, the supreme.

[01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:12.310]
Okay, now I love Motown, but of all the Motown recording artists, the supreme are way

[01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:13.830]
down on my list.

[01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:16.390]
Number five, speaking of that is Marvin Gaye.

[01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:20.290]
So just those back to back, the idea that he says the supreme is better than Marvin Gaye

[01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:22.570]
shows you this man's taste is in his rectum.

[01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:24.070]
Number six, Rolling Stones.

[01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:25.550]
They're okay.

[01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:26.770]
Number seven, Chicago.

[01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:27.650]
I love Chicago.

[01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:28.950]
I would go along with that.

[01:03:29.110 --> 01:03:29.910]
They're definitely on the list.

[01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:31.630]
Here's number eight.

[01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:33.250]
Okay, everybody listing right out.

[01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:37.450]
Don't want to cause any accidents, either in your pants or on the highway or whatever

[01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:40.470]
you're doing right now if you're working with a dangerous machinery equipment.

[01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:49.490]
Number eight, on this man's top ten recording list of all time, Frankie Lyman and the teenagers.

[01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:59.930]
Frankie Lyman and the S&T agents.

[01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:21.070]
I like that record.

[01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:22.470]
I had the record in 1956.

[01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:24.770]
I went out there and bought it when I was 14 years old.

[01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:28.410]
But they're one of the top, they're number eight of all time.

[01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:30.530]
And a lot of people stop listening to music.

[01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:33.230]
Number nine, four seasons.

[01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:37.010]
Like the four seasons, I love the four seasons, but to say that they're one of the top ten

[01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:40.970]
recording groups of all time, to me is really pushing it, you know, with all the respect

[01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:42.150]
to Frankie and the Valley.

[01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:45.870]
I used to like them a lot better before they recorded that stupid jewelry rental song,

[01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:48.530]
which was like 40 years ago.

[01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.890]
Is that anything here by the way?

[01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:51.830]
Oh, huh?

[01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:53.110]
Nah, it's not in there.

[01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:54.150]
I got it somewhere.

[01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:56.390]
And number ten, the Beach Boys.

[01:04:56.890 --> 01:05:02.130]
So in other words, all these other people, Supreme, Frankie Lyman and teenagers, the four

[01:05:02.130 --> 01:05:05.490]
seasons, they're all better than the Beach Boys, according to this musical expert, this

[01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:05.770]
Maven.

[01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.230]
And Errol Smith don't even make it.

[01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:10.130]
Doesn't even make the list.

[01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:11.870]
Oh, and by the way, guess what else?

[01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:13.070]
Doesn't make the list Elton John.

[01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:17.910]
Now, is that debatable that Elton John is better than the Supreme?

[01:05:18.090 --> 01:05:20.570]
Is there any doubt about that or Frankie Lyman and the teenagers?

[01:05:21.090 --> 01:05:23.570]
I mean, maybe he's not as butchers Frankie Lyman, but nevertheless.

[01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:25.190]
Oh.

[01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:28.110]
And not only that, he don't even have the back street boy.

[01:05:30.270 --> 01:05:31.550]
Here is a surf side.

[01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.810]
Hello.

[01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:32.570]
Hey, now.

[01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:33.170]
Yes, sir.

[01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:37.470]
Do you know the results are in for the three most terminal South Dakota talk show host of

[01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:37.950]
all time?

[01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.150]
Yeah.

[01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:45.150]
Three Stanley, the Lepicon major, number two Joe Ibrass, the Kacky and number one George

[01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:46.150]
Jorge Rodriguez.

[01:05:47.330 --> 01:05:48.970]
That's the Boca-Breingra.

[01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:51.730]
So you're just a total asshole already yesterday.

[01:05:52.350 --> 01:05:53.310]
They're taking care of you.

[01:05:53.310 --> 01:05:55.190]
Oh, you're going to be taking care of so okay, just an after that.

[01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:56.030]
Just take close to home.

[01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:56.770]
They'll come and get you.

[01:05:57.030 --> 01:05:57.550]
They got the butterfly.

[01:05:57.550 --> 01:05:58.790]
And the guys coming to get this one.

[01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:01.650]
They can take him to the same place that we had that other old fart that kept calling

[01:06:01.650 --> 01:06:04.650]
with the death threats on everybody in the building, even people that live across the street.

[01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:07.070]
He was even training the people over KFC next door.

[01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:12.170]
Lot of rea sand bizarre people out there and we round them up.

[01:06:12.290 --> 01:06:14.290]
It's the roundup time at the okay corral.

[01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:20.190]
Two open lines and Broward one and date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:25.670]
How come the guy who facts this by the way doesn't have the coins to call for obvious reasons I think you'd be in

[01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:30.390]
Paris to Frankie Lyman in the teenagers number eight that had one hit.

[01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:34.050]
That was a yeah, it was okay.

[01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:36.670]
I can remember it.

[01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:37.970]
I could sing it.

[01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:41.350]
Here's Miami.

[01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:41.730]
Hello.

[01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:43.250]
Back.

[01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:44.050]
Yes.

[01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:46.870]
Yeah, congratulations.

[01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:49.950]
I'm 23 and your numbers and those great numbers.

[01:06:50.110 --> 01:06:52.070]
What did we learn from my doctor by the way anything?

[01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:52.290]
No.

[01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:53.430]
Did we learn a thing?

[01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:54.670]
Did we learn a single thing?

[01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:55.690]
He's a great guy.

[01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:56.410]
I like doctor.

[01:06:56.410 --> 01:07:00.590]
Mark, he's a super guy, but he keeps telling me this is nothing and just you feel great.

[01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:01.990]
You take vitamins.

[01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:03.250]
What do you mean?

[01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:05.030]
I take vitamins all the time.

[01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:05.350]
Okay.

[01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.970]
All right.

[01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:07.550]
And what can I say?

[01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:08.850]
Meaning what about the eagle?

[01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:10.210]
What happened to the eagles?

[01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:11.830]
Not on the list?

[01:07:11.830 --> 01:07:14.110]
The eagles, they had a bad year, man.

[01:07:14.610 --> 01:07:16.030]
Oh, you mean the...

[01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:16.250]
The correct.

[01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:16.650]
Yeah.

[01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:19.190]
Eagles are not one of the top 10.

[01:07:19.290 --> 01:07:19.570]
They're good.

[01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:22.490]
They're certainly better than Frankie Lyman in the teenagers.

[01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:24.690]
Well, I'll put John was in the group, right?

[01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:26.710]
No, this is just recording artists.

[01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:27.670]
I got you.

[01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:28.070]
Okay.

[01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:30.130]
The fat stamina wasn't the group.

[01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:31.770]
He was the biggest the group, but he wasn't the group.

[01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:32.410]
I need to wait.

[01:07:32.650 --> 01:07:33.290]
I liked him.

[01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:34.210]
Thanks a lot.

[01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:37.490]
I had a thing happen at the bank.

[01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:38.110]
Yes.

[01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:40.270]
I got two checks.

[01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:40.930]
Yeah.

[01:07:42.210 --> 01:07:45.670]
I've been trying to cash him, but every time I go there, I give the guy a break.

[01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:47.470]
I said, is there any funds there?

[01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:48.330]
The guy didn't have any money.

[01:07:49.550 --> 01:07:49.950]
Yeah.

[01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:50.310]
All right.

[01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:53.610]
So, he says there'll be funds there Friday.

[01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:57.210]
So I go to the bank to catch the first one.

[01:07:57.390 --> 01:07:57.650]
Uh-huh.

[01:07:58.050 --> 01:07:59.170]
The teller didn't check.

[01:07:59.570 --> 01:08:00.430]
The second one is his own.

[01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:01.290]
There must be funds.

[01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:02.030]
Try it.

[01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:03.210]
Try the first one.

[01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:03.810]
Yeah.

[01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:04.730]
Try the spuck.

[01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:05.730]
Yes, the text.

[01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:07.310]
There's no funds.

[01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:08.910]
Give me back to money.

[01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:12.670]
I said, yeah, I'm the upshot.

[01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:15.970]
The teller says, give me back to money.

[01:08:15.970 --> 01:08:17.310]
I gave you from the first check.

[01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:20.270]
I said, no, you already gave me that.

[01:08:20.310 --> 01:08:21.450]
That transaction is over.

[01:08:21.850 --> 01:08:21.850]

[01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:25.290]
So I said, give me back the check.

[01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:26.750]
You say there's no funds.

[01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:27.050]
Yeah.

[01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:28.490]
She wouldn't give it back to me.

[01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:28.790]
Yeah.

[01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:31.670]
I reached over the counter and I grabbed one of the checks.

[01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:34.030]
Well, it was the one that she cashed.

[01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:35.510]
I will not give it to you.

[01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:37.750]
She says, I'm going to hit you in a mouth.

[01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:38.630]
I will not give it to you.

[01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:40.310]
I said, please hit me in a mouth.

[01:08:40.530 --> 01:08:40.850]
Please.

[01:08:41.530 --> 01:08:41.590]
Yeah.

[01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:43.450]
We got the counter.

[01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:45.250]
I had to wait 10 minutes, right?

[01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.590]
Yeah.

[01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:48.150]
If I had to wait any longer, I'm calling the police.

[01:08:48.370 --> 01:08:49.110]
I called the police.

[01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:49.410]
Yeah.

[01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:50.630]
I called the police.

[01:08:50.770 --> 01:08:51.750]
The police came.

[01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:52.810]
You printed all out.

[01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:54.430]
I got my first check.

[01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:55.170]
What you gave me.

[01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:55.330]
Yeah.

[01:08:55.330 --> 01:08:55.990]
I got my check back.

[01:08:56.010 --> 01:08:56.570]
Okay, nice going.

[01:08:58.190 --> 01:08:59.950]
Okay, so in other words, when it's threatened them,

[01:09:00.150 --> 01:09:02.230]
either threatened to beat the crap out of them and call a cops

[01:09:02.230 --> 01:09:03.170]
or else they'll just give up.

[01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:04.610]
What was he saying?

[01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:05.250]
Is anybody know?

[01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.610]
No.

[01:09:05.830 --> 01:09:06.430]
Killed some good time.

[01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:08.150]
We have a ballgame coming up in an hour and 10 minutes.

[01:09:08.150 --> 01:09:09.370]
Anybody interested in that at all?

[01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:09.490]
No.

[01:09:09.610 --> 01:09:10.130]
Any interest?

[01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:11.250]
Eight minute interest.

[01:09:11.330 --> 01:09:13.030]
The Marlins in the Tampa Bay Devil Raid?

[01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.250]
No.

[01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:13.590]
None.

[01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:14.230]
Zero.

[01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:15.570]
I mean, less than none.

[01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:19.330]
Good thing we got this good trend, a good January to build a base on

[01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:22.390]
for this fall, this winter rating book, whatever they call it,

[01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.810]
winter book.

[01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:25.450]
Because, boy, once we get all these Marlin games,

[01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:27.430]
the exhibitionist games, then the regular season games,

[01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:29.190]
then screwing things up in the middle of the daytime.

[01:09:29.610 --> 01:09:29.830]
Boy.

[01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:33.070]
Now, I guess this is just what the doctor ordered.

[01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:34.690]
He had to get hangstumbers back up where they belong.

[01:09:34.690 --> 01:09:36.550]
Good old Marlin exhibitionist games.

[01:09:37.330 --> 01:09:38.270]
That was a good idea.

[01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:38.510]
That was good for him.

[01:09:38.530 --> 01:09:39.170]
Thank you, Jeff 201.

[01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:41.630]
Well, it's my strength, excuse me.

[01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:51.030]
Well, it's that West Gauille Webbit.

[01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:55.090]
Uh-huh, Webbit.

[01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:57.570]
Come out with your hands up.

[01:09:58.010 --> 01:09:58.350]
Don't shoot.

[01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:59.870]
Don't, don't shoot.

[01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:01.670]
Please, why didn't Quentin?

[01:10:02.290 --> 01:10:03.970]
What are you doing out here?

[01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:05.810]
I'm on the prowl.

[01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:08.050]
I'll show you.

[01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:08.370]
Am I?

[01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:10.890]
I am hunting for Webbit.

[01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:11.730]
Really?

[01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:17.330]
Well, hunting for Webbits is nice, but I'm hunting for something a little more gratifying

[01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:18.650]
than Webbits.

[01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:20.830]
Well, gratifying than Webbit.

[01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:22.910]
What's that, Mr. President?

[01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:24.050]
Labor.

[01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:27.810]
Oh, that sounds very exciting.

[01:10:28.570 --> 01:10:30.530]
Beavers have such a nice help.

[01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:31.810]
Yes, we do.

[01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:36.770]
And a big wild tail, a round ass, you get a lot of that.

[01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:38.670]
And a voluacious appetite.

[01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.290]
Woo!

[01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:41.590]
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

[01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.950]
Really?

[01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:45.110]
I got enough wood in my pants to feed army of beavers.

[01:10:45.390 --> 01:10:46.050]
Let's go.

[01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:47.870]
Do you have a wife on?

[01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:48.450]
Nope.

[01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:52.130]
All I need to get beaver is my boy's good looks.

[01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:53.210]
And this.

[01:10:53.890 --> 01:10:54.750]
Oh my.

[01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:58.370]
That's the craziest looking wife who I ever saw.

[01:10:58.770 --> 01:10:59.790]
Well, it's a little crooked.

[01:10:59.790 --> 01:11:01.710]
But it gets the job done.

[01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:04.830]
I don't see how you ever shoot beaver with that thing.

[01:11:05.170 --> 01:11:06.430]
The key to shooting beaver.

[01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:10.510]
Is you got to get right on top of the sound whiskey?

[01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:11.410]
Shh.

[01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:15.010]
That's Mill beaver.

[01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:17.690]
What do we do now, Mr. Poison?

[01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:19.410]
Give me that breath spray.

[01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:21.330]
Just do what I do.

[01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:23.890]
Oh, oh, baby.

[01:11:25.450 --> 01:11:26.490]
Oh, oh, oh.

[01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:27.750]
Oh, yeah.

[01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:29.630]
Oh, my.

[01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:36.650]
Oh, baby.

[01:11:37.090 --> 01:11:38.290]
I like it.

[01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:38.550]
What?

[01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:40.570]
That was some good beaver, Elmer.

[01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:41.210]
Yes.

[01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:47.090]
Heba is where we good eating Mr. Poison and a hell of a lot less filling than rabbit.

[01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:58.270]
It's 11 before noon at 5.

[01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:59.070]
I'm going to have 60 WQM.

[01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:01.330]
Anyway, you know, an hour ago I was threatening to do something.

[01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:03.490]
I forgot all about it because we had so much crap going on here.

[01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:04.550]
And then Dr. Mark called in.

[01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:06.770]
Kill the audience and you're killing me too, Doc.

[01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:08.550]
He's a good guy.

[01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:09.770]
He didn't tell you anything.

[01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:11.370]
This guy can expand more words.

[01:12:13.150 --> 01:12:16.390]
He's like, you know, I'm not saying anything.

[01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:19.250]
The only thing I know is that he spoke to the other guy.

[01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:22.730]
Now I don't have to waste my time calling my friend Stanley and I know nothing.

[01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:28.350]
Well, it's a, it's a non-specific nebulous.

[01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:33.130]
Like the time when he came to the hockey game, Dr. Mark, he looked at my neck and he said,

[01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:34.470]
that could be a lot of things.

[01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:36.550]
Now, let me ask you this.

[01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:39.530]
Do you need a doctor to look at something like that and say, well, that could be a lot of things.

[01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:45.910]
Anyway, so I was going to look up Rick and Spud and look up Stupid Talk Network, right?

[01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:48.430]
So let's see, Persons 25 to 54.

[01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:53.090]
Let's see how the morning did now that includes a month of Rick and Spud in there.

[01:12:54.150 --> 01:12:56.530]
On W-I-N-Z, 2554.

[01:12:57.450 --> 01:12:59.310]
Our morning went from a two-eight to a 3.1.

[01:12:59.530 --> 01:13:00.990]
Nice going, Joe.

[01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:01.930]
Nice going, Defoe.

[01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:05.110]
Now leave something out.

[01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:06.310]
Okay, let's see.

[01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:07.690]
I'm looking for them.

[01:13:07.810 --> 01:13:08.570]
I'm looking and looking.

[01:13:08.690 --> 01:13:09.230]
Oh, look at that.

[01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:12.650]
From a 0.7 to a 1.1.

[01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:13.050]
Oh!

[01:13:13.450 --> 01:13:13.970]
There you go.

[01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:15.870]
Now still I go test number.

[01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:20.290]
But Rick and Spud's made an upturn there in the morning and it was Rick Riley, of course, who forced himself

[01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:22.830]
out of that show, not people, who wanted to blow them out.

[01:13:23.210 --> 01:13:24.070]
But what about the afternoon?

[01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:27.030]
And here comes, if I'd have a drum roll, but forget it.

[01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:29.310]
Take a new drum roll.

[01:13:31.930 --> 01:13:32.610]
Afternoon.

[01:13:35.130 --> 01:13:39.290]
We're Rick and Spud with the only testosterone at radio station.

[01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:40.290]
Yes, what?

[01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:46.970]
3.4 to a 2.6.

[01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:54.770]
In just one month, he's brought it down almost to full point and dropping like a gigantic

[01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:58.850]
boulder from the top of the world frame center right on the Uranus.

[01:13:59.510 --> 01:14:02.010]
She not only butcher the ratings, she racked them.

[01:14:02.530 --> 01:14:03.910]
Good thing they don't care about numbers up there.

[01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:04.330]
Right.

[01:14:04.810 --> 01:14:06.210]
That's right, because they don't have any.

[01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:13.350]
So just like I predicted, they're going to do better in the morning than whatever else they had before, like John Ford, for example, obviously.

[01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:15.490]
But they're never going to have like a gigantic.

[01:14:15.890 --> 01:14:21.030]
In fact, they'll never have in the morning the number that they had in the afternoon ever in his daily years, unfortunately for them.

[01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:24.690]
And now so now what he'll do is he'll even it out.

[01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:30.750]
Because in the afternoon, I say like by the end when the next time comes out in a month, she'll have that thing under a two.

[01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:32.750]
That's my best guess.

[01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:35.930]
Ed Kaplan's going to have the odds on that tonight, 1030.

[01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:38.330]
Here's a mobile in the Gables, hello.

[01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:39.770]
Yes, sir.

[01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:42.070]
What's wrong with watching golf?

[01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:44.090]
What's wrong with it?

[01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:44.530]
Yeah.

[01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:46.970]
Well, it's like asking me what's wrong with watching paint dry.

[01:14:47.010 --> 01:14:48.970]
I mean, if that's what you like, it's fine, but it's boring.

[01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:51.230]
Well, that's your opinion.

[01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:55.090]
Oh, no, it's coma inducing nice and warm fresh air.

[01:14:55.190 --> 01:15:00.130]
Son, it's better than sitting in a cold thing watching somebody go run on the ice, I think it is.

[01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:00.970]
I think so.

[01:15:01.150 --> 01:15:03.710]
It's more exciting than watching a hockey game watching golf.

[01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:05.210]
Well, people watch baseball.

[01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.470]
Yeah.

[01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:08.810]
I mean, that's not exciting as hockey.

[01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.310]
I agree.

[01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:13.630]
But you're talking me the golf is as exciting as hockey.

[01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:14.350]
What a joke.

[01:15:14.850 --> 01:15:15.770]
What a joke.

[01:15:16.170 --> 01:15:17.250]
Everybody has an opinion.

[01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:20.830]
I understand, but you really believe that or you just say that to be an O'shop provocateur.

[01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:22.410]
Please tell me you don't really believe that.

[01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:23.870]
No, it's not as exciting.

[01:15:24.090 --> 01:15:24.330]
You're right.

[01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:24.830]
It's a embarrassment.

[01:15:25.170 --> 01:15:25.310]
Yeah.

[01:15:25.690 --> 01:15:26.410]
You know, I mean, you're right.

[01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:27.150]
But I mean, it is.

[01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:27.430]
Well, okay.

[01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:28.130]
Well, thanks for trying.

[01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:28.890]
You must be provocative.

[01:15:29.250 --> 01:15:29.430]
Okay.

[01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.990]
Not working.

[01:15:31.650 --> 01:15:32.310]
Nobody's that dumb.

[01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:34.090]
We have an open line and date one and Broward.

[01:15:34.210 --> 01:15:37.550]
5 6 7 0 5 60, 0 5 60, 0 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:37.830]
Come on.

[01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:39.530]
Let's hear it for Frankie Lyman and the teenagers.

[01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:40.330]
Let's hear it.

[01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:41.730]
Some of you, uh, where were they from?

[01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:42.850]
New York, Philly, where were they from?

[01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:44.750]
Oh, that's right.

[01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:46.210]
Now somebody's okay.

[01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:53.590]
All right.

[01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:55.530]
Oh, here's the drifters.

[01:15:56.890 --> 01:15:57.930]
How about about the drifters?

[01:15:58.130 --> 01:16:00.210]
I mean, the drifters are not one of the 10 best groups of all time,

[01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:03.270]
but they sure as hell beat the snot out of Frankie Lyman and the queen teenagers.

[01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:05.170]
How about Peter Frampton?

[01:16:06.970 --> 01:16:07.090]
Huh?

[01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.610]
Not one of the top 10, but certainly better than Frankie Lyman.

[01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:11.810]
Hi, I love Peter Frampton.

[01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:14.250]
She's a great county frances.

[01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:16.930]
Lipstick on your county.

[01:16:16.930 --> 01:16:19.750]
Yeah, I mean bubble gum, but I like kind of four, four tops.

[01:16:20.130 --> 01:16:22.990]
Four tops demand leaves off his list puts in the supreme.

[01:16:23.130 --> 01:16:23.510]
Okay.

[01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:25.890]
Leaves off the temptations.

[01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:28.350]
Is there any doubt the temptations are better than the supreme?

[01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:29.410]
Is there any contest?

[01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:29.810]
No.

[01:16:31.530 --> 01:16:36.510]
Plus, by the way, George had three different people off the air calling and taking credit for sending that back.

[01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:38.210]
And I'm sure none of them were the real one.

[01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:42.350]
So what would this be under because it's not under, I guess, maybe Lyman.

[01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:44.530]
Lyman disease.

[01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:45.950]
What we're just talking about that.

[01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:50.490]
Okay, there's certainly not going to be in the most hit.

[01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:52.630]
Oh, look at that Robin Luke, Susie Darling.

[01:16:52.850 --> 01:16:53.730]
Boy, I love Robin Luke.

[01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.590]

[01:16:55.730 --> 01:16:56.350]
Let's see.

[01:16:57.130 --> 01:16:58.110]
Who am I looking for?

[01:16:58.210 --> 01:16:58.830]
It's not in here.

[01:17:00.130 --> 01:17:01.170]
Our Arthur Lyman.

[01:17:01.230 --> 01:17:01.790]
Oh, here it is.

[01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.390]
All right.

[01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:03.090]
About time.

[01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:03.810]
Well, that's right.

[01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:05.970]
I forgot that other one they had that would now also have the record.

[01:17:05.970 --> 01:17:07.270]
You know what the other one is?

[01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:12.430]
What's that big records to a Sam Goodie?

[01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:13.330]
Goodie.

[01:17:13.770 --> 01:17:14.990]
Goodie, goodie, goodie, goodie.

[01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.550]
Goodie, goodie.

[01:17:16.730 --> 01:17:17.230]
That's right.

[01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:19.550]
That would reach number seven, number 20.

[01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:21.870]
It had peaks of 20 years.

[01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:23.250]
It reached number 20 on the chart.

[01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:28.390]
But the only big hit they had, of course, was White of Fools Fall in Love February of 1956.

[01:17:29.170 --> 01:17:31.150]
33 years ago today, just about.

[01:17:31.190 --> 01:17:31.530]
Oh!

[01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:34.190]
Reach number six, 21 weeks on the chart.

[01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:37.850]
Then they had some other, I want you to be my girl, which I never heard of.

[01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:39.250]
I don't think I never heard of that.

[01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:42.350]
Reach number 13, but I never heard of it.

[01:17:43.210 --> 01:17:44.430]
And some other marginal stuff.

[01:17:44.610 --> 01:17:45.510]
The goodie, goodie, was pretty good.

[01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:46.990]
And little, pretty, pretty one.

[01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:52.290]
Which, uh, Thurston Harris was that, that was, that was the guy that had the hit.

[01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:54.650]
Thurmond, Thurmond Harris was the borer.

[01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:55.250]
Let me look it up.

[01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:59.010]
Thurston Harris, little, pretty, pretty one, was number six.

[01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:01.030]
What, why do I know my oldies or what?

[01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:02.270]
I don't know too much else.

[01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:03.390]
I know my old crap.

[01:18:03.610 --> 01:18:06.630]
When you're an old fossil like I am, you know what you're old crap.

[01:18:07.670 --> 01:18:09.230]
You can't take one, but you know it.

[01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:10.330]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:10.670]
Hello.

[01:18:11.230 --> 01:18:11.690]
Hey, Neil.

[01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:12.110]
How you doing?

[01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:12.470]
Great.

[01:18:13.330 --> 01:18:16.650]
First of all, congratulations on 23 years of kicking ass in this town.

[01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:18.410]
You are certainly the man.

[01:18:18.730 --> 01:18:19.250]
Yes, I am.

[01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:19.810]
Thank you.

[01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:21.750]
Second of all, major bacon report.

[01:18:22.050 --> 01:18:24.350]
The Florida Ijo Pusas are gathered around.

[01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:30.270]
They're gathered around softball on the, softdown on the dunchula at Perehuay.

[01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:33.310]
They're just all over the place.

[01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:36.950]
Yeah, they're in a feeding frenzy that they were in plantation acres this morning.

[01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.890]
They were on every street corner.

[01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:40.270]
They were shooting it and they were out of control all everywhere.

[01:18:40.810 --> 01:18:41.810]
Must be quota month.

[01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.530]
Yeah, must be.

[01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:43.710]
Well, that's right.

[01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:44.510]
It's the fifth of March.

[01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:45.530]
It's the I'd of March.

[01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:47.130]
So that must be it.

[01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:51.250]
And I'm now in line waiting to get it rammed up my tailpipe.

[01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:57.590]
As I contribute my $10 to that scam of the Florida Pollution Control.

[01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:58.190]
Oh, right.

[01:18:58.190 --> 01:18:58.670]
Okay.

[01:18:59.150 --> 01:19:01.650]
Say, say, how do I say legalarians, by the way?

[01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:03.050]
And one more thing is closing.

[01:19:03.190 --> 01:19:04.210]
Some of those baseball so tight.

[01:19:04.330 --> 01:19:04.430]
Yes.

[01:19:04.890 --> 01:19:06.550]
And imposing Twitter hit people mask.

[01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:08.750]
Oh no, in Miami, I'm out of material.

[01:19:08.890 --> 01:19:09.390]
All right.

[01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:10.170]
Okay, I'll rebe it.

[01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:10.310]
I'll be there.

[01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:13.410]
We have an open line and date one and Broward.

[01:19:13.410 --> 01:19:13.590]
Come on.

[01:19:13.650 --> 01:19:15.190]
Let's hear about Frankie Leibon and the teenagers.

[01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:17.410]
Let's hear from the asshole that really sent this facts.

[01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:17.810]
Okay.

[01:19:17.890 --> 01:19:21.830]
I can't believe that anybody is probably again just trying to be a, you know, a provocative

[01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:22.410]
tour.

[01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:28.890]
The Neil Roger Show on 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale.

[01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:29.510]
I have no idea.

[01:19:29.610 --> 01:19:32.870]
Come on down to shotbuster video and get the shock of your life.

[01:19:33.130 --> 01:19:35.830]
Hi, do you have a copy of Rambo?

[01:19:36.030 --> 01:19:37.490]
Do you mean to tell me you haven't seen Rambo?

[01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:37.730]
Yes.

[01:19:38.010 --> 01:19:38.950]
That's too sexy for you.

[01:19:39.150 --> 01:19:39.390]
You win.

[01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:39.970]
I'm sorry.

[01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:43.430]
Check out shotbuster's huge selection.

[01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:45.230]
Hey, lady, where you hiding the skin flex?

[01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:46.150]
Get it, quick.

[01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:48.290]
I'm gonna shot your fat ass.

[01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:51.490]
At shotbuster, we pride ourselves on our knowledgeable staff.

[01:19:51.490 --> 01:19:52.230]
Excuse me, doc.

[01:19:52.450 --> 01:19:53.730]
Do you have any copies of Jacob Lutter?

[01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:54.990]
Oh, that movie was crap.

[01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:57.850]
You know, the main character of all of you said the whole time and you didn't even know it.

[01:19:57.850 --> 01:19:58.990]
Oh, you're the role of it for me.

[01:19:59.090 --> 01:19:59.870]
I can't believe how.

[01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.890]
Oh, you're crazy, how.

[01:20:01.050 --> 01:20:02.590]
And don't forget the children.

[01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:04.790]
We have a large selection for them too.

[01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:06.310]
Jackie, don't stare at the lady.

[01:20:06.490 --> 01:20:07.150]
Please, let's not lie.

[01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:08.650]
Daddy, she looks funny.

[01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.830]
Oh, am I?

[01:20:10.090 --> 01:20:11.150]
Come here, you little bastard.

[01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:11.910]
I'll take care of you.

[01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:12.310]
You're the little.

[01:20:12.370 --> 01:20:16.110]
At shotbuster, you're also guaranteed the greatest crisis in time.

[01:20:16.230 --> 01:20:16.910]
Oh, let's be now.

[01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:18.710]
You had five movies at four days.

[01:20:19.190 --> 01:20:20.410]
At 144, honestly.

[01:20:20.410 --> 01:20:22.870]
And I thought I'd have a senior student discount.

[01:20:23.190 --> 01:20:24.730]
I don't have the kind of money on me.

[01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:26.450]
Well, also you want.

[01:20:26.670 --> 01:20:27.670]
Is that your husband over there?

[01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:28.230]
Yes.

[01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:31.890]
How about if we show his goddamn dangerous grab-up?

[01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:32.510]
Take that.

[01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:33.330]
And that.

[01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:33.970]
That's a-

[01:20:33.970 --> 01:20:35.110]
That's a luxury video.

[01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:36.350]
What a difference.

[01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:39.410]
Come on one at five, 60 WQAM.

[01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:44.410]
We got to Marlins and the 10th of a Devil Rays in which there is absolutely no interest whatsoever.

[01:20:44.710 --> 01:20:46.130]
Preseason baseball at 1250.

[01:20:46.230 --> 01:20:46.650]
This hour.

[01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:48.450]
Less than one hour away.

[01:20:48.450 --> 01:20:50.610]
We also have lunch from it's an Oteca and upwards show.

[01:20:50.710 --> 01:20:51.790]
I hope it's very soon by the way.

[01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:54.090]
We don't want to get pushy, but I hate to eat and run.

[01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:54.850]
You know how that is?

[01:20:55.210 --> 01:20:56.670]
We have an open line of day one and an hour.

[01:20:56.790 --> 01:21:00.430]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0.5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:01.890]
Here's South Beach.

[01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.190]
Hello.

[01:21:02.670 --> 01:21:03.130]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:05.570]
The other day something happened across the street from my house.

[01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:07.410]
Yesterday, there was some shooting or stuff.

[01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:10.450]
And the cops were all over my lawns.

[01:21:11.150 --> 01:21:13.490]
They picked me up my window and they saw a bong there.

[01:21:14.150 --> 01:21:15.770]
They came in and they took me to jail.

[01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:16.710]
So they took me to jail.

[01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:18.990]
I hope they put you away for a long time.

[01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:20.270]
Another story guy.

[01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:22.810]
We have an open line and Broward to and date.

[01:21:22.810 --> 01:21:26.210]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 and pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:29.450]
Here's Sunrise.

[01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:29.790]
Hello.

[01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:31.510]
It's my list.

[01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:34.210]
I'm the proof of it, you got the paper in front of you.

[01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.490]
Yeah.

[01:21:34.670 --> 01:21:36.390]
You see the pen scratch after Domino?

[01:21:36.570 --> 01:21:36.970]
Right, yes.

[01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.970]
This guy, this is the guy.

[01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:39.330]
Okay, that's good.

[01:21:39.730 --> 01:21:40.050]
All right.

[01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:42.470]
I also want to save before we get on the way.

[01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:42.970]
Let me say it again.

[01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:45.350]
That part is good, but the list itself is really good.

[01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:46.330]
You can get on the way.

[01:21:46.450 --> 01:21:48.070]
You know, we can have some discussion on this.

[01:21:48.150 --> 01:21:49.170]
Yes, verbal intercourse.

[01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:53.590]
You took some pock shots at me and you said it didn't have the onions to call you while I'm sitting here.

[01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.990]
Very good.

[01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:55.190]
At least give me credit for that.

[01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:56.150]
Yeah, I give you a lot of credit.

[01:21:56.530 --> 01:21:57.910]
I'll give you any credit for the list though.

[01:21:57.930 --> 01:21:58.650]
I give you credit for that.

[01:21:58.750 --> 01:21:59.530]
It's a damn good list.

[01:21:59.550 --> 01:22:00.830]
As a matter of fact, I give you a lot of credit.

[01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:03.890]
Anybody that would send this list and would call, I give you extra credit.

[01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:09.570]
Well, it's amazing that two other, I heard George during the break, two other people tried to take credit for this list.

[01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:10.110]
Yeah.

[01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:11.030]
It's my list.

[01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.570]
Right.

[01:22:11.690 --> 01:22:12.430]
It's a damn good list.

[01:22:12.490 --> 01:22:14.030]
Well, they're just O'shaan Prabhakitorum.

[01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:15.570]
Well, it's probably true to them.

[01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:15.970]
What's going on?

[01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:17.850]
I noticed that as a damn good list.

[01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:18.770]
It's a damn good list.

[01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:21.330]
Frankie Lyman and the three neighbors who had one hit.

[01:22:21.450 --> 01:22:22.550]
They did not have one hit.

[01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:23.770]
They had one bona fide hit.

[01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:24.570]
No, they didn't.

[01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:25.670]
They had one top 10 hit.

[01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:26.390]
No, they didn't.

[01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:27.130]
What was the other one?

[01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:30.230]
I promised to read it just because you never heard of them.

[01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:31.450]
That doesn't mean that they weren't.

[01:22:31.450 --> 01:22:32.870]
I had the book right here.

[01:22:33.090 --> 01:22:33.430]
I gave it.

[01:22:33.670 --> 01:22:35.030]
I think it's got through a listing year.

[01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.190]
You ready?

[01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:36.210]
Are you ready?

[01:22:36.670 --> 01:22:37.750]
Top 10 hits, yes.

[01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:40.590]
I promised to remember number 10 hit from 56.

[01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:42.890]
I want you to be my girl.

[01:22:42.890 --> 01:22:44.990]
Number three, 1956.

[01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.790]
Wrong.

[01:22:45.970 --> 01:22:46.930]
The ABC's of love.

[01:22:46.930 --> 01:22:47.030]
Wrong.

[01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:51.590]
ABC's of love reached number 77 was the peak.

[01:22:51.930 --> 01:22:52.910]
Well, these are the...

[01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:54.050]
These are the R&D list.

[01:22:54.150 --> 01:22:56.530]
I want you to be my girl reached number 13.

[01:22:57.090 --> 01:22:57.910]
And what was the other one?

[01:22:58.410 --> 01:22:59.910]
Well, I'm going by the R&D list.

[01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:01.490]
But forget about the R&D list.

[01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:02.530]
Well, that's the list I'm going by.

[01:23:02.530 --> 01:23:04.250]
Then narrowed them down in the way.

[01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:05.710]
Much more narrow category.

[01:23:05.930 --> 01:23:07.390]
They can't be...

[01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:07.990]
Well, that's...

[01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.270]
It's Neil.

[01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:11.690]
Back then, you know, how things were the way they listed records and stuff.

[01:23:11.690 --> 01:23:13.870]
If you were back alive in the Teenagers,

[01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.630]
you're serious.

[01:23:14.630 --> 01:23:16.690]
Are they at best recording their history?

[01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.710]
Yes.

[01:23:18.170 --> 01:23:22.850]
Because they were pioneers in the industry.

[01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:23.890]
Pioneers in what?

[01:23:24.170 --> 01:23:27.590]
In the recording industry of early R&D and rock and roll.

[01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:31.130]
They weren't pioneers at all.

[01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:31.790]
Yes, they were.

[01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:32.710]
Absolutely not.

[01:23:33.010 --> 01:23:33.190]
Yes, sir.

[01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:34.930]
They were formed.

[01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:35.530]
They were formed.

[01:23:36.050 --> 01:23:37.130]
We're going to have a conversation.

[01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:38.030]
You're going to get hostile.

[01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:39.130]
I don't know yet.

[01:23:39.130 --> 01:23:43.190]
They formed as the premieres in 1955 in the Bronx, New York.

[01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:47.490]
Leadsinger Frankie Laman was born September 30, 1942 in New York.

[01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:50.790]
Died of drug overdose on February 28, 1958.

[01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:51.830]
All correct.

[01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:56.190]
Other members included Herman Santiago and Jimmy Merchant, Joe Narni,

[01:23:56.410 --> 01:23:57.610]
and Sherman Games.

[01:23:57.970 --> 01:24:00.730]
Group appeared in movies Rock Rock Rock and Mr. Rock and Roll.

[01:24:01.190 --> 01:24:03.470]
Group inducted into the Rock and Roll of Famine 1993.

[01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:06.450]
And they started listing people.

[01:24:06.450 --> 01:24:09.770]
Not that I believe 100% in the Rock and Roll of Famine.

[01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:12.110]
But they started listing people in 86.

[01:24:13.050 --> 01:24:13.930]
So it only took time.

[01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:17.290]
And you're serious that you think that Frankie Laman and the teenagers

[01:24:17.290 --> 01:24:20.650]
were better recording artists than Aerosmith just to pick one?

[01:24:20.910 --> 01:24:21.330]
Yes, sir.

[01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:22.550]
Yes, sir.

[01:24:22.630 --> 01:24:24.070]
And I'll tell you something about it.

[01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:27.470]
You can do a couple of shots at me about the temptations.

[01:24:27.710 --> 01:24:29.850]
I agree with you, but I only have 10 slots.

[01:24:30.210 --> 01:24:30.950]
If there were 15 here.

[01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:32.930]
So how come they're not on here at all?

[01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:34.010]
And you got the Supreme's in here.

[01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:36.850]
Of all the Motown groups, you got the Primes and Marvin Gaye.

[01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:38.190]
Because the Primes don't belong in the list.

[01:24:38.290 --> 01:24:38.870]
Yes, they do.

[01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:39.610]
Not in no way.

[01:24:39.670 --> 01:24:43.430]
And to say that 20% of the list goes to Motown as a hell of an eximate.

[01:24:43.770 --> 01:24:44.410]
How about the four tops?

[01:24:45.010 --> 01:24:46.090]
The four tops are great.

[01:24:46.250 --> 01:24:47.430]
Not better than the Supremes.

[01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.870]
No, sir.

[01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:48.790]
Oh, no.

[01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:49.450]
God.

[01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:52.170]
You got to remember how many recording artists there are.

[01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:54.850]
And you're talking about the Frankie Laman and the teenagers

[01:24:54.850 --> 01:24:56.370]
are better than the Beach Boys?

[01:24:56.710 --> 01:24:57.110]
Yes, sir.

[01:24:57.570 --> 01:24:57.830]
Oh!

[01:24:58.190 --> 01:24:58.730]
Yes, sir.

[01:24:59.630 --> 01:25:00.890]
Oh, my God.

[01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:02.490]
I can't believe it.

[01:25:02.490 --> 01:25:03.310]
Can I ask you a question?

[01:25:04.410 --> 01:25:05.990]
Can I ask you a question?

[01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:06.230]
No.

[01:25:06.230 --> 01:25:06.410]
Can I ask you a question?

[01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:08.430]
You know something, Carl Wilson is spinning in his grave.

[01:25:08.430 --> 01:25:09.730]
I love the cradle right now.

[01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:10.450]
I love the cradle.

[01:25:10.450 --> 01:25:10.610]
I love the cradle.

[01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:10.830]
You're spinning it.

[01:25:11.050 --> 01:25:11.270]
There.

[01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.850]
I love him.

[01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:13.310]
But let me tell you something.

[01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:15.350]
What's even more ridiculous than that?

[01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:17.350]
And I hate to disagree with the King.

[01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:17.790]
Yeah.

[01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:21.470]
How could you figure in your mind to put aerospace in that top 10?

[01:25:21.690 --> 01:25:22.070]
Easily.

[01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:22.790]
No way.

[01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:23.990]
And I'll tell you why.

[01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.430]
You got L.

[01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:25.290]
I got L.

[01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.430]

[01:25:25.690 --> 01:25:26.510]
Pressley in here?

[01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:27.170]
Yes, sir.

[01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:28.390]
I could tell you why.

[01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:29.370]
You're going to get angry.

[01:25:29.370 --> 01:25:30.730]
Oh, my God.

[01:25:30.810 --> 01:25:31.310]
I'll tell you why.

[01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:32.470]
And you're going to get angry.

[01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:33.310]
Why, tell you about aerospace?

[01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:34.230]
I'm angry already.

[01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.630]
All right.

[01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:40.070]
To me, when I think of aerospace, I think of a group that formed in the 70s.

[01:25:40.090 --> 01:25:40.230]
Yeah.

[01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:42.170]
They had a couple of hit albums.

[01:25:42.850 --> 01:25:43.710]
A couple of hit albums.

[01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:44.070]
And it.

[01:25:44.250 --> 01:25:49.790]
Boys in the ad, if a couple of hit albums died for 15 years and they had come back in the early 90s.

[01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:51.770]
I mean, you really want to have this discussion?

[01:25:51.890 --> 01:25:55.110]
They remind me of a group like Boston or one of these kind of groups.

[01:25:55.170 --> 01:25:55.670]
Where do I do it in the book?

[01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:57.990]
Where's my book, George?

[01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:59.610]
Oh, here it is.

[01:26:00.150 --> 01:26:01.210]
Keeping it out handy.

[01:26:01.290 --> 01:26:02.250]
And I'm waiting for you.

[01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:04.270]
They remind you of Boston.

[01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:06.630]
Yes, they're a group that had a couple of hit albums.

[01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:08.390]
Boston is like a bubblegum group.

[01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:09.930]
But they're the same.

[01:26:10.210 --> 01:26:10.930]
They're one of the things.

[01:26:11.150 --> 01:26:11.270]
Okay.

[01:26:12.690 --> 01:26:15.170]
They had a couple of hit albums in the 70s.

[01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:19.190]
They were dead for 15 years and they came back in the early 90s.

[01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:19.950]
Dream on.

[01:26:20.170 --> 01:26:20.810]
Sweet emotion.

[01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:23.030]
These were 73, 75, 76.

[01:26:23.290 --> 01:26:25.730]
Last child walked this way, number 10 and 76.

[01:26:25.890 --> 01:26:26.670]
Well, let me ask you this.

[01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:27.070]
Yeah.

[01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:29.330]
Where were they in the 80s?

[01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:30.410]
Where were they in the 80s?

[01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:31.170]
I had to first.

[01:26:31.470 --> 01:26:32.150]
They were all, that's right.

[01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:33.230]
They were all doing drugs, right?

[01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:34.770]
Well, where were they?

[01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:36.010]
Well, what do they mean does that make?

[01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:38.710]
Well, you're telling me, I'm in the teenagers in the 80s.

[01:26:38.710 --> 01:26:39.530]
Well, you said that.

[01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:39.530]

[01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:40.450]
Yeah, dead.

[01:26:40.810 --> 01:26:41.730]
Yeah, well, for what?

[01:26:42.250 --> 01:26:43.470]
Well, you're trying to tell me that you got a...

[01:26:43.470 --> 01:26:45.870]
Remember, walking in a sand, dude looks like a lady.

[01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:49.330]
Angel, which reached number three in 88, ragdoll.

[01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:50.870]
Love it in elevator, which was 89.

[01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:53.530]
Janie's got a gun, which reached number four in 89.

[01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:55.350]
What it takes, reach number nine.

[01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:58.970]
Living on the edge, crying, amazing, crazy, blind man.

[01:26:59.230 --> 01:27:00.790]
And then the new one from Armageddon that they got there,

[01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:02.670]
reached number one in 99.

[01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:04.950]
Buddy, they're not top 10 material.

[01:27:05.250 --> 01:27:05.530]
Oh.

[01:27:05.770 --> 01:27:06.070]
No way.

[01:27:06.170 --> 01:27:08.150]
And you're trying to tell me also Peter Frampton?

[01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:09.710]
Peter Frampton?

[01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:10.790]
No, I wouldn't say top 10.

[01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:11.590]
Come on, man.

[01:27:11.670 --> 01:27:13.210]
Better than some of the crap you got on this list.

[01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:13.690]
No way.

[01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:16.350]
Well, like what's named one of those top 10 that is less than...

[01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:19.610]
Other than Frankie Lyman, which I hear you jumping up and down.

[01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:20.730]
One of the other nine.

[01:27:20.850 --> 01:27:21.110]
Elvis.

[01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:22.550]
Get out of here.

[01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:24.810]
Now you understand what you're saying over the air.

[01:27:24.810 --> 01:27:25.250]
Of course.

[01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:26.730]
That's right.

[01:27:26.810 --> 01:27:28.190]
And most of them agree if they have a brain.

[01:27:28.190 --> 01:27:29.250]
Unless they're...

[01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:31.210]
Unless they're dumbies that keep running into Graceland.

[01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:31.490]
What about Chicago?

[01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:32.770]
Because I like Peter, but are in jelly.

[01:27:33.010 --> 01:27:33.670]
I love Chicago.

[01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:34.530]
I agree on that.

[01:27:34.810 --> 01:27:35.650]
And what about the stone?

[01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:37.890]
You got to tell me the stone don't belong in a top 10?

[01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:38.570]
Top 10.

[01:27:38.650 --> 01:27:40.090]
I'll give him like maybe nine or 10.

[01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.650]
Okay.

[01:27:40.770 --> 01:27:42.170]
So out of the 10 that I've listed,

[01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:43.690]
you know, vehemently disagree.

[01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:46.990]
Elvis, the Supreme's, Frankie Lyman and the Teenagers.

[01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:49.070]
You know how that particular thing makes you sound.

[01:27:49.230 --> 01:27:49.730]
No, it does not.

[01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:52.030]
If you can, you can eliminate Frankie Lyman's Teenagers.

[01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:52.270]
Okay.

[01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:53.210]
That's like borderline.

[01:27:53.210 --> 01:27:54.870]
Four seasons are not one of the top.

[01:27:55.410 --> 01:27:58.090]
To say the four seasons are better than aerospace.

[01:27:58.270 --> 01:28:01.130]
It's like saying that bubble gum is better than filet mignon.

[01:28:01.330 --> 01:28:02.570]
That's how ridiculous that is.

[01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:04.110]
And I love the four seasons.

[01:28:04.210 --> 01:28:08.030]
Frankie Lyman and the four seasons are 60s icons.

[01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:10.150]
So what are aerospace?

[01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:13.010]
So in other words, you're again,

[01:28:13.110 --> 01:28:16.330]
you're going like George likes to do by category or your categorizing.

[01:28:16.530 --> 01:28:21.150]
As opposed to comparing based on what the sound is based on the ability.

[01:28:21.150 --> 01:28:26.450]
The sound I agree with also the four seasons are 100 times better than aerospace.

[01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:28.550]
I don't particularly care for aerospace.

[01:28:28.710 --> 01:28:29.770]
But there's a lot of group.

[01:28:29.770 --> 01:28:30.670]
Oh my God.

[01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:33.730]
Particularly care for that you could argue with me.

[01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:38.350]
To say that Elvis Presley was a better singer than Elton John is like saying that

[01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:41.610]
Gerald Ford was a greater president than Franklin Roosevelt.

[01:28:42.030 --> 01:28:44.070]
Do you think Elton John is a superior singer?

[01:28:44.530 --> 01:28:44.870]
Absolutely.

[01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:46.770]
One of the great artists in history.

[01:28:46.770 --> 01:28:47.750]
And if he's not on the top.

[01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:48.890]
He's a good songwriter.

[01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:49.190]
Yeah.

[01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.890]
And singer.

[01:28:49.890 --> 01:28:50.710]
No, he's not.

[01:28:50.850 --> 01:28:51.890]
And singer and piano.

[01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:53.270]
And entertainer.

[01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:54.750]
And he might be a great entertainer.

[01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:56.290]
That doesn't make a great entertainer either.

[01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.650]
Yeah.

[01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:58.730]
They say Billy Joel is a great entertainer.

[01:28:58.850 --> 01:29:00.750]
I don't think he can sing his way out of a milk cart.

[01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:01.290]
And I agree.

[01:29:01.630 --> 01:29:02.270]
All of these things.

[01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:02.750]
That's right.

[01:29:02.830 --> 01:29:06.310]
But my friend, when you get on the radio and tell people.

[01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:08.110]
My opinion, when I tell people my friend,

[01:29:08.110 --> 01:29:09.850]
that's right, Elvis Presley would not want to have that.

[01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:10.530]
He's not.

[01:29:10.670 --> 01:29:12.070]
He's recording hard with all time.

[01:29:12.170 --> 01:29:12.690]
Not even close.

[01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:14.650]
No, it does not.

[01:29:14.890 --> 01:29:18.310]
It only makes me silly to people who accept things based on what everybody else says.

[01:29:18.490 --> 01:29:19.530]
I'm not interested in that.

[01:29:19.530 --> 01:29:22.530]
I'm not interested in forming my own opinions based on my own senses.

[01:29:22.530 --> 01:29:23.830]
My ears, my brain.

[01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:26.070]
Well, my rectum.

[01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:29.490]
I agree with you on 99.9% of the things you talked about.

[01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:29.730]
Okay.

[01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:30.830]
Well, let me tell you something.

[01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:32.410]
Well, listen, you got bad taste in music.

[01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:33.910]
I have great taste in music.

[01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:34.190]
The worst.

[01:29:34.330 --> 01:29:35.370]
I play music all the time.

[01:29:35.410 --> 01:29:36.810]
Other people to listen to.

[01:29:37.010 --> 01:29:37.190]
Yeah.

[01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:42.570]
But, you know, I vehemently disagree with you on this arosment.

[01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:44.170]
Put him in the carriage or he would boss.

[01:29:44.590 --> 01:29:45.430]
I got to go.

[01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:46.530]
Okay, see ya.

[01:29:48.110 --> 01:29:50.490]
His dog, his pit bulls attack at him for that list.

[01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:51.930]
How about foreigner?

[01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:53.410]
Oh, we got too many of those already.

[01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:55.310]
How about foreigner?

[01:29:55.450 --> 01:29:57.290]
They should be on top 20 list, huh?

[01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.950]
I love foreigner.

[01:29:58.610 --> 01:29:59.450]
Nobody mentioned them.

[01:30:01.090 --> 01:30:01.390]
Elvis.

[01:30:01.690 --> 01:30:02.010]
Presley.

[01:30:02.050 --> 01:30:06.290]
I mean, if you loved Elvis as like, like he said in the icon, I love the way people use that term.

[01:30:06.490 --> 01:30:07.290]
Well, he was an icon.

[01:30:07.630 --> 01:30:07.730]
Yeah.

[01:30:07.890 --> 01:30:09.150]
It was a, it was a hype job.

[01:30:09.290 --> 01:30:09.630]
That's all.

[01:30:09.850 --> 01:30:10.590]
It was ahead of his time.

[01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:12.470]
Like foster he was.

[01:30:12.650 --> 01:30:13.550]
He was ahead of his time.

[01:30:13.710 --> 01:30:14.410]
That didn't make him good.

[01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:18.610]
I like a lot of Elvis's music, but to say that he was one of the,

[01:30:18.630 --> 01:30:21.490]
forget about performers, forget about how many records he sold,

[01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:23.370]
forget about how many he out on the list.

[01:30:23.710 --> 01:30:24.670]
That's not the point.

[01:30:26.770 --> 01:30:28.150]
Popularity doesn't make it great.

[01:30:29.210 --> 01:30:33.050]
And how about, and this guy had a run while the pit bull was chewed off his, whatever he was chewing.

[01:30:33.450 --> 01:30:36.410]
How about the doors to go back to what the other guy was saying.

[01:30:36.690 --> 01:30:40.430]
You tell me that, uh, Frankie Lyman was better than Jim Morrison.

[01:30:41.410 --> 01:30:43.790]
The entire world is going to wonder the dog is barking.

[01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:47.070]
And they're knocking on the door with the, the butterfly net to take this guy away.

[01:30:47.410 --> 01:30:48.790]
He leads out the doors.

[01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:50.410]
Definitely on the top 10.

[01:30:50.890 --> 01:30:51.430]
The doors.

[01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:52.150]
Oh, yes.

[01:30:52.410 --> 01:30:52.730]
Exactly.

[01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:55.970]
In fact, we could redo all the right reasons.

[01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.570]
Right.

[01:30:57.770 --> 01:30:58.390]
That's right.

[01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:01.370]
And then the guy that before that says Jim Morrison couldn't sing.

[01:31:01.770 --> 01:31:02.850]
He ain't singing too good now.

[01:31:05.130 --> 01:31:07.430]
In fact, he's probably on that the singing on record.

[01:31:08.150 --> 01:31:08.590]
Dominique.

[01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:10.790]
Well, he's hanging out in France under the Louvre.

[01:31:11.450 --> 01:31:11.930]
Neil.

[01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:13.030]
God.

[01:31:13.330 --> 01:31:14.190]
Kate Tell, present.

[01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:17.110]
Over 740 Kate of McLean's songs alone.

[01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:20.070]
But especially for the lady in your life, by Cherry Lewis.

[01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:21.150]
Lady.

[01:31:22.230 --> 01:31:24.450]
When I live you, I'm crazy.

[01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:26.030]

[01:31:26.090 --> 01:31:29.550]
How many of songs for your lady, all with Tiffany's, I'd love to make her himself.

[01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:32.190]
And it's a typical superstar at the theater, Cherry Lewis.

[01:31:32.770 --> 01:31:34.310]
And it's your favorite lady's song.

[01:31:34.510 --> 01:31:36.070]
Lady, lady, lady.

[01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:40.050]
Lady, lady, cross by big, red, red.

[01:31:40.050 --> 01:31:48.010]
It's an amazing company of up 748 love songs for your lady, all digitally remastered and all performed by the masterful superstar, Cherry Lewis.

[01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:48.770]
All right.

[01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:51.930]
Cherry, somebody here to join me on K-Cell record.

[01:31:52.490 --> 01:31:55.590]
I'd be saying a very special musical tribute to the lady.

[01:31:56.090 --> 01:31:57.990]
You'll get this arrow-smith classic.

[01:31:58.510 --> 01:32:02.070]
And, and, you look like a lady.

[01:32:02.810 --> 01:32:05.010]
And, and, and, you look like a lady.

[01:32:05.310 --> 01:32:05.610]
It's Cherry.

[01:32:05.610 --> 01:32:09.150]
It's a little old-age with a pair of tweezers.

[01:32:10.210 --> 01:32:12.670]
And, Helen, when he's hit, never sounded better.

[01:32:13.230 --> 01:32:16.050]
That ain't no way to see the lady.

[01:32:16.670 --> 01:32:19.170]
It's a little old-age.

[01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:20.610]
It's a little old-age.

[01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:25.310]
And, listen to Cherry's amazing interpretation of the super hit from the king of pop.

[01:32:25.370 --> 01:32:29.330]
Who are the ladies with my wife today?

[01:32:30.170 --> 01:32:30.930]
The ladies.

[01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:34.770]
Who are the ladies with a night?

[01:32:34.770 --> 01:32:35.930]
Cherry Lewis.

[01:32:36.370 --> 01:32:37.670]
How about that man?

[01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:39.510]
How about that man?

[01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:45.150]
That's 748 love songs on 35 CD, 3128 track tapes.

[01:32:45.630 --> 01:32:48.430]
All revixed, exploited, models from the original cassette masters.

And, it's a collection you'll share with your friends and your lady will miss again.

[01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:55.370]
It's all yours for 17 easy favorites.

[01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:56.670]
It's only 32.95.

[01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:58.230]
And, it's all from K-Cell record.

[01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:02.530]
You can tell in K-Cell, we go.

[01:33:02.530 --> 01:33:07.030]
1218 at 560 WQM, we've got lunch from Ettenote right now and it is outstanding.

[01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:10.350]
I've got Vitello, from Fungi Porcini.

[01:33:11.850 --> 01:33:12.730]
Hey, Sponacci.

[01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:15.630]
Here's my six words of Italian.

[01:33:16.650 --> 01:33:18.350]
And, George says, what do you got to Porcini?

[01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:20.090]
To talk to that.

[01:33:20.130 --> 01:33:20.990]
What a spick.

[01:33:21.150 --> 01:33:21.910]
I'm just repeating it.

[01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:23.070]
What a spick Porcini.

[01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:25.330]
What's that Latino that's you, huh?

[01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:26.550]
What does he know from Italian?

[01:33:27.230 --> 01:33:28.710]
That red face Jew in there.

[01:33:29.310 --> 01:33:29.750]
Porcini.

[01:33:31.690 --> 01:33:34.550]
George is doing, you know, Italian in Espanol.

[01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.910]
Cornesca goal.

[01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:38.790]
We have an open line of date one and brown at 560.05.

[01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:39.530]
60.05.

[01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:40.870]
60 on the mobile one line.

[01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:42.990]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:43.330]
Hello.

[01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:44.390]
Hello, Neil.

[01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:44.910]
Yes, sir.

[01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:45.590]
Yes.

[01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:47.910]
I agree with you about Frankie Lyman.

[01:33:48.010 --> 01:33:50.130]
I think the only hit he ever had was one of the full slow.

[01:33:50.130 --> 01:33:55.150]
That was the only real honest to God bonafide hitting that guy knows it.

[01:33:55.150 --> 01:33:55.630]
And he's got a lot of things to do with that.

[01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:55.710]
I agree with that.

[01:33:55.710 --> 01:33:55.770]
I agree with that.

[01:33:55.770 --> 01:33:55.770]

[01:33:55.770 --> 01:33:55.770]

[01:33:55.770 --> 01:33:55.770]

[01:33:55.770 --> 01:33:59.250]
You're going to need to R&B charts and the Brooklyn charts and the Bronx charts.

[01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:01.550]
Even his dog attacked him.

[01:34:02.650 --> 01:34:03.050]
Right.

[01:34:03.870 --> 01:34:04.510]
You're going to need to hear that.

[01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:07.670]
Listen, I have one question for you since you're on the old East type of thing there.

[01:34:09.070 --> 01:34:11.670]
Remember the big bopper and end that kept killed in the playing crash?

[01:34:12.270 --> 01:34:13.950]
Richie Valens and...

[01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:15.750]
And Buddy Holly.

[01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:16.470]
Nobody Holly, right?

[01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:18.650]
What was the big bopper's real name?

[01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:20.650]
You know, the Bopper.

[01:34:20.650 --> 01:34:21.290]
God.

[01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:24.390]
Am I going to have to look this up or do you know it?

[01:34:24.530 --> 01:34:25.490]
I have no idea.

[01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:26.910]
I'm trying to find out.

[01:34:27.090 --> 01:34:29.270]
Somebody asked me and it's been driving me crazy.

[01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:31.170]
I know what they call them now.

[01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:32.050]
What?

[01:34:32.410 --> 01:34:32.550]
Dead.

[01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:35.070]
Perry Richardson.

[01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:37.790]
Perry with the P.P.

[01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:39.930]
Isn't like Luke Perry, like Randy Perry.

[01:34:40.650 --> 01:34:41.090]
Perry Richardson.

[01:34:41.630 --> 01:34:42.570]
All right, sounds good.

[01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:44.070]
You know, we call it whatever you want.

[01:34:44.150 --> 01:34:44.710]
Now he don't mind.

[01:34:45.090 --> 01:34:45.810]
I understand.

[01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.310]
Okay.

[01:34:47.090 --> 01:34:48.070]
And thanks so much.

[01:34:48.090 --> 01:34:48.550]
Have a great day.

[01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:49.650]
Hey, how's Buddy Holly?

[01:34:50.530 --> 01:34:56.430]
Yeah, the fact that they had that grotesque Gary Busy played Buddy Holly in that movie, he is the most annoying, the most disgusting.

[01:34:57.330 --> 01:35:01.370]
I get more visit violently, you'll see Gary Busy than everyone I see Gary Sarner.

[01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:03.130]
And that's in a lot.

[01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:05.810]
Here's a mobile in Miami Beach, hello.

[01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.950]
I'm here, Roger.

[01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.630]
Good day.

[01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:10.310]
I've been here for three years.

[01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:13.230]
Oh, this guy's talking to China in Dutch.

[01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:14.370]
I'm from Holland.

[01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.850]
How are you?

[01:35:15.090 --> 01:35:15.350]
All right.

[01:35:16.090 --> 01:35:17.090]
I'll speak to you.

[01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:18.710]
You still want to be German?

[01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:21.550]
How I got a piece of a wheel stuck in my throat, I think I'm going to be a German.

[01:35:21.650 --> 01:35:24.270]
You still want to know what you still want to know what I'll speak to you?

[01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:25.370]
Yes, what I'll speak to you.

[01:35:25.670 --> 01:35:27.570]
It means if it pleases you.

[01:35:28.210 --> 01:35:30.810]
If I like Prego, it's like a little bit like that.

[01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:32.070]
Yeah, they don't have that in English.

[01:35:33.250 --> 01:35:33.750]
They don't have the English.

[01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:36.630]
Anyway, I wanted to wish you a good 23 years.

[01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:37.670]
Good in shabas, yes.

[01:35:37.950 --> 01:35:38.570]
Good in shabas.

[01:35:38.770 --> 01:35:40.530]
I'm going to answer them in a couple weeks myself.

[01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:42.850]
Hopefully the better will be a little bit better.

[01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.530]
Great.

[01:35:43.530 --> 01:35:46.430]
And maybe they'll be on Queens Day.

[01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:47.830]
Say how'd all the Queens for me?

[01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:48.470]
Yes, they are.

[01:35:48.610 --> 01:35:49.390]
You remember that, eh?

[01:35:49.530 --> 01:35:49.890]
Yes, sir.

[01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:50.970]
That's the best day in Holland.

[01:35:51.070 --> 01:35:51.770]
You should go on here.

[01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.250]
Okay.

[01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:53.290]
Most follow the Amsterdam.

[01:35:53.670 --> 01:35:53.950]
All right.

[01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:55.810]
Anyway, Uncle Neil, keep them in the middle.

[01:35:56.090 --> 01:35:56.910]
I'll see you on the dam, Rick.

[01:35:57.090 --> 01:35:59.370]
Okay, I'll see you at McDonald's.

[01:35:59.530 --> 01:35:59.630]
Bye.

[01:35:59.910 --> 01:36:02.690]
By the way, you know the Dutch eat what they put on their fries, George?

[01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:05.510]
We have two open lines in the day one at Broward.

[01:36:05.630 --> 01:36:09.490]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60 and pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:36:11.170 --> 01:36:12.570]
Here's a mobile in North Miami Beach.

[01:36:12.570 --> 01:36:12.870]
Hello.

[01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:13.910]
Hey, how you doing, Neil?

[01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.270]
Great.

[01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:15.330]
Happy boredom.

[01:36:15.450 --> 01:36:16.870]
And back to you, is it still for them?

[01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:18.310]
I thought it was only a one-day deal.

[01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:19.250]
I don't know.

[01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:21.550]
I still haven't got around to making a home in touch, though.

[01:36:22.130 --> 01:36:26.530]
Hey, funny, I said it since you talked about music in your early days, like in the 70s.

[01:36:26.710 --> 01:36:27.670]
Did you ever spin music?

[01:36:28.150 --> 01:36:28.450]
Mm-hmm.

[01:36:28.690 --> 01:36:29.070]
Oh, you did?

[01:36:29.290 --> 01:36:30.030]
No, for years, yeah.

[01:36:30.370 --> 01:36:35.450]
So, I mean, aridsmiths, there's a lot better bands in aridsmiths, like from the 70s, like little feet.

[01:36:36.150 --> 01:36:36.650]
Oh, little.

[01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:39.370]
In the middle of my lunch, you're telling me little feet?

[01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:40.710]
In the middle of my lunch?

[01:36:41.970 --> 01:36:42.770]
Jamie, Christ.

[01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:44.250]
Lowel George was green.

[01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.790]
Little feet.

[01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:47.190]
You haven't been talking to Pete Bouldier, little feet.

[01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:54.010]
And if you're a fan subject, I mean, even jam bands, like, I know there's a new subject, like hip hop.

[01:36:54.450 --> 01:36:56.030]
There's something called jam bands.

[01:36:56.490 --> 01:36:57.710]
That, you know, that takes you to...

[01:36:58.250 --> 01:37:01.170]
Well, it's from the Grateful Dead era, you know, when they take one topic.

[01:37:01.170 --> 01:37:01.690]
Oh, yeah, the Grateful Dead.

[01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:03.530]
This guy's got little feet in the Grateful Dead.

[01:37:03.630 --> 01:37:04.950]
You really got it down to a science man.

[01:37:05.630 --> 01:37:06.830]
Yeah, but I mean...

[01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:08.550]
Can't wait till you're top 200 lists.

[01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:11.970]
If you could take, you know, a three minute song, it's turned into 30 minutes.

[01:37:12.210 --> 01:37:12.330]
Right.

[01:37:12.450 --> 01:37:13.730]
And keep people still dancing.

[01:37:14.170 --> 01:37:14.850]
That's pretty good.

[01:37:15.010 --> 01:37:15.170]
Yeah.

[01:37:15.670 --> 01:37:17.430]
You know, just keeping the stone like the Grateful Dead.

[01:37:17.730 --> 01:37:20.130]
Hell, I, well, you know, that's what it takes, you know.

[01:37:20.850 --> 01:37:25.310]
Well, no, but you're talking about fish, little feet, drink cheese, I mean it.

[01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.710]
Uh-huh.

[01:37:25.890 --> 01:37:26.790]
Great, great band.

[01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:27.730]
Arm pits, yeah.

[01:37:28.190 --> 01:37:28.490]
Yeah.

[01:37:28.630 --> 01:37:29.150]
Jayzu pits.

[01:37:29.630 --> 01:37:31.770]
Great, thanks for sharing your bad taste in the middle of my lunch.

[01:37:31.890 --> 01:37:32.170]
Thank you.

[01:37:32.610 --> 01:37:33.830]
God, little feet.

[01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:35.650]
Mmm.

[01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:39.930]
This is probably one of the guys that went over to Gulfstream to see the Old River Band.

[01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:45.490]
One of the six people that went over to there, see that's Stale Dead Act that wasn't good in the beginning.

[01:37:46.650 --> 01:37:51.010]
We have day lines open, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60 on a mobile one line.

[01:37:51.810 --> 01:37:54.990]
Like I said, two weeks at so, and the fact is, you know, a lot of you have very bad taste.

[01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:55.970]
And we can understand that.

[01:37:56.210 --> 01:37:56.690]
We sympathize.

[01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:57.190]
You live here.

[01:37:58.530 --> 01:37:59.510]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:37:59.570 --> 01:37:59.890]
Hello.

[01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:01.330]
Yes, sir?

[01:38:01.490 --> 01:38:04.090]
That 9.50 to 10 a.m. is killing me.

[01:38:04.090 --> 01:38:05.510]
D.F. was gotta go.

[01:38:06.330 --> 01:38:06.910]
Meaning what?

[01:38:08.110 --> 01:38:10.530]
That 1930s, vaudeville corn ball hits me.

[01:38:10.530 --> 01:38:11.770]
Okay, let's call him up and tell him.

[01:38:12.710 --> 01:38:14.370]
Here's a mobile in the tavernier.

[01:38:14.370 --> 01:38:14.650]
Hello.

[01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:15.590]
Nail, good afternoon.

[01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:16.170]
Yes, sir.

[01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:16.490]
Good evening.

[01:38:16.630 --> 01:38:17.110]
How you doing?

[01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:22.250]
Back in the 60s, I used to produce records and concerts and all that stuff.

[01:38:22.650 --> 01:38:23.830]
And there were a lot of good bands.

[01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:24.810]
It was all a matter of taste.

[01:38:25.490 --> 01:38:31.570]
But yesterday, when I heard him compare Aros and it to each boys, I mean, I liked George.

[01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.910]
I think he's great talent.

[01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:34.250]
He's missing a lot.

[01:38:34.250 --> 01:38:35.110]
You got crappy taste.

[01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:35.770]
We all love that.

[01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:36.830]
Oh, that's that blew it for me.

[01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:37.830]
I mean, it's terrible.

[01:38:38.050 --> 01:38:40.850]
I mean, anybody that's just for singing mushrooms, what does he know?

[01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:44.450]
The bottom line is there was a lot of groups.

[01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:46.690]
And I remember we produced a lot of records.

[01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:48.930]
There's a commercial record right now.

[01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:50.550]
It's the one group looking glass.

[01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:52.050]
They never did anything.

[01:38:52.150 --> 01:38:53.670]
I was in a studio where we made that.

[01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:55.190]
I was with the company that made it.

[01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:57.670]
And these guys sucked.

[01:38:58.010 --> 01:38:58.710]
Do you mean Brandy?

[01:38:58.970 --> 01:38:59.590]
Brandy, yeah.

[01:39:00.050 --> 01:39:01.090]
These guys, they were fun.

[01:39:01.090 --> 01:39:02.090]
That was a little bit of their smash.

[01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:03.390]
But that was it.

[01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:05.230]
They came up from electric play stadiums.

[01:39:05.230 --> 01:39:07.050]
They listened to that because we subsidized you.

[01:39:07.190 --> 01:39:08.210]
You got to produce this record.

[01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:09.650]
And these guys didn't want to do it.

[01:39:09.730 --> 01:39:10.790]
They're wanting to rock and roll bands.

[01:39:10.930 --> 01:39:11.430]
That was it.

[01:39:12.130 --> 01:39:12.550]
The one guy.

[01:39:13.330 --> 01:39:15.430]
I'd say right in there with Frankie Lyman and Teenagers.

[01:39:15.570 --> 01:39:16.790]
Oh, I'll tell you something.

[01:39:16.830 --> 01:39:17.530]
There was a lot of them.

[01:39:17.610 --> 01:39:20.890]
But the bottom line is when you talk about good and bad, it's a matter of taste.

[01:39:21.090 --> 01:39:25.930]
But I saw so many talented studio musicians, the fingers and stuff.

[01:39:26.110 --> 01:39:27.170]
They never got a break.

[01:39:27.450 --> 01:39:28.410]
It's just a matter of taste.

[01:39:28.690 --> 01:39:32.010]
There's some of the crap that there's a lot of people commenting on this.

[01:39:32.010 --> 01:39:34.550]
That have never even heard a lot of these people before.

[01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.870]

[01:39:35.570 --> 01:39:38.610]
And there was a lot of talent out there with the beach boys.

[01:39:39.190 --> 01:39:39.630]
Never.

[01:39:40.230 --> 01:39:40.570]
Never.

[01:39:41.650 --> 01:39:45.410]
On their best day, me personally, it made me puke.

[01:39:45.970 --> 01:39:46.170]
Really?

[01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:47.750]
Yeah, I mean, I just couldn't handle it.

[01:39:47.790 --> 01:39:48.650]
Now you're getting carried away.

[01:39:49.050 --> 01:39:51.330]
Well, I mean, I'm not.

[01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:52.570]
You're out of control, man.

[01:39:52.850 --> 01:39:53.030]
No.

[01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:53.730]
Over the edge.

[01:39:53.930 --> 01:39:54.470]
But Errol Smith.

[01:39:56.110 --> 01:39:56.550]
Yeah.

[01:39:56.610 --> 01:39:57.030]
Errol Smith.

[01:39:57.250 --> 01:39:58.990]
I mean, just like a belong jeopardy.

[01:39:59.050 --> 01:40:00.050]
They're doing something right.

[01:40:00.050 --> 01:40:01.750]
You mean you don't like this song?

[01:40:01.890 --> 01:40:02.690]
I can hear music.

[01:40:02.970 --> 01:40:04.230]
Well, the music's all right.

[01:40:04.410 --> 01:40:05.250]
I can listen to it.

[01:40:05.450 --> 01:40:05.810]
But I...

[01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:06.310]
What are you trying to say?

[01:40:06.810 --> 01:40:08.050]
That they hit a lot of sour notes.

[01:40:08.170 --> 01:40:08.990]
Is that what you're trying to say?

[01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:10.070]
They were all key most of the time.

[01:40:10.250 --> 01:40:10.410]
Exactly.

[01:40:10.410 --> 01:40:10.870]
And they're conscious.

[01:40:11.290 --> 01:40:12.930]
And that Brian Wilson was stoned out of his mind.

[01:40:13.290 --> 01:40:15.850]
And it was a couldn't the hit or right note if you held a gun to his head.

[01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:16.910]
Is that what you're trying to say?

[01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.790]
It was like the beach.

[01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:19.750]
It was like the Beatles having a...

[01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:20.350]
He was in a band.

[01:40:20.850 --> 01:40:25.790]
Wait till all these suckers go to the stones concerts tonight and discover that Mick Jagger has known a true note in 15 years.

[01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.690]
None of them have.

[01:40:27.250 --> 01:40:28.490]
He's got half his tongue missing.

[01:40:28.490 --> 01:40:28.870]
And they...

[01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:29.870]
These Tyler does.

[01:40:31.330 --> 01:40:32.050]
Well, the...

[01:40:32.050 --> 01:40:32.790]
The Weeknd and the Gel does.

[01:40:33.070 --> 01:40:35.710]
See, when you go to see a performer live, okay?

[01:40:36.050 --> 01:40:38.030]
You take all of that studio enhancement away.

[01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.190]
Right.

[01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:39.870]
And all the opportunities you do 100 years.

[01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:40.810]
They are guy-away.

[01:40:40.810 --> 01:40:42.150]
And you stick them right out there live.

[01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:43.950]
Then you find out if somebody can sing or not.

[01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:45.010]
They can't do it.

[01:40:45.170 --> 01:40:46.910]
There's a lot of very popular groups.

[01:40:46.930 --> 01:40:49.410]
And how come we left Helen Rady off this list too, by the way?

[01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:49.810]
Yeah.

[01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:53.130]
There's a lot of popular groups if they...

[01:40:53.130 --> 01:40:56.270]
They never perform live because they couldn't take it away.

[01:40:56.370 --> 01:40:57.810]
They couldn't do it without studio and hands.

[01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.990]
Right.

[01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:59.230]
That's bottom line.

[01:40:59.370 --> 01:40:59.730]
Right.

[01:41:00.010 --> 01:41:03.250]
How come we left the buddy Holly off the list?

[01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:04.010]
Well, yeah.

[01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.430]
He's good.

[01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:05.210]
He's pretty good.

[01:41:05.250 --> 01:41:06.070]
He was really good.

[01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:07.270]
I mean, he's not...

[01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.990]
He doesn't hurt his feelings.

[01:41:08.150 --> 01:41:11.610]
You got to remember, these guys were popular back in the days of Mono...

[01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:13.210]
Mono Mono, that's right.

[01:41:13.330 --> 01:41:13.510]
You know.

[01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:15.990]
Anyway, have a good day and...

[01:41:16.670 --> 01:41:16.770]
Okay.

[01:41:16.930 --> 01:41:17.790]
And I'll read it there to Roma.

[01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:18.130]
Okay.

[01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:19.010]
Death old fossil.

[01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.890]
What is it?

[01:41:21.090 --> 01:41:22.290]
He was a death old fossil.

[01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:23.210]
He's ripping the beach boys.

[01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:24.450]
I thought that that was really...

[01:41:24.450 --> 01:41:24.990]
I'm playing this.

[01:41:26.150 --> 01:41:26.790]
And he's ripping them.

[01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:29.830]
And Carl Wilson, I'm going to say, is going to come back from the dead just to show them a thing.

[01:41:31.170 --> 01:41:31.470]
God.

[01:41:32.230 --> 01:41:33.990]
How could anybody say these things?

[01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:34.390]

[01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:36.410]
He said, the fuck in your ass.

[01:41:37.450 --> 01:41:38.890]
He wasn't agreeing with everything I said.

[01:41:38.890 --> 01:41:40.150]
He said some ridiculous things.

[01:41:40.170 --> 01:41:40.790]
What the fuck?

[01:41:41.690 --> 01:41:43.930]
It's gonna be a man.

[01:41:45.110 --> 01:41:45.970]
There you go, Gully.

[01:41:46.130 --> 01:41:46.370]
Come on.

[01:41:46.510 --> 01:41:48.150]
We like the same things.

[01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.390]
Shmucks.

[01:41:50.010 --> 01:41:50.850]
You know, let's face it.

[01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:51.730]
A lot of you got bad taste.

[01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:52.130]
Okay?

[01:41:52.450 --> 01:41:53.570]
I've seen some of your wives.

[01:41:54.330 --> 01:41:54.690]
Okay.

[01:41:54.690 --> 01:41:56.090]
Let's go to a mobile in Miami.

[01:41:56.110 --> 01:41:56.470]
Hello.

[01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:58.930]
Mobile in Miami.

[01:41:59.470 --> 01:42:00.070]
Hey, Neil.

[01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:00.630]
Yes, sir.

[01:42:01.170 --> 01:42:02.930]
First time long time, young man.

[01:42:03.150 --> 01:42:03.430]
All right.

[01:42:03.870 --> 01:42:09.430]
I just want to give you a call and say I'm leaving a lovely city of Miami, born and raised, heading up to lovely North Carolina.

[01:42:09.930 --> 01:42:10.730]
And I'm going to miss you, kid.

[01:42:10.930 --> 01:42:11.490]
North Carolina?

[01:42:12.010 --> 01:42:12.910]
Yeah, North Carolina.

[01:42:13.110 --> 01:42:14.230]
I'm not going to have to either.

[01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:15.470]
Land of the Hicks.

[01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:17.690]
But I want to say...

[01:42:18.630 --> 01:42:20.150]
Hicks and Hicks, that's what George says.

[01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:22.150]
What do you say?

[01:42:23.010 --> 01:42:23.470]
What's that?

[01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:24.770]
That's what he says.

[01:42:24.930 --> 01:42:25.530]
That's what he says.

[01:42:25.610 --> 01:42:26.470]
Can I call it a douchebag?

[01:42:27.710 --> 01:42:29.270]
Can I call it a douchebag?

[01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:29.510]
Go ahead.

[01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:30.310]
First and last time.

[01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.650]
Yeah.

[01:42:30.930 --> 01:42:31.390]
Hey, Frankie.

[01:42:32.090 --> 01:42:34.550]
You are a hospital supply selling douchebag.

[01:42:34.650 --> 01:42:34.870]
Okay.

[01:42:35.290 --> 01:42:36.070]
Good luck, you pal.

[01:42:36.610 --> 01:42:37.430]
You'll need it big time.

[01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:39.450]
They don't like your kind up there.

[01:42:39.630 --> 01:42:41.990]
In fact, they don't like any kind up in North Carolina.

[01:42:42.730 --> 01:42:45.170]
When they find out that George is hanging out up there every now and then.

[01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.810]
What do you know?

[01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:47.570]
That's when the old...

[01:42:47.570 --> 01:42:48.550]
Is really going to hit the fans.

[01:42:48.730 --> 01:42:50.310]
I have them over for a rope out of your hell at the time.

[01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.310]

[01:42:50.450 --> 01:42:50.750]
Love it.

[01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:55.050]
By the way next time you're on the Rapa Queen say hi.

[01:42:55.530 --> 01:42:56.950]
Here's a mobile in west Palm Beach.

[01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:58.350]
Well, how are you doing?

[01:42:59.250 --> 01:43:00.910]
How about Floyd Mack?

[01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:05.310]
Oh, no.

[01:43:05.970 --> 01:43:05.970]

[01:43:08.730 --> 01:43:09.850]
People want John!

[01:43:09.930 --> 01:43:10.150]
Thenstä is on safe speaking.

[01:43:10.150 --> 01:43:11.890]
How about Floyd Mack or what?

[01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:15.610]
Like execution on TV on her wall.

[01:43:15.610 --> 01:43:16.590]
Hello there, nice to meet you.

[01:43:17.570 --> 01:43:18.430]
Good to meet you.

[01:43:19.930 --> 01:43:22.010]
Awesome Fleetwood Mac is awesome.

[01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:22.290]
Awesome.

[01:43:22.290 --> 01:43:23.710]
You're going to go with a straight face?

[01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.630]
Of course.

[01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.750]
Awful.

[01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:28.410]
And I'm a spick.

[01:43:28.670 --> 01:43:28.850]
Yeah.

[01:43:29.370 --> 01:43:30.350]
Well, that's the problem.

[01:43:30.630 --> 01:43:31.150]
No, okay.

[01:43:31.290 --> 01:43:32.910]
And I can only know from music.

[01:43:33.010 --> 01:43:34.250]
You're still singing La Cooca Racha.

[01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:37.330]
Carmen Miranda Desi Arne.

[01:43:37.570 --> 01:43:38.190]
Celia Cruz.

[01:43:38.490 --> 01:43:38.770]
Uh-huh.

[01:43:39.850 --> 01:43:41.990]
Hey, and I like Celine Dion, too, no doubt.

[01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:45.050]
Now, I am no way negative.

[01:43:45.390 --> 01:43:46.390]
Oh, now you're making a comeback.

[01:43:47.790 --> 01:43:50.110]
Hey, and I use a candy.

[01:43:50.410 --> 01:43:51.350]
I get it out of here.

[01:43:51.490 --> 01:43:52.250]
I mean, I'm into a lunch.

[01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:54.030]
Manage for french fries.

[01:43:54.190 --> 01:43:54.510]
Awesome.

[01:43:54.810 --> 01:43:55.010]
Yeah.

[01:43:55.190 --> 01:43:55.850]
That's a good deal.

[01:43:55.890 --> 01:43:57.710]
Say hi to John Revolter, while you're at it, get out of here.

[01:43:59.250 --> 01:44:01.030]
You know the Dutch put on your french fries?

[01:44:02.130 --> 01:44:03.770]
See, that's another thing talking about taste.

[01:44:03.890 --> 01:44:07.250]
If you thought that was a real movie, if you really thought that was an entertaining movie, again,

[01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:12.390]
Dr. Mark promises that we got the guy with a butterfly net is going to come in on Monday and help a lot of you folks on.

[01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:15.330]
Oh, but man, it's a call for you.

[01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:22.230]
All they got to do is put some kind of a label on it and right away a bunch of pseudo intellectual wannabes go, uh, you know, jump it on the bandwagon.

[01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:24.210]
Oh, yeah, it's a called classic.

[01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:26.850]
Yeah, like a refer madness.

[01:44:29.230 --> 01:44:30.250]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:30.610]
Hello.

[01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:32.070]
Yes, sir.

[01:44:32.410 --> 01:44:32.730]
Neil.

[01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.110]
Yes.

[01:44:33.110 --> 01:44:35.370]
Yeah, I love listening to your show, man.

[01:44:35.490 --> 01:44:36.370]
I haven't listened to it.

[01:44:36.450 --> 01:44:38.570]
I've, man since I was out of high school.

[01:44:38.770 --> 01:44:39.210]
Oh, right.

[01:44:39.630 --> 01:44:40.950]
You've got to high school.

[01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:43.170]
I don't know how to play.

[01:44:44.210 --> 01:44:45.090]
I'm going to go to the radio.

[01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:47.190]
It's a good distraction for what he'd be saying.

[01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:48.290]
All right.

[01:44:48.350 --> 01:44:50.270]
I'm not the agree with you on the fringy lineman thing.

[01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:51.270]
You're not pathetic.

[01:44:52.230 --> 01:44:53.470]
Man, I could like you.

[01:44:53.570 --> 01:44:57.390]
I could name a few groups that should be stepping on fringy lineman's head as far as top 10.

[01:44:57.430 --> 01:45:01.190]
And not only that, but you ask anybody today, like under the age of 100, who fringy lineman is,

[01:45:01.190 --> 01:45:04.190]
they'll tell you what, you know, but you ask them what the beach boys are,

[01:45:04.330 --> 01:45:06.290]
or the Beatles are these, you know, the arrow spots.

[01:45:06.330 --> 01:45:07.510]
I'll tell you right off the bat.

[01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:10.330]
My point is that you'll thumbs up as in rectum.

[01:45:11.670 --> 01:45:15.830]
And then guys talking about R&B is a lot of R&B groups that would fuck that shit.

[01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:17.450]
They should be there ahead of the alignment.

[01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:20.010]
You guys like you said, the four top 10 cases.

[01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:23.310]
You got a whole bunch of groups that should be on top of a fringy lineman.

[01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:24.470]
And R&B rock and everything else.

[01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:25.450]
I can't understand what you're saying.

[01:45:25.650 --> 01:45:26.430]
So if he said something.

[01:45:26.730 --> 01:45:27.890]
Okay, well, listen, have a great day.

[01:45:28.510 --> 01:45:29.810]
And call me when they let you out.

[01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:31.870]
He got out of high school.

[01:45:31.950 --> 01:45:32.170]
Let's go.

[01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:33.490]
We have an open line of day.

[01:45:33.610 --> 01:45:35.890]
What, and what are we going to do about the gorillas in our midst?

[01:45:36.650 --> 01:45:40.430]
Open line of day five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty in mobile one.

[01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:41.130]
That movie is coming up.

[01:45:41.170 --> 01:45:42.770]
By the way, they're filming it in Uganda right now.

[01:45:44.370 --> 01:45:45.550]
The gorillas in our midst.

[01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:48.290]
Here's a mobile in Lake Worth.

[01:45:48.370 --> 01:45:48.550]
Hello.

[01:45:49.370 --> 01:45:50.290]
Hey, Neil.

[01:45:50.350 --> 01:45:53.130]
Yes, I am speaking of gorillas.

[01:45:53.230 --> 01:45:53.770]
Welcome home.

[01:45:53.770 --> 01:45:54.870]
A really bad taste, sir.

[01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:55.990]
One thing about this audience.

[01:45:57.070 --> 01:45:57.850]
What about them?

[01:45:57.850 --> 01:45:59.090]
They, uh, they're audience.

[01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.970]
They're taste.

[01:46:00.090 --> 01:46:00.890]
Wow, go ahead.

[01:46:00.970 --> 01:46:01.390]
Hey, blow.

[01:46:02.210 --> 01:46:07.830]
Speaking about gorillas in the midst when I was in the army, we had a sergeant major who had the.

[01:46:08.670 --> 01:46:09.090]
He was here.

[01:46:09.170 --> 01:46:10.010]
We had a really bad son.

[01:46:10.150 --> 01:46:10.810]
Ten or mark.

[01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.130]
Yeah.

[01:46:11.550 --> 01:46:14.010]
And, uh, and a really bad speech impediment.

[01:46:14.530 --> 01:46:18.290]
And one day we were doing something and he stuck his, uh, we're supposed to be on guard.

[01:46:18.570 --> 01:46:21.590]
He stuck his one and he stuck his head in the tent and he goes.

[01:46:23.470 --> 01:46:25.150]
Who's supposed to be on God duty?

[01:46:25.150 --> 01:46:28.330]
So after that, his nickname was gorilla and met.

[01:46:28.690 --> 01:46:29.110]
So much.

[01:46:29.490 --> 01:46:29.750]
Yeah.

[01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:33.870]
But anyway, I don't know if anybody said this.

[01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:36.630]
He does a couple of covers, but that doesn't make him.

[01:46:36.750 --> 01:46:37.570]
We don't care about that.

[01:46:37.810 --> 01:46:41.290]
We don't care if you steal somebody else's material, especially if you like even do it better.

[01:46:42.150 --> 01:46:42.810]
Johnny Rivers.

[01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:43.910]
Allie Johnny Rivers.

[01:46:44.050 --> 01:46:46.270]
Not the top 10, but top 25 maybe.

[01:46:46.650 --> 01:46:50.870]
I just want to tap my toe and some other thing.

[01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:54.850]
And I guarantee you one thing a thousand times better than Frankie Lyman and the teenagers.

[01:46:55.210 --> 01:46:56.690]
Who the hell is Frankie Lyman?

[01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:57.150]
Exactly.

[01:46:58.650 --> 01:47:02.430]
I mean, I mean, I was born in 64 and, you know, cut the tentland of that baby.

[01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:06.590]
Let me just tell you that one thing, one we are sureing thing for you to know he's dead so we won't be making a comeback.

[01:47:07.090 --> 01:47:08.750]
Well, okay, that's not a problem.

[01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:09.550]
Never great day pal.

[01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:10.250]
Out here.

[01:47:10.630 --> 01:47:10.990]
Drugs.

[01:47:11.230 --> 01:47:11.570]
Drugs.

[01:47:11.650 --> 01:47:13.230]
Frankie Lyman, the teenagers and drugs.

[01:47:13.630 --> 01:47:13.990]
Yes, what?

[01:47:14.410 --> 01:47:14.510]
Dead.

[01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:16.190]
Huh?

[01:47:17.290 --> 01:47:19.370]
And beat that gator meat.

[01:47:20.730 --> 01:47:26.550]
Elton John returns to the studio to record the ultimate tribute album, Your Still Dead.

[01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:30.170]
Elton Singh's heartfelt tribute to the recent and long since death.

[01:47:30.650 --> 01:47:32.050]
You'll get the J. of K tribute.

[01:47:32.370 --> 01:47:34.110]
That's why they call it getting screwed.

[01:47:34.730 --> 01:47:38.670]
And to Johnny Versace, the inspiring pocketman.

[01:47:39.330 --> 01:47:41.490]
And of course, the stirring tribute to Mother Teresa.

[01:47:41.890 --> 01:47:43.810]
Don't let that nun go down on me.

[01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:47.150]
Available on CDN cassette on sale now.

[01:47:48.350 --> 01:47:50.410]
I thought it was the only your son go down on me.

[01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:51.690]
23 to one.

[01:47:51.930 --> 01:47:53.410]
By the way, how's Brendan doing today?

[01:47:53.850 --> 01:47:54.690]
We find Brendan yet.

[01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:55.090]
No.

[01:47:55.290 --> 01:47:56.210]
We have an open line today.

[01:47:56.430 --> 01:47:57.350]
We got Marlon's baseball.

[01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:58.550]
God, are we getting screwed today?

[01:47:58.710 --> 01:47:58.730]
Yeah.

[01:47:58.990 --> 01:47:59.870]
Are we getting a screw job?

[01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:00.710]
Yes.

[01:48:01.790 --> 01:48:02.610]
Marlon's in tab away.

[01:48:02.650 --> 01:48:06.010]
The pregame show starts at 1250 from what is it up there?

[01:48:06.130 --> 01:48:06.790]
What do they call that place?

[01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.910]
The era.

[01:48:10.130 --> 01:48:10.850]
The era.

[01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.030]

[01:48:11.490 --> 01:48:13.010]
I know we went through this last year too.

[01:48:13.010 --> 01:48:14.510]
We just is boring than it is now.

[01:48:15.570 --> 01:48:17.070]
Although, hey, we got Cliff Floyd.

[01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:17.670]
There you go.

[01:48:18.970 --> 01:48:20.170]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:48:20.170 --> 01:48:20.530]
Hello.

[01:48:21.250 --> 01:48:21.610]
Dale.

[01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:22.210]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:22.610 --> 01:48:24.430]
Got a baseball seasoning in our area.

[01:48:24.590 --> 01:48:25.110]
Isn't this pathetic?

[01:48:25.630 --> 01:48:26.830]
Maybe the fifth of March.

[01:48:26.930 --> 01:48:27.050]
Maybe the fifth of March.

[01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:30.050]
It's the fifth of March and we got a goddamn baseball game in the middle of the day here.

[01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:33.750]
Maybe they'll do us a favor and go on strike like the NBA did for a little while.

[01:48:33.930 --> 01:48:34.410]
All right.

[01:48:34.810 --> 01:48:35.530]
Excellent idea.

[01:48:37.770 --> 01:48:40.150]
Anyway, they tried that, but you know, not too long ago.

[01:48:40.230 --> 01:48:40.790]
It didn't work too good.

[01:48:41.950 --> 01:48:45.670]
The best live show I ever saw in my opinion was Boston.

[01:48:46.650 --> 01:48:48.470]
Right down here at the Coral Sky Ampitheater.

[01:48:48.610 --> 01:48:48.810]
Yeah.

[01:48:49.570 --> 01:48:50.290]
They're okay.

[01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:52.670]
They do it right when they play live.

[01:48:52.970 --> 01:48:55.550]
They have three to guitar stuff.

[01:48:55.810 --> 01:48:57.810]
They have a Brad Delp, a beautiful voice.

[01:48:59.170 --> 01:49:00.510]
And I love them.

[01:49:00.610 --> 01:49:02.450]
And they were true to it.

[01:49:02.590 --> 01:49:03.870]
I mean, it sounds just like a...

[01:49:03.870 --> 01:49:04.610]
Two to their school idea.

[01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:05.530]
Yeah.

[01:49:05.850 --> 01:49:07.410]
I mean, no sour notes.

[01:49:08.370 --> 01:49:09.370]
It's got a great show.

[01:49:09.370 --> 01:49:10.310]
And they're actually...

[01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:12.730]
There are going to be a lot of people going to go to that stones concert tonight.

[01:49:12.850 --> 01:49:15.330]
I guarantee on Monday we'll get some calls and say, oh, you're wrong, boy.

[01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:16.290]
They were just fantastic.

[01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:17.570]
See, it's one thing to say.

[01:49:17.610 --> 01:49:20.850]
Somebody was fantastic because they jumped around a lot and they had a lot of energy.

[01:49:21.150 --> 01:49:23.290]
And they showed that they were still alive and they could barely breathe.

[01:49:23.570 --> 01:49:25.370]
And they didn't poop their pants more than once or twice.

[01:49:25.630 --> 01:49:26.130]
You're in a concert.

[01:49:26.610 --> 01:49:28.090]
So everybody else said, oh, that was great.

[01:49:28.290 --> 01:49:31.950]
But in terms of really being able to sing and be true to the music.

[01:49:32.450 --> 01:49:34.770]
I mean, anybody can tell me what they're going to see tonight.

[01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:36.450]
I'll be shocked if I hear that.

[01:49:36.810 --> 01:49:37.090]
Yeah.

[01:49:37.090 --> 01:49:38.630]
I saw them when they were down here.

[01:49:38.690 --> 01:49:40.870]
I think it was in 84 when they played in Joe Robby.

[01:49:41.010 --> 01:49:42.850]
And everyone thought that was going to be their last tour.

[01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:43.190]
Yeah.

[01:49:43.330 --> 01:49:44.670]
And that was a great show.

[01:49:44.890 --> 01:49:46.090]
Later and they're still coming in.

[01:49:46.210 --> 01:49:46.210]

[01:49:46.230 --> 01:49:48.630]
Now they have their social security tour going on.

[01:49:48.930 --> 01:49:49.070]
Yeah.

[01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:50.630]
Yeah, I don't know.

[01:49:50.850 --> 01:49:55.750]
I wouldn't pay a ticket to see them anymore, but, you know, everybody's got their own taste.

[01:49:56.250 --> 01:49:56.570]
Exactly.

[01:49:57.810 --> 01:49:58.130]
But...

[01:49:58.130 --> 01:49:58.790]
Okay, I'll see you in the bottom.

[01:49:58.830 --> 01:49:59.390]
I have a material.

[01:49:59.530 --> 01:50:00.210]
Okay, leave it there.

[01:50:00.650 --> 01:50:01.410]
Are we the durch?

[01:50:01.670 --> 01:50:02.670]
We have an open-line at day.

[01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:04.630]
By the way, this is a great lunch today from SNOTE.

[01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:06.510]
I mean, real Italian.

[01:50:09.090 --> 01:50:10.770]
Not like, you know, spaghetti and sausage.

[01:50:10.970 --> 01:50:13.590]
I mean, I do love spaghetti and sausage, but if I want spaghetti and sausage,

[01:50:13.770 --> 01:50:14.550]
we'll call up pizza a lot.

[01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:15.110]
They'll bring us in.

[01:50:15.150 --> 01:50:15.670]
That's very good.

[01:50:15.970 --> 01:50:17.230]
But it's like the music.

[01:50:17.450 --> 01:50:18.290]
It's a different genre.

[01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.230]
Right?

[01:50:20.150 --> 01:50:21.050]
This is upscale.

[01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:22.290]
This is like authentic.

[01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:24.070]
This is like you'd really get in a fine.

[01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:25.010]
Not in a trot-terrier.

[01:50:25.330 --> 01:50:26.170]
But like, well, let me...

[01:50:26.170 --> 01:50:29.390]
I guess in some of the trot-terriers, which, by the way, when you go to Italy and many of you will,

[01:50:30.530 --> 01:50:31.930]
that's one of the pieces of good news.

[01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:36.670]
Don't worry about fancy, elegant, very, very super expensive Italian restaurants.

[01:50:37.170 --> 01:50:38.470]
Go to your mom and pop trot-terriers.

[01:50:38.890 --> 01:50:41.370]
95% of them are just spectacular.

[01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:43.150]
And the menus are very simple.

[01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:46.410]
They don't have a big complicated menu, but everything on it is fresh.

[01:50:46.590 --> 01:50:47.050]
It's delicious.

[01:50:47.450 --> 01:50:51.710]
Oh, the spaghetti pommadoro that I eat at one restaurant that we go to all the time in Italy.

[01:50:52.070 --> 01:50:52.250]
And Rome.

[01:50:52.570 --> 01:50:53.430]
Oh my God.

[01:50:53.810 --> 01:50:54.570]
I don't know what it is.

[01:50:54.810 --> 01:50:58.310]
It's the first of all, the tomatoes, all the produce in Italy and that part of the world

[01:50:58.310 --> 01:51:01.710]
is a million times better than you could ever buy here because of the soil.

[01:51:02.810 --> 01:51:06.230]
As opposed to trying to grow produce in sand like they do here in Florida.

[01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:17.490]
And whatever they, of course, they put their pommajano in the sauce and they mix it with the pasta.

[01:51:18.510 --> 01:51:21.390]
I mean, there are a lot of places where you go in and they do great, the cheese fresh on top.

[01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:22.070]
They don't do that.

[01:51:22.370 --> 01:51:24.710]
They put it right in the sauce and mix it all together.

[01:51:25.570 --> 01:51:26.170]
Mamma mia.

[01:51:28.670 --> 01:51:29.770]
Here's a Fort Lauderdale.

[01:51:29.890 --> 01:51:29.930]
Hello.

[01:51:30.530 --> 01:51:31.330]
Neil, how you doing?

[01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:31.730]
Great.

[01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:36.470]
Neil, we're just one of the groups that sings.

[01:51:37.530 --> 01:51:40.890]
I think one of the best is crossbeast children grandmothers.

[01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.870]
They can sing.

[01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.730]
Yeah.

[01:51:44.330 --> 01:51:46.490]
Yeah, if they'd ever give him a new liver, he might be okay.

[01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:49.090]
Well, I think he did get the chance.

[01:51:49.210 --> 01:51:50.090]
He got a new liver.

[01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.710]
Also, this is the thing.

[01:51:51.710 --> 01:51:54.890]
Everyone at Walter Payton could have used and God damn David Crossbe got it.

[01:51:55.630 --> 01:51:59.450]
Now, see, that pisses me off because David Crossbeast screwed up his liver with all the booze and drugs

[01:51:59.450 --> 01:52:01.590]
and Walter Payton just had some kind of disease.

[01:52:02.150 --> 01:52:05.410]
I say, let's take David Crossbeast liver and give it to Walter Payton.

[01:52:05.530 --> 01:52:06.190]
There you go.

[01:52:06.670 --> 01:52:08.270]
That's our poll question for Monday.

[01:52:09.330 --> 01:52:09.770]
Right?

[01:52:10.290 --> 01:52:10.590]
Yeah.

[01:52:11.130 --> 01:52:11.250]
Yeah.

[01:52:11.550 --> 01:52:14.610]
There's also a tape floating around a monocost thing.

[01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.470]
Yeah.

[01:52:15.810 --> 01:52:16.970]
Have you heard about that?

[01:52:20.670 --> 01:52:21.030]
Yeah.

[01:52:25.730 --> 01:52:26.210]
That's it.

[01:52:26.810 --> 01:52:28.110]
Here's a mobile in Halea.

[01:52:28.170 --> 01:52:28.370]
Hello.

[01:52:28.990 --> 01:52:29.670]
Neil, God.

[01:52:29.950 --> 01:52:30.430]
Yes, sir.

[01:52:30.890 --> 01:52:31.570]
You're getting me hungry.

[01:52:32.070 --> 01:52:32.810]
That's good stuff.

[01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:34.270]
Hey, listen about George.

[01:52:34.990 --> 01:52:37.490]
When he first came on the air for you about what was it two months ago?

[01:52:38.010 --> 01:52:39.070]
Didn't really care for him much.

[01:52:39.090 --> 01:52:39.830]
I could take it a little bit.

[01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:41.090]
But last week, he was awesome.

[01:52:41.290 --> 01:52:42.310]
He's getting good, man.

[01:52:42.630 --> 01:52:43.090]
He's getting good.

[01:52:43.090 --> 01:52:43.610]
Oh, he was.

[01:52:43.710 --> 01:52:44.970]
I don't.

[01:52:44.970 --> 01:52:47.610]
I don't think it was those guys anymore insecure in the morning than they already are.

[01:52:48.530 --> 01:52:49.730]
But I heard a rumor in the hall.

[01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:54.770]
It wasn't even in the, just off the elevator this morning, I heard them talking in the other elevator on the shaft.

[01:52:55.290 --> 01:52:56.450]
It's because somebody getting the shaft.

[01:52:56.850 --> 01:53:01.510]
But they're thinking because it would make a lot of sense, you know, George in the morning, in the end of the day back to back, keep the quality going.

[01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:02.330]
I'd buy that.

[01:53:02.670 --> 01:53:02.970]
Hell yeah.

[01:53:03.130 --> 01:53:06.350]
Yeah, instead of talking all the time, I'm talking all those illiterate dumb jokes, you know.

[01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:10.270]
Yeah, I know you're using a towel mix, but this dogs were pretty cutting edge, so it was pretty cool.

[01:53:10.350 --> 01:53:11.630]
I thought my stuff actually turned in.

[01:53:11.950 --> 01:53:12.190]
Excellent.

[01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:14.930]
Anyway, hey, talking about, uh,

[01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:16.110]
that's why we're doing so.

[01:53:16.250 --> 01:53:16.250]

[01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:18.810]
That's one of the other reasons why they were doing so well, by the way.

[01:53:19.050 --> 01:53:20.130]
No more of those stupid tapes.

[01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:24.470]
And congratulations Neil, that I came up with this idea, getting rid of the tapes and putting George on.

[01:53:24.670 --> 01:53:26.750]
Now when I go on vacation, we don't go down a point.

[01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:29.470]
Instead, we're just continuing moving along and we continue to momentum.

[01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:30.410]
And we're building.

[01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:31.570]
We're going up like a point.

[01:53:31.710 --> 01:53:31.870]
Thanks, man.

[01:53:32.070 --> 01:53:34.030]
Because George is doing a 30 share while he's on there.

[01:53:34.250 --> 01:53:34.910]
Anybody believe that?

[01:53:35.110 --> 01:53:36.050]
No, he don't believe it either.

[01:53:36.230 --> 01:53:36.690]
No more tape.

[01:53:37.250 --> 01:53:39.650]
Hey, uh, if you're talking about top 10 bands, that would have walked in.

[01:53:39.650 --> 01:53:39.810]
I'm not going to walk in.

[01:53:39.810 --> 01:53:40.690]
He's doing a 20.

[01:53:41.890 --> 01:53:44.330]
You're talking about top 10, the 70s.

[01:53:44.330 --> 01:53:46.730]
I can't believe no one's mentioned Rush or I think Floyd.

[01:53:48.730 --> 01:53:49.130]
Hello?

[01:53:49.410 --> 01:53:50.330]
Yeah, I'm still here.

[01:53:50.710 --> 01:53:50.810]
Yeah.

[01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:52.510]
Yeah, they're okay.

[01:53:52.810 --> 01:53:54.310]
Rush is a great live band.

[01:53:54.570 --> 01:53:57.130]
One thing I like about Rush is that it's only those three on stage.

[01:53:57.130 --> 01:53:58.890]
They don't have all the backup singers and all that.

[01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.650]
How about REM?

[01:54:00.710 --> 01:54:01.430]
Yeah, they're pretty good.

[01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:03.030]
They're a good time for them live in that lab.

[01:54:03.810 --> 01:54:09.150]
But there's a difference between pretty good and being one of the 10 best recording artists or groups of all time.

[01:54:09.590 --> 01:54:09.850]
Big difference.

[01:54:09.850 --> 01:54:11.510]
I mean, that's a very select category.

[01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:15.610]
And you certainly wouldn't put pink Floyd in that group or Rush.

[01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:16.550]
Well, sure.

[01:54:16.650 --> 01:54:18.830]
I mean, I'm talking to someone that, you know, 70s rock.

[01:54:18.910 --> 01:54:19.850]
No, Rush, but pink Floyd.

[01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:21.790]
You put pink Floyd one of the top 10?

[01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:22.150]
Sure.

[01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.530]
No.

[01:54:23.190 --> 01:54:23.490]
No.

[01:54:23.730 --> 01:54:24.850]
No way.

[01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:26.150]
You know, Rush and pink Floyd, they're talking about the joy.

[01:54:26.150 --> 01:54:26.850]
Better than the joy?

[01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.710]
No.

[01:54:27.990 --> 01:54:28.130]
Oh.

[01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:30.390]
Better than Air Ocemouth?

[01:54:30.810 --> 01:54:30.950]
Yes.

[01:54:31.390 --> 01:54:31.750]
Oh!

[01:54:32.410 --> 01:54:34.410]
Oh, I'm just having a health of a great lunch.

[01:54:36.190 --> 01:54:41.030]
I've just finished a great lunch in this man just because he wants to see me puke right here on here, which I've never done before.

[01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:43.190]
He did, he said it with a straight face.

[01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:45.350]
Can you believe that?

[01:54:45.890 --> 01:54:46.270]
Unbelievable.

[01:54:46.730 --> 01:54:47.650]
Okay, have a great day, pal.

[01:54:47.950 --> 01:54:48.210]
Do it.

[01:54:48.730 --> 01:54:51.410]
You've destroyed my faith in the subhuman race.

[01:54:52.190 --> 01:54:54.030]
You've destroyed my faith in Cubans.

[01:54:57.010 --> 01:54:57.490]
Yeah.

[01:54:59.810 --> 01:55:03.330]
Oh, didn't take much, but here's a mobile in Orlando.

[01:55:03.330 --> 01:55:03.790]
Hello.

[01:55:04.350 --> 01:55:04.830]
Neil.

[01:55:05.110 --> 01:55:05.470]
Yes, sir.

[01:55:05.790 --> 01:55:06.410]
Here's one.

[01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:07.150]
How many Joe?

[01:55:07.470 --> 01:55:07.630]
Hey.

[01:55:08.210 --> 01:55:09.790]
Here's one that you definitely forgot about.

[01:55:09.790 --> 01:55:11.070]
What about Queen?

[01:55:12.630 --> 01:55:13.550]
What about Queen?

[01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:14.150]
Queen.

[01:55:14.290 --> 01:55:15.530]
I'd say the top 60, maybe.

[01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:16.770]
Oh, come on, Neil.

[01:55:17.150 --> 01:55:17.550]
Not into Queen.

[01:55:17.550 --> 01:55:18.610]
I know, I had a Freddie Mercury with him.

[01:55:18.610 --> 01:55:19.130]
I know he's late.

[01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:21.210]
He was playing with all the hell, but he was pretty damn rich on stage.

[01:55:21.370 --> 01:55:21.510]
Yeah.

[01:55:21.810 --> 01:55:22.650]
He was just great.

[01:55:23.190 --> 01:55:24.630]
And nobody mentioned Billy Joel either.

[01:55:24.890 --> 01:55:25.150]
Good.

[01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.690]
Yeah, they did.

[01:55:25.810 --> 01:55:26.650]
That was great.

[01:55:26.850 --> 01:55:29.050]
But somebody said Billy Joel, then we all together.

[01:55:29.590 --> 01:55:30.030]
He's scary.

[01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:30.690]
In unison.

[01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:31.550]
We all puke together.

[01:55:32.250 --> 01:55:32.930]
Billy Joel.

[01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.430]
Boy.

[01:55:34.350 --> 01:55:37.870]
Not only a bad performer, but an irritating person too.

[01:55:37.870 --> 01:55:38.590]
A annoying.

[01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.710]
Grating.

[01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:40.850]
A annoying his hell.

[01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:43.710]
But you keep on trying, folks.

[01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:45.210]
We'll come up with a good one here sooner or later.

[01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:46.750]
Like the churrells.

[01:55:46.970 --> 01:55:51.410]
I mean, the churrells aren't top 10 material, but certainly better than Frankie Lyman and the teenagers.

[01:55:51.810 --> 01:55:53.010]
Does anybody dispute that?

[01:55:53.150 --> 01:55:53.410]
No.

[01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:54.290]
No, of course not.

[01:55:55.630 --> 01:56:04.270]
Even the Ron Nets, that Phil Spectigroup, the Ron Nets, all those groups, would certainly be far superior than Frankie Lyman and the teenagers.

[01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:09.090]
That's where the guy, I could have handled his list even the Elvis thing, which is silly.

[01:56:10.110 --> 01:56:15.370]
It's ridiculous to put Elvis Presley in a Sam Category with all these other great groups that people are mentioning here.

[01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:19.390]
But I could even handle that just based on the hype of the whole deal.

[01:56:20.710 --> 01:56:23.590]
But once you stuck Frankie Lyman in there, that was it.

[01:56:23.670 --> 01:56:25.590]
That's when we went to a parting of the ways.

[01:56:27.130 --> 01:56:27.910]
Here's Miami B.

[01:56:28.030 --> 01:56:28.230]
Chilla.

[01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:30.490]
Yes, sir.

[01:56:30.630 --> 01:56:30.930]
Hey, Neil.

[01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:33.330]
Uh, nobody mentioned what's up in here?

[01:56:33.330 --> 01:56:35.290]
Yeah, somebody mentioned that the other day.

[01:56:36.150 --> 01:56:38.190]
There's a group up there and all the way.

[01:56:38.450 --> 01:56:39.110]
Maybe number one.

[01:56:39.250 --> 01:56:40.070]
Top 30, I'd say.

[01:56:40.350 --> 01:56:42.630]
Uh, nothing about Frankie Lyman.

[01:56:43.710 --> 01:56:44.710]
He didn't write that.

[01:56:44.970 --> 01:56:48.310]
Well, he co-wrote that song when Fools Fall in Love.

[01:56:48.430 --> 01:56:49.170]
Why the Fools Fall in Love?

[01:56:49.410 --> 01:56:50.630]
Yeah, he didn't write it himself.

[01:56:50.930 --> 01:56:53.050]
One of the other teenagers wrote it with him.

[01:56:53.170 --> 01:56:53.310]
Yeah.

[01:56:53.650 --> 01:56:55.390]
And he took the credit for it.

[01:56:55.650 --> 01:56:56.770]
And that's why the group broke up.

[01:56:57.150 --> 01:56:57.370]
Really?

[01:56:57.710 --> 01:56:57.850]
Yeah.

[01:56:58.350 --> 01:57:01.250]
Well, I guess he got his.

[01:57:01.250 --> 01:57:04.610]
Well, what happened was that the manager of the group

[01:57:04.610 --> 01:57:08.690]
put his name on it and it was on the little, uh, little record.

[01:57:08.970 --> 01:57:12.650]
And instead of saying Frank DeLiaman and the teenage sister, Frankie Lyman,

[01:57:12.650 --> 01:57:13.690]
and that was the end of the group.

[01:57:14.050 --> 01:57:14.450]
Nice.

[01:57:14.690 --> 01:57:16.830]
And then he got to heroin and then overdosing died.

[01:57:16.990 --> 01:57:17.390]
There you go.

[01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:19.190]
I said that ego would get to every time, man.

[01:57:19.410 --> 01:57:21.610]
And anybody could try to talk about the Steve Kanger's,

[01:57:21.630 --> 01:57:22.490]
or go look where he is now.

[01:57:23.070 --> 01:57:26.650]
And anybody who thinks the beach boys are better than Aros Smith or any other group

[01:57:26.650 --> 01:57:28.250]
got to go get their head checked.

[01:57:28.630 --> 01:57:28.910]
Okay.

[01:57:29.190 --> 01:57:30.070]
George, you're an idiot.

[01:57:30.070 --> 01:57:30.530]
Okay.

[01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:31.870]
George, thank you so much.

[01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.870]
Up here is Twins.

[01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:35.390]
I go out to the beach.

[01:57:35.950 --> 01:57:36.310]
Amen.

[01:57:38.110 --> 01:57:38.570]
Come down.

[01:57:40.130 --> 01:57:40.490]
Yeah.

[01:57:40.710 --> 01:57:41.870]
I do love the beach boys.

[01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:43.770]
And I had the music I was driving to the track last night.

[01:57:43.870 --> 01:57:46.050]
I was listening to beach boys and Aros Smith like, alternately.

[01:57:46.630 --> 01:57:49.650]
And I can't pick and choose because they're by love them both so much.

[01:57:49.870 --> 01:57:50.870]
But they were better.

[01:57:50.890 --> 01:57:50.890]

[01:57:51.050 --> 01:57:51.630]
Totally different.

[01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:55.410]
But in terms of, for example, if you're going to include as part of the criteria,

[01:57:56.930 --> 01:57:59.930]
performing, I mean, first of all, Brian Wilson, after he had the nervous

[01:57:59.930 --> 01:58:01.830]
breakdown, he was in bed most of the right of his life.

[01:58:02.170 --> 01:58:04.030]
He never went out on concert after that anyway.

[01:58:04.030 --> 01:58:06.210]
In fact, who was the name of the other kid?

[01:58:06.530 --> 01:58:07.390]
Well, what am I asking you?

[01:58:08.050 --> 01:58:08.630]
The fifth beat.

[01:58:08.970 --> 01:58:12.290]
Well, there actually were six because David Marx was before Al Jardin,

[01:58:12.490 --> 01:58:13.050]
he replaced him.

[01:58:13.310 --> 01:58:16.990]
But there was another beach boy who was really bad, by the way.

[01:58:17.490 --> 01:58:18.270]
What the hell was his name?

[01:58:18.570 --> 01:58:19.290]
It's in here somewhere.

[01:58:20.490 --> 01:58:21.650]
We used to go on tour.

[01:58:21.770 --> 01:58:24.090]
I don't have time to read the whole goddamn liner notes in this thing.

[01:58:24.510 --> 01:58:25.530]
What the hell was his name, George?

[01:58:25.650 --> 01:58:26.310]
Come on real quick.

[01:58:31.210 --> 01:58:32.250]
Can't find it.

[01:58:33.030 --> 01:58:36.990]
But I mean, is a performing group, the beach boys would have to, you know,

[01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:38.190]
now you wouldn't have met that.

[01:58:38.590 --> 01:58:39.690]
Eros Smith's far better.

[01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:41.090]
Oh, no question.

[01:58:41.470 --> 01:58:42.270]
Oh, thank God.

[01:58:42.450 --> 01:58:43.090]
They put on a show.

[01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:43.750]
Right.

[01:58:45.790 --> 01:58:46.830]
Because he can sing.

[01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:48.050]
Here's Kendall.

[01:58:48.050 --> 01:58:48.430]
Hello.

[01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:49.270]
Neil.

[01:58:49.550 --> 01:58:49.850]
Yes, sir.

[01:58:49.970 --> 01:58:50.510]
What about yes?

[01:58:51.570 --> 01:58:52.050]
No.

[01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:52.850]
No.

[01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.830]
Okay.

[01:58:54.070 --> 01:58:54.970]
What about sticks?

[01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.710]
No.

[01:58:56.110 --> 01:58:56.430]
No.

[01:58:56.770 --> 01:58:56.950]
No.

[01:58:57.010 --> 01:58:57.830]
You got to be kidding me.

[01:58:57.870 --> 01:58:58.010]
No.

[01:58:58.590 --> 01:59:01.070]
Well, I'm a big rush fan and, uh...

[01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:01.910]
Well, he's on right now.

[01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:02.710]
He's on that.

[01:59:03.050 --> 01:59:04.770]
Oh, no, not that big rush fan.

[01:59:05.670 --> 01:59:05.790]
Okay.

[01:59:05.970 --> 01:59:06.530]
What about Genesis?

[01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.510]
No.

[01:59:07.610 --> 01:59:07.870]
Collins?

[01:59:08.050 --> 01:59:08.690]
No, you don't like him?

[01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:09.470]
Oh, Phil Collins.

[01:59:09.670 --> 01:59:11.050]
I get, I get, uh, physically.

[01:59:11.370 --> 01:59:13.290]
In fact, I think my rash came from Phil Collins.

[01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:14.990]
I mean, it was, no, it was the delayed reaction.

[01:59:15.130 --> 01:59:16.470]
I was playing Phil Collins on Zeta.

[01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:17.010]
Yeah.

[01:59:17.010 --> 01:59:18.030]
You were like 15 years ago.

[01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:19.310]
I think the rash just set in.

[01:59:19.890 --> 01:59:20.890]
Fantastic performance, though.

[01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:21.830]
Okay.

[01:59:21.970 --> 01:59:22.970]
What about the police?

[01:59:23.590 --> 01:59:24.350]
Oh, I love the police.

[01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:25.690]
Great, great fan.

[01:59:25.710 --> 01:59:26.790]
Sure, no, no, no.

[01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:31.030]
I wouldn't say top 10, but to stop and compare the police

[01:59:31.590 --> 01:59:34.970]
with Frankie Lyman and the teenagers, I mean, it's ridiculous.

[01:59:35.370 --> 01:59:35.770]
It's laughable.

[01:59:36.010 --> 01:59:38.350]
Anybody that would put the, you know, or the supreme's.

[01:59:38.910 --> 01:59:39.850]
The police are in danger.

[01:59:40.210 --> 01:59:40.210]

[01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.390]

[01:59:40.490 --> 01:59:42.250]
Different time period, all the other.

[01:59:42.450 --> 01:59:42.990]
Sure, certainly.

[01:59:43.630 --> 01:59:44.810]
Uh, well, okay.

[01:59:45.370 --> 01:59:47.670]
I mean, if you're actually Lyman and the teenagers, they stink.

[01:59:48.410 --> 01:59:49.850]
Did you ever see Pink Floyd live, you know?

[01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:50.150]
No.

[01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:51.450]
Incredible.

[01:59:51.770 --> 01:59:51.930]
Yeah.

[01:59:51.930 --> 01:59:53.510]
R.E.M. Live and credit.

[01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:54.430]
I love R.E.M.

[01:59:55.090 --> 01:59:55.730]
Fantastic bands.

[01:59:56.050 --> 01:59:56.050]

[01:59:56.590 --> 01:59:58.150]
And I got to touch the sticks again.

[01:59:58.290 --> 02:00:00.910]
They were definitely one of the best bands I was growing up.

[02:00:00.930 --> 02:00:01.270]
Much away.

[02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.950]
Have a great day, Pat.

[02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.230]
You too.

[02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:04.770]
He's touching sticks or something that rhymes with sticks.

[02:00:05.170 --> 02:00:05.370]
Okay.

[02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:06.550]
Listen, that's going to do it for us.

[02:00:06.590 --> 02:00:07.190]
Can you believe that?

[02:00:07.470 --> 02:00:08.010]
Can you believe that?

[02:00:08.010 --> 02:00:08.050]
No.

[02:00:08.150 --> 02:00:11.950]
We get screwed just when we're picking up some momentum and talking about some real heavy-do-these stuff here today.

[02:00:12.670 --> 02:00:14.310]
And you want to know why we got to get out of here?

[02:00:14.450 --> 02:00:17.270]
Because we got an exhibition baseball game coming up, baby.

[02:00:17.590 --> 02:00:18.030]
That's right.

[02:00:18.510 --> 02:00:20.250]
Marlins and Tampa Bay at Viera.

[02:00:20.430 --> 02:00:23.630]
Viera, what kind of hell are the damn places up there with Joe Angel and Dave O'Brien?

[02:00:23.810 --> 02:00:24.850]
You get on the edge of your seats.

[02:00:25.670 --> 02:00:27.170]
The Deal Roger Show.
