[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.900]
560 W2AM Miami-Bort Lauderdale presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.980]
We talked to Neil called 560 W2AM,

[00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.880]
he's being told free for date and rarer,

[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.240]
he's known 560 on your cell phone.

[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.180]
The opinions of Neil and his guests,

[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.960]
are anyone else on the show

[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.760]
that does not necessarily reflect those

[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.800]
of the GQAM,

[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.660]
because he made acquisition for the

[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.000]
easily-used guest hotel.

[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.780]
Now, Neil Rogers,

[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.160]
on Sports Radio 560 QAL,

[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.200]
the following will be the case,

[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.380]
I'm ex-reduced, I'm the international

[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.980]
legal procedure.

[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.900]
Let's face,

[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.720]
most of us will never be rich.

[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.920]
Hell, we probably won't even be successful,

[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.280]
and that's pretty damn depressing.

[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.980]
But, as usual, with every problem,

[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.660]
there is a solution.

[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.160]
Hi, I'm Jim, and I'm here to tell you

[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.420]
a little something about hand guns.

[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.700]
They scare the s**t out of people,

[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.160]
intimidate them and they're giving you

[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.980]
whatever you want.

[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.800]
That's right, hand guns.

[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.860]
Think about it.

[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.880]
Need some cash?

[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.860]
Probably bank.

[00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.440]
Don't have enough money for beer?

[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.480]
Call it the convenience.

[00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.200]
Take chips and pretzels while you're at it.

[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.100]
It's all free if you've got a hand gun.

[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.420]
Some son of a bitch cheating on your girlfriend?

[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.260]
Kill him.

[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.480]
The simple solution to life's complex prowls.

[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.400]
All I have to do is wait the five days for it,

[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.160]
and happiness is just around the corner.

[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.320]
Hell, if you don't want to wait the five days,

[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.800]
who cares?

[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.540]
Find a dancing off the street.

[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.280]
Just buy a lot of hand guns.

[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.580]
It's a great alternative.

[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.640]
The working problem's out.

[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.580]
If you'd be considered a population control.

[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.260]
Oh, right.

[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.120]
Yes, hand guns.

[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.920]
They just might make it famous.

[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.900]
The kids are learning to play now.

[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.980]
In every big city of God,

[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.060]
you let the pain now.

[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.180]
Call, teach yourself some hardware and go to the other fellow away now.

[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.480]
It's all back, gun, gun, gun.

[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.640]
I've learned how to play today.

[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.740]
I've got to stay on the street today.

[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.360]
Got a new PC started and to show in town now.

[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.640]
I'm not showing that.

[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.480]
I can tell you guys it's lunch and I'm pretty special to sell now.

[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.400]
I'm not such a dissent.

[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.700]
They can share a picture and show them up before they sell now.

[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.060]
I'm not with bother.

[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.260]
They've got guns, guns, guns.

[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.260]
I've got to stay on the street today.

[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.180]
I'm not showing that.

[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.180]
I'm not showing that.

[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.620]
I'm boys and girls.

[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.760]
You can make like three for eight.

[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.340]

[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.840]
See the proceed on your blocks.

[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.600]
Up to the cops.

[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.700]
Don't get away.

[00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.940]
Oh, hey, hey.

[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.140]
So what if Johnny can't treat you?

[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.400]
He can still turn me in.

[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.640]
I'll make that up.

[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.860]
He can't be out.

[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:46.500]
It's all back.

[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.060]
Gun, gun, gun, gun.

[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.860]
Take it all.

[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.660]
Go each other.

[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.660]
The way we're hitting.

[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.400]
Gun, gun.

[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.100]
Stay, yeah.

[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.880]
her

[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.780]
Oh

[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.440]

[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.620]
When you think of all the benefits you're getting

[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.660]
Life will be sweeter when you catch your heater

[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.540]
You carry a life and soon be deadly

[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.860]
Come on and join today

[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.560]
It's the American way

[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.420]
We are left with a lucky and alright

[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.560]
Aim for the enemy, aim for the chest

[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.400]
And always aim for the head

[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.420]
Aim for the wound

[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.360]
And not a head

[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.960]
Join the new students

[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.420]
Feel more positive, feel more positive

[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.700]
That you can spend your life to follow the

[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.740]
Come on and join today

[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.580]
And you'll be proud to say your November

[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.200]
And all the way

[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.020]
Alright, 1045, 60 WQM

[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.260]
As we continue having another great story to keep you captivated every week

[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.400]
Everybody that goes by we get another mass shooting because

[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.940]
That's the American way

[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.780]
That's right

[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.440]
By the way, a little update

[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.240]
Miami-Dade boy playing with gun shoot

[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.020]
Self and dies

[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.220]
Now this is an old story

[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.900]
This is from yesterday morning

[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.620]
Tuesday morning's fatal

[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.800]
I mean old relatively

[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.840]
Compared to last night

[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.660]
Tuesday morning's fatal shooting of a

[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.920]
14 year old boy in Southwest Miami-Dade County

[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.540]
Was another example of why kids and guns

[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.120]
Don't mix

[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.760]
Miami-Dade police spokesman Pat Brickman said

[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.600]
Alexander Dureev was playing with his uncle

[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.920]
22 caliber rifle and took a fatal shot

[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.340]
In the face died of the scene authority said

[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.100]
See there's no longer any argument

[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.900]
I hate to break the news to all you crazy people

[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.840]
All you gun huggers

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.880]
All you gun show people

[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.040]
As a matter of fact if this station had any balls at all

[00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.900]
Which of course we don't

[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.820]
Because we're just a bunch of money grabbers like everybody else in broadcasting

[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.180]
If we had any kind of conscience

[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.860]
We'd stop running those gun show spots like now

[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.940]
Now would be a real good time for our sales manager

[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.780]
In general manager

[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.000]
And all these people around here say

[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.960]
You know something that's not really a good idea

[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.120]
To be putting that crap on here

[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.420]
Because they're selling oozees

[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.140]
And AK-47s and all kinds of crap at these gun shows

[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.180]
And people are running around crazy people with guns

[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.220]
Killing everybody else

[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.800]
Including now

[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.160]
Little kids

[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.540]
Let's not take on high school kids anymore

[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.420]
That's no fun

[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.740]
Let's shoot little kids

[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.460]
Five and six and eight year old kids

[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.140]
And all ladies two hour at it

[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.260]
You know Jews, Glam, Sparsers

[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.140]
Whoever they happen to be

[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.580]
Whoever were pissed off this week

[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.920]
This is crazy

[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.360]
You go anywhere in the world

[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.960]
Do you see this?

[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.400]
No

[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.420]
Any civilized country in the world

[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.600]
Nobody's got guns

[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.420]
But in America this is the whole way of life

[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.640]
Even why it would be embarrassed by this

[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.040]
In fact this week in the

[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.660]
Not in Newsweek or time

[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.320]
But in Businessweek magazine

[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.580]
The August 16th issue which I have my hand right now

[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.620]
What's the big, the main article in here

[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.760]
Under fire

[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.540]
Guns in America

[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.820]
Pages and pages and pages and pages

[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.600]
The crime world's weapons of choice

[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.800]
An angry public gun makers are feeling the heat

[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.780]
Finally a close up look at the secret of industry

[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.780]
And here's a big article about the rest of the world

[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.760]
Guns are wounding America's image abroad

[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.000]
I've got some big kind of a bullet in there

[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.660]
Like the rest of the world looks at this

[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.900]
Like a bunch of crazy people

[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.560]
Like a bunch of barbarians

[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.760]
Everybody running around with guns

[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.020]
Now you see they said back in little in Colorado

[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.180]
The gun nuts were saying

[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.680]
Well you see this is all a morgue and also in Atlanta

[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.620]
When the guy went nuts a couple of weeks ago

[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.660]
You see if everybody inside would have had if they had all the people in the office

[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.380]
Would have had a gun

[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.480]
Then they could have blown this guy away before he shot all these people

[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.940]
How about if all the five year old kids would have had a gun

[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.860]
There you go

[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.000]
If those little kids would have just been packing some heat

[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.360]
They could have blown this bastard away

[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.820]
Oh

[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.120]
I'm sitting there watching the latest spectacle again last night

[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.920]
Till about 1115 I'm watching on the satellite

[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.220]
KTK and DC out of Los Angeles

[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.180]
And you know they got this motel surrounded

[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.640]
And the guy supposedly inside they got the Toyota out

[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.640]
The car jack car sitting out there that Toyota

[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.820]
And they got it surrounded

[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.740]
He's on the first floor and here comes the swat team

[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.720]
I get up this morning because I wasn't going to stay up all night long waiting to see what developed

[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.860]
I get up this morning and I'm flipping around MSNBC

[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.000]
CNN all over the place

[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.900]
Local channels

[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.720]
And they got this rabbi on and this one on and they're all going

[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.340]
Oh you know like that

[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.080]
And the meantime where's the guy?

[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.080]
They got the guys picture on there

[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.120]
View for furrowed junior whatever the hell this guy who lives in a trailer park

[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.260]
In Olympia Washington

[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.120]
trailer park does that give you some clues right off the bat?

[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:45.640]
Do they find him?

[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:46.360]
No

[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:46.820]
No

[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.020]
Was he in the motel?

[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.340]
And see I don't even know whatever happened

[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.880]
And in between the swat team getting ready to go in there

[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.560]
And of course you notice they take a long time

[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.880]
He was supposedly in some room there on the first floor

[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.660]
And I'm KK and DC in Los Angeles to show the responsible media

[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.800]
Keep in mind is anybody ever been in a motel

[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.100]
Where they don't have a TV set inside

[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.140]
Not in my life

[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.540]
I've never been in a motel in my life

[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.840]
Where they don't have a TV inside

[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.520]
And they're saying well we're not going to give you the name of the motel

[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.760]
I think that the guy if he was inside

[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.760]
He knows the name of the motel the seven star motel he's in

[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.340]
He knows

[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.440]
But the fact is we're showing where the cops are

[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.280]
We're showing all this on live television

[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.540]
Here's the cops up on the roof

[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.680]
The swat team is getting ready to come in right now

[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.320]
Why didn't they just call the guy on the phone in his room and say

[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.380]
Okay here's the deal

[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.520]
This is the way we got to plan out

[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.900]
This is when we're going to come in to get you

[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.540]
So you got about ten minutes to get out the window or you know get out of here

[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:39.340]
Crazy

[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.480]
And so for whatever reason the guy seems to have slipped through their fingers again

[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.060]
And he's on the loose he made of amuse

[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.820]
Buford for all junior

[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.460]
Who decided it was a good day to shoot some Jews especially little kids

[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.280]
And by the way John Henry in case you're listening you know that $400 million that you want the taxpayers to give

[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.360]
I bet that would buy a lot of metal detectors for schools all over Broward County

[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.440]
And maybe a few left over for Dave County too

[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.620]
Forget about having you know better classrooms and better teachers and more textbooks

[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:18.280]
And having a real education system maybe even like you know how about some bulletproof vests

[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.040]
Maybe that'll be next you know they will talk about having the kids where uniforms to school

[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.580]
Address code yeah okay Johnny here's your bulletproof vest

[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.680]
And you're oozy

[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.140]
Yeah

[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:38.300]
This is the new deal in America go to the airport metal detectors go to school metal detector go to a federal building

[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.660]
Metal detector because we have this is a country of crazy people with guns

[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.100]
And you wonder how long is it going to be before somebody finally says you know this has got to stop

[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:54.660]
Just because somebody wants to go target shooting or because somebody likes to go hunting you know whatever a bandy or whatever they're into

[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.660]
You know that just doesn't outweigh the idea that most people would like to be safe

[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.940]
And when they send their kids off to school in the morning they like to seem alive sometime at night

[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.980]
I like this is difficult convincing the public that this is insanity that this is crazy

[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:17.100]
And by the way a Harris poll between June 10th and June 15th this is before the last three episodes here

[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:22.040]
Show 73% of Americans now favor tougher handgun controls handgun

[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.920]
Is there any American with a brain that wants people running around with automatic weapon?

[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:34.840]
No, only Charlton Heston and his people only crazy people like Charlton Heston use son of a bitch

[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.480]
Exactly

[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:43.760]
I don't have to grow up I'm a gunner of kids I can always feel myself or something bad

[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.880]
I did get gonna be cool when I kill everyone at school

[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:56.940]
My dad said it's okay I'll exercise my right that's why we have our A that lets me be a gunner

[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.720]
I can't believe it

[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:04.320]
He's a gunner us cute I call them how to shoot what he really loves the side of what?

[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.020]
No way that guy in the cute I'm a harmless side of all

[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.820]
Not to be red next to the side on the internet

[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.820]
Oh right

[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:20.100]
I'm a lifetime number of the NRA that's why I raise the guns the roads kids here son

[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.840]
Oh boy I quit for my gun

[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.820]
I'm glad that you're a gunner

[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.180]
I'm glad that you're a gunner

[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:31.380]
All right well let's see how many people we can kill before this day is that and in fact it's interesting

[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.620]
I would say in the last couple of weeks with these various you know these what do they call them?

[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.580]
Spree shootings is it a spree shooter or a serial shooter?

[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.600]
Remember that stuff on a Koonanikrapp was going on?

[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.220]
Yeah as if it makes a difference

[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:49.660]
But at any rate in a good week in this country we can kill more than like five other countries put together do in a year just with guns

[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.720]
So maybe somebody can fill me in on what happened between the time I went to bed last night and early this morning

[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.320]
When I got the guys picture now but there's not any conversation

[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.000]
I mean you turn on your news and instead of hearing 50 rabbis in a row going oh this is terrible

[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.480]
Which we already know that how about giving us some information as to what happened at that motel

[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:13.800]
Where the guy went did he get away with the inside something give us some news instead of giving us all these hysterical people

[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.120]
Telling us this wasn't such a great thing which I think most of us already know

[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.420]
Here's Helen Dale hello

[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.340]
You know what you're doing?

[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.020]
Okay sir

[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:30.840]
You know I just find it disgusting how the US government can't learn will not refuse to learn something from Europe and how

[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:37.220]
You just sit so safe out there no one has a gun you have nothing to worry about you can walk across the street there's none of these shootings

[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:44.660]
Freeze I don't understand what it's going to take to these politicians start whizing up and and take away guns all guns

[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:49.860]
Who cares about hunting and we need safety here these kids these poor kids got shot they got none of them died

[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.020]
But this is disgusting what's happening in this country

[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:57.660]
This is the only place I can think of that I've ever been in a world where you have to worry about somebody some maniac having a gun

[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:04.420]
It doesn't happen anywhere in any supposedly westernized country it doesn't happen really I mean once in a blue moon

[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.720]
Yeah I don't understand what it's going to take and I mean

[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:13.800]
Well these people were more concerned about important things like building stadiums and arenas that's the kind of stuff that America's obsessed with you know

[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.820]
How many more ball games can we have?

[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:22.600]
I don't know I just think these politicians they they they're not it's money money money I don't know if you can't already funding them it's all NRA

[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:30.620]
It's the NRA man they got to be public in party by the balls they got them by the short hairs and that that's why no matter what how many of these things go on

[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:38.460]
Until a public steps get angry and I don't see them very angry here this morning so far until a public finally says Jesus Christ this is not a way for civilized people to live

[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.260]
There's nothing's going to change you know what for Congress okay good luck to you

[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:48.920]
Okay one caller on the board this morning thank God we got that Marlon game coming up in 1230 today the giant's in those red hot mallens

[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.360]
Anybody care about that? Oh 1230 the free game show

[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:59.700]
So that means I can get out of here early that because obviously there's a tremendous amount of burning amount of interest in this topic this morning

[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:14.320]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line look at that are these people whipped up to a frenzy no are they pissed off and fired up no are they firing it out there to God then fire and range no they're firing it

[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:24.700]
See when when you're that crazy that you become you become a custom you accept this that this is the way I've told you this a million times this is the way life is supposed to be

[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:30.620]
Then you're as bad as the people that are running around with a gun you're crazy you're a lunatic you're a crazy person

[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.880]
If you believe that this is the way you're supposed to live your life

[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:40.880]
Every single day oh gee here's another kid roll 14 year old kid he's dead why because somebody had a gun laying around

[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:48.720]
You can you can go out and I was reading an article yesterday before this thing happened about it's easier to buy a gun than a guy damn pack of cigarettes

[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:57.740]
And that's the goddamn truth just like those kids out there in Colorado they could they were old enough to buy a gun legally but not a can of beer or a pack of cigarettes

[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.460]
What does that tell you about the sickness in this country?

[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:09.060]
Here's Parkland hello hello Neil yes sir how you doing this morning I'm psychotic I can tell listen

[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:35.500]

on us we got to come up with all this money to build a stadium we don't care about the fact that we got a handful of gun nuts of lunatics running the whole

[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:51.660]
country and jeopardizing your life and your kids and everybody else on every street corner nobody cares about that how are we going to come up with a

[00:16:51.660 --> 00:17:05.980]
lot of money to build a new stadium that's what we care about so that some multi billionaire can continue playing games God is it's sick I can't I'm counting the days till I can get out of this

[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:15.460]
God damn crazy country and it is it's a crazy frickin country and if that sounds un-American you'll bet your sweet ass I am un-American because this isn't the

[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:31.460]
civilized place it's a barbaric slaughterhouse mobile in Fort Lauderdale hello hello me yes I think they ought to stop shooting people yeah okay thanks here's a mobile in Miami hello hello yes

[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:37.300]
sir yeah Neil did you see on channel seven had about this girl that was in a blow up the junior high school and they sent a

[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:43.520]
third to a year in a maximum security for juvenile yeah and they were crying about it was such a hard sentence

[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:53.060]
but she had a website just like all these other people I say 10 to 20 sounds minimum to me I think so I'm going to worry you know when I was a kid I'm only 25 years old now but when I was a kid if you pull

[00:17:53.060 --> 00:18:00.000]
something like that you wouldn't be around for a year you want like 10 to 20 right exactly it's right and I hate to break the

[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.540]
news to all these bleeding hearts out there but when so when somebody who said juvenile blows your crap away you're just as dead as if they were

[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:10.040]
40 years old yeah what about this 12 year old kid they killed the six year old and now they're saying that they're

[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:18.100]
have to let them out the kid you got beat up inside all right you do to the six year old girl you'd be the crap out of her and kill her didn't just get the crap out of her he murdered her

[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:23.800]
yeah but then he gets a little little beat up parents in in the prison so they got like well just remember he's got connections you know yeah

[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.720]
there you mom he's got connections right oh god have a good day then and back to you all right but I'm

[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.920]
going to get too heavy here today doing huh oh are we do now I just I just would like to know what the

[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.980]
saturation point is in the public out there at what point you finally say I mean like this jerk to a

[00:18:53.640 --> 00:19:00.460]
insane people running around 30 40 50 thousand year that's only with handguns by the way forget about the

[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:08.820]
oozees and all the other automatic weapons just the handguns 30 and 40 and 50 thousand like

[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:14.260]
the words like talking it's like taking a can of Raid and killing a bunch of ants that's how much

[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:22.120]
we value human life in America like stepping on a guy named Ant Hill here's a mobile in Miami hello

[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:26.740]
hello there yes sir I just wanted to ask you a question as far as the guns and portals are

[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:31.420]
concerned is it a just an issue of their constitutional right to have a gun or is it more

[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.740]
that's what they make it into that's what they claim it is but they're sick they're obsessed with

[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:41.200]
guns a gun is a phallic object to them so there's no like money situation nobody's making money

[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.160]
off the fact of course the gun manufacturer to jogganist are an enormous business it's a multi-billion

[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.280]
dollar business of course okay I just want to I just want the correct fire to find out what it

[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:56.120]
more so the their constitutional right to have the gun or what are they still not far as it more like

[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:01.740]
money or is the contribution of right is just an excuse okay okay okay all right thanks for saying

[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:07.060]
opal just say no just say no to stadiums just say no to have penny sales tax just say no to more

[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:12.600]
gun no just say no to Charlton has no to the NRA just say no no more crap just say no to these

[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.780]
crazy Republicans who are in bed who are who are just own lock stock and barrel if you're part in

[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:25.060]
the barrel part by the by the NRA every time you know we had the little thing and oh yeah we're

[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:31.460]
gonna do this so we're gonna do that in Congress do anything no no and I think it's about

[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.260]
God damn time these media people who are of course exploiting this in our love and man they did

[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.580]
this they're they're moist they're like forming a place where it's illegal in Broward County

[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:46.960]
because they love this stuff how about a gigantic expose on this NRA and all this crap and about

[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:52.060]
the thing that I'm got in my hand right now from business week magazine you know once in a while

[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.020]
like a few weeks ago they had a piece on 60 minutes or one of the 48 hours whatever it is but not

[00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:02.020]
enough now how about talking about how it is in other countries where this stuff doesn't go on

[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.980]
where you can actually walk the streets three in the afternoon three in the morning and you're not

[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.160]
worried about somebody getting shot right and send your kids to school and don't have to worry

[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:16.320]
about whether they're gonna come home alive or in a box in a body bag you show me a country where

[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:21.380]
there's no value on human life and I'll show you a place that's in real big serious trouble baby

[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:28.420]
and you're in it you're right in the middle of it here's Miami hello hey Neil yes sir I'll give you

[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:34.880]
an example of exactly what the problem is I was listening to Hank yesterday this guy called in

[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:40.880]
this is maybe 10 15 minutes after your show maybe even heard it and got called in and a

[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:47.060]
Hank had just found out about the shooting in California is that where was California right and

[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:52.680]
he made some comments about it how unbelievable it was and next car comes on he's like yeah that's

[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:58.480]
that's unbelievable I just don't understand what these people are thinking and without skipping

[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.300]
a beat anyway did you hear Jimmy this morning what he said and they went right into oh right oh

[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:07.220]
you you've got to understand this radio station 20 hours a day I mean it's one dimension I've

[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.700]
put it this before they could be dropping nuclear weapons on Jacksonville and we'd still be here talking

[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.260]
about hey you think that Tony Martin's going to get off from that rap so we can play for that

[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.620]
off and do we still be talking crap on here I mean there comes a point in your life when there

[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.940]
are some things that are more important by so far real life we're not talking about fun and games

[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:29.160]
we're talking about real life that they so far supersede this crap but the the moron the sports

[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:35.040]
nerd nothing really matters to them except you know we go in the ballgame well it seems like we can

[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:40.620]
whenever we need a stadium we can free up hundreds of millions of dollars and at the same time

[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.600]
we're hearing about how our public schools are failing and we're going to have to give vouchers to

[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:52.240]
people so they can bail out you know I don't hear any self-tax votes for improving the public

[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.220]
schools so we don't have to send our kids to or or having more security in public schools and

[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.480]
also in places like like this daycare center yesterday and how about you know the JDL which

[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.600]
I'm not a big fan of there's the Jewish defense league which are very millivent but maybe they

[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.360]
got a point maybe if there was some now JDL guy with an oozy standing there guarding the doorway

[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:13.560]
maybe this guy might have gone someplace else well I don't know I don't think more guns and

[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:18.420]
everybody think I've been to the wild west and we already already got it yeah that's true well

[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:24.200]

[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:20.060]
crazy person Tom G NRA life member nice going Tom it says Neil is a bootlicking socialist how do you

[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:26.640]
like that it says this country was founded on religious nuts with guns how do you like that for a

[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:31.040]
start religious nuts with guns the second amendment protects your right to say whatever

[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:35.120]
that you want no I hate to break the news you Tom it's the first amendment okay not the second

[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:40.580]
amendment that's the one you're all worked up about guess what millions of law abiding honors

[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:45.560]
gun owners did nothing evil yesterday don't vilify the gun because it's an inanimate object it does

[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:50.700]
not cause the evil user our socialist and we defenders of the bill of rights and the constitution

[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:55.780]
will always defeat you in your ilk study history a little bit and learn of what happens to a disarmed

[00:24:55.780 --> 00:25:00.660]
populist they're massacred by their government good luck to you sir Tom G NRA life member

[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:05.620]
yeah all those countries in western Europe all those people are being massacred by their governments

[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:11.680]
and have been for hundreds and hundreds of years have an a no no in addition to which I hate to

[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:16.120]
break the news to you they had a piece on this just a week ago coincidentally after the Atlanta

[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:21.840]
massacre about what the second amendment really means and what the intent was and they pointed out

[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:26.520]
that back during colonial days a very tiny percentage I think was like three or four percent of the

[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:33.260]
public actually owned any kind of weapon any kind of firearm of course we didn't have no oozee

[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:40.140]
back then damn it but of course the time he's an expert he knows his crack and then he didn't have

[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.180]
to waste his time with the rest of the facts he should have just ended after the first sentence

[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:48.100]
this country was founded on religious nuts with guns all right let's hear it for religious nuts

[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:54.080]
with guns nice going Tom G you're a genius you're a rocket scientist you're a typical NRA moron

[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.460]
in the still hope you have a great time hope you and Charlton has to know

[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:05.880]
let's see what comes out on top so to speak here's a lady in my any hello

[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:11.380]
hey Neil you know that movie was packed off in an R.I.S. Schwarzenegger I think it was roller dome or

[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:16.440]
where they're you know they they turned violence into entertainment like a like a game show

[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:21.620]
well that's what the media has done that it's a form of entertainment now I think to the media

[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:29.280]
oh yeah they're loving it Fox Fox News Network CNN if the NBC MSNBC all these talking head people

[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.880]
they're loving it in fact last night I'm flipping around all the channels to see what information

[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:39.040]
I'm getting here's Larry King tonight and he presents it like like it's an entertainment show

[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:44.120]
tonight and who does he bring out that jury spence again at terrible god damn lawyer there from

[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:49.540]
Macolorado all the same old tired talking heads pontificating about violence on television and

[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:54.400]
all of a sudden bullcrap yep and and I don't think I don't really blame the public as much as the media

[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:59.440]
because I think we've been spoon fed so that we're desensitized now by what the media's

[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:05.400]
condition does to to react to you know I don't I don't let's make sure we keep almost

[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.340]
pot smokers in jail because guns are great they're important they're like shoveling an apple pie

[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.640]
yeah they're the most harmless people in the world are you know pot smokers they're

[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.100]
they're the most passive people in the world yeah man okay bye bye

[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:23.200]
yeah let's make sure we keep our prisons and jails loaded with all those pot growers and pot smokers

[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:28.160]
because that's the threat to all you safe law-abiding Americans out there not crazy people religious

[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.760]
nuts with guns to quote my good friend Tom G a lifelong NRA member nice going Tom Greenline

[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:41.000]
religious nuts with guns here's a lady in Miami hello hi Neil yes ma'am how a question for you

short show today two and a half hours I'm not interested in the Atkins diet today I'm not

[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.520]
interested in how's Cory saving dude over there in Fort Myers we wish him our best we're

[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.800]
talking today about something you know I hate a little more important than are we gonna have

[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:07.400]
four hundred million dollars for a stupid stadium give me a fricking break okay get a brain sweet heart

[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.960]
let's hope that she's been sterilized already so she don't wind up reproducing God for bid

[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.540]
fourth sterilization just keep that in mind that's the most important two words you'll ever

[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:21.960]
hear in your life fourth sterilization that's the only hope for the future of this country let me

[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:29.980]
tell you that right now here's Hollywood hello yeah yes sir yeah Neil you know I never had it

[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:35.200]
done in my life and I started are you better get with it man no no no no no no you know I started

[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:40.760]
going along on this theory of team maybe I want to get on you know and then I read about those

[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:46.840]
those six cops up a thing you look who had that little Dominican guy who were just coming

[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:52.480]
home from work they had him in a little hallway uh-huh and six trained police officers who

[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:57.420]
been with it all six six thousand shots right it took six out the only animated team times right

[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.760]
they had them in a shoe in a foot in the knee yeah yeah well as I yesterday there were like

[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.220]
hundreds around he was firing all over the place so you know with his oozey or whatever it was

[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:09.660]
and only you I want to appear hitting five people so you know how can you have people out there

[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:13.780]
with guns who are not trained you know like they call around all thing with those those

[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:18.400]
they would have shot more or the kids more the students come at the house if you got six guys

[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:24.500]
who can't hear the guy all right the fact is that a sane country doesn't allow its citizens to

[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:29.920]
walk around with guns and to walk into a gun show like it's some kind of a recreational sporting

[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.880]
event and just by every kind of automatic weapon and grotesque conceivable weapon onto the sun

[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.880]
without any kind any kind of anything you know the Supreme Court also reviewed the second

[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:45.000]
amendment to deal in case you you want to up on this thing and they said that if we are allowed

[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.620]
to arm militia right individuals that's right that's what it was intended for that's exactly what

[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:55.040]
it's actually what it's they said so that's why the states have the right to ban guns that they wish

[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.780]
like you remember do you are at the Sullivan War for all of you as I grew up in New York you couldn't

[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.200]
carry a little good knife well you you you ain't you ain't seen nothing yet man it's going to

[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.900]
really get heavy duty now a lot of you know it's it's about time a lot of people scream like

[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:13.140]
okay thanks thanks let me say it again because I'm on my what was it limperasted facts socialist whatever

[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:17.600]
that the times you that faxes let me say it again a Harris pool conducted before these last three

[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:23.400]
incidents the one up there in Atlanta the one in Alabama now this one in Los Angeles 73%

[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.840]
of Americans not favorite tougher handgun controls I'm sure would have been like 95% against the

[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:33.820]
the sale of all these automatic weapons Chicago detroit more than other 20 other cities if I have

[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:38.520]
lost it's blaming the firearms industry for the staggering toll of urban handgun violence and

[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:43.100]
are seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages just like they might have to the tobacco

[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.400]
industry they're going after the gun manufacturers and believe me they're going to nail their

[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:52.160]
ash to the wall because civilized people don't want to live like this just so Tom G can talk about

[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.220]
what a macho guy he is and he can sit around with his NRA buddies and polish their peace

[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.940]
and he's probably waxing it right now he's dead weapon

[00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:03.740]
he's just hope to come out that he should say I will run run run never put his jealousy go away

[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:08.840]
you're run to the post can she feel fine run run run never put his jealousy go away

[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:14.040]
245 60 WQM unfortunately we got that horseball a Marlon and Giants game in 1230 this afternoon

[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.900]
with a pregame show anyway here's the facts the facts as I'm getting here this morning so far

[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:22.060]
our paranoid and delusional like this one from our good friend Eddie and homestead who says

[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:27.660]
you hear this Neil what happened in California was terrible but you cannot love all of us with

[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:32.240]
those crazy idiots I really don't care what you're a pastor say about the United States and I will

[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:37.540]
never give up my right to own a firearm I will support tougher gun laws short of banning them love

[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:43.520]
you show Eddie and homestead I will never give up my right to own a firearm how do you like that so

[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.940]
in other words Eddie and homestead is so obsessed with guns and with his right to have one that no

[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:52.360]
matter how much jeopardy that places all while biting people and he will never give up his right

[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:56.400]
because that's the American F and way and he doesn't care that the rest of the civilized world

[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.980]
thanks for a bunch of barburetory he don't care about anybody thanks don't confuse any with the

[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:06.680]
facts paranoia rain supreme in Eddie's house here's a mobile in Miami hello yeah how you doing

[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:12.360]
Neil okay sir I don't want to take a position on pro guns because I would wish that all guns

[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:17.020]
would be removed from our society but something disturbs me here yes this is a federal bureau

[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:22.360]
investigation statistic if the only one I have it's the only one I know this valid of all the people

[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:30.760]
that were arrested last year 1998 violation of gun existing gun laws only 20 percent of those people

[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:37.560]
were prosecuted that's alarming yeah so the existing gun laws apparently are not the problem

[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:42.220]
and more gun laws doesn't appear to be the reason that I let people walk into a gun show and

[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:47.500]
by automatic weapons and so the bill that they passed in 1994 and I'm not I'm not I'm on another

[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:52.800]
defensive motion just saying what disturbs me all I do was interject one thing and you you get very

[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:57.560]
defensive as soon as I said it no but I'm not you're you're you're changing the subject

[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:04.520]
no I'm not you're talking about Neil sir hang up calm down aren't you alarm that the existing gun

[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.660]
I don't I don't talk to assholes like that okay if you want to have a conversation you say

[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:14.400]
your piece which I listen for like 45 seconds I try to make one point that the existing laws don't

[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:18.460]
have any teeth especially because of the NRA and the gun nuts and the Republicans the right wing

[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:22.100]
Republicans and that's you don't even let me get my point it no you don't want to make a point

[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:27.120]
for guns but as soon as I start making an alternative point but I don't get excited I don't talk

[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:33.300]
to assholes like you sir this is a talk show it means I talk you talk it's called a conversation

[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.300]

[00:36:56.180 --> 00:37:01.420]
week the piece that in the CBS news was great back in colonial days a very tiny percentage of

[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:05.980]
the public even had muskets the whole the whole concept of the second amendment was for a

[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:09.680]
militia not not so that individuals could run around with a bunch of firearms you know and as far

[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.800]
as you know you see the entertainment value of it and I agree I'm watching Fox News and it's like

[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:18.620]
rampage you know but they got it this is how they're gonna there's 500 somewhat channels they're

[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:23.320]
gonna get the word out but well everyone's gonna know but when you see an idiot like Gary Bauer

[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.240]
who's running for president and again he's preaching you know well gotta get back to God

[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:31.720]

[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:45.060]
local minister Reverend Don Harp during a memorial service in Atlanta for victims of that

[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:49.580]
recent office massacre up there said it's harder to get a prescription filled than to buy a

[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:57.260]
handgun in the United States nice go on Reverend pop goes the weasel and then of course in the

[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:02.460]
same newsweek magazine that I got yesterday I think it was in here I hope so they got oh here it is

[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:07.960]
this is this is I thought that the article last week about that Hispanic business that bullcrap

[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:16.420]
was bad this is worse an article by Susan Folludi contributing editor from newsweek author of

[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:21.320]
the forthcoming stiff the betrayal of the American man she's got a whole article here about why

[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:27.220]
the American male does these things only a few deranged men go on shooting sprees but many

[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:33.300]
feel cheated that the system has let them down and in some powerful ways it has we're supposed to

[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:38.100]
relate to this guy in Atlanta that went in in shot twelve people because he was a gay a day trader

[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:43.400]
on that's right must have been his lifestyle he was a gay trader like I was right

[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:51.200]
I mean this article is the worst piece of swill we're supposed to now start looking for the

[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:56.200]
reasons that these people have been the let down by society just like those kids in little

[00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:01.420]
ten society let them down and as a result they were pissed off and fired up and whipped up to a

[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:05.620]
frenzy so let's go kill some people to let our frustrations because it's the American F and

[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:11.320]
you're crazy Susan and the people at newsweek are crazy are from putting this swill in there to try

[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:19.860]
somehow to rationalize and justify why crazy people do this crap here's a lady in Hollywood hello

[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:25.760]
hi Neil yes man I agree with you completely I'm very upset about this thing that happened out

[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:07.460]
Neil's a bad guy that was sick that was pretty sick yeah but um anyway while the swat team was sitting

[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:13.100]
in front of the hotel I understand yes the guy was on his way down on catching a bus or on the highway

[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:17.460]
or something heading out of town yeah I love the way these swat teams just like at little thing you

[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:21.760]
know the two the two murderers the two kids have been dead for hours and the cops are surrounding

[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:25.520]
the school and the swat teams and they go in and they're leading the kids up in the meantime the

[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:29.380]
murderers have been dead for hours people are bleeding to death inside you know like that teacher

[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:33.280]
but in the meantime they're out there in there you know I and they said well see we don't want to

[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:37.320]
needlessly risk their lives I thought that's what they got paid to do with the ghost saving us

[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:41.580]
in people and risk their lives in a process and how come last night they're they're thinking and

[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.540]
they're talking and they're plotting and planning and in the meantime the guys probably watching

[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:48.900]
in the television he gets out the guy damn window he's on a bus who down knows where he is

[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:54.420]
he's gone but I saw my side of the schoolhouse chicken over mattresses and chicken cans and you know

[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:58.100]
all this other crap while the guy is gone yeah so I'm just going to sit back and listen to

[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:04.580]
people bash you about how we should have guns in America okay thank you man okay yeah the gun

[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:09.400]
squeezes baby oh that's neil that's socialist bag he's a bad guy comey pit go fag

5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a mobile one line I'll tell you one thing that bitch he ought to be

[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.580]

[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:38.400]
Beach hello say nil yes sir yes you probably cares more about the Kennedys than she does a little

[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:42.760]
kid yeah oh I see a great parallel don't you between a guy who got you know had a plane crash

[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:49.220]
yeah the magazine and millions of dollars yeah only 200 million yeah well two things about this the

[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:54.440]
first thing that makes me sick is if I'm watching television and a gun show commercial come on yeah

[00:42:54.440 --> 00:43:01.100]
and then they show the father with like three or four year old son on his shoulders where an

[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:07.420]
army fatigue you know that's a great way to bring your son up yeah you know to let's go kill some

[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:11.500]
real it into their head Johnny let's go kill something now yeah let's go kill something for

[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:16.400]
Christ yeah and then not just that but look what was in that guy's van it's not just guns he had

[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:23.060]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line did he say she out I think he did say she out

[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:30.300]
and there he slipped one in there on me here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale hello Mr. Rogers speaking

[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:37.760]
I bail from the same part of the country that you originally come from yes upstate New York area

[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:46.340]
small community I grew up with guns I mean hunting and fishing yeah that type of

[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:57.560]
thing to respect a weapon I'm a career military person yes sir former green beret yeah

[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:08.980]
this whole thing is very upsetting to me I have hand guns I have rifles and shotguns

[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:14.160]
I have so many I mean the way you make it sound like like how many like 20 or 30 50

[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:19.140]
I have a nice collection worth a lot of money yeah

[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:27.100]
they have them all locked away safely behind everything's taking care of me as far as that concern yeah

[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:38.320]
I have my concealed handgun permit for the state of Florida I don't I don't feel comfortable without

[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:43.640]
a gun on my person because of the way society is now a day yeah I understand that I'm not a

[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:49.400]
wacko I would never do well nobody nobody who nobody who the people are perpetrating these crimes

[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:54.200]
would never say their wacko is either nobody says hey guess what I'm a wacko look out nobody says that

[00:44:54.200 --> 00:45:01.140]
I understand that Mr. Rogers right I this this is very disturbing to me yeah you already said that

[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:07.900]
these these killings all over the time so what is the point the point is that how do you separate

[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:12.920]
a lot of biting citizens you don't you don't what you do is you take guns away from people and

[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:17.260]
you stop having innocent people being slaughtered by maniacs with guns that's the best way to do it

[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:21.080]
see if it's a responsible country like in Switzerland and it'll let where they're all members of

[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.180]
the military they all can have guns and they're not running around blowing each other's brains out

[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:28.420]
this doesn't happen they're okay so when responsible people demonstrate that they're capable of

[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:32.080]
doing it then you let them have them when the country shows overwhelmingly that there are too many

[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:38.060]
irresponsible people you don't let individuals have guns period that's the answer sir and hope you

[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.060]
sell your collection to make a lot of money

[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.700]
there like J.F.K.

[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.620]
good a sport a better play

[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.200]
it's J.F.K. at 4.5

[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:22.100]
you don't know a five or something cheap and crappy dreams that flow

[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:25.880]
a burning that my head's about the only way

[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.220]
I could say

[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:34.060]
now let me show the ones that left alive today

[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:37.280]
from what they call the Kennedy curse

[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:42.260]
if Dorothy Hill Gallen was alive she'd say

[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:46.060]
you're a bitch only gonna get the worst

[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.940]
we miss you the sound of gunshots all night

[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:50.980]

[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:56.400]
article in Saturday's uh... some set no i did not thank god he was addressing

[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.720]
the uh... teachers in the uh... swing club

[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.820]
and he wrote that people are now calling the sunset moment school board

[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.120]
turning in teachers who are living together

[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.020]
unmarried

[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.860]
so obviously the reason our schools are failing inward they're shooting up our

[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:11.800]
capital our schools is that we have adults

[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.440]
who are living together on their own

[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:15.380]
unbelievable

[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:16.740]
not that

[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:18.860]
schools are failing because of

[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:20.260]
they can't read a right

[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:21.840]
they blame lifestyle

[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:24.020]
right everything is not really right

[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.280]
it's all about the bookers out there

[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:30.600]
they think your left-caller you probably support the marlin state in thinking

[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.880]
that self-sales gun well you know i'd listen to that guy you know he went through

[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.560]
his whole life story the green beret this is that fifty million hand guns and

[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.000]
oozee's innocent and

[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.900]
and then he tells me well i'm not a nut you know i'm responsible person

[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:42.960]
and i'm thinking of myself

[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:48.560]
and you think it's a habit of a ballgame say that the dolphins or the heat

[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.280]
they'd react a little differently

[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:52.500]
you know because i would interfere with the entertainment

[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:56.140]
you know we don't want to do that that's the last thing we need we can't afford to

[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:59.540]
be school with ball games especially around to i am and get the last thing we

[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:00.060]
could afford

[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:03.540]
yeah and and again of course the marlins can afford that because then they're

[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.920]
only get like eighteen twenty people showing up as it is

[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.460]
you think if people bring in their hand guns that might help them uh...

[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:11.480]
the stadium or maybe they can have like a gun show out there you know

[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.300]
great beyond the first baseline would be good

[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:15.800]
yeah they killed someone as long as they can play ball well

[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.180]
we'll sign them just shoot them in the leg

[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.040]
okay that's it and have a great day

[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.920]
here let's get to the important things okay let's get to those stadiums how

[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.240]
many can we build before the god damn millennia is over

[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:30.100]
shoot them in the leg right five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty

[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.080]
on the eighteen t wireless line

[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.480]
yeah everything you see i've told you this before the public it's the sense

[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:39.660]
of ties to become numb it's like oh yeah here's another big story this week

[00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.860]
it was Atlanta last week and then the gun all about which there was only three

[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:44.340]
people didn't make a big splash with that

[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:47.400]
and then i shouldn't have said splash and then we got the uh... you know five

[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.800]
kids in Los Angeles yesterday

[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.000]
shooting little kids can't shoot each other and you know something the

[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.560]
public goes along the merry way here all the lividest these are not the things

[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.640]
that are important to the american public they don't care and that's why you

[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.740]
live in a slaughterhouse

[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:05.240]
is a mobile in my mirror mar hello

[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:09.600]
hey uh... before i get to my point i think that what do you mean uh... you

[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.480]
shouldn't say splash i missed that one

[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:15.580]
i don't want to get that bitch upset with a challenge on the whole okay now

[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:16.840]
she still in morning

[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.020]
two things i want to bring up

[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:20.380]
he still a couple pieces

[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:24.960]
my daughter goes to a jewish day camp in there there was a half a dozen

[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:28.500]
cops there this morning and i got explained to my kid why there's cops there

[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:28.860]
right

[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:29.980]
it sucks

[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.220]
you know i mean it's part being jewish people hate you for being

[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:37.600]
jewish and i'm about to do you know i mean i don't know this isn't a

[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.020]
jewish problem sir the people are the

[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:40.520]
well i mean

[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:46.040]
i i know i'm not i'm not saying it is certainly is not but you know that we do

[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:50.340]
it for you yesterday it was and in lanta it wasn't and the guy that you

[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:53.860]
shepherd up in my own thing that wasn't uh... you know it in the fact is that we

[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:57.260]
got a lot of sick crazy bigoted people and a lot of your responsible people

[00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.920]
running around and that's bad enough but when they're all running around with

[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:00.340]
weapons

[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:04.560]
then we know it makes a lot more dangerous worse i know here's the other point i

[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:05.360]
wanted to bring up

[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.760]
about the handgun situation at home

[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:12.600]
uh... you never read in the paper about somebody who has a handgun at home for

[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:16.020]
protection killing someone that broke into their house you want to go once in a

[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:19.040]
great while very rarely never i i don't ever

[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.220]
ever get you

[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:25.380]
very well but every week somebody's kid find their gun kills him right

[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.560]
that that's what handguns in the home do

[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:32.620]
and i'll never have a gun in my house it's just uh...

[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:35.260]
we had to run yesterday morning i read the story at the beginning of the

[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:38.300]
show to fourteen year old kid in date county and that they were dealing around

[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.100]
with his uncle's twenty two caliber rifle and

[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:40.980]
sorry

[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:42.640]
for you know he's dead

[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:47.040]
you know at least they changed the laws in one way is they make the the gun owner

[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:49.400]
have some copability right that's right

[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.820]
but it doesn't stop the kids from getting killed

[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:56.380]
it's after the fact that what kind of a person and this is there's a lot of

[00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:56.860]
said before

[00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:01.380]
responsible people don't leave their kids land their guns laying out where their

[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:03.160]
kids can get them or somebody else can get

[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:03.240]
them

[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:08.220]
you're out and how many and how many crimes by the way recommended by people who

[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:11.040]
steal those guns that you're talking about that people might protect themselves

[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:14.820]
that's another thing i mean that you know i've never been i've kind of been on

[00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:18.240]
the fence about it because it never affected the one way or the other but you

[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:21.120]
know what it might and i hope something gets done before it does

[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:22.440]
okay

[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.100]
good luck to us all

[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:28.900]

practice when you're sitting there on the fence pal

i agree with you on the issues here my father lived in uh... in germany for a

[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:32.880]
little while

[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:38.860]
yeah and uh... you live there for a while and only people have done the

[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:41.700]
least in germany i haven't been to any other places in europe and

[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.940]

yeah and uh... you know the world around with her who's these and everything

[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.780]
nobody bothers anybody it's all pretty mellow and i hope people in italy with

[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:55.620]
guns are the uh... policia and the uh... mafia the mafia don't shoot like innocent

[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:56.420]
people you know

[00:53:56.420 --> 00:54:01.460]
and basically here people are shooting each other other than the the nucks with

[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:02.120]
the you know

[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:06.700]
there are like the gang members and stuff like that in this country but

[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:11.920]
might i really don't have a problem with uh... giving up my gun i i use it

[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:15.720]
to each other year for hunting you know if the government made some kind of law

[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:20.240]
prohibiting you know gun you know making the second amendment from constitutional

[00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:22.140]
what i would do it mean if they

[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:26.420]
that they don't have to be made on constant so i got to do is interpret it the way

[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:29.720]
it was written and has to do with a militia not with the right of individuals to be

[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.740]
running around with uh... you know all kinds of firearms

[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:35.440]
with collections of every kind of weapon with bombs and hand grenades and all

[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:39.060]
the other stuff that there's no case in california uh... this is gotta stop

[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:43.380]
i agree agree i mean if they if they would make people

[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:47.060]
basically give up their guns i would do it if they paid me for it you know get me

[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.440]
for my guns i would care

[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:49.300]
you know

[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:54.220]
and uh... when i was one or those you know only twenty five years old but when i

[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:55.180]
remember growing up

[00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:58.720]
pretty much during the seventies i don't recall issues like this ever really

[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.940]
happening as much as they do now exactly well i can recall growing up before you

[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:06.100]
did when there were no there were no metal detectors in airports there was no

[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:09.820]
such thing as putting your luggage to a metal detector because and also there

[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:12.860]
was not this business i saw peace they had a little last night about how they

[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:16.940]
the statistics are better at how many kids were expelled or suspended from school

[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:20.460]
in the country last year for bringing in weapons to school there was no such thing

[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:23.100]
when i went to school it was it was unheard of it didn't happen

[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.380]
right i want the school

[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:29.140]
i grew up sixteen years up in upstate new york uh... the cap skills and then i i

[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:31.980]
was i've been down here for about ten years i want the high school down here i

[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:32.740]
want to kill you

[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:36.900]
down south and candle there and uh... i remember one day coming into school

[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:41.600]
and i'm walking into the park and i see like swat team and all these police

[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:45.180]
they're coming out and then i see two kids can thrown up on the car and they

[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:49.180]
threw like a a spot off shotgun on the car and a pistol in the car too

[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:53.720]
they can't just call the seldom great i mean well that's down here i mean it but

[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.640]
it's everywhere that's that's the problem is it's not just down here it's not

[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:00.820]
just an l.a. or in york or in the big city no i see a lot that's right and it's an

[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:04.740]
alabama it's happening almost and i think suspension and expulsion that that's

[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:08.360]
to for sure i think the kids that bring guns to school i think they ought to go to

[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.440]
jail for like minimum three-year sentence will be good

[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:15.060]
i'd be great i mean i i agree with the people i think put the gun crazy people

[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.960]
in there nobody's calling each other with a joint

[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:21.400]
i agree i mean it's just like i said in europe you go there you see how

[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:25.080]
civilized everything is nobody's nothing ever happened i've never seen any

[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:25.960]
problems in japan

[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:30.100]
right on their subways no problems nothing i mean people were nice to each

[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:30.320]
other

[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:33.360]
hello goodbye and elevators and things like that

[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:36.280]

nil yes sir i'm a twenty year member handgun control so if i get too political

[00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:46.000]
to charge up just not to be out my soapbox

[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.660]
but uh...

[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:51.380]
you know a caller couple times ago mentioned you know you know you learn to

[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:55.680]
learn by the you know the the lack of the prosecutor or rate you know and

[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:58.100]
they don't prosecute people you know so forth

[00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:02.340]
that is vintage in our aid language if you go into the website or read their

[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:04.600]
literature yeah i don't have to come to the

[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.380]
community of one of their people on the talking head show they

[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:10.920]
they spot the same crap it's not a problem having a guns out there it's the

[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:14.200]
it's the enforcement that's bad they're not putting these to let's office

[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.900]
game let's offer smoke screen and all of that book wrap and let and of course what

[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:19.360]
does that have to do with all the

[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:22.880]
uh... thousands and thousands of people all these kids are getting blown away

[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:27.800]
i'd like to skid my me yesterday right it just offense me that you know that

[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.840]
if you're liberal or if you're democrat or even if you're middle of the road

[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:34.460]
that you're automatically pro criminal yeah and the anti

[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.580]
criminal and you know

[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:41.400]
very much in favor of really prosecuting people but also at the same time you

[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.820]
know be being favor of reasonable you know gun control measures

[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:49.120]
it's not a blocker wide issue is is it would make it up any person that's a

[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.700]
rational human being that's been anywhere outside this country anywhere civil

[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:57.140]
outside this country realizes this isn't the way that people are supposed to live

[00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:02.080]
there's just real two quick things i'd like to say because right now congresses and recess

[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:09.140]
and when they reconvene there is a very important child safety protection law up

[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.900]
hr one five zero one and if i may give can i give you the what's i'd trust to hand

[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:20.120]
control because it's rather than give out numbers just get on there if you're

[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:24.160]
interested in getting active or just sing what you can do about uh... passing

[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:24.780]
this bill

[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:26.660]
get on w-w-w

[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:30.960]
it's all one word handgun control dot org

[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.660]
it has a couple of things if you look at the site map it'll tell you what you can

[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:35.620]
do and so forth

[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.900]
and then the other thing i would tell you just if nothing salt you know your

[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:42.080]
intelligence but for the people that bring up the second amendment thing

[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.620]
uh... basically nine times that has been

[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:50.360]
tried to be redefined by out of the supreme court or federal court of nine times

[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:55.060]
is been struck down as it is it is it the second amendment is open to

[01:00:55.780 --> 01:01:00.220]
state right redefining your reapplying it as as they see fit

[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:04.580]
so they're all for nine on that so you know they never read the second clause of

[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:07.760]
the second amendment they just seem to concentrate on the phrase right to bear

[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.180]
on

[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:13.580]
so um... that is just that uh... another you know inaccurate thing that they

[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:16.040]
would like to believe okay keep it up and okay thanks

[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:18.800]

yeah i mean we can't we can't stop the camp solver but we should be able to

[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.060]
make an attempt by first of all banning these guy then gun shows they should be

[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:28.020]

they pass all these laws and you know what the innocent people will be left without

[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.500]
the guns of people who are in all of the other part of it is no more plea bargain

[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:41.660]

penis

you know okay that same guy is before he's got a written down evidently two things

[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.920]
for you you had two things an hour ago when you called my home upon you at

[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.740]
the same point after you got the penis out

[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:26.780]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the he started on a thought

[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:30.360]
wait a minute is this an instant replay is this a paper running hour what

[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.300]
here's south day hello

[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.700]
yes sir

[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:38.200]
well i don't want to direct from what are how many weapons he's got

[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:44.020]
i don't expect from the work on conversation you have into the topic but

[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:47.740]
i did want to clarify some things i have a police officer

[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:50.800]
and uh... it's not our job to lay down our lives

[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:52.840]
aimlessly for

[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:57.620]
no way wait a minute nobody said laid down your lives aimlessly but the idea that

[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:01.400]
police officers risk their lives to protect other people that's part of the job

[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.060]
every day sir

[01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:02.540]
and

[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:07.040]
when you're going to go into a lot of situations like that you need to be prepared

[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.140]
and you have a strategy

[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.660]
well how many hours does it take

[01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:13.180]
well i can tell you this much i wasn't there

[01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:16.380]
but i don't know how to run a radio station and i'm not about to tell you

[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:16.780]
that it was

[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:20.160]
so i thought i was going to ask you

[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.540]
so in other words the public can't ever question what are the

[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.740]
rules they could make sure you can have questions

[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:28.880]
but i'm here to lend an opinion on it

[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.300]
that i would have confidence

[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:33.920]
in the police that they know what they're doing so they always know what they're

[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:37.320]
doing just like in the john that investigation and just like the oj prostitution

[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:40.900]
when you bring in when you bring in an srt which is a squat

[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:45.140]
you're talking about something that's been that they trained constantly

[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:49.200]
you're talking about something that it's you know it's in a paper

[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.720]
stand-rovering procedures on how to do something

[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:55.320]
and like i said i just wanted to lend you listeners know

[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:57.680]
that it's not you know a bunch of goofs

[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.760]
just standing there saying oh what's the best way to

[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.580]
but how long does it take?

[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:03.740]
how long does it take that person to create a strategy

[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:07.120]
we're not talking about the school in Colorado now we're talking about a motel

[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.780]
in a tiny motel in Los Angeles what we're talking about

[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:14.700]
sure and again i wasn't here i don't know all the

[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.320]
parameters of that case

[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:22.120]
but you know in addition to which when is something that'll be done so that the

[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:25.140]
media are prevented from showing i mean for crying out loud

[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:27.820]
they got that you've got somebody that i have to do it

[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:32.140]
the government has a nervous breakdown if i say crap on it here the FCC wants

[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:36.260]
to find us but if kknbc and all those other grey robbers want to have a

[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:39.220]
helicopter flying over showing the guy who's sitting in a hotel

[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:42.880]
from watching on television where the cops are then that's okay i guess

[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.640]
i agree with this sir

[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:44.480]
insanity

[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:48.180]
the tape there a lot to come up to the tape there a lot to go where

[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:49.800]
anywhere with the public is a lot to go

[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:50.060]
yeah

[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:55.040]
and you know it's up to their editors i guess or the people in there

[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:58.460]
and their power to determine what's going to go on the air

[01:07:58.980 --> 01:07:59.920]
it's got to stop

[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.820]
yes it is

[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:01.180]
okay

[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:02.040]
how do we get these things

[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:06.960]
five six seven oh five sixty and it reminds me that the same thing

[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.680]
and when they were doing the littleton business and of course that media feeding

[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.840]
friends he was going on their all day that day and i went home and watched it on the

[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.020]
satellite all afternoon and and they're saying oh well we're not going to show

[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:18.880]
you this side of the building and as soon as they're saying that they're showing you

[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:22.020]
that side of the building then they're saying in Atlanta well wonder they don't want us to

[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:23.140]
show the roof of the building

[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:26.100]
and while they're saying it they're showing you the roof of the building

[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:29.080]
and here's all the cops up on top of the building and while they're telling you

[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.600]
that the cops don't want them to show it

[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.760]
how many times have I told you that the people in the media are crazy

[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.500]
irresponsible grave robbers as long as they can squeeze some ratings out of it

[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.860]
they don't give a crap whose life they jeopardize they don't care

[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:43.180]
that makes it even more exciting

[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.340]
let's get to more people killed

[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.100]
here's a mobile in Miami lakes hello

[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:50.960]
hey it was up

[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:51.680]
are you doing sir

[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:55.440]
no we all got to admit that these are the last days

[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:58.540]
they said bullcrap dude good religious guy

[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.880]
how come the religious people are always the ones that say

[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:05.860]
yeah always have to bleep out bullcrap

[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:11.540]
these are the final days yes sir that's a good simplistic way to look at my dark

[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:13.320]
conflicted friend that's a brilliant way

[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:15.680]
I bet your god must have something to do with it

[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:19.260]
maybe god was pissed off at the Jews yesterday they decided

[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:22.460]
okay let's go shoot some kids you know let's not kill anybody

[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:25.380]
but let's just go shoot up a bunch of kids and here's the guy we'll use

[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:27.520]
he'll be the conduit this 40 year old punk

[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:32.420]
and by the way great job again by the media fantastic job

[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:36.700]
I get home yesterday this incident it just happened a little while before

[01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:39.180]
I got my TV going there and it's a teenager

[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:42.300]
above 17 year old teenager 5 foot 10

[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:47.500]
he's the suspect now or later it's a guy who's 5 foot 7

[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.900]
bald balding 40 years old

[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.040]
yeah you see his picture this morning

[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.900]
sure looked like some teenager to me who must still have the rough life evidently

[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.200]
huh must have done too many goddamn drugs

[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.620]
too many magic mushrooms

[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.220]
the guy is like 37 years old he could pass her 47 easy

[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:09.500]
but the first description of all is a teenager

[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:13.160]
right excellent job

[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.180]
here's plantation hello

[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.160]
plantation

[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:21.960]
Neil yes sir

[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:28.920]
well if it doesn't light up today pal I think it's lights out for everybody

[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:33.340]
you know it's it I'll tell you the NRA thing and the gun lobby is so scary

[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:36.580]
so frightening think about this for a minute I don't think anybody's brought this up

[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:41.480]
what other consumer product if there were airplanes that were malfunctioning

[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:45.300]
or food that was killing people right at seat belt so there were cars that were found

[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:48.180]
to have these things happen week after week and day after day

[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:52.100]
wouldn't it be off the market immediately wouldn't they sort of withhold

[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:56.760]
some things but the frightening thing is that we get immune to it or something

[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.800]
we take the paper up in five or dead in 11 or dead in 10 and 6

[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.160]
right after day after day

[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:04.800]
and the American public on an airplane public thanks to the way the media covers this

[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:09.440]
like it's some kind of a dock you drama instead of like some grotesque horrendous news event

[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.420]
the media just accept this like all it's like the OJ trial

[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:15.780]
oh here's another exciting thing we can spend some time with just please don't shoot us

[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:19.680]
well you know Neil knowing human behavior and the fact that I teach and I know

[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:24.700]
what makes human behavior tick the people act only in self-actualization

[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:28.500]
when it hurts you when it harms you and unfortunately it's going to take the

[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:33.280]
leadership of the NRA type people to have tragedy strike really close to home

[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:38.080]
and then something will happen the only time right and I'm not advocating going out

[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:42.400]
and picking off a few NRA members but that's when their family is

[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:45.660]
getting let's start hearing it or they totally knew that too

[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:52.960]
probably it's really frightening the powerful lobby is is totally totally scary

[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:56.340]
there's no other product that won't be pulled off the market none

[01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.040]
and I don't know what we're going to do about it

[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:03.100]
okay pal alright see you see on the big ship

[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:09.880]
5 6 7 0 5 60 0 5 60 it's the final days we don't want to get your nervous or anything like that

[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:13.460]
but our smart finicky friend had called before I think he had it right

[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:16.480]
he said it's the final freaking days

[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.140]
that's right

[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:23.860]
so you've been getting all your crap together in fact you won't need any money so

[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:26.880]
just send it all to us here at QA and you won't need that cash because when you

[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.780]
go to heaven or where it's a work or whatever you're going to be you won't need no cash

[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:33.700]
they don't take credit cards either send it all over to us we'll take it off your hands

[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:40.420]
hmm

[01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:50.160]
the era lettuce I don't know if you remember me

[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:54.680]
but I was the guy whose house you said I'd fire last you

[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.120]
God I miss you even though you blew up my car

[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:05.200]
caught all my hair off I miss you girl

[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:15.080]
but one quick question do you think you could let me know when you might let me out of this

[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:21.140]
pit no one's been here for weeks but I'm not complaining don't misunderstand me

[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:28.480]
because I loved you with all my heart but if you happen to see my mother we let it go I'm not dead yet

[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:37.940]
the era lettuce I want to tell you that the guy you saw with your best friend that wanted to be

[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:46.540]
he might have looked and talked just like me but that surely purely coincidental I was no way in near that place

[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:57.400]
I loved you too much to look at anyone else the era lettuce I had a deadish

[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:04.220]
hair and metal lips hotel I would never cheat on somebody who treats me so good

[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:08.040]
wins all those raries as all that money

[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.660]
hey come on let me out of the pit we are at the limit

[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:18.000]
it's 1.45 at 5.60 WQM 5.670 5.60 POM 5.60 on the 18T line here's a mobile in Miami

[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.740]
hello hello Neil yes sir yeah I just want to make a brief comment I work for government

[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:28.440]
maybe it's the other night stay which one I'm tired to carry a weapon in my job

[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.380]
I was listening to some of these people call in talk about how safe they are with them

[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:40.680]
I have two sons either one has any guns around their home I don't have any I wouldn't shoot a shotgun if somebody paid me

[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:47.740]
to unless I have to on my job when I get off my job I'm not on duty I call my local bank ahead of time

[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:55.240]
a range of my weapon locked up in a safety positive box I keep it separately if people thought

[01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:00.960]
the guns were so safe like you say maybe they should go to places over in Europe where nobody carries one

[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:08.280]
I'd like to be working over there where I didn't have to but I don't I just want to make a brief comment about that's why I held on so long

[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:14.820]
because buying his safe I don't have to worry about picking it up and as soon as I get home that's where it goes

[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:20.000]
and if they were all gone I wouldn't have the job thank God

[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.380]
okay just want to make that comment so you keep up the good work thanks I think

[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:24.800]
thanks a lot

[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:32.180]
okay 5 6 7 0 5 60 0 5 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line and I you know we had some calls here today

[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:36.440]
but I can see there's there's no change it doesn't make any difference you become so immune to this craft

[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:40.460]
that we can have one of these every day oh wow let's give something to do this afternoon

[01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:44.100]
it's a boring hot summer day let's go home and watch and see how many people got killed today

[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:51.420]
and we'll hear all the glory reports and then we'll go to the hospital and we'll have the hospital spokesman will come out and give us the report and hire all the glory details

[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:56.360]
and then we'll see the the SWAT team you know waiting to go in and barge in the motel and all the pictures

[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:00.280]
it's like a hobby now it's like a hobby for a neurotic country

[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:02.660]
they shoot out of the day

[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:08.860]
it's kind of just like Britain didn't outgrow that world a bullcrap this country's never outgrown a wild west mentality

[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:09.920]
and I don't think ever will

[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:15.320]
get pissed off and more somebody's crap away there you go they won't do it again

[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:21.300]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:23.640]
here's a mobile in marathon hello

[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.140]
hey Neil how are you doing today?

[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:25.720]
okay sir

[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:31.820]
going along with everything you say and I don't mean this to Soundcore and it grew up in Indiana but I believe it to be true

[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:36.400]
it starts at home and if we don't turn on the channel sevens and the nonsense news

[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:41.180]
and they don't have the ratings they don't get the revenue and revenue is what makes all this stuff happen

[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:46.660]
it starts at home with teaching our own kids and our neighbor's kids and not letting our kids go to houses that have guns

[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:51.600]
it's you know there may not be a lot you can do but I know a mother lost a baby in a drunk driving accident

[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:57.500]
and got teed off and next thing you know there's mothers against drunk drivers and the money came back to the state that said

[01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:00.400]
if you don't stop this you're not going to get the federal bucks

[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:05.540]
and until we get the legislators to step up and say okay state you ain't going to get this money

[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:09.200]
unless you're willing to compensate from that direction it probably won't change

[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:11.640]
but we can change our own house and our own neighborhood

[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:15.160]
this country has to be emancipated from the NRA

[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:20.520]
the quality of your life and everybody else's life in this country is controlled by a bunch of crazy people

[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:26.220]
called the National Rifle Association of a Stranglehold on Congress and until the day that we're emancipated from them

[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:27.640]
nothing is going to change

[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:30.220]
and have a great day

[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:36.160]
yeah and it lyric king he brings on oh yes that's his spectacle tonight tonight we got this one we got that one

[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.240]
yeah I mean talk about a shameless whore don't be just do that yeah

[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:45.120]
it brings out Jerry Spence they got to drag him out again there with his guy named Cowboy suit on

[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:49.200]
and he's on air pontificating about well television violence

[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:54.560]
you know do you think that this crazy guy that pulled this crap yesterday you think he was affected by television violence

[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:59.340]
no by goddamn video game no a lot of 40 year old guys playing video game

[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:03.000]
and if they are better called a pedophile police because that's why they're hanging around the arcade

[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:11.880]
and the guy there they with us with the stock the stock broker guy there in Atlanta you think that had to do with violence on television or in the movie no

[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:20.700]
but let's start looking for scapegoats let's dust off boring old Jerry Spence and bring his tired old ass back again there Larry nice job

[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:24.000]
don't forget the music we're listening to also

[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.740]
oh well that's definitely it no question about that

[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:32.740]
just ban all the music just make him listen to goddamn religious him is 24 hours and that'll do it

[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:43.760]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line crazy people running your lives and you're all sitting around going

[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:46.420]
like that yeah nobody cares

[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.500]
here's Boca hello yeah Neil yes sir

[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:58.440]
well the every one of these incidents with the with the schools and all the the the serial killer on the railroad track

[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:05.880]
the police have been ineffective I I can on every one of those incidents I can't think of one where the police have made a difference

[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:13.880]
they either kill themselves or like this guy escaped or they turned themselves in

[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:20.900]
well where is the police done in any any of these incidents in the past year can you think of one where the police actually jumped in there and did anything

[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:24.660]
well ok that's not a past year but Oklahoma City they got that guy pretty quick me

[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:31.480]
don't they didn't they look for a guy in in North Carolina for for months and months with everything and they never came up with him

[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:37.660]
yeah and have at the oak the bombers for the Atlanta Olympics that they ever come up with him no

[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:42.660]
yeah that's an unsanitary guy up there they didn't like him too much they weren't his life pretty good

[01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:46.740]
right that's a big guy right well they needed somebody to the game to go on yeah

[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:56.100]
but I mean of all these cases well where if the police really do that swat train in and everything but where they really captured anybody

[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:05.580]
yeah they got the people behind bars and they got the people to the swing clubs they got them out of there pretty good

[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:11.000]
you know it ok thanks for the good news sir I mean with all due respect you know they're good cops out there

[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.180]
a few of them and they do put their lives on the line very often unless they're just sitting there with a radar gun all day long

[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:21.720]
but yeah law enforcement in this country in fact I'll tell you who's doing even better job is old John Walsh on here

[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:26.680]
America's most wanted in fact that you know something that shows going to be on 24 hours a day on every network pretty soon

[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:32.280]
America's most wanted you're going to be spending all your time all your spare moments around work and school and

[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:37.900]
whatever else you want to do you're going to be spending all your time calling up John Walsh and those people because they're going to be so many

[01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:43.160]
guy damn people killing everybody oh there he is we just walked down the street there's another one let's go get him

[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:50.300]
good job by the FBI and that command and business to it that was really good huh all those leaflets they pretended they handed

[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:56.160]
off that nobody ever saw down here which is picture should have been on the front page of the guy named Harold and that pawn shop slip

[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:03.480]
that was sitting there for two or three weeks into Miami Beach Police Department that had his motel address on it and his name and passport number

[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:11.080]
excellent job but let's go out there and read the swing clubs all by the way there is one good piece of news where the hell is it

[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:18.060]
at least temporarily private club gets temporary reprieve injunction issued in response to suit a judge

[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:24.760]
is ordered police to take a hiatus from arresting members of a private club in Fort Lauderdale where people dance partly naked and enjoy

[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:32.580]
obscene language oh my god they're enjoying obscene language in a private club well f them it's just a temporary reprieve

[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:37.660]
for the catch me out to a members only club whose attorney say it shouldn't be governed by laws meant for public

[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:47.020]
adult establishments and it goes on and on and Fort Lauderdale police detective Jim Wright says this has been going on for decades

[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:55.660]
the city has been defending and changing its strip club laws for years yeah because these are the kind of important things that we need to really clamp down on not

[01:21:55.660 --> 01:22:02.880]
catching people with guns crazy people murderers we don't need to worry about that we need to worry about what consenting adults are doing in private clubs and

[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:10.460]
behind closed doors that's what we need to be concerned about the pleasure police not the crazy lunatics we can't catch them like the guy says

[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:19.720]
and he's right five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eighteen t line we got a couple lines open here this public isn't there

[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:25.300]
they're not whipped up to a frenzy they don't give a crap they're used to it here's coral springs hello

[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:37.320]
hey Neil how you doing okay sir Greg just moved back down here from gamesville back down the coral springs I just started listening to your show we don't get it up there I appreciate I'm enjoying it so far

[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:47.280]
basically the most I know about the law what I see on TV on the on the movies but you know what I personally think is and I would like to hear your

[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:56.180]
standpoint on it is you know by the time you're able to run all the the get information from get a run up by the mayor got to get it this by the time you know they get

[01:22:56.180 --> 01:23:03.200]
everything approved seems like a 30 done it's already over with them by that time it's too late what do you think that's any got you run up by the mayor

[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:11.280]
we know the guys in there we know he's doing this we did we need a search war we know he's got this going on he's selling guns out of there but you know we can't

[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:18.240]
just go in the house and arrest them because we know he's doing it we got to run all this stuff out yeah like what do you think about that and they never stopped him from

[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:24.220]
you know breaking down the doors very often by the way in the wrong house never stopped and before breaking the doors down the way they thought there were

[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:32.220]
drugs being the right right right right honestly I agree with you 100% why why can't we just do that like how many years ago was it when

[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:38.360]
when you were able to just go in house you know something's wrong and then you can go take care of it you have to run it by a mayor

[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:46.700]
by by all the people all the judicial people I mean what kind of that's ridiculous that's it that's yondo they probably had to call Tom Bo that before they could

[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:55.800]
get you know permission to go into motel last night I don't I don't I just don't believe that I mean I think it's ridiculous but I appreciate it I'm enjoying your

[01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:04.360]
shit on keep going okay great thanks thanks anything five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line here's

[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:30.920]

[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:35.920]
outfit that's the only thing he's got to wear listen me I agree with you heart of sound of you know banning the gun shows but you know

[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:42.200]
unfortunately it seems like it's cast out of the bag you know it's like 200 million guns floating around what do you do about that I

[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:47.840]
it's just it's like banging your head against the well I'm not saying we're going to solve the problem you're right the horses way out of the

[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:54.940]
bomb but at least you at least you make an effort at least you start somewhere yeah yeah it's just it's really and especially that he's a

[01:24:54.940 --> 01:25:02.140]
salt weapons why should any why does any citizen in this country need to own an assault weapon I can tell you why because you may have to kill 30

[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:10.660]

[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:32.120]
totally insensitive to it yeah he's in high alias so he's lost all of his sensitivity I guess right

[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:37.960]
you know I like to make a comment in regards to that um I don't know if you heard it but just to the

[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:44.080]
relaunches of the kid 14 year old I had read that story the right at the beginning of the show today sir

[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:52.120]
is that playing with playing with a 22 caliber rifle right and um it just goes to show that you you mentioned it earlier I

[01:35:52.120 --> 01:36:00.220]
don't know what it is we're going to do all or what is going to take what they just got to flat out outlaw firearms

[01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:07.180]
right I'm with you I'm an extremist when it comes to gun control I don't want to see any citizens walking around with guns there

[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:12.260]
isn't anybody I mean you know people depending on their job if they're like with a DEA or something like that but I mean

[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:18.140]
oh that's a bad example though but people who need a gun are most seriously but unless it has something to do with a

[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:23.360]
life in that situation with the occupation right no citizens ought to be walking around with a gun and if they can't

[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:29.120]
give a I don't care what you say there is almost nobody in this country who is killing a game in order to survive

[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:34.520]
you know in order to make their dinner that night at the bunch of bullcrap exactly well so I just want to let you know

[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:40.480]
that I'm the hand you agree with you 100% and as far as all of these sick goals who want to bash their rod is

[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:45.760]
because he's got the frick the flipping balls is stand up for something that's right screw you all

[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:08.300]

[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:14.040]
yeah I feel like that caller from highly I want to make a comment on that and I he was a genius he was a rocket scientist

[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:18.280]
oh man I move away from highly of take a bit get away from people like that

[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:25.720]
so one of the responsibilities of the media is that not allow it to be shown so much to de-centralize people like that

[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:29.500]
and I can't think for themselves yeah but you don't understand I mean they got 24 hours

[01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:34.500]
of data for love now we have all these 24 hour news channels and so as a result they're just waiting for something like this

[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:37.200]
I wouldn't be surprised if maybe they're involved in it sometimes you know

[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:41.440]
yeah they plotted or something they make it happen they're probably getting Bernie charmer to go you know

[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:44.480]
they're probably like got him locked into a room somewhere and trying to make him a crazy

[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:50.060]
and going to give him a couple of oozes and see what he can do right well they're there before the cops do it and I wouldn't doubt it

[01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:56.460]
the cops get there I wouldn't doubt it or one last thing oh well no that's pretty much it you keep doing a good job

[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:16.900]
from these criminals they don't go after them if it's a guy show a pot or something they got 20 cops they don't try to

[01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:24.440]
set the guy up and then do a reverse thing and all that but a guy that they said this guy had a a soul charge with a deadly weapon

[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:32.440]
yeah and he was looking to do eight months they don't say nobody looking for this guy you know I mean if he was a drug dealer I'm just saying nobody looking for him

[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:41.320]
well they he was on probation right and they was supposed to go to jail for eight months and he didn't show up and you know why didn't they pick him up then

[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:36.380]
body and we can you know the biggest joke in the world victim of crimes and that's where they spend 90% of their time you know the police trying to

[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:43.580]
get more people were generating a lot of money yeah well thank god the cops aren't running no prostitution ring I'm sorry forgot about that

I just heard something maybe you can help me out with it yes sir the guy goes in and shoots over 70 shots and shoots those poor kids over a hundred yeah they may be calling it a hate crime as opposed to what

[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:14.520]
as opposed to a regular old run of the mill garden variety crime in other words that's why that whole thing about hate crime is so idiotic it's so stupid I mean what difference is it make what you call it a crime is a crime let's start

[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:23.560]
prosecuting people and put them away for a long time what if it doesn't make what you call it if I'm in other words I'm not a Nazi so if I wouldn't did that then it would have been less heinous

[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:32.240]
less heinous well anyway I look forward to the Marlon's yeah but you are please okay

[01:44:50.200 --> 01:45:00.360]
uh-huh for the only people who are going to have guns are the decisions criminals yeah that's it and and our civilians going to protect

[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:08.480]
ourselves if some criminal breaks into a house tonight with a gun and rob this how many people do you know to get to that protect themselves

[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:14.860]
because they have a gun in their homes how many of you read about three well no my father has a gun so many have to chase them when I have a house with it

[01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:25.360]

[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:45.100]
man it's been dynamite Joe Angel bottom of the seventh last night all right and lots more that to come in just a couple of minutes

[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:10.980]
anthems off and I'm glad to be back here listening to you because you're ready up there stock really blows yeah yeah okay but I got a little

[01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:18.800]
maybe a little solution to this gun control business they're always good drinking a lot of that any freeze when it's real cold up there in Northern Michigan

[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:26.880]
you know oh yeah I don't do it every time yeah you can have some more money inside yeah right yeah okay but look here if some of that

[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:34.700]
antsy freeze let them let them sell all the guns they want yeah but if they didn't have no bullets for the guns

[01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:43.840]
there you go that's right guns don't kill people bullets do there you go don't kill people bullets do let's give everybody

[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:55.040]
all the guns you want just know more bullets here's Miami hello oh Neil yes sir okay I can understand lots of bows just no arrows yes sir

[01:46:55.780 --> 01:47:13.540]
I can understand you being an extremist however we both know that being an extremist on any issue is sometimes self-defeating yeah let me

[01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:20.420]
take care of it but I'm just not an extremist on just about any issue yeah well I'm usually not either but in this case see I feel like if you take an extreme

[01:47:20.420 --> 01:47:25.260]
position then maybe you might like to take make a little progress because if you just take a middle of the road position they've been

[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:36.280]
tried to bet forever and not anything happens I understand that and I can agree with you on many sides about that but let's try this everybody that once

[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:44.780]
absolutely no guns and anybody's hand yeah I think they should have should should have two signs made up one for their home that says

[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:52.820]
absolutely no guns in this home and one for their automobile that says the driver carries no guns whatsoever yeah

[01:47:52.820 --> 01:48:03.280]
with those in both places for a beer and see if that changes people's minds meaning what well who do you think

[01:48:03.380 --> 01:48:10.340]
how does anybody who's going to break into your home know if you have a weapon or not how do they know exactly they don't so so then what's the point

[01:48:10.340 --> 01:48:16.360]
so let's put a sign up so how do they know how do they know that you do have one if they're going to think about breaking into your house sir do

[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:20.840]
those people have a sign that says warning we got all kinds of ammunition in here in hand grenades etc.

[01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:33.360]
You're right I never saw house like that sir ha ha ha ha ha yeah great material idiot moron jackass simpleton oh he's not an NRA guy no I'm not sure

[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:41.120]

[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:48.260]

[01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:50.940]
hey listen to marlins baby that's where the big money is you believe it
