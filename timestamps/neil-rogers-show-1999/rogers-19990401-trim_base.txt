[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.540]
Sport Radio 560, WQAM, Miami-Ford Lauderdale presents the Neil Roger Hume to talk to Neil

[00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.880]
called 567-0560, called free for need and rarer, or count 560 on your cell phone.

[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.600]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers, or anyone else on the show to not necessarily

[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.500]
reflect those of WQAM easily read acquisitions or the easily broadcast group.

[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.620]
Now, Neil Rogers on Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.840]
Playoff, sir? Playoff, this.

[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.260]
Ooooo!

[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.340]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.280]
Oh, wow!

[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.100]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.520]
It puts them both together.

[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.760]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.280]
When the eyeball falls out, it puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.020]
Then it has to hose it out.

[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.560]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.360]
But I have to get it.

[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.160]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.880]
It needs to rub it on my brush.

[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.720]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.120]
I have to try and clean my skin so it puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.960]
I said, oh, wow!

[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.380]
I switched my TV.

[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.940]
It's my legs, I said, oh, wow!

[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.100]
I like to dance around his waist.

[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.460]
Oh, please!

[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.460]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.480]
Oh, wow!

[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.780]
I want to look more like a wolf.

[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.380]
My name is Pablo Bill.

[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.740]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.380]
It makes it more like a...

[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.440]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.640]
I hold my PPE.

[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.240]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.660]
How much does it grow?

[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.640]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.000]
I've got my skin so nibbling like this.

[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.060]
Now, let me give one thing to you.

[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.000]
I thought this was the sports car with the microphone.

[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.780]
It was supposed to be the sports station.

[00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.720]
Now, let me give you this.

[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.660]
See, because this April 1st, maybe I'm just getting old.

[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.480]
You know, maybe I'm a real sour bad guy.

[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.780]
But all this April full stuff to me is like maybe for five-year-old kids.

[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.560]
You know, there's a spider on your ass.

[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.340]
I'll April full.

[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.200]
There's a tarantula crawling on your right hand.

[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.060]
It's on April full.

[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.740]
You know, that's tough.

[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.100]
Is there anybody in this audience that really believes this crap that just went on here?

[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.380]
I'm driving to work this morning.

[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.500]
And I'm mainly turning into listen because I want to hear because I did read my newspaper this morning.

[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.360]
And the people over there, some of the doctors and the Panther organization,

[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.720]
they're all bent out of shape.

[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.100]
And of course, we saw last night the, you know, the final nails in a coffin, just a disaster,

[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.860]
which I have tons to say about this organization.

[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.600]
So I'm listening, and you know, Joe is continuing to tell it like it is about the doctoratearian and what he thinks.

[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.940]
You know, we don't know, which I'll straighten that out by the way in a few minutes,

[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.120]
because there's nothing that I said that even comes close to slander or liable doctor.

[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.600]
But just like everybody else in the organization, they just can't handle it.

[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.500]
They can't handle the heat.

[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.980]
And then I'm listening to this, you know, this thing that comes on it was so ridiculous on the face of it.

[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.660]
And even I'm thinking, you know, is this possibly true?

[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.540]
Not that I care.

[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.900]
I don't really give a crap if it often go get a cold in the draft.

[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.700]
I don't give a crap.

[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.600]
What do I care?

[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.760]
And then I come in here this morning and I found out that this whole thing that people around there,

[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.280]
and they're like, hey, hey, hold on, everybody's looked up and we're friends.

[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.260]
Let's say we were the news station.

[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.160]
And it was the 1st of April, okay, just listen to this.

[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.900]
Let's say we wanted to pull an April fool on the audience a news station.

[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.160]
And we came on the year and we said, there is poison in the water supply.

[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.540]
Oh my God.

[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.760]
All over South Florida.

[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.100]
And if you've had any tap water in the last, you know, 24 hours, you're going to die.

[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.600]
Or they're dropping nuclear weapons on Philadelphia as we speak.

[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.260]
The Russians are pissed off about Kosovo.

[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.700]
They're dropping nuclear weapons.

[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.080]
There are missiles on the way headed or Castro just had a volumetric or something that would really get people psychotic.

[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.940]
Do you think we'd have any credibility left?

[00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.360]
No.

[00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.800]
No.

[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.900]
Now, do you, let me ask you, is it me?

[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.160]
Because I got a pretty good sense of humor.

[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.640]
I find humor in almost anything.

[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.820]
Do you find that this exercise that just went on here for last couple hours?

[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.520]
Do you find that amusing?

[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360]
No, but I don't care.

[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.040]
No, I don't care either.

[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.480]
They're just sucking in a bunch of sports types who cares about them.

[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.120]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.660]
That's a good point.

[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.240]
They deserve it.

[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.000]
And this guy, oh, I bet $300 is about Kosovo.

[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.520]
Yeah.

[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.680]
Good.

[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.760]
You deserve it, asshole.

[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.220]
That'll teach you.

[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.040]
Don't believe anything you hear on this radio station.

[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.040]
There you go.

[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.320]
There's all a bunch of crap.

[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.640]
I think that's the message.

[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.560]
Maybe we ought to have a big billboard campaign, which we'll never have that, but that would be a good idea.

[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.040]
If you hear it on QAM, you know it's a pile of crap.

[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.480]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.360]
That could be our slogan.

[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.580]
The crap station.

[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.660]
Life is a bunch of crap.

[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.540]
So why the hell are you out of us?

[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.820]
I just, I don't know whether to laugh or read a banana, okay?

[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.480]
Another April fool.

[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.440]
I can think about what?

[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.380]
What did I tell you right before the show?

[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.920]
What?

[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.000]
Is it true?

[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.920]
What can you tell me about the...

[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.360]
No, actually, they created Dan Moreno for two bags of sporting equipment.

[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.060]
A couple of jocks, draps, and a partridge and a pear tree.

[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.080]
And Danny Bonadoos back.

[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.880]
How to help me know when you hear it on your sports station, you're supposed to believe it's true, right?

[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.120]
Even as ridiculous as it sounds.

[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.260]
You know, just Richmond, Webb, and Kareem Abdul Jibar for a draft pick, which may or may not be this one or Edgerman or that one.

[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.440]
Let me just ludicrous.

[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.760]
But nevertheless, this is where these sports nerds tune in to get their information.

[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.760]
And there are people running to their computer and they're looking it up and they're betting and they're calling people all around the country.

[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.520]
And they can't find it any other yada yada.

[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.900]
April Fool!

[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.060]
Yeah!

[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.880]
I am just astonished.

[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.340]
But anyway, happy paysock to you.

[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.220]
Happy Easter.

[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.440]
Happy Good Friday tomorrow.

[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.000]
Oh, what's that? Another new one?

[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.480]
Boy, now we've got a fellow you already had this one 104.

[00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.260]
No, I do not.

[00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.740]
Okay, good.

[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.600]
Like I said, it's another new one.

[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.440]
Let's get that right on.

[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.940]
Immediately.

[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.780]
It's not sooner.

[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.280]
But anyway, just...

[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.920]
I'm just shocked.

[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.100]
I'm also...

[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.240]
Oh, by the way, here's how before we get into the Panther stuff,

[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.640]
and Dr. Raterian and the Cleveland Clinic and all these other experts,

[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.340]
here's today's letter.

[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.540]
Here are incipit letter to the editor of the day.

[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.100]
And of course, it comes from our favorite newspaper that my my hero...

[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.500]
OOHH!

[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.660]
The heading, they put Castro's baseball jinks.

[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.120]
By the way, thank goodness we don't have any people who are superstitious down here in South Florida.

[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.680]
OOHH!

[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.660]
Well, we got all kinds of...

[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.880]
We got the old youth that put mizzizzes on the doorframe.

[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.580]
We got Cubans that buy magnetic bracelets.

[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.640]
And I look out the window for the two per copper and whatever else.

[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.580]
The letter from Angel Suarez in Miami says...

[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.160]
Poor Baltimore Orioles fans by shaking fiddle Castro's bloody hands,

[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.580]
odor-honor-Peter Angelo's received Castro's jinks.

[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.200]
The Orioles will never win a World Series as long as Mr. Angelo's is the owner.

[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.900]
End of letter.

[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.360]
There you go, boys and girls.

[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.960]
OOHH!

[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.260]
Today's incipit letter to the editor of the day.

[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.440]
The Castro jinks.

[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.180]
He shook the bearded ones hand,

[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.660]
and now the Orioles are cursed from the nodulean to time.

[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.580]
Do you believe it?

[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:08.340]
Yes, good.

[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.300]
It's getting back to it last night.

[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.900]
Do we have to get back to this whole business, this Pogbael Buré business?

[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.620]
See, it's not just a Pogbael Buré business, it's stuff I've been telling you for a very, very long time.

[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.860]
For six years now, but I'm a bad guy.

[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.960]
Most people don't want to believe me.

[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.840]
Before I even get into anything about the organization, let me just tell you this.

[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.220]
We get there to the game, usual time last night about 6.15, 6.20, I walk in and the arena

[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.440]
the inside is almost dark, very few lights are on.

[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.360]
I said to the Usher, I joke that it is Wayne cutting back on electricity now, we tried

[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.080]
to conserve gas, it just laughed, and it was fenced over in there.

[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.520]
I look around and there is maybe three other people in the joint.

[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.400]
Now I will say by the time the game got underway, we got well in the first period that the crowd

[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.800]
they had improved and filled in, there were maybe a couple thousand in T.C. but at one point

[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.320]
it looked like nobody was going to be there.

[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.200]
And as I started looking around in my section and the section to my right one thirty-four,

[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.380]
I am looking around and I said where the hell is everybody I know?

[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.240]
There may have been 50 people in the arena last night who are usually where they are.

[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.440]
Because when you are going to have a sporting event in sunrise, not pay saw.

[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.380]
See it is a matter of priorities.

[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:19.780]
Isn't that pathetic?

[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.900]
It is a matter of priorities.

[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.920]
Well what do they schedule the game for anyway on pay saw?

[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.300]
Because they figured you could have your damn satire after the game or something, okay?

[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.700]
In fact it would have been the last supper after that game believe me.

[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.640]
For everybody.

[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.900]
I don't get it.

[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.380]
I mean sitting around drinking wine and having matsu is more important than coming and supporting

[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.000]
the panthers.

[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.540]
Even though they stink.

[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.520]
Oh God.

[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.640]
I am sorry.

[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.960]
I want to apologize on behalf of all the Jews who have come to the panther games.

[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.740]
I want to apologize to the team that except for a few of us, nobody else bothered to show

[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.040]
up because it was more important to sit around eating cardboard with the butter and salt

[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:03.900]
on it and dipping their parsley in the salt water and oozing some horse radish on each

[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.640]
other's back though whatever they were doing last night.

[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.480]
I'm sorry.

[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.880]
I know people like to sit around with a family and they like to have the mogen David but

[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.500]
come on.

[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.840]
At a time when we needed your support we needed you to be there.

[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.940]
And by the way some of the boso's you gave your tickets to who were standing around in

[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.900]
the eyes looking standing in front of us while we were trying to watch the game while

[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.380]
the game was going on and people are finally screaming sit on already you jackass.

[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.160]
But anyway.

[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.060]
Hey life goes on.

[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.220]
You know maybe life is just a big April fool.

[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.520]
Maybe I'm not even here today.

[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.280]
Maybe this is on tape April fool.

[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:41.960]
Ten.

[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.560]
I still can't go to I don't think I'll ever recover from this so whole and we're on the

[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.960]
we're like only a matter of yards away from that room.

[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.340]
Why does that surprise you?

[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:49.720]
It doesn't.

[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.400]
You're right because I'm old and naive.

[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:51.960]
Okay.

[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.400]
Who's being naive now?

[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.060]
Okay.

[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.780]
That's with a Q and a C H. Okay.

[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.180]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 in a mobile one line.

[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.440]
We got lots to say today about that whole organization.

[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.440]
This whole doctor bit and that's it.

[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:04.380]
Oh.

[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:04.900]
Yes.

[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:05.420]
Push.

[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.180]
I'm the.

[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.700]
She has no idea.

[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:19.560]
We're.

[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.720]
I see clear.

[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:26.920]
I'm.

[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.440]
I'm.

[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:29.340]
I'm.

[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:29.340]

[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:29.340]

[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:29.340]

[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:29.380]
I'm.

[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:29.380]

[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:29.380]

[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.140]
I'm.

[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:31.920]
I'm.

[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.520]
I'm.

[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:33.520]

[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:33.520]

[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:33.520]

[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:33.520]

[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.440]
I'm.

[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.740]
I'm.

[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.560]
I'm.

[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.760]
I'm.

[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:52.480]

[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.920]
I'm.

[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.540]
I'm.

[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.060]
I'm.

[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.500]
I'm.

[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.640]
I'm.

[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.760]
The.

[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:17.300]
I'm.

[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.640]
We got the rules, we got the rules

[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:28.700]
Maybe sexy, tech, jet, travel, bounce, and still just think that Joker's up for you

[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.460]
See how the heave like you're back, somebody's with his eyes

[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.920]
I'm rising, Joker's in the rough dance

[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.780]
Channing up the same floor, I

[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.500]
Let me bounce the potion, he won't be a grown shoe

[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.780]
I'm about to see a tear about the ball I do

[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.900]
Press it, press man, I am a stressed man

[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.960]
I need a ball, rush, come at the blue, come at the blue

[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.660]
I'm about to see a tear about the ball

[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:10.680]
I'm about to see a tear about the ball

[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:20.620]
15 and 5, 60 WQM, they support nerds, I guess maybe they deserve what they got this morning because the zords is getting all these calls out to you

[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.500]
I think those idiots deserve it

[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.100]
They're not going to listen to what I'm saying because God forbid they should listen to the Neil Ranger show

[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:31.700]
Even though very often you get the right information from this show as opposed to the other 20 hours with the sports experts

[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.640]
Nobody wanted to believe the thing about Jimmy Johnson and Dave Wands

[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.580]
The way that whole thing went down with Wayne, they don't want to believe that

[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.380]
Just like they don't want to believe that the day that Burray got injured in the Colorado game

[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.700]
That all over the rest of the NHL, they were reporting he's out for the year

[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.680]
And here we were getting stroked and let down

[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.780]
Oh he's going to be fine and butt-a-bid, but I'm open all this other stuff, all these things

[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.780]
So let me start at the beginning by the way as far as the Burray situation is concerned

[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.600]
I read my hero this morning in David J. Neil and by the way David

[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.200]
I was sitting right there with my leaf jacket on and I was at the game last night

[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.160]
If anybody would have wanted to talk to me it would have been very easy, I was right there

[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.600]
But nobody came by and asked me for any quotes about this story about Dr. Riterian at the Cleveland Clinic

[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.360]
The Panthers orthopedic surgeon

[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.760]
See I'm going to tell you exactly what I said

[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.800]
I said that I heard Joe on the morning show talking a couple of days ago about the fact that you really have to wonder

[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.760]
You see Gordon Murphy out for so long and Dino with his back unable to come back

[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.280]
And then the Burray thing getting worse and worse and then they have to send him to Alabama

[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.520]
To the top ACL guy in the universe to do the surgery

[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.080]
And you start wondering about maybe the quality of the medical care they're getting at the Cleveland Clinic

[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.460]
Since they are the physicians for the Panthers

[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.140]
I agree with that and then I went into the thing about my own personal experiences there

[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.720]
And I told exactly the way they were, exactly

[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.660]
One good experience with the asshole doctor there

[00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.540]
Where they brought the whole bunch of guys in with a hemorrhoid thing

[00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.100]
They said fine, just you know you'll be okay and I was

[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.380]
They were great

[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.760]
The other four experiences I've had there, I'm real unhappy with

[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.460]
And I'm still unhappy today in spite of what Dr. Riterian Rady buddy else says

[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.940]
I went to him with my foot

[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:15.940]
I had the plantar fascia, what about I think it's a heelspur

[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.420]
You remember that for months

[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.740]
Thanks to the other quack who wasn't at that clinic by the way, the quack

[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.360]
With the magnets, the asshole doctor

[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.920]
Which I'm not going to put his name on here

[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.000]
Because guess what, I don't slander people on here

[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.720]
Doctor, I've been doing this a long time and it may first day in a business

[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.940]
I love that some of the statements were bordering on the libel

[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.240]
Yeah, he's very upset

[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:43.860]
The this has been popular topic for the past two days and WQM is the first team in the Mee Aradja show

[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.340]
So it says in David J. Schwo's article in the Herald this morning

[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.420]
I'm real unhappy with the quality of care, they look in a smear that I got

[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.300]
And Dr. Riterian, he was very nice to me like I said when I was there

[00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:01.160]
They took a little extra in my foot, the the bone spur was so small that barely even showed up on the x-ray

[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.380]
And he showed me you know you stand in front of the wall and you slide your foot

[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.760]
Didn't do me any good, you know

[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:13.880]
I mean I slid that foot, I stood in front of the wall and you know looking at the wall with my thing in my hand and sliding it in the foot too

[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.060]
And then months later slowly but surely thank God, thank God

[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.960]
That's the adanthing one away, the heel spur

[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:27.720]
And the other experiences I've had with other doctors or doctor at that place have been very unsatisfactory

[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.320]
Which I've been telling you and I don't apologize for that and it's not slanderous, it's a fact

[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.860]
It's not even just my opinion, it's a fact

[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.880]
I haven't made up any of the reactions I've had to take into much of the hydrochlorothymus

[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.700]
I've got to blood test results to prove it

[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.220]
I have no reason here, you know when you go to a doctor you're not going looking for a problem

[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.360]
You're going to look and usually solve a problem

[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.360]
Not looking to create a problem

[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:59.100]
But it's interesting that the whole response to everything that's being said now is typical

[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.160]
It's part and parcel of the Panther organization

[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:07.040]
This is the sixth year and one thing I'll say for them even though we've had a change in faces there

[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.120]
We had Bobbi Clark and we've had all the different coaches

[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.580]
Now we've got BM and TM, Bill Torrey has been here the whole lot was his both times

[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.900]
Doesn't make any difference to the faces are because it's still a hard-ass organization

[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.600]
They don't like the truth, they don't like criticism

[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.420]
Remember last year with Brian Murray show in the morning guys

[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.580]
We had Christine and Mara come in there and Jeldie to hold everybody's hand and screen the calls

[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.080]
Because they can't take any criticism

[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.200]
And then they turn around and they admit they've been lying to the public

[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.300]
That's the best part

[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:41.820]
They can't figure out why everybody's conjecturing and second guessing about Burray was his knee bad when he got here

[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.720]
Did Dr. Aterin do the right thing?

[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.380]
Yada yada, and somebody factures me the article by Greg Stoda in the Palm Beach post

[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.360]
Which I'm not going to repeat on the year because that would be like publishing it again

[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.520]
And I know what it's all about

[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.520]
I've been around the block with these things

[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.360]
So I'm not going to read this thing on the year

[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.460]
So the thing is Sue Mayas for repeating something

[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.300]
Which I have no idea where Greg Stoda got his information

[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.800]
The headline of which says Burray bots puts stupidity on new level

[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.540]
I don't know

[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:13.360]
And just like I said the other day I have no idea what condition Pavel Burray's knee was when he got here

[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.240]
Any more than any of you do by the way

[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:22.840]
Or the level of competence I mean Dr. Aterin by all accounts is outstanding

[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.620]
Great orthopedic surgeon

[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.080]
But as far as what he did with Pavel Burray, do I know anything about it?

[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:29.480]
No

[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.740]
So I'm not going to sit here and conjecture

[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.120]
All I'm going to do is tell you my honest opinions that I have doubts about the whole thing

[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.800]
Where the healthcare that maybe some of these guys are getting or maybe they're just very unlucky this team

[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.760]
But let me say it again Mr. B.M.

[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.620]
Because you keep sticking your foot in your mouth over and over and over again

[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.920]
And you bet this is the luckiest organization in the world

[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.480]
I have never seen a bunch of people fall into such a bucket of crap

[00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:01.220]
After two incredibly lackluster years with thousands of people missing in the stands game after game

[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.680]
Couldn't give tickets away and then they got hot for a couple of months that third year

[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.080]
They go to the Stanley Cup finals

[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.460]
Everybody's running around town

[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.720]
We love you Pavel

[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.940]
Yeah, we there you go

[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.300]
Come on Joe, let's hear it

[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.600]
Everybody's in a frenzy here

[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.520]
Everybody's got the flag spun out the windows

[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.560]
The whole town is up whipped up into a frenzy

[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.840]
It was an exciting great time

[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.780]
Now after being threatened we're going to lose the team by the way

[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.300]
Guess what?

[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.320]
Hey, we found a way to take public money

[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:28.900]
Guess what?

[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.920]
They built the air Canada Center in Toronto $177 million

[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.520]
Everybody tells me a beautiful facility

[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.960]
I've only seen the outside so far

[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.480]
It is beautiful outside

[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.200]
$177 million was one penny of it

[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.120]
Public money

[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:42.440]
No

[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.260]
All private money

[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.180]
So Wayne gets himself a $200 million or arena up there in sunrise

[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:49.820]
Great location

[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.960]
Most of the sports fans

[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.760]
And I hate to break the news to you, Mad Dogger

[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.160]
I love you, Mad Dog, but you're full of crap on the baseball stadium

[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.320]
I'm biscuit and pull of art

[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.200]
Most of the sports fans at the sporting event in this town

[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.760]
Come from Broward and Palm Beach

[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.120]
Okay?

[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.800]
Hate to break the news to you on that

[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.260]
So at any rate we go through all of this

[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.240]
You get to end and then not only that

[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.920]
But because of the euphoria, the enthusiasm

[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.360]
From that third year go to the Stanley Cup finals

[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.260]
They practically sell the joint out

[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.260]
We got Pat Krauss 1819000 night after night

[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.140]
In spite of the mediocre play

[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.200]
In spite of the fact that up until Pavel Buray

[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.100]
We have strictly a mediocre team out there

[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.720]
With one or two guys that put out all the time

[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.560]
And a bunch of floaters out there all the time

[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.460]
Unbelieveable walking

[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.500]
And then Buray comes in and he's just unbelievable

[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.420]
He's scoring and he's making shots that haven't been invented yet

[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.420]
Everybody's on a fire excited about it

[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.800]
He gets into the first time

[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.260]
He gets into the second time

[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.280]
Well, you know, they're going to do another ACL

[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.620]
He'll be back in a few days

[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.060]
He's scathing, he's practicing

[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.720]
We're waiting to see, you know, he'll be back

[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.080]
He'll be out a few days

[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.920]
All over the rest of the league they're saying

[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.420]
Oh no, he's not going to be back

[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.160]
He's out for the year

[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.640]
It's a lot worse than they're admitting

[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.780]
And then Brian Murray would add brilliant comments the other day

[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.280]
Oh well, you know, we had to say that

[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.820]
Because if he could possibly come back even 80 or 90 percent

[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.320]
We didn't want the rest of the league to play

[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.400]
As no one had a problem

[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.740]
Because then they'd be a gut inform

[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.920]
And go in after the knee and the audio-addio-addio

[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.500]
So now is there anybody who can believe they've totally blown up their own credibility

[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.660]
Is if they had any in the first place they have none

[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.940]
They don't have any credibility

[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.980]
These are people who are incapable of just coming forward and leveling with the public

[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.200]
They just can't do it

[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.100]
The whole organization

[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.620]
And they hate me like poison

[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:33.740]
They're pissed off his health

[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.420]
Because they don't like guys that go on a year and tell it the way it is

[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.060]
You know, I'm the only one

[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.360]
There isn't one of the rest of you who gives a crap about this

[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.600]
Maybe maybe five of you

[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.340]
Maybe the other five hockey fans

[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.280]
Not just the people of bodies in the seats

[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.140]
All year long I've been screaming about the fact you can't see the goal light when a goal is scored

[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.680]
Last night here we got all these strangers in there

[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.300]
Most people, you know, who knows who these people are in the seats

[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.120]
Because everybody else is eating maca

[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.340]
The second path to goal at that end

[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.160]
Right after the borac, then by the way you're playing good right at good, right?

[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:06.760]
God bless you

[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.780]
There's one kid playing good. He's really giving it all

[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.000]
He goes behind a net and waits for the islander goal tender

[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.160]
He don't have the post cover

[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.260]
So the borac comes off to the side of the goal and he shoots it off the back of his pad

[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.000]
The goal is bad

[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.520]
And plop the puck is sitting there in the net

[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.080]
Now I want to tell you you could have sang the National Anthem

[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:30.180]
Oh Canada and done your Monastery in Halala has four times before all of us stood up

[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.900]
It's a lot better with any reaction

[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.500]
I could see the puck sitting there in the net

[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.000]
But again because of the fact there's no red light on

[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.440]
I mean it just happened so fast there was so quirky and bizarre

[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.920]
There's just the sounds of silence in the macarena

[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:48.060]
That's why the fans have to be able to see the goal light when a goal is scored

[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:52.720]
And the fact that the organization still doesn't care enough to get things fixed

[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.740]
So they work right in that place, that's what makes me positive

[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.340]
They don't give a crap about the fans

[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:03.660]
And that's what makes me continue to wonder if they weren't stroking people along with his Pavel Burry crap

[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.520]
Just at the time when people were supposed to be sending their playoff money

[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:14.980]
I was poo-pooing that the other day but now I'm just playing poo-pooing period all over the place

[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.520]
Because your organization has no credibility with me, okay?

[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.080]
Mr. BM and TM and all you other fakers out there?

[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.140]
No credibility

[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:27.940]
I mean when you come right out and you admit to the people you've been lying to them

[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.080]
Oh well you had to say this and you had to cover up that

[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.660]
No matter what you're saying, I was going to be just like the worst thing

[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.160]
If the dolphins pull off some trade tomorrow

[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.800]
And the worst team comes on the year and announces it is anybody going to believe it?

[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:39.920]
No

[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.040]
Pat the audience will say, oh gee this must be an April a second joke

[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:46.620]
Man

[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.600]
Don't screw with people's credibility, that's what I say

[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:54.520]
If your credibility isn't important to you, what does that say?

[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.500]
Doesn't that tell you everything you need to know?

[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:56.920]
Uh-huh

[00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.600]
Oh by the way they're dropping nuclear weapons on Geneva, New York

[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.120]
Just face and stand for nothing

[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.380]
In his courtroom, everyone has the right to a fair trial

[00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:11.020]
But if they're proven wrong, he has the right to make them get down

[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.840]
Judge James Brown

[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.320]
Judge, this is a matter of Adams versus Smith

[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.720]
Thank you Mr. Hollett

[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.540]
Now they're missed Adam, you did a minute bit, so they wanted it

[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.000]
Uh, yes that's right, Your Honor

[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.880]
And oh, Mr. Adam what we said about it

[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.380]
Oh, in the wallet, $200 in cash and all my credit cards

[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.180]
Ah, good God

[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.060]
Uh-huh, now look at that, Mrs. Smith, did you get it there?

[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.760]
Yes Your Honor, I did take this wallet but it's already because of you

[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.400]
Stop it now, what you just take them out, what's wrong?

[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.320]
I guess I don't really know your honor

[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.740]
Well now Judge James Brown say, you don't know better than that, it's about you

[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.720]
I don't know, all I can say is I'm sorry

[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.760]
Uh-huh, now Judge James, it's a problem, it's his own problem

[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.760]
You get the man back to money, give him a better water, judgment, photo, play it

[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.860]
And this Judge, it's gonna sentence the movie you, you know what I'm doing?

[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.080]
Get the whole nut, get the whole nut, I'll be here, you know what I'm saying?

[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.680]
Get off the pants now, it's on the covers now

[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.760]
We hear tomorrow when his luck gets down on you

[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.580]
Judge James Brown

[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:08.960]
Alright, that's 33 at 560 W2QM, so I went like getting back to our last nights at the buckle in the Macarena before a very strange crowd of strangers

[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:13.060]
Because everybody was eating a lot of mozza and dipping their thing in the assault water

[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.080]
You know, it's astonishing to me but I guess it shouldn't be

[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.700]
And by the way Joe with the thick voice that calls the morning team with that old chronic caller

[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:25.620]
First thing I get in my car this morning at home, I'm back in out the car, turn on the radio and there's that Joe with the thick voice

[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:29.120]
You'd recognize, he's been calling the shows for 100 years in this town, doesn't know what he's talking about

[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.240]
Oh, I want to salute the Panthers because actually they're over 500, well guess what Joe?

[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:37.320]
They're not over 500, they're game under, they've been a mediocre 500 team all year long

[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.260]
Okay, they're not over 500 and then spider what I said yesterday

[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:45.120]
Now after last nights at the buckle against the horsecraft team, chances to play off I would say are like

[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:47.420]
Yeah, like that

[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.520]
Here's the team that came in here last night that had won only once in their last 13 games

[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:57.000]
The lowly New York Islanders are only nine points ahead of Tampa going into last night

[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.460]
The second worst team in league

[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:07.100]
They show up and it's obvious anybody watching that game who understood the sport of hockey knew that this team had no interest in playing that game

[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.560]
They were going through the motions each and every one of them

[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.320]
Panthers are ahead two to one, okay in the second period

[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:21.200]
Islanders are like putting out a listless effort, the shots are like about 25 to four, something like that for Florida or 20 to four

[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:25.260]
Now all of a sudden thanks to a bonehead play, I don't want to match you no names, okay?

[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:30.520]
A big guy named I don't want to match thanks to a bonehead play we let it back in the game now it's two to two

[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:39.060]
At that point all of a sudden just like in that Colorado game a few weeks ago when the Panthers blew a five nothing like you could see the guy saying on the other team

[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:45.240]
Oh, guess what we might actually win this game well, it'll be fun. It doesn't make any difference. Let's beat the crap out of these guys. They want to give it to us

[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:54.140]
And from that point on they had us on to run the whole rest of the night. I mean it was no no a contender. No contest in embarrassing performance

[00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.060]
Very sad

[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:07.200]
Nothing anybody should be proud of it was it was pathetic Mark Parrish there you go mark on eight twenty goals that kids dynamite four of last five Panther goals

[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.020]
He scored him he's doing it

[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:16.480]
Victor Crosloss skating around in those big loop the loops again. He won't shoot the puck old Kirk Mueller old man

[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.520]
Mueller every time he gets a couple of chances it looked like one time he had a sure chance for a goal

[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:27.440]
He stands there. He's gonna take the shot. He stops. He's thinking about he takes a shot right into the goal tenders pads right into flaredies pads no chance

[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:35.980]
And in the second and the early part of the third period when it is this desperate game went on and on since team don't want to take any of the blame for this by the way

[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:45.280]
typical Murray. He don't want to take any of the blame. I'm seeing Chris Wells and Kirk Mueller out there so much I'm screaming. I started screaming at that point

[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.520]
I was so pissed off

[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:54.280]
Here's the game you have to win the seasons on the line. We want to make those playoffs everybody said in your playoff ticket money, okay?

[00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:01.260]
And he's putting out a couple of guys that couldn't score into the Atlantic Ocean if nobody else were standing around with a hundred yards

[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.720]
I don't get it but like I said the organization is lucky

[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:13.480]
Lucky because the euphoria has just spilled over and spilled over and the pop-up burry thing no matter what they say from here on in

[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:18.680]
I'm not going to believe him either. I have no idea what the real story is because they want they got a pack you know 18

[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.880]
19,000 people in every game for next season even though the chances now making the playoffs are slim to none

[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:39.440]
Just astonishing to me can't see the goal at when a goal is scored and I'm the only person out of how many thousands of people during all of the home games this team has played how many people have been through that place

[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:46.360]
Hundreds of thousands probably over the course of this first year there and nobody else seems to think that's important

[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:54.300]
That's why I say the luckiest organization in the history of mankind even though they were public stock baby in the toilet

[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:59.200]
Look at this phone by the way all the calls we've had this morning so far evidently

[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.080]
Hey, why was listed to the first team George?

[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.660]
Oh, I don't want to talk to that bag it but what's the story on that the dog?

[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.120]
Oh, my name huh they don't know my name oh, that's good they don't you're a hooliow either

[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:22.140]
5 6 7 0 5 60 we don't have one call on the board here right now how do you like that 5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the mobile one line

[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.020]
This is the Neal Roger show

[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.720]
This is your brain

[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.680]
Any question?

[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.240]
Well, I think it turns right

[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.660]
For me to touch my body

[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.220]
One thought there I'm a body

[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.060]
It just give a near crew

[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.600]
So I got to look twice

[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.040]
And find myself a hideaway

[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.640]
And I know one could hide away

[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.500]
And I close that room

[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.580]
Oh, I find my played boys there

[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.960]
Creamy and ocean

[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.480]
Put the towel right down on the floor

[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.340]
George Quirk

[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.640]
Oh, I put my wrist action

[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.560]
In that explosion

[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:19.020]
And I pray that no one accidentally opens up the door

[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.780]
I got a masturbator

[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.500]
I got a masturbator

[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.860]
Yeah, I got a masturbator

[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.500]
I got a masturbator

[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:28.880]
I got a masturbator

[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.260]
Alright

[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.640]
1043 at 560 WDQAM

[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.860]
I'll tell you it's had 72 million calls most of them don't want to be on the earth of course

[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.560]
Thanks a lot guys

[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:42.720]
Unconscionable

[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:44.320]
Unbelievable

[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.500]
People want to be a fauna

[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.000]
See, this is an act to me of desperation

[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.920]
I mean, I realize you guys have been lagging behind in the numbers in the morning

[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.700]
And I realize that

[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.780]
And you've been costing the rest of us a lot of money on those bonuses too, by the way

[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:57.720]
I understand that

[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.080]
But if you think you're gonna just getting a little publicity for a cheap April Fool stunt

[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.400]
Is gonna put you over the top

[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.580]
All that does is destroy everybody's credibility and screw us up here now

[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:09.400]
Because instead of anybody want to talk about what I'm talking about which is important stuff to me

[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.960]
They still call, oh what's the number?

[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.500]
What do you want to know the real story is you were had, okay?

[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.120]
All you sports nerds out there, you were had

[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.220]
I was had because coming to work at one point they had me believing it

[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:22.780]
There was no trade

[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.720]
Richmond Webb, he ain't going anywhere

[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.400]
Karim Abdul, Jabbar, he ain't going anywhere

[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.440]
You were had

[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:36.040]
On a cheap April Fool stunt, an act of total and pure idiotic desperation

[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.940]
I remember years ago you know talk about April

[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.720]
See I'm not into those corn ball kind of contrived

[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.960]
I'll look corn you know goes with certain guys in that morning show

[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.020]
I'm not into it

[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.720]
Number years and years ago on KAT I guess it wasn't Craig Worthing

[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.340]
Went on a year one day on April Fool's Day

[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.840]
And of course our audience in KAT he was basically very very old and mostly old women

[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:01.360]
And Craig went to the thing well today's my last day at a radio and I've decided to hang it up

[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.020]
And it's been wonderful I love y'all and blah blah blah but I'm going to go up to Kenobunk Board main

[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.100]
If I could tell you the weeping women

[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.320]
The weeping old Yenthah that started to call

[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.360]
Oh please great tell me this

[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.720]
I mean I thought some of these people were going to have a stroke

[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:23.500]
And it got so bad that he finally had to you know break down and say okay April Fool I'm just kidding you please calm down

[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.240]
Don't kill yourself etc and so on

[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:31.500]
What's the point I mean it's like it's like the tooth fairy you know it's like the Easter bunny

[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:36.800]
We reach a certain point in life where things like that were you know it were fine but you like a little kid you know

[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.120]
Pull my finger that's fine

[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:44.920]
Once you get to be you know 70 80 years old you don't the fuller than anymore so much in your finger either

[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.780]
Here's a lady in coconut crere hello

[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.740]
Hey Neil how are you okay man

[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:55.540]
I just listened to all that BS at the beginning of the show before you got on

[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:59.580]
Which I mean you feel really stupid listen and call in and think that that was going on

[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.500]
But I was at the hockey game last night

[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:01.860]
Yes

[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:06.720]
And I should have been home actually with my family celebrating the holiday but as a Panther fan

[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.620]
Going to my 36 games

[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:12.580]
I'm so nauseated by the Jewish hockey fans of South Florida

[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:17.520]
And they're almost universal absence last night you can eat your maca any night of the week you want

[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:22.460]
You can have your satyr tonight there's no hockey game you can have it tomorrow night you can have it whenever you want okay

[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.400]
I mean where's the loyalty where's the priority for crying out loud

[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:29.600]
I mean if I'm out of town of course I can't be at the game if they went out of town for the holidays

[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:34.760]
Okay God bless them but if they're here in town and they're sitting around giving their tickets away to a bunch of strangers

[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.020]
I'm sorry that's not there they have no real interest

[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.760]
I definitely agree with you and last night's show

[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.400]
If I tell you I am so sick and tired of them putting Chris Wells on the ice

[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:47.220]
He is forever and over and over again

[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.000]
Here's one of the most non-productive people we have in a team

[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.360]
And in the most important game that we've got in here that we must win to keep our hopes alive

[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.880]
He's out there in Kirk motor

[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.640]
Everybody who couldn't get the job done they're out there and in northern amount of time

[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.580]
Motor was out there at one point I thought the shift must have been a minute and a half

[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.920]
I've never seen anybody that old player shift that long in my life

[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.820]
Well I'm the first one to get rid of Wells as soon as possible

[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:15.000]
Get some players on there that can at least play defensively, play offensively, score

[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.980]
We can't live with parish alone and we can't have a team like that we're not going in here

[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:21.780]
Well that's what you've got

[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.920]
Well I don't know what to do but I live in section 414

[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.800]
Bowen every time I see Needamire near the crease

[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.200]
Yeah

[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.780]
I don't know

[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:30.980]
Okay well season pays off

[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.060]
That's great

[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.740]
560-560 on a mobile one line here's a mobile in Kindle

[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:37.260]
Hello

[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:38.740]
Good morning Neal

[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:39.180]
Yes sir

[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.520]
How are you doing today I've got a couple things for you here

[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:45.020]
First of all those whammy spots must make you puke every time

[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.800]
I really couldn't care less we like the money we'll take it thank you

[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.560]
I don't work okay

[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:54.480]
Neal listen you open my eyes to something don't get mad quick as I know you hate to work golf

[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.780]
But I love golf and what you open my eyes to is quit going to those tournaments

[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.800]
They're so boring walking around

[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.180]
I just threw my tickets away this year gave me a new one

[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:08.040]
Why did it take me to convince you that didn't you already know that I mean wasn't this painfully obvious that it was boring

[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:08.740]
What's the point?

[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:10.660]
Well the point is this

[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:15.020]
When are you going to stop going to this boring hockey games with such a half-ass team?

[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.820]
Sir I got news for okay when you were a fan

[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.240]
You don't go to the games only if your team is good

[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.000]
See you're perfect for this town

[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.480]
You're the definitive caller okay

[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.040]
If the team is good or bad I don't care

[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:30.240]
I'd like them to be good but you know something I lived through 20 years of mediocrity with the Maple Leafs

[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:34.400]
And here I am 40 years later and I'm still as much of a fan as I was in 1958

[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.220]
How do you like that?

[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.940]
I guess you don't like it because you can't relate to it can you

[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.780]
Neal no perfect for South Florida

[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.520]
You're the perfect for running for me

[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:45.580]
I go to the games because I'm a fan and because I root for the team and I hope for the best

[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.840]
And even if they think the joint I would stay off and do

[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.280]
I show up and I hope I see it to golf tournament okay

[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.000]
Not you jackass

[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.420]
Perfect there's a golf guy

[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.260]
I got news for the most boring Panther game in the world

[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:03.400]
Is more exciting by a million times than your prick and golf tournaments okay

[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:10.340]
Why do I go because I'm a fan of which we have very very few in this town

[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.400]
Even though I don't wear the right jacket all the time to please that fat lady

[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.960]
That was their last week too bad I still show up there and root for the team okay

[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.500]
What do you go because I like it

[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.400]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 anybody from out of town here for the holidays

[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.580]
What you just heard right there that's what this town is all about

[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.960]
What you heard this morning for a couple of hours with that phony April full stun

[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:38.360]
Would everybody running around calling and doing cart flips and losing bets and everything

[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.980]
That's what this town's all about

[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.260]
Blush league baby

[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.340]
But what do you go?

[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.440]
And don't tell us about our satyrs important to us

[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.540]
Well isn't that sad?

[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.160]
That breaks my heart

[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.940]
That just breaks my heart that it's so important to sit around eating a bunch of

[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:59.100]
Because some maniacs decided thousands of years ago that you're going to eat horse radish

[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.960]
And seaweed and the purportly and salt water

[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.820]
Breaks my heart

[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:11.860]
Like I said yesterday when it comes to me I'm unconventional and I'm proud of it

[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:15.320]
I'm not just another one of the sheep who does almost everything in my life

[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.520]
Because this is the way it's supposed to be

[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.460]
Sorry, not for this kid

[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.560]
Here's a mobile and four-letter mail. Hello

[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.840]
Neil? Yes sir

[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.600]
Dr. Bernstein's HNIe is doing

[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.240]
Okay

[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.680]
Are you not going to bore us again?

[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.600]
No, no you're not

[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:36.240]
Wait, I got a question

[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.520]
You said yesterday that you were bothered by a heartburn, are you?

[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.000]
No, I did not say that and I'm not and have a nice day

[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:46.020]
5 6 7 see when I wanted this guy to call he wouldn't call

[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.260]
All you had to do sir when I was asking you to call a couple weeks ago

[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.100]
Was say to George the guy was great, he didn't wonder his for me

[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.780]
That's all very simple

[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.420]
And then I would have felt good and I would have continued saying hey yeah

[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.020]
Dr. Bernstein the book is great if you're diabetic if you're fat

[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.520]
That's great, that's all I wanted to know

[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.360]
I don't want to hear disease today I'm talking about stuff

[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.800]
I want a response today to what I'm talking about

[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.020]
Not about whether I got a heartburn okay, whatever I got a fat gas

[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.000]
In fact I didn't have bad gas until your call

[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.480]
Now there's another one for you, how do you like that?

[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.340]
And another one

[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.520]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line

[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.320]
Here's the mobile in Margate, hello

[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.140]
How you doing now?

[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:24.760]
I don't know

[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:30.960]
I got a solution for this cry baby basketball plays, hockey plays football plays

[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.660]
Send in the coast of all let them fight

[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.420]
Take that tail away

[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.900]
Yeah, let that fight

[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.880]
Yeah, if the hot air like it when they get 70 dollars fast over there

[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.580]
Okay, how about we send your fat ass over there

[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:42.680]
Whatever kind of ass you got, which I don't want to know

[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.940]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line

[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.660]
Sounded like it's not like Stumpy Jr to me if you ask me

[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.720]
Worth line me B, hello

[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.280]
Hey Neil, yes sir

[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.940]
If people are stupid like they are

[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.780]
If you are stupid like they are

[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:00.260]
If you are, they are

[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:03.660]
If you are wonder like they got a city of the day about George Rippen the callers and categorizing them

[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.760]
We don't want dumb callers, I mean a few of them are okay if they're fun

[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.980]
But we're looking for somebody that's got something to say

[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.020]
Okay, right, but anyway go ahead

[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.500]
But if God made us in his image

[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.980]
Yes, God must be awfully dumb

[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:16.540]
And a little ugly on the side

[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.420]
Right, thanks Neil

[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:23.180]
Okay, why didn't he make us in Ray Whitney's image for Christ's day

[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.800]
There you go, and by the way even for a raise in a coma too

[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.620]
Raising a slump happens to the best of us

[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.260]
But why in a third period there?

[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.460]
I think it was even on a power play

[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.520]
I mean Ray and Kavasha they're all skating around in big circles

[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.960]
That's how we were going to see like hockey players on ice

[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.380]
The Rockettes, what was that?

[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.660]
Did anybody see that last night?

[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:38.980]
No

[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:43.420]
They always like doing big loopy loops there in our own end on a power play

[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.920]
Like go the other way guys down there

[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.800]
That's where the medis were supposed to stick to the biscuit and the basket

[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.500]
That was bizarre

[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.000]
See, I think it's contagious

[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.360]
Maybe you see I don't go to practice because guys that go to practice have a mental problem

[00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:01.660]
But if panther practice Terry Murray must have them doing loopty loops or fruit loops or something

[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.360]
Because they're all doing the

[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.660]
They're doing a coslaw thing now

[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.020]
The Victor coslaw loopty loop

[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:10.000]
Kavasha is doing that now and even Ray Whitney was doing that last night

[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.500]
Skating around in circles

[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.320]
Do we have that little coround in circles?

[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:15.380]
Jerk

[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.880]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood

[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.240]
Hello

[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.180]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.840]
Happy whatever to you sir, happy daily life savings time

[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.940]
There you go

[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:28.600]
Listen, you know, you're talking about this thing with Pavel Murray

[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.860]
Yes, and then you know, earlier shows you know that I listen to you know

[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:36.820]
This thing with Wayne Heisen and the, you know, what he did with the baseball team and everything like that

[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:42.680]
And I mean, you know, to some people I guess it's important but really if you think about it you know

[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:48.240]
It's just like with the last part of the golf situation South Florida fans deserve what they get

[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.380]
You know, I don't disagree with that, that's true, you're right

[00:39:51.380 --> 00:40:02.000]
The average fan, I mean the best vast majority of them, it's not about team and you know

[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:08.040]
Getting behind your team, it's about like you know being seen at taffy, she she

[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.120]
Here you go, man, I got it, that's right

[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:14.440]
And you know, I got people sitting in front of me at the Panther Games

[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:18.240]
They spent half of the game waving to people, I don't even know if they really exist

[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.880]
Over there if they're just doing it to piss me off so their arm could be in my face

[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.320]
Waving across the other side, they're waving, I mean what was that?

[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.840]
How about watching the game and then as soon as they get done waving

[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.620]
They grab one of their 18 kids and they get up and they go out for a food and go to take a dump

[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:34.580]
And whatever they're doing, I mean there are very few fans of any sport in this town

[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:38.440]
That's why this whole concept of a sports station and expecting people to call it

[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:42.520]
With intelligent comments about sports, we don't have sports fans here, we have spectators

[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.920]
We have people who put answers in the seat

[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:52.360]
I mean you know, you look at maybe like like you see with how you are with as a leaf fan suffering from mediocrity

[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:58.200]
You look at a maybe a good analogy that is the community like in Wisconsin, Green Bay

[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.720]
You know the packers suck forever, you know

[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:07.220]
But those people, they live in, they're real sports fans there

[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:10.680]
They appreciate what they got here in South Florida

[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:16.260]
You know, I mean the baseball team went to the World Series where they made the playoffs

[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.860]
They couldn't even sell out some of the playoffs

[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.740]
That's right because there was no interest

[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.840]
It's just so exciting

[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:29.880]
I go to these hockey games and I come on here the next day and I practically, I practically work myself into a frenzy

[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.040]
Trying to get some response on things that should be so obvious

[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.000]
And it's like I'm the only one that sees these things, nobody else cares

[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.840]
Why should we, why should the red liqueur, I'm going to goal this group, why should you be able to see it

[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.780]
I mean why should the ice be of quality that guys aren't like in injured all the time

[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:49.700]
Nobody else cares about these things because they're just like you said they're there to socialize and schmooze

[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:55.260]
We don't have fans here, we got a handful of fans and a bunch of people who want to stick their ass in the seat

[00:41:55.260 --> 00:42:01.040]
Especially if the corporation gave it to them or their friends gave it to them because their friends are having a pants over a sater or whatever

[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:01.920]
They're not fans

[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:05.440]
But they know it's on the menu though, you know what I'm saying

[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:09.280]
You know, and they know the proctists who have been here, you know

[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.320]
I'll see you at the golf tournament

[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.380]
I'll see you at the Lipton

[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.700]
I'll see you at the Honda Classic and the Lipton

[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.480]
Anybody want to go to the Lipton?

[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.460]
No, no

[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:23.200]
Ship a little iced tea at the Lipton, sit around be a real pseudo intellectual

[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.500]
5.6 a.m. yeah right

[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:29.680]
Let's go to the tennis tournament, don't make too much noise though because it's love 30 now

[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.820]
It's very important sir, come on, let's service

[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.800]
Let's try it again

[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.240]
5.6 7 0 5 60, pound 5 60 on the mobile one line

[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.540]
What a crock, a crap

[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.120]
You know what I said?

[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:41.920]
Crap, crap

[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:42.340]
Right

[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:44.340]
4.8 a.m.

[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:49.640]
I'm a 4.8

[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.080]
Happy prom!

[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.760]
Have you ever heard a popular rap song in the radio and thought?

[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.100]
Heck, I could do that

[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.740]
You're probably right

[00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:00.060]
All it takes is a little ambition, some karaoke-esque musical backup

[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:00.980]
And 1995

[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.940]
Yes, I left a talent for a reason

[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:08.220]
With the Puff Daddy rap along CD set, you'll be hitting it just like some of the top rap stars of today

[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.480]
All year, a back and back

[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.060]
Yeah

[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:17.640]
With little to no musical talent and even the less creative thinking, you'll be a chart buster in mere weeks

[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.320]
All year, it's the time of your life

[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:20.680]
Yeah

[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:27.300]
The Puff Daddy rap along CD set even comes with a handy booklet that shows you how to get older rock stars to help you with your projects

[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.940]
All year, a good, a good, yeah

[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:35.720]
The Puff Daddy rap along CD set, just 1995 is just about all it takes

Order now

[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.440]
Yeah, man

[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.380]
11.02 at 5.60 WQ, I'm happy paysock, okay?

[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:48.240]
To all you people out there, there were two busy to come to the game last night

[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.760]
And gave you a ticket to a way to a bunch of marginal people

[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.140]
There were some nice people there last night

[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.140]
A boy, there were some people that were like lost

[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.700]
And then Joe Castell was telling me about where he was sitting

[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.320]
A bunch of rude obnoxious people with their pretty little kids

[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.220]
With the balloons on their head that kept poking them with the balloons

[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.260]
And the old bag sticking her headway out there

[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.220]
So make sure that nobody to her left or right could see what was going on out there

[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:09.680]
Any ice?

[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:13.260]
See one thing you won't find in this town, the word

[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.600]
Considerate, if you look at your dictionary in South Florida

[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.960]
The word Considerate has been removed from all dictionaries in this town

[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.420]
The idea that anybody is considered to anybody else

[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:22.060]
Sorry

[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:24.100]
Sorry

[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.560]
Don't have that here, so you're not going to do a long reach that I'm sitting up in this chair

[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.480]
5.670560

[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.720]
And now I understand the last few days I've been sitting here screaming and yelling

[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:37.680]
I go to the arena last night, that's the one thing I kept going through my mind

[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.160]
I looked around and I saw until about 725 there was like nobody there

[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.480]
Because everybody else had been given these tickets

[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.460]
The understander, they scalped them or however they got them

[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.360]
These were not the regular people that come there

[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.560]
And I thought to myself, I'm on the air here every day screaming and wondering why I can't get calls

[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.840]
99% of my callers are Jews

[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.120]
Right?

[00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.360]
And even the ones that aren't you, was even the Julio's out there

[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.240]
They're going out and getting circumcised because they're jealous

[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.040]
And I'm sitting here getting all bent out of shape

[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:09.160]
I mean, it's priorities man, I'm not important, the hockey games not important

[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.560]
Eating lots is important

[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.440]
Oh, we've been doing this for thousands of years

[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.480]
When you've been getting persecuted for thousands of years too

[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.920]
Does that make it good for Christ's sake?

[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:16.180]
No

[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.180]
Sorry, I should've left him out

[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:18.480]
He ain't feeling too good

[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.000]
He's getting ready to get nailed up there again tomorrow

[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.420]
Any tomorrow that day he got nailed up there on the cross

[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.300]
With that thorny, horny crown on his head

[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.480]
And every time you touch yourself, even it's just to go to take a leak

[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.300]
That crown, the thorns get too deep into his head

[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:37.700]
They must be coming out to bed, they must be protruding by now

[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.540]
Just along from the stuff that goes on in the Vatican

[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:44.520]
They must be poking out in the thorns too

[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.260]
Remember that's here is the thornbirds

[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.460]
Oh and by the way, speaking of that, I can't with nice jobs here at Bettman

[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.940]
What's that Atlanta franchise, the thrashers?

[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.400]
Have you seen the logo for that?

[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.060]
The ugliest, I don't know if it's a bird if it's a like the two-po'-cop

[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.320]
But I don't know what a thrashers supposed to be, some kind of a bird I guess

[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.340]
And that's what they're going to be for us for the birds

[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.840]
Y'all, that that leak isn't so much trouble in HL

[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.520]
And that little perpy bastard from Cornell, Gary Batman

[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:13.160]
This guy is destroying it, he is buttering it

[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.600]
More and more new franchises

[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.640]
We already got all these other failing franchises

[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.860]
Let's go back to places that already failed before

[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.480]
Give him another chance at Atlanta, Minnesota

[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.580]
I was gonna happen there

[00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:21.720]
No

[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.760]
It's gonna be disaster, nice going, Gary, you little perp

[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.960]
I hope you have a lousy pace off, Gary Batman

[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.660]
I hope somebody poisons your mottes, that's what I think about you

[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:31.620]
A killer

[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:34.020]
Here's Miami, hello

[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.040]
Neil

[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:35.560]
Yes sir

[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:36.540]
How are you today?

[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:36.780]
Great

[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:42.780]
I wanted to comment about the sellout fans of South Florida

[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.900]
Yes sir, how do you like the guy calling in the chewing me out for going to the game

[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:47.740]
Even though I got a crappy team, how do you like that?

[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:49.000]
Oh, he was a schwa-

[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:49.740]
What a putz

[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:53.720]
Somebody ought to stuff a golf ball up his neck down in a seven iron two while he's at it

[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:58.420]
Right, I mean you could go to every South Florida sporting event

[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:04.080]
And if they're not in the playoffs, they're either scouting their tickets, they're selling their tickets

[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.540]
That's right, you got it

[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:08.840]
And he's schmucked, so called South Florida fan

[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.280]
Sure, most of these people wouldn't know the meaning of the word fan

[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.380]
If somebody had branded it on their forehead, they still wouldn't understand what a fan is all about

[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:20.300]
This is the only place in America where you have to give a primer to people on what it means to be a fan

[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:23.580]
Well, all South Florida is is keep up with the joses

[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:26.360]
I mean, they're slits across the street, they buy season tickets

[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:26.660]
Right

[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:29.420]
Well, let's get season tickets and if they don't go, we don't go

[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:35.180]
And the fact that all these people decided to eat and stay on Mocca was more important than I said to come in and supporting their team when they need to support

[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:37.140]
That shows that goes to show you right there

[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.120]
They don't care that much, they sure don't care enough

[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:43.860]
Well, a good point is when Pondville Murray, when they announced that he wasn't going to be playing for the rest of season

[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.800]
All these people were rushing to the ticket office, I want my refund

[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.560]
That's right

[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.120]
That's right

[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.500]
Same crap every year

[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:54.620]
Whether it's football hockey basketball, whatever, it's the same crap

[00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:56.780]
Amen

[00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:58.880]
Okay, Neil, thanks

[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.480]
And happy day-like savings time

[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.260]
You too

[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:02.720]
See ya

[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:06.980]
That's something we can all agree on, okay, not even if you don't like it, we can agree because it's going to happen with you

[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.500]
Like it or not, it's going to be day-like savings time, sure tonight

[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:13.440]
What do they say, spring ahead, fall back on your net's weight works

[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:15.380]

[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:44.960]
Starving! People are starving and we got crazy old orthodox Jews burning bread because it's leavened. I wonder what they're thinking about. Probably saving a lot of lives by burning that wonder bread, I'll tell you that. They really are. That's that stuff will kill you. White bread. So I cotton candy. White cotton candy, that's what it is, with a crust on it. Kind of like most of your underwear. Crusty.

[00:49:46.400 --> 00:50:14.840]
Crash. I'll bring a nice piece of rib bread or pumpernacle. Now you're talking. You like rib bread. Like dark. That's great. I like bread. You love bread. Okay. Two open lines, five, six, seven, up, five, six, eight, eight. I don't know how I feel about that thing this morning. I mean, I'm nauseated by it. Why did they do that? And then of course, Barry.

[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:19.160]

[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.900]
all the first team pulls Aprilful and you know I'll get some free publicity but it's not going to be

[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:25.080]
good publicity it's going to make them look stupid

[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:30.340]
there this is the voice of the dolphins it's irresponsible it's dumb

[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:35.080]
get everybody whipped up and they were frenzy I mean people were really think that stuff is important

[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:38.360]
which of course it's not but they're these sports nerds who think that's important

[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.920]
and they got these people running around like chickens with their heads cut off

[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.680]
because then they make them some cock-a-many story and then they're putting

[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.460]

[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:57.400]

[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:37.240]
anybody see nobody has any opinion on the stuff they pulled this morning and what does that

[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:41.080]
tell me see it's interesting because we got flooded with calls there but they weren't people

[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:45.140]
calling it would be having to do with you or me or this show they were like you know when they

[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:50.560]
used to do that what's your beef thing on Thursdays 20 minutes after 10 maybe oh I want to register

[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:56.020]
my beef well guess what the beef ended 20 minutes ago asshole you know they don't get it I don't

[00:57:56.020 --> 00:58:00.220]
think there's any crossover between the worst team in this show is there any at all none

[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:06.720]
because I'm really interested is it only me because I thought that thing this morning was just uh

[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:12.120]
I'm speechless about I can't even find the words to describe it and believe me I've been around

[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:16.000]
to block a few times I know all about every station in America there's these stupid April first

[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:24.500]
on April fool Maddie out of you know but this was like uh how do I describe it how do I describe

[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:30.360]
it it was just the ridiculous carried to an extreme over something I'm sure the dolphin

[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:36.420]
organization must have really liked it but they were big on it here's a mobile and pompe

[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:42.580]
chill out Neil yes sir it goes back to the thing you always say this is not a sports town

[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:50.280]
yeah at the bottom line yes sir that's right you could take the panthers the dolphins and the

[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:56.360]
marlins and they could become a mass unit as banged up as they are yeah so obviously it's

[00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:00.540]
had to be something going on with the doctors well I you know all I can go is based on my own

[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:04.980]
personal experiences and what I see going on with these other guys and I'm just that place I'm

[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:08.860]
you know I'm not apologizing anybody that's my honest opinion I have no accident right with

[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:12.640]
anybody over there but I'm very disappointed in what they've done for me and so my confidence

[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:17.280]
level and that joint is very low very low let's say if you pull this up on the net the first

[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:21.780]
thing is got everybody going because it's a double reversal you pull up on the net that

[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:28.000]
you got your dot NFL dot com yeah and pain is done it's a done deal yeah so there's an end

[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.260]
pulling a double reversal April fool's y'all great and all over all over America people are

[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:35.960]
going to be jumping off bridges I got somebody to do it frankly yes sir

[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:40.740]
Anthony Scott your dish bag okay thanks for the good news you now they spread in of course you

[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:44.960]
know if it's on the internet it's probably a pile of crap that's one thing I've learned about

[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:48.780]
the internet is every moron every jackass every retard I mean there's a lot of good stuff

[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:52.800]
under too there's some real useful interesting stuff but you really got a sift I mean you know

[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:56.760]
when you when you put something in there you do a search and you put something in there and it says

[00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:02.280]
okay here here are 10 of two million six hundred eighty three thousand responses you're starting

[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:09.900]
to understand again some concept of how much how much infinite material is in there you know you

[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:15.340]
could put the word rectum in there okay here's the top 10 of 72 million four hundred and sixty two

[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:20.960]
thousand responses just to the word rectum there's a lot of assholes out there you know that must be

[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:26.480]
the reason but wow there's just so much swill in that internet and so they put they put a

[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:32.140]
farce on over here and now it's going to be spreading like wildfire what what a contrast between

[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:36.820]
the day when they were reporting by the we all morning long about Jimmy Johnson resigning in the

[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:41.080]
newspapers as well what a contrast between that and the day that Hank called me on air remember that

[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.160]
day very vividly tell me the real story that he was holding a press conference and he was staying

[01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:50.000]
and that Hank broke that story the first anywhere in the universe in spite of what channel seven

[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.560]
lie that they did which they didn't do by the way liars what a contrast between those two okay

[01:00:55.820 --> 01:01:00.060]
I mean even if you want to have some fun on the on April fools they you still have to be concerned

[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:04.840]
about your credibility I realize we got some guys in the station maybe you don't have any credibility

[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:11.380]
maybe that's the if you don't have it you can't keep it right here's here's Miami hello good morning

[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:18.760]
now where is this the the April fool joke yes yes both of them if somebody listened to the station

[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:24.220]
for the first time this morning yes it would have appeared that they they were the April fool joke

[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:31.780]
the two guys now let me tell you yesterday from two to four in radio man be yeah radio be the

[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:38.400]
honor guest who do you think was the honor guest still the honor of the statement no done lebatar

[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:45.380]
then the back you hero in the Cuban community he's an asshole demand that save our honor and you

[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:51.120]
know what he said among the many stupid things that he said that he had many offers to go to

[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:59.120]
bigger and better market yeah like somebody had to stay in the Miami head to save us to fight for us

[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.160]
in a very weird time we tell him we pay his bus fare to go like anywhere like to

[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:09.060]
uh in a very bad Spanish right away because the guy doesn't even speak proper Spanish he doesn't

had nothing to do with the Miami head of ten fifteen years that's right as being objective

[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:37.680]

[01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:43.190]
the fans had only been all hockey games going on that's right it was so quiet when the game started i

[01:31:43.190 --> 01:31:48.010]
thought i was at a funeral not one bit of a motion from the this is a big rivalry now you know

[01:31:48.010 --> 01:31:53.430]
they're going for absolutely correct that's right it was nothing going on these people did not know

[01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:56.970]
what hockey games going on they should be the shame that i saw i'm a ranger fan i was wearing

[01:31:56.970 --> 01:32:02.110]
ranger jersey now i was down but they spend to not deserve hockey down here they should just sit

[01:32:38.170 --> 01:32:41.030]

[01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:47.270]
they might as well have last night coach he's in the dark we'll see it terry i think it's

[01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:53.670]
going to be goodbye to be in and goodbye to tm at the end of this year play a lowly team like the

freaking allotters who don't even show up let me say it again they did they barely even got off

[01:32:58.130 --> 01:33:03.850]
the the team bus that's how uninvolved and disinterested they were in the proceedings in the

[01:33:03.850 --> 01:33:07.890]
macaroon the last night they were just basically saying here take all the shots you want go and have

[01:33:07.890 --> 01:33:13.150]
a good time we don't give a crap and we didn't have a lot of shots but of course most of them

[01:33:13.150 --> 01:33:17.050]
not real scoring chances and many many of them want to the net and we got victor who wouldn't shoot

[01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:23.210]
it if they give him a god damn uzi and then they we let him tie it up thanks to that bad bad play

[01:33:23.210 --> 01:33:29.030]
at center ice by the big black guy named peter nice going air peter and they tie it up all of a

[01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:32.390]
sudden they said hey guess what these guys want to stand the game we have a one and so god damn

[01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:39.290]
long let's go and they did nice going Terry anyway

[01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:44.610]
here Roger's guy and now we see the president getting ready to deliver his address he's in the

[01:33:44.610 --> 01:33:50.310]
oval office with the gold drapes behind him and he is preparing to address the American people

[01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:57.750]
music plays my fellow Americans I have deployed our forces to put up a fight in a place called

[01:33:57.750 --> 01:34:08.830]

slap on a Milo Civic is mad because his nickname is slawb later of co-subble

[01:34:24.650 --> 01:34:35.930]
freekast enclosions hero Dep complicates

[01:34:54.570 --> 01:34:58.250]
So, a few minutes ago, evidently, right about the strokenoom.

[01:35:00.090 --> 01:35:05.130]
Over the intercom, somebody played, yesterday's a little song

[01:35:05.130 --> 01:35:08.290]
and a dance I did here about this gate club, about the inner circle here.

[01:35:09.330 --> 01:35:12.450]
I think it was earlier than that. Was it earlier? Oh, good.

[01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:14.830]
I hope so. I hope like before some people ran out of here for lunch.

[01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:17.670]
Whoever did it, God bless you. Thank you.

[01:35:18.970 --> 01:35:22.210]
About the little inner circle of Greg Read and his personal buddies and all these little

[01:35:22.210 --> 01:35:25.990]
ass-looking memos about the employee of the month and who's a good friend and a good person.

[01:35:26.190 --> 01:35:30.690]
And we only fired him 25 times. And we kept bringing him back and giving him a promotion and a

[01:35:30.690 --> 01:35:35.270]
title every time it came back because nobody else would hire him on a bet of.

[01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:41.450]
Yep, guess what? We're just here to do a job, Greg. We're not here to schmooze. We're not here to

[01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:44.990]
be part of your little inner circle. We're not here to look at the naked pictures. We're not here to

[01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:48.990]
hang out with all the other folks. Okay, we're just here to do a job. I know that's revolutionary.

[01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:53.410]
It might actually have something to do with broadcasting. But that's the language we speak.

[01:35:53.770 --> 01:35:59.170]
You got it? No. Didn't think so. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on a mobile one line.

[01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:01.630]
Here's a lady in West Palm Beach. Hello?

[01:36:03.670 --> 01:36:07.990]
Lady in West Palm. Again, 26 minutes, 13 seconds, she's gone.

[01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:12.110]
See these lines don't disconnect. Like, wait, this is number now we've re- we've gone back.

[01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:16.510]
What? 15 months. Time for the same person. There are dodo's over there. The same people,

[01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:21.490]
they put the phone down. They walk away. They're idiots. So in other words, you're saying this broad

[01:36:21.490 --> 01:36:25.230]
in West Palm is sticking the phone down. That's f***ing good. Maybe she's got it in her

[01:36:25.230 --> 01:36:31.250]
rectum. That's the problem. Maybe she's got an inner rear problem. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:35.710]
0, 5, 60 on a mobile one line. We're talking. And did we get, you know, isn't this amazing?

[01:36:36.370 --> 01:36:40.550]
Even after all the stuff that we got through on this show, this should be a real fly opener for

[01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:46.010]
everybody. If you could have seen the hysteria that was going on when I first sat down here this

[01:36:46.010 --> 01:36:50.910]
morning. And when we came on the air over this Joe Rose prank that they pulled about this

[01:36:50.910 --> 01:36:55.310]
make-believe dolphin trade that all these macho sports faggots got sucked into this morning

[01:36:55.310 --> 01:37:00.750]
about trading Richmond, Webb and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Dan Marino and Jimmy Johnson and the water

[01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:07.710]
boy for the 85th round draft picker. Some stupid thing. And I asked, I said, is anybody got anything

[01:37:07.710 --> 01:37:12.010]
that they think it was funny? Did they pissed off? Did they think it was a, have we had one call

[01:37:12.010 --> 01:37:20.690]
about that? No. No. I'm talking about on the air. We had 72,645 calls. We kept track off the air

[01:37:21.210 --> 01:37:26.750]
from people going, like that. Is it true? Yeah. Every one of them calling and saying,

[01:37:27.690 --> 01:37:34.150]
like that. What are you looking for, Brian? What's your, huh? He's out in the hallway. He's banging

[01:37:34.150 --> 01:37:42.570]
somebody in a hall. Not one call. Did we have an issue about that? Speak now or forever. Hold

[01:37:42.570 --> 01:37:46.590]
your piece. Okay. If there's anybody who heard that stuff this morning because otherwise,

[01:37:46.850 --> 01:37:50.570]
I'm convinced there may have been a little crossover like a year ago between the morning show and

[01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:56.490]
this one. Now I would say it's the big none. None. Never seen the big none. Wow. I'm going to have a

[01:37:56.490 --> 01:38:03.830]
chance. He's got five six seven, oh five 60 pound five 60 on a mobile one line. Here's Miramar. Hello.

[01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:09.790]
Hello, Neil. Yes. Neil. I had a true radio action in this morning. Yeah. I have been to be

[01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:16.050]
tuning over again, ready for your show and heard the, the hysteria. And you know, I thought at first,

[01:38:16.190 --> 01:38:21.270]
you know, this is April Fool's. Yeah. But when Hank came on, Hank didn't really come on there.

[01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:26.210]
Didn't he? Hey, Neil did a man with sports credibility like nobody else. I know in America

[01:38:26.210 --> 01:38:31.930]
who broke the Jimmy Johnson story all over the planet all over the world. This man came on and

[01:38:31.930 --> 01:38:36.810]
participated in a hoax this morning. That was your telling me, sir. Let me say you, Neil.

[01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:41.650]
That was funny. Hank's voice came on and said that he had been voice. He confirmed it. Yeah.

[01:38:42.130 --> 01:38:46.130]
Either, either a if they did use his voice, if I would say, who does it sounds like George?

[01:38:46.130 --> 01:38:50.450]
I would be pissed. You know who this sounds like? Who? You.

[01:38:52.050 --> 01:38:56.730]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound five 60 on a mobile one line. What was one of the, wasn't that? I

[01:38:56.730 --> 01:39:01.710]
can't even tell them apart anymore. Maybe it wasn't. If you're not one of those assholes, I apologize,

[01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:07.130]
sir. But for somebody to come on here and tell me that Hank would participate, a man like I said,

[01:39:07.330 --> 01:39:10.590]
I know Hank's got a good sense of humor. So do I. That's the only reason we survive in this business.

[01:39:10.590 --> 01:39:15.890]
But to participate in such a fraudulent thing, the dolphins, I mean next to this show,

[01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:21.870]
next to the Neil Rogers show, the dolphins are the marquee of this radio station. That's what Sam

[01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:24.590]
just told me. By the way, how is that? Have you been, have you heard from him yet?

[01:39:26.910 --> 01:39:30.770]
George? No. So he must be doing some business out there at the shell station. Well, I haven't

[01:39:30.770 --> 01:39:35.370]
promoted again because we've been busy. We haven't been, not either yet. It says from noon till

[01:39:35.370 --> 01:39:40.070]
whatever. I don't think I'll even leave soon enough because he was eating the free food. That's right.

[01:39:40.170 --> 01:39:43.890]
I saw him in there. Well, maybe the free food will improve his personality. We don't want to hear

[01:39:43.890 --> 01:39:48.670]
any more knocks to Chris Reed. Okay. We like Chris Reed. There's not too many people in the building. We

[01:39:48.670 --> 01:39:53.150]
like all that much, but he's one of me. He's a good guy. The fact that he's got a boring,

[01:39:53.150 --> 01:39:56.850]
bland personality, he can't help it that he's part of the read family that he's, you know,

[01:39:57.010 --> 01:40:00.790]
that he was born in as such a dull family. He's just getting there right now. He's just getting

[01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:05.230]
there right now. So now's the good time. You want those free tickets, marlins games, marlins and

[01:40:05.610 --> 01:40:11.230]
meds, H and R block night. Then the QAM van look forward to the shell station right there at

[01:40:11.230 --> 01:40:14.470]
Broward and University on the northeast corner. You know where it is right across from the convenience

[01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:18.690]
store where the plantation cops make the coffee 24 hours a day. And right next to that vet, I used to

[01:40:18.690 --> 01:40:26.270]
go to until okay, where's a mobile in dear field B? Chill out. Neil. Yes, sir. I was wondering,

[01:40:26.410 --> 01:40:31.770]
well, I know you didn't, but I was watching your buddy Larry King the other night. And he had on

[01:40:31.770 --> 01:40:38.910]
this before and minister, the Yugoslavian foreign minister. And this guy is just too dumb to play dumb.

[01:40:39.150 --> 01:40:44.190]
He was talking about that. Yeah. He was talking about the whole crisis. And he was calling, he was

[01:40:44.190 --> 01:40:50.550]
blaming NATO for committing crimes against humanity by not doing torture. Yeah. I mean, what is wrong

[01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:56.890]
with these people? Sir, anybody that's going to knock what is going on over there, anybody that's

[01:40:56.890 --> 01:41:01.290]
citing with these scumbag serves as far as I'm concerned, they need to be put in a scent of camp.

[01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:06.090]
We're watching, okay. You were watching these pictures of these tragic poor people walking with

[01:41:06.090 --> 01:41:10.490]
like a blanket or a coat or like little kids with a teddy bear under their arm. That's their whole life.

[01:41:10.650 --> 01:41:14.890]
That's all they got left. And you know, this business ethnic cleansing, the word is slaughter.

[01:41:15.190 --> 01:41:20.730]
They're slaughtering their barbarians, their butchers. There was more. This guy was also denying that

[01:41:20.730 --> 01:41:28.250]
the Serbian and what was Larry saying? Probably. Yeah. Yeah. Larry was, you know,

[01:41:28.450 --> 01:41:34.070]
stuck in anything controversial. Fucking around. Yeah. Yeah. Well, screw him, pal.

[01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:39.390]
I have to have whatever happy or whatever you're celebrating. Happy day like God damn savings time.

[01:41:41.090 --> 01:41:44.490]
I want to hear from some non-observant Jews out there who are sick and tired of all this stuff

[01:41:44.490 --> 01:41:48.050]
that our whole lives have to be interrupted. I mean, this is one of those, see, Hanukkah

[01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:51.930]
Passover eight day deal we got here now, see. Another eight day deal.

[01:41:53.230 --> 01:41:56.450]
Jews know how to do it, right? We don't do a holiday for like one day. Most of the holidays,

[01:41:56.690 --> 01:41:59.190]
I mean, young Kipper only one day because he wants to fast for eight days.

[01:42:00.970 --> 01:42:06.050]
But the really good ones we do multiple days. Jewish women, they don't do it. They don't even do

[01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:10.990]
single much less multiple orgasms, but multiple days for holidays. More days for Jeff to sell it.

[01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:15.910]
This is good stuff, by the way. Great stuff. And all the goyms. All the goyms are loving it too,

[01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:20.870]
by the way, this building. Well, I wish I could be here tomorrow to see all the people that are

[01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:27.430]
going to show up for a good Friday. Can't make it though. You know, listen, anybody thinks that I

[01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:35.570]
should be working on good Friday. I say screw you, okay? I'm a good Catholic boy. 5, 6, 7,

[01:42:35.670 --> 01:42:40.890]
05, 60. I've been in a Catholic church. In fact, I was working in what station was it in WALM

[01:42:40.890 --> 01:42:51.030]
and Albion, Michigan a million years ago, 1973. 70, 63. No, no, 65. 1965, I worked WALM

[01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:55.750]
in Albion, Michigan. And on the weekend, I used to have to go. I'm pretty sure that was the station.

[01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:59.570]
Go to the Catholic church. We used to carry the church service and set up the equipment there. Turn

[01:42:59.570 --> 01:43:04.290]
on the amplifiers. And, you know, so I used to have this at there and sit through a Catholic service.

[01:43:06.290 --> 01:43:10.790]
Did you take communion? And I used to watch them alter boys. And used to kind of

[01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:14.870]
give me these little facts in the church. Arouse the little bit. Did you go get on your knees and

[01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:19.810]
open your mouth? No, they were on your knees where their mouth opened. Here's the Lady Mobile in

[01:43:19.810 --> 01:43:26.530]
Coral Springs. Hello. Hello. Yes, ma'am. I love you, Neil. Of course. And I first thing I want to tell

[01:43:26.530 --> 01:43:32.890]
you is I'm Jewish and I was at the hockey game last night. Oh, great. Did you see Kurtz Walsk

[01:43:32.890 --> 01:43:39.790]
skating with a 2-2 on last night? What was he doing out there so much over and over? It was like

[01:43:39.790 --> 01:43:45.510]
Terry Murray was punching us with him. He's a jerk. Yeah. Couldn't stand them. But you know what?

[01:43:45.810 --> 01:43:51.910]
I don't know about the competition like some stupid idiotic jerk. Right. That's right. Anyway,

[01:43:52.050 --> 01:43:56.150]
and the other thing I wanted to tell you is we were so relieved to see you at the hockey game last

[01:43:56.150 --> 01:44:01.230]
night. Why is that? When we were going there, we passed a really bad car wreck and there was a

[01:44:01.230 --> 01:44:06.710]
Corvette there. Not mine. And we I know. Thank God. What color was it? You know, it was pretty dark.

[01:44:06.710 --> 01:44:12.670]
It looked like a dark color. We couldn't see the star. But it was nasty and it was a pile up.

[01:44:12.770 --> 01:44:17.630]
But we were very relieved that you were there. Where was it? I was right on the

[01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:23.290]
office of the Oakland Park saw Greta and right around the corner from the entrance to the parking

[01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:31.050]
once. It was really bad. Not this kid. Thank God. I get there nice and early. I was the only one

[01:44:31.050 --> 01:44:35.070]
in there. Me and the usher. There was nobody else in there. Was darker. Was fencer. Yeah, I know.

[01:44:35.070 --> 01:44:41.250]
I had my mom's and a wife just said it was okay to go. We were there. Okay, great.

[01:44:41.770 --> 01:44:46.990]
And the other thing too, I heard you say that the Murray brothers are like maybe toast at the

[01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:49.970]
end of this year. But that's just wishful thinking. I'm just praying.

[01:44:51.630 --> 01:44:55.730]
During these religious holidays over the weekend, including tomorrow, I'm spending all good Friday

[01:44:55.730 --> 01:45:00.110]
in church tomorrow with my catlick friend praying so we can say goodbye to the mother brother.

[01:45:00.110 --> 01:45:04.110]
I don't want to wish them any ill. Don't go away, mad. Just go away, boys.

[01:45:04.610 --> 01:45:08.550]
You got it. Okay. And how do you like that Wilson? He got a zelang, huh?

[01:45:08.590 --> 01:45:10.570]
Well, that was that was scary. That was very scary.

[01:45:10.570 --> 01:45:13.510]
For Mike Wilson, we just got him. He's a good kid. He's playing good for us.

[01:45:13.590 --> 01:45:18.090]
And this kid got a hit. There it was a clean hit. But he didn't see it coming in. Boy, he went down

[01:45:18.090 --> 01:45:23.610]
in a heap. I mean, he got just knocked out cool. And you always just hold your breath when you see

[01:45:23.610 --> 01:45:26.270]
that. But he finally got up. He'll be okay. Second to make concussion.

[01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:32.010]
And one last thing I'll leave you with. My husband taped your show three day off the radio. And we

[01:45:32.010 --> 01:45:37.230]
have for the last four years. And we have all your tapes. And we listen to them in our car

[01:45:37.230 --> 01:45:41.570]
whenever we take long trips. And we love you. Oh, God bless you sweetheart.

[01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:45.090]
Have a happy pay. Happy Shabuas. Thank you. Bye. Bye.

[01:45:46.970 --> 01:45:50.430]
1225 Joe Rose was the one that came up with the bonehead idea to take away the credibility

[01:45:50.430 --> 01:45:54.710]
from the warning show this morning. I say a pox. Okay. A poxie on you, man. I like Joe. He's a

[01:45:54.710 --> 01:45:58.850]
good guy. But man, this time there's time you went down to wrong road. Okay. I think that doctor

[01:45:58.850 --> 01:46:02.950]
over there maybe he's got a pointer to about you. In fact, that wouldn't be surprised if Dr.

[01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:06.610]
Orterian, even though he's not a brain surgeon, might want to do a little of bottomy on Joe Rose

[01:46:06.610 --> 01:46:11.410]
after whatever in the paper this morning. Little exploratory surgery in there to see if there's

[01:46:11.410 --> 01:46:17.210]
anything on the inside. Think there is no. Come up with some bogus half-ass. And you see the reason

[01:46:17.210 --> 01:46:21.110]
we're not hearing from these. They're listening. These sports bags. They're listening. But they're

[01:46:21.150 --> 01:46:27.210]
too embarrassed because they got sucked in. They got sucked in by the worst team this morning.

[01:46:28.010 --> 01:46:34.470]
How do you like that? How much are they like it? By the Jeff DeFloris and the little dog with a big

[01:46:34.470 --> 01:46:40.970]
fat head. God. He didn't wave to me this morning though. I walked by there and the car was

[01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:45.210]
meant to take a leak and I walked by. Hey, that was Joe on the phone. He was probably cooking up

[01:46:45.210 --> 01:46:50.270]
the next phone he guessed to call in. But please don't tell me that's a humper that my good dear

[01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:56.190]
friend. Hey, Goldberg. Hey, stop it. The man, I mean, who is so this man. And of course he

[01:46:56.190 --> 01:46:59.510]
gets stuff wrong. You know, the Wilk Park thing was funny. He didn't think so. But it was funny

[01:46:59.510 --> 01:47:03.670]
because it's and the reason it was funny was because Hank is the one guy who usually knows this stuff.

[01:47:04.270 --> 01:47:10.790]
That's why it was funny because it was so unusual. But a man who is so meticulous about being on top

[01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:15.390]
of the stuff and not being just another BS artist like Barry Jackass and the morning guys and all

[01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:18.490]
these fat fat fat fat fat. All these guys that talk a lot don't have any sources. Don't know what

[01:47:18.490 --> 01:47:23.750]
they're talking about. A man who is so scrupulous about his reputation as being the sports

[01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:29.850]
naven who can drop more names in a half a minute than you will in the lifetime. And they suck him

[01:47:29.850 --> 01:47:43.010]
into participating in this fraud on this guy damn radio. 1227 and 560 WQAM. Great shoes that fit

[01:47:43.010 --> 01:47:46.930]
right at great prices. Again, I'm talking to you about brand issues of pompano. You know, I'm still

[01:47:46.930 --> 01:47:51.530]
walking around with these silly sandals on because of that little, that little tiny booboo on my big toe.

[01:47:51.730 --> 01:47:55.150]
It's not a big deal. It's healing fine. But when you're diabetic man, if you wear a

[01:47:55.150 --> 01:47:59.590]
stoke shoe and I made a mistake, it's my fault. Two weekends ago, I put on a pair of shoes,

[01:47:59.790 --> 01:48:03.330]
old shoes. They weren't fitting me right. They were like, you're a tape in my feet. And the next

[01:48:03.330 --> 01:48:07.090]
thing you know, I look at my toe and I got a like a bloody toe. I stubbed it and the toe too.

[01:48:07.730 --> 01:48:09.010]
I've had you in this a long time.

[01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:19.710]
Now here's Larry Chang from Italy for Marilyn Quill. Hello. Oh, yes, Larry. I gotta say that you

[01:48:19.710 --> 01:48:23.610]
look great in that miniscord and leather busier. Thank you. Are you wearing any underwear?

[01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:28.810]
No. Well, it's very provocative. You ain't seen nothing yet.

[01:48:29.690 --> 01:48:32.950]
Oh my god. Have you ever seen anything like this?

[01:48:33.610 --> 01:48:38.210]
At the zoo. Put Alicia in that thing and take it for a walk.

[01:48:40.450 --> 01:48:46.510]
385, continues followed by world views after this local commercial break. Next on CNN.

[01:48:47.810 --> 01:48:54.930]
Property to a 560 WQM. A couple open lines. 560, 705, 60, 05, 60 on the mobile one line. Thanks

[01:48:54.930 --> 01:49:00.230]
again to Jeff Cohen for bringing us by a great lunch. How do you like that? Here's the heathen

[01:49:00.230 --> 01:49:06.530]
sitting here eating great stuff. Mots of pizza and Mots of lasagna. I mean, anybody can sit there

[01:49:06.530 --> 01:49:10.970]
eating a crap out of a box. The cardboard with butter and salt on it.

[01:49:13.190 --> 01:49:16.770]
I'm doing the good stuff and these people out there, they're holier than I and didn't go to the game

[01:49:16.770 --> 01:49:23.730]
last night. Nice going. Here's a mobile and curl spring. Hello. Uncle Neil. Yes, sir.

[01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:29.550]
I'm standing here in shame. I was one of the sports morons that fell into Joe Rosa's

[01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:35.070]
rage. I would like to know where all these other people are that got sucked into that and are

[01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:38.350]
pissed off about it or maybe there might even be somebody out there who thought it was funny,

[01:49:38.450 --> 01:49:44.010]
which I did not. No, but I mean, it had, you know, questions and then the hammer came on and

[01:49:44.010 --> 01:49:49.550]
confirmed it with his sources. He really was on and he made up stories about sources. He came on

[01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:54.990]
and said he spoke to John Clayton from ESPN who does all their football inside the huddle. Yeah.

[01:49:54.990 --> 01:50:00.290]
And said that he, you know, he confirmed the trade. It got a little shaky when they interviewed

[01:50:00.290 --> 01:50:05.350]
supposedly Charlie Casterley, the general manager of the Redskins. Yeah. Yeah. That didn't sense,

[01:50:05.690 --> 01:50:11.510]
but I fell right into it. What a embarrassment. What do you mean? I mean, joke. I don't know.

[01:50:11.610 --> 01:50:16.530]
What a joke. I don't know if it's embarrassing or a jerk. Me for believing it or joke for doing it.

[01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:22.090]
Pretty much both. Yeah. But, you know, there's a ghost that I think that's the ultimate act of

[01:50:22.090 --> 01:50:25.170]
desperation. You know, it goes to the show that maybe I'm wrong about guilty. Maybe those two

[01:50:25.170 --> 01:50:29.650]
guys can't do the show without him there. I mean, basically they're my sports. I mean, that's where I

[01:50:29.650 --> 01:50:35.770]
get my sports of states with my work schedule. That's only people I listen to and the state. If I

[01:50:35.770 --> 01:50:39.570]
tune in tomorrow coming to work, if I work coming to our Monday morning and they tell me that Dan

[01:50:39.570 --> 01:50:44.610]
Marino just broke his thumb, I'm not going to believe him. Now, the next time I turn on QAM will not

[01:50:44.610 --> 01:50:51.190]
be until 10 o'clock. Thanks Uncle. Okay. Have a great day, pal. Oh, that was a shot.

[01:50:53.550 --> 01:50:58.150]
Bad judgment, man. It's, you know, one of those risks you take, but boy, that was I think a real,

[01:50:58.150 --> 01:51:05.030]
real bad judgment. You can kiss my rear end. Yeah. Whatever you say. What a suck up job. That was

[01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:11.570]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line. Here is a pompano. Hello.

[01:51:13.470 --> 01:51:16.170]
Anybody with a head that big you think there'd be something inside? Yes, sir.

[01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:19.710]
Hey, I don't, I don't like that. I mean, you don't do that with people's minds. They think

[01:51:19.710 --> 01:51:23.790]
that somebody's going here and someone's going there. Yeah. I mean, Jeff, he must have been going

[01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:28.490]
to trailer park. That's trailer trash mentality. Right. I mean, I don't like it at all. I mean,

[01:51:28.530 --> 01:51:33.390]
I'm sure everybody else that I woke up this morning. Are you pissed off and fired up about it?

[01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:41.110]
Good. That's what I want to hear. That's what I want to hear. I want to hear the truth. I don't

[01:51:41.110 --> 01:51:45.510]
apologize to you. I'd be half of this radio station as marginalized as I apologize. Where's my bumper

[01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:51.870]
sticker that says 5 60 QAM for my car? I want something somebody. The station's going crazy. What's up? I mean,

[01:51:51.870 --> 01:51:57.090]
come on. Now you're getting carried away. Get out of here. This guy thinks we're making bumper

[01:51:57.090 --> 01:52:03.290]
stickers. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line. You'll see the bumper stickers as soon

[01:52:03.290 --> 01:52:07.230]
as you see the billboards that say if you hear it here on QAM, you know, it's a bunch of crap.

[01:52:08.970 --> 01:52:15.790]
As you heard this morning, it's a pile of crap manure. Where we gone? What does that mean? What does that

[01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:23.270]
mean? Waiting? Are you waiting? Neil? Yes, sir. My queen. Yes. Yes. I will cross over. I heard it this

[01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:29.670]
morning, but I knew it was jive because Richmond Web ain't worth 5 million a year. Yes, I know. Okay. But

[01:52:29.670 --> 01:52:35.990]
anyway, he thinks in any way, it was great. Okay. I'm glad it was good for you, sir.

[01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:40.510]
Or ma'am or it or whatever. I think that was it. I think that might have been the thing, the thing

[01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:45.670]
junior. That's that story we were hearing. Oh, yeah. We've heard so many good stories the last few

[01:52:45.670 --> 01:52:50.890]
days about this place. And then my nice chat I had with with good old trouser trout, and especially

[01:52:50.890 --> 01:52:56.670]
my close friend Linda. That's a hockey game last night. I love you, Linda. You know, she walked

[01:52:56.670 --> 01:53:00.090]
up to me. I was sitting there and you know, I should have gotten up and like given her a kiss or

[01:53:00.090 --> 01:53:05.250]
like, you know, something. And I was just so shocked to see. You know what I mean? Kind of like the

[01:53:05.250 --> 01:53:08.650]
day that crystal thinks I shine the red borders that day because I was talking to somebody else and

[01:53:08.650 --> 01:53:12.710]
she hates me like poison. Do it just why she does. Yeah, she does. She loves you. No, she does not.

[01:53:13.110 --> 01:53:18.850]
He hates me. Yeah, she loves the car. Hates me. She thinks I'm a prick. She knows your sweet heart.

[01:53:19.050 --> 01:53:22.830]
No, no, she doesn't. You're a butter muffin. And even little Sabrina, I mean, I'm talking to some

[01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:26.130]
people. I mean, see, you think I'm not a sensitive person. And you're right. I couldn't care less.

[01:53:27.110 --> 01:53:27.950]
But it sounds good.

[01:53:32.130 --> 01:53:35.910]
She only here with Tommy has to say he's probably given us a good crap. What's Tommy Thomas?

[01:53:36.330 --> 01:53:37.710]
Nothing. Oh, it's lots of stuff.

[01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:42.870]
Yeah, right. Likely story. By the way, it was nice. A fat boy to come here and tell us

[01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:50.290]
that was Joe Rose that came up with that stupid idea. 5 6 7 0 5 60, pound 5 60 on a mobile one line.

[01:53:51.450 --> 01:53:57.490]
Here's a mobile in four-later day. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Oh, okay. I'm cool. Neil. Hi. How are you?

[01:53:57.490 --> 01:54:03.710]
Great. The last time I spoke to you, I was raving about Barcelona and you were raving about Amsterdam.

[01:54:03.790 --> 01:54:08.550]
I'm sorry. Yeah, we're not, we're not carrying on the same subject. Obviously that you were just talking about.

[01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:12.770]
Hey, we're talking about whatever you want, sir. Don't leave that. Whatever you would like to talk about.

[01:54:12.770 --> 01:54:15.690]
We don't have to talk about dumb sports crap all day. I hate sports crap.

[01:54:16.450 --> 01:54:21.610]
Okay, I understand. I'm tired of these sports nerds that have no lives that don't know what the real world is all about.

[01:54:21.810 --> 01:54:24.790]
Think that Richmond and his wicked web is important or something. Who cares?

[01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:31.430]
I don't even know. I'm holding. I'm holding number 78. Oh, I'm so tired of that. Richmond. They have a

[01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:37.870]
set him to Richmond. Well, let me tell you my impression of Amsterdam. Yes. My impressions are it's like a big college

[01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:44.750]
town. It's, uh, look, you know, you may have a great time when you go there, but I'll tell you something.

[01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:50.250]
I went there for the money three months, took the money and ran. You stay in that town so long

[01:54:50.250 --> 01:54:55.510]
you'll become a skeleton drug addict. No, you won't. Oh, yeah. It's a sick place.

[01:54:55.730 --> 01:54:59.110]
Well, no, no, it's not. What do you mean you become a skeleton drug addict? What does that mean?

[01:54:59.510 --> 01:55:07.650]
Well, I mean, just, you know, it's got the legal drugs that are available there as the illegal drugs that are available there.

[01:55:07.690 --> 01:55:12.650]
So they're not available here? No, of course they are. I mean, so how come you're not running down in

[01:55:12.650 --> 01:55:17.370]
the overtime buying coke right now, buying crack coke, and how could you say that?

[01:55:17.370 --> 01:55:22.470]
I've been to Amsterdam 50 or 60 times and I don't do any drugs. I couldn't careily defend me that those

[01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:27.730]
sparsers come up to me. Those raster guys, crock, coke, you know, I don't like that. Oh, no, no, no, no.

[01:55:27.770 --> 01:55:33.870]
You know, in Amsterdam, it's very civilized. You know, you have your guy. He comes. He delivers whatever.

[01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:38.590]
You know, I mean, it's not like overtime. It's nothing like that. We're talking here about

[01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:43.290]
people who who make substantial amounts. I would like with all due respect. How many times you've

[01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:47.110]
been there? That's the only time? I'm sorry? That's the only time you've ever been there? Oh, no,

[01:55:47.230 --> 01:55:50.550]
I've been there about three or four times. Well, why if it's so bad? Why do you keep going? Well, you're

[01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:55.790]
usually it's business. Oh, you're she is business. Listen, this one could be at there. There's no doubt about it.

[01:55:55.810 --> 01:56:00.210]
Because the overwhelming majority of people I see in Amsterdam aren't doing any drugs. Most of the

[01:56:00.210 --> 01:56:04.730]
people that are smoking pot and hash are in the in the bars and cafes and the people are doing the

[01:56:04.730 --> 01:56:07.830]
illegal stuff. They're not doing it except for the pedaling of it. They're not doing it on the

[01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:15.530]
street. So what's the difference? Is it who cares? Well, my impression was that if you stay there

[01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:22.050]
for a longer time, you're really at the way. I could live there tomorrow from my mouth to God's

[01:56:22.050 --> 01:56:26.190]
ears. I could move there tomorrow and I guarantee you I would never become. You skeleton or otherwise.

[01:56:26.330 --> 01:56:31.670]
I have no interest in drugs. You didn't, well, you didn't find it that it's a very small town. I mean,

[01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:40.670]
the culture quotient is a scale of one to ten. It's about a two. That's not true. The culture quotient,

[01:56:40.770 --> 01:56:44.050]
there's more culture in the Anne Frank museum than there is in all of South Florida.

[01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:49.150]
Well, well, well. Oh, well, there you go. Okay, fell asleep in Barcelona. Get out of here.

[01:56:49.490 --> 01:56:53.530]
Well, what is this? If you didn't like it, though, don't go there. That's all. Don't go there.

[01:56:56.710 --> 01:57:02.610]
Boy, the culture level. They got museums. They got art. They got the glass bottom. Both. You can see the

[01:57:02.610 --> 01:57:06.710]
murky dirty water in the canal. Whatever you want. They got it there. It's a great place. It's a

[01:57:06.710 --> 01:57:13.350]
fun place to go. This guy don't like having fun. He's busy doing his crack cocaine. Okay.

[01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:23.510]
Twenty before one is five sixty WQM. You know, we ate it pizza love. So boy, I'm serious. Am I going to

[01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:28.750]
call up Ed Kaplan on the hotline? See what the odds are. I'm at. You know, that song working my

[01:57:28.750 --> 01:57:35.950]
way out of you by the four seasons. I thought with the SPN the magazine is John Quayton and he confirmed it.

[01:57:36.090 --> 01:57:37.790]
Why are you airing shit like this?

[01:57:49.470 --> 01:57:58.890]
Five hits and I'm weak. It mellows me out for the piece I see. Like that ball. Here I go again.

[01:57:58.890 --> 01:58:09.470]
I got a bunch. He's makes me want to smack and then I lie down going to take him down and then I'll get up and I make the

[01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:16.710]
tracks a couple of toasts and the fun is coming back. Now I get a thrill and I roll that weed off the

[01:58:16.710 --> 01:58:19.110]
pop. My favorite. You see. Okay.

[01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:53.850]
Yeah, I'm going to tell you you can't spend more than five seconds and I'm still I'm

[01:58:53.850 --> 01:59:00.330]
without becoming like a what was the term you used a what drug addict skinny skinny outless drug addict.

[01:59:01.190 --> 01:59:05.530]
I mean, how do you spend more than five minutes in Miami if being around a place where drugs are

[01:59:05.530 --> 01:59:09.110]
available is what makes you a drug addict. Then why do you ever have to leave Miami? Do you have to

[01:59:09.110 --> 01:59:15.810]
leave? No. What an idiotic piece of illogic that is. So for whatever reason, I mean if this guy

[01:59:15.810 --> 01:59:22.030]
don't like it there, fine. He's entitled. We can live without him. But I mean, to be reaching for

[01:59:22.030 --> 01:59:26.530]
reasons that you don't like a place that's just astonishing to me. But what do I know? What does

[01:59:26.530 --> 01:59:30.850]
this look like me know? I know we got plenty of open lines. We got an hour and a quarter to kill here.

[01:59:31.250 --> 01:59:37.630]
5 6 7 0 5 60. Palm 5 60 on the mobile one line. Joseph abandoned us because it's more important to

[01:59:37.630 --> 01:59:42.470]
the pock ski around with a with a matza and with a horse radish and with a little parsley in the

[01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:48.110]
saltwater and poxed your mind with all these things. I'm small potatoes. They can come back to me

[01:59:48.110 --> 01:59:53.390]
anytime and I'll still be here, right? No. Here's a mobile and four-loader, Neil. Hello. Hey,

[01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:58.010]
Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, listen, I tell you why. That's for being a voice of reason. As far as those two

[01:59:58.010 --> 02:00:04.390]
jerks this morning. Yes. Talk about bad days. I'm God damn pissed off. Good. This this whole community

[02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:09.330]
we're not even out in the night even over with that pop face that's what and they do something like

[02:00:09.330 --> 02:00:15.270]
this. What a bunch of junk. God damn it. Right. Well, no, I'm really surprised that Hank took a hand in

[02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:20.790]
this. Yeah. I don't ever turn on that radio. We just got that tape there and just played it. But

[02:00:20.790 --> 02:00:24.530]
even I that had to be bogus. Somebody must have been doing hangs boys. There's no way that a man who

[02:00:24.530 --> 02:00:28.370]
cares about integrity and credibility and being on top of the sports world, which I know is one of

[02:00:28.370 --> 02:00:32.730]
the most important things. Thanks. There's no way a guy like that participates in a bogus, a dumb

[02:00:32.730 --> 02:00:37.750]
April fool stunt like that. Hey, listen, I want to thank Joe and Diva for making my 13-year-old son

[02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:43.990]
cry. Okay. Okay. God bless you, sir. And the guy that lost the 300 bucks. Sounds like good

[02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:47.970]
fodder for a bunch of lawsuits. By the way, Joe Rose. That's the guy you want to be soon. Okay. He

[02:00:47.970 --> 02:00:53.230]
was the one. He was the root of all evil this morning. That's what happens when you put a bunch of

[02:00:53.230 --> 02:00:58.310]
thickheaded jocks with a big, big skull on, you know, put them on here. And we were going to pay

[02:00:58.310 --> 02:01:03.530]
Orange, Bomardi 80 grand a year. We want to do a pregame show and talk of boobani's before ball

[02:01:03.530 --> 02:01:09.330]
games. Then nobody listens to anyway. Maybe he's joining the inner circle, Orange,

[02:01:09.410 --> 02:01:14.350]
Bomardi for all we know. Maybe he's real tight with the screw in and some of those other folks

[02:01:14.350 --> 02:01:19.130]
in the back there and the other side of the building. I think it's really interesting that if you

[02:01:19.130 --> 02:01:22.590]
could see the way we are here, another we're on the third floor, but there is definitely a great

[02:01:22.590 --> 02:01:33.510]
divide between the QAM studio is including this one all on the one side of a certain wall. And then

[02:01:33.510 --> 02:01:38.030]
all over on the other side, the water Nazi, the big shot, the big cheese with the bad haircut,

[02:01:38.810 --> 02:01:43.830]
all those people screw in. Also, I was speaking to the person in question who actually has the

[02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:49.690]
Snickers bars. Yes. About that story. Yes. To confirm it. She apparently had no idea how expensive it

[02:01:49.690 --> 02:01:56.690]
was because he'd go in there while she's gone with his key. Jeff, hi. Right. Back boy. We don't

[02:01:56.690 --> 02:02:00.550]
want to tell the story anywhere. His son who's a nice kid, by the way, who's in town from school.

[02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:05.290]
Did he go in here this morning? I know we don't want to talk about that. I know because Jeff,

[02:02:05.690 --> 02:02:10.190]
unfortunately, see when mommy and daddy eat a lot, then the kids tend to eat a lot too. You know?

[02:02:10.750 --> 02:02:16.410]
And it's very, it's sad, but his kid seems like a nice kid. So I sure hope that he isn't here.

[02:02:16.490 --> 02:02:20.750]
The daddy is so compulsive with his eating that he's swiping Snickers bars out of the sales office

[02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:26.130]
and using his pass key to smuggle his way in there to steal the power and it's not even a QAM thing.

[02:02:26.130 --> 02:02:31.390]
He don't work for Power 96. He's going over there at Steeland Power 96 Snickers bar. Huh?

[02:02:32.250 --> 02:02:36.910]
I'm a sniggering just thinking about it. Don't get excited where I said sniggering.

[02:02:37.530 --> 02:02:42.350]
Here's a mobile and pompato beach. Hello. I think if you get that Dennis to go to that

[02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:48.330]
Joe Rose, take that quarter inch gap to six suck in there. Dig it right up. You know why?

[02:02:48.330 --> 02:02:55.190]
Brackum. All right. And I tell you that was Hank. No. And I tell you another thing about your buddy,

[02:02:55.190 --> 02:03:01.510]
Hank. Yeah. He talked about him. I see highly a horse track. He'll never go back there. Yeah.

[02:03:01.970 --> 02:03:07.970]
The reason is because he cut in front of line about one minute to post and they want to get his fat ass out of there.

[02:03:08.370 --> 02:03:08.750]
Oh.

[02:03:15.170 --> 02:03:21.250]
Hey stupid. Open line two of five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line.

[02:03:22.650 --> 02:03:26.450]
Course depth out of time. You know, this place at the under control if we had our program director

[02:03:26.450 --> 02:03:30.730]
to keep things keep everybody in line. But he goes out of town for a few days and everybody's going

[02:03:30.730 --> 02:03:33.870]
nuts. By the way, does deaf know I'm not going to be here tomorrow?

[02:03:34.850 --> 02:03:37.770]
Sam will tell them they're calling. What is it? You have better call them up and let them know.

[02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:43.010]
Sam will tell them. See, oh, I'd buy it away. Do you remember? I forgot to mention this on here.

[02:03:43.090 --> 02:03:46.790]
Remember I talked a couple of days ago. I did not make it up about how we got billed for direct

[02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:50.690]
TV for like 83 bucks because the bill they thought was passed to. Well, it comes to find out

[02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:54.790]
amazingly enough because this place that they ever do pay a bill. It's a miracle. So it's like a

[02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:59.190]
boy who cried wolf story when they do pay one. But evidently, there was confusion because your name

[02:03:59.190 --> 02:04:03.050]
and my name was on a one bill and then they had the station, but they had evidently paid it a

[02:04:03.050 --> 02:04:09.370]
couple of months ago. So guess who came in Monday to tell us the real story on that?

[02:04:11.670 --> 02:04:15.550]
Sam, you see because that was the day that Greg was home sick. You know, after I called him on

[02:04:15.550 --> 02:04:18.710]
Friday, he heard about the phones and he had to go home with a bad headache and his mono finally

[02:04:18.710 --> 02:04:23.570]
kicked in because he couldn't deal with face to face. Sam the sham. So in other words, when deaf is

[02:04:23.570 --> 02:04:30.850]
gone and Greg is gone, Sam is the general manager. Are you ready for that? Yes, Sam the sham runs

[02:04:30.850 --> 02:04:35.430]
the place. You just figured that out. No, but I never had the Peckery order in line like that.

[02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:40.190]
But he's like the third Pecker. Then if you would like another club, please. Why he's not not getting

[02:04:40.190 --> 02:04:45.510]
business. No, there's no Julio's over there. Apparently. So he's not giving away Marlon tickets. I can't

[02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:49.710]
believe it. Nobody's there. Three tickets to the Marlon's opening day game on Monday and Tuesday night,

[02:04:49.790 --> 02:04:54.150]
H&R Block night. See the Marlon's in the Metz five. Your tax is free from H&R Block at the ballpark.

[02:04:54.150 --> 02:04:58.930]
If you like why do they're there because H&R Block will be doing that. And Chris Reed has got the WQM

[02:04:58.930 --> 02:05:03.370]
fan out there at the Shell Gas Station University in Broward Northeast corner plantation with free

[02:05:03.370 --> 02:05:07.070]
Marlon's tickets and nobody wants them for crying out loud because there's no fix up there.

[02:05:07.150 --> 02:05:09.690]
It's wrong with you people up there in my neck of the woods in plantation.

[02:05:10.890 --> 02:05:15.030]
Then we got to get yesterday boy down there with a Julio land in Dade County and they snapped

[02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:19.710]
them off. He was gone in 20 minutes. Got to do a second plug on this today. And that was always

[02:05:19.710 --> 02:05:24.090]
a big location for us up there. And what? They have the new QA and bumper stickers there too.

[02:05:24.090 --> 02:05:33.590]
Yeah right. They do. What is this another April Fools? You didn't see those? No. They're a plastic.

[02:05:34.570 --> 02:05:41.870]
What a big are they? So my keen size they say WQM sports radio they don't mention you

[02:05:41.870 --> 02:05:47.430]
or what? Wait a minute WQM sports radio doesn't mention neo-rogers. Do they have anything that

[02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:51.730]
mentions neo-rogers? No. No. Anything that mentions that there's an entertaining show with big ratings

[02:05:51.730 --> 02:06:00.730]
on this station? Oh. Oh there's one. They suck. They suck, Sam. Sports radio. That sucks.

[02:06:02.910 --> 02:06:09.250]
That blows. Look at the look on his face. And he thinks we're going to believe you serious.

[02:06:09.570 --> 02:06:13.610]
Like what the hell does it make? What we think? We don't count. So they can sell with us about

[02:06:13.610 --> 02:06:17.430]
anything. We don't even like I said we're a non show anyway. We don't exist here. We're just

[02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:22.730]
here to make all the money so they can pay Wayne. That's why we're here. They finally got

[02:06:22.730 --> 02:06:26.190]
bumper stickers. Are they bumper stickers that have anything to do? I mean could they have somehow

[02:06:26.190 --> 02:06:31.250]
incorporated us into that? No. That's all right. We'll sum up. We'll scrape by any house, Sam.

[02:06:31.390 --> 02:06:35.510]
Don't worry about us. What's the same came up with that idea and probably pushed it through to

[02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:43.870]
even charge now? No Greg, no Duff, no screw in. Here's a mobile informer. Hello? Yes, Neil. Yes sir.

[02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:50.010]
Yes, those people call all those sports shows that they need to get a life. That's right. Exactly.

[02:06:50.230 --> 02:06:55.590]
I couldn't have said it better myself. Yeah, I've offered her. It's just that whole mentality.

[02:06:55.770 --> 02:07:02.370]
It's just unbelievable to me. But the main reason I'm calling is because we have a reason now

[02:07:02.370 --> 02:07:06.650]
to turn on the radio first thing in the morning over here. Yes, I've been times for a day and

[02:07:07.250 --> 02:07:14.570]
on what station? 94.5. All right. Aren't they great? They are fabulous. I heard them up in

[02:07:14.570 --> 02:07:18.770]
Indianapolis when I was up there up here. They're famous. But yeah, they sound great.

[02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:22.790]
I mean, all the time great morning shows in America, Bob and Tom, you got it. Yes, sir.

[02:07:22.970 --> 02:07:27.410]
You know, now we got a little competition for Howard over here. They absolutely blow Howard away.

[02:07:27.550 --> 02:07:31.910]
No, no, no, no, no, no contest. Yes, sir. So I just want to call and let you know that.

[02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:37.090]
Congratulations, sir. Have a good one. Happy day. Like saving time. You just bye.

[02:07:38.590 --> 02:07:41.550]
Okay, so anyway, I mentioned that he was out there at the Shell Station University in

[02:07:41.550 --> 02:07:45.650]
Howard. So nobody wants to borrow them tickets. We tried giving my personal pair away yesterday.

[02:07:45.930 --> 02:07:50.910]
We had a drawing and we had like five people that wanted in the drawing. We took names for like an

[02:07:50.910 --> 02:07:55.650]
hour and a half and only five people wanted to be on the list for the drawing. They don't want them.

[02:07:56.250 --> 02:08:00.530]
I don't want to make John Henry feel bad unless I have to. But hey, guess what, John?

[02:08:01.110 --> 02:08:05.190]
And let me say it again, mad dog, you're absolutely wrong. You're a great guy. I respect you,

[02:08:05.310 --> 02:08:10.430]
tell him more than anybody in the world. You're hysterical. You're a panic. But oh, and by the way,

[02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:14.730]
I noticed how he's backtracking after Michigan made that great comeback in one of the bowl game

[02:08:14.730 --> 02:08:18.610]
and he was going on about, oh, Tommy Brady, they finally found a quarterback. This kid is for real.

[02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:22.190]
Now he's talking about Michigan quarterbacks and he's like, you know, he finally admits,

[02:08:22.630 --> 02:08:26.810]
Tommy Brady was too pretty to be on a quarterback of Michigan, you know, you don't like that.

[02:08:27.370 --> 02:08:30.990]
The real macho sports guys, they don't like pretty boys being quarterback like Tommy Brady.

[02:08:32.330 --> 02:08:36.450]
That's all right. It's not just the one to two hour. It's a phenomenon.

[02:08:36.930 --> 02:08:42.550]
Wow, your fat ass is really comfortable. Wow, your fat ass is doing wonders for my fat back.

[02:08:42.730 --> 02:08:45.050]
Want to do something useful with your fat ass?

[02:08:45.230 --> 02:08:47.470]
You can sleep on your fat ass all day.

[02:08:47.850 --> 02:08:49.010]
Then why not put it to use?

[02:08:49.370 --> 02:08:51.850]
And you don't want if my girlfriend sits on your fat ass too, do you?

[02:08:51.850 --> 02:08:56.730]
As one of America's newest ask cushions, put your fat ass to use for the airline

[02:08:56.730 --> 02:08:59.470]
and turn a coat seat into comfort class.

[02:08:59.690 --> 02:09:02.890]
This is great by letting people sit on your fat ass.

[02:09:03.130 --> 02:09:08.290]
You'll be helping to improve people's days on the bus at the movie theater, even at the park.

[02:09:08.490 --> 02:09:11.470]
Mommy, come close on this fat ass with me.

[02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:15.530]
Put your fat ass to work today. Receive hourly wages, health benefits,

[02:09:15.990 --> 02:09:19.630]
and whole host. Call now and be proud to be a fat ass.

[02:09:20.130 --> 02:09:22.650]
OK, it's 101 at 560 W. Don't forget.

[02:09:23.010 --> 02:09:25.730]
Pistols get me fired up when I hear someone say that.

[02:09:25.730 --> 02:09:27.770]
The audience and a friend who got some good fangs is by the way.

[02:09:27.810 --> 02:09:30.450]
Here's one that says to Jeff Rose and Jeff DeFloris.

[02:09:30.870 --> 02:09:32.750]
Phil Henry doesn't work in this market anymore.

[02:09:32.850 --> 02:09:34.010]
You don't have the talent to do this.

[02:09:34.270 --> 02:09:35.270]
OK, that's what it says.

[02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:37.970]
Also, here's one from Carolyn who says,

[02:09:38.130 --> 02:09:41.610]
yes, the old Hanks, you were called in and said he would check with the SPN news

[02:09:41.610 --> 02:09:43.030]
and confirm the story and so on.

[02:09:43.170 --> 02:09:44.430]
So I'm sure she was sucked in.

[02:09:44.570 --> 02:09:45.250]
So are we, Carolyn?

[02:09:45.570 --> 02:09:48.550]
We're embarrassed that it took place on a otherwise marginal radio station.

[02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:52.990]
We're highly embarrassed and humiliated and degraded and desperate.

[02:09:53.370 --> 02:09:54.830]
Must be desperate in that morning show.

[02:09:55.230 --> 02:09:55.690]
Chris has gone.

[02:09:56.410 --> 02:09:57.870]
So in other words, he gave away the ticket.

[02:09:58.010 --> 02:10:00.950]
Let's see, we know Chris that you're just sucking around trying to make

[02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:01.950]
us feel bad.

[02:10:02.150 --> 02:10:03.950]
We know that just because we said you were boring.

[02:10:04.710 --> 02:10:05.450]
You are boring.

[02:10:05.550 --> 02:10:06.050]
You're a good guy.

[02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:07.670]
See, some people they never get enough.

[02:10:08.290 --> 02:10:09.190]
You're a good guy.

[02:10:09.310 --> 02:10:10.150]
Everybody here likes you.

[02:10:10.230 --> 02:10:11.530]
You're a great guy, but you're boring.

[02:10:12.650 --> 02:10:15.990]
You want us also to say you look great and you're like exciting, huh?

[02:10:16.770 --> 02:10:17.470]
But he knows that.

[02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:18.050]
Right.

[02:10:18.730 --> 02:10:21.410]
So don't take it on me just because your buddy Sam is in there

[02:10:21.410 --> 02:10:25.970]
pounding now because of those really unbelievably ugly and unimaginative bumpers

[02:10:25.970 --> 02:10:26.230]
stickers.

[02:10:27.130 --> 02:10:30.210]
I mean, it takes quite a promotion department to come up with everything for this

[02:10:30.210 --> 02:10:31.790]
place looks exactly the same.

[02:10:31.950 --> 02:10:34.750]
The same blue background with ugly yellow letters.

[02:10:35.010 --> 02:10:35.510]
That's it.

[02:10:35.970 --> 02:10:36.830]
Nothing imaginative.

[02:10:37.090 --> 02:10:38.270]
Nobody's names, of course.

[02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:38.850]
God forbid.

[02:10:39.770 --> 02:10:41.310]
I mean, at least put the inner circle on there.

[02:10:41.410 --> 02:10:44.590]
Put Gary Sarner, screw in, the water Nazi, Greg Reed.

[02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:45.930]
Put the inner circle on there.

[02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:47.130]
The nephew of Sam.

[02:10:47.790 --> 02:10:52.050]
Somebody something beside that same ugly meaningless nothing.

[02:10:53.470 --> 02:10:55.450]
Okay, we got 56 minutes to go here.

[02:10:55.570 --> 02:10:58.190]
We got 1,600 open lines, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:10:58.910 --> 02:11:01.110]
Oh, yeah, we did have the one call on Paiser Dickey Candy.

[02:11:01.250 --> 02:11:01.850]
Thank you, sweetheart.

[02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:05.050]
The one nice Jewish lady call to explain that to us about the corn syrup.

[02:11:07.470 --> 02:11:08.510]
Here's the mobile in Miami.

[02:11:08.690 --> 02:11:08.850]
Hello.

[02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:11.170]
Mobile in Miami.

[02:11:12.330 --> 02:11:13.010]
Going once.

[02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:15.210]
Why is it maybe set line four?

[02:11:15.370 --> 02:11:16.010]
Could it be line four?

[02:11:16.570 --> 02:11:17.410]
Yeah, been the line.

[02:11:17.530 --> 02:11:18.630]
It always seems to happen on that line.

[02:11:19.050 --> 02:11:20.610]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[02:11:20.730 --> 02:11:20.830]
Hello.

[02:11:21.570 --> 02:11:22.250]
Hello, Neil.

[02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:22.670]
Yes, sir.

[02:11:23.170 --> 02:11:25.570]
Hey, about that episode this morning.

[02:11:25.790 --> 02:11:25.910]
Yes.

[02:11:26.130 --> 02:11:28.570]
You know, being aware that it's the April 1st,

[02:11:28.630 --> 02:11:31.230]
April Fool's Day, I figured out the first thing we tried something.

[02:11:31.690 --> 02:11:32.530]
It was a joke.

[02:11:32.650 --> 02:11:34.630]
As soon as they said it, I knew it was a bunch of bull.

[02:11:34.910 --> 02:11:39.930]
But when Shank Goldberg is on there to verify that.

[02:11:40.390 --> 02:11:45.130]
That's when I was telling my friends that Hank doesn't come on to tell his story.

[02:11:45.130 --> 02:11:46.750]
You know, this is a bunch of bull.

[02:11:47.450 --> 02:11:47.810]
Sure.

[02:11:48.070 --> 02:11:49.410]
When he came on, we all had it.

[02:11:49.530 --> 02:11:52.250]
We all were hooked, basically, because he confirmed it.

[02:11:52.750 --> 02:11:55.990]
And you thought the credibility that he has, which is he really going to go on.

[02:11:56.010 --> 02:11:56.530]
Yes, he's got the whole.

[02:11:56.530 --> 02:11:56.750]
Oh my God.

[02:11:57.130 --> 02:12:01.050]
That's the reason because Hank is the only one of that whole bunch that's got any credibility.

[02:12:01.530 --> 02:12:03.950]
And for him to be willing to lower himself to that level,

[02:12:03.970 --> 02:12:07.710]
because those guys are so desperate and join in on that facade.

[02:12:08.550 --> 02:12:09.570]
And ain't good, man.

[02:12:10.030 --> 02:12:10.430]
It's unacceptable.

[02:12:11.290 --> 02:12:11.950]
And I'll say what?

[02:12:12.170 --> 02:12:14.810]
When the respect for Hank is definitely dropped.

[02:12:14.810 --> 02:12:17.170]
Not just by me, but generally public.

[02:12:17.470 --> 02:12:18.450]
I've got to listen to that.

[02:12:18.710 --> 02:12:23.310]
Listen to him and think, and you know, he usually has the right stories that can get some quick.

[02:12:23.850 --> 02:12:27.470]
What the heck would you be doing getting in that in the middle of that charade?

[02:12:27.590 --> 02:12:27.750]
Right.

[02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:28.770]
And I think you're right.

[02:12:28.930 --> 02:12:30.830]
It's just a bad judge on the time.

[02:12:31.070 --> 02:12:33.510]
Sometimes you make good judgements, sometimes make bad ones,

[02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:35.450]
but that was a bad mistake, Humper.

[02:12:35.970 --> 02:12:36.170]
Yeah.

[02:12:36.330 --> 02:12:38.310]
And it's just a few George Back at you.

[02:12:38.590 --> 02:12:38.870]
Okay.

[02:12:40.010 --> 02:12:40.450]
What?

[02:12:41.210 --> 02:12:42.050]
Let's just see.

[02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:42.770]
Oh.

[02:12:43.210 --> 02:12:44.130]
And he confirmed it.

[02:12:46.770 --> 02:12:47.130]
56670560.

[02:12:47.970 --> 02:12:48.330]
0560.

[02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:50.690]
Yeah, Shuse Steve calling it about Hank's credibility.

[02:12:51.630 --> 02:12:52.250]
You're a good wonder.

[02:12:52.410 --> 02:12:54.410]
You even have credibility as a human being, Shuse Steve.

[02:12:55.310 --> 02:12:56.010]
What am I looking for?

[02:12:56.110 --> 02:12:56.970]
Oh, I know what I'm looking for.

[02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:58.390]
This is the wrong thing too well.

[02:12:58.510 --> 02:12:58.890]
It's in the thing.

[02:12:59.350 --> 02:12:59.650]
What is?

[02:13:00.270 --> 02:13:01.030]
Or whatever you're looking for.

[02:13:03.890 --> 02:13:04.670]
It's in the thing.

[02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:06.610]
And you've been to several places for spring train.

[02:13:07.250 --> 02:13:11.450]
I know, but I remember I go back a long way to when the Yankees first came down here.

[02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:14.210]
And they had trained all those years in St. Petersburg.

[02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:17.230]
And what a culture shock it was for them to leave St.

[02:13:17.610 --> 02:13:18.950]
Petersburg and come to Fort Lodervo.

[02:13:19.050 --> 02:13:21.970]
Which at that time was where spring break was happening.

[02:13:22.270 --> 02:13:22.650]
And in St.

[02:13:22.770 --> 02:13:24.250]
Petersburg, you know what was happening there.

[02:13:24.490 --> 02:13:26.730]
You've been to spring train in that city.

[02:13:26.850 --> 02:13:27.830]
There was nothing there, right?

[02:13:29.110 --> 02:13:31.390]
Well, I was in poor Charlotte for five years.

[02:13:32.930 --> 02:13:34.330]
Did you ever go to St.

[02:13:34.710 --> 02:13:34.710]

[02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:35.510]
Nope.

[02:13:36.010 --> 02:13:37.170]
For spring training, never did?

[02:13:37.410 --> 02:13:37.670]
Nope.

[02:13:37.930 --> 02:13:38.150]
Nope.

[02:13:38.770 --> 02:13:39.990]
But nine years before that,

[02:13:41.970 --> 02:13:44.830]
Arizona, yeah, right with the Giants.

[02:13:45.130 --> 02:13:48.470]
How is it coming over to the American League?

[02:13:48.670 --> 02:13:49.650]
You looking forward to it?

[02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:52.370]
Been in the American League for five years now.

[02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:53.110]
Yeah.

[02:13:53.270 --> 02:13:56.810]
So I'm not unfamiliar with it.

[02:13:56.830 --> 02:13:59.270]
I'm looking forward to just starting with an interview.

[02:14:01.590 --> 02:14:03.730]
That was, hey, it's been a stressful way, Frank.

[02:14:03.810 --> 02:14:05.450]
He'll be here in the studio in the building.

[02:14:05.450 --> 02:14:08.910]
So maybe he'll stop in for a minute and explain to us that it was somebody doing a voice.

[02:14:08.910 --> 02:14:10.170]
Hey, he couldn't, he would never.

[02:14:10.350 --> 02:14:12.690]
I know Hank too many years and one thing I know about him.

[02:14:12.870 --> 02:14:15.030]
His credibility on the sports stuff is like,

[02:14:15.390 --> 02:14:15.830]
that's it.

[02:14:15.950 --> 02:14:17.150]
That's the most important thing in the world.

[02:14:17.290 --> 02:14:20.470]
And it would never participate in some childish idiotic prank

[02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:22.790]
just to boost up the ego of fathead during the morning.

[02:14:24.810 --> 02:14:28.390]
So the deal is, by the way, they won't let Chris read out of the parking lot.

[02:14:28.450 --> 02:14:31.350]
They're at the shell station because they know he's holding back all his other Marlon tickets.

[02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:33.250]
Don't let him out of there, guy.

[02:14:33.330 --> 02:14:33.950]
He's got him.

[02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:37.130]
He showed me at like 600 pair before we left here.

[02:14:37.530 --> 02:14:39.010]
Don't let him make up stories.

[02:14:39.270 --> 02:14:40.650]
Okay, that he's waiting for Cubans or whatever.

[02:14:40.930 --> 02:14:42.670]
Or that Sam told him, you only give away so many.

[02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:45.630]
You make sure you get your tickets before you leave that parking lot.

[02:14:46.890 --> 02:14:47.950]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:14:47.950 --> 02:14:48.310]
Hello.

[02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:49.470]
From here.

[02:14:49.710 --> 02:14:50.070]
Yes, sir.

[02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:53.410]
Yeah, I was at Fairchild's tropical gardens on Tuesday.

[02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:54.110]
Yeah.

[02:14:54.590 --> 02:14:55.910]
And I was walking to have you been there?

[02:14:56.230 --> 02:14:58.610]
No, this time I was looking out to mix up all the silly stories.

[02:14:58.770 --> 02:14:58.850]
Yeah.

[02:14:59.430 --> 02:15:00.150]
Well, yes.

[02:15:00.670 --> 02:15:04.390]
Okay, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 and pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless lines.

[02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:06.070]
You only took me about eight months.

[02:15:06.250 --> 02:15:08.050]
Is that all it took just to be absolutely sure?

[02:15:08.350 --> 02:15:09.370]
You would own your little silly stories.

[02:15:09.690 --> 02:15:11.950]
Probably some old gray hair lady with a fish boot up a race.

[02:15:12.090 --> 02:15:13.970]
Is that what you ran into at whatever it was?

[02:15:15.290 --> 02:15:16.630]
Here's a mobile in four-lotterdale.

[02:15:16.630 --> 02:15:16.890]
Hello.

[02:15:17.870 --> 02:15:18.230]
Neil.

[02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:19.410]
God, those guys are boring.

[02:15:19.550 --> 02:15:20.370]
Those three little Julios.

[02:15:20.370 --> 02:15:20.890]
They're there.

[02:15:21.050 --> 02:15:21.470]
So boring.

[02:15:21.570 --> 02:15:21.870]
Yes, sir.

[02:15:22.250 --> 02:15:23.010]
First time long time.

[02:15:23.130 --> 02:15:23.450]
All right.

[02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:24.230]
All right.

[02:15:24.710 --> 02:15:29.190]
Just let me know about half a minute after you mentioned that Chris was at the guy fishing

[02:15:29.190 --> 02:15:29.690]
on the shell.

[02:15:29.870 --> 02:15:30.050]
Yeah.

[02:15:30.270 --> 02:15:31.570]
About 10 cars pulled in.

[02:15:32.070 --> 02:15:33.810]
And he was wondering where the hell he was coming from.

[02:15:33.810 --> 02:15:35.410]
I didn't think he was listening to your show.

[02:15:35.950 --> 02:15:36.710]
But I want to thank you.

[02:15:36.730 --> 02:15:38.290]
I got one of these ugly bumper stickers.

[02:15:38.570 --> 02:15:38.690]
Right.

[02:15:38.890 --> 02:15:39.310]
No, no, no.

[02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.490]
I'm waiting.

[02:15:39.670 --> 02:15:42.710]
When you would, when you agree with me that those are the most unimaginative,

[02:15:42.910 --> 02:15:44.210]
boring, bland, bumper stickers.

[02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:45.470]
Not that I want to pull words in your mouth.

[02:15:45.570 --> 02:15:46.290]
But isn't it pretty boring?

[02:15:46.670 --> 02:15:48.110]
Boring is, I'm not going to put this on my car.

[02:15:48.230 --> 02:15:49.050]
Well, what does it say?

[02:15:49.550 --> 02:15:51.090]
It says 5, 60, 4th.

[02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:51.590]
There it is.

[02:15:51.770 --> 02:15:53.090]
Sports Radio 5, 60, WBQ.

[02:15:53.310 --> 02:15:56.790]
The same boring logo that we got on everything that the station has got, which isn't much.

[02:15:57.130 --> 02:15:59.370]
I mean, instead of coming up with something innovative or neat,

[02:15:59.650 --> 02:16:01.850]
it might say the worst team and Neil and Hank Rios.

[02:16:01.850 --> 02:16:04.510]
Something just the same bland boring crap.

[02:16:04.890 --> 02:16:05.530]
I agree.

[02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:06.590]
That's Sam, man.

[02:16:06.750 --> 02:16:10.290]
I, he was starting to move up in my eyes and now he just dropped 20 nods.

[02:16:10.830 --> 02:16:12.110]
Can I call it the pure douchebag?

[02:16:12.190 --> 02:16:12.550]
Yes, sir.

[02:16:12.970 --> 02:16:14.030]
Little rather you got the douchebag.

[02:16:14.210 --> 02:16:14.470]
All right.

[02:16:14.630 --> 02:16:14.990]
See your pal.

[02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:17.770]
See there was a million people over there.

[02:16:17.890 --> 02:16:20.430]
And Sam, you know, Sam heard me knock the bumper stickers right away called

[02:16:20.430 --> 02:16:22.230]
Chris on the shortwave or whatever.

[02:16:23.090 --> 02:16:23.750]
Yeah, look at that.

[02:16:23.950 --> 02:16:25.910]
That is the crappiest looking thing.

[02:16:27.010 --> 02:16:29.190]
Maybe we have to like pencil our names in on there.

[02:16:31.230 --> 02:16:33.050]
Yeah, get a magic marker and put, you know,

[02:16:33.170 --> 02:16:34.610]
Neil Roger show 10 to 2.

[02:16:35.330 --> 02:16:37.070]
Hank Goldberg to the 6th.

[02:16:37.070 --> 02:16:39.130]
The embarrassing show 6 to 10 in the morning.

[02:16:40.190 --> 02:16:41.050]
You'll fat head.

[02:16:41.770 --> 02:16:43.110]
Here's a mobile implantation.

[02:16:43.210 --> 02:16:43.370]
Hello.

[02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:44.830]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:45.350]
Okay, sir.

[02:16:45.850 --> 02:16:48.130]
Hey, I was over there at the shell station.

[02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:48.350]
Yeah.

[02:16:48.790 --> 02:16:50.330]
I got a couple of tickets.

[02:16:50.330 --> 02:16:51.250]
One and say thanks.

[02:16:51.830 --> 02:16:56.070]
I got a beautiful bumper sticker here with no imagination put into it at all.

[02:16:56.890 --> 02:17:01.110]
And on university and about 5th street in front of the mall there is about

[02:17:01.730 --> 02:17:04.050]
5 plantation cops with the radar gun going.

[02:17:06.430 --> 02:17:07.770]
Let's just call to say thanks.

[02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:12.770]
Probably a combination Passover and the good Friday greeting for it from our plantation

[02:17:12.770 --> 02:17:13.370]
porkers.

[02:17:13.770 --> 02:17:16.010]
They're keeping all the Cubans away from that shell station.

[02:17:16.590 --> 02:17:17.630]
Like I said, good thinking.

[02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:18.670]
Okay, have a great day, pal.

[02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.230]
Yeah.

[02:17:19.470 --> 02:17:19.730]
Okay.

[02:17:21.490 --> 02:17:24.070]
We don't want, you know, we have a few who will be listening to the plantation.

[02:17:24.330 --> 02:17:25.490]
Most of them are out there at the sawgrass.

[02:17:25.490 --> 02:17:26.850]
And they're not really they're not Cuban.

[02:17:27.470 --> 02:17:28.510]
They're from Brazil.

[02:17:28.750 --> 02:17:29.390]
They're from Argentina.

[02:17:29.410 --> 02:17:30.390]
They're from Patigua.

[02:17:30.510 --> 02:17:30.990]
They're from Peru.

[02:17:31.150 --> 02:17:32.370]
They're from hunger.

[02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:33.710]
They're from everywhere.

[02:17:34.390 --> 02:17:35.950]
Who are those people with the sawgrass?

[02:17:36.170 --> 02:17:36.770]
Does anybody know?

[02:17:37.070 --> 02:17:37.070]

[02:17:37.590 --> 02:17:40.230]
Does anybody in the world know who those people are?

[02:17:41.430 --> 02:17:45.550]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:17:45.550 --> 02:17:46.250]
I got a fact here.

[02:17:46.330 --> 02:17:48.730]
It says that wasn't really a hack that was somebody doing hangs voice.

[02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:50.510]
They've been working on this all morning long.

[02:17:50.750 --> 02:17:52.130]
And they're trying to make him look bad.

[02:17:52.130 --> 02:17:53.930]
And they're trying to make fat head look good.

[02:17:53.930 --> 02:17:54.510]
And etc.

[02:17:54.910 --> 02:17:56.370]
And default being the whip that he is,

[02:17:56.490 --> 02:18:00.110]
he just sat back and let Joe Rose overrun the whole deal this morning.

[02:18:00.150 --> 02:18:03.330]
Well, I talked to the SPN, the magazine, John Quayton.

[02:18:03.930 --> 02:18:05.090]
And he confirmed it.

[02:18:05.170 --> 02:18:06.430]
That don't sound like Hank to me.

[02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:08.770]
But I'm back here in the butt, honey.

[02:18:09.010 --> 02:18:10.090]
All right, honey, baby.

[02:18:10.230 --> 02:18:13.850]
Get ready because you're about to be taken to heaven by your favorite lover.

[02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:15.030]
Oh, no, I'm not.

[02:18:15.250 --> 02:18:15.650]
What do you mean?

[02:18:15.990 --> 02:18:16.410]
Why not?

[02:18:16.710 --> 02:18:17.870]
You've got dandruff.

[02:18:18.150 --> 02:18:18.770]
I do not.

[02:18:19.050 --> 02:18:19.790]
Look, please.

[02:18:20.090 --> 02:18:20.670]
Not there.

[02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:21.130]
Where?

[02:18:21.350 --> 02:18:21.950]
Your ass.

[02:18:22.310 --> 02:18:22.450]
Not.

[02:18:22.450 --> 02:18:23.690]
Ass dandruff again.

[02:18:24.050 --> 02:18:24.870]
Damn, Harryass.

[02:18:25.150 --> 02:18:27.450]
That's what you get for using regular ass shampoo.

[02:18:27.870 --> 02:18:30.010]
A crackful of soot and another night alone.

[02:18:30.270 --> 02:18:30.790]
What do I do?

[02:18:30.990 --> 02:18:32.010]
Try ass and crack.

[02:18:32.250 --> 02:18:33.510]
From the makers of head and shoulders.

[02:18:33.870 --> 02:18:36.450]
Ass and crack is the miracle cure you've been looking for.

[02:18:36.730 --> 02:18:37.270]
Quick and easy.

[02:18:37.670 --> 02:18:39.290]
Wash, wipe your hand, then go.

[02:18:39.450 --> 02:18:41.770]
Wow, your ass dandruff is gone.

[02:18:42.790 --> 02:18:45.050]
And it smells great too.

[02:18:45.550 --> 02:18:46.450]
Thanks, ass and crack.

[02:18:46.590 --> 02:18:48.310]
Ass and crack can be found in the embarrassing island

[02:18:48.310 --> 02:18:49.150]
of your local supermarket.

[02:18:49.670 --> 02:18:49.910]
Thank you.

[02:18:50.050 --> 02:18:51.850]
115 at 560 WQIM.

[02:18:53.250 --> 02:18:53.650]
WQIM.

[02:18:53.770 --> 02:18:53.910]
Hello.

[02:18:56.470 --> 02:18:56.870]
QAM.

[02:18:57.810 --> 02:18:58.610]
Yes, sir.

[02:18:59.050 --> 02:19:02.230]
Yes, I'll start to get information about somebody

[02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:04.030]
told me about the trade that the dolphins made through

[02:19:04.030 --> 02:19:04.430]
with the ref.

[02:19:04.530 --> 02:19:06.370]
Yeah, they traded Dan Marino for a 10th round

[02:19:06.370 --> 02:19:07.030]
graphic rent.

[02:19:07.710 --> 02:19:09.230]
Well, that's the April 4th.

[02:19:09.330 --> 02:19:09.810]
What is it?

[02:19:10.090 --> 02:19:11.010]
The April 4th joke.

[02:19:11.230 --> 02:19:13.570]
No, no, they traded Dan Marino for a 16th round graphic.

[02:19:13.870 --> 02:19:14.950]
That's what you just said 10th.

[02:19:15.310 --> 02:19:15.510]
What?

[02:19:15.910 --> 02:19:16.850]
25th round graphic.

[02:19:17.670 --> 02:19:18.750]
Here's a mobile in deer field.

[02:19:18.750 --> 02:19:19.070]
Hello.

[02:19:20.090 --> 02:19:20.610]
Hey, Neil.

[02:19:21.310 --> 02:19:21.830]
You're good.

[02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:22.650]
Yes, I am.

[02:19:23.610 --> 02:19:24.290]
Every day.

[02:19:24.290 --> 02:19:24.350]
Very good.

[02:19:24.550 --> 02:19:24.630]
I'm very glad to have you here.

[02:19:24.630 --> 02:19:25.030]
I've been going to get the latest

[02:19:26.690 --> 02:19:28.330]
congratulations on hanging out in this toilet

[02:19:28.330 --> 02:19:29.990]
for all the years you have on a hotline.

[02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:32.550]
23 years plus pound, 23 years, and I want

[02:19:33.310 --> 02:19:34.110]
it's ridiculous.

[02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:35.410]
I listen to you every day.

[02:19:35.570 --> 02:19:36.950]
I miss what happened this morning.

[02:19:37.650 --> 02:19:38.310]
You know, whatever.

[02:19:38.790 --> 02:19:40.870]
But why are you going to give me a capsule version, okay?

[02:19:40.990 --> 02:19:43.590]
If you'll find Joe Rose thinking that he was going to be

[02:19:43.590 --> 02:19:45.170]
a real comic, which he's not.

[02:19:45.610 --> 02:19:46.710]
But as funny as a heart attack,

[02:19:46.990 --> 02:19:48.570]
he decided that was April 4th there.

[02:19:48.670 --> 02:19:51.810]
So they come on here and make up this bogus dolphin trade

[02:19:51.810 --> 02:19:53.250]
where they traded Richmond Web,

[02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:56.890]
Kareemat Dual Jabbar, both of them to the Redskins

[02:19:56.890 --> 02:19:59.030]
for the number five, their first hydrafic,

[02:19:59.110 --> 02:20:00.390]
which is number five in the first round.

[02:20:00.910 --> 02:20:02.230]
And they're going on a conjecturing.

[02:20:02.410 --> 02:20:03.450]
Will it be a running back?

[02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:05.810]
Maybe it's going to be Edger and James and Yadia.

[02:20:06.110 --> 02:20:07.930]
And then they got people doing fake voices

[02:20:07.930 --> 02:20:10.310]
pretending to call the Redskins office

[02:20:10.310 --> 02:20:12.490]
and doing a fake voice from a Redskins owner.

[02:20:12.750 --> 02:20:15.170]
And then even they had Hank or somebody impersonating Hank

[02:20:15.170 --> 02:20:16.670]
calling it on the ear saying, oh yeah,

[02:20:16.830 --> 02:20:18.350]
he talked to so into what ESPN

[02:20:18.350 --> 02:20:19.310]
who just confirmed it.

[02:20:19.370 --> 02:20:20.510]
Is it on deal and Yadia?

[02:20:20.970 --> 02:20:23.130]
You know, I don't even listen to those guys.

[02:20:23.390 --> 02:20:25.130]
And that just substantiates it more.

[02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:27.630]
You know, I listen to some other asshole

[02:20:27.630 --> 02:20:30.550]
on some other station that rips all your material off.

[02:20:31.050 --> 02:20:31.690]
Not all of them.

[02:20:31.870 --> 02:20:33.290]
I'm talking about.

[02:20:33.770 --> 02:20:35.850]
I just, it's so comical what he does.

[02:20:36.310 --> 02:20:38.330]
Really, one of the reasons I call it,

[02:20:38.410 --> 02:20:39.970]
I'm getting out of this toilet for a few days.

[02:20:39.970 --> 02:20:41.950]
I'm going to Pittsburgh, which is much better.

[02:20:42.090 --> 02:20:43.190]
But it's my hometown.

[02:20:44.670 --> 02:20:46.830]
And I've been listening to you for about four years.

[02:20:47.190 --> 02:20:48.930]
And I just wish all the listeners

[02:20:49.590 --> 02:20:52.910]
that are out there, which is listen to what you're saying.

[02:20:53.210 --> 02:20:55.370]
Right. Make decisions based on facts.

[02:20:55.490 --> 02:20:57.030]
Right. Not bunch of crap.

[02:20:57.290 --> 02:20:59.530]
Not, you know, the whole religion of things ridiculous.

[02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:01.550]
But you've enlightened me.

[02:21:02.070 --> 02:21:03.730]
And I was like, I can say, thanks for everything.

[02:21:03.890 --> 02:21:04.490]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

[02:21:04.570 --> 02:21:06.370]
Speaking of Pittsburgh, even Mike Lane says,

[02:21:06.530 --> 02:21:07.090]
I know my crap.

[02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:07.910]
That's right.

[02:21:08.130 --> 02:21:12.130]
Well, I got a fly coach and that, I got my values.

[02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.770]
Okay.

[02:21:13.010 --> 02:21:13.530]
Take care of Neil.

[02:21:13.550 --> 02:21:14.010]
Good luck, pal.

[02:21:14.210 --> 02:21:14.430]
Bye-bye.

[02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:15.550]
Don't take any wooden lunch.

[02:21:16.270 --> 02:21:17.810]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[02:21:17.970 --> 02:21:20.250]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:21:20.570 --> 02:21:21.950]
All this enthusiasm and excitement

[02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:24.230]
about the fact that the Panther Organization, once again,

[02:21:24.610 --> 02:21:26.150]
has lied through their teeth and now everybody's

[02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:26.930]
paying a price for it.

[02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:28.710]
And everybody's threatening this one and that one

[02:21:28.710 --> 02:21:29.750]
and the doctors all upset.

[02:21:30.050 --> 02:21:31.070]
And yaddy, yaddy, yaddy.

[02:21:31.710 --> 02:21:33.490]
See, when you don't, when you're not straight tutors,

[02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:35.370]
when you don't pay straight with the public sooner or later,

[02:21:35.590 --> 02:21:37.010]
you've got a boxer, seven to a corner.

[02:21:37.170 --> 02:21:39.550]
And no matter what you say, it's boy who cried Wolfsendrow.

[02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:40.810]
Kind of like a Greg Reed thing.

[02:21:41.170 --> 02:21:43.430]
No matter what you say, nobody's going to believe it anymore.

[02:21:44.110 --> 02:21:46.950]
No matter what you say, just like, oh, we paid that bill.

[02:21:47.230 --> 02:21:48.170]
Oh, yeah, right.

[02:21:48.250 --> 02:21:49.490]
We believe you paid a bill.

[02:21:50.510 --> 02:21:52.370]
And that's what the organization has done.

[02:21:52.630 --> 02:21:53.270]
And let me say what?

[02:21:54.190 --> 02:21:54.470]
What?

[02:21:54.950 --> 02:21:57.130]
The crank, the prank that you just played on that collar.

[02:21:57.550 --> 02:21:59.130]
Now they're calling because they're

[02:21:59.130 --> 02:22:01.690]
taking that seriously over and over and over again.

[02:22:01.930 --> 02:22:02.850]
What do you mean they're taking them seriously?

[02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:05.110]
It just came to me on the facts here.

[02:22:07.550 --> 02:22:08.150]
Here it is.

[02:22:09.170 --> 02:22:12.530]
Well, I talked with the SPN, the magazines, John Quayton.

[02:22:12.530 --> 02:22:14.250]
And he confirmed it.

[02:22:14.250 --> 02:22:15.870]
Yeah, Dan Marie-Know goes from the dolphin

[02:22:15.870 --> 02:22:17.990]
to the redskins for the other number one draft pick,

[02:22:18.010 --> 02:22:19.830]
which is the fifth pick in the first round.

[02:22:22.690 --> 02:22:23.010]
What?

[02:22:23.730 --> 02:22:25.570]
I was just about to say something important.

[02:22:25.710 --> 02:22:27.330]
And you're that's a given.

[02:22:27.390 --> 02:22:28.170]
Everybody knows that.

[02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.970]
We know he was getting old.

[02:22:31.050 --> 02:22:31.790]
He's got bad wheels.

[02:22:31.790 --> 02:22:33.090]
It's going to be like a Palm Elbrough.

[02:22:33.210 --> 02:22:34.630]
I think you're trading guy with bad knees away.

[02:22:34.750 --> 02:22:36.430]
And then they're going to think they're getting a jackpot.

[02:22:36.430 --> 02:22:37.350]
And they're going to get a crackpot.

[02:22:37.470 --> 02:22:38.270]
You know, we love you, Danny.

[02:22:38.410 --> 02:22:39.310]
But time's up.

[02:22:39.690 --> 02:22:40.370]
Time's up, sweetheart.

[02:22:41.310 --> 02:22:43.770]
I said, all those old creaking easy years you've had it.

[02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:47.130]
I was just about to say something very important there.

[02:22:47.130 --> 02:22:49.470]
And you give me side crack with some Jack Gases calling in.

[02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:51.190]
Don't believe that Dan Marino got traded.

[02:22:52.410 --> 02:22:55.310]
You know, I think if we really want to get this town going

[02:22:55.310 --> 02:22:57.910]
because it's such a dead ass place anyway, let's do that.

[02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:59.770]
Nobody cares about credibility in this town.

[02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:02.810]
I came on here, I told you weeks ago

[02:23:02.810 --> 02:23:04.670]
that after Burrey got injured in a Colorado game,

[02:23:04.990 --> 02:23:06.850]
everybody in North America except in this town

[02:23:06.850 --> 02:23:08.270]
was reporting he's out for the year.

[02:23:08.490 --> 02:23:09.090]
I told you that.

[02:23:09.090 --> 02:23:10.990]
Nobody told me that I read about it.

[02:23:11.090 --> 02:23:11.810]
I got on the internet.

[02:23:12.010 --> 02:23:13.770]
I talked to people from outside this town

[02:23:13.770 --> 02:23:16.730]
who like no hockey, another part to the country in Canada.

[02:23:17.210 --> 02:23:18.950]
I read it up there in the Toronto sun.

[02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:19.870]
I wanted my many trips.

[02:23:20.570 --> 02:23:21.970]
Everybody except here knew it.

[02:23:22.090 --> 02:23:23.150]
But nobody cares for that.

[02:23:23.930 --> 02:23:25.170]
They enjoy bullcrap.

[02:23:25.310 --> 02:23:27.570]
So let's just, then we make a whole format out of that.

[02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:31.210]
Because in many ways, we've already accomplished it,

[02:23:31.250 --> 02:23:32.570]
especially with our management here.

[02:23:33.050 --> 02:23:34.930]
We'll just call it bullcrap radio.

[02:23:36.330 --> 02:23:38.750]
24 hours a day will feed your pile of bullcrap.

[02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:41.190]
Yeah, we'll make up stories, we'll make up trades.

[02:23:42.310 --> 02:23:44.370]
Oh my God, Jimmy Johnson just resigned

[02:23:44.370 --> 02:23:45.610]
to bringing Shola back.

[02:23:45.810 --> 02:23:46.790]
Oh, yeah.

[02:23:48.190 --> 02:23:50.990]
Jim Man, it's just had a baby, not his wife, the mad dog.

[02:23:50.990 --> 02:23:51.430]
Oh, right.

[02:23:51.570 --> 02:23:52.070]
He had a baby.

[02:23:53.290 --> 02:23:55.250]
Anything else we can tell you that some jackass

[02:23:55.250 --> 02:23:56.330]
out there might believe, huh?

[02:23:57.230 --> 02:23:58.750]
Oh, but I heard it on the radio.

[02:23:59.270 --> 02:24:02.630]
Oh, see, that's the problem with our sports bags.

[02:24:02.990 --> 02:24:04.390]
Is there so not even so stupid

[02:24:04.390 --> 02:24:06.790]
that if they do hear it on the radio, they will believe it.

[02:24:08.750 --> 02:24:10.210]
They could come on a morning show tomorrow

[02:24:10.210 --> 02:24:12.010]
and say, oh, it was just an April Fool.

[02:24:12.110 --> 02:24:12.770]
Oh, but guess what?

[02:24:12.830 --> 02:24:13.630]
Here's another report.

[02:24:13.990 --> 02:24:15.670]
They just traded Richmond Web to the Red Skin

[02:24:15.670 --> 02:24:18.650]
for two or two other Rams rather for somebody else.

[02:24:18.910 --> 02:24:20.350]
Or they just signed up Lawrence Phillips

[02:24:20.350 --> 02:24:22.710]
and what's his name?

[02:24:22.930 --> 02:24:23.710]
Sammy Smith again.

[02:24:24.250 --> 02:24:24.910]
Bobby Humphrey.

[02:24:26.410 --> 02:24:27.450]
And Tony Martin.

[02:24:27.790 --> 02:24:28.970]
We're gonna have the All Gangs to team.

[02:24:30.970 --> 02:24:32.950]
Here's and Mark Dupur.

[02:24:33.710 --> 02:24:36.530]
Oh, Neil, the worst part about this.

[02:24:36.690 --> 02:24:37.670]
The worst part about this?

[02:24:38.330 --> 02:24:38.690]
Exactly.

[02:24:39.010 --> 02:24:42.390]
That's him is that they're ripping off a caller from last year.

[02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:44.750]
Yeah, you remember that on April 1st last year?

[02:24:44.870 --> 02:24:45.030]
No.

[02:24:45.610 --> 02:24:46.950]
When the caller called in.

[02:24:47.050 --> 02:24:48.050]
Probably one of those many days

[02:24:48.050 --> 02:24:49.350]
that wasn't with the first show.

[02:24:49.830 --> 02:24:51.990]
Well, a caller called in last year and totally Dupur.

[02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:53.330]
I don't remember which Josh it was,

[02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:56.170]
but then he got one of the guys on air to report.

[02:24:56.330 --> 02:24:58.190]
There was the whole story about the Lawrence big soul.

[02:24:58.330 --> 02:24:59.330]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:24:59.330 --> 02:25:01.950]
And this guy was a, he happens to be a friend of mine

[02:25:01.950 --> 02:25:03.090]
that was able to pull this off.

[02:25:03.270 --> 02:25:03.450]
Right.

[02:25:03.530 --> 02:25:05.670]
Was able to get your backline number from your switch board

[02:25:05.670 --> 02:25:06.550]
and he called up me.

[02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:07.290]
What did that guy say?

[02:25:07.430 --> 02:25:08.370]
I think he said F something.

[02:25:08.910 --> 02:25:10.130]
But that was probably a guy called

[02:25:10.130 --> 02:25:11.490]
impersonated Hank this morning.

[02:25:11.490 --> 02:25:13.210]
He's a friend that does the voices.

[02:25:14.810 --> 02:25:16.890]
I've known Hank for like 20 years some years.

[02:25:17.050 --> 02:25:19.230]
Okay, believe me, that was not Hank Goldberg's voice.

[02:25:20.690 --> 02:25:22.290]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[02:25:22.410 --> 02:25:24.790]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:25:25.390 --> 02:25:26.730]
Here's a mobile in Miami Beach.

[02:25:26.850 --> 02:25:26.970]
Hello.

[02:25:27.370 --> 02:25:28.030]
Hey, Neil.

[02:25:28.290 --> 02:25:30.410]
The only time I listen to the witness team

[02:25:30.410 --> 02:25:31.590]
is during commercial break.

[02:25:31.950 --> 02:25:32.110]
Yeah.

[02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:34.290]
Well, I think he should be listening a lot then.

[02:25:34.750 --> 02:25:34.970]
Yeah.

[02:25:35.730 --> 02:25:36.530]
You know what?

[02:25:36.810 --> 02:25:38.910]
I caught him twice the first time.

[02:25:39.070 --> 02:25:42.510]
I tuned it in some Jackets as Joe Rose

[02:25:42.510 --> 02:25:43.670]
to play the Marlin song.

[02:25:43.670 --> 02:25:45.590]
So I was on it for about a second.

[02:25:46.290 --> 02:25:48.730]
And then the second time I tuned in,

[02:25:49.130 --> 02:25:51.370]
I hear Joe Rose going on about this trade.

[02:25:51.810 --> 02:25:54.030]
And I mean, right away you can tell him the goofball's tone

[02:25:54.030 --> 02:25:55.550]
that it's all, you know, the S.

[02:25:56.310 --> 02:25:57.730]
But I didn't hear Hank call.

[02:25:57.930 --> 02:26:00.410]
And but it's Hank did being that it's Eastern all

[02:26:01.150 --> 02:26:03.390]
before the Cockcrows three times,

[02:26:03.390 --> 02:26:05.990]
and Hank got a call up and deny it and then go hang himself.

[02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:07.550]
Yeah.

[02:26:08.210 --> 02:26:10.870]
Because I mean, if Hank played along with that thing,

[02:26:11.010 --> 02:26:12.490]
I mean, you're saying if Hank called in,

[02:26:12.570 --> 02:26:13.490]
then he should go hang himself?

[02:26:14.070 --> 02:26:14.430]
Absolutely.

[02:26:14.690 --> 02:26:16.730]
Well, when he comes in, he'll be in very shortly.

[02:26:16.830 --> 02:26:17.970]
We'll find out if he's hung or not.

[02:26:18.590 --> 02:26:19.550]
Which I don't really care.

[02:26:19.810 --> 02:26:22.790]
But now old Jewish guy like Hank can be that are this fat.

[02:26:22.930 --> 02:26:23.410]
Nobody's hung.

[02:26:23.650 --> 02:26:24.950]
You, if you were, you couldn't tell anyway.

[02:26:25.690 --> 02:26:27.670]
As in that, remember that movie like Kaja Fools?

[02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:32.790]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:34.850]
They're all taking this very serious, okay?

[02:26:35.330 --> 02:26:36.750]
They're taking this very serious.

[02:26:37.970 --> 02:26:39.810]
Remember when Centina was talking to Michael there

[02:26:39.810 --> 02:26:40.790]
and the Godfather one?

[02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:43.250]
You're taking it personal.

[02:26:43.430 --> 02:26:45.370]
This is business and you're just taking it personal.

[02:26:45.770 --> 02:26:46.590]
No, it is business.

[02:26:47.330 --> 02:26:47.950]
It can't wait.

[02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:56.710]
There must be 64,285 lines from just from Godfather one along.

[02:26:57.050 --> 02:26:58.770]
And by the way, you know, I know there's a lot of little kids

[02:26:58.770 --> 02:27:01.790]
up there in the crowd at the Macarena.

[02:27:01.790 --> 02:27:04.010]
But if you're going to keep showing that Howard Beal thing,

[02:27:04.170 --> 02:27:05.570]
there would say do all over the NHL now

[02:27:05.570 --> 02:27:06.470]
by a lot of the arenas.

[02:27:06.690 --> 02:27:07.690]
You're going to show the first part.

[02:27:07.850 --> 02:27:08.510]
Show the rest of it.

[02:27:12.290 --> 02:27:13.970]
We want to see the whole thing, okay?

[02:27:14.750 --> 02:27:16.050]
Not just Howard in the raincoat.

[02:27:17.170 --> 02:27:21.010]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:27:21.950 --> 02:27:22.670]
Here's North Miami.

[02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:23.010]
Hello.

[02:27:24.470 --> 02:27:25.110]
North Miami.

[02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.970]
Yeah, well, no.

[02:27:26.970 --> 02:27:31.290]
The worst Oscar for a worst acting job

[02:27:31.290 --> 02:27:33.650]
during April Fools has got to go to the first team.

[02:27:33.950 --> 02:27:33.950]

[02:27:34.750 --> 02:27:35.190]
Joe.

[02:27:36.390 --> 02:27:37.390]
You mean you could hear?

[02:27:37.570 --> 02:27:38.830]
I mean, it's the worst.

[02:27:38.970 --> 02:27:40.330]
How was it?

[02:27:40.430 --> 02:27:43.730]
You know, he's in the bag in a pub.

[02:27:44.470 --> 02:27:45.370]
Of course, DFO.

[02:27:45.770 --> 02:27:46.870]
DFO is like, whoa.

[02:27:47.290 --> 02:27:50.250]
He could suck up to him and be real nice to him and kiss his butt.

[02:27:50.670 --> 02:27:50.670]

[02:27:51.210 --> 02:27:51.450]
Yeah.

[02:27:51.890 --> 02:27:54.770]
And that guy lost the $300 in obvious plants

[02:27:54.770 --> 02:27:56.270]
just to try to make him look good.

[02:27:56.270 --> 02:27:57.050]
He's like a clever.

[02:27:58.110 --> 02:27:58.190]
Yeah.

[02:27:58.490 --> 02:28:02.210]
And I've never seen two guys, two dorks,

[02:28:02.470 --> 02:28:04.930]
graduating themselves, how clever they are since I saw

[02:28:04.930 --> 02:28:05.990]
the movie, Dumb and Dumber.

[02:28:06.190 --> 02:28:06.830]
That's all I got to say.

[02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:07.810]
Well, in fact, they were in it.

[02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:09.150]
You didn't know it, but they didn't get to credits.

[02:28:09.370 --> 02:28:09.750]
They were in it.

[02:28:10.130 --> 02:28:10.630]
Okay, thanks.

[02:28:11.270 --> 02:28:13.070]
In other words, what he's trying to say is one good fat head

[02:28:13.070 --> 02:28:13.990]
deserves another, Joe.

[02:28:14.610 --> 02:28:14.910]
Yomama.

[02:28:15.370 --> 02:28:17.090]
That's what the audience basically is saying

[02:28:17.090 --> 02:28:17.710]
to the morning team.

[02:28:18.010 --> 02:28:18.570]
Yomama, okay?

[02:28:18.670 --> 02:28:19.170]
Don't do it again.

[02:28:19.470 --> 02:28:20.550]
They may forgive you this time.

[02:28:20.810 --> 02:28:22.370]
Maybe they'll come back again tomorrow for some more.

[02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:23.750]
I know I'm taking the day off tomorrow.

[02:28:23.770 --> 02:28:24.730]
I'm so embarrassed about it.

[02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:27.430]
I'm going to have to think about it long and hard

[02:28:27.430 --> 02:28:29.650]
over the weekend if I want to follow that show or not.

[02:28:30.010 --> 02:28:31.030]
And then I'll kind of look at my pace.

[02:28:31.110 --> 02:28:33.830]
When I say, yeah, I guess I'll swallow my pride.

[02:28:35.330 --> 02:28:36.050]
Here's a middly.

[02:28:36.150 --> 02:28:36.330]
Hello.

[02:28:37.830 --> 02:28:38.190]
Neil.

[02:28:38.430 --> 02:28:38.730]
Yes, sir.

[02:28:39.010 --> 02:28:39.370]
How are you doing?

[02:28:39.570 --> 02:28:39.770]
Great.

[02:28:40.110 --> 02:28:41.590]
Let me tell you the first team's health sucks.

[02:28:41.890 --> 02:28:42.030]
Yeah.

[02:28:42.490 --> 02:28:43.250]
I can't stand them.

[02:28:43.350 --> 02:28:46.690]
Joe Rose would have idiotic lines and jumped

[02:28:46.690 --> 02:28:49.430]
the floor, so his corn lines can't take them.

[02:28:49.910 --> 02:28:51.150]
I dumped the bitch right now.

[02:28:51.450 --> 02:28:51.930]
No, not me.

[02:28:52.210 --> 02:28:53.510]
I want to hear what everything he's got to say.

[02:28:53.510 --> 02:28:54.830]
Let me tell you the reason I call it.

[02:28:54.870 --> 02:28:54.990]
Yeah.

[02:28:55.310 --> 02:28:56.870]
I'm moving to Idaho to Harp.

[02:28:57.330 --> 02:28:57.550]
Boring.

[02:28:57.830 --> 02:29:00.170]
Boring every time you say it's boring and have a nice life.

[02:29:01.310 --> 02:29:02.810]
And your boyfriend's too, your mama.

[02:29:04.290 --> 02:29:07.830]
560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:29:09.170 --> 02:29:10.090]
Oh, I'm more now.

[02:29:10.250 --> 02:29:11.390]
And I had nothing to do with that.

[02:29:11.630 --> 02:29:13.110]
Like Larry would say, I had nothing to do with this.

[02:29:13.230 --> 02:29:15.530]
I came in here today full of stuff about the adocta

[02:29:15.530 --> 02:29:17.670]
and the Cleveland Clinic and Pavel Burry

[02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:18.950]
and at horrible game last night.

[02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:20.650]
And the red light that still doesn't go on

[02:29:20.650 --> 02:29:21.510]
that nobody cares about.

[02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:23.950]
And the Jews not showing up last night from Paceoff

[02:29:23.950 --> 02:29:25.950]
and all those goyums standing up in front of us

[02:29:25.950 --> 02:29:26.430]
during the game.

[02:29:28.350 --> 02:29:30.810]
I mean, if you really wanted to see what this town

[02:29:30.810 --> 02:29:33.150]
is all about, you really had to be there early

[02:29:33.870 --> 02:29:36.350]
at the Macaroon last night and look around and wonder,

[02:29:36.770 --> 02:29:37.130]
huh?

[02:29:37.790 --> 02:29:38.790]
Like where is it?

[02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:41.350]
I thought maybe the game was going to be played up there

[02:29:41.350 --> 02:29:42.210]
on the island or something.

[02:29:42.350 --> 02:29:44.070]
I thought, is this a road game or something?

[02:29:44.270 --> 02:29:44.950]
I make a mistake.

[02:29:46.670 --> 02:29:47.950]
What's going on over here?

[02:29:49.130 --> 02:29:51.510]
And then all these strangers started showing up.

[02:29:51.570 --> 02:29:52.990]
People we've never seen before.

[02:29:56.330 --> 02:29:57.950]
Hey, you want to get yourself a great cigar?

[02:29:58.170 --> 02:30:00.490]
Well, do it today because I got news for tomorrow

[02:30:00.490 --> 02:30:03.370]
for Easter for good Friday and for Paceoff.

[02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:05.050]
Next is going to be closed.

[02:30:05.850 --> 02:30:07.610]
So over the weekend, certainly for the holidays,

[02:30:07.770 --> 02:30:09.970]
is it okay to smoke Stogie on Paceoff?

[02:30:10.170 --> 02:30:10.970]
Sure, why not?

[02:30:11.430 --> 02:30:12.550]
As long as there's no bread in it.

[02:30:13.070 --> 02:30:15.750]
As long as it's unleavened tobacco.

[02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:18.590]
And believe me, I guarantee you, all the tobacco they use

[02:30:18.590 --> 02:30:21.190]
to make those great premium quality cigars and nicks

[02:30:21.190 --> 02:30:22.230]
on leaven, baby.

[02:30:22.450 --> 02:30:23.450]
Make no mistake about it.

[02:30:23.490 --> 02:30:23.750]
Ow!

[02:30:24.290 --> 02:30:26.890]
I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[02:30:31.370 --> 02:30:34.930]
Oh, hey.

[02:30:36.150 --> 02:30:38.510]
Ask me how I knew.

[02:30:39.870 --> 02:30:42.970]
That milk was a tube.

[02:30:43.810 --> 02:30:50.370]
Oh, hey, I just finally say.

[02:30:51.410 --> 02:30:53.670]
Yes, you may be gay.

[02:30:54.450 --> 02:30:57.850]
But it's different in one way.

[02:31:04.230 --> 02:31:11.950]
Look, I'm his cat, you find a spot of a city

[02:31:11.950 --> 02:31:13.930]
called Hawaii.

[02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:24.350]
Oh, hey, when you sit on his throne and looks at empty phones,

[02:31:25.090 --> 02:31:29.050]
there's a Yamakite on his door.

[02:31:30.530 --> 02:31:31.090]
What?

[02:31:33.050 --> 02:31:36.050]
Oh, hey, hey.

[02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:47.730]
Are you doing artwork on those beautiful new bumper

[02:31:47.730 --> 02:31:48.470]
stickers or arsir?

[02:31:48.470 --> 02:31:49.370]
What are you doing in there?

[02:31:50.170 --> 02:31:52.750]
George has done a little paste and clip and snip

[02:31:52.750 --> 02:31:54.370]
and whatever and tape.

[02:31:55.250 --> 02:31:57.030]
Oh, look, isn't that the...

[02:31:57.030 --> 02:32:00.210]
Oh, I love it.

[02:32:01.770 --> 02:32:02.470]
That's the best.

[02:32:02.770 --> 02:32:04.930]
Instead of where it says sports radio on the bumper sticker,

[02:32:05.110 --> 02:32:08.490]
he's changing it and says, Fag Radio, 560 WQA

[02:32:08.490 --> 02:32:11.090]
and inside the 6th, the O, and the Q and E A,

[02:32:11.470 --> 02:32:13.870]
is a little picture of me with a cigarette stoke in my purse.

[02:32:14.830 --> 02:32:16.970]
All Fag Radio, 560 QAM.

[02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:19.390]
There he is, right there in the inside of the thing.

[02:32:21.550 --> 02:32:23.410]
Sam, I'm going to tell you with your imagination,

[02:32:24.210 --> 02:32:26.050]
with your tremendous ability to come up

[02:32:26.050 --> 02:32:27.530]
with all these phenomenal concepts.

[02:32:27.950 --> 02:32:29.250]
It's a wonder that we're still on the air.

[02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:32.430]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[02:32:33.090 --> 02:32:34.250]
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir.

[02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:37.190]
Yeah, I was wondering if you saw the Sun Sentinel,

[02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:41.070]
the article that Jeff Bush signed about the...

[02:32:41.070 --> 02:32:42.650]
Okay, well, what it said was,

[02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:45.150]
any crime that's being committed with a gun,

[02:32:45.570 --> 02:32:48.310]
a felony crime is going to get a minimum of 10 years

[02:32:48.310 --> 02:32:52.450]
and if the gun is shot, it's going to be a minimum of 20 years.

[02:32:52.450 --> 02:32:56.570]
Yeah. Well, there's an 11-member black caucus

[02:32:56.570 --> 02:32:59.070]
that decided that this would be unfair

[02:32:59.070 --> 02:33:00.850]
to the African-American community.

[02:33:00.910 --> 02:33:01.570]
And why is that?

[02:33:02.650 --> 02:33:03.750]
That's what I want to know.

[02:33:04.890 --> 02:33:05.710]
Why is this...

[02:33:05.710 --> 02:33:09.610]
How about if we make it that when the white people

[02:33:10.130 --> 02:33:12.790]
commit those crimes to get how it's 12 or 20, whatever you said?

[02:33:13.090 --> 02:33:14.650]
And when darker people commit to crime,

[02:33:14.810 --> 02:33:16.170]
depending on the shade, in other words,

[02:33:16.330 --> 02:33:18.030]
the darker you are, the less time you'll do.

[02:33:18.310 --> 02:33:19.130]
Right, right.

[02:33:19.230 --> 02:33:20.650]
Another word we'll do it by shade.

[02:33:21.310 --> 02:33:23.550]
In fact, even if you're a white guy with a good 10,

[02:33:23.710 --> 02:33:25.110]
then you also get a few years knocked off.

[02:33:25.170 --> 02:33:26.490]
You will. You'll get at least seven then.

[02:33:26.690 --> 02:33:27.530]
Okay, that's not bad.

[02:33:28.730 --> 02:33:30.030]
Yeah. That's all I have, you know.

[02:33:30.130 --> 02:33:31.190]
Figures. Okay, thank you.

[02:33:31.510 --> 02:33:32.170]
There you go again.

[02:33:32.370 --> 02:33:34.290]
Say, discriminate again against the...

[02:33:34.290 --> 02:33:35.810]
Yeah, you know something, if you're a gangster,

[02:33:36.070 --> 02:33:37.570]
if you're a criminal, we don't like you.

[02:33:37.650 --> 02:33:38.630]
Okay, we don't care if you're white,

[02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:40.290]
you're black, you're a stick, you're a Jew,

[02:33:40.470 --> 02:33:40.970]
you're a fag.

[02:33:41.130 --> 02:33:42.050]
We don't care what you are.

[02:33:42.250 --> 02:33:44.030]
If you're a piece of slime, we don't like you.

[02:33:44.110 --> 02:33:44.290]
Period.

[02:33:44.930 --> 02:33:46.130]
And we're going to throw the book at you.

[02:33:47.750 --> 02:33:49.350]
Everything is a big racial thing,

[02:33:49.430 --> 02:33:50.390]
like I said the other day.

[02:33:50.390 --> 02:33:52.370]
The most sensible thing I ever said in my life,

[02:33:52.690 --> 02:33:54.410]
get rid of these labels for Christ's sake.

[02:33:54.870 --> 02:33:57.310]
Well, all of a sudden, wow, my ear just stuplogged up.

[02:33:57.790 --> 02:33:57.950]
Woo!

[02:33:59.930 --> 02:34:00.990]
What's the been from that, Mata?

[02:34:02.570 --> 02:34:02.710]
Huh?

[02:34:03.210 --> 02:34:04.210]
No, I'm serious. It's good.

[02:34:04.310 --> 02:34:06.410]
It's good. It's still, maybe on 11th,

[02:34:06.410 --> 02:34:07.210]
but it's still carbohydrates.

[02:34:07.790 --> 02:34:09.090]
I bet you when I go home, my blood sugar,

[02:34:09.130 --> 02:34:10.350]
which was 73 this morning.

[02:34:10.370 --> 02:34:12.110]
I bet you, I can't eat that stuff.

[02:34:13.470 --> 02:34:14.310]
I can't eat it.

[02:34:14.390 --> 02:34:15.390]
Why did you let me do that?

[02:34:16.470 --> 02:34:17.210]
Was your idea?

[02:34:18.730 --> 02:34:19.210]
Wasn't it?

[02:34:19.210 --> 02:34:21.190]
So why did you let me eat that?

[02:34:21.290 --> 02:34:22.850]
You're supposed to be at least during these hours.

[02:34:23.190 --> 02:34:24.210]
Watch it now for my health.

[02:34:24.290 --> 02:34:25.350]
You know, I've been sick as a dog.

[02:34:25.970 --> 02:34:28.270]
I've been sitting here sitting on my organ,

[02:34:29.690 --> 02:34:30.510]
squeezing my organ.

[02:34:31.650 --> 02:34:33.390]
And this awful goddamn chair.

[02:34:33.670 --> 02:34:34.830]
I mean, the chair was great downstairs.

[02:34:35.290 --> 02:34:36.310]
There's nothing wrong with the chair.

[02:34:36.390 --> 02:34:37.010]
It's this counter.

[02:34:39.150 --> 02:34:41.110]
Let's have a little mutiny on the counter for Christ.

[02:34:41.250 --> 02:34:43.130]
The counter is too fricking high, man.

[02:34:43.230 --> 02:34:44.010]
It's too high.

[02:34:45.850 --> 02:34:47.450]
Like a little tiny five-year-old.

[02:34:47.450 --> 02:34:48.570]
It's like young kneel in the,

[02:34:48.590 --> 02:34:50.790]
and the height chair is sitting up here on a chair

[02:34:50.790 --> 02:34:53.290]
to the ceiling to try to avoid my breath bone

[02:34:53.290 --> 02:34:55.130]
and my puppet jamming out of this counter.

[02:34:55.150 --> 02:34:56.410]
That's too goddamn high.

[02:34:57.030 --> 02:34:58.610]
The counter is supposed to be a little bit lower

[02:34:58.610 --> 02:34:59.710]
just above your ****.

[02:34:59.830 --> 02:35:00.170]
That's right.

[02:35:01.030 --> 02:35:02.130]
You have plenty of room there.

[02:35:03.290 --> 02:35:04.370]
Here's the mobile in Pompano.

[02:35:04.510 --> 02:35:04.650]
Hello.

[02:35:05.070 --> 02:35:05.670]
Yeah, how are you doing?

[02:35:05.750 --> 02:35:06.010]
Great.

[02:35:07.650 --> 02:35:08.590]
Oh wait, there we go.

[02:35:08.670 --> 02:35:09.810]
Okay, there we go with that sound again.

[02:35:09.930 --> 02:35:10.210]
Can't talk.

[02:35:10.310 --> 02:35:11.250]
Sorry for sir, sorry.

[02:35:12.070 --> 02:35:13.310]
Another screwed up phone line.

[02:35:13.450 --> 02:35:13.990]
Mark it down.

[02:35:14.110 --> 02:35:16.610]
Okay, phone company is part and around with our phone lines again.

[02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:20.690]
I mean, you know, you can, you can suggest to yourself Mr. Reed

[02:35:20.690 --> 02:35:22.350]
that I'm making this up and I'm a bad guy

[02:35:22.350 --> 02:35:24.330]
because I haven't been hired here 17 times

[02:35:24.330 --> 02:35:25.530]
like your good buddy Gary Sarner.

[02:35:25.690 --> 02:35:27.910]
But the fact is, we got a bunch of garbage in here

[02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:28.570]
that some of it works.

[02:35:28.750 --> 02:35:29.870]
You know, it's a little bit better today.

[02:35:29.910 --> 02:35:30.430]
I'll give you that.

[02:35:31.570 --> 02:35:33.170]
We got a long way to go.

[02:35:33.290 --> 02:35:34.630]
The same man that looked me in the face

[02:35:34.630 --> 02:35:36.110]
of the hockey game a year and a half ago

[02:35:36.110 --> 02:35:38.030]
and said to me, oh yeah, we're going to build you

[02:35:38.030 --> 02:35:39.130]
state-of-the-art studios.

[02:35:39.450 --> 02:35:40.150]
We're going to do this.

[02:35:40.310 --> 02:35:40.890]
We're going to do that.

[02:35:41.050 --> 02:35:42.530]
We're going to go 50,000 watts.

[02:35:42.690 --> 02:35:43.890]
We're going to be like, oh yeah.

[02:35:45.190 --> 02:35:46.710]
We're going to even put some baseball down

[02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:49.050]
on the walls out there so it doesn't look like a schmootsy place

[02:35:49.050 --> 02:35:50.890]
where a bunch of stumble bumps are living

[02:35:51.690 --> 02:35:52.930]
like they would like to be these.

[02:35:54.370 --> 02:35:56.870]
I got news for if the beesleys haven't been over here recently

[02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:58.410]
to see the work of art that they produced,

[02:35:58.650 --> 02:35:59.830]
you'd be really proud, okay,

[02:35:59.910 --> 02:36:00.970]
because it's right up your alley.

[02:36:01.450 --> 02:36:02.030]
It's a toilet.

[02:36:03.610 --> 02:36:04.910]
Here's a mobile in North Miami.

[02:36:05.050 --> 02:36:05.170]
Hello.

[02:36:07.450 --> 02:36:08.450]
Mobile in North Miami.

[02:36:09.850 --> 02:36:12.430]
See, and that's a, see, it's not losing the cause you're wrong.

[02:36:13.290 --> 02:36:14.890]
Line four is screwed up

[02:36:14.890 --> 02:36:16.810]
and line one, we just heard there was all of that.

[02:36:16.890 --> 02:36:17.950]
The phones, there they go again.

[02:36:19.370 --> 02:36:20.470]
There they go again.

[02:36:20.610 --> 02:36:21.930]
Thank God it's almost two o'clock.

[02:36:23.710 --> 02:36:25.110]
And see, the reason that it's different

[02:36:25.110 --> 02:36:27.330]
from the other room is because this is a different studio.

[02:36:27.470 --> 02:36:29.270]
This phone thing is wired entirely independent

[02:36:29.270 --> 02:36:30.190]
and different from the other.

[02:36:30.390 --> 02:36:31.030]
And it screwed up.

[02:36:31.830 --> 02:36:33.970]
And maybe if we go through this another two, three hundred times,

[02:36:34.250 --> 02:36:35.870]
they'll have the phone company come in and do this

[02:36:35.870 --> 02:36:37.850]
and stay here until it's done right.

[02:36:38.050 --> 02:36:39.050]
I know that's asking a lot,

[02:36:39.270 --> 02:36:41.350]
but make them come in here and do it until it's done right

[02:36:41.350 --> 02:36:43.370]
and the phone really works like honest to God.

[02:36:44.890 --> 02:36:45.710]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:36:45.710 --> 02:36:46.050]
Hello.

[02:36:46.450 --> 02:36:47.070]
Hello Neil.

[02:36:47.130 --> 02:36:47.470]
Yes sir.

[02:36:47.970 --> 02:36:48.790]
I don't understand.

[02:36:49.070 --> 02:36:50.250]
I mean, I didn't hear it this morning,

[02:36:50.250 --> 02:36:54.010]
but Phil Henry was goofing on people like that for years.

[02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:55.190]
Yeah, but that's the Phil Henry.

[02:36:55.470 --> 02:36:55.490]
Phil Henry.

[02:36:55.490 --> 02:36:55.550]
Yeah, but that's the Phil Henry.

[02:36:55.610 --> 02:36:56.210]
Phil, huh?

[02:36:57.530 --> 02:36:58.750]
That was Phil Stick.

[02:36:58.950 --> 02:37:00.050]
Phil was supposed to, that was his act.

[02:37:00.210 --> 02:37:01.170]
Phil was a comedy show.

[02:37:01.450 --> 02:37:03.290]
These guys are supposed to be a sports show.

[02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:05.410]
Yeah, you know, I mean,

[02:37:05.690 --> 02:37:07.130]
you goofed on, you goofed on.

[02:37:07.990 --> 02:37:09.850]
I mean, either way, you're still goofed on.

[02:37:10.570 --> 02:37:11.970]
And now I thought Phil was hilarious.

[02:37:12.250 --> 02:37:13.410]
I thought his stuff really...

[02:37:13.410 --> 02:37:14.630]
Sure, let me say it again.

[02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:15.890]
I don't know what you didn't understand,

[02:37:16.030 --> 02:37:17.450]
but I just said, maybe I'm not communicating.

[02:37:17.810 --> 02:37:19.010]
That was Phil's show.

[02:37:19.210 --> 02:37:20.910]
Everybody with a brain knew that.

[02:37:21.030 --> 02:37:22.390]
That's what he was paid to do.

[02:37:22.850 --> 02:37:23.470]
These guys...

[02:37:23.470 --> 02:37:25.470]
People told this stuff all day.

[02:37:25.830 --> 02:37:27.570]
They know they do that and it's pathetic.

[02:37:28.770 --> 02:37:29.850]
I mean, it's a custom.

[02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.770]
Maybe we don't like it.

[02:37:30.970 --> 02:37:31.690]
Maybe we would maybe just...

[02:37:31.690 --> 02:37:32.990]
It's a custom.

[02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:34.270]
It's a custom?

[02:37:34.750 --> 02:37:35.010]
Yeah.

[02:37:35.450 --> 02:37:40.110]
So in other words, if you turn on Dan Rather than he said,

[02:37:40.410 --> 02:37:42.650]
the Russians have got nuclear warheads on the way,

[02:37:42.650 --> 02:37:44.730]
aimed at all of the major cities in America.

[02:37:45.050 --> 02:37:45.370]
Would you say,

[02:37:45.510 --> 02:37:46.350]
Ha-ha, that's Dan.

[02:37:46.470 --> 02:37:47.330]
It's April Fool's Day.

[02:37:47.610 --> 02:37:48.010]
Nice going.

[02:37:48.110 --> 02:37:48.650]
It's a custom.

[02:37:49.210 --> 02:37:50.130]
I don't watch Dan Rather.

[02:37:52.610 --> 02:37:53.430]
See, there you go.

[02:37:53.810 --> 02:37:54.470]
I risk my case.

[02:37:54.590 --> 02:37:55.550]
This guy don't watch Dan Rather.

[02:37:55.650 --> 02:37:56.230]
That's his problem.

[02:37:57.030 --> 02:37:58.370]
Anybody that don't watch Dan Rather

[02:37:58.370 --> 02:37:59.270]
as far as I'm concerned,

[02:37:59.870 --> 02:38:00.570]
to you, pal,

[02:38:00.910 --> 02:38:02.890]
probably watches that guy with a speech defect.

[02:38:05.850 --> 02:38:06.210]
5670560,

[02:38:06.390 --> 02:38:09.350]
Palm 560 on the AT&T wireless line 22-2.

[02:38:09.530 --> 02:38:11.890]
If you haven't handled me here in Studio 2-0-530,

[02:38:11.890 --> 02:38:14.150]
then he's going to become very, very Jewish put on his

[02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:15.290]
bean-yine-go-flyin' out of here.

[02:38:15.590 --> 02:38:17.410]
530-7, we got a good-go-ish, your boy.

[02:38:17.970 --> 02:38:19.890]
Jim Madditch is going to be here to carry you right up to

[02:38:19.890 --> 02:38:21.630]
Panther Time, 7 o'clock pregame.

[02:38:21.990 --> 02:38:23.510]
Panthers at the CAP 730 tonight,

[02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:23.910]
and of course,

[02:38:24.330 --> 02:38:25.870]
the bloom is pretty much off the road.

[02:38:26.050 --> 02:38:26.710]
It's off the Joe Rose.

[02:38:26.850 --> 02:38:28.610]
We're pretty burned out on that Panther crap.

[02:38:28.710 --> 02:38:29.810]
On those Panther dropping.

[02:38:30.170 --> 02:38:31.110]
Yesterday I was trying to,

[02:38:31.170 --> 02:38:31.810]
you know, keep my...

[02:38:31.810 --> 02:38:33.670]
Because we really did have a statistical chance,

[02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:36.350]
and we still do, but it's pretty weak,

[02:38:36.850 --> 02:38:37.730]
especially after that,

[02:38:37.890 --> 02:38:40.270]
really, really, really embarrassing effort

[02:38:40.270 --> 02:38:42.250]
if you can call it that last night.

[02:38:42.390 --> 02:38:43.370]
I'm a burst for you, boys.

[02:38:44.090 --> 02:38:45.010]
Gengalate, my baby.

[02:38:46.990 --> 02:38:47.930]
Think of that, Salina.

[02:38:48.110 --> 02:38:48.990]
Are you tired of your hand?

[02:38:49.110 --> 02:38:51.150]
Are your sheep so insane in the day you can't land?

[02:38:51.310 --> 02:38:52.210]
Is your cleanest bill high?

[02:38:52.370 --> 02:38:53.270]
Is your poor little bill higher?

[02:38:53.430 --> 02:38:55.490]
If the chick could be bought, would you definitely buy her?

[02:38:55.610 --> 02:38:56.550]
Well, now you can!

[02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:58.650]
That Dusty's low-read whorehouse.

[02:38:58.750 --> 02:38:59.890]
If you ever wanted a chick,

[02:39:00.050 --> 02:39:01.070]
but you're way too ugly,

[02:39:01.310 --> 02:39:02.470]
you've even tried to buy him,

[02:39:02.530 --> 02:39:03.650]
but you're way too poor.

[02:39:04.150 --> 02:39:05.190]
Now's your turn.

[02:39:05.450 --> 02:39:07.590]
My mommy gave me five dollars for groceries,

[02:39:07.870 --> 02:39:09.090]
but instead, I got to become

[02:39:09.090 --> 02:39:11.930]
petty-packing and just eat low-rein' hawk-house.

[02:39:12.210 --> 02:39:13.910]
So losers of America, unite!

[02:39:14.290 --> 02:39:16.750]
And your pet Dusty's today!

[02:39:17.150 --> 02:39:19.310]
Leave it to me to get to the bottom of the story again, man.

[02:39:19.450 --> 02:39:19.830]
I'll tell you.

[02:39:20.510 --> 02:39:21.430]
Hank just came in here.

[02:39:21.570 --> 02:39:22.810]
I got to, you know, I knew the story.

[02:39:23.670 --> 02:39:24.990]
There's no way that he would risk,

[02:39:25.150 --> 02:39:27.130]
uh, 800 years of credibility going on there

[02:39:27.130 --> 02:39:28.650]
with that bunch of that bogus morning show

[02:39:28.650 --> 02:39:29.310]
and do that crap.

[02:39:29.650 --> 02:39:30.650]
Pull the wall over your eyes.

[02:39:31.570 --> 02:39:32.370]
Phil Henry,

[02:39:33.490 --> 02:39:35.010]
doing a Hankover voice.

[02:39:35.270 --> 02:39:36.250]
Are you sure positive?

[02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:37.550]
That's the deal.

[02:39:38.610 --> 02:39:39.890]
Now, do you have any idea what?

[02:39:39.930 --> 02:39:41.650]
There must have been like 530 in the morning in LA

[02:39:41.650 --> 02:39:42.950]
and Phil agreed to be a good guy

[02:39:42.950 --> 02:39:44.110]
that he has agreed to,

[02:39:44.210 --> 02:39:45.370]
you know, work on it for a little while

[02:39:45.370 --> 02:39:46.070]
and the voice too.

[02:39:46.310 --> 02:39:47.150]
Did a perfect...

[02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:48.810]
Can you, you know, get off the table up there.

[02:39:48.890 --> 02:39:50.330]
Have you got that thing in the audio fault again?

[02:39:51.550 --> 02:39:52.690]
Now, if that isn't one of the greatest

[02:39:52.690 --> 02:39:53.950]
Hank Goldberg impersonations,

[02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:55.110]
are you sure positive?

[02:39:56.310 --> 02:39:56.710]
One more time.

[02:39:56.870 --> 02:39:58.530]
I talked with the SPN, the magazine,

[02:39:58.850 --> 02:39:59.650]
John Quayton,

[02:40:00.330 --> 02:40:01.410]
and he confirmed it.

[02:40:01.690 --> 02:40:02.010]
Okay.

[02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:03.110]
There you go, Phil Henry.

[02:40:03.550 --> 02:40:04.250]
Doing Hank's voice.

[02:40:04.470 --> 02:40:04.810]
I knew it.

[02:40:06.050 --> 02:40:07.210]
145 and 560,

[02:40:07.290 --> 02:40:08.670]
WQA and 567,

[02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.510]
0560,

[02:40:09.670 --> 02:40:11.970]
0560 on the AT&T WARS this line.

[02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:13.410]
Here's plantation.

[02:40:13.730 --> 02:40:13.890]
Hello.

[02:40:14.350 --> 02:40:15.010]
How you doing, Nell?

[02:40:15.090 --> 02:40:15.250]
Great.

[02:40:15.730 --> 02:40:17.010]
Uh, you know,

[02:40:17.570 --> 02:40:18.850]
listen to you for a long time,

[02:40:18.990 --> 02:40:19.570]
very long time.

[02:40:19.750 --> 02:40:20.090]
I'm, uh,

[02:40:20.450 --> 02:40:21.690]
I'm even being first of all,

[02:40:21.790 --> 02:40:22.410]
before most,

[02:40:22.570 --> 02:40:22.950]
I'm, uh,

[02:40:23.390 --> 02:40:23.710]
sort of.

[02:40:24.810 --> 02:40:26.390]
I was sort of, uh,

[02:40:26.890 --> 02:40:28.770]
very educated and articulate one.

[02:40:28.890 --> 02:40:30.390]
You're a shortstop or a sparser?

[02:40:30.550 --> 02:40:30.730]
What?

[02:40:31.010 --> 02:40:32.230]
I've got to say that anyways.

[02:40:32.470 --> 02:40:32.790]
I say that.

[02:40:32.930 --> 02:40:33.290]
Sparser.

[02:40:33.670 --> 02:40:34.630]
Okay, I got it.

[02:40:34.630 --> 02:40:35.250]
Got it now.

[02:40:35.770 --> 02:40:35.870]
Um,

[02:40:36.290 --> 02:40:37.370]
I used to live in Toronto years ago.

[02:40:37.650 --> 02:40:37.850]
Right.

[02:40:38.170 --> 02:40:38.610]
And, uh,

[02:40:38.650 --> 02:40:39.110]
we just say,

[02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:39.870]
Spowe's for sure.

[02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:40.430]
Okay.

[02:40:40.670 --> 02:40:41.250]
We can do that.

[02:40:41.590 --> 02:40:42.970]
Living Toronto for a long time.

[02:40:43.070 --> 02:40:43.190]
Yeah.

[02:40:43.610 --> 02:40:44.410]
Back in the park,

[02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:44.930]
Gilmore,

[02:40:45.150 --> 02:40:45.650]
Andrew Tuck,

[02:40:45.890 --> 02:40:46.530]
Pot Vendée.

[02:40:46.710 --> 02:40:46.870]
Right.

[02:40:47.130 --> 02:40:48.290]
I had those two great years, man.

[02:40:48.370 --> 02:40:49.290]
Oh, can you believe that?

[02:40:49.470 --> 02:40:51.070]
Before Cliff let your lost his mind, right?

[02:40:51.230 --> 02:40:51.390]
Exactly.

[02:40:51.650 --> 02:40:52.910]
Gilmore was like a man of the best.

[02:40:53.050 --> 02:40:53.210]
Right.

[02:40:53.510 --> 02:40:54.010]
But, uh,

[02:40:54.610 --> 02:40:55.910]
you know, I got these panther games.

[02:40:56.310 --> 02:40:57.430]
And he's, uh, you know,

[02:40:57.790 --> 02:40:58.370]
these, uh,

[02:40:59.030 --> 02:40:59.890]
human beings of the white

[02:41:00.370 --> 02:41:00.730]
persuasion.

[02:41:00.890 --> 02:41:01.370]
Look at you like,

[02:41:01.810 --> 02:41:02.530]
you know,

[02:41:02.990 --> 02:41:04.030]
they're looking me like, uh,

[02:41:04.030 --> 02:41:04.770]
what do you know?

[02:41:05.230 --> 02:41:06.170]
Let's see what they don't understand.

[02:41:06.330 --> 02:41:07.810]
I know more about hockey than they

[02:41:07.810 --> 02:41:08.610]
have in a little pink.

[02:41:08.730 --> 02:41:09.290]
Well, that's for sure.

[02:41:09.350 --> 02:41:10.190]
Cause you're from a real hockey.

[02:41:10.390 --> 02:41:10.670]
You sit there.

[02:41:10.670 --> 02:41:11.690]
You go culture.

[02:41:11.810 --> 02:41:11.930]
Yeah.

[02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:13.050]
I'm not even worried about that.

[02:41:13.710 --> 02:41:14.150]
But, um,

[02:41:14.450 --> 02:41:15.290]
I used to live in a, uh,

[02:41:15.430 --> 02:41:15.690]
Malton.

[02:41:16.490 --> 02:41:16.850]
Yeah.

[02:41:17.390 --> 02:41:17.710]
Yeah.

[02:41:17.770 --> 02:41:18.430]
I lived in Malton.

[02:41:18.550 --> 02:41:19.270]
My wife's, uh,

[02:41:19.610 --> 02:41:19.810]
you know,

[02:41:19.870 --> 02:41:20.390]
she's Spanish.

[02:41:20.570 --> 02:41:21.410]
So she does hair.

[02:41:21.490 --> 02:41:22.730]
She used to do Michael Peck of hair.

[02:41:22.930 --> 02:41:23.130]
Really?

[02:41:23.430 --> 02:41:24.010]
Michael Pecker.

[02:41:24.190 --> 02:41:24.410]
Yeah.

[02:41:24.690 --> 02:41:24.890]
Yeah.

[02:41:25.150 --> 02:41:26.550]
Number 27, Buffalo Savory.

[02:41:26.550 --> 02:41:27.010]
There you go.

[02:41:27.230 --> 02:41:27.630]
There you go.

[02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:28.590]
But, um,

[02:41:28.630 --> 02:41:29.470]
I was listening to this morning.

[02:41:29.470 --> 02:41:31.270]
I could not believe it.

[02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:33.230]
And I think that's, uh,

[02:41:33.870 --> 02:41:35.390]
it's a, you're telling me it wasn't

[02:41:35.390 --> 02:41:35.670]
Hank.

[02:41:36.210 --> 02:41:37.330]
But if it was Hank,

[02:41:37.330 --> 02:41:39.310]
I'd be very surprised and embarrassed for him.

[02:41:40.030 --> 02:41:41.070]
You know, that was ridiculous.

[02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:41.690]
Yeah.

[02:41:41.950 --> 02:41:43.130]
Very, very ridiculous.

[02:41:43.730 --> 02:41:44.350]
But, uh,

[02:41:44.530 --> 02:41:47.170]
and even more ridiculous is all these, uh,

[02:41:47.610 --> 02:41:48.850]
sports fangs calling in here.

[02:41:49.050 --> 02:41:49.670]
You know, I mean, you know,

[02:41:49.730 --> 02:41:51.190]
the people that I know nothing about sports,

[02:41:51.350 --> 02:41:52.870]
I could come on here and breathlessly

[02:41:52.870 --> 02:41:54.890]
in out that the entire dolphin team

[02:41:54.890 --> 02:41:56.310]
has been traded for,

[02:41:56.390 --> 02:41:57.530]
you're filling the blank, you know,

[02:41:57.610 --> 02:41:59.370]
for 600 draptors and,

[02:41:59.370 --> 02:42:00.870]
and the lines in the Swiss board,

[02:42:00.870 --> 02:42:02.890]
uh, probably lighten up in the four lines here.

[02:42:03.150 --> 02:42:04.130]
I mean, it's pathetic.

[02:42:04.130 --> 02:42:05.390]
These people have got no lives.

[02:42:05.490 --> 02:42:06.050]
They don't get it.

[02:42:06.130 --> 02:42:06.410]
Right.

[02:42:06.770 --> 02:42:06.910]
You know,

[02:42:07.210 --> 02:42:08.170]
everybody can take a joke.

[02:42:08.330 --> 02:42:10.090]
Well, you got to do as good a well-panther game

[02:42:10.090 --> 02:42:11.790]
and just see the way that this crowd behaves.

[02:42:12.370 --> 02:42:12.970]
And, uh,

[02:42:13.610 --> 02:42:15.170]
Nick, we get to have a team here for 100 years.

[02:42:15.270 --> 02:42:16.330]
They'll still never understand it.

[02:42:16.350 --> 02:42:16.950]
They don't get it.

[02:42:17.110 --> 02:42:17.470]
It's unreal.

[02:42:17.930 --> 02:42:18.270]
It's unreal.

[02:42:18.490 --> 02:42:20.150]
Yeah, here's Joe going on with, uh,

[02:42:20.410 --> 02:42:22.190]
Gildi is getting buried and deforeses

[02:42:22.190 --> 02:42:22.790]
and destroyed.

[02:42:23.310 --> 02:42:23.610]
Rehab,

[02:42:23.710 --> 02:42:23.910]
right?

[02:42:24.010 --> 02:42:24.390]
Every's done.

[02:42:24.890 --> 02:42:25.190]
Yeah.

[02:42:25.570 --> 02:42:26.130]
I don't know.

[02:42:26.250 --> 02:42:26.910]
I don't know what's going on,

[02:42:27.030 --> 02:42:27.330]
but, uh,

[02:42:27.470 --> 02:42:28.530]
just wanted to call you and say a little.

[02:42:28.530 --> 02:42:28.930]
Okay.

[02:42:29.150 --> 02:42:29.650]
All righty.

[02:42:29.670 --> 02:42:30.370]
See you on Truth Street.

[02:42:30.570 --> 02:42:30.810]
Bye-bye.

[02:42:30.930 --> 02:42:31.010]
Not.

[02:42:31.510 --> 02:42:31.690]
Okay.

[02:42:31.850 --> 02:42:32.450]
5, 6, 7,

[02:42:32.450 --> 02:42:33.350]
A lot of open lines here.

[02:42:33.430 --> 02:42:34.250]
600 open lines.

[02:42:34.330 --> 02:42:34.930]
All of a sudden,

[02:42:35.150 --> 02:42:36.270]
since they got the real story.

[02:42:36.410 --> 02:42:36.690]
Okay.

[02:42:37.070 --> 02:42:37.750]
5, 6, 7,

[02:42:37.830 --> 02:42:38.490]
0, 5, 60,

[02:42:38.630 --> 02:42:39.270]
0, 5, 60,

[02:42:39.830 --> 02:42:41.070]
on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:42:42.790 --> 02:42:43.590]
What did I do wrong?

[02:42:43.690 --> 02:42:44.450]
Oh, I got to pawn off.

[02:42:44.550 --> 02:42:45.010]
That's okay.

[02:42:46.170 --> 02:42:46.690]
That's okay.

[02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:48.170]
I don't want to do any hockey stuff here.

[02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:49.130]
These people don't know from it.

[02:42:49.150 --> 02:42:49.970]
They don't understand it.

[02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.750]
They don't care about it.

[02:42:51.050 --> 02:42:51.950]
They're more important

[02:42:51.950 --> 02:42:52.930]
that they go to their shader

[02:42:52.930 --> 02:42:54.210]
and drink the wine and sit around

[02:42:54.210 --> 02:42:55.250]
doing old wives' tails.

[02:42:55.370 --> 02:42:56.230]
You know, the old bubble mice.

[02:42:58.190 --> 02:43:00.090]
Very, very revealing to be in that place.

[02:43:00.250 --> 02:43:01.770]
Life's not one of the biggest fly openers.

[02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:02.790]
I mean, you know, you think somebody

[02:43:02.790 --> 02:43:04.010]
who has been here as long as I have.

[02:43:04.010 --> 02:43:05.750]
I know all the ropes by now, but not true.

[02:43:06.390 --> 02:43:07.310]
The longer you hear the more,

[02:43:07.430 --> 02:43:09.450]
you really get a very, very deep understanding

[02:43:09.450 --> 02:43:10.310]
of these people

[02:43:10.310 --> 02:43:11.290]
and their priorities

[02:43:11.290 --> 02:43:12.350]
and what's important to them

[02:43:12.350 --> 02:43:13.190]
and what is not.

[02:43:14.550 --> 02:43:15.290]
Here's Cutler Ridge.

[02:43:15.470 --> 02:43:15.550]
Hello.

[02:43:16.190 --> 02:43:16.690]
Hey, you, Neil.

[02:43:16.930 --> 02:43:17.230]
Yes, sir.

[02:43:17.370 --> 02:43:18.350]
Hey, how about them, Panthers?

[02:43:18.750 --> 02:43:19.170]
They suck.

[02:43:19.530 --> 02:43:20.430]
Yeah, that's what I said.

[02:43:21.270 --> 02:43:24.030]
Hey, don't you think we should get rid of melumbi?

[02:43:24.450 --> 02:43:25.230]
No, I do not.

[02:43:25.230 --> 02:43:26.770]
Why do you say that?

[02:43:26.930 --> 02:43:28.290]
Why does he want to rag on him?

[02:43:28.610 --> 02:43:30.050]
Melumbi is a guy that goes out here

[02:43:30.050 --> 02:43:31.490]
and he works hard.

[02:43:31.610 --> 02:43:32.250]
He tries hard.

[02:43:32.330 --> 02:43:33.170]
He overachieves.

[02:43:33.410 --> 02:43:35.410]
He's got, uh, 17 or 18 goals.

[02:43:35.770 --> 02:43:36.170]
He goes on.

[02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:37.150]
He scores important goals.

[02:43:37.410 --> 02:43:39.090]
At least Melumbi gives you 100% of it.

[02:43:39.190 --> 02:43:40.230]
He's not, he's slow.

[02:43:40.350 --> 02:43:40.890]
He's frustrating.

[02:43:41.150 --> 02:43:42.270]
But still, he goes out there.

[02:43:42.310 --> 02:43:43.370]
He hits, you know,

[02:43:43.390 --> 02:43:44.230]
he plays a tough physical.

[02:43:44.330 --> 02:43:45.150]
Yeah, I agree with you.

[02:43:45.150 --> 02:43:45.590]
He gives you an effort.

[02:43:45.830 --> 02:43:47.990]
He's not just a figure skater like Victor Coslov.

[02:43:48.590 --> 02:43:49.290]
I agree with that.

[02:43:49.410 --> 02:43:49.450]
I agree with that.

[02:43:49.450 --> 02:43:50.550]
I remember that little ass sucker

[02:43:50.550 --> 02:43:51.950]
gelding getting on about a month ago,

[02:43:52.090 --> 02:43:53.850]
talking about who's going to be a free agent

[02:43:53.850 --> 02:43:55.010]
who they got to reside next year.

[02:43:55.010 --> 02:43:57.670]
All Victor Coslov's got him on big, big bucks next year.

[02:43:57.870 --> 02:43:59.590]
Who's going to get Victor Coslov big bucks?

[02:43:59.610 --> 02:44:00.570]
What for a figure skating?

[02:44:00.810 --> 02:44:01.050]
It's true.

[02:44:01.190 --> 02:44:03.030]
What's he going to do with the Rock Kets on ice on ABC

[02:44:03.030 --> 02:44:03.590]
or something?

[02:44:03.850 --> 02:44:05.330]
What the hell are they going to pay him big bucks for?

[02:44:05.530 --> 02:44:07.450]
He's the biggest disappoint in the whole organization.

[02:44:07.890 --> 02:44:08.790]
Hey, another point though.

[02:44:09.150 --> 02:44:10.210]
Let's get another Alex six.

[02:44:10.410 --> 02:44:11.050]
That guy's a player.

[02:44:11.190 --> 02:44:12.210]
He's, uh, he's a hard,

[02:44:12.210 --> 02:44:12.770]
that we know about.

[02:44:12.890 --> 02:44:13.210]
How about those guys?

[02:44:13.330 --> 02:44:13.670]
That's right.

[02:44:13.790 --> 02:44:15.130]
How about that when he came out of the box

[02:44:15.130 --> 02:44:16.690]
and lead that hit on that guy that, uh,

[02:44:16.690 --> 02:44:17.570]
he went in for the good.

[02:44:17.570 --> 02:44:18.350]
Well, Alex six.

[02:44:18.450 --> 02:44:20.030]
Those are the kind of guys he'd on the team.

[02:44:20.170 --> 02:44:20.890]
Back guy right there.

[02:44:21.070 --> 02:44:22.210]
He did not come for 28.

[02:44:22.210 --> 02:44:23.470]
They cost the puck up his center.

[02:44:23.570 --> 02:44:23.670]
Right.

[02:44:23.750 --> 02:44:25.350]
And turn the whole momentum of the game around.

[02:44:25.510 --> 02:44:27.070]
And throw him out with that bad mistake.

[02:44:27.350 --> 02:44:28.370]
Let's send him to a.

[02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:29.570]
There we go.

[02:44:29.670 --> 02:44:29.850]
Okay.

[02:44:30.210 --> 02:44:30.470]
There you go.

[02:44:30.470 --> 02:44:30.470]

[02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:31.090]
Bye.

[02:44:32.790 --> 02:44:34.310]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[02:44:34.490 --> 02:44:36.770]
Pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:44:37.010 --> 02:44:37.450]
Oh, yeah.

[02:44:37.490 --> 02:44:38.970]
They're all up serve over there at the Cleveland Clinic.

[02:44:39.250 --> 02:44:39.610]
Too bad.

[02:44:40.430 --> 02:44:41.030]
Too bad.

[02:44:41.170 --> 02:44:42.810]
Maybe if I had some follow through over there.

[02:44:43.050 --> 02:44:44.550]
Maybe if I got more than a lick and a smear

[02:44:44.550 --> 02:44:45.710]
the few times I've been over there.

[02:44:45.810 --> 02:44:47.250]
Except when I had my hemorrhoid problem.

[02:44:48.270 --> 02:44:49.830]
Maybe I'd have a little bit better opinion.

[02:44:49.890 --> 02:44:50.110]
Okay.

[02:44:50.110 --> 02:44:50.810]
Like I said before,

[02:44:50.810 --> 02:44:54.010]
I haven't got the fogiest idea of what

[02:44:54.010 --> 02:44:56.730]
Paul Belbray's knee looked like when he came here from Russia.

[02:44:57.650 --> 02:44:59.650]
Or after the first ACL with Dr.

[02:44:59.770 --> 02:45:00.010]
Rotarian.

[02:45:00.270 --> 02:45:01.270]
Or what it looked like a week ago.

[02:45:01.490 --> 02:45:03.450]
All I know is that before he went off to Alabama,

[02:45:03.850 --> 02:45:06.150]
Rimmer saw his knee and he said it was pretty damn swollen.

[02:45:06.490 --> 02:45:07.030]
And the knee too.

[02:45:08.690 --> 02:45:09.970]
So what's all the wine all about?

[02:45:10.070 --> 02:45:11.390]
I didn't make any comments about that.

[02:45:11.430 --> 02:45:12.590]
But we got some very like I said,

[02:45:12.650 --> 02:45:14.950]
it seems that everybody associated with that Panther

[02:45:14.950 --> 02:45:18.250]
organization is so sensitive and so uptight.

[02:45:19.970 --> 02:45:22.610]
Which always makes it a good idea to go out and lie to everybody

[02:45:22.610 --> 02:45:23.690]
and then come back a couple days.

[02:45:23.850 --> 02:45:25.010]
Oh, well, we had a lie because

[02:45:25.010 --> 02:45:26.390]
Yada Yada fell into the blanket.

[02:45:26.390 --> 02:45:27.470]
Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[02:45:28.530 --> 02:45:31.950]
I think this town has been BS and DM'd to death.

[02:45:32.230 --> 02:45:32.450]
Okay.

[02:45:32.730 --> 02:45:33.490]
Maybe I'm wrong.

[02:45:34.110 --> 02:45:35.110]
But I don't think so.

[02:45:35.870 --> 02:45:38.850]
I think we've had enough BM to fill up my whole backyard.

[02:45:40.510 --> 02:45:41.210]
See you Brian.

[02:45:41.550 --> 02:45:42.670]
And don't forget the brother with you.

[02:45:42.810 --> 02:45:42.930]
Okay.

[02:45:43.250 --> 02:45:43.830]
The evil twin.
