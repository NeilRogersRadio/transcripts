[00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.020]
C-40, C-40, C-40.

[00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.340]
Long way to go.

[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.020]
4-Tradio 560 W2AM Miami-4-Sitterdale.

[00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:07.320]
D-40.

[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.220]
The Neil Rodgers Show.

[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.060]
DuTak-Taniel called 560-0560 toll-free for need and power.

[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.560]
More pound 560 on your cell phone.

[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.340]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show,

[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.400]
do not necessarily reflect those of you.

[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.240]
QAM, easily that position.

[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.180]
Or the easily brought down group.

[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.180]
Now Neil, 560-0560.

[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.320]
QAM.

[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.840]
Oh my god, if you play Hank over again, I'm gonna fucking throw off.

[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.520]
Forced Fag Radio.

[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.540]
We'll never be the same.

[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.260]
Starting this Monday on 560-WQAM.

[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.140]
It's the Brian and Terry Murray Show.

[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.360]
6 at 10AM Monday through Friday.

[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.340]
Only on 560-WQAM.

[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.500]
Now.

[00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.540]

[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.760]
That's what I designed for.

[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.340]
Out in here, it's the Tuesday day again.

[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.140]
QAM.

[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.760]
Oh my god, yo.

[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.900]
That's what we paid for.

[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.800]
With tickets called 560.

[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.500]
We've been waiting for so many long.

[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.180]
Just being a holiday kid and stuff.

[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.520]
All day you want.

[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.000]
That's what I'm gonna do now.

[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.880]
Like that, it's wrong to wait until I get tough.

[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.700]
It's out there, it's gone.

[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.880]
Stop.

[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.340]
Whoa, you got it, yo.

[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.340]
It's not fun.

[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.900]
He's gonna wear these on the sit again.

[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.040]
Stop.

[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.000]
Whoa.

[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.960]
Huh.

[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.420]
That's what we're getting for.

[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.340]
Oh, there ain't no here, whoa.

[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.120]
Stop.

[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:45.200]
Whoa.

[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.600]
Well, yeah, yeah.

[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.640]
That's what we're getting for.

[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.240]
We're all on duty to take it.

[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.200]
Stop.

[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.280]
Whoa.

[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.560]
Good guy, yo.

[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.620]
We shall blow the jet ice.

[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.560]
Bring all the soft troopers.

[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.360]
Stop.

[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.340]
Whoa.

[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.160]
Whoa.

[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.880]
It's increasing.

[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.300]
There's more in.

[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.240]
I'm just gonna get the hockey stick stuff.

[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.860]
Got it.

[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.880]
Let's get the recovery down.

[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.000]
Right, 30 to go.

[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.960]
The devil caught him and teed for the old baby.

[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.160]
What a date this one.

[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.940]
That person.

[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.460]
And right away for a durmick, the huge stable in the arc

[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.600]
or his first time to eat, was struck in the dare's arena.

[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.440]
Well, alright, sports fast.

[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.640]
When I said that, it Marty struck as God, baby.

[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.820]
I told you that that's the hard ass Doug McLean.

[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.460]
He would listen to me.

[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.320]
He got his ass fired.

[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.040]
Nice going, Doug, you jackass, you hard ass.

[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.040]
The problem with the people in this town, too many hard asses, too many experts.

[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.540]
They all know all the answers and then all of a sudden they want to get in their ass can.

[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.840]
Don't see them no more.

[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.320]
Because they won't listen to anybody, including experts like...

[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.300]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.680]
Man, what again, that was last night, huh?

[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.320]
So now it's the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Toronto.

[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.020]
May police starting Friday night at the pier canter of the center in Toronto.

[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.260]
And then in the wee hours of the morning,

[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.940]
it must have been finally up here at Turgentown, gets a greasy goal.

[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.260]
I just saw it on CNN there.

[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.320]
Against the Nikolai Habubulin, as the guy said, on CNN International.

[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.180]
Habubulin.

[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.740]
Greasy goal, they're kind of a knuckleball shot and just caught the corner late in the first overtime.

[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.020]
And St. Louis comes back from a 3-1 deficit, beat Spenix, the biggest chokers in the history of mankind, and lose on.

[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.340]
Any interest in the hockey playoffs?

[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.760]
No.

[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.740]
How the pantheon is doing?

[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.960]
No.

[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.940]
Okay, speaking of any interest, oh man.

[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.860]
Got another full play here today, by the way. WQAM.

[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.060]
Hello.

[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.780]
Yes, sir.

[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.120]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.400]
Great.

[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.320]
Got a short show today, so we got to really speed it up.

[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.460]
Yeah, I know, this was fast.

[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.220]
And it's in take your feet right now.

[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.860]
Listen, the two playoff games that I've watched, the series, excuse me.

[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.080]
Yes?

[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.420]
Toronto Philadelphia.

[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.240]
Great series, but last night was just a icing on the cake.

[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.220]
That was a great game.

[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.160]
It was, man.

[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.720]
Hey, listen.

[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.460]
How'd you like it?

[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.540]
Johnny Strockah, how'd going to assist against the number one star?

[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.820]
And how'd you like it?

[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.460]
Hey, you know, you know what, it brings me out though?

[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.160]
Jarmie Yogurt.

[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.920]
Pull growing.

[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.420]
Yeah.

[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.660]
It's been out for four games.

[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.140]
And you got these little baseball players, you know, that they have a pull growing, they have a thumbnail that's kind of hurt.

[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.420]
And they sit out for 10 games.

[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.740]
Right.

[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.240]
Marty, excuse me.

[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.600]
Jarmie Yogurt sits out for four games, comes back, gets a game where it gets to assist.

[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.960]
Plus that, Marty Strockah has six goals in the series.

[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.320]
Yeah.

[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.780]
He's leading score in a playoffs now, and also leading goal scores.

[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.300]
He's got most points, and he's either tied or leading in goal, six.

[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.620]
I hope Captain B.M. is Sergeant T.M.

[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.500]
Take a look at that.

[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.780]
Okay, pal, don't forget their show starts Monday morning.

[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.940]
All right, buddy.

[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.200]
There you go.

[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.820]
There's a guy who's got his act together.

[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.640]
He's interested in the hockey playoffs, not some stupid Star Wars movie.

[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.020]
I'm sorry.

[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.000]
Sorry, George.

[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.260]
Well, I mean, you know, I understand that some people want to relive their second childhood.

[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.840]
They never want to grow up that kind of stuff.

[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.020]
I mean, I enjoyed watching the Batman and Robin series over and over again.

[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.320]
That's because Robin was wearing those tight green tights, you know.

[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.980]
So, and now, of course, you find out about Mark Campbell.

[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.940]
That stands back, and I can't stand it.

[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.800]
That's why you like the new one, because he's not in it.

[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.400]
So you can watch it and feel like a favorite part.

[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.640]
The fact that Mark Campbell is not going to be in it.

[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.100]
Well, he's not born yet, right?

[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.240]
Hey, by the way, don't forget Monday. It's WQA and the prequel.

[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.620]
Oh!

[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.420]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.160]
Before they had a transmitter.

[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.740]
Oh, that was already in that condition.

[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.940]
Well, I asked Mark mostly this morning about, he came in this morning,

[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.220]
one of the good guys from Power 96.

[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.580]
We got two or three over there.

[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.300]
And I asked him about the foot of you, while 100, he said,

[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.020]
He's an asshole.

[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.380]
Yeah.

[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.820]
He went on and on.

[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.860]
I said, calm down, Mark.

[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.580]
All I did was mention the athletes foot.

[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.200]
He's an asshole.

[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.780]
Oh, man.

[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.460]
He just went nuts. He went off on them.

[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.180]
Do I, do I, do I, dare mention this, by the way, this big ad?

[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.900]
Because I'm always the scouring through the papers for things that I think will be of interest.

[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.080]
Well, it's a going out of business sale for an establishment that was once a sponsor.

[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.260]
Not on this show, by the way.

[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.280]
I just thought I would mention that.

[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.140]
You know something if they would have advertised on the near-roger show,

[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.180]
these people might only not be going out of business.

[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.520]
They might be making them a money handover lip wrist.

[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.000]
You know that?

[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.240]
Even though their prices were too high.

[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.580]
Who is telling me that?

[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:15.520]
Or John Penis?

[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.560]
What?

[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.980]
Well, you don't have to worry about it.

[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.760]
They're going out of business.

[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.200]
He's not going to have to worry about, was that his account?

[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.800]
Well, that would be kind of embarrassing if it was his account.

[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.940]
And then he would come in here and tell me that their prices were too high.

[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.780]
And they were charging like twice what you could buy the stuff in public sport.

[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.100]
I don't want to mention, um,

[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.240]
and more.

[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.580]
They'd go out of business sale.

[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.980]
It was.

[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.600]
Yeah, it's called, and more.

[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.420]
Your,

[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.960]
and super store.

[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.240]
And it says in the bottom of the page here,

[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.160]
we couldn't have done it without the Humper, whatever that means.

[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.620]
Right after it says going out of business sale, what does that mean?

[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.580]
Defaulted in the spots, too.

[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.180]
That didn't help.

[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.820]
Hey, listen, if you think I'm going to lay off on the morning and afternoon shows on this station,

[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.700]
look what happened.

[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.540]
I finally started really ripping them and asked,

[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.500]
they went through the roof.

[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.260]
That's right.

[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:08.000]
We need, you know, I heard Hank that one day he was kind of a little cranky about the fact that we rip each other on this station.

[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.220]
That's what the audience wants.

[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.700]
They don't want that ass sucking that goes on too much.

[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.700]
We got plenty of other ass suckers in this town.

[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.540]
Ass suckers are a dime a dozen of FATSO.

[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:17.620]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.500]
Hey, stupid.

[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:18.860]
Yeah.

[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.420]
They want a little fighting this.

[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.620]
They want a little, you know.

[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.000]
And of course you don't have to make it up on your own station like yesterday.

[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.580]
Hank's all worked up about that ball game between the Orioles and the

[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.620]
National Team, which we're not mentioning that word on this show anymore.

[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.800]
Well, I'm not.

[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.180]
Great.

[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.780]
Well, today is Cinco de Mayo, but that's a Mexican holiday.

[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.540]
Yeah, no problem.

[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.100]
I think it was great Mexicans like Luis Miguel and anybody else.

[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.300]
Any other great Mexicans?

[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:42.640]
No.

[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.680]
Luis Miguel and, um, uh, huh?

[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.960]
There must be somebody.

[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.900]
There must be some other great Mexican goddammit.

[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.700]
Can you name one?

[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.400]
Can you name one great Mexican?

[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:55.680]
No.

[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.700]
Come on beside Luis Miguel.

[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.720]
There's going to be somebody.

[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.340]
We have any Mexicans in this town.

[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.920]
Although I did notice yesterday in the paper it's at all Cinco de Mayo taking off big in this town.

[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.260]
Why?

[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:05.980]
Why is that?

[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.280]
Probably done in the Redlands,

[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.500]
Lee your city.

[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.040]
You mean the great pickers down there?

[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.660]
We have, I bet you we got some Mexicans in this town who are like real upstanding citizens.

[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.960]
He's laughing, by the way.

[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.260]
That's because he's a f***.

[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.660]
Eight minutes past 10 at 560 WQM.

[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.560]
We got a short show today.

[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.300]
We got the Marlins.

[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.480]
By the way, nice school at Marlins.

[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.620]
I want to point out the consistency is what life is all about.

[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.520]
They are four and 14 at home, two and seven on the road.

[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.720]
Six and 21 overall.

[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.000]
But you notice it's exactly the same ratio, two and seven, four and 14.

[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:47.180]
And of course the fact that they played 18 home games the only nine on the road doesn't bode too well for, you know, six and 21 right now.

[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.140]
It could be like eight and 35 before too much longer.

[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.640]
So this afternoon 1230 the pregame show won a clock.

[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.000]
The Milwaukee Brewers who have now won what is it?

[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.600]
10, 11 in the row, 11 in the row.

[00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.420]
Against the Marlins.

[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.440]
Milwaukee Brewers over at P.P. Park against our Florida Marlins.

[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.020]
Any interest?

[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.220]
No.

[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:03.940]
What's the matter?

[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.200]
No.

[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.640]
Please listen, it's not on TV.

[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.180]
Will you listen?

[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:06.440]
No.

[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.240]
We paid you $100.

[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.060]
What do you listen?

[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:08.360]
No.

[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.440]
If we paid you $5,000.

[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:10.780]
No.

[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.620]
Speaking of big cash, if you want to win some big cash head for Hollywood Seminole Gaming,

[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.480]
where winners have recently walked away with big fat six figure jackpods.

[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.360]
Oh, can you see that they have fake?

[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.360]
They don't swim up, they don't even shake.

[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.000]
I don't know why some people will stand on a rubbery path.

[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.280]
I don't do that.

[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.500]
I don't do that.

[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.060]
That would turn into a down-down path.

[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.080]
It's like you've got your find out.

[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.720]
The nature's a party-weigher.

[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.280]
I don't do that.

[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.640]
And then I'll scream.

[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.720]
I'll let you throw a song you like you feel.

[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.680]
Like the tigers on your saw.

[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.320]
They feel the same.

[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.220]
All right.

[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.880]
And the last song is full.

[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.900]
Our film was called Sixth Secret too.

[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.420]
It's from a text that makes those rubber movie models and play.

[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.700]
From guy days that they like it that way.

[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.640]
But I just can't understand.

[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.820]
Why they like to speak my rubber face?

[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.260]
And buy product from the L.

[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.980]
And okay, another thing.

[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.200]
I can't stand it when they look that way.

[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.100]
The way you hold is the ugly song.

[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.800]
You'll get the awesome.

[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.280]
I don't mind if they head it down.

[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.300]
As long as I can speak one of my mouth.

[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.660]
And when I cover up the air.

[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.780]
I want my hands on the same song.

[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.620]
And when I cover up the air.

[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.820]
I want my hands on the same song.

[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.700]
Yeah, I got my hands on something soft right now.

[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.680]
1015 to 560 WDQM.

[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.460]
So they got beard, they got soda, they got what?

[00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.180]
I'm talking about **** and more.

[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.480]
Out of business and more.

[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.120]
Full page color and what I tell you one thing.

[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.260]
What does that mean when you can afford?

[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.620]
You know how much money that must cost?

[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:08.680]
Huh?

[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.540]
What is this? The sunset nor the hero?

[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:12.880]
Or are they keeping it?

[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.280]
I don't even know.

[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.340]
Well, it's one of the two major papers here.

[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.580]
That cost I believe about five grand at least.

[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.280]
Huh? Yeah.

[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.680]
And of course it's multicolor.

[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.420]
It's like red and yellow and black.

[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.900]
Anybody out there fill in the black?

[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:26.900]
On and more.

[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.540]
They're going out of business.

[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.280]
Having a big sale.

[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.100]
Let's give them a big plug.

[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:30.500]
Okay.

[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.980]
Try to make up for those bad spots they paid for on the station.

[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.500]
25% off.

[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.860]
Now they're getting those prices down there.

[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.460]
If they were giving you these prices in the first place,

[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.540]
they might not be going out of business.

[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.220]
But, um, and more.

[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.600]
25% off in all wine, beer and spirits.

[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.460]
They got wine, they got sodas, they got stuff to drink.

[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.780]
50% off in all cigars food more.

[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.380]
We better not say that because nickel get all better.

[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:51.900]
You don't care.

[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.480]
See there they go again,

[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.240]
giving those cheap cigars spots on here.

[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.300]
This isn't even a paid spot.

[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.040]
This is just a plug for our friends at

[00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:58.700]
and more.

[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:00.940]
Hurry, everything must go.

[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:01.820]
They got three locations.

[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.340]
I haven't sure a 21-0, uh,

[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.180]
210-55, this game, Boulevard,

[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.160]
South of Gulf Stream Park.

[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.480]
Port Lauderdale, 17-40 North Federal Highway,

[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.460]
behind Piroledding Port,

[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.540]
and Pembroke Pines,

[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.560]
118-54 Pines, uh, Boulevard,

[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.240]
uh, Cross-Pembroke Lake Small,

[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.160]
right at Flamingo.

[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.080]
Is that a pretty good spot?

[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.120]
Huh?

[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.560]
It's not even a paid commercial.

[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.020]
I'm just trying to plug our friends at

[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.040]
more because I feel bad they're going out of business

[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.800]
because they advertise on the wrong shows.

[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.020]
Huh?

[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.420]
Well, seriously, it's his right on the bottom of the thing.

[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.540]
It's got an asterisk, he said.

[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.300]
We couldn't have done it without you, Hank.

[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.200]
Huh?

[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.280]
That's right on the page.

[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:36.920]
That was fun.

[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.220]
Yeah.

[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:38.560]
Just a joke.

[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.240]
He just gets so sensitive and emotional.

[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.440]
And of course, he's already got enough problems for

[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.640]
Humber because he's got to come on after the Marlin game.

[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.960]
Today, wow, I wouldn't wish that on anybody.

[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.520]
That'll bring them back down to Earth after the day you fork.

[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.200]
Weekend, beyond the, you know, Kentucky,

[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.140]
Derby Telecast, ABC, all that stuff.

[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.700]
Sitting in there with Jim McKay watching,

[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.600]
watching Jim McKay with his trembling hands.

[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.460]
How would you like to have seen before he bit the big one?

[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.960]
Howard Co. Sell trying to shake hands with Jim McKay.

[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.920]
You think they ever actually touched any flesh?

[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.040]
Do you think they ever was, you know,

[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.180]
and how about like a three-way with Muhammad Ali?

[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.680]
Janet Reno and Michael J. Fox.

[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.840]
Oh, there he goes, making fun of people's at now.

[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.020]
I mean, it's one of those things.

[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.800]
It's not easy to shake somebody's hand.

[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.660]
What about the Pope?

[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.060]
Yeah, I'll get him in there too, okay?

[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.720]
Now, don't get a guy in a dress in.

[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:24.480]
I know, start wondering.

[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.820]
He might shake something else.

[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.280]
Here's Miami Lakes. Hello.

[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:29.900]
You got it.

[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:30.580]
Yes, sir, speaking.

[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.600]
Yeah, I got a candidate for your great Mexican category.

[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:35.000]
Okay.

[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.080]
His name's Jose Cuervo.

[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:37.900]
Are you familiar with him?

[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.220]
No.

[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.440]
Never heard of him.

[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.240]
Jose Cuervo?

[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.360]
You've got it, baby.

[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.200]
Well, who's that?

[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.360]
What kind of cigars does he make?

[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.820]
He makes tequila flavor cigars.

[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:48.360]
Yeah.

[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.220]
Yeah.

[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.140]
He makes tequila?

[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:50.980]
That's right.

[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:52.400]
A meal.

[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:52.940]
Yeah.

[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.320]
Can I call somebody a dish bag?

[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:54.840]
Okay.

[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.220]
5-6705-60, Pont 5-60 on a mobile one line.

[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.020]
It's Tinko de Mayo.

[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.180]
Come on, what's wrong with you people?

[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.380]
Let's honor the great Mexicans of the world.

[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.180]
Well, why do you give me a look like that?

[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.660]
You are so anti-Mexican just because you're a professional f***ing, you know,

[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.940]
which we don't say on the ear anymore,

[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.500]
because we're sick and tired of that crap.

[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.500]
Oh, two great letters to the editor, by the way,

[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.680]
and which paper, the Harold?

[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.480]
About that business over at Miami International.

[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.580]
See, if I never flew out of Miami International,

[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.720]
but I happen to be one of the most frequent customers,

[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.400]
I should have a frequent magazine buyer card for Miami International,

[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.600]
because I buy every tabloid.

[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.900]
Before we get on any trip,

[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.620]
going to Toronto, going out of town, going anywhere, going to Europe,

[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.720]
you buy all the tabloids, which is a lot of crap,

[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:34.640]
but it's fun reading.

[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:35.680]
Kills hours.

[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.380]
It's great.

[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.920]
And I just pick up whatever they got.

[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.480]
The examiner, the tatler, the sun, the inquirer.

[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.620]
I just pick them all up.

[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.900]
But boy, they got some hootspull over there.

[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:46.620]
There's a maniac.

[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.480]
He's right-wing f***ing s*** over there.

[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.160]
Trying to censor the stuff.

[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.080]
So there's a Bradley Berkman in Miami Beach,

[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.380]
and Doug Williams in Miami.

[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.960]
I'm not going to waste the time reading these letters to the editor this morning,

[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.860]
but right on target about these assholes trying to, like, you know,

[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.220]
little individual censors we got in this town.

[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.800]
Yeah, bring back that goddamn censorship board for the movies,

[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.520]
for everything, for books, for magazines.

[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:09.620]
That's what we need.

[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.760]
We'll have the cat-liquely deciding what you can read,

[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.820]
and what you can't read, and what you can listen to,

[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.660]
and what you can touch.

[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:17.580]
As in...

[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:17.920]
Brackdom.

[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:18.880]
Oh, yeah, they like that.

[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.020]
Okay, it's a f***ing s*** and more going out of business.

[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.600]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:25.980]
Hello?

[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:28.900]
Mobile in Miami?

[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.720]
Let's try it again.

[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:32.040]
Hello?

[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.280]
Yes, I had to send you to you, but with Miguel,

[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.240]
he's not Mexican, he's a Puerto Rican.

[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:37.900]
No, he's not.

[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.240]
He was born in Puerto Rico, but he's not Puerto Rican.

[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.240]
Well, he was born in Puerto Rico.

[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.520]
He was born what?

[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.020]
And his...

[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:45.480]
Puerto Rico.

[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.740]
His father was Mexican, his mother was Italian.

[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.200]
So he might have a little Puerto Rican in him, but that's his business.

[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.360]
See, there you go again, or start...

[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.640]
Now this guy must have been a professional.

[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:56.540]
It's like you.

[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.140]
He's not Puerto Rican, he was born in Puerto Rico.

[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.340]
Oh, there was Luis Miguel.

[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.640]
Oh, yeah, he's Puerto Rican.

[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.240]
No, he's not.

[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.180]
Oh, man.

[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.200]
Just because you hate the Puerto Ricans, and you can't...

[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:09.620]
I know.

[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.360]
I'm not the one that hates Puerto Ricans.

[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:11.820]
That's you.

[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:12.860]
I love the Puerto Ricans.

[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.920]
I have no problem with the Puerto Ricans.

[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.900]
I don't even know any Puerto Ricans, to be honest with you.

[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.820]
If we got any Puerto Ricans in the audience, call right now, okay?

[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.240]
And call your just stupid...

[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.500]
Whatever that word is.

[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.160]
Just don't know what it would meant, because you're the Puerto Rican,

[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:23.780]
and then you won't be able to...

[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.680]
So what's in that store?

[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.320]
Is it...

[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:25.820]
And more?

[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.400]
Well, we got plenty of things we're bleepin' today.

[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.540]
Come on, let's hear some Puerto Ricans today,

[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.840]
and I'll stick with it in my own day.

[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.000]
Well, now, what's the...

[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.640]
What's the big Puerto Ricans holiday?

[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.120]
Well, there must be something.

[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.240]
What do they celebrate?

[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.080]
National Switchblade Day?

[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.380]
They must have a day for something.

[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.600]
But what's the claim to fame for Puerto Rico?

[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.400]
Mexico, like the guy said, it's the killer.

[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.100]
It's Luis Miguel.

[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.920]
It's like a polco, those sunny beaches.

[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.580]
What's Puerto Rico's claim to fame?

[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.860]
Besides, they want to be the 50th-state, and we don't want them.

[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:55.900]
What's their claim to fame?

[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.240]
Besides, the Bronx.

[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.480]
Here's the mobile and four-letter deal.

[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:00.700]
Hello?

[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.920]
Yeah, I think the name of that place is

[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.460]
Debitges and Krishmour, I think.

[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.960]
I think I've seen it in the last few years.

[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.500]
Outstanding, sir.

[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.620]
Excellent job.

[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.620]
Yes, thank you.

[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.560]
No wonder they went out of business.

[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:11.420]
Oh.

[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:11.940]
Okay.

[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.700]
I wonder what ever happened, by the way, to that.

[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.440]
More on.

[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:16.700]
Yeah.

[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.540]
Won't hear him no more on this station.

[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.180]
Except maybe on some of those awful weekend ESPN shows.

[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.760]
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty.

[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.440]
We're searching for Puerto Ricans today.

[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.480]
Come on, let's hear a little pride.

[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.040]
A little nationalistic pride.

[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.260]
Though they don't have any.

[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.060]
Here's sunrise.

[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:34.400]
Hello?

[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:35.180]
Hi, Neil.

[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:35.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.480]
I think that the store and more is...

[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.120]
And more, yeah.

[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.660]
Right, just going out of business in Florida,

[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.140]
because they've got places in California and so forth.

[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.140]
But maybe they're not over priced over in California.

[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.180]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.560]
I mean, when you can go into publics and buy the same...

[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.580]
...for half price.

[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.620]
The discriminating South Florida shopper won't pay those prices.

[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:54.100]
Right.

[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.260]
I caught you in a lot of discrimination here.

[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.120]
Yeah, I caught you because I listened to you show Monday

[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:58.900]
and I couldn't call.

[00:17:59.040 --> 00:17:59.280]
Yeah.

[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.620]
But you were there for anybody else.

[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.880]
You taught my Cologne, Reigns.

[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.540]
I was in Cologne.

[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.120]
I stayed right across from the cathedral.

[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.340]
A giant cathedral that's there?

[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.080]
The Duelm.

[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:09.780]
The Duelm, yeah.

[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.000]
Every city, Milano's got the Duelm,

[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.980]
they got the Duelm, what do they call that Duelm Plaza?

[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:15.920]
Right, and you got the...

[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.020]
That's a lot of...

[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.160]
What hotel did you stay in the Excelsior?

[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.100]
Right.

[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:20.900]
And where we stayed?

[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:21.840]
That's a great hotel.

[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.200]
That's an outstanding hotel.

[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:23.920]
Unbelievable, unbelievable.

[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.640]
This was back in the late sixties.

[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:25.960]
Yeah.

[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.140]
When I was in the service.

[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.060]
And I realized when I was there that Cologne,

[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.860]
Cologne's roster, which is the Cologne you splash on,

[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.200]
that 4-7-11, which they advertise all over Europe.

[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.820]
That's the original Cologne.

[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:40.700]
You know, that's...

[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.020]
You buy it at 7-11?

[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.480]
4-7-11.

[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.660]
Where do you buy it at...

[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.120]
And more.

[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:45.720]
Right.

[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:46.400]
Yeah.

[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.500]
That's a beautiful city, Cologne.

[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.700]
Anybody that wants to go on guts and time to travel,

[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.700]
I would definitely allocate two days.

[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.600]
You've ever got to spend a couple of weeks in Europe,

[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.100]
two days in Cologne, please.

[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:56.500]
Yeah.

[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.540]
Great city.

[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.220]
Great people, very upscale, beautiful shopping.

[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:00.940]
Right.

[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.240]
I wanted to tell you about...

[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:03.900]
Great rock worst.

[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:05.500]
Yeah.

[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.020]
You were mentioning the difference between Berlin and West Germany.

[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.020]
How they saw the worst.

[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:09.780]
Right.

[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:15.420]
They used the Brochen in Berlin as a holder for the next 50 fending or whatever it is.

[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:15.640]
Right.

[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.660]
And they were very big on Currywurst.

[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:18.420]
Yeah.

[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.180]
They got that too.

[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.100]
And they would fry it.

[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.640]
I'm not too big on that Currywurst because every time I see the sign,

[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.760]
it makes me think of Kid Curry and I start getting like...

[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.900]
When I was in the service, I was stationed in Berlin.

[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.680]
And in order to get to, you could drive to West Germany from East Germany.

[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:32.060]
Yeah.

[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.520]
But they had something called the duty train,

[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.000]
which you would train?

[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.560]
The duty train?

[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:37.580]
Yes.

[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.140]
I think that was the one I was on.

[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:39.360]
Right.

[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:39.920]
Exactly.

[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.000]
That's why I thought of it.

[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.280]
But you talk about a terrible, miserable, horrible trip.

[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.940]
I mean, and we're talking about the guard coming on the train.

[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.420]
Talking about the train is now under the control of the police.

[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.740]
The guy, well, no, the guy from Netherlands, he says,

[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.920]
from this point on, the train was Emrich, not Mike Emrich,

[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.420]
but Emrich, Germany, is the...

[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.480]
Right, I guess, is the German and Netherlands border.

[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.760]
And he said, from this moment on, this train is in the hands of the German police.

[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.060]
Well, the thing is, what?

[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.220]
I just got real nervous.

[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.600]
Leaving West Berlin.

[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:13.740]
I can't believe it.

[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:14.240]
Yeah.

[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.200]
But leaving West Berlin going through East Germany, you have Popos,

[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.000]
which are the folks' polo thigh, from East Germany.

[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.860]
Leaving outside the train, the general left.

[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:24.640]
Come on to the right.

[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:24.860]
Yeah.

[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:25.600]
Come on to the train.

[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.180]
Let me tell you something.

[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:27.880]
It was quite a trip.

[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.740]
Just thought I'd share that with you.

[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:30.000]
Okay.

[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:30.700]
Have a good day.

[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.560]
I'll see you at...

[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:31.920]
And more.

[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:32.480]
You got it.

[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:32.720]
Okay.

[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.160]
Hey, let's give them a little bit of a plug.

[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.860]
Okay, I feel bad when people go out of business.

[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.360]
You know, they put all their hard work in that and everything else.

[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.840]
And then they buy spots on this station, trying to get a little business in there, trying to drum it up.

[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:44.680]
And then they go bust.

[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:45.720]
I feel bad about that.

[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.840]
I'm just an old sentimentalist.

[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.980]
Our poll question today is, by the way, which is what's the difference between star wars and star trade?

[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.120]
Rhymes with Drek.

[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.960]
I don't start putting on this act for me in areas like holding his stomach,

[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.980]
involving like I just said something blasphemous, like comparing Mexicans with...

[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:02.920]
...Port of Reacons?

[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.160]
Let's do a science fiction show, really.

[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:05.600]
What?

[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.740]
Get all these trekkies out of the woodwork on them?

[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.040]
No, I don't see the difference.

[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.440]
What's the difference between...

[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.840]
Like, you're sitting in there with Joe Costello this morning before the show,

[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.360]
and you're going through these magazines and...

[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.640]
Oh, please spare me the pain, okay?

[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:22.880]
I don't see the difference.

[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.620]
I know you don't.

[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.540]
Do you remember the date that you went one way and the world went the other?

[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.720]
Yeah, November 5th, 1942.

[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.320]
1026 to 560 WQM got him, I fast, huh?

[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.900]
Not always good, but really fast.

[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.040]
Regerepa canarabu di Obastado.

[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.300]
School, this Monday, come to the Pleasant's Ali Shopping Center,

[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.520]
and meet Bert Ward.

[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.560]
That's right, Robin from the hit 1966 television series, Batman.

[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.680]
She alive and in-person as he celebrates his birthday at the Pleasant's Ali Shopping Center.

[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.220]
Hi, I'm Bert Ward.

[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.740]
Join me on my birthday, July 6th. I'll be 47 years old.

[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.080]
Oh, God, I can't believe I'm still sweet.

[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:06.540]
Yes, the boy wonder will be there in full costumes, signing autographs,

[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.800]
posing for pictures and answering your questions about Batman.

[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.480]
Yeah, you and the third row.

[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.100]
Hey, man, where are you wearing no shoes?

[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.980]
They're not else shoes, they're booties.

[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.160]
The crime fighting booties.

[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.600]
Bert Ward will be talking about the years since his hit show, Batman,

[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.600]
and the impact it had on his life.

[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.980]
I don't know, nothing really went right after that, man.

[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.880]
I know Adam Weiss is doing that soft core porn at the cable,

[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.100]
but I'm in my mind in the shopping center opening.

[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.980]
Also keeps me in touch with my partner.

[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:37.160]
It's Robin, live and in-person on his 47th birthday at the Pleasant's Ali Shopping Center,

[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.360]
with over 17 great stores and outdoor convenience 12 hours a day.

[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.740]
I'm 47 years old and I'm wearing clothes.

[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:43.880]
Holy crap.

[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.940]
Okay, I'm just kidding, Josh.

[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.980]
I'm looking like better in the old days on TV.

[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.060]
Robin, Bert Ward, or what was his name on my three sons?

[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.400]
I want to look really, really good.

[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.080]
Even you would know.

[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.480]
Don't you remember my three sons with Fred McGorring?

[00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:57.780]

[00:22:58.460 --> 00:22:59.720]
Not Chip, definitely not Chip.

[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.180]
Ernie.

[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.560]
Not, definitely not Ernie.

[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.160]
Ernie was like the nerdy one with the glasses.

[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:03.800]
The other one.

[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.480]
What the hell was his name on my three sons?

[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.360]
Which they brought him back on the Geraltor or one of those shows?

[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.280]
Oh, God.

[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:10.960]
A few months ago.

[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.460]
Should never have to see these people want to get like old.

[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.740]
Oh, God.

[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.360]
Chip Ernie and Clefus.

[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:19.640]
Yeah, Clefus.

[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:19.840]
Right.

[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:20.300]
Cleetus.

[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.020]
Cleetus.

[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.160]
Here's a great fact by the way.

[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.260]
It's a Stracca did it all.

[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:24.700]
What a player.

[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.300]
Imagine line with Burry and Stracca.

[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.620]
I'll go eat even one better net because we could still have,

[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.980]
if it weren't for mistakes by the organization,

[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:35.400]
we could have Marty Stracca right there centering a line between Pavel Burry and Ray Whitney.

[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.560]
I like that, huh?

[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.640]
Just a prospect of that gives me goosebumps in my rectal.

[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:40.760]
Yeah, just thinking about that.

[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:41.560]
Was it Robbie?

[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.020]
Robbie, there you go.

[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.100]
Thank you, whoever called him.

[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:44.420]
Thank you.

[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:44.840]
That's enough.

[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.060]
All you faggot.

[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.580]
I mean, Robbie, what was his name?

[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.180]
Who played him?

[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:49.880]
Tom Grady.

[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:51.820]
Oh, man.

[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.200]
I have to think long and hard about that one.

[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.140]
Tom Grady or Bert War.

[00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:01.180]
Well, of course, Tom Grady never wore those tight green tights that Robyn did.

[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.940]
What do you think about two guys who live together like that?

[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:08.040]
You know, the older guy and the younger one who live in the slide up and down grease poles all the time.

[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.180]
I always wondered about Alfred, though.

[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.480]
I, you know, I wondered if Alfred used to like hide in the closet.

[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.120]
Maybe he had like a little people.

[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.280]
Here's the mobile and Cooper and glory city.

[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:18.580]
Hello.

[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.880]
Happy Fico de Mayo meal.

[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:21.560]
And back to you.

[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.520]
Batman, it was a gay show.

[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.520]
It was definitely.

[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.320]
Yeah, definitely.

[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.640]
I've got three famous nights to come for you.

[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:28.960]
All right.

[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.040]
Here we go, number one.

[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.140]
Number one, Carlos Santana.

[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:33.800]
Rockstar.

[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:35.500]
Yeah.

[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:36.900]
Number two.

[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:37.780]
Piber here that again.

[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.840]
If I ever hear Black Magic Woman one more time.

[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:40.560]
Oh, horrible.

[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:40.900]
Go ahead.

[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.180]
And number two, Santa Anna, the general who, who destroyed the Alamo.

[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.920]
Yeah, even the Mexicans had to have their own Santa, right?

[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.640]
And number three is Pancho V.

[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:51.020]
I don't know.

[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:51.760]
Pancho V, sure.

[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.680]
I don't know what he did, but he was a bandit.

[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.180]
Who's a bandit?

[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.180]
A bandita like most Mexicans.

[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:56.880]
He was a bandit.

[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:57.820]
He was a bandit.

[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.020]
He was a shameless request.

[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:00.500]
Okay.

[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.040]
The erection song.

[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.360]
Okay.

[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.380]
It's ahead of the rest.

[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.140]
See ya.

[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:04.620]
Thank you.

[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:05.320]
Oh.

[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.080]
What's so funny about that?

[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:07.680]
It's a tourism.

[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.640]
I mean some people will get upset about that.

[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.180]
Mexican bandita, isn't that redundant?

[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.120]
That's wrong with that.

[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.740]
It's like Puerto Rican with a switchblade.

[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.300]
I mean, it's why I repeat the obvious.

[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.000]
We're still waiting to hear from Puerto Ricans, by the way, as opposed to ones calling off the air.

[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:25.300]
Part of that little ass-grabbing club, which you see, you didn't know that you're a f***ing

[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.360]
grand-tongue-round with Puerto Ricans.

[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:27.900]
I'm telling something.

[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:31.900]
They're not as uptight and bigoted in the, you know, I'm telling you the condition, as you are.

[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.740]
56670560, pound 560 on the mobile one line.

[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.760]
Let's all go over to f***ing more and buy some sodas and some beer and have a big party.

[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:44.780]
Well, speaking of party, by the way, since we got that big Marlon game coming up, we haven't lunch from Chuck today.

[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:50.880]
I hope, like that salad you were talking about, that whatever the thing is with the meat and the cheese, that would be real good.

[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:52.780]
I'll get it.

[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:53.660]
W-Q-A-M.

[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.800]
Like I said, I would have gotten it.

[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.120]
Here's Miami.

[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:57.460]
Hello.

[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.660]
Parativa, parabajo, fidel, paus, cará.

[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.820]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that.

[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:04.340]
Go get a life.

[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:04.660]
Okay.

[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.360]
Get a search party out and go get a life.

[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.660]
Here's a mobile in Haya-Lia.

[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:08.940]
Hello.

[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:11.900]
Mobile in Haya-Lia.

[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:12.680]
Hello.

[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:13.280]
Yes, sir.

[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:13.900]
Somebody.

[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.720]
Hey, my girlfriend is a Puerto Rican.

[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:17.160]
Yeah.

[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.500]
And I know their favorite holiday.

[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.200]
Because of her family, it's called World Fair Friday.

[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:22.940]
Right.

[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:25.700]
Right.

[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:26.280]
Excellent.

[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.180]
And, but I'm going to get on with the more famous Mexican.

[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:30.740]
Yes, sir.

[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:32.460]
Taco Bellicio Howard.

[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:33.700]
Okay.

[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:34.500]
Quit while you're ahead.

[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:35.900]
Now, he does have a good point.

[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:41.620]
The Taco Bellicio Howard is a hell of a lot more, more famous than Pontuvia or Santa Ana.

[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:42.140]
Winds.

[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.200]
56670560, pound 560 on the mobile one line.

[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:47.560]
Cinco de Mayo.

[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.200]
Is there anybody in this town celebrating El Cinco de Mayo today?

[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:51.740]
There must be.

[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:52.940]
Was I read it in the paper yesterday?

[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.260]
They would never put anything on truth.

[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.740]
W-Q-A-M.

[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.200]
Yes.

[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:57.940]
Uh-huh.

[00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:58.960]
I know who that was.

[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.180]
Here's a lady in Pepper Pine.

[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:01.500]
Hello.

[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:02.900]
Hi, NL.

[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:03.600]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.920]
I'm going to change the subject.

[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.280]
I hope you don't get mad at me.

[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:07.700]
Well, anybody changed.

[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.060]
There is no subject on the show every day.

[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.120]
Maybe I should do with this claim or at the beginning of the show.

[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.400]
The subject is whatever.

[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.340]
Okay.

[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:19.060]
I need your help because it's Mother's Day coming up.

[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:19.280]
Yes.

[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.600]
And I'm a Mother of Three.

[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:26.040]
And I am looking for them to get me some kicked butt chocolates.

[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.200]
And I know you had mentioned a few times in the past.

[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.320]
There are Gina Batches from Meloranzos.

[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:33.960]
There are Gina, okay.

[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:34.480]
Okay.

[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:35.900]
What else?

[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.360]
What do you mean what else?

[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.580]
How much chocolate do you want to eat?

[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.000]
You want to let's go to the...

[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.360]
You know, you had mentioned a couple of brands.

[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.060]
There are one you can only get in Las Vegas, I think.

[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.000]
F-O-M.

[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:47.400]
What's it called?

[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.320]
F-O-M.

[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.280]
F-O-M.

[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:52.340]
It's not only in Las Vegas, but they have two big stores in Las Vegas.

[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.540]
One in the start-up casino.

[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:54.860]
Okay.

[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.540]
And one right next to the Imperial Palace.

[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:57.620]
F-O-M. Well, that's good.

[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.500]
In fact, they've got a butter crunch.

[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:00.860]
Do you know what I'm talking about?

[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:01.380]
Yes.

[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.200]
Oh, the F-O-M makes a butter crunch that I'm addicted to.

[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.880]
It's so good that I could just die from it.

[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.440]
I could just sit there and eat two or three pounds

[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.160]
and die with a big smile on my purse.

[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.000]
Uh-oh.

[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.300]
So where are they going to get that between now and Sunday?

[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.560]
Well, there's this company out called Federal Express.

[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.080]
Right.

[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.200]
And for the right price, you can get anything overnight, baby.

[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:19.800]
Federal Express.

[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.060]
I think I've heard of them, yeah.

[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.460]
And what about the Diabah?

[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.480]
You're not a big diabah here?

[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.360]
The Diabah is okay.

[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.000]
I mean, it's highly overpriced.

[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.940]
Although, ethylems are expensive too, but the Diabah can get anywhere, you know?

[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.880]
Okay, but ethylems worth the price.

[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:34.780]
Ethylems really good.

[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.420]
If you like those butter crunch, trust me.

[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:36.980]
You'll love those.

[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.020]
Thank you.

[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:38.660]
I'll bring your flowers.

[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.580]
I'll put some flowers on your tombstone.

[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:41.480]
Oh, my God.

[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.140]
Sounds great.

[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:42.760]
But what a way to go.

[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:43.560]
Okay, have a happy one.

[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:43.840]
I'll be right back.

[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.060]
Okay, ethylems.

[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.360]
Anybody know where we get some ethylems out of them in Las Vegas?

[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.460]
Oh, that's good candy.

[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.740]
That's our poor person today, by the way, who makes the best candy?

[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.580]
I do like a diabah.

[00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:58.340]
Huh?

[00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.960]
But it is overpriced.

[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.720]
You find a good diabah like in real, real upscale shopping malls, you know?

[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.340]
I mean, real artsy, fartsy.

[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.880]
Like in the Eaton Center in Toronto, they got a good diabah chocolate.

[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.780]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on a mobile online.

[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.180]
Boy, these people are really boring, you know?

[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.340]
I mean, they're dead heads.

[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.340]
Just about as much fun as going to...

[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:25.300]
...and more and paying too much for soda and beer and wine, stuff like that.

[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.580]
They do have stuff to drink over there, by the way.

[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.880]
22 before 11 at 5.

[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.300]
Well, I just saw that ad.

[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.560]
Somebody pointed the ad out to me and I feel bad, okay?

[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.400]
Because I know that they spent a lot of money on this station.

[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.800]
We are very, some of us are very conscientious.

[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.240]
We want to do a good job with responses.

[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.780]
And when you see somebody going out of business, even though they were to sponsor a mine,

[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.120]
I never did any endorsements for them.

[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.120]
Better late than ever.

[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.500]
Maybe I can, you know, maybe I can salvage them or something.

[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.660]
Maybe we can get a big run on that place called...

[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.020]
...and more.

[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.460]
Hey, here's a place you ought to be running to and that's...

[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.460]
May 5th.

[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.780]
Think I'll do my...

[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.560]
Long Mexican National holiday.

[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.880]
Home stations are giving away trips to cancels.

[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.820]
Some are giving away trips to Mexico City.

[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.900]
But who are we offering in Mexico to use?

[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:05.580]
That's right.

[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.620]
We are giving away Mexicans.

[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.440]
Real live Mexicans.

[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:10.420]
I...

[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:11.200]
...guramba.

[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.760]
We'll be smuggling illegal aliens across the border in the real world of the station van.

[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.340]
Then we'll give one to you.

[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.560]
Him mansion or own.

[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.820]
Personal Mexicans.

[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.960]
They'll wash your car.

[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:21.820]
In your house.

[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:22.760]
In your car.

[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.060]
Anything to want.

[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.360]
Because if they don't, you'll have them deported.

[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.140]
Audio's ambiguous.

[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.380]
Leave a head color when you hear this song.

[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.460]
And win a Mexican.

[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.920]
Members of this station and their families are not eligible to own Mexicans.

[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.800]
Fading in delos into Mexicans, his winner's responsibility.

[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.840]
Station assumes no liability for infectious diseases carried by Mexicans.

[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.000]
Now the break. Think of your myo with your own home.

[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.060]
Every day with your very own Mexican.

[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.280]
People will think of me.

[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.160]
Okay, 1043 in an honor of El Sincu de Mayo Day, we ought to be ordering a Mexican tradition.

[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.040]
Mexican cuisine like Taco Bell.

[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.920]
Which Taco Bell has got nothing to do with Mexico.

[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.800]
What is Mexican cuisine?

[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.080]
I mean burritos are Mexican.

[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:01.000]
Right?

[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:02.020]
Tacos.

[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:03.260]
Oh, they are.

[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.360]
It's not the same type of thing.

[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.340]
Oh, what do you mean by that?

[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.020]
I mean, it's very refined.

[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:12.320]
How about all these Mexican restaurants like Carlos and Pepe's and all of those closer to it?

[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.520]
Huh? Is that like the real thing?

[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:19.500]
Is that the emissaries that like Americanized bastardized like they do in this country with virtually every kind of ethnic food that they come up with?

[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.100]
Like Italian?

[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:20.960]
Yes, that.

[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.900]
Well, what passes for Italian food in this country?

[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.880]
So, I'm talking to you in Rome, they would laugh.

[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.140]
They would laugh most of these people right off the street.

[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.360]
They would laugh them right out of business, even at f***ing and more.

[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.200]
WQAN.

[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.340]
Yeah, I was on hold. I got cut off.

[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.080]
Okay, hang on.

[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.980]
Uh, wait, where you call from?

[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:43.540]
Hey, Neil.

[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:43.940]
Yeah.

[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:50.520]
You know, that's what I am when you go out there and you run out of money.

[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.820]
You think it's typical Florida guy? I got that free candy.

[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.260]
Right, that's like in Hershey, Pennsylvania to give you a tour.

[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.820]
But of course, that's the marginal chocolate compared to the FLM.

[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:58.540]
Yeah, that's great.

[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:02.600]
Have you ever had the buttered whatever I was just talking about?

[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.940]
No, I just, I don't remember. I might have had it.

[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:06.600]
Oh, man.

[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.000]
But they got some great stuff like that.

[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:08.600]
What are you saying?

[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.780]
And they got a wholesale store. You can just buy this stuff right there.

[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:12.740]
A wholesale store?

[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.840]
Yeah, right there in the plant, in the factory.

[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.020]
Are you serious? Now, how far out of town is it?

[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.820]
I'm sorry about the 20 minutes, 25 minutes.

[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.700]
They have tours, just regular tours.

[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:22.060]

[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.420]
The next time I'm in Vegas, I'm going to go there.

[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.120]
Okay, hey, I got a half out of famous Mexican, Mago Labor.

[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.100]
Okay, thanks.

[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.040]
Okay, like I said, quote, while you were ahead,

[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.820]
there's got to be famous Mexicans. I mean, they're in a country with that many

[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.040]
millions of people teaming, starving.

[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.540]
I would have always liked to visit Mexico, but I keep hearing all these.

[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.280]
I guess it's too late. Maybe once upon a time, it was safe to go there.

[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.820]
But everybody tells me I keep reading these horrible things about people that go there.

[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.760]
And they go to the airport, they get in a cab, and nobody ever sees them again.

[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.660]
We seem to be very commonplace.

[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.180]
And also that's happening in Brazil a lot too, like in Rio.

[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.620]
Huh? In those 10th world countries, I keep trying to tell you,

[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.600]
South of the Texas border, not the Texas or Oklahoma, so great.

[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.380]
Don't pick on them, or those tornadoes going on.

[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.440]
But that's so great. But once you get south of that U.S. border, man,

[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.240]
woo, 80th world countries.

[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.920]
Just take a look at Santa Promotion Man from Venezuela.

[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.700]
Just take a look at his face. That should tell you everything you need to know.

[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:19.860]
Across between the late Andrew Cunanan and Keanu Reeves on a bad day.

[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.560]
That's Santa Promotion Man.

[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.420]
Well, by the way, when you're going to bring me that Enrique a record,

[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.140]
see, he comes in here the other day.

[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.600]
He just, his timing is so piss poor, you know.

[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.320]
He comes in here the other day Monday, I guess.

[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.900]
I'm just back from vacation. I'm trying to get my mind into whatever I'm doing here.

[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.940]
And he's like, how can he be a Chinook with Enrique? He's got a song out in English,

[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.240]
but I'd be back, do I want it? Now I want it.

[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.240]
That's our poll question. You write it here Enrique or...

[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:45.100]
Huh?

[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.160]
For the new batch, Nicole.

[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.400]
Well, I'm telling you this song all the way to work all the way home.

[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.620]
Over and over. I just keep goosebumps.

[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.720]
It's going to be number one. I'm telling you right now.

[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.040]
It's already number two in Denmark. I just thought I would mention that.

[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.720]
Because if you care, here's a mobile in Jupiter. Hello?

[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:03.020]
Neil.

[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:03.500]
Yes, sir.

[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.140]
Uh, uh, a famous Mexican.

[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:09.920]
I can't remember his name exactly, but that's that picture for the Dodgers.

[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.780]
Guerrero or whatever it was.

[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:13.100]
Guerrero?

[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.520]
I don't know. He was a...

[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.260]
He was doing really well.

[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.520]
You're talking about the big fan-ass of pitch of the Dodgers in the volcano.

[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.060]
His name is escaped by mine. I can see him, but I can't think of his name right now.

[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.840]
He's not amazing. He tried to come back about 40 times. What's that?

[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:26.420]
His name.

[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:27.980]
Guerrero or Roberto Guerrero?

[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.840]
No, not Guerrero. His name wasn't Guerrero.

[00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.800]
There's Pedro Guerrero, but he's not a pitcher.

[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.920]
Hey, you know, the Fernando Balonzuela.

[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:35.360]
That's it.

[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:35.620]
That's it.

[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:36.740]
That's how much you were on.

[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.760]
Hey, you're saying Mexican banditos.

[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:45.380]
I can prove it. If you've ever seen a Mexican driver's car, they got that little tiny steering wheel.

[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.340]
I thought they could drive with a handcuff gun.

[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.260]
All right. Thank you, sir. God bless you.

[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:54.520]
And we're celebrating El Sico de Mayo today by making a great tribute to all the great Mexicans.

[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.880]
I think we're probably finished with a list.

[00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:57.840]
Well, we still...

[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.520]
We said, if we had won a famous Puerto Rican yet today.

[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:00.800]
No.

[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:01.100]
No.

[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.040]
Who's not behind bars?

[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:03.320]
No.

[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:08.280]
Come on. I mean, if we're going to have the 50th per state, let's at least find out who the famous people are.

[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.180]
Like all those famous people from Alaska, who live at them in.

[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.860]
We just like the last game because we were worried about the pipeline up there.

[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.660]
And we want to tell those Ruskies, you better stay on your side of the border.

[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.200]
And then, of course, with Hawaii, we want to take care of Jack Lord.

[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.920]
He is dead, right? He's officially dead.

[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.480]
Jack Lord, and also, it didn't Raymond Burd die out there, too?

[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:35.600]
Just like Netherlands, maybe they'll have their own Queens day someday.

[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.200]
You know about Raymond Burd, of course.

[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.780]
Here's the Boka. Hello. Boka.

[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:43.460]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:43.780]
Great.

[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.680]
Hey, I've got a couple for you.

[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:48.360]
The famous Puerto Rican, Chi Chi Rodriguez.

[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.820]
Chi Chi Rodriguez, the golfer is Puerto Rican?

[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:52.640]
That's correct.

[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:58.700]
And you got Benny Castilla from Mexico, and you got a Lich Vino from Mexico.

[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.620]
Lich Vino from Mexico. All the golfer are from Mexico.

[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:02.940]
Yeah.

[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:04.040]
They're okay. Thank you.

[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.640]
So they know their balls in Mexico, I guess.

[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.080]
Golfers. By the way, is there anybody out there who considers golfer sport?

[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:09.400]
No.

[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.280]
I heard I know that CNN has gotten not CNN.

[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:14.640]
ESPN has got this thing out with the greatest 50,000 athletes of all time.

[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.220]
And somebody called Hank yesterday about, you know, Moreno should have been higher.

[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.080]
He was like 72 or 74 and Mickey Mantle was 37.

[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.080]
And then we're talking about Bobby Jones.

[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.580]
The Bobby Jones was a golfer.

[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:30.540]
Golf is not a sport. I mean, if you want to go out and play it, it's like a recreation.

[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.700]
But anybody that says a golfer is an athlete?

[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:38.620]
Anybody that would say that, that would have to be audacity to make that come and need psychiatric help.

[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.640]
I mean, let's get serious. Jack Nicholas, an athlete?

[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:46.300]
He's just like an overgrown child that never grew up in transcended golf, like Arnold Palmer.

[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:51.180]
They discovered they could make a lot of money doing it, and they just never found a real life.

[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.820]
But a guy that spends his whole life playing golf?

[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.840]
That's an athlete? No. No chance.

[00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:02.180]
And the fact that those people would be on the list along with great athletes like Martin Straca.

[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:07.000]
They'd go out there and risk their life and limb every night of the year, like last night.

[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.620]
Nice going penguins, by the way.

[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.480]
That's going to be a great series. We're finally going to see some goal scored.

[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:16.620]
And they police in the Pittsburgh Penguins starting Friday night at the Air Canada Center in Toronto.

[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.300]
If I had any brains, I'd get there a lot of here Friday.

[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.340]
I'd get on a plane, I'd go up there and see.

[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.480]
I'd get some good free tickets for those playoff games.

[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:29.980]
I'd talk to my good friend Don Cherry or Ron McLean or Harry Neal or Joe Bowen, somebody on the inside.

[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:32.460]
I wouldn't waste my time getting bad tickets from you, no, who?

[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.980]
Who, by the way, says that he hates you like poison now.

[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:39.220]
And I want to start anything, you know, up, but hates you like poison.

[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.560]
Yeah. He says you couldn't do a talk show if they stuck a revolver up your neck.

[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.360]
He says those shows you the last week.

[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.660]
They stuck. That's what he said.

[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.940]
Hey, he could fill in guest host. No, we could not. Not on issue. We couldn't. Not for two seconds.

[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:58.320]
Oh, well, I've got next time I go on vacation. Why did you have mine for a hockey show?

[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.040]
WDQAM.

[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.100]
Yeah, one of the talk to Neal speaking.

[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:06.660]
Hi, now I got a couple of Mexicans that are famous for you.

[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:06.940]
Yes.

[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:08.540]
Cheech and Chong.

[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:11.020]
Paul Rodriguez.

[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:15.520]
Tommy Chong is not a Mexican. What is he?

[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:17.400]
Tommy Chong.

[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:18.500]
Oh, no, no.

[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.680]
Paul Rodriguez.

[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:20.960]
Yes. Paul Rodriguez.

[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:21.580]
The comedian.

[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.640]
And I think Peter were well as well.

[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:25.760]
Okay.

[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.760]
Peter were well as a Mexican.

[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:29.660]
All right.

[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.680]
Hey, if Sandy Davis and Rod Caru could be Jewish, why can't Peter were LB a Mexican Canadian?

[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.100]
There's another hyphenated deal for you.

[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.500]
We keep her in all these like yesterday. All these Americans calling in.

[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.260]
I don't want to hear about any more hyphenated.

[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:43.860]
I don't want to hear about African Americans.

[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.540]
I don't want to hear about Italian American.

[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:46.680]
Polish Americans.

[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.040]
In Americans.

[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.440]
I don't want to hear no more of that crap.

[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:49.840]
Okay.

[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.300]
If you're that much of a lemon, if you're that much of a non individualist,

[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:58.400]
if you have no self identity that you have to be a part of some kind of a goddamn club,

[00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.540]
then I don't want to talk to you.

[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.280]
I want to hear about you.

[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.140]
I hate that crap.

[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.180]
That's the biggest problem in the world.

[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.820]
If you took all, I know it sounds, and it's never going to happen.

[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.520]
But if you took all these labels off everybody, religious labels, ethnic labels,

[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.040]
then nobody would know who to kill.

[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.820]
Unless, of course, you took their parking spot.

[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.080]
Because they don't ask any questions about that once you take your parking.

[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.880]
Well, did I mention, by the way, I only saw three dark people in Cologne, Germany.

[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:22.620]
I mentioned that yesterday.

[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.260]
I know I did.

[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:25.520]
That's one a day.

[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:26.820]
I was there. We were there for three days.

[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.240]
I saw three sparsers in Cologne.

[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:28.900]
That's one a day.

[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:29.420]
It's like vitamins.

[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.720]
I can handle that.

[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.020]
More than that, I get nervous.

[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.140]
I'm just being honest with you.

[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.560]
Like here, I come in here.

[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.660]
Once in a great while, we see...

[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.180]
There's the gacking on the floor.

[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:42.580]
Right.

[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:43.520]
Once in a great...

[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:45.060]
I haven't seen Roy in a coonsate.

[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:47.180]
Anybody else?

[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:47.920]
Do we have any other guy?

[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.100]
And we see what's his name?

[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:49.820]
Lenny Martez.

[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.900]
But he's also Puerto Rican, by the way.

[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:55.200]
He's Puerto Rican, and he's a Puerto Rican scharcher.

[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:58.000]
I didn't know there was such a thing.

[00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:58.660]

[00:39:59.360 --> 00:39:59.720]
...scharters.

[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:04.340]

[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.040]

[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.040]
Ah, there you go.

[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:13.580]

[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:30.660]
Sorry game.

If we paid you $500 in any, would you listen to the game?

[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.400]
Absolutely not.

[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:34.740]

[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:35.100]

And then the most recent famous Mexican opening Dave Benny Castillo.

[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:54.740]
Yeah, somebody mentioned that.

[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:55.460]
Oh, did they like?

[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:55.780]

[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:48.880]
Yes.

[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:55.000]
They said that Jews think all of themselves Jews all the time.

[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.480]
They guys let you do, but I can't say that.

[00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:58.720]
Why not?

[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:00.140]

Well, they can say that.

[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.620]
They say that's not allowed.

[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:03.860]
Are you sure you can't say that's not allowed?

[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.780]
How about those old Jews up in Sunrise in Tamarack?

[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:10.200]
You can say crazy old Jews.

[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:10.760]
You can say that.

[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.960]
Yeah, I can say that, but I can't call it a girlfriend.

[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:14.120]

[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:17.680]
Sure you can't.

[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.620]
I hope you dump that bitch.

[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:20.800]
She's gone a long time.

[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:20.900]
Good.

[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.100]
But also the thing is, blacks are talking in the store, man.

[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.720]
They're all calling it, like, I dig her, niggered.

[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.840]
Oh, then I don't realize that.

[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.980]
I'll fill my last trip to Amsterdam.

[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:33.280]
I never realized how frequently dark-completed people call each other niggered.

[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.540]
I think I said to nigger, well, not like what they do with the call nations.

[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:38.380]
Because that's the lower end of the television.

[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:38.760]
What's that?

[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.400]
But also when I, they did that, I go, hey, look, these are guys I know.

[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:46.080]
I self-disassured, I go, listen guys, can you please not use that word?

[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:46.980]
You know what bothers you?

[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.460]
They look at me and they go, and they laugh.

[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:51.980]
Okay.

[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:53.620]

[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:54.500]
Wow.

Now what do we call it, Jamaicans?

[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.520]
Our friends.

[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:01.780]
Huh?

[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:02.580]
Our friends.

[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.360]
Yeah, I'm not.

[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:04.180]
I think I have the good stuff.

[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.140]
5.670, 05.60, 05.60.

[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.560]
And of course they're beginning to let the jerk pork and jerk, uh, yeah.

[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.420]
They're jerking it.

[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.920]
Four minutes before 11 at 5.50 WQM, there's only...

[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.240]
No, what you do is you get your fire.

[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:19.540]
You get the fire.

[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.980]
You get daddy's daddy's daddy's daddy.

[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.460]

[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.820]
And yet...

[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.420]
This thing's on the wall.

[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.760]
Daddy, you're a loser.

[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.060]

[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:02.260]
Highs man man on these years.

[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:09.480]
Daddy, why don't you get a job?

[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.640]
Daddy, you smell like deer.

[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.660]
I'm dropping out of high school.

[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:34.740]
Daddy, I'm pregnant.

[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.400]
I don't know who the father is.

[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:47.440]
I asked the turn chick, how you have?

[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:53.060]
I drove the car into a tree.

[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:56.740]

[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.120]
Dad, I asked the news.

[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:43.700]

[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.100]
and actually win a ball game.

[00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:58.420]
Any chance they're going to...

[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.640]
Are they going to have more than 5,000 you think today?

[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:00.960]
No.

[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.960]
That's coming up 1230 with a pregame,

[00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:03.600]
1 o'clock to the game,

[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.940]
Hankel be on after the game,

[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:05.400]
which...

[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.780]
I said, you know nobody in the world,

[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:08.160]
envy you.

[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.000]
Oh, God.

[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.260]
Following a Marlin game.

[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.500]
And then what we got to rest today,

[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:14.500]
we must have something going on,

[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.100]
6 o'clock after Hankel and 4 to 6,

[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:16.700]
we got...

[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:16.880]
Yeah!

[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:18.560]
...Gamandits, here you go, the mad dog,

[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.100]
and Kaplan, 10 o'clock tonight.

[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:21.000]
And I got...

[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.380]
How come the guy called me?

[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.800]
To complain that Ed gave him a bad horse in the Derby.

[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.980]
Why don't you show us a ball, sir?

[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:28.980]
The guy that called here yesterday

[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:31.360]
and said, Ed Kaplan was the son of a bitch and every...

[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.600]
Every other thing out of the sun.

[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.880]
Call him up and tell him that.

[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:37.980]
Here's plantation.

[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:38.440]
Hello.

[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:39.400]
Dale.

[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:39.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.720]
Dale just mothered that if she really wants the best chocolate

[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:44.660]
in the whole white world,

[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.340]
from the home of the Rangers

[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.820]
and the islanders,

[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:49.600]
there's a little place called Tosher

[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.740]
on the Rock of Felicenter.

[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:51.440]
It's for you.

[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:51.940]
What is it?

[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:52.540]
Tosher.

[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.860]
T-A-U-S-C-A-G-R.

[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:56.800]
They'll ship it to the press to you,

[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.620]
so champagne samples are absolutely to die for.

[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:00.580]
Huh. Do you have the number?

[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:01.540]
Oh, boy.

[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:02.660]
No, I've ordered from there,

[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.840]
but it's Tosher at the Rock of Felicenter and I'm happy.

[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:05.980]
Okay, we'll get a thank you, sir.

[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:06.760]
Oh, and by the way,

[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.800]
yes, they're the Mexican.

[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:08.740]
What's the domingo?

[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:09.920]
Placido domingo.

[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:11.960]
C1 sábado.

[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:12.800]
Absolutely.

[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:13.300]
Okay.

[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.220]
Here's the atol free number for Ethel M, by the way.

[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.700]
C.U. Aksin that we got it.

[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.320]
And thanks to whoever called it in.

[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:23.000]
1-800-438-4356.

[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.980]
I can't believe that we have people in this audience who never had Ethel M.

[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:32.020]
You had Ethel M, right?

[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.260]
Remember when we stayed at the Imperial Palace?

[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:36.040]
Some of those great Bob Lincoln trips.

[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:37.180]
Octavigus.

[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:42.540]
Right next door to Imperial Palace is a big Ethel M and then better than that inside the start-up.

[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.940]
Very, very expensive.

[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:44.440]
Thank you.

[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:44.740]
You know something.

[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.760]
Thank God it's that expensive because a lot of people would be a push-up daisies.

[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.640]
Because he too much of that little Killa, but God is that good.

[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.900]
They had them there in the gift shop at the Imperial Palace.

[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:53.280]
They do?

[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.380]
The Nazi Palace, yes.

[00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.760]
Are you going to start that stuff again?

[00:48:58.940 --> 00:48:59.240]
I hate those people.

[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:00.200]
Just because they're why.

[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:01.180]
What do they do to you?

[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:07.120]
The crowd wouldn't let me sit and eat at a little table right outside our party room when no one could find a seat inside the party.

[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.900]
Maybe you find out you were f***ing them.

[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:09.260]
Yeah.

[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.460]
W-Q-A-M.

[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:13.640]
Yes, good morning.

[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:15.520]
Crowds don't like f***ing too much.

[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:15.920]
Yes, sir.

[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:19.460]
Yeah, E-L-I want to wish a happy half-first day.

[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.000]
Half-first day?

[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000]
Yeah, November 5th.

[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.440]
This is May 5th.

[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:24.460]
It's six months in.

[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.340]
Oh, no, I don't count by the half-year.

[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:27.580]
I don't, not at this stage.

[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.920]
Well, I only recently got to look in fact.

[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:30.420]
I'm not ahead.

[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:31.440]
Well, okay.

[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:35.620]
Well, thinking ahead, my birthday today and I was wondering if I could get a little mentally.

[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:37.060]
A mentally?

[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.120]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.000]
Your little f***ing.

[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:40.320]
You mean that?

[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:41.160]
Yes, that's right.

[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:41.800]
How about a little mentally?

[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:43.320]
Whether without Bobby Hadfield.

[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:44.260]
We'll pack him a sandwich.

[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:46.120]
The righteous Brothers.

[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.280]
If I ever hear them again, it'll be much too soon.

[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.620]
Well, now you're dating me just as well as you.

[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.360]
Well, I'm spending my 48th birthday at work.

[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:57.260]
I'm looking forward to going and getting off work and having a good time.

[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.860]
I didn't want to tell you that you've...

[00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:00.500]
Well, that one's you're not going to the mall and game, right?

[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.260]
No, I'm going to miss it.

[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:02.800]
Okay.

[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.000]
I just didn't want to go to a sauna instead.

[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:07.340]
All right, well, thanks a lot, Neil.

[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.260]
Okay, have a happy, sir.

[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.020]
Take care.

[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:09.680]
God bless you.

[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:10.520]
It's 48 today.

[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:11.960]
It's spring chicken and this town.

[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.780]
Got the next half of this lot to look forward to.

[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.060]
Well, it's bad eating on here.

[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.120]
By the way, thanks for a good friend.

[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:17.440]
Chocolate.

[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:18.380]
Oh, geez.

[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.420]
You see that?

[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:24.420]
I just dropped a little piece of meat right out of my mouth, right out of my watch, right

[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:26.940]
out of my real nice, saco-kinetic watch.

[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.400]
These are the best, by the way.

[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.280]
Saco de Mayo.

[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.700]
Saco de Mayo, an honor of the Mexicans.

[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.540]
It's a Mexican watch.

[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:36.720]
Which means you better hang out of a real tight because you won't have it once you leave the

[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:36.920]
border.

[00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:40.360]
It's a saco-titanium.

[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:41.540]
Well, these are the best.

[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:42.080]
These are great.

[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:43.780]
Which, though, you don't have to monkey around with a battery.

[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:45.980]
And, of course, it is.

[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.360]
It recharges itself by the motion of the left wrist.

[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.460]
So it gets a lot of use.

[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:55.440]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60, not necessarily on myself.

[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.200]
And pound 5, 60 on the 18T wireless line.

[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:00.180]
Here's the Miami.

[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:00.460]
Hello.

[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:01.800]
Hey, Neil.

[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:02.380]
How are you?

[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:02.540]
Great.

[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:03.500]
Okay.

[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:05.160]
Couple of things for you to fall.

[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.700]
I'm one of a few people I'm sitting here in the parking lot.

[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:10.900]
Get ready to go into the baseball game.

[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:12.640]
I figured it beats work.

[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:13.840]
Oh, my God.

[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:14.180]
Wow.

[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:15.600]
Congratulations.

[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.280]
Congratulations, sir.

[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.720]
One good thing you'll have that you'll have a lot of elbow room.

[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.060]
Like they said, you went up in Fort Lauderdale on the beach.

[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.900]
Lots of elbow room at the P.P. Park.

[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:24.820]
Right.

[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:26.160]
Plenty of chances to get elbow.

[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:31.780]
But anyway, famous Mexicans, how about the phrase, genuine, corinthian leather?

[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.000]
Ricardo Montelman?

[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.100]
Ricardo Montelman.

[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:38.580]
You know, I just read a thing about him about how he's doing another ad campaign for something

[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:39.260]
on ESPN.

[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.520]
I remember actually seeing him a video somewhere.

[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.900]
I can't remember where maybe it was in school or something a long time ago about Mexico.

[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.600]
And they had the famous Mexicans.

[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:52.540]
And he was one of like the two or three people.

[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.060]
How about Fernando Lomas?

[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:54.920]
Is he a Mexican?

[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.060]
I don't know.

[00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:58.380]
But what about the box or Julio says our chavez?

[00:51:58.920 --> 00:51:58.920]

[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.000]
He's at the east.

[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:07.500]
I think he's like, I think he's like, I mean, if Fernando Lomas and the Lorenzo Lomas who used to look really pretty name good, by the way, up until about an hour ago.

[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:11.220]
And by the way, my favorite candy.

[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:12.580]
What was that thought that he was on?

[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:13.900]
Was that the dynasty?

[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.000]
Not the one with Barbara Stanwirk, Calcincrest.

[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:18.500]
Falcon crest with Lorenzo Lomas.

[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:19.700]
Right, right.

[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:22.100]
Then it was the movie he was in where he was wrestling that big snake.

[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.540]
I think he used to get me excited.

[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:24.720]
But anyway.

[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:35.760]
My favorite candy though is, I don't know, different brands, but the chocolate covered pretzels or something about that combination of chocolate and salt.

[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:37.600]
Chocolate covered pretzels.

[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.280]
With chocolate and salt.

[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.380]
I have one word for that.

[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:40.720]
Fae.

[00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:43.360]
Okay, have a great day, sir.

[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.040]
All right, man.

[00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:45.400]
Okay, whatever you say.

[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:48.460]
Fernando Lomas, Ricardo Montobon.

[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:49.900]
Now we're starting to get the list.

[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:50.560]
Wasn't that hard?

[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:50.960]
Wasn't it?

[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.880]
There's got to be at least eight or nine famous Mexicans.

[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:54.640]
That's not too bad.

[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.680]
Well, we'll rest them more probably behind bars.

[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.860]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.540]
Forced all radio is dead.

[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:10.520]
So starting this Monday, 560 WQAM is proud to present the Joker.

[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:27.060]
So Monday through Friday, 6 to 10 AM only on 560 WQAM.

[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:32.140]
Here's with Juan Montobon and the Chrysler New Yorker.

[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:38.800]
This luxurious automobile has always delivered the performance you'd expect from a New Yorker.

[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:48.200]
And now Chrysler introduces an onboard microprocessor which even speaks to you just like a New Yorker.

[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.040]
Hey, more Ron, you want to put on your seatbelt?

[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:52.800]
Would you rather eat the steering wheel, huh?

[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.020]
Ah, yes.

[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.800]
This is truly a New Yorker.

[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.540]
All right, genius, you let the CUPAM headlights on.

[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.480]
Jeez, you want dumbass?

[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:03.520]
Oh, you know that.

[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:08.860]
And for the most dangerous city in the world, a security system second to none.

[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.040]
Hey, bag of brains, you want to lock the fucking doors?

[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.640]
Or maybe you put a fucking sign in the window and says, rip me along.

[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:17.960]
Yes, the Chrysler New Yorker.

[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.440]
If you can find a better luxury car, buy it.

[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:24.940]
Buy it, if you're a luxury man.

[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:29.120]
1, 15 and 5, 50 WQAM speaking of great candy, by the way, how about farmers' fanning?

[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:30.940]
Or is it Fanny's farmer?

[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:32.060]
Brackdom, something like that.

[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:36.220]
I haven't had Fanny's farmer in solo farmer's spanny in so long.

[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.560]
Have you ever had it?

[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:39.080]
Never heard of it?

[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:40.060]
North East.

[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.800]
I think they originally from Rochester, all over the Heaven in Boston,

[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:43.940]
California, North East.

[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.980]
Fanny's, uh, I know I can't even figure out how you really say it, right?

[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:48.720]
Fanny's Fanny.

[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:50.760]
Here's a mobile and sunrise.

[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:51.100]
Hello.

[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:53.060]
Hello, Neil.

[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:53.600]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:57.860]
You know, I think people are forgetting the most famous Mexican of them all.

[00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:58.340]
Yes.

[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:03.340]
Yolkato Taco Bell, the little dog, the stupid little dog.

[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:05.620]
And then the farmer's coming there ready to beat you to it, sir.

[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.560]
But to God bless you, the guy hung up.

[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.980]
What he was going to say that the llamas are from Peru.

[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:13.840]
Well, that's where you find llamas in Peru, right?

[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.080]
Makes sense to me.

[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:18.500]
Lorenzo llamas is Peruvian.

[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:19.800]
Oh, I'm heading for Peru right away.

[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.320]
What time does it explain to Lima?

[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:23.200]
How's Tony Lima doing, by the way?

[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:26.120]
Speaking of golfers, we see also a probably.

[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.480]
And he was Peruvian.

[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:30.460]
Who the hell, see what I'm saying?

[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.340]
I'm glad we got into this conversation today because it proves my point.

[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:36.980]
Who cares what anybody, all this ethnic crap nobody should care.

[00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:38.960]
Oh, he wasn't Mexican.

[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:40.060]
He was born in Puerto Rico.

[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:41.100]
Therefore he is Puerto Rican.

[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:42.020]
Yeah, and.

[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:46.180]
In fact, you know, that's, that is an excellent question.

[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:47.740]
What would you rather be?

[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:49.980]
Would you rather be Mexican or Puerto Rican?

[00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:52.100]
Huh?

[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.320]
That's an excellent question.

[00:55:54.320 --> 00:56:03.560]
I know that's for some people, like Jordan's give me a look, like that that like choice between death by electrocution or by a firing squad, you know.

[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:07.220]
Mexican or Puerto Rican, something that really think long and hard about.

[00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:09.300]
Here's Miami.

[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:09.600]
Hello.

[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:11.920]
Good afternoon, Neil.

[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:12.400]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:12.660]
Good evening.

[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:13.060]
Good morning.

[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:13.960]
Whatever it is.

[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:16.300]
Number one, a gringo de mayo.

[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:17.440]
Birthday boy today.

[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.560]
Another birthday boy, huh?

[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.500]
Yeah, can you believe a gringo on that?

[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.740]
A gringo on a stinker of mayo.

[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:27.380]
Please sign you on the waveo or follow us, not be died.

[00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:28.560]
The police, your birthday.

[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:30.040]
The police on your birthday.

[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:34.940]
The most famous Mexican is the guy who invented the low rider.

[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:40.560]
They can, now they can drive and pick heads and letters at the same time.

[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:41.160]
All right.

[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:42.800]
Have a happy, sir.

[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:43.380]
God bless you.

[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:43.780]
There you go.

[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:44.180]
Beautiful.

[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.640]
I guess you don't want to be Puerto Rican, huh?

[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:51.840]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 5, 60, on the 18th D wireless line.

[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:57.520]
See, you started that thing with the stereotypes about talking about Niranjya and Homestead and the

[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:58.100]
stereo city.

[00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.400]
I know the area as well.

[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:00.320]
Meaning what?

[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:03.720]
I grew up down there in the Redlands and Leisure City in the Leibor City.

[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:03.720]

[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:03.820]
With what?

[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:04.400]
With Mexican?

[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:05.960]
They have the Mexican labor camps.

[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:07.200]
How could you explain that?

[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:07.520]
I'll tell.

[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:10.480]
WQAM.

[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:12.140]
Hello.

[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:12.740]
Yes, sir.

[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.520]
Hey, uh, it's fucking you.

[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:15.000]
Speaking.

[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:16.280]
Hey, Neil.

[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:17.780]
Hey, I got to be Puerto Rican.

[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:19.520]
Yeah.

[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:20.760]
Yeah, really?

[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:23.920]
For one thing when you're born, you got that a US passport in your hand, buddy.

[00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:24.360]
Right.

[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:24.800]
Good point.

[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:25.380]
Always work.

[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.380]
Hey, uh, things like that again.

[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:28.680]
Things like that again.

[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:30.020]
Who?

[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:31.220]
Talia.

[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:32.840]
Yeah, singer.

[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:33.920]
Okay.

[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:34.300]
Thank you.

[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.560]
What do you say, you said?

[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:36.540]
Yeah.

[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:37.440]
I don't know who that is.

[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.220]
How about Cheyenne?

[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:38.860]
Cheyenne?

[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:39.520]
Cheyenne?

[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:41.460]
What?

[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:42.520]
The idea.

[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:44.360]
He must be Mexican, isn't he?

[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:44.480]
Cheyenne?

[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.000]
She wants you to start getting involved with all those, I mean, one thing they do have in common.

[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.500]
They're all, um, yeah.

[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:53.100]
But beside that, like all you Arabs.

[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.160]
Well, seriously, they're all a bunch of, but you don't want to say the word.

[00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.020]
It begins with an F has two Gs in it.

[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:01.200]
But, uh, I'm like, I'd like to keep Martin.

[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:06.040]
Uh, he's Puerto Rican and Luis Miguel, who like his, uh, whatever he is.

[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:06.500]
He's good.

[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:10.940]
And, uh, Enrique, who is, uh, now Enrique, you would say a Spanish, right?

[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:12.200]
Aren't they like, uh, Spaniards?

[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:12.860]
Yes.

[00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:14.820]
The, uh, Iglesias family.

[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:17.140]
And what about Julio Jr.?

[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:17.500]
What is he?

[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.180]
Don't, don't say it.

[00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:20.800]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:21.800]
Uh, he's like, pretty.

[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.480]
Here is a mobile in Port Saint Lucie.

[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:24.700]
Hello.

[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:25.860]
Say, Neil.

[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:26.400]
Yes, sir.

[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.700]
The two most famous Mexicans of all time.

[00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:31.860]
Hey, Pancho.

[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:33.420]
Hey, Cisco.

[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:34.820]
Yeah, man.

[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:35.100]
Right.

[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:36.500]
The Cisco kid in Pancho.

[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:37.320]
You got him.

[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:37.680]
Okay.

[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:38.180]
Thank you, sir.

[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:42.420]
See, if you're old, uh, an old fart like that guy in me, then you remember the Cisco kid.

[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:45.180]
If you're like, uh, some young whipper snapper, you don't know that good stuff.

[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:47.740]
You don't even remember a hoveloncacity in Gabby Hayes.

[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:51.140]
Part of the wonderful American culture with all the guns and all the stuff.

[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:51.800]
Great time.

[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:52.940]
Now Wild Bill Hickock.

[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:54.640]
What was his name?

[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.420]
Guy Madison played Wild Bill Hickock.

[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:58.140]
Boy, do I have a memory or what for stuff?

[00:58:58.380 --> 00:58:59.280]
Not for important stuff.

[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:02.780]
But for trivial crap, I have a mind like a steel trap.

[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.160]
Raw Hyde, Chuck Connors.

[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:09.180]
Chuck Connors and Raw Hyde, it was the, um, what was he on another one?

[00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:10.140]
Rifleman.

[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:10.460]
Right.

[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:10.920]
Right, right, right, right.

[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:14.280]
Like I said, he was also on Los Angeles Dodgers for about five minutes.

[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:15.100]
Do you know that?

[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:18.260]
Yeah, he was a ball player for about, well, a nitty-nitty-nitty half.

[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:24.280]
He was in roots.

[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:27.320]
Where are Rogers?

[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:31.920]
Connics?

[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:33.940]
What?

[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:34.880]
What about him?

[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.940]
I'm, you think of all the great cobbles.

[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:40.860]
Those are, these are great cultural icons.

[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:43.640]
The American, he's a mental entity.

[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:45.680]
Where we going?

[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:47.580]
Here's the moral gable.

[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:47.820]
Hello.

[00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:48.860]
Hello, Neil.

[00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:49.380]
Yes, sir.

[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.060]
You couldn't have Siko Damiro with Warez.

[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:54.620]
He's responsible for it.

[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:55.320]
He freed Mexico.

[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:57.120]
Warez, Xavier Warez.

[00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:58.300]
Well, there you got it.

[00:59:58.480 --> 00:59:58.720]
Uh-huh.

[00:59:58.940 --> 00:59:59.880]
How about Anthony Quinn?

[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.780]
Yeah, Anthony Quinn, uh-huh.

[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:05.100]
Right, and the guy brought up a punch, oh, it was Leo Carillo.

[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:06.900]
Very excellent, very good.

[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.880]
And who was, uh, who was, uh, Siko?

[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:09.880]
Duncan Renaldo.

[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:10.980]
Duncan, very good.

[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:11.660]
Excellent, sir.

[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.440]
God, if we had a million dollars, we'd send it to you.

[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.140]
And how about, uh, Murrell Oberon?

[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.120]
She was Mexican, Richard.

[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:16.540]
Well, she was.

[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.240]
Uh-huh.

[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:22.440]
And, uh, Diego Rivera and, uh, Neliana Zapata, the great revolutionary.

[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:23.180]
Right.

[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.680]
Oh, there's a few out there.

[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:28.080]
Thank God for you, man, for bringing the Mexicans back up by their bootstraps.

[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.920]
And if you want to go to make, go to the Cabo San Lucas and, uh, Anbaha.

[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:32.620]
Beautiful.

[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:33.320]
Okay.

[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.280]
Right on the coast.

[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:35.140]
I'm going to Acapulco.

[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.020]
I'm going to hang out with Luis.

[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:36.740]
Okay.

[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:37.540]
Okay, see you.

[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:37.860]
Thank you.

[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:38.440]
I'll be there, too.

[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:39.240]
There's a guy.

[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:39.880]
There's a good guy.

[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.640]
Finally, it took us an hour and twenty-one minutes.

[01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:45.640]
There's a guy that brings America, a Mexican culture up to the level that it is appropriate at.

[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.600]
Up to your knee.

[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.700]
So Lorenzo Lamas is from Peru, huh?

[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:52.940]
No, that's, that's the, that's the, that, an unusual thing.

[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.380]
How much do you hear about, like, Peruvians?

[01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:57.680]
Or I'll give you one even better.

[01:00:58.460 --> 01:00:58.780]
Peraguayans.

[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:00.100]
Huh?

[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.380]
Did we talk to anybody from Peraguay?

[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:02.640]
No.

[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.520]
How about Bolivia?

[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:03.860]
No.

[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.420]
How about Simon Boulevard?

[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:08.560]
What?

[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.480]
He's the only one I can name.

[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:10.240]
Yeah.

[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:18.580]
And someone called to say Jeb, Jeb's wife is from Mexico.

[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:19.800]
Yeah.

[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:21.320]
That's why his sons look so good.

[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:22.460]
Oh, I shouldn't have said that.

[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.440]
That's why his sons used to look so good.

[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.440]
They're not looking so good anymore.

[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.080]
Since he got elected governor, they still looking real right wing.

[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.240]
No, seriously, it's not because they look like him.

[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.820]
It's because they look like Yamama.

[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:35.520]
Here's Hollywood.

[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.260]
Did I get that?

[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.380]
I don't want him on the ear.

[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:43.420]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the 18-T wireless line.

[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.960]
Seriously, you know, when they have the next big deal with it,

[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:48.480]
they're rounding up people and saying the camp.

[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.800]
The one that was just on there, I don't want to mention, um,

[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.960]
Hollywood, he's going to be first in line.

[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.700]
Here's a Tamarack.

[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:56.960]
Hello.

[01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:58.100]
Hey, now.

[01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:58.740]
Yes, sir.

[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:00.900]
I got a couple of quick points to make.

[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:06.560]
Famous Mexican that none of these damn nerds have even mentioned.

[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:07.020]
Yeah.

[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:10.000]
You got your TV-seam disk?

[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:11.780]
Yeah.

[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.580]
What about Freddie Prince, man?

[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.320]
Puerto Rican.

[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.960]
Only the freaking Puerto Rican is the same craft anyway.

[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:21.900]
Okay.

[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.480]
And I got another point to make.

[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:23.860]
Yeah.

[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:26.360]
Everybody wants to send a bear to their mother,

[01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:28.000]
send them a box of chocolates.

[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.000]
Let me tell you something.

[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.420]
You want to take care of mom?

[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.880]
You send her a big dot-dam greasy bag of white castles.

[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.540]
Okay, thanks, Wayne.

[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:41.100]
That was Wayne Arnold.

[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:43.660]
What?

[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:46.800]
New Yorker.

[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:48.220]
No, it was Wayne Arnold.

[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:50.080]
Do you know you read New York accent?

[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:54.960]
560-560 on the 18T wireless line.

[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:55.820]
That's not a bad idea.

[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:57.900]
I'll tell you one thing.

[01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:58.580]
Killer.

[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.700]
Now, that's our next poll question.

[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:06.580]
Which one could you have faster about a pound of FLM or about six pack of Wayne Arnold's Royal Castle Burgers?

[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.160]
And the Newbie Burgers would bake it in cheese.

[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.060]
How about both?

[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:15.200]
How about like a little box, a nice box or two of Newbie Burgers would bake it in cheese?

[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.300]
Follow it for dessert.

[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:17.060]
You'll wash it down.

[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.820]
How about about a half a pound of FLM butter crunch?

[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.620]
God, are those things good.

[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.000]
Now, I think I'm calling them by the right butter crisp.

[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:24.720]
That's what they are.

[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:25.580]
Butter crisps.

[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:31.960]
You'll think you died and went to heaven and came back for another go round once you've had a few of those in your purse.

[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:33.680]
Here's Miami.

[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:34.000]
Hello.

[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.300]
Morning, you all right.

[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:35.600]
Great.

[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.400]
I wanted to look, you know something.

[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.120]
I've lived down in Mexico for a couple of years.

[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:40.140]
And you survived it?

[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:41.500]
And I got barely, just barely.

[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:45.140]
But the thing is, you know in Mexico, they don't celebrate a single-day mayo.

[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:46.500]
It's not even well known.

[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.960]
It's more of a chicano or Mexican-American holiday.

[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.840]
So Freddie Prince would have been a good, we should have been more of a chicano kind of representatives, I guess.

[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.340]
So I just want to let you know that.

[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.140]
How about that screener?

[01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:59.020]
What's his name from the chips show?

[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:00.960]
Eric Astraldo.

[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:02.140]
That's peddling those phony vitamins.

[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:02.700]
Where do you like them?

[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:03.340]
What do you see Mexican?

[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.260]
He must be Mexican.

[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:05.680]
Well, he's Mexican-American.

[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.640]
But the Mexican joy don't celebrate the Mexican-American.

[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:11.560]
Yeah, the Mexican national holidays in September, actually.

[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:16.400]
So this is really, they celebrate this more in Texas and California than they would in Mexico.

[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:16.940]
Yeah.

[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.180]
So let's find some chicanos out there.

[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:19.660]
Okay.

[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:21.020]
Hi, bless you, sir.

[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:21.560]
There you go.

[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:23.320]
Erica Strada, how's she doing?

[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.160]
peddling some kind of bogus vibe.

[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.500]
Yeah, these people were losing weight with this crap.

[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.320]
We couldn't believe it.

[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:28.960]
Here, buy some.

[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:29.360]
Come on.

[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:34.600]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the ATT wireless line.

[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.140]
Here's Miami.

[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:36.480]
Hello.

[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.180]
Hello, Neil.

[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:38.680]
Yes, sir.

[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:40.100]
How about skating as well?

[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:41.380]
Yeah.

[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.500]
Okay, thank you.

[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:43.580]

[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.940]
Okay, quick while you're ahead.

[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.400]
Here's a mobile and peppered pine.

[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:47.720]
Hello.

[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:48.940]
And you, how are you?

[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:49.740]
I have a can go.

[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:51.980]
Vinicus Dia, Colorado Rock.

[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.260]
Yeah, we already had three of those.

[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:53.840]
Sorry.

[01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:55.760]
Two of them mispronouncing him, by the way.

[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:57.880]
Oh, give a local way, mad, sir.

[01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.760]
Don't get all bent out of shape about it.

[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.700]
All these baseball fans we got down here, you think?

[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.120]
We really have any baseball fans?

[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:06.300]
Yeah.

[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.820]
We had one guy that's going to the Marlin game.

[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:08.400]
Anybody else?

[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:08.640]
No.

[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:12.420]
Don't forget, Brewer is in the Marlins at the 1230,

[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.400]
just an hour and four minutes from now we got the pregame,

[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.720]
the game at one o'clock today.

[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.720]
You talk about a minute audience.

[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.620]
I'm supposed to pass along that Erica Stratt is a New York Reacon.

[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.080]
Oh, he's Puerto Rican?

[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:23.140]
Oh, that.

[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:23.220]

[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:23.800]
You're, huh?

[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:24.780]
Via New York.

[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.400]
That explains a lot, Erica Stratt.

[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.220]
That damn fact that I can't stand it.

[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:28.840]
Oh, man.

[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:32.440]
Here's a chip off the old, um, something.

[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.600]
Probably from the Bronx.

[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:37.040]
26th after 11 at 560, WQM.

[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:41.100]
And there's a K club out there, especially for our sports

[01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:42.040]
fed radio.

[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.040]
560, WQM.

[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:47.000]
Starting this Monday.

[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.200]
560 WQAM is proud to present

[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:55.200]
Fedsforth Review with Game Bab Teast and Bud Davies.

[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.880]
6th at 10AM Monday through Friday.

[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:02.000]
On 560, WQAM.

[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.980]
7th at 10AM.

[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:08.200]
And then we are ECP IOS.

[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:11.340]
It's a rectum time.

[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:15.040]
I'm gonna kick off my news, drip off my dress.

[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:21.560]
It makes me wet when I see you get a big irrector.

[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.300]
That's too big for my mouth.

[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:28.460]
I want it mercenary and a top of you.

[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:31.840]
And take it up my overcated poofs to

[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:38.180]
Give me an air freshened up and nail pictures of walls.

[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:41.680]
DRECP IOS.

[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.420]
I want a drape car ball.

[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:48.900]
I want to lock the quality of you and to suit your oomsy.

[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.340]
And then I'll give it a blow.

[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.600]
Here's a morning gift.

[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:58.600]
As big as this, a dream sun till you take up this.

[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.140]
I want a wrap on this around your clothing too.

[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:05.440]
And make your wonderworm explode and explode.

[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:07.900]
That's a miracle.

[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.340]
And it's on the circle side.

[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:15.220]
DRECP IOS.

[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.960]
I want a drape car ball.

[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:21.680]
DRECP IOS.

[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:23.380]
I want a 35, 60, WKM.

[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.340]
I'm disappointed in this audience.

[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:29.500]
Somebody made a bad mistake and you people didn't call it correct.

[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:32.620]
Fernando Lamis and therefore his son Lorenzo Lamis.

[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:33.820]
Were they really from Peru?

[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:39.900]
One of our chronic factors is the biography of Fernando Lamis.

[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:40.480]
He's dead.

[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:41.840]
He's been dead a long time.

[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.360]
But he left his Lorenzo behind.

[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.320]
I'll tell you one thing before we got older and hairy,

[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.980]
Lorenzo Lamis may have been the best looking guy that was ever born.

[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:53.020]
I mean, just off hand, I might say that.

[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:54.360]
Off the sand.

[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:55.960]
One with a watch on it.

[01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:02.100]
But anyway, it says, Fernando Lamis, the star of Spanish speaking films in his native country,

[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.960]
which was, let's give them a few guesses.

[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:06.960]
What country was not Peru?

[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:07.800]
That was wrong.

[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:10.700]
We have no prize for you.

[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:12.960]
We want somebody to come up with an answer right away.

[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.200]
Come on online for there.

[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:18.440]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:21.480]
What country was Fernando Lamis and Lorenzo Lamis from?

[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:22.440]
Where were they born?

[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.780]
What country in Latin America?

[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:24.300]
Come on.

[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:25.600]
We're waiting, going once.

[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.000]
Four of them, you know what?

[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:29.180]
Was it Bolivia?

[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:29.740]
No.

[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.200]
Was it Costa Rica?

[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:31.660]
No.

[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:32.680]
Ecuador?

[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:33.080]
No.

[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:33.680]
El Salvador?

[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:34.040]
No.

[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:35.120]
Was it B.

[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:35.560]

[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:36.140]
B.

[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:37.560]
What?

[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:38.400]
Chile?

[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:39.120]
No.

[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:40.700]
Brazil?

[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:41.060]
No.

[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:41.920]
Venezuela?

[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:42.380]
No.

[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:42.860]
Please.

[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:44.080]
WQAM.

[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:47.720]
QAM.

[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:49.980]
You can do it.

[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:53.040]
Put that thing to your mouth.

[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:55.800]
Can't do it.

[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:01.960]
Born January 9th, 1915, Fernando Lamis was born in.

[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:04.960]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.280]
What about your dead heads we got here?

[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:09.600]
I mean, just astonishing to me.

[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:10.580]
WQAM.

[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:11.780]
Hello.

[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:12.340]
Yes, sir.

[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:15.120]
I have a famous Mexican for Neil.

[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:15.580]
Yes.

[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:16.560]
Okay.

[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:18.500]
Where are you calling from?

[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:19.040]
Hollywood.

[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:20.200]
Okay, let's go to Hollywood.

[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:20.560]
Hello.

[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:21.140]
Hollywood.

[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:21.720]
Yes, sir.

[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:23.620]
I got the most famous of all.

[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:24.020]
Okay.

[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:24.740]
Zero.

[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.100]
Okay, thank you.

[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.540]
Oh, you know about zero, don't you?

[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:30.160]
Who played?

[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.700]
Was it George Hamilton that played zero?

[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:32.800]
That damn bagad.

[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:33.680]
I can't stand it.

[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:34.920]
In the gay blade, yeah.

[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:35.880]
Look in the gay blade, yeah.

[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:41.080]
I'm not telling you the original zero was a new guy.

[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:47.020]
I thought I was about to serve him.

[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:48.460]
Well, that's the way before even might.

[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:55.660]
Chuck Conner's, by the way, Los Angeles, Diaries, and Lifehook.

[01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:58.020]
Well, I couldn't find God and Chico and a man on there.

[01:09:58.020 --> 01:09:59.940]
I'm very sorry for our Puerto Rican friends.

[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.820]
Am I going to have to tell them about Fernando Lamis WQAM?

[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:03.880]
God willing.

[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.120]
God willing.

[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.160]
Thank you, was it or thank you Argentina?

[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:08.300]
Excellent.

[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.220]
Thank you so much.

[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:12.040]
There's the guy we, if we had a prize, we'd send this guy to the Marlon game.

[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.300]
And then they wouldn't let him out.

[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:20.060]
Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1915, Fernando Lamis,

[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.040]
who was with a slick as a bowling ball.

[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.620]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the 18 T.

[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:29.100]
Wattles line.

[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:30.760]
Only took us 10 minutes to get the answer.

[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:31.720]
That they're a little bit slow.

[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.360]
And whoever called and said they were from Peru,

[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:36.060]
shame on you, see Lamis.

[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.260]
That's why they came up with that.

[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:37.520]
Okay?

[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:40.120]
Lamis, Peru, you following that at all?

[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:40.460]
No.

[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:40.980]
Yeah.

[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:45.340]
Don't go jumping to conclusions like that just because the name sounds the same.

[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:47.200]
Here's Miami.

[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:47.540]
Hello?

[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:49.100]
Yes, sir.

[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:49.580]
Good morning.

[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:50.260]
Buenos Tuyah.

[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:55.680]
I think I have a, since today's Puerto Rican and the Mexican Day show,

[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:57.940]
I think I have proof that yes, there is a God.

[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:02.200]
Every morning I wake up and I thank God I'm out of Mexican Puerto Rican.

[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.400]
Oh, it's worth it.

[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:07.740]
Here's a four-letter day.

[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:07.980]
Hello?

[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:09.420]
Accomereo.

[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.600]
Is it pronounced llamas or llama?

[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:12.800]
Yama, see ya.

[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:13.220]
Yama.

[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.120]
Yama.

[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:16.080]
I got three famous Mexicans for you.

[01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:16.400]
Okay.

[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:18.180]
We got the Taco Bell Chihuahua.

[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.120]
Yeah, already got them.

[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.180]
Carlos Santana.

[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:21.000]
Already got them.

[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.340]
And the guy that spelled my watch in cousin though.

[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.060]
Okay, thank you.

[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:26.380]
Probably more famous than either the other.

[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:30.220]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the 18 T wireless line.

[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:34.420]
Don't want to let the day go by since we only got a few minutes till that ballgame at 12.30.

[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:41.000]
Without the most important story of the day, toilet paper or burning issue in schools, new holders costly.

[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:46.860]
You know, how many times have we talked on this show about parents and their bratty little obnoxious kids?

[01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:50.080]
And you wonder why all these horrendous things are going on all over this country?

[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.020]
What kind of parents we got?

[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:55.440]
Who don't notice little things like barrels of sought-off shotguns,

[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:58.180]
sitting on Eric's dresser, little things like that.

[01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:58.940]
All of these things.

[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:06.280]
They just seem to, you know, all those aplastic bombs and aggroage, all those little things that just seem to escape the eye of mom and dad.

[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:09.520]
Or too busy and moving up the ladder in the social world or whatever they're doing.

[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:23.060]
The Broward School District plans to spend $15,400 on metal toilet paper holders for school bathrooms at $11 a piece to replace the plastic holders that they consider a fire hazard.

[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:26.380]
Money down the toilet. It asks, this is in this morning's hero.

[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.740]
School officials say this is no laughing matter.

[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:38.760]
It seems that trouble-making students have discovered they can spark an impressive blaze by putting a max to the thick rolls of toilet paper inside the plastic holders.

[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:48.100]
The burning paper and melting plastic sent clouds of toxic smoke billowing into the school, tripping fire alarms and disrupting classes.

[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:53.600]
A recent toilet paper fired at Helen Dale High School, fourth administrators to close school for the day.

[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:59.120]
Students will set fire to anything said Roger Childers, a manager in the district's maintenance department.

[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:08.020]
In 1994, the district replaced wooden toilet seats with fire-resistant plastic following a fire that began a top of toilet at Cooper City High School.

[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.620]
They were smoking on the toilet. How do you like that?

[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:14.840]
Childers said it's pitiful. That's what it is.

[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:15.140]
Oh!

[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.900]
At a boy, Roger. Right out of target as usual.

[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:31.140]
Got to put in metal toilet paper holders because these punks, your kids are in their own school, setting the goddamn toilet paper on fire and disrupting a whole goddamn everybody's life.

[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:41.660]
Because of your bratty little kids that are running around in the supermarkets in the drug stores in every goddamn store in the universe, acting like a bunch of bratty little kids and disrupting everybody else's life.

[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:42.980]
So why should we be any different in school?

[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:50.100]
Let me say it again, those two magic words that I find even more appealing than nursing home, two different words today.

[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.020]
Fourth sterilization baby.

[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:52.360]
Ow!

[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:52.460]
Ow!

[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.280]
Assholes making babies.

[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.480]
And we can't figure out what else going on.

[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:07.020]
Yeah, I don't know. I wonder why Eric had that sawdust shock on his dresser.

[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:11.000]
He probably just pooled around.

[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:15.980]
What about they were breaking all that glass in the garage, you know?

[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:21.500]
21 before noon at 560 WQM if you're stuck.

[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.860]
Neil God, Ow! WQKM.

[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.660]
Where the fat is?

[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.320]
The fat is...

[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.820]
The fat is...

[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:36.660]
The fat is...

[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:37.060]
The fat is...

[01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:38.660]
The fat is...

[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:40.800]
The fat is...

[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.860]
The fat is...

[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:55.660]
The fat is...

[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.640]
The fat is...

[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.480]
The fat is...

[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:05.120]
And it's said to put the bell鈶.

[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:09.720]
Is it really more the pop粉 you would want?

[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:12.800]
It information is higher than Jack Kloos.

[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.700]
It's not Jack Kloos.

[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:20.680]
And it's not Jack Kloos.

[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:25.000]
And it comes without a time apart.

[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.840]
My favorite person, you're the favorite step.

[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:32.920]
You picked the shells on you with all these balls.

[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:36.060]
We gave brushes on the pants and balls.

[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.820]
That jack bowl.

[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:43.900]
That's the jack bowl.

[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:47.820]
Of the star of jack bowl.

[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.680]
They got it on its nose.

[01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:59.720]
That jack bowl.

[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:03.400]
That jack bowl.

[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.140]
That jack bowl.

[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.000]
That jack bowl.

[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.400]
That jack bowl.

[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:15.040]
Always wondered about the ramp on the top.

[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:19.420]
I don't want to go to that thing yet about the wrist.

[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.880]
I don't want to go to that thing.

[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:23.040]

[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:28.780]
That's what they always say.

[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:32.780]
I'm full Charlie.

[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:38.540]
It was a regular chip off the old lock.

[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:41.280]
That's our poll question.

[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:44.740]
That's hard.

[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:46.640]
That is really hard.

[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:51.080]
560.560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:55.980]
William Prawley, who was on I Love Loosely, who played the Fred Merch.

[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:01.480]
F.O. Merch was Vivian Vance in your pants.

[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.860]
And of course Desi Arneza was a f***ing.

[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:08.360]
560.560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:09.280]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.520]
Yes sir.

[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:12.260]
Alina.

[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:15.820]
Alina.

[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.040]
Alina or Serena?

[01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:21.660]
Alina.

[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:36.740]
Alina.

[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:39.040]
I'm so sorry that I brought it up.

[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:43.080]
It's better than talking about f***ing like we did yesterday.

[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:44.300]
They're out.

[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:46.720]
Here's Miami.

[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:48.440]
Yes sir.

[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:49.200]
I think they're passing.

[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:49.780]
I'm not sure.

[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:51.140]
That's kind of weird.

[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:56.160]
Anyways, you were talking yesterday about the Cuban banning the cigar.

[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:59.740]
This guy say f***ing.

[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:04.180]
The Indian failed the cigar.

[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:08.820]
In a way, they're doing the same thing that they hate the bearded one for.

[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:10.900]
The communist censorship.

[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.700]
They're trying to bring it over here.

[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:14.140]
But they didn't mind what Batista did.

[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.160]
She was okay then.

[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:16.520]
Well, we're not a doubt.

[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.140]
This is becoming very bad out of what republic not ours anymore.

[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.800]
You know, toilet paper things?

[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.840]
I don't even know why they bother having those rings.

[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:25.880]
You have a mizahico here in South Florida.

[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:27.380]
But I'm sure George comes out for this.

[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:32.620]
I don't know anybody who's brave enough to take a crap in our public school bathroom.

[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:33.200]
Why is that?

[01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:34.400]
Why is that?

[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:39.200]
I've seen things in public school bathrooms that I couldn't believe emanated from a human.

[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:43.040]
If you can believe they're worse than our restrooms here.

[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:44.140]
They are.

[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:45.160]
Our restrooms here aren't bad.

[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.040]
There's nothing wrong with our toilets.

[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:47.180]
They have no ventilation.

[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:49.560]
Yeah, after some people use them, you don't want to go in there.

[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:50.820]
So, others, they smell like a toilet.

[01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:52.920]
They pee all over the place.

[01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:53.860]
They smell like a sewer.

[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:59.620]
And there's like splotched, wet, like, you know, when kids throw like wet toilet paper in it hardens.

[01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.240]
And it looks like plastic.

[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:02.160]
When it gets hard, yeah.

[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:04.160]
Yeah, it's all over the place.

[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:05.360]
And, you know.

[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:08.080]
Well, what kind of scumbags are we raising in these schools today?

[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:09.280]
What the hell is going on?

[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:11.220]
I don't want to sound like some old funny dutty.

[01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:14.280]
But what kind of parents are raising these aberrant children?

[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:15.140]
Cool, you know.

[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:16.480]
Oh, okay, thank you.

[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:18.700]
We don't even need to get a license or anything to have a kid.

[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:19.940]
I mean, any idiot can have a kid, right?

[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.120]
Right. There you go.

[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.220]
Okay, thanks for the good news.

[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:23.680]
Okay, we're going to move.

[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.840]
We're going to move to Cologne, Germany, where we're going to move.

[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:29.300]
And then you'll march, you'll go step to a different drummer.

[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:30.240]
I'll tell you that right now.

[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:33.240]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, POM 5.

[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:36.400]
Seriously, I don't know what kind of people you are that raise these kids.

[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.740]
They let them just run rough shot over everything.

[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.760]
You go into the market, you go, I've told these stories.

[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:42.120]
I know it gets really ponderous.

[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.640]
But it gets on everybody's nerves.

[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:44.980]
We're all sick and tired of it.

[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:49.460]
You're ready, little, snotty kids that are running around, grabbing stuff,

[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:52.100]
and tossing stuff, and eating food in the goddamn supermarket,

[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:53.860]
and poaching you around with crap.

[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.600]
Good smack on the side of the head.

[01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:59.140]
A good whack. That's what they need.

[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.400]
Forget about Dr. Spock. He's dead.

[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.440]
Forget about Mr. Spock.

[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:06.200]
Well, we never even got into that today.

[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:06.860]
We'll do that tomorrow.

[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:10.080]
Star Wars and Star Trek rhymes with Dreck.

[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.320]
Oh, please.

[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.980]
There are me, the pain, okay?

[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.760]
The only reason that you're not as embarrassed as

[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:17.980]
because we don't have a word like Trek easy yet to describe

[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:19.820]
the Star Wars groupies.

[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:20.680]
Let's make one up.

[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:23.060]
How about assholes?

[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.000]
How about no-lives?

[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:28.020]
We'll all do a apology to George and Joe Castello.

[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:29.120]
And everyone else in the world.

[01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:30.740]
He's got an excuse.

[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:32.300]
He shaved his nuts.

[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.540]
So it's obviously having some kind of adverse effect

[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:36.660]
on where his brain used to be.

[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:40.300]
But in your case, what's your, oh, I know, your excuse is your, uh,

[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:43.100]
here's a mobile and Hollywood.

[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:43.460]
Hello.

[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:44.460]
Hey, Neil.

[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:45.040]
Yes, sir.

[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:48.440]
I've got a famous Mexican guy in a famous Mexican city.

[01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:49.000]
Okay.

[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.820]
The famous Mexican city is Detroit.

[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.320]
It's the birthplace of the Chevy.

[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:59.200]
And the famous Mexican guy is, you know, remember F-Truth

[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:00.700]
that one marked that Arty guy?

[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:01.820]
Yeah.

[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.160]
The greasy little guy, that guy.

[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:04.960]
I think I got F-Truth on this thing here.

[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:05.260]
One of these.

[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:05.580]
Go ahead.

[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:07.740]
But I don't know what his name is.

[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.480]
He's on the love boat a lot too.

[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:11.820]
Rave Villaches.

[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:13.620]
You mean the Midget?

[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:15.040]
No, he's not the Midget.

[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.300]
No, he's just that Arty guy.

[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:16.300]

[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:18.140]
What about Rave Villaches, the Midget?

[01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:19.160]
Wasn't he, uh, Mexican?

[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.860]
He was always on there with the, uh, Ricardo Montobon.

[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:22.900]
That was the love boat.

[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:23.720]
He cleans, you guys.

[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:23.920]
Clean.

[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:24.940]
Well, same thing.

[01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:25.600]
He cleans.

[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:28.200]
How do you like that, huh?

[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:29.280]
I like that.

[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:29.740]
Okay.

[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:40.720]
Hey, how come down grading?

[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.020]
Never wore those green tights.

[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:45.440]
Okay, let's go to, uh, Carl Springs.

[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:45.640]
Hello.

[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:48.120]
Hello, Neil.

[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:48.620]
Yes, sir.

[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:49.380]
How are you, sir?

[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:49.720]
Great.

[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:51.780]
Okay, I've got a famous Mexican.

[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:53.980]
This is really a Mexican.

[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:56.740]
Remember the Gucci, Gucci girl, Charles?

[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:57.160]
Sure.

[01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:57.920]
Okay.

[01:21:58.180 --> 01:21:59.580]
And then, the Hollywood square.

[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:00.320]
That's it.

[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.420]
From the real Hollywood square.

[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.960]
Not the piece of crap they got on now.

[01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:04.720]
Hollywood square.

[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:08.240]
The other one was, you wanted a verification on Chayenne.

[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:08.760]
Yeah.

[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:10.020]
Chayenne is Puerto Rican.

[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:11.180]
Oh, my God.

[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:13.540]
From Mayagüez, Puerto Rico.

[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:14.020]
See?

[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:14.780]
Okay.

[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.620]
So you got Ricky Martin and Chayenne.

[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:17.260]
That's right.

[01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:18.120]
Then here's the lift.

[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:18.680]
That's something.

[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:19.220]
That's a start.

[01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:21.140]
And a little piece of Luis Miguel.

[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:21.800]
That's right.

[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:23.520]
Your head already talked about Freddie Prince.

[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:24.060]
Right.

[01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:24.820]
Okay.

[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.580]
Then the guy who spent a lot of time on his knees,

[01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:29.900]
the first original Marlin catcher,

[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.180]
Benito Santiago.

[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:32.500]
Benito Santiago, right.

[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:33.260]
Yeah.

[01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:35.140]
With his blue porc that he used to drive around out there

[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:35.880]
in the plantation.

[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:36.240]
That's right.

[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.040]
Then he crashed his.

[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:37.780]
Okay.

[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:40.280]
Then Raul Julia.

[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:41.300]
For Ricky.

[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:42.660]
Julia Child.

[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:43.220]
No.

[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:43.920]
Raul.

[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:44.840]
Raul Julia.

[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:46.760]
What wasn't that the Julia?

[01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:47.700]
No.

[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:48.160]
Julio.

[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000]
Raul Julia.

[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:50.540]
Okay.

[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:54.600]
Then the man who spent a vampire.

[01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:57.480]
Oh, that Roberto.

[01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:58.780]
Roberto Alomar.

[01:22:59.660 --> 01:22:59.820]
Yeah.

[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.580]
Well, you know what the empire,

[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:03.780]
you know what the empire is always say about Roberto Valamar.

[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:05.700]
That stands back and I can't stand it.

[01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:08.600]
Then you have which maybe by he's a spin to that.

[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:11.540]
Then you have Jennifer Lopez for the weekend.

[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:12.700]
Yeah.

[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.780]
He saw through a medal.

[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.740]
The ones from the original Batman for the weekend.

[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:19.820]
Georgia's taking a said no.

[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:20.420]
What was it?

[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.000]
It wasn't for the role.

[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:22.320]

[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:22.320]

[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:23.960]
It was a role.

[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.400]
Well, it was a.

[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:25.960]
In.

[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:26.580]
Are you serious?

[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.160]
No way.

[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:27.680]
No way.

[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:28.380]
No way.

[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:28.540]
No way.

[01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:29.000]
No way.

[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:29.040]

[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:34.700]
No way.

[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:35.700]
No way.

[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:35.700]

[01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:37.540]
Then the role.

[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:37.780]
And the role.

[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:38.760]
The role was portarican.

[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:40.920]
These are no meadow with two.

[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:41.920]
They are not Caesar.

[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:42.760]
Don't say Caesar.

[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:43.920]
Cesar.

[01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:46.440]
Cesar whatever his name was.

[01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:47.520]
Cesar.

[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:48.200]
Oh no.

[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.000]
Cesar salad.

[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:49.220]
No.

[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.320]
Cesar Romero.

[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:52.740]
What a rig.

[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:53.680]
Well, I like the way I said that.

[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:55.540]
Don't you like the way I like to roll my arms there?

[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:55.940]
Beautiful.

[01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:00.480]
Now the things you wanted to get rid of the thing in school,

[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:04.780]
the difference between religion and morality classes in school.

[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:12.520]
Why don't they just take away all the different religious things that they teach in school and have these people that you talked about before?

[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:19.360]
The parents that are forced to go to school to teach kids something just come up with a class called morality class.

[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.240]
The difference between good and bad.

[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:34.300]
And then that way, the majority of the parents that are forced and get our maturity duty would have to go take at least a certain amount of time in school to teach the kids what's the difference between right and wrong.

[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:36.580]
Okay, and give them like a whip would be good too.

[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:36.980]
Exactly.

[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:38.380]
We just crossed this.

[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:38.940]
So leave it there to you.

[01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:39.300]
Say goodbye.

[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.560]
Okay, 5, 6, 7, over there.

[01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:43.120]
Now that guy had some heavy duty material.

[01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:43.480]
Okay.

[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:46.140]
We've been through this, says our Romero thing.

[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.260]
I just love that name.

[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:48.620]
And he was good.

[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:50.160]
He was a good inventor.

[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.780]
So Tarot was from Espanya.

[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:53.520]
Chaldo was from Espanya.

[01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:57.300]
And now we've come like Barthalona where they speak with the list Barthalona.

[01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:58.020]
I don't know.

[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:00.820]
Now what about Enrique is that his story is he from Barthalona?

[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:01.700]
I love you Enrique.

[01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:03.140]
By the way, I haven't forgotten about you.

[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:08.160]
How come Staddon bring us that disc today because he's shown you several people call to say about Staddon.

[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:12.580]
Yes, but he was a he was actually a relative of Jose Martí.

[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:14.840]
Oh so he was a wow.

[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:18.400]
So out of west now why don't we build a statue to him, we could all agree on that.

[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:19.400]
Sure.

[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:21.680]
in his Joker outfit, it does not affect.

[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:22.920]
He was great as the Joker.

[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:24.540]
Okay now, who did you like better?

[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:25.500]
Do you like Burgess Meredith?

[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:26.880]
Say Sato Merro.

[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.480]
Who we are, Frank Gorshin.

[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:31.140]
He was good.

[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:32.480]
He's also dead by the way.

[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.160]
Aren't they all dead?

[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:34.460]
Cesar Romero is dead.

[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:35.840]
Burgess Meredith is dead.

[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:37.840]
Frank Gorshin died at a very early age.

[01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:38.660]
A premature death.

[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:40.500]
Who else was in there?

[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:42.820]
Who were some of the other, who was the cat women?

[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:44.280]
Eartha-kit and-

[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.200]
Eartha-kit, is she dead?

[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:45.780]
No.

[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:46.960]
Damn it.

[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:49.500]
She wants bit somebody on the living room.

[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:51.660]
Do you remember that Eartha-kit wants bit somebody

[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:53.000]
on the lip, that crazy bitch?

[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:57.120]
You ever see Eartha-kit and Johnny Mathas together, by the way?

[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.220]
I'm positive it's the same person.

[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:01.760]
W-Q-A-M.

[01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:03.980]
Yeah, a bunch of V-A-I-K-I-M.

[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:05.620]
Yeah.

[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:06.680]
Okay.

[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:07.920]
We got them by the short hairs.

[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:08.720]
Good leader.

[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:09.240]
Okay.

[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:10.560]
Definitely to your leader.

[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:11.800]
W-Q-A-M.

[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:15.540]
Yeah, I'll be forgetting our biggest Mexican imports

[01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:16.820]
for Nando Valenzuela.

[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.660]
We already had his fed-ass.

[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:19.160]
Thank you, sir.

[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:19.900]
We already had an effect.

[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.400]
And actually, I'm glad is the guy called about that

[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.940]
because if I wouldn't have a recall that today,

[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:27.060]
it would have probably slipped away from my memory forever.

[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:28.720]
It's been fed-

[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:29.120]
Not dead yet.

[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:30.220]
Ants he is.

[01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:31.600]
Somebody said he wasn't doing that.

[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:34.040]
Frank Gorshin, I would bet you a lot of your money.

[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:36.660]
That Frank Gorshin is dead as a doormail.

[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:37.300]
Are you sure?

[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:38.280]
Are you positive?

[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:39.040]
Are you sure?

[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.020]
Oh, that's what the guy said.

[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:41.600]
Well, be there.

[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:42.460]
I think he's right, though.

[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:43.380]
I think I saw him on TV.

[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:43.940]
Not so long ago.

[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:44.900]
Frank Gorshin is alive.

[01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:47.420]
He's still drunk and stumbling around.

[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:49.140]
Like William Holden?

[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:50.600]
He's dead.

[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:53.040]
Let me say it again.

[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:54.760]
The great actor's, I don't want to get into this today

[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:56.280]
because we only got 35 minutes.

[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:57.360]
We got that stupid ball game.

[01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.300]
Just when the show is getting hot, baby.

[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:00.760]
Just when we're getting rolling here.

[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:02.680]
Just when we're really getting into it heavy duty,

[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:04.080]
when the audience finally is catching on

[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.140]
to what we're talking about.

[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:07.040]
Now we got to say goodbye in 35 minutes

[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:09.100]
because we got a stupid goddamn Marlon game.

[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:10.820]
Dave O'Brien was right.

[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:14.400]
You see what Dave O'Brien said in the paper this morning

[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:16.020]
that then I always loved Dave O'Brien.

[01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:17.000]
He said about the Marlon.

[01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:17.580]
They stopped.

[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:18.320]
At a boy, Dave.

[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:19.560]
Tell it like it is.

[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:20.940]
Don't sugarcoat it for anybody.

[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:22.560]
Joe Angel, he's okay.

[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:24.740]
He's still doing his John Miller acting class.

[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:26.420]
But Dave O'Brien is great.

[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:27.780]
We love Dave O'Brien, right?

[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:28.360]
Do we love him?

[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:28.920]
Or what?

[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:29.480]
Yes.

[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.800]
Because he said they stunk.

[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:34.080]
Frank Gorshin is alive and well living in Connecticut.

[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:36.320]
You call that being alive?

[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:39.040]
Bridgeport?

[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:41.160]
Yeah, Frank with all.

[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:41.940]
Thank God there's one.

[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:43.000]
Oh, thank God for that.

[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:43.960]
He's good, Frank Gorshin.

[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:46.240]
Got that jaw that protrudes.

[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:47.340]
You know, he's got that thing.

[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:49.660]
He's got a thing that protrudes.

[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:53.160]
Four minutes before noon at 560 WQM, you know.

[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.140]
The community has got six meetings.

[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:57.280]
Don't forget to stay here.

[01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:58.460]
They're my friends.

[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:00.020]
What's going on here?

[01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:02.620]
In video stores now.

[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:07.840]
From the producer of Star Wars and the director of Star Trek,

[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:08.900]
it's Star Trek.

[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:10.660]
The Empire strikes back.

[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:12.560]
The Empire shall be over the throne, of course.

[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.060]
Eat me, Spock.

[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:16.900]
Sir, would you mind explaining that to people please?

[01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:18.480]
Eat me, Bersonari.

[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:19.860]
The best quite impossible.

[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:23.640]
As the witness to you, that your empire is illogical.

[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:24.640]
Bite me, Kirk.

[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:27.440]
I wonder what Starfleet Command will say about that.

[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.660]
Star Trek, the Empire strikes back.

[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.460]
Spock, I have your father.

[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:33.780]
Bersonari, it seems they're bisexual.

[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:36.520]
No, that's just lovely.

[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:39.740]
But yes, I wonder what Starfleet Command will say about that.

[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:42.400]
Like William Schaden would say, get a life.

[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:47.760]
1202 at 560, WDQM, and 1202, that means we've got 28 minutes left.

[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:49.020]
And we've got to get that line of hair.

[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:50.460]
Jesus, Kate Christ.

[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:52.240]
Kind of crap is that.

[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:54.980]
Like I said, we just started building up a little bit of momentum.

[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:58.600]
Here's the fact it says Vincent Price has egghead and Batman.

[01:28:58.600 --> 01:28:59.420]
He's also dead.

[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:00.560]
Obviously buried dead.

[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:02.700]
You remember egghead?

[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:03.460]
I don't.

[01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:06.440]
I remember Vincent Price even being in the Batman.

[01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:08.800]
But nevertheless, I'm sure since you and this boxer say it's true,

[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:09.900]
it must be true, maybe.

[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:11.440]
He's dead.

[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:12.520]
Vincent Price, he was great.

[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.060]
Like I started saying all the great actors, William Holden, Humphrey Bullguard,

[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:20.780]
Terry Grant, Spencer Tracy, Gregory Schmeck.

[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:22.160]
Huh?

[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:23.720]
Marlon's still kicking them.

[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:25.860]
But he's not contemporary.

[01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:26.680]
He's ancient.

[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.800]
I thought you were talking about ancient.

[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.020]
I am.

[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:36.480]
But I'm saying, I mean, Robert Dubham, I'm talking as compared to it like lately.

[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:38.500]
People just came along in the last 10, 20 years.

[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:39.240]
Forget it.

[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:40.860]
Except for Mickey work.

[01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:43.300]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:43.640]
Hello.

[01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:46.280]
Mobile in Hollywood.

[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:50.260]
Going once, going twice, they died.

[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:51.820]
They're dying in Hollywood, baby.

[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:52.720]
Just take a look at them.

[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:54.280]
Here's a mobile in Hope Sound.

[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:54.560]
Hello.

[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:56.280]
Yeah, and how you doing, Neil?

[01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:56.540]
Great.

[01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:01.100]
I'd like to put a vote in for, line would be the Taco Bell dog.

[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:01.660]
Yeah.

[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:03.680]
That's my favorite.

[01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:03.940]
Okay.

[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:04.400]
Thank you, sir.

[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:08.460]
That's our 400th vote for the Taco Bell dog, who obviously transcends all of Mexico

[01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:10.780]
on a, by a million miles, and he ain't even a Mexican.

[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:12.520]
No one said the Frito Bandito yet.

[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:14.020]
What about the Mexican hairless?

[01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:15.740]
Is that, is that a real thing or something?

[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:16.620]
Just make that up.

[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:18.100]
Trawawa, is that, is it synonymous?

[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:18.980]
Is it the same thing?

[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:20.880]
I guess.

[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:22.260]
Well, let's get the doggy book out.

[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:23.340]
Should we get the doggy book out?

[01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:23.520]
No.

[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:24.120]
No, let's not.

[01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:27.480]
Neil, would you look up the Mexican hairless on the list?

[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:28.540]
Where's my hairless?

[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:31.160]
I'll tell you where your hairless is.

[01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:33.900]
Let's go to a Tamarack.

[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:34.120]
Hello.

[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:34.880]
Neil.

[01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:35.500]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:35.960]
Good morning.

[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:37.240]
When is the afternoon?

[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:40.820]
When is the history professor, the Hispanic and Hispanic descendant?

[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:41.180]
See?

[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:43.020]
Are you ready for the list I got here for you?

[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:43.360]
Okay.

[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:43.800]
Mexican Americans.

[01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:44.520]
I'm ready.

[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:45.500]
Sir Chavez.

[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:47.460]
Henry Barbosa.

[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:48.140]
Henry Gonzalez.

[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:48.920]
The congressman.

[01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:49.680]
See?

[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:50.600]
Joanne Bias.

[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:52.620]
Wait a minute.

[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:52.900]
Who?

[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:53.600]
Joanne Bias.

[01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:54.400]
Joanne Bias.

[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:55.800]
Joanne Bias.

[01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:56.080]
Yeah.

[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:56.660]
Joanne Bias.

[01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:56.940]
Yeah.

[01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:01.140]
From the 60s.

[01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:01.680]
That's right.

[01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:02.840]
We hang with was Mexican.

[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:03.420]
Very good.

[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:04.180]
Anthony Queen.

[01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:04.880]
Hal Vary.

[01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:05.580]
Help Mexican.

[01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:07.360]
Lietra Vino.

[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:08.040]
Right.

[01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:08.520]
We got that.

[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:09.460]
No golfers, please.

[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:10.400]
Nancy Lopez.

[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:11.540]
Like I said.

[01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:12.400]
So we're about that.

[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:13.180]
Linda Ronstadt.

[01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:15.120]
Linda Ronstadt is Mexican.

[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:15.900]
Yes, sir.

[01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:16.700]
When I made Hikana.

[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:18.500]
Oh my God.

[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.100]
I love Lagrangian.

[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:22.440]
For Ecopenia.

[01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:24.980]
Martin Sheen.

[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:26.020]
Martin Sheenie is.

[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:26.700]
Yeah.

[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:27.140]
He's father.

[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:30.220]
I think she is not his name.

[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:31.120]
Well, maybe that's why his name is.

[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.440]
He's real name is.

[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:34.380]
He's real name is.

[01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:35.040]
What is his name?

[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:35.480]
What is his name?

[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:35.640]
What is his name?

[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:35.880]
What is his name?

[01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:36.500]
His name is Emilio.

[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:39.860]
He just changed his name to Sheen because he found that better.

[01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:41.120]
He's in an Anglo-influenza.

[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:43.580]
He figured it would work really well in the Sheenie Alps.

[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:43.760]

[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:44.080]
Right.

[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:45.300]
Ramon Novaro.

[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:46.420]
Ramon Novaro.

[01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:47.140]
I remember him.

[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:47.780]
Of course.

[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:48.820]
He was swashi.

[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:51.160]
He was Richard Pantragons' Alice.

[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.020]
Remember from the 60s tennis play.

[01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:53.280]
Right.

[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:53.580]
Of course.

[01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:54.880]
Ricardo Montoban.

[01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:55.600]
We got him.

[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:57.780]
Oscar de la Olia.

[01:31:57.820 --> 01:31:58.900]
He's not Ricardo Montoban.

[01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:01.220]
I think he's doing that cart those spots that he has been.

[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.040]
I get him confused with Fernando Lama.

[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:03.360]
Sorry.

[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:04.900]
Is Richard Balan's?

[01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:06.140]
Richard Balan's very dead.

[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:07.160]
Edward James Olmos.

[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:08.180]
Big Gabbopper.

[01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:08.860]
He was good Mexican.

[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:10.700]
Hi, Trini Lopez and Biggie Carr.

[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:11.860]
He was Olmos Mexican.

[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:13.840]
Fernando Balan Suela.

[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:14.400]
Right.

[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:15.300]
Trini Lopez.

[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:17.680]
If I had a hammer, I'd bust every record he ever made.

[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:20.920]
And the one that's going with Louis Miguel now.

[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:21.920]
She's not Mexican.

[01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:23.120]
Mariah Carey.

[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:23.660]
She's from Venezuela.

[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:25.360]
Oh, poor Luis.

[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:27.160]
That won't last long.

[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:27.860]
Okay.

[01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:29.060]
Thanks for the great news.

[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:30.100]
I'll be better at time, Neil.

[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:30.520]
Okay.

[01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:32.920]
Well, there's a long list.

[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.560]
For you see, we started the show off with very little response because people like to put down

[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:37.780]
other groups of people, you know.

[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:39.680]
My people are better than your people.

[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:40.820]
My religion, you know, that crap.

[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:43.020]
Look at all these famous Mexicans.

[01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:44.980]
Two hours and five minutes later, we got one.

[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:45.560]
Three or four.

[01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:46.380]
It's not bad.

[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.240]
One or two Puerto Ricans.

[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:51.860]
Now let's start talking about famous Jews.

[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:52.920]
There you go.

[01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:54.540]
Mike Spindell.

[01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:56.180]
That's not fair.

[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:57.080]
What?

[01:32:58.080 --> 01:32:59.900]
The Jews run the whole show business in this.

[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:00.780]
Let me ask you this.

[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:03.620]
How many compared a number of people in the world?

[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:06.580]
How many Hispanics are there compared to the number of us Jews left?

[01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:08.280]
And I'm in the line of the word left.

[01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:10.440]
After all, you go and exterminate most of us.

[01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:13.060]
How many are Jews compared to Hispanics?

[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:16.520]
Hispanics are overpopulated in the world because they're a lot to be told to be happy.

[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:20.400]
Just in South America alone, there must be what?

[01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:22.100]
Two trillion in the sticks down there.

[01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:23.920]
Four or five trillion?

[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:25.880]
Cuban is only six percent of them.

[01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:26.560]
Did you say?

[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:28.960]
He won't stop.

[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:30.600]
He will not stop.

[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:32.240]
He's compulsive.

[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:33.980]
I'm trying to cure you of being a professional.

[01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:35.160]
You won't stop.

[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:36.440]
You're a professional Jew.

[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:37.540]
The hell I am.

[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:40.820]
Professional Jew, your FNA, baby.

[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:41.800]
Say it.

[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:42.340]
I love that.

[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:45.180]
Did you ever see any good Cuban?

[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:48.920]
Yeah, I almost said I didn't put the end on it though.

[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:51.580]
Did you ever see any good Hispanic Kishki?

[01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:51.960]
Huh?

[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:52.640]
No.

[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:56.000]
Never seen any Mexican Pastrani?

[01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:56.380]
No.

[01:33:57.860 --> 01:33:59.020]
Chilean the Mata Balls?

[01:33:59.020 --> 01:33:59.180]
No.

[01:33:59.500 --> 01:33:59.900]
Haleva?

[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:00.260]
No.

[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:00.960]
There you go.

[01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:07.140]
But now, if we want to start out with famous Jews for crying out loud, we'll do that tomorrow.

[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:08.160]
It's not fair.

[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:09.400]
You run the entire industry.

[01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:11.560]
What do you mean we run the entire industry?

[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:16.280]
Now you start and sound like one of those damn right-wing like Dr. Kennedy up there at the full range.

[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:17.300]
You need the music industry.

[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:18.980]
All your backstreet boys and everything.

[01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:19.840]
Backstreet boys.

[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:20.380]
Is there Jewish?

[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:22.200]
The guy that hired them?

[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:23.320]
Did they got them together?

[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:24.020]
How do you know that?

[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:25.280]
Louis Pearlman.

[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:27.060]
Big Papa, they call him.

[01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:28.900]
I wonder why they call him that.

[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:32.260]
I wonder if Nick Carter calls him Big Papa?

[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:36.060]
How about Mama Love Papa?

[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:40.300]
He even mentioned the backstreet boys.

[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:43.120]
He's tried to make up for the fact that he said it slipped out.

[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:44.620]
You're right.

[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:44.960]
Almost.

[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:46.720]
I left the in-year off.

[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.480]
And of course we left out Gloria Estefan.

[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:50.500]
We know she's Puerto Rican.

[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:51.580]
Oh, sorry.

[01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:54.480]
I don't want to think she is a pain in the ass.

[01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:55.400]
Boy, I can't stand her.

[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:56.520]
And her pain in the ass husband?

[01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:57.100]
God.

[01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:58.740]
What is the big deal with them?

[01:34:58.860 --> 01:34:59.300]
They must be.

[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:02.060]
Eight minutes past noon.

[01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:04.600]
We got the Marlins and the Milwaukee Brewers.

[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:05.100]
You know something?

[01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:07.560]
I'm starting to get a quiver in my backroom.

[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.760]
I'm thinking about the fact we got that game on this afternoon.

[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:11.740]
We just had this great book come out.

[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:13.780]
And here we got this awful ball game come at him.

[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.560]
I mean, nobody's even attending in the stand.

[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:16.700]
Do you think anybody's going to be listening?

[01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:17.540]
No.

[01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:20.940]
Boy, if I was Greg Reed, then thank God I'm not.

[01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:26.480]
But if I were, I would be hanging my head in shame at the idea that we're taking off these two

[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:32.380]
high rated programs, the Near Rogers and the Henry Goldberg show, and putting on a bunch of Marlins will here right in the middle of the daytime.

[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:38.260]
There's one thing to stick it on there at night when everybody with a brain is either watching television getting laid or out doing something.

[01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:46.180]
But in the middle of the daytime here, when we have this gigantic signal and real living and breathing people listening, including all these Julios listening today,

[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:54.160]
and we got a stupid goddamn ball game on and even even though people from the public playing in it,

[01:35:55.260 --> 01:36:00.160]
they'd almost the biggest the automotive event of the year at Potampkin Toyota is $99 below invoice sale.

[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:03.980]
Leo Rogers got anyone can release a new movie.

[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:12.480]
But it takes a true Hollywood visionary to re-release a movie that's been seen at least 14 times by every man, woman, and child in the galaxy.

[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:17.020]
Star Wars. It's a fossil of us.

[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:24.920]
Star Wars. The same story. The same special effects. Plus a view that worked good enough to make it into the original.

[01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:26.480]
Dad, are those Muffins?

[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:50.360]
The same effect.

[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.860]
It makes it utterly indistinguishable from the original.

[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:55.200]
Call to the dog side.

[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:59.060]
Better yet, go to the bathroom.

[01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:00.300]
You have to see it.

[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:00.920]
Fifty-nine.

[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:04.120]
Star Wars. See it.

[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:06.500]
How about this, the life of the winners?

[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:12.100]
Okay, 12, 13 at 560 WDQM. Martin Sheen, actor, born as Ramon Estevez.

[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:15.260]
In. Are you ready for this? Born in Dayton, Ohio.

[01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:19.460]
Doesn't that make him Mexican?

[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:20.260]
Okay.

[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:24.760]
St. Sarromero and George gets one right.

[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:29.460]
Born in New York City, February 15th, 1907 of...

[01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:31.820]
... in parentage.

[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:35.780]
Pedro Armin Dadas. Born in Churabusco, Mexico.

[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:37.160]
Oh, here's a loopy Valese.

[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:40.500]
How about Puppy Campo? We got loopy Valese and Puppy Campo.

[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:42.400]
If they would get married, it would be Puppy and loopy.

[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.020]
Here's Burgess Meredith, died in 1997.

[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:46.700]
God, he was good.

[01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:50.140]
Played Jack Lemons, a Randy father and grumpy old men.

[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:53.260]
And it's superior sequel, Grumpy Old Men, in 1995.

[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.940]
Ah, they're all dying. The great ones are all dead.

[01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:00.080]
And what do we got left?

[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:02.400]
Here's a Cape Coral. Hello.

[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:04.220]
I got two for you.

[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:04.780]
Okay, sir.

[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:08.420]
The only Mexican that were banned from public television

[01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:13.480]
is the Frito Bandito in John Wayne's Lovely Wife.

[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:15.280]
Did you have a name?

[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:17.000]
I can't remember what a name was.

[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:18.220]
Well, somebody will call. Thank you, sir.

[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:20.360]
Somebody will call with John Wayne's Lovely Wife.

[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:22.060]
Maybe her name was Stay Wayne.

[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:25.840]
It's in La Caja Fall. You didn't see that.

[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:28.560]
Figures. Here's a plantation. Hello.

[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:30.800]
Hey. Yes, sir. How are you, Dale?

[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:32.280]
Great. We love you, sir.

[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:36.640]
Anyway, I've got two famous ex-Mexicans.

[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:39.040]
I believe senior wenches.

[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:41.720]
Dad, just died 103 years old.

[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:43.900]
One of your favorites. And my personal favorite.

[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:45.060]
Can't King's Wast.

[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:46.460]
Oh, yeah.

[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:47.560]
Remember that guy?

[01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:48.580]
Dental's brother.

[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:52.640]
And I don't know what his name was.

[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:54.440]
I think he meant that.

[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:56.400]
My name is Amin. It's Bill.

[01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:58.780]
Bill, uh, what was it?

[01:38:59.180 --> 01:38:59.580]
Bill Dana.

[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:02.920]
Right? It was, uh, was Bill Dana, Mexican?

[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:05.440]
My name was Amin.

[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:06.300]
I was born in the African-Lake one.

[01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:07.220]
Well, we'll find out.

[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:10.520]
And I thought one dead Batman guy.

[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.340]
Auto-Preminger.

[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:14.380]
Okay.

[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:15.420]
Mr. Freeze.

[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:18.200]
Auto-Preminger actually played in the movie?

[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:19.960]
No.

[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.180]
Auto-Preminger played on that character movie.

[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.460]
But on the TV show, was Auto-Preminger?

[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:26.720]
Was Mr. Freeze?

[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:28.780]
Okay. Whatever you say, and you're fading out.

[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:30.120]
And just in time, too.

[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:33.640]
56670560, 0560 on a mobile one line.

[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:36.120]
See, we get all confused here because there's the Batman.

[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.540]
There was the TV show and then the original movie's Batman,

[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:40.820]
which had the original cast, which were great.

[01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:43.320]
Then, of course, they perverted the whole thing and came along with these

[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:47.100]
Latter-day Batman movies, which just absolutely were grotesque, unacceptable,

[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:48.980]
and blasphemous if you asked me.

[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:52.640]
And I don't care who was in them, whether it was, uh, who was in them.

[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:55.060]
That horrible awful George Clooney.

[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:56.540]
I have no idea what his name was.

[01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:57.280]
He must have naked pictures.

[01:39:59.020 --> 01:39:59.820]
Michael Keaton.

[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:00.600]
Michael Keaton.

[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:02.520]
And then the Val Kilmer, he wasn't bad.

[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:03.240]
He was okay.

[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:04.060]
Huh?

[01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:05.340]
He was okay.

[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:05.940]
The movie stopped.

[01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:09.020]
No, he was in the one that had Jim Carey as the...

[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:09.100]
Right.

[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:09.920]
Yes.

[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.120]
And that was pretty good.

[01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:11.540]
Yeah.

[01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:12.600]
Batman Part 800.

[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:15.900]
But I mean, the whole concept of that, like I've said before, it's like Sherlock Holmes

[01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:19.340]
with people 100 years after a razzle bat-bone die.

[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:20.720]
I mean, it's just not the same.

[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:25.280]
It's like somebody else plays like, uh, what's his name, Peter Cushing,

[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:26.400]
playing Dracula?

[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:29.480]
Who is the other one to play Dracula?

[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:33.540]
Christopher, um, whatever the hell his name was.

[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:33.760]
Lee?

[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:35.060]
Was that who was?

[01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:36.380]
Chris Lee, Christopher Leibin.

[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:37.360]
I mean, that's...

[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.800]
There's only one Dracula baby.

[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:40.640]
Bella Logosi, that's the only one.

[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:42.180]
Because he was doing a good stuff.

[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:48.300]
You know something that lunches really making progress.

[01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:50.980]
But thing we got that Marlon game.

[01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:54.160]
Are we going to do the clock or we just, uh, yeah, I guess.

[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:55.500]
Huh?

[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:57.300]
Yeah, it doesn't really make any difference.

[01:40:57.300 --> 01:40:59.180]
I mean, when you come right down to it, I don't care.

[01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:01.020]
They can take it whenever they want.

[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:02.820]
The Boogster is out there at the ballpark right now.

[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:04.120]
They might do the pregame starting now.

[01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:04.780]
I don't care.

[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:06.640]
Dave O'Brien wants to come on to a half hour

[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:07.720]
and how the Marlon's really thinking.

[01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:08.520]
Nobody ought to go up there.

[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:09.480]
I think that's great.

[01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:13.080]
I respect the fact that Dave O'Brien is just not another suckle.

[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.560]
We got so many suckles in his town.

[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:17.140]
And there's that great piece on Dave in this morning's, uh,

[01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:17.960]
I think in the Sun Sentinel.

[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:20.460]
By Alan Snell, Nox Nell.

[01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:23.660]
Saying, hey, here's a guy that's not going to, uh, you know,

[01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:25.640]
be another suckle for the High Pingo organization.

[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:28.300]
There's enough people working at organization already

[01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:29.640]
who are nothing but professional askuses.

[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:31.900]
You know, I'm talking about they start right.

[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:34.080]
We don't need anymore of those.

[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:35.480]
We need somebody who's going to say, hey, listen,

[01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:37.400]
this team is sticking to join out their 6-21.

[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:39.000]
They haven't won a game since before.

[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:42.200]
Fernando Valenzuela weighed 150 pounds 200 years ago.

[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:43.940]
So forget it.

[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:44.880]
Nice going, Dave.

[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:47.860]
Here's a mobile in North Miami Beach.

[01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:48.080]
Hello.

[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:52.060]
Mobile in North Miami Beach is gone.

[01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:56.340]
After 11 minutes and 54 seconds at our dime, shame on you.

[01:41:58.660 --> 01:41:59.920]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:00.160]
Hello.

[01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:01.560]
Hey, Nell, how you doing?

[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:02.060]
Okay, sir.

[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:03.420]
Enjoy your show.

[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:04.900]
George did a good job while you're gone.

[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:06.300]
How about Salina?

[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:07.060]
Wasn't she Mexican?

[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:08.240]
Yeah, somebody already hit on that.

[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:09.320]
She was in the beach.

[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:10.320]
She's in.

[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:10.600]
Right.

[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:11.420]
Okay.

[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:12.340]
Thank you.

[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:13.660]
That's me. Thanks, Mike.

[01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:14.220]
And you're welcome.

[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:17.840]
567-0560, pound 562, the animal mobile online.

[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:20.640]
So far, the, uh, the Taco Bell, uh, Chihuahua.

[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:23.640]
He's number one by a, uh, and then the Frito Bandito.

[01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:27.800]
In other words, people that aren't, uh, people creatures, dogs, animals, things that aren't for real.

[01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:30.320]
Those are the most popular Mexicans of all.

[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:32.260]
Anything that's not for real in the live and breathing.

[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:35.680]
Like even the Cisco kid.

[01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:37.520]
That was a good series, by the way.

[01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:38.620]
Cisco kid, anybody remember that?

[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:38.940]
No.

[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:39.580]
No, of course not.

[01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:40.220]
You're not old enough.

[01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:40.520]
You're not old enough.

[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:41.200]
You're not old, far like me.

[01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:42.820]
And like I said before, you missed a lot.

[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:47.420]
Of course, I'm going to miss a lot eventually, but nevertheless, what goes around comes around.

[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:50.620]
You missed a lot of, all the good stuff, all the great stuff on television with the early days of the day.

[01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:54.460]
Television, television now, in spite of what Tom Zickim might tell you, television today blows.

[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.060]
It sucks.

[01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:55.960]
It's garbage.

[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:56.840]
It's swell.

[01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:58.520]
It's trash.

[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:00.320]
It's pathetic.

[01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:01.660]
What?

[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:03.780]
I mean, it's not, it's not even debatable.

[01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:06.260]
I'll go along with that.

[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:10.800]
All the great Alcoa theater in studio one and the Steve Allen show.

[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:14.340]
And, I mean, then the Steve Allen tonight show, the first tonight show with, uh, what's his name?

[01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:14.820]
Who was it?

[01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:15.720]
Check part.

[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:16.760]
No, not check part.

[01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:17.420]
Get out of here.

[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:17.680]
See?

[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:19.320]
I'm going to have to go.

[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:19.820]
What are you talking about?

[01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:22.020]
The trouble, uh, what the hell was his name?

[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:27.820]
Did the first, uh, Jackie, uh, Jerry, uh, Jerry, uh, his name was Jerry Sumpin.

[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:29.800]
Patrick.

[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:30.840]
Probably some Jew.

[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:31.560]
Yeah.

[01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:32.860]
No, I don't think he was a Jew.

[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:33.900]
Jerry, what the hell was his name?

[01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:34.780]
He did the first tonight show.

[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.200]
And then Steve Allen was on the tonight show and it was really great.

[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:42.020]
And then Jack Par with, um, I had a gingled and Alexander, uh, whatever his name was, all that other, you're right.

[01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:42.560]
All Jews.

[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:45.200]
Jerry Lester.

[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:46.220]
That was his name.

[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:46.540]
You're right.

[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:47.840]
That must have been the Jew, Jerry Lester.

[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:55.600]
That's what television, what Milton Burl, Red Skeleton, I love loosely, with that, uh, Desi Arnez.

[01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:58.860]
Here's a mobile in Miami Lakes.

[01:43:58.980 --> 01:43:59.100]
Hello.

[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:03.520]
Mobile in Miami Lakes, another one, another deadhead.

[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:03.820]
Okay.

[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:05.220]
Here's the Coral Gables.

[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:05.460]
Hello.

[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:06.500]
Hey, Neil.

[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:07.060]
Yes, sir.

[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:09.240]
Got a couple of names and that's where Fiea mentioned.

[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:12.900]
Uh, John Wayne's wife, by the way, was Mexican her name was P. L.R.

[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:13.640]
P. L.R.

[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:15.160]
He's a Mexican.

[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:16.700]
Uh, he sounds like a character from guiding light.

[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:18.540]
Anyway, Racco Welch.

[01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:19.400]
He's Mexican?

[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:19.940]
Yes.

[01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:22.760]
Uh, it's a Tijuana San Diego thing.

[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:24.580]
I think her father was in the service room.

[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:25.880]
I'd like that.

[01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:26.240]
Okay.

[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:35.020]
And I, and I seem to recall seeing a documentary called Hidden Latins that Walt Disney of all people,

[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:40.320]
hiding it, some sort of Latin, but I don't, I don't want to spit it out.

[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:41.280]
He had a little Latin in him.

[01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:41.960]
Exactly.

[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:42.640]
Uh, huh.

[01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:44.620]
So that's a pretty big name.

[01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:45.340]
You're right.

[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:46.900]
Uh, George, show.

[01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:47.620]
Thank you, sir.

[01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:47.980]
Thanks.

[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:48.500]
God bless you.

[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:48.960]
Okay.

[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:52.060]
So in other words, even Disney World, maybe that's why there's so much perversion going on in the

[01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:52.760]
words of Disney people.

[01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:55.660]
Maybe there's this little Latin in them because you know those Latin, those hot-blooded

[01:44:55.660 --> 01:44:56.980]
Latin, they can't keep it in their pants.

[01:44:58.360 --> 01:44:59.240]
Oh, look at this.

[01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:01.140]
21 past the hour already.

[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:01.460]
I see.

[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:02.780]
I don't know what the clock story is.

[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:06.240]
So we better do the break now because I don't want to go like running into the ballgame and get everybody

[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:06.760]
all-sucker.

[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:07.360]
Oh, gee.

[01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:10.980]
That damn Roger thinks he's so important just because he's got a 12 share there in midday and

[01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:14.320]
then he's like, man, or whatever it is, that he's like going over in the ballgame.

[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:15.400]
I'm going to tell you something.

[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:18.680]
I don't want to want to put down the fact we got the Marlon Brewer game coming up in just a few

[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:20.060]
minutes, but they're going to old points.

[01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:20.740]
You know what I think it like?

[01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:21.380]
And what's they do?

[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:23.720]
If they could do the separate daily number for this afternoon?

[01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:28.660]
I guarantee you a booge right now in between bites of his four or five sandwiches.

[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:29.980]
I bet you're right as we speak.

[01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:32.120]
He's counting the house and we'll take it in about 30 seconds.

[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:32.600]
He'll be done.

[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:35.600]
1221 at 560.

[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:36.820]
WQ Anne Lorenz.

[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:37.020]
Hell.

[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:37.840]
It damn near.

[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:38.260]
Kill them.

[01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:41.260]
Bye.

[01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:45.940]

[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:49.420]
Next week.

[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.400]
My ain't it, my ain't it, my ain't it!

[01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:59.080]
My ain't it, my ain't it, my ain't it.

[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:01.860]
My ain't it, my ain't it, my ain't it!

[01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:04.880]
Hi kids, y'all like cutin' little stinkin'?

[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:07.420]
That funny little sound that comes right out your springtons.

[01:46:08.180 --> 01:46:10.700]
Wanna copy me in too exactly like I do?

[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:13.420]
Get Pato writein' little songs about boo-hoo,

[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:15.020]
My brain's all gone.

[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:16.620]
I'm trying to get my groove on,

[01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:19.360]
But I can't fit you out with spice girl, I'm gonna fart on.

[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:20.820]
Hey Dr. Dreass.

[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:22.000]
Yo, man, you bastard.

[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:23.160]
Hey, I'm not.

[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:24.440]
What do I smell ass?

[01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:25.540]
And you look wet.

[01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:28.240]
Well, since age 12, it seemed like I always smell like

[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:30.600]
hot-ripping gases in June, it was pretty swell.

[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:33.500]
I got pissed off when I took my jeans off,

[01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:35.900]
and farted so hard, each of my love goes backwards,

[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:36.660]
like crisscross.

[01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:40.120]
And every night, I'm like, oh, dinner has been torn out

[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:42.500]
my ass, fast and a fat, bitch, you ain't too fat.

[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:43.700]
Smell this honey.

[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:45.660]
Yo, it's too late to miss my girl, come on.

[01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:46.620]
Don't give a fuck.

[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:48.480]
God's happy to take the world out.

[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:49.780]
My ain't it.

[01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:51.200]
My ain't it.

[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:52.820]
My ain't it.

[01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:53.880]
Smell this.

[01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:55.580]
My ain't it.

[01:46:56.380 --> 01:46:56.980]
My ain't it.

[01:46:57.740 --> 01:46:58.580]
My ain't it.

[01:46:59.020 --> 01:46:59.340]
Smell this.

[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:02.140]
Why you can see you're wanting me kicked out back in

[01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:02.700]
June, you're high.

[01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:05.620]
Said the problem was, something proud of my ass and die.

[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:07.580]
I shot him in the face with my vapor.

[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.160]
The worst happened later when I covered his desk

[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:11.360]
with you's toilet paper.

[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:14.200]
Walked in the stress club, my tests will filled up.

[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:16.600]
Moons of bartenders took a dump and a tip,

[01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:19.940]
because went over to a dad to head a fucking agarcer.

[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:22.900]
She lifted a leg up, and I knew she was a father.

[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:25.920]
Nine and nine sent him my life, I was lied to.

[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:28.840]
I just found out my mom got all cats and I do.

[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:29.380]
My baby.

[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:31.620]
I told her I broke up to be a famous rapper.

[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:33.340]
They were wrecked about strange noise.

[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:34.720]
They'd over-crap her.

[01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:37.480]
You know you was dirt when the women rushed to leave.

[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:40.300]
You'd drive the whole back, but you butt, you didn't release.

[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:43.380]
The sky and white cat and said it was pretty cool.

[01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:46.700]
But I had to go, go drop the keys off and move.

[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:51.780]
My anus, my anus, my anus, melt.

[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:57.620]
My anus, my anus, my anus, melt.

[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:03.520]
My anus, my anus, melt.

[01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:06.840]
Yeah, that's how I settled yesterday.

[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:08.180]
I'd rather smile your back.

[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:09.440]
You could feed any day of the week.

[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:10.460]
Well, we could talk.

[01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:14.180]
1228 is 560 WQAM.

[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:17.060]
And you know we're all done here basically and I didn't have time to get to the most

[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:18.080]
important story of the day.

[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:22.580]
Minister guilty of sexual growth and you have to must pay woman $116,800.

[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:24.820]
You see this?

[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:29.320]
Father Connie, Reverend Connie, so-stricken.

[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:32.000]
Never trust a guy named Connie, even Connie Mack, okay?

[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:33.820]
We'll save that for tomorrow.

[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:34.660]
Heavy duty stuff.

[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:37.000]
Okay, let's do Miami real fast.

[01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:37.340]
Hello?

[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:39.240]
Miami?

[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:40.560]
Hello?

[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:41.260]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:43.380]
Yes, I'm calling a lot of Star Wars.

[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:44.320]
Yeah.

[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:48.900]
And I want to just say that Star Wars is different from Star Trek because it's more like a regular

[01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:53.540]
movie with people and it's just set in space where Star Trek is worth.

[01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:55.820]
It was real people like Obi-Wan Kenobi people like that.

[01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:57.400]
Well, I'm saying Darth Vader.

[01:48:57.420 --> 01:49:00.460]
Newman with regular character, good versus evil.

[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:04.720]
We're going to say not Star Trek where it's just a search for aliens.

[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:07.760]
Search for a life for Bill Chatman.

[01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:08.740]
I don't know where he is.

[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:09.300]
Mr. Spock.

[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:11.680]
Search for ears from Mr. Spock to replace those bad ones.

[01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:14.940]
I mean, if you compare it to I just feel like Star Wars is better.

[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:15.380]
That's just amazing.

[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:16.260]
I'll go along with that.

[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:16.720]
Thank you, sir.

[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:19.840]
God bless you and that damn little of what's in there.

[01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:20.440]
He's not in the movie.

[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:22.680]
Oh, no.

[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:23.660]
Thank God.

[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:24.620]
Not because-

[01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:26.440]
That damn fact, I can't stand him.

[01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:28.140]
So that's going to do what you mean to say.

[01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:31.100]
We got to get out of here for the ball game and I'm like, oh, Jesus Christ.

[01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:37.460]
The Neil Roger show on 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale.
