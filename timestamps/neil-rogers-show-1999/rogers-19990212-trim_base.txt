[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]
Sports Radio 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.400]
You're talking Neil called 567-0560 toll free for date and brarror.

[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.760]
Or count 560 on yourself both.

[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.880]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show do not necessarily reflect

[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.340]
those of WQAM easily read acquisitions or the Beasley Broadcast Group.

[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.620]
Now Neil Rogers on Sports Radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.300]
It's Friday you first news.

[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.800]
Looks like a guy.

[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.540]
She said she's 17 wide.

[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.300]
She makes me want to touch rice.

[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.900]
She said she's a fat, a stiff with a dick.

[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.860]
She's with a dick with two smelly chins.

[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.840]
She's slowly chins, uploaded and ugly fat dick.

[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.000]
She wants a lady to stop with you things.

[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.560]
And Rhythmi Lauren asks it's on like this.

[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.620]
But we find that amusing from that self-promoting ugly face.

[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.340]
How much were you saying?

[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.680]
Formatica's saying.

[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.900]
I richer seen the lens.

[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.660]
The tricks are fast.

[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.700]
I wake you up with reading a low hand.

[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.920]
I'll guess I guess it wouldn't be worth it.

[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.520]
I'm a human being, and it's like you're about so far away.

[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.280]
Just really you see your clean.

[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.600]
You've had a pocket of ugly smelly dick.

[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.160]
You're really not touching a thread.

[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.780]
Oh no.

[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.540]
It's a big tip of that thing.

[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.500]
It's kind of 1550 WQM happy Friday.

[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.760]
Today's the big day, baby.

[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.100]
It's going to have a party today.

[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.880]
We're going to have a Post-Peniscate party right here on a year today,

[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.840]
because in just next 90 minutes it's going to be all over.

[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.040]
One of those right-wing lunatics, all those Clinton vashes,

[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.700]
those bubble vashes going to be doing.

[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.420]
Well this just doesn't sound right at all.

[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.900]
You know what?

[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.600]
I'm not going to get started on that.

[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.020]
They do have their DCS upstairs.

[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.860]
They got their DSS, whatever it is.

[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.000]
They're damn dish.

[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.460]
They got a dish upstairs.

[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.760]
The only problem is the fish in a box.

[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.660]
It's still sitting on the floor in a box.

[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.000]
Oh, I wonder if it's milky or flasher.

[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.540]
But anyway, you know, Boog must be doing something right,

[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.080]
because he sure gets a lot of heatpacks as I'll tell you.

[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.380]
So I'm going to tell you something, boys and girls,

[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.480]
here's a little secret for you.

[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.080]
If you're just an ass kisser and you're not pissing anybody off,

[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.020]
you're probably pretty boring.

[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.240]
But if you're like somebody that's getting people ticked off on it,

[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.700]
then you must be doing something right,

[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.920]
even if you are real fat.

[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.480]
Boog inspired me to do a one of our quick mini-poles here this morning,

[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.080]
like we did yesterday.

[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.360]
Maybe we'll do that every day.

[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.200]
Yeah, okay, it inspired some good stuff.

[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.140]
For the fatist and ugliest here at QAIM,

[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.540]
which we've got a lot of candidates, me,

[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.220]
I'm right there near the front, but I got news for them.

[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.560]
I'm not even close to being the fatist.

[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.560]
Not even close.

[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.500]
And Joe, you're full of crap by the way.

[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.780]
You didn't just see me sitting down.

[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.560]
I was standing up and you know, God damn it.

[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.960]
You just suck an ass again, Joe.

[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.640]
You know, say something, fathead.

[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.920]
And we know Steele's got the fatest head.

[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.080]
But we're not, he's not a candidate for the fatist and ugliest on the station.

[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.380]
I mean, we got the will to beast,

[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.800]
which the people of the audience have never seen that.

[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.760]
And believe me, and then we got fat boy,

[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.020]
who is the whole man.

[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.280]
I'm telling you, at least one, you got to be more specific.

[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.580]
Why? You can't use that nickname for it.

[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.100]
So Jeff is known as fat boy.

[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.340]
That's his name. That's his non-deplume.

[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.120]
And don't give him no plume because he might eat it.

[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.820]
By the way, Tracy, and that we're not talking about Tracy Caroseto or our own Tracy,

[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.340]
we're talking about Tracy DeCronik Factor.

[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.260]
Yesterday, in the day before with Tracy Foster,

[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.460]
today is Joey, who hates booge-like poison,

[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.700]
and says, stop sucking everybody's ass, booge.

[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.440]
Then here's Peter, who says, you're a fat piece of, um, the booge.

[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.920]
And he also mentions that Pat Riley,

[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.480]
I didn't hear what Booge said about Pat Riley,

[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.440]
or listen to the station, but Pat Riley does listen to the show, by the way.

[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.580]
I'm going to tell you something. Pat Riley,

[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.320]
now that Doug McLean is long gone out of town,

[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.780]
he's the only coach of a professional team in his town who admits,

[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.400]
who are listening to this show.

[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.020]
So even though I hate the NBA, I can't stand Mickey Ererson.

[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.740]
I don't go for the grease down here, look,

[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.800]
but Pat Riley is a good guy with a sense of humor.

[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.060]
Because he listens to this show and admits it.

[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.440]
How do you like that? I like it.

[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.460]
I've gone there, Pat, you're a good guy, okay?

[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.480]
Get into a real sports someday. Maybe be a good hockey coach.

[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.200]
How about those Panthers? Any interest? No.

[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.200]
Beatin Red Hot Ottawa 3, one up there last night,

[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.140]
and that big black guy named Peter gets another goal.

[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.380]
Any interest? No. Okay, we won't talk about that. No more.

[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.280]
Sorry. Just thought I'd mention that.

[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.420]
Okay, there's our mini pool for the day,

[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.060]
who is the fattest and ugliest now? Let's see, who are all the candidates?

[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.480]
God, there's so many. Well, you see,

[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.600]
it's not fair because the audience doesn't know all these people.

[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.300]
And I got news for it. I would be surprised when he comes back

[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.980]
from his eating vacation if Vivo is a candidate.

[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.200]
Seriously, I think that after they got done with Vogue

[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.260]
with the bicycle pump, hopefully they washed it off first

[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.760]
because there's a lot of that typhoon going around.

[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.980]
They washed off the tube and stuck it in D-fo's rectum,

[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.620]
like pumped him up a little bit. See, when Arnold talks about pumping it up,

[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.080]
I don't think that's what he had in mind.

[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.580]
Or when one of those lymph-a-1 spots we have on the station,

[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.500]
when they talk about pumping up your... I don't think that's what they had in mind either.

[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.700]
Because D-fo, maybe he's in training for it.

[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.580]
Maybe he's sitting at a buffet right now as we speak some,

[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.940]
or in training for the fat off. That would be a good contest.

[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.360]
Of course, that would be some promotion. It would be kind of funny.

[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.780]
It would be very funny and amusing. Isn't that a great idea for promotion?

[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.600]
There you go, Sam. Sam, are you listening? No.

[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.000]
You got any interest? No.

[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.340]
That would be a tremendous promotion, the fattest slob at QIM,

[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.620]
which I would gladly participate, Hank is certainly in the running.

[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.380]
Although, I guess he lost... I haven't seen Hank in months.

[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.300]
And since he had that real, real scare here a couple of months ago,

[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.700]
he lost, what do you say? A couple of ounces. Oh, he lost some weight.

[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.500]
Although, even if he lost some weight, I wouldn't be surprised if...

[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.740]
If he's still in the running. That was... Yeah, he's still in the running.

[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.300]
And we got fat boy upstairs, we got the wildebeest, we got the schmogrippin.

[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.480]
Of course, he's not on QIM, but he's in the same family.

[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.020]
Josh, ready? Oh, no, jeez.

[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.980]
I was trying so hard to forget. Engineer Julio.

[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.740]
He's not that... He's fat, yeah, you're right, he's pretty fat, but not like Josh Friedman.

[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.040]
In fact, I think the finalist already is Josh Friedman at the wildebeest and the fattboy, Jeff Fye.

[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.380]
Those are the finalists.

[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.980]
I mean, if you could see the three... In vision, the three of them...

[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.560]
What? What length down the hall together? Jesus Christ!

[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.060]
As flimsy as this building is constructed, just in vision, the three of them

[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.260]
and one of those elevators down the hall together.

[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.860]
Oh my God, because these elevators break down if there's like a butterfly gets on there.

[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.040]
Like some of the people from Power 96, like if a butterfly gets on there, the elevator breaks down.

[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.940]
But with the three of them on it together, no chance.

[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.280]
So that's something you might think about with your sarcastic tongues this morning.

[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.820]
I sure hope that lady calls in today because God, I'm in a great mood.

[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.420]
I'm almost over my rash. I'm feeling a lot better, but like the doctor said, it takes time.

[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.100]
It's going, it's going, it's going, it's going already, but it's a myth.

[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.520]
Thank God for that.

[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.580]
Anybody out there going to be flying American Airlines anytime soon?

[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:49.840]
No.

[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.000]
I just want to say this, okay, American Airlines, you suck.

[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.140]
That's what I want to say.

[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.580]
And not that it didn't interrupt any of my plan because I do fly American once in a while.

[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.180]
Once in a great while, I have one of their advantage ear-mile things, you know.

[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.160]
But I'm a very rarely fly American.

[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.060]
Quite far like I've said before, I've been fear.

[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.860]
American Airlines has got the best food of any of the domestic carriers by far.

[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.120]
They really have some good food.

[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.300]
It's just that you can't get out of God damn plane. That's the problem because their pilots are assholes.

[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.020]
And even though that judge said go back to work, they said, no, we don't think so.

[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:21.780]
We're still sick today.

[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:30.820]
And they, you know, half a million passengers just at LaGuardia the last seven days have been all screwed up just in one airport.

[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:40.580]
So you can imagine nationwide how many thousands and thousands and thousands of flights and how many millions of passengers have been screwed up.

[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:47.280]
And you know, I don't know about you, but I think by now you know me well enough to know that my vacations are pretty goddamn important to me.

[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.560]
Like all 85 vacations every year.

[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:55.700]
And if you've only got a few days vacation and you've got like, you know, some kind of a trip plan, do wherever you're going.

[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.500]
You're going to Hawaii, you're going to Vegas, you got a ski trip to Aspen or a barbie going.

[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.600]
And then along comes these pilots and screw up your life and I blame American.

[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.380]
I don't blame the pilots. I blame the airline.

[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:15.120]
They should do whatever it takes, whatever it takes to settle that because I got news for I could be wrong.

[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:21.000]
But if my vacation or my life was like totally disrupted and of course this is a three day holiday weekend.

[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.740]
It's one of those bogus presidents, the holidays. If my whole deal was disrupted.

[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:30.140]
No matter whose fault it was, I would still blame the airline and I would say American you suck.

[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.380]
I will never fly you again.

[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.620]
And even though they didn't disrupt any of my travel plans and I'm not going to be flying them anytime soon.

[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:41.920]
Then I know I still probably won't be flying them because I don't trust the ambiance of the way they do business.

[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:49.620]
They don't care enough about their customers to do whatever would have taken to get the pilot satisfied and get them back and do something.

[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.880]
Whatever the hell it took to get them back to work.

[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.820]
See I've been really lucky all the traveling that I do over the years.

[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.780]
I mean I have been really lucky.

[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:05.360]
The only time I can think about a long delay was that one time in Amsterdam we get to the airport to skip all airport names.

[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.400]
Did I'm coming back home?

[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:12.120]
We go to the check-in counter and they say are you aware that the flight is leaving four hours late instead of 10.30 at 230?

[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.680]
And I thought oh Jesus.

[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:19.180]
And then I realized there's the Harlem casino inside. There's a little casino inside the airport and I'm still not.

[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.520]
You know this story.

[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.620]
And we go in there for five minutes. They got about 40-50 slot machines.

[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.020]
You know it's a little dinky casino. I go in there and play for like four or five minutes and they're dinging the name.

[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.960]
The bells are ringing at 960 bucks.

[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.700]
Which quite frankly I don't know about you but a thousand dollars in you know four hours it was worth a year of stay.

[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.740]
That's been my only like major inconvenience.

[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.640]
I've had other things with you know malfunctions and minor delays an hour here or there.

[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.900]
But I've never had one of those deals so I don't think I could cope with it.

[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:51.080]
You know you see those people have been sitting in the airport for like a day and a half and two days they're just sitting there on their luggage.

[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.920]
Would like to look at death on their post.

[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:53.760]
I couldn't deal with it.

[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.400]
I think I might just snap a little bit.

[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.220]
10 minutes after 10 and 560 WQA.

[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.760]
This is a bunch of hooy.

[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.400]
Oh, there's an awesome trouble for you.

[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.240]
That's just now look what you're doing.

[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.220]
Oh, best of luck with the same dress.

[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.620]
Best dress, best dress, best dress, best dress, best dress, best dress.

[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.300]
Oh, oh!

[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.380]
Best dress, best dress, best dress, best dress, best dress, best dress, best dress, best dress.

[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.000]
Yeah, it gets fine, gets worse, worse come.

[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.200]
She's saving the dress like a low-loved skull.

[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.340]
It's best like two, two, where's the periphera hat?

[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.840]
Where's the size 14, she's got, she's so got this back.

[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.840]
Not but she's at pretty, she's my bad brat but she's in some of my playing just the way I like.

[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.840]
Best of the kind of fencingσ�

[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.340]
All now without my design

[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.600]
Best of scenes.

[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.120]
Em, best of scenes.

[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.460]
Best of scenes, best of scenes being kids.

[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:15.940]
Best of scenes being kids, best dress being, best dress being kids.

[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.820]
Best of scenes layions with this tango

[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:16.820]

[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.440]
and Monica Gate and Linda Tripgate stuff today.

[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.000]
And maybe after the day, we don't have to be planning no more.

[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.420]
All Monica Corses, I mean Linda Trip, she's making the rounds.

[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.240]
She's all over the goddamn TV if you have a big screen.

[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.100]
In fact, she ought to be in the contest too, by the way. Big fat cow Linda Trip.

[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.680]
So at any rate, the votes are going to be between about 11 and 11.

[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.920]
30 because they're behind closed doors one more time,

[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.540]
because I think there were three more senators right?

[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.220]
You know, just go through the formality of it.

[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.180]
And we'll put it on there, baby.

[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.620]
We'll open up that pot from CNN and we'll be able to hear.

[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.340]
I don't hear it.

[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.080]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:53.720]
I and, you know, I and maybe one of them will say,

[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.880]
I could be and then we'll get it over with.

[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.780]
And then all those bubble backs.

[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.260]
You're out there.

[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.580]
They'll have to find something else to do.

[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.700]
Oh, by the way, speaking of maybe they didn't play with their little telepubbi.

[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.780]
Because I come in this morning and what's sitting here for me on the counter.

[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.360]
Nice going there, George. Wow.

[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.060]
This is one of the most precious things I've ever received in my life.

[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.080]
My very own tinky winky.

[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.020]
I've always wanted a tinky winky, you know?

[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.520]
And here's my purple tinky winky in a box.

[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.780]
And quite frankly, it looks like something for my favorite martian is what it looks like.

[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.680]
It's out of this world.

[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.360]
It's like a purple little stupid thing is what it is.

[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.080]
And I don't see anything gay about it or straight or I don't think it's anything

[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:32.960]
do sexual about it.

[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.620]
In fact, it looks like rather smooth down there.

[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.140]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.520]
Yes, they're all very smooth.

[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.760]
Right, kind of like our promotions director.

[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.340]
Very smooth.

[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.880]
Yes, an old smoothie.

[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.580]
Oh, God.

[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.140]
And then we got the Mandage story.

[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.820]
Got so much stuff going on here today.

[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.160]
Tom Zicker writes in the sports section, though,

[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.300]
as TV radio writer.

[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.740]
Oh, TV radio writer.

[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.960]
Nice story about the radio ratings, by the way.

[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.280]
The last two books, Tom.

[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:01.840]
He just was busy, you know?

[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.640]
Mandage fired from TV post.

[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.060]
And now this is really old news.

[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.420]
But for some strange reason, it shows up both in very jackasses column today.

[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.640]
And also in the Tom Zicker writes in the sports section, the Sun Sandwell.

[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.360]
Jim Mendic has been cut.

[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:20.260]
It says WPLG channel 10 is told the former golf intern broadcaster that he no longer

[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:25.300]
will be the station's weekend sports anchor when his contract expires on April 17th.

[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.800]
I think what put him over the edge was even walked up to the GN there and asked him,

[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.020]
were you fudge back him?

[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.640]
Does this mean he's been fired as Mandage would say?

[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:33.180]
Yeah.

[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.340]
Yeah, that's what it says.

[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.820]
Yes, would like 10 S's, you know?

[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.860]
So a little Tommy Jicke, a little my good friend who's bald and stupid and don't listen to show.

[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.500]
He must be listening.

[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.820]
Don't put any spins on this to colorfully blunt mandat said that's what happened.

[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.860]
He got canned, axed, fired.

[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.100]
Mandat said he was called in the news director bill.

[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:55.680]
Paul Hobie's office a couple of weeks ago and was handed letter from the general manager, John Garwood.

[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.880]
It informed him that his contract would not be extended.

[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:03.740]
I read it then, but ask me if I had any questions, Mandat said there is much to ask when you'd been just told.

[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.440]
You've been fired.

[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.980]
The reason cited, Mandage said was his inflexibility in accepting assignments.

[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:17.340]
The former University of Michigan, all America runs a construction company and is available for broadcast work only on weekends except in special circumstances.

[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:27.620]
The outspoken Mandage, who also host sports talk programs on WKYM 560 AM, has been a presence on WPLG off and on since 1986.

[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.420]
He has anchored the weekend sports reports for the past two years.

[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:31.500]
Right?

[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:31.980]
Yes!

[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.160]
He said he leaves with no hard feelings.

[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.460]
In fact, he's hoping that he might be able to prolong his association with Channel 10 in a limited form.

[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:45.480]
I suppose I might try to continue with sports, jam live, the locally produced program that precedes Monday Night Football during the fall, he said.

[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.980]
Paul Hobie declined to be specific, but offered the likelihood that Mandage will be asked to continue contributing to WPLG.

[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:56.860]
Even after Mandage's contract expires, Paul, he said, Jim Mandage will be a valuable part of eyewitness sports.

[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.400]
Mandage will also continue to serve as the color commentator at the office of radio network.

[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.740]
See what some people are realized.

[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:10.720]
In fact, some of the people in this building are very lucky that Mandage is prime source of income, is from his construction company, which restricts the amount of time that he can be on the air.

[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:16.620]
Because if he did have a more flexible schedule, I guarantee you would be hearing a lot more of Jim Mandage on this radio station.

[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:16.840]
Yeah!

[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.560]
Like on a very, very regular basis.

[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:18.860]
Yeah!

[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.460]
Like I mean, many, many hours a week.

[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:20.740]
Yeah!

[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.780]
But he's great.

[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.480]
Don't be knocking Jim Mandage to me like I've told him many times before.

[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.800]
He's not just another dumb F-jock.

[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:28.720]
He's an entertainer.

[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:29.200]
He's amusing.

[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.180]
He's hysterical.

[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.780]
He's a panic.

[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:32.880]
Am I right?

[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.700]
I'm son of a bitch.

[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:35.240]
Exactly.

[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:37.560]
So there you go.

[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.360]
No more Mandage on Channel 10, at least for a while.

[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.160]
Then somebody I think always casino stands so I don't thank him so much.

[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:50.000]
Send me the article from Tuesday, which somehow I missed it about the Swinclubs bust in the Broward County.

[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.180]
Can Jenny's psychosis and the pleasure police?

[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.400]
I'd actually seen this in print.

[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.840]
A veteran Fort Lauderdale police officer in a Broward Sheriff's Office corrections officer,

[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.960]
among 24 people arrested and charged, would loot and lascivious behave your early Sunday morning during a raid

[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.480]
at a Swinger's Club near Tamarack.

[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.800]
Sheriff's deputies raided the Trappies International Club 3660 West commercial boulevard just after midnight Sunday.

[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:17.140]
They found more than 100 people inside the club, but arrested only those who were involved in sexual acts.

[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:17.540]
Oh my God.

[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.760]
Said major Gary Moore.

[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.620]
I thought Gary Moore a bit the big one.

[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:30.040]
Head of the Sheriff's Office Strategic Investigations Division undercover officers from that division have been stocking out the club after receiving anonymous complaints from neighbors more said.

[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.580]
We're not in a business of promoting morality here.

[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.800]
He said just in the business of promoting state statutes.

[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.260]
If there are other of these establishments around the country that are doing similar act, they may have a problem with the Florida state statutes around the county.

[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.380]
Along with that, well, but I'm not going to read the names.

[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.760]
And why they're in the paper. I have no idea.

[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.140]
One is a Fort Lauderdale police officer. One is a BSO corrections officer.

[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:59.900]
One is a corrections officer with Broward, a civilian employee with Oakland Park Police, and it's said to have been so on.

[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:07.240]
Sheriff's deputies and the club owners Dennis Friedland and Alan Maasda, both of both of them were also arrested.

[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.780]
Those arrested were charged with second degree misdemeanors.

[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:17.460]
Sheriff's deputies made a similar bus three weeks ago when a famous forum near Pomano Beach was rated and 31 people arrested and charged with loot and lascivious behavior.

[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.580]
Again, I know we had no very response to this.

[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.840]
At least not on the year because everybody's terrified to talk about it on the year.

[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.320]
Unless their voices be recognized.

[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.700]
These are private clubs.

[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:32.080]
Let me say it for the 500th time where people pay a dues to join.

[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.080]
They pay a very hefty amount to show up every week whenever they show up.

[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.440]
Nobody is dragged enough to street.

[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:42.300]
There's nothing overt going on like out in the front steps out in the parking lot.

[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:47.360]
There are no hookers hanging around because nobody needs any hookers in this place because anybody is getting any hits on the inside.

[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:53.180]
But oh no, we can't have that because Ken Jennings got higher political aspirations.

[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.820]
That's what that's all about.

[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.760]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.060]
Good morning.

[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:00.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.600]
The two fat candidates. First of all, Marlon Brando or Dave Deans?

[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:05.760]
Dave what?

[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.500]
Dave Deans.

[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.360]
Yeah, Deans.

[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.800]
Are they doing Deans?

[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.040]
Yeah, he's a pretty gay man.

[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.120]
Yeah, I don't think I wanted to call you about.

[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.880]
I was a friend of mine that made me an email and he sent me a couple of antigrams.

[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.500]
And the first one was evangelist.

[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.260]
And if you take the letters from evangelist, you can get the word evils agent.

[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.800]
Those problems, neurologists, Christian Neurolus out there.

[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.380]
Ironically enough also, if you take the words President Clinton of the US, you get.

[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.480]
And you rearrange letters, you can get to calculate, you find interns.

[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.960]
So it's kind of ironic.

[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.480]
Yeah. Never really give it much thought, but I guess you're right.

[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.180]
Now, I was just doing our how they take 666, etc.

[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.580]
I thought it was funny evangelist with evils agent.

[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.020]
Yeah.

[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:49.840]
Anyway.

[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.840]
I think most evangelists take it the wrong way.

[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:52.600]
Like, back bone.

[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:52.800]
Yeah.

[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.120]
You have a good morning.

[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.580]
Yeah. Have a great day.

[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.500]
Okay, we got one call on the board here today.

[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:03.360]
I think maybe we'll just play the medley of all the penis-gate stuff until we get ready to put the thing on the ear from Scott.

[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:03.580]
Yeah.

[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:07.860]
And 56670560, 0560 on the mobile one line.

[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.860]
I guess nobody here flies American.

[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.140]
Nobody hears the head any of those bad experiences.

[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:20.020]
Nobody here has fired up and pissed off about that because probably all the people that are having the problems are sitting there in a goddamn airport at MIA with a real sour and nasty look on their puts.

[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.880]
Here's a mobile in South Miami.

[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:23.220]
Hello.

[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.600]
Good morning.

[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:25.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:33.740]
What's the need of helps in the game last night and I cannot believe Robert said it won't you say like three of four times calling on.

[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.520]
What else?

[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.040]
Thank you.

[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.180]
Okay, whatever you say is a sniper and you're getting the phone.

[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.880]
Okay, that takes care of our calls for today.

[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.300]
Oh, takes care of that.

[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.660]
I think what we need to do is move these a breaks up a little bit anyway.

[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:45.640]
Huh?

[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.860]
Also, we have plenty of time between 11 and 11.30.

[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.960]
In fact, let's just jam them all together and then we can sound like the worst team in the morning.

[00:20:51.960 --> 00:21:04.420]
Evidently, there's a lot of people really bitterly complaining and screaming and carrying on about the format on the worst team, which I guess is getting worse and worse than ever before with nine minutes of commercials and three minutes of sports updates and basically no show.

[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.140]
I mean, no show is a sports term.

[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:14.240]
But the worst team is being fourth and don't blame them for don't blame the guys on the show that again is the formatics of the station ourselves department and our management.

[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:26.720]
And people are like turning off and doing evil things to their radio and getting really fired up and pissed off because the breaks are much too long and there's like you can't even find the guys that are on the show anymore in between the sea of spots.

[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:31.720]
What we got to pay way and you know 1025 at 560 WQM.

[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:32.800]
I bet this is you have to stop.

[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:38.680]
I'm not.

[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.940]
She wasn't in time for the president.

[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.620]
Early on she wasn't sure what it meant, but he would show her.

[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.260]
Oh, right.

[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.740]
She should show her.

[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.700]
He took her on a tour of the evil place.

[00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.420]
And when they were through, we held a bioface and he said no.

[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.420]
Okay.

[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.400]
And when it came, he had it in his head.

[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.060]
She said really well.

[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.720]
I'm going to take the stand.

[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.680]
I'm not the world's most curious man, but for what I hear.

[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.780]
I understand she wants to go.

[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:15.840]
Here.

[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.080]
Go, go, go, go.

[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.200]
Go, go, go, go.

[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.460]
Oh, wow.

[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:44.160]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:49.620]
1031 at 560 WQM boy, you can feel the people sweating right now.

[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:49.980]
Can't you?

[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:50.800]
They're sweating bullets.

[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.460]
It's less than an hour now.

[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.520]
They're going to be voting probably in about a half an hour.

[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.780]
And they're going to be going no and no and no like that.

[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.160]
50, 60 million dollars at least flushed right down the toilet tax pair money.

[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.480]
People are starving.

[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.300]
People are freezing to death on the streets of America, North.

[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:23.000]
50 to 60 million though we could find for this escape because we're supposed to be all duly outraged at this unacceptable behavior because the president got a few blow jobs and wanted to cover it up.

[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:29.680]
And after spending all of that money, his political enemies have been after him since the day he got an office the first time.

[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.200]
Couldn't find anything else.

[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.080]
Couldn't nail them on anything of substance.

[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.700]
So they found a substance on address.

[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.100]
And that's what they went after.

[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.560]
That was the only substance they could come up with.

[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.880]
And we've been dragged through all this sanctimonious hypocrisy.

[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.180]
All this.

[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.720]
And of course we don't want to insult the house managers.

[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:56.920]
What is that about?

[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:57.720]
Have you heard that comment?

[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.420]
We don't want to insult the house manager.

[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.460]
We can feel like it was wasted their time under which hunt.

[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.880]
I mean if you're going to get a lynch mob together, at least make them feel like it was worthwhile.

[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:07.260]
Right?

[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.080]
Yeah.

[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.480]
Thank God.

[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.360]
Thank God.

[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.500]
If this is going to be over-with, then they're going to try for the censure thing which is not going to be a failure.

[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.060]
And that's going to fail.

[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.580]
And then that'll be it.

[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:24.540]
We can have a big celebration, a big president-state celebration appropriately enough over the weekend and move on with life.

[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.560]
And the TV network will all have to find something new and exciting to deal with.

[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.040]
Here's a mobile in Homestead.

[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:32.280]
Hello.

[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.480]
Neil God.

[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.020]
Yes.

[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:34.820]
Hey Neil.

[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.080]
Speaking of American Airlines.

[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.340]
That garbage in the air.

[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:43.640]
I had a business trip up to Atlanta Monday.

[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.040]
And stuck in Miami by the way.

[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.480]
I showed Monday my flight set eight show by said let me show below early show by six.

[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.140]
The line must be 40 deep.

[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.240]
There's two purchasing agents that's it.

[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.200]
Everyone else just coming around and screaming at the flight.

[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:00.880]
I canceled.

[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:01.340]
Yeah.

[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.600]
Go to somebody in charge.

[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.420]
You might not opening up to another person else.

[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.620]
I need to have to catch a flight.

[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.400]
Oh, sir, that's all we have right now.

[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.940]
We're taking care of the people from yesterday.

[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.260]
Isn't that just great?

[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:12.660]
Yeah.

[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.080]
What about the people from today?

[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:14.420]

[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.260]
Okay, we'll get to you as soon as possible.

[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.880]
Well, that's not as bad as coming back from Atlanta.

[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.320]
Now, that was murder.

[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.040]
I don't know if you've ever been to Atlanta.

[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.020]
Many, many times.

[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:24.280]

[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.480]
See, that's not...

[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.660]
I mean, not marriage place.

[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:27.040]

[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.120]
The airport is a living nightmare.

[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:35.120]
Oh, God, that's just, you know, I just wanted to get an historic story of a American Airlines that garbage in the sky.

[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:42.600]
Okay, you have a very good time. Thank you. Okay. We have an open line of Brown, all three and they five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on a mobile one line

[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.320]
Last call to the day. Here's a mobile and bouquet. Hello

[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:54.260]
Mobile and bokeh hello nioh. Yes, it's one of the car. I love your show. Let's see every day

[00:26:54.980 --> 00:27:02.840]
Keep doing what you're doing. Don't listen to those those Christian idiots. Yeah, and I call quiet and asshole

[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:13.020]
Okay, well, well, well, well, you know yesterday we really had him fired up and pissed off and foaming at the mouth and the little me like a schmuck that I usually am a

[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:17.420]
Committer-day assuming that today is such a momentous day in the history of our goddamn lives

[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:22.480]
I thought these people would be just overflowing with stuff. Are they no they got nothing, baby

[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.940]
They got absolutely positively nothing. They don't care about American Airlines

[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.420]
They don't care about penis gate coming to an end. They don't care about anything

[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.180]
You name it they can be oblivious to it

[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.420]
Five sit here's our last call our last

[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.920]
Feeler, okay, even that bitch that call yesterday twice not once

[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:45.700]
That was so incensed over the fact that I'm on the air whatever she was upset. I still don't know what she was upset about

[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:53.420]
Which I invited I extended a special personal invitation for her to call back. Did she call yet? No five six seven oh five sixty

[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:58.080]
Tom five sixty. Seriously you folks are the slowest starters. I have ever seen in my life

[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:04.100]
I've worked on what about a half a dozen stations in this market all these years and the people maybe it said that crossover thing

[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:10.180]
Maybe there's a much greater changing of the guard on this station than on IOD or wherever else

[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:13.620]
But I mean it's just unbelievable you have to kick him into the seat of the pants

[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:17.080]
You have to browbeat and you have to stick a big sharp poker up there

[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.380]
I can't just twist it and turn it in product

[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.420]
To get any kind of movement out of these people

[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.120]
Man

[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.360]
Here's Miami hello

[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.480]
Yes, sir. I've been American and Dallas. Is that a wonderful airport to go to?

[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.240]
That's another piece of crap where you can walk by the way about 500 miles between gates

[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.040]
How about Moses to get to Israel

[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.940]
Facing that's that thing that takes you outside by the way the shuttle they have

[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:45.160]
American and Dallas one time we're going to one of our Vegas excursions and

[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.960]
You know you're on that thing and you're it's like being a Disney World

[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:53.140]
It's like you're going around the whole county before you get back inside the airport

[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:58.520]
Like wreck is like one or two of the worst places to go ever. Yeah, you're right

[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.060]
Take care to have a week guys and back to you, sir

[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.120]
Yeah, I think we're gonna take a survey on this is there a worse airline

[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.520]
We're pissed off at American right now. Okay, even those of us who like their food. By the way

[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.280]
Thank you very much for somebody sent me pop El Burre's rookie card

[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.560]
Man look at that thing

[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:18.060]
With his Soviet outfit on CCCP which is SSS are in Ruski

[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.280]
Man it's good thing you don't look that good anymore. I'll tell you people be talking

[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.040]
Here's a camera killer

[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.300]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing great?

[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.160]
Hey, you know, I can take it a week. I was lucky enough to be in Spain and then in Colombia

[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:36.820]
You know they don't even care what happens over here with the president the first thing on them people's mind in Spain

[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.880]
was a when was the bombing that stopped in Iran and

[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:45.940]
And I'm sorry to rack yeah, and the thing that was highest on the mind of people in Colombia are is the

[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:52.200]
You know when it is that we're gonna do more things with the drug trade when I asked about what about what's going on with our

[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.500]
In pigment they say well, it doesn't really matter to us with the president doesn't own business

[00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:04.360]
It doesn't matter to anybody with a brain anybody who's not the right so sexually repressed and so immature as the American media anyway

[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:09.060]
And the way it dominates our headlines and it doesn't even show up until the third or fourth story

[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:15.220]
Sometimes it doesn't even show up at all on a given night and they're TV right amazing and our country really is to take a look at what the whole

[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:19.120]

I'm serious. I mean, I know that over the years

[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.280]
He's probably never done more than two or three interviews where he really asked any significant hard questions

[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.960]
With other than just tossing his usual marshmallows because everybody's his good personal friend

[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.480]
I've been doing this a long time. Yeah suck an ass right

I hate her big and hairy pie.

[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.260]
Do you know who I knew?

[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.520]

[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.520]
Love a Monica.

[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:44.860]

[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.340]
Nicking out with Monica in my limbo.

[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.880]
I couldn't have picked the fat of Ben Boat.

[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.000]
Feeling patriotic of a black hole slope.

[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.400]
I'm a whole door sneerly choked.

[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.500]
When she sucked down my bit fat wheeled his down into the street.

[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.840]
Like an order in a building.

[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:01.840]
Hillary's mad.

[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.000]
I'm down in my knees.

[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.300]
It's the whiskey and the Dr. Reese.

[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.660]
It's the whiskey and my Dr. Reese.

[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.880]
It's the whiskey and my Dr. Reese.

[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.140]
It's the whiskey and my Dr. Reese.

[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.120]
It's the whiskey and my Dr. Reese.

[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.340]
It's the whiskey and my Dr. Reese.

[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.440]
Superstar report.

[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.580]
I really can't cope.

[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.600]
I'm the president.

[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.840]
Now the friggin' post.

[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.020]
The time is now when I'm coming clean.

[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.300]
I like my boobies with cherishing cream.

[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.740]
The boys on the field say they may in peace.

[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.940]
Or if I'm getting sucked by that two-time elite.

[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.240]
Trying to hire a crack pretty could these live just?

[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.460]
If she didn't spit, they must have quit.

[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.700]
When my crumets over in the tag to blow.

[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.140]

[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:41.600]
No.

[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.880]
She can tell if it's a once-hose or a bump.

[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.140]
I might have got sluts but I should not come.

[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.560]
Scared to death, Monica.

[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.400]
Look at this stance.

[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:49.820]
Excuse me, General Bum.

[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.580]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:50.740]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.440]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.860]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.020]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.420]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.560]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.900]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.060]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.500]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:11.040]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:12.980]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:15.480]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:15.480]

[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:15.480]

[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:15.480]

[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:15.480]

[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:15.480]

[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:15.480]

[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:15.480]

[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:15.480]

[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:15.480]

[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:15.480]

[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:15.480]

[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.200]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:16.700]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:17.980]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.400]
I'm getting a stand.

[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.740]
I got a little sticker that I'm ready to end this.

[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.860]
I saw a kid at Star doing linda trip.

[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.280]
Checking out the goodies I'm ready to pop.

[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:29.700]
Or everybody has let in my pants.

[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.320]
Eee, trot.

[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.540]
1046 is 560 WQM.

[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.000]
So General Manager Greg Reed was just down here moments ago.

[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:38.240]
Stuck his head in the door and said two very profound things.

[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.740]
Number one, I hear my haircuts sucks.

[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:40.660]
And I said yes, it sucks.

[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:43.080]
And number two, this is incredible.

[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:44.660]
All in three things.

[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.560]
Number two thing was the reason that the satellite dish upstairs

[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.280]
for the guys up on the third floor is on the floor.

[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.440]
It's the engineer's fault, which we've been hearing that right along.

[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.220]
It's the engineer's fault.

[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.100]
The dog done it.

[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:54.300]
And number three,

[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.560]
Sunday's his birthday.

[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:01.820]
Seriously, no.

[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.040]
I just want you to stop and think about this,

[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.300]
because I already knew that ahead of time.

[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.400]
And I wasn't going to re-play it.

[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.080]
Not that he's not an easy decent guy.

[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.900]
I mean, I feel sorry for him when I see him,

[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.660]
but he's not a bad guy.

[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.860]
But, uh, I mean, what kind of a person comes in and says,

[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.260]
Sunday's my birthday and looks at you there like with this,

[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.260]
like waiting like, yeah, and I said,

[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.440]
happy birthday, you know.

[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.340]
I mean, after you get to a certain point in life,

[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.160]
does it really make any difference that it's your birthday?

[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:26.540]
No.

[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.780]
Or praying that the next one takes like twice as long before it shows up.

[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.100]
Hey, George, I've ever fifthed my birthday.

[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.380]
I did that.

[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:37.840]
Oh.

[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.540]
I just, just in case you forgot.

[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:41.580]
Strange.

[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.080]
He seems a little bit the bizarre.

[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.840]
But nevertheless, we're kicking ass.

[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:45.440]
We're making money.

[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.280]
Hand over fist tears.

[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.140]
What he told me we had a gigantic January.

[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.620]
And I said, well, that's the case.

[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.180]
I'll come that this is sitting on the floor upstairs.

[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.280]
And they don't have like a real TV to watch it on.

[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:55.580]
And he ran out of here.

[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.260]
Here's a mobile and sunrise.

[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:57.680]
Hello.

[00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.280]
Hey, Mia, how you doing?

[00:35:59.400 --> 00:35:59.820]
Okay, sir.

[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.160]
I'm going to miss the passing of this whole impeachment thing.

[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.120]
Yeah, it's kind of like a hobby now.

[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:05.780]
It's like, oh, Jay.

[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:07.800]
It's a good reason to change the channel.

[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:08.480]
Uh-huh.

[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.140]
You know, there's not going to be any nudity.

[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.740]
So you can just continue to scroll through.

[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.960]
But on the other hand, I got to say that I'm a phone running phone.

[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.380]
I've helped you can take it for like four years.

[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:21.760]
Yeah.

[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.380]
I want you to have missed it.

[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.380]
Just imagine if you would spend all that money on tickets.

[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.460]
You could probably get a real phone.

[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.580]
But anyway, I'll call the phone.

[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.720]
So I can fix something up.

[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.700]
Oh, that's brutal.

[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.060]
That's a little like, huh?

[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:32.780]
How's that?

[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:33.240]
Is that better?

[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.000]
There you go.

[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:34.640]
A little bit better.

[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:35.920]
You like it when I take it up.

[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.560]
Um, but I, I saw that police game.

[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.000]
I'm sure you were there for the Surrendle Neverland.

[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.240]
You saw what game?

[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:44.100]
Toronto.

[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.040]
Oh, this is, uh, this is the guy with a fanny pack.

[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.040]
That's why he was doing a trying to disguise his voice.

[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:49.900]
Get out of here.

[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:50.920]
You're a pest.

[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:51.380]
You're a pan.

[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:52.300]
Oh my god.

[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.760]
It's the chronic starting again.

[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.800]
Can you, can you believe that?

[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.700]
That's the guy with a goddamn fanny pack.

[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:04.880]
They so called security guard over there in the Macarena who came and crouched down and, uh,

[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:09.240]
by maybe between periods and read bad breath in my face for like 10 minutes and couldn't get rid of him.

[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.100]
Jesus.

[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:15.600]
Two open lines in day five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on a mobile one line.

[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:16.360]
Man, oh man.

[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.520]
Some days I come in here.

[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.500]
I just feel like I'm covered with maggots, you know?

[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.140]
It's a very, uh, oh.

[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.200]
Horrible thing like waking up in the middle of the night and just discovering maggots crawling all over your body.

[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.820]
That's where sometimes feel what he's called.

[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:29.860]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.200]
Hello.

[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:32.360]
Neil, good morning.

[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:32.800]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.020]
How are you today?

[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:34.480]
Okay.

[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.340]
I just wanted to give you a little fire.

[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:48.100]
I'm a work to a lot of phone sales and receive a lot of solicitation and I got a call yesterday from the Christian correlation.

[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:48.860]
Yes.

[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:53.580]
And they were they were looking for some handouts and I told them, no, I'm sorry.

[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:54.400]
I was on the show.

[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.220]
Yeah.

[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:55.980]
Exactly.

[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.480]
So as soon as I said your name, they were pretty much didn't have a lot to say after that.

[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.160]
It's probably quick real fast.

[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:02.540]
Yeah.

[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.080]
I'm glad you're here.

[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:09.320]
And I'm supposed to be flying out of here next week on American Airlines on Friday.

[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:12.160]
So I guess I should start the start.

[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.000]
Starts with any other airlines is what I would do if you really want to get where you're going.

[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:20.680]
Well, are they going to, you know, the other airlines going to honor my tickets or?

[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:21.720]
No.

[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.000]
Of course not.

[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:23.920]
I'm just that.

[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:24.600]
That's the well.

[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:28.340]
Yeah, but you know, now what are these of these like special fear tickets or something?

[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.660]
Well, no, I mean, they were they were bought in advance and I bought them.

[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:37.380]
But if you know it was unless it's some kind of a special fear, you have a year or some airlines, it's two years to use those.

[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:41.220]
So if you just cancel your reservations, you can just use the same tickets later on.

[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:44.340]
And you could just change the dates.

[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:44.960]
Right.

[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.620]
You just swap them in for wherever else you're going, right?

[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:48.960]
I got you.

[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.600]
In fact, if I were you, I would call up American immediately.

[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:56.580]
Not sooner and find out what they're what the deal is on that because it all depends on the fare that you paid.

[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.180]
Some are like none.

[00:38:58.780 --> 00:38:59.400]
What is it?

[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.720]
Well, I mean, even under a fundable, you can still be on your own.

[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:02.400]
Non-transparent.

[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:02.720]
Non-transparent.

[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:03.680]
Not exchangeable or something.

[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.180]
Not exactly something.

[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.300]
So call them up and find out.

[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:07.280]
Tell them what kind of ticket you got.

[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:12.840]
And likelihood you can use them later on instead of gambling away your chances that I can solve this next week.

[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:13.900]
Because I wouldn't.

[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:18.700]
Yeah, actually my mother flew out of the part of American to New York a few days ago.

[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:18.940]
Yeah.

[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:21.680]
She got to the airport like it, you know, for in the morning.

[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:27.420]
She knew what to expect and they, I guess they threw on to a United flight up to New York.

[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.420]
And, you know, so it's basically, you know, you show up and hopefully.

[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:34.980]
That's the way you want to do it.

[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:35.460]
Be my guest.

[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.480]
I don't travel that way.

[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.880]
I'm not going to go there and hold my breath and hope that maybe they give me on another airline.

[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:45.200]
I'm going to make reservations on another airline and then tell them cancel tickets and I'll use them for six months from Sukers.

[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:46.340]
Yeah, I'm with you about it.

[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.060]
Okay, good luck, pal.

[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:47.640]
Thank you.

[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.220]
There you go.

[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.580]
Another airport bastard at American is screwing up his life.

[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.380]
I'm going to say it again when you've only got a few days here and a few days there and you're trying to plan your life.

[00:39:54.380 --> 00:40:01.700]
I see my kid a little bit of enjoyment out of it and some goddamn airline like American doesn't care enough about their customers to do whatever it takes to get this resolve.

[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.700]
I would say screw him is what I would say.

[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.880]
I would say I don't think I'm going to be flying them anytime again soon in the near future.

[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:12.180]
In fact, you know, I'm going to do right now because I'm so pork off and it hasn't affected me or anybody I know.

[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.160]
Maybe I don't have that card, my pocket.

[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.480]
I better go to my wallet right now.

[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:16.820]
Let's see.

[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:17.660]
Do I got it?

[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.080]
Where the hell is it?

[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.640]
Oh, I got a lot of crap in this wallet.

[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.400]
Here it is right here.

[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:29.240]
Here's my A advantage card, my frequent flyer A advantage card on American Airlines.

[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.680]
Pretty chinchy card.

[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:36.140]
You know, the other all the other airlines, Delta and Air Canada, all every other airline is sending you like a real plastic card.

[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:45.820]
This is what they send you like a little piece of paper and I'm so cutting what I just sliced it up with my scissors here and I will not be using American again.

[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:46.440]
They can go to hell.

[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.280]
They don't go anywhere that I need to go with them.

[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:56.440]
There is anywhere that they go that there are plenty of other airlines and yes, they do have better food, but you know, some palli my own food.

[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:57.580]
Cool.

[00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:58.980]
There you go.

[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.260]
Run in the old waste basket.

[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.740]
And, you know, how many miles could I have on their frequent flyer? Screw it.

[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.580]
They can have them with my pleasure.

[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.700]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.020]
Hello.

[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:11.100]
Hello.

[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:11.780]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:12.780]
I want you to be safe.

[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.480]
Thanks for making your call.

[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.480]
I got a question for you.

[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:16.720]

[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:20.440]
With all the media outrage today and the screaming and the shrying.

[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.760]
Pop, pop, pop, pop, yes.

[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.040]
Why haven't they outed Hillary Clinton yet?

[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.420]
Oh, General Reno is going to be doing that next week once this blows over.

[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:32.660]
Yeah, I mean, isn't it pretty obvious? Isn't that the reason why the president's going out with everything that walks?

[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.300]
For 14 years, they haven't had no relations, sir.

[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.220]
14 years, they haven't even touched it.

[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.760]
How do you know? That's true, isn't it?

[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.060]
That's what it says in the star.

[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:42.360]
And those tabloids, they know they're crap, man.

[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.360]
Yeah, well, maybe we can order here in Miami.

[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:50.420]
Now, if you had the ice princess that you were married to and you know, you'd have to get it somewhere, right?

[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:51.580]
I wouldn't marry that thing.

[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:52.920]
Okay, have a great day, sir.

[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:53.560]
What about Chelsea?

[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:54.220]
Yep.

[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.040]
Open line and poor Chelsea.

[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.600]
Poor Chelsea.

[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.860]
And those poor kids, the royal family, with their billions of dollars.

[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.520]
What are we going to do? They lost their mother.

[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:09.460]
This, seriously, the people in the media, the people who control the media, they are crazy.

[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:13.300]
They are certifiably need to be put away for a very, very long time.

[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:17.340]
By the way, what a great piece on CBC last night, which I'm sure nobody else in town saw.

[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:20.580]
I hate the walls of the track on the history of Maple Leaf Gardens.

[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:22.180]
God was that great.

[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.140]
On the big disc.

[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.120]
See if you got the big disc, you get to actually see stuff.

[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.060]
If you don't have a satellite disc, you're screwed.

[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:34.880]
10.54, I'm going to move this stuff away ahead because we're going to open up some time there in the next half hour.

[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.300]
We're getting really close, boys and girls.

[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.880]
We're getting close to the big vote.

[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.800]
Oh, strap yourselves in.

[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:41.700]
We'll carry it right here.

[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:45.700]
You'll be here in I and, and, and, and that stuff.

[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.420]
It's Friday, you bastard.

[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.380]
Out of the blue.

[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.160]
Staying dressed.

[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:52.960]
Poor sport.

[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.040]
And some is.

[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.180]
For nation.

[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.140]
Out of the blue.

[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.500]
All right, just nice for Kenny.

[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:01.360]
Star.

[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.360]
This is the best thing for this.

[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.660]
We'll be kept.

[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:11.740]
That'll be just how it's about.

[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:15.920]
Oh, it's protecting us from the legal blow job.

[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:17.880]
All right.

[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.020]
You'll be much, he would be proud.

[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.080]
On how Kenny shakes him down.

[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.480]
He owes a lot to Taylor Gunner Joe.

[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.160]
Who was the drunk and the flaming homo?

[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:34.000]
A blue.

[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:35.900]
Staying dressed.

[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:37.820]
And some is.

[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:39.800]
For nation.

[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.540]
Out of the blue.

[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:42.720]
Right wing.

[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.000]
Not the Kenny star.

[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.020]
Out of the blue.

[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.240]
Out of the blue.

[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:55.720]
It's 11 o'clock right on the nose here at 560 WQA and the Hank Goldberg show at 2.

[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:58.660]
We got Kim Bo campers 6th of end of night because the booster.

[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:02.620]
I was working his fat ass off this morning 10 o'clock tonight in Capitol, the gambling show.

[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:09.120]
Here's a facts from Bob who says Neil, I just got my brand new little dish and you are absolutely correct.

[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.220]
It makes cable looked like complete crap.

[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:15.800]
Haven't I been telling you that for years that you get a little dish and realize cable picture is crap.

[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:16.400]
What did that?

[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:23.340]
Bob says I don't know if this is a sign but as soon as I activated my dish, the first movie I watched on it was FATSO.

[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.280]
How do you like that?

[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.680]
The first movie that popped up on air was FATSO.

[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.320]
That's the honey tune.

[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.020]
He says it was a miracle from.

[00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:31.680]
Damn good.

[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.960]
Okay Bob glad you're enjoying your little dish.

[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.240]
I don't know how much I have to I mean I have no vestidens.

[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.840]
I don't have stock in any company that manufactures them.

[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.020]
I don't have anybody that's selling them.

[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:45.080]
I mean other than our friends that apply on TV people but they sell a lot of other stuff too.

[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:46.720]
Everybody and their brother are selling them.

[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.420]
You've got to get yourself a little dish.

[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:49.780]
Okay.

[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:54.940]
I mean they're making their relaxing the restrictions more and more even if you live in the middle of those condo commandos.

[00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:58.400]
You've got your own property and can stick it on there even inside your patio.

[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.700]
If you got a screened in patio you can stick it in there.

[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:05.800]
So it's just about anybody and everybody in America ought to have like a little dish and their cheap as hell.

[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:11.800]
And you get to watch all this great stuff and a beautiful real picture instead of watching the fuzzy crap from the cable company.

[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:13.300]
That one day it's not too bad.

[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.840]
Some days it might be pretty good and other days it looks like crap.

[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.100]
The DSS is hooked up.

[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.260]
They're running the wires now.

[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:20.600]
It'll be fine.

[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:21.100]
All right.

[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.680]
It'll be ready when by the time Hank comes up.

[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.000]
It'll be ready in the dish too.

[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:27.720]
How do you like that?

[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:28.500]
They're working on it.

[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:29.440]
Superstasy as I speak.

[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.420]
That was funny.

[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:30.740]
Yeah.

[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.320]
So there you go Fatso.

[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:33.520]
They're working on it right now.

[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:38.780]
Now if you guys upstairs will butcher up a little bit and get them to put in like a real TV instead of a little a three inch monitor.

[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.160]
They got then you'd have something like a real studio.

[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:42.980]
I mean he comes down here.

[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:47.000]
Tell me about I want a great January the station to hand and we're kicking ass and all the money that's coming in.

[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.240]
And I said to him, well how come that thing is sitting on a box on the floor there up there?

[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.820]
And they don't have all the stuff they need to do a show.

[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.180]
Oh, it's the engineers.

[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:53.840]
It's the engineer.

[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:54.200]
Yeah.

[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.580]
See that's the thing that really gets me.

[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:59.480]
I mean you know that those guys aren't making what you call a lot of money in this place.

[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:00.820]
They're not overpaid.

[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:01.660]
The engineers.

[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.560]
And they're only worked like 28 and 30 hours a day.

[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:11.420]
And no matter what goes on, no matter how much he expects them to do the impossible in a very minimal amount of time.

[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:13.760]
He's got the hopes but to go around and building blaming them.

[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:14.640]
Oh, don't blame me.

[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:15.340]
It's the engineers.

[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:16.220]
You know, I'm not cheap.

[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.280]
Right.

[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.640]
And it's Monday too, right?

[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.460]
Here's a mobile in four-letter deal.

[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:21.660]
Hello.

[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.980]
Mobile in four-letter deal.

[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:26.580]
Going once.

[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:27.880]
Going twice.

[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:29.100]
Long gone.

[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.940]
18 minutes they hung on for that.

[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:31.840]
What a waste of our money.

[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.260]
Here's a mobile in the Gables.

[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:33.540]
Hello.

[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:34.660]
Hey Neil, good morning.

[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:34.920]

[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:35.460]
Great.

[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:39.880]
You know my dish when it first came out plus installation was almost 800 now.

[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:40.520]
That's right.

[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:41.780]
It's like a tenth of that.

[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:42.860]
You know, there almost nothing.

[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.020]
They practically get more in now.

[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:44.340]
That's right.

[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:45.820]
They'll do installation free.

[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.580]
Anyone that doesn't get it.

[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.480]
When VCRs came out the first VCR I want $1,100.

[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:51.180]
That's right.

[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:51.540]
That's right.

[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:55.500]
Now you go out for like $99 or $150 bucks you buy pretty good VCR.

[00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:00.240]
And most of the time on the most of the days the best cable picture is just average.

[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.900]
So it really is, you know, four months bill and it's paid for itself.

[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.660]
I just had a question last night.

[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.100]
I thought it was a good effort.

[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.780]
Good defensive effort.

[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:09.520]
I didn't see it.

[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.340]
I was at the track end.

[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.840]
And oh, I'm so glad you reminded me by the way.

[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.680]
I'm trying to watch in between races some of the hockey game.

[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:16.960]
I did see we were head three to one.

[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:20.080]
And then all of a sudden sports channel on the system up there.

[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.700]
A popular practice crafts out and they have the sign on there.

[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:26.040]
You know, the thing that comes on like if you want to watch this stuff call this number.

[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:28.740]
I guess there's a description ran out and then they went off to some other channel.

[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:32.260]
And then we got a little help from the post in the crossbar.

[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:33.680]
But the only count when they go in.

[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.060]
Did Burke play last night?

[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:35.580]
No.

[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:36.800]
McLean was in the...

[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.340]
McLean played and they beat Ottawa last night.

[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:38.600]
Yes.

[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.080]
Oh my God.

[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:40.380]
Wow.

[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.400]
What are you going to do?

[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:42.560]
I just had one other question.

[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:43.620]
We'll get out of here.

[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:45.960]
Art Debt won out of Buffalo.

[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:46.700]
Yes.

[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:47.460]
He did.

[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:47.940]
Oh yeah.

[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:52.460]
Well, did you see any replay of the Kings last night to regall for three minutes?

[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.660]
I didn't even know who won the game.

[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.340]
The Kings and Philly.

[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:55.040]
That was the late game.

[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:55.380]
The Kings.

[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.260]
They won it over time.

[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:56.520]

[00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:57.940]
So Philly has lost two in a row?

[00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:58.580]
That's it.

[00:47:58.740 --> 00:47:59.360]
I'm proud of you.

[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:00.640]
That's the best part of the century.

[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:01.640]
Good luck in Montreal.

[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:02.340]
Thanks a lot.

[00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:03.460]
Okay.

[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:03.820]
There you go.

[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:08.160]
We have an open line in date 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:10.780]
So Philly, you know, sooner or later everybody gets theirs.

[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:12.780]
Flyers lose two in a row.

[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:13.740]
Two in a row.

[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.400]
I got to get this story in before this other stuff start.

[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.400]
I'll get to it a little later.

[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:19.480]
Rape ruling sparks protest in Italy.

[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.760]
Women legislators wore jeans to Parliament in Rome on Thursday.

[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.160]
And Italy's highest appeals court was accused of sexism.

[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.960]
After ruling it is impossible to rape a woman wearing jeans.

[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:29.560]
Oh!

[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.260]
That's right.

[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.680]
That's what they said.

[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:35.840]
The Italian Parliament says if a woman is wearing tight jeans, you can't possibly rape her.

[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.540]
She must be cooperating to get those pantaloni down there.

[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:40.140]
Otherwise, yeah, it so can't be raped.

[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.000]
What? Why, why, why are you stinging?

[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.120]
So you've never been to Europe.

[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:46.060]
They tend to be sexist.

[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.340]
They whistle at women on the streets.

[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:48.200]
They do that in Rome.

[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.060]
They do an Amsterdam.

[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.100]
They do it in most of the cities.

[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:52.780]
So they still do that pinching thing in Italy.

[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.620]
Yeah, they like to pinch an inch.

[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:58.480]
But that don't necessarily have anything to do with women.

[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:00.720]
We have an open line in Dave.

[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:01.720]
That's why I like to go there.

[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:06.200]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 kind of like fit right in with the surrounding.

[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.900]
So to speak, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:10.100]
So we're watching there's Bob Franken.

[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:13.020]
Who's been on the CNN over and over and over again.

[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.560]
These last 13 months going, blah, blah.

[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.980]
Yeah, come on, Bob, he's Bob and for it.

[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:23.160]
Any minute now, they're going to be coming back from their closed door speeches.

[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.720]
They're going to open it up again.

[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.320]
And then they're going to be voting on article one, article two, and they're going to be voting.

[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:34.080]
The only question is, it's not a question of if it's a question of by how much is Bob Greenwood say?

[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:39.640]
And we'll put it right here live on a year or so in your air. Everyone. It'll kill some good time too by the way

[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.700]
I mean a chance to sit back here think about lunch

[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:47.140]
Here is Miami Springs hello. Hello. Niel. Yes. How you doing great?

[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:50.760]
Good, but I don't even see the game last night, but it was a really good overall effort great

[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:55.640]
Excellent. It's about time McLean actually look good next this team's got to win some games without pop off

[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.560]
Burry. I'll tell you that

[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:01.620]
You're not shot like 25 17 and we won three to one yeah three goals on seven shots

[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:05.100]
No Peter. Well, I got one last night. I did see that the big black guy named Peter

[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:09.220]
Unbelievable. Uh-huh. Anyway, they're gonna be making a big case for him and he's a sniper is the line

[00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:11.000]
Yeah, instead of palabra we got Peter

[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.160]
Linda trip

[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.320]
Tell me she's not the nasty

[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:18.820]
Yeah, yeah, that's our full question today by the way

[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:23.980]
Is there any heterosexual guy in this audience who would touch Linda trip with the oh the thought of that is

[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:30.060]
I wouldn't touch her with your thing. I mean if you could be horny you could have been in prison for like 15 years

[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:33.020]
And you wouldn't touch her like you said with anybody else's

[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:38.220]
Also one other thing before I go yes, I just learned out a little while ago that I'm moving to Detroit. Yes

[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.260]
If I wanted to get a little dish

[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:44.820]
I know I'm getting one to see my cancer games. Which one's the best that gets the Florida sports channel?

[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:46.800]
Which system is the USSB?

[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:52.100]
No, no, that's not that's it's on direct TV. USSB is only movies. Okay direct TV

[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:55.940]
Gotcha, and then you just take your dishes to get your pocket and take it with you

[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:01.020]
Okay, good luck pal. Okay. There's a guy's going to Detroit. I'm so sorry. I

[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:01.180]
Mean

[00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:03.920]
Hear that for his sake

[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:09.260]
We have an open line of data. I mean years ago boy that was a place man pre-1967

[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:13.300]
Then they had the riots and they burned half the city down and it's you know they greeted down Tom

[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:17.980]
Little bit they had to run us on did ever make a comeback. No, it's gotten worse and worse and worse

[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:19.740]
And you go back there and you look at the neighborhoods

[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:25.300]
It used to be where all the wealthy people used to live and now oh my god like Palmer Park and Palmer Woods

[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:30.880]
And you say this can't possibly be like this. This is a gigantic slum or a millionaires used to live

[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.180]
But anyway, he's going we're not

[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:35.460]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:39.340]
Pomp 5 60 on it and here by the way Jeff Greenfield here is a man

[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:43.240]
Perfect for CNN because they don't want to be accused of being you know like one sided

[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:48.640]
So they got a guy I know who's like their resident curmudgeon who says absolutely nothing

[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:55.480]
Words no seriously words come out of his mouth, but he says absolutely nothing. Well, maybe this and maybe that

[00:51:55.480 --> 00:52:00.980]
And he's like just Casper milk toast. I mean, he just absolutely doesn't really say much of anything

[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.240]
Jeff Greenfield embarrassing

[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:10.960]
And there's that Frank says no who's still disgusted by the oh by the filth of this whole thing and address and oh and a seamen's thing. Yeah, yuck

[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:15.320]
Let's see where we go on here's a mobile in the bokeh. Hello

[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.420]
Yeah, Neil yes, sir

[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:19.460]
I'm real happy, you know that

And then tried to call a second time

[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:30.320]
You know damn well that she's listening she couldn't turn it off if you held a gun to her head

[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:34.160]
But she won't call back because she can't explain what she's all upset about

[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.600]
And I just keep wondering what is wrong with the humorless women in this town

[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:44.600]
Why are there so many pussy of tight humorless bitches in this town?

[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:49.980]
Oh, well my wife my girlfriend. She just hates you. Why?

[00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:28.510]

[00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:33.550]
Now they're gonna exploit all of the people who have been had to be silent until this thing was over with now

commenting on mold or eating a goddamn hot dog

[00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:06.850]
I like hey, I can't stand having to listen to those guys the mold

[00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:08.270]

[00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:13.030]

[00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:27.370]
And these people that don't understand the game boy they're sold it they probably got their blow up dollars for this weekend now

[00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:31.970]
There you go. I love that the rake ruling in Italy man. That's great. That's right

[00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:35.470]
That's on real next thing you know they're gonna be blame and gun makers for gun crimes

[00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:40.270]
If they're wearing a tight thing then they got to wiggle it off themselves and they want it

[00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:40.930]
See

[00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:43.090]
Think I'm a great thing. I'll read the urchin

[00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:51.310]
If we go on like this every woman that doesn't wear a chastity belt will have the right to be raped said the Sonya Viale of parliament's equal opportunities commission

[00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:53.550]
The court of Caescian

[00:59:54.570 --> 01:00:00.450]
Castration ruled on Wednesday. It is impossible to take off tight pants like jeans without the cooperation of the person wearing them

[01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:02.350]
And it said it is impossible if the victim is struggling

[01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:08.150]
The decision overturned the 1998 conviction of a driving instructor in southern Italy car mine

[01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:12.210]
Cristiano 45 for raping an 18-year-old student a lower court at sentence

[01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:14.010]
Cristiano two years and eight months in prison

[01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:18.370]
But the appeals court said the girl must have considered the section to advocate case back for retrial

[01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:22.890]
She had tight pants pants pantalones

[01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:29.870]
The court also questioned why the victim identified only as arosa why it waited several hours to tell her parents. She'd been attacked

[01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:37.190]
It could be seen as a manual for aspiring rapists the Rome Daily, El Mesagato said in the front page story

[01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:41.510]
Jeans and alibi for rape were to sign held up in parliament by five jeans plaid legislators

[01:00:43.290 --> 01:00:49.570]
Alessandro Mussolini a deputy of the rightest national alliance who letters days protest said women are already scared of reporting rapes

[01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:50.750]
This just makes it even worse

[01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:57.210]
Protesting legislators called on women all over Italy to join a skirt strike and wear jeans and the anchor of a popular TV

[01:00:57.210 --> 01:01:00.310]
shown on for her chic dresses done to pair of denims

[01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:05.670]
We thank the court for having enriched women's war droves of the new garment to the business suit and little black dress

[01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:11.670]
We can now add the anti-rape out to the comfortable and resistant pair of jeans said union official stephy honest it only

[01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:17.410]
Only in Italy baby. They just tend to be a little on the sexist side over there as in school the bitch

[01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:20.470]
Get her back in the kitchen and let's get some pasta out here, huh fast bitch

[01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:27.090]
We have an open line in the brower to and date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line

[01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:33.970]
Here's a mobile in four-letter day. Hello. Yeah. Yes. How are you? Okay? I want to tell you I'm an up

[01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:39.150]
We got about 20 or 30 of my

[01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:43.870]
The rest of them all hate me like toys and you keep me entertained every day

[01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:47.050]
I think it's great, but they only suck because I can't get to hear you

[01:01:47.550 --> 01:01:48.270]
Uh-huh

[01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:51.850]
Someone called in the other day and said how they could get your

[01:01:52.830 --> 01:01:57.030]
Radio station inside a building. Oh, you don't want I don't want to go to that you don't want to go through all that

[01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:58.410]
But the bullcrap believe it

[01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:04.430]
It's a lot of a lot of yeah. No, it's just uh, I don't want to go through the whole deal. Forget about it

[01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:09.610]
Oh, that's the only thing I can't get you inside the building when I'm working. Yeah. Yeah, I've tried

[01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:12.550]
And different radios well tilted on its side

[01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:19.810]
In the video to okay, okay, can I call someone to do stuff? Yeah, or if you're a gourmet club fucking douche bag

[01:02:19.810 --> 01:02:22.090]
Okay, yeah, yeah, oh

[01:02:22.090 --> 01:02:26.050]
Open line and date one and brown and five six seven. We're watching Frank says that was there he's going

[01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:27.830]
Bap-bap-bap-bap I guess we better do a break

[01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:30.770]
I mean, I'm sorry that we have to do this

[01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:36.530]
But you know, we got to move things along here because any minute now any so any hour any time now sometime between now and next

[01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:41.370]
Sookas they might actually go back there and vote on this goddamn thing get it over with it just can't the you know

[01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:43.790]
They just can't seem to get it together

[01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:48.170]
You know

[01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:55.550]
There once was a man named Bill who lived on Capitol Hill

[01:02:56.590 --> 01:02:58.070]
He gave me a dress

[01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:04.590]
Then made it a mess and I kept it under my bed in my house

[01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:06.050]
Nah

[01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:07.950]
That's not good

[01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:11.310]
Okay, let's say all right

[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:17.040]
No, this is not bad the white house is white

[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.580]
I signed in the lab book one night

[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.080]
No

[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:32.660]
Hickory dickory doc the president showed me his

[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.040]
No

[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.520]
Not good

[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:38.660]
Okay

[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:45.120]
Trust the night before Christmas and all through the house

[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.940]
Bill got naked except in my house

[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:53.340]
My parents were now so all snug in their bed

[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.840]
While I was giving the president

[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:57.580]
No

[01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:01.040]
No, that's no good either

[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.160]
1128 at 560 wqm were getting real close

[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:04.440]
I

[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.420]
Any moment now any second you're gonna hear that sound

[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:14.020]
Which means that they just came back into the chamber they said they actually said on CNN that they would open the doors for while

[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:15.800]
To let a kind of air out

[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:20.420]
Because Ted Kennedy had a real back to something last night some bad grits

[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:21.780]
Which gave him the

[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:26.800]
Something to rhymes with grits or maybe that was a strong thermon and anyway, there's big fat candy crawly

[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.140]
It's gonna be playing Linda trip in the movie

[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:33.800]
You know, I would say to George. I was saying this jokingly of course because I know where our priorities are in this radio station

[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:39.940]
With this boat coming up imminently any minute now. I was saying well, maybe we'll have to knock out a commercial break here

[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:43.040]
So we can carry it like uninterrupted

[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:46.280]
Now it's interesting if it were the Jimmy Johnson press conference

[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:51.000]
Which will recall that faker that phony who showed the pamphlets what a power play is really all about if we were him

[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:55.160]
With his frosted silver here then of course here on the sports station

[01:04:55.160 --> 01:05:00.560]
We would knock out as many breaks as many spots we'd put them on you know 10 weeks from poor them some other time

[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:06.020]
Because we don't want to interrupt something important like some sports press conference

[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:10.120]
But this is only you know, we'll vote on the impeachment the removal of the president of the United States

[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.100]
Do we care about that here on your sports on your juxtap station?

[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:19.040]
No enough to like eliminate spot. No, damn straight. We know. Oh, by the way, since the pompano spots coming up in a couple of minutes

[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.700]
And I don't want to like do it right on the heels of that the very close

[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:26.880]
If my close friend Ted snowsless enough there at pompano, which I notice you're conspicuous by your absence lately

[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.620]
Wouldn't it be nice for those of us on the sick floor in the dining room

[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:37.720]
Especially those groups are very elderly people like you had their last night if we have a bedding window open like even just one during the week like last night

[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.600]
You talk about shooting yourselves in the foot

[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:44.820]
So we've got all the windows on the one side where most of us sit

[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:50.960]
Closed and if you want to make a bet you got to schlep all the way down to the other end and most of those people are lucky if they can get up out of their seat

[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:55.400]
So it's like holding up a big sign saying I you don't really want to make a bet do you yeah?

[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.640]
You just want to eat a meal and the get out of here right

[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:01.400]
But they do have those uh those do-op singers again

[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:08.320]
Oh my god think how they didn't come by my table. I just looked the other way and I kept saying keep walking key the do-op singers

[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:15.620]
That's gonna really bring people out to the track, isn't it? Oh, man. What is with these people? What is with this town

[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:17.300]
this thinking

[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:25.380]
Just one window that would be nice for all of those of us who sit down at that end of the club out in the dining room and lend our tangible support by plunging

[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:28.380]
Our brains out. How about that sound Ted? How about it come on

[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:35.840]
Okay, send his votes on articles of impeachment are expected shortly. So as suck us for Christ sakes

[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:42.680]
Who now is this bitch? Oh Pat Harrison the the Republican National Committee coach here. I can't even begin to imagine what she's gonna say

[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.220]
Here's a mobile and Davie. Hello. Thank you. Yes, sir

[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:52.440]
I got a son's been picking me off and I want to get your opinion on it. Why is it that

[01:06:53.160 --> 01:07:01.220]
The broadcasting stations feel that they have to get these ex-assles these illiterate buffoons the broadcast games and do analysis

[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:07.480]
I mean it's ridiculous. There's so many now bread lunch burger and bob cost these guys obviously went to school the professionals

[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:12.180]
They're good to listen to sure they never played the game, but I can't understand it. Yeah

[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:16.220]
Um Jack that's where it's at man. It's a jackocracy

[01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:20.100]
It's they they just add to the mystique that these guys are stupid as they go

[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:25.680]
I mean all of them got these education. No, it's not a mystique. It's a fact. It's not there's nothing mysterious about it

[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:30.600]
That's a fact most of them are illiterate and uneducated and they had nothing they can't like Denise

[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:35.340]
Potman there's a classic example as nothing to anybody's understanding of the game no insight no nothing

[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:39.300]
Hey Neil. Yes, sir. So I'll 12 inch monster at the beach yesterday

[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:46.540]
Never could never believe it a whole beach was talking about this guy. I mean from from two or three two or three blocks around

[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:50.000]
Talking about look like he's stuck to snake in a case

[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:53.580]
Okay, we'll say how to defo for us any of you is hanging around somewhere

[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:59.720]
If it open line in a brown to and date five six seven oh five sixty pound five great excellent good call

[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:04.420]
Two open lines that's about to get on the air two open lines and date to a brown or two five

[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:08.240]
I see an audience again another asshole who thinks that if he says it's fast enough

[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.880]
Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa like that

[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:15.080]
That gets on the air does that help? No saying a real real fast like that. No, it doesn't work

[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:21.240]
Sorry, pal. I have to come up with some better idea. Okay something to enrich your pathetic little life

[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:29.080]
27 till noon. We're still waiting on it. We're still waiting. We're holding our collective breaths

[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:32.760]
I can see there's tremendous examine in his audience about this right no none

[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:42.160]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line Hank Goldberg with satellite dish between two and six this afternoon

[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:48.540]
Kim Bocapper six to ten and Kaplan Eddie Kay is gonna be excited about it because he'll be able to watch well

[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:51.960]
That all depends on what they get on the I should take that back

[01:08:51.960 --> 01:09:00.560]
I mean, it's one thing that they're putting the addition it's the another thing depending on what packages they subscribe to like maybe the sports packages

[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:05.540]
Let's not get carried away, okay? I mean, we're almost in building a day

[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:09.580]
See when Greg read comes down here and starts that crap, but well see engineers

[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:16.220]
See, I hate to break the news to you, but like in a real radio station what they do like when taxing and the I mean calling them real

[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:21.600]
That tells you a lot about this place when we were making the move from the old IOD into the other building up there on Sheridan street

[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.300]
What did they do they went out and they hired contract engineers who weren't really full-time on staff

[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:31.780]
But guys who are very very capable who came in and were paid by the hour to do an emergency job and worked there

[01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:36.360]
24 hours a day around the clock and got everything ready so that we were on air and there was all in there

[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:41.840]
They had like seven of them right what I what a concept and they wouldn't have needed seven they would need just one or two here

[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:47.640]
To be you know working around the clock fever slew to get that thing done right upstairs and get the TV in and get the vision

[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.960]
And like have it all ready to rock and roll for people to go on to your new radio show what a concept

[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:57.060]
I mean, you know to the beyond a one-hand talking about how we're kicking ass and all this money is flowing through this place

[01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:00.820]
And then on the other hand continuing to try to defend the cheapness of the mentality up there

[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:02.300]
Which he can't even afford like a real haircut

[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:07.480]
You know that he had no seriously. You wonder why his hair looks so bad. He has same with like a little scissors

[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.920]
In fact, it's just like these

[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:13.020]
Sam douchebag the in the fact that's probably Sam's main job here

[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:19.920]
Once a month Sam goes up with like a little pair of scissors with a blue handle like these and trims uh, Greg's hair

[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:22.020]
his little trim

[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:27.060]
Going on as we speak

[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:29.180]
In that orifice

[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:31.820]
That's why he looks so bad

[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:36.000]
It's 1135 at 560 wqn. There's Elizabeth Holtman

[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.040]
Democrat good lady there. Go she's a real good liberal from New York

[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:43.220]
There you go Jewish liberal. This will go away. We like him on this show on your right next shot there

[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:44.540]
Can't handle it. Can you're too bad?

[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:46.800]
Hey, child, kids getting bigger

[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:51.420]
You're a political horn

[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.980]
You're a political horn

[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:57.160]
Let's people ask me who

[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:00.560]
I would like to throw

[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:05.380]
Now that I'm a co-with her cohort

[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:11.720]
I tell them right away

[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:15.380]
I'd like a one night stay

[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:20.580]
Up in the white house behind closed doors

[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.880]
I want to be

[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:24.420]
Billy

[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.560]
I want to be

[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:27.860]
Billy

[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:31.300]
There's a girl with my life

[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:34.040]
The way she begins the ring

[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.120]
Touch it by words

[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.060]
Billy

[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:39.400]
There's a girl

[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.280]
If I was

[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:41.600]
Billy

[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:43.720]
There's a girl

[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:47.300]
I could be a piece of history

[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.440]
I'll call his hotline phone

[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:56.800]
Tell him I'm all alone

[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:01.440]
And I'm certain by his cellulite

[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.020]
You're a political horn

[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:06.960]
And his fee won't have fee

[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:10.220]
Then I'll ask Hillary

[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:15.120]
But I would rather make it all three

[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.280]
I want to be a political horn

[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.040]
I want to be

[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:19.460]
Billy

[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:20.640]
There's a girl

[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.600]
I want to be

[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:22.840]
Billy

[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.520]
There's a girl

[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.100]
With my life

[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.800]
The way she begins the ring

[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.020]
Touch it by words

[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:33.220]
Billy

[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:34.340]
There's a girl

[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:35.540]
If I was

[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:36.680]
Billy

[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:38.720]
There's a girl

[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:42.420]
I could be a piece of history

[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.660]
I want to be

[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:47.040]
Billy

[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:48.580]
There's a girl

[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:50.240]
It's a golden 41-5

[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.620]
You see, yes, walk by the way

[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:52.620]
Set in post on articles

[01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:54.220]
And impeachment are expected shortly

[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:55.320]
You believe it?

[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:55.700]
No

[01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:56.560]
Well, we're waiting

[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:57.720]
There's still going

[01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.380]
Bapapapa

[01:12:58.380 --> 01:12:59.800]
In fact, Frank says they're just

[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:01.020]
In Jesus Christ as they

[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:02.060]
This over with yet

[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.580]
I mean, how much are these guys

[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:05.840]
Supposed to say we've already heard

[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:08.900]
This 45,272 million times

[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:10.180]
Couple of great faxes

[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:11.580]
By the way, one from Jim and Sunrise

[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:12.160]
Who says

[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.680]
Miami, he coats Pat Riley

[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.120]
Today treated Stargard Kim

[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:16.600]
Hardaway for Monica Lewinsky

[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:17.580]
Now the whole team sucks

[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:17.980]
Oh

[01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:20.940]
Not bad

[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:22.320]
George don't understand that

[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.040]
He don't know Timmy Hardaway

[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:24.800]
From Penny Hardaway

[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.700]
From Penny Sir Mevon

[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.120]
But anyway

[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.300]
Here's the best facts of the year so far

[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:30.940]
The fat facts

[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.380]
It says

[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.500]
The Jeff High problem

[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:37.840]
Attention, Neil Rogers, dear Neil

[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.440]
I've been an avid listener

[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.360]
Slash fan of yours since I was in high school

[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.640]
Going on 15 years now

[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.800]
Never if I once questioned your superior

[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.680]
Intellect and decision making during that time

[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.200]
However, for the first time this has come into question

[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:52.120]
I've been a neighbor of Jeff and Judy High

[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.280]
For almost four years now

[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.320]
I live right next door

[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.500]
Since Mr. High has moved in

[01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.880]
The neighborhood has turned from a quiet peaceful area

[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.360]
Into a loud obnoxious fat-best of beer

[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:04.080]
Excessive eating and loud screeching yells around the block

[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.420]
During his tenure in our Pemberclimes

[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:09.160]
They've heard I've become a friend of their family

[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.140]
It really wasn't by choice

[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:11.960]
Fatso kept coming over to my house

[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.500]
I'm invited over to his house for all occasions

[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:15.860]
Christmas New Year's birthdays

[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:18.960]
And at these occasions I've witnessed some of the most disgusting displays

[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.140]
Of poor eating habits and bad hygiene

[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:23.900]
As Jeffy boy to take his two front teeth out for you

[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:27.080]
Were you aware of that that he has uh

[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.260]
I didn't know they were uh removable

[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:31.680]
Oh my remember what they used to look like

[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:32.520]
Yes

[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:36.680]
Mr. High almost killed my two-year-old son by accidently

[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.240]
Sitting his fat tubba-lard body on top of him one evening

[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.200]
He squeezed the life out of my boy

[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.620]
It was like watching a mac truck

[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:45.380]
Right over a frog at all the guts spilling out

[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:49.260]
Mr. High is constantly borrowing stuff from my house

[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:51.300]
The son of a bitch freeloader borrowed my ladder

[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:53.240]
And when it came back almost every wrong on the ladder

[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.160]
Who was bent inward

[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.920]
You know what it's like for a Jewish family

[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.860]
To sit at a Christmas dinner while Jeffy and the family say their prayers

[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:03.000]
That fat hypocrite is probably thinking about the porn on his computer

[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.340]
As far as his eating habits go

[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:07.600]
I've seen him put salad dressing on pizza by the gallons

[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.760]
Each our deans in one hand with chocolate cake in the other

[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:16.660]
Worse yet he will pull his shorts down while I was outside exposing the

[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:18.480]
Fattest ass that I've ever seen

[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:23.100]
He walks with a different lip every week so I have to help bring him groceries in the house

[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:29.540]
Please fire Jeff Hyatt says maybe if he loses a job it has to eat a

[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:31.760]
Camilla's house for food can lose some of that blubber

Hello. Yes, sir. Neil God. Yes

[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.720]
You are the voice of reason in South Florida

[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:32.260]
Quick

[01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:38.340]
Couple of quick comments on some subjects. I love your comments on the useless NDA

[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:40.040]
love your comments on

[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:43.820]
The proceedings that are going on that the president Clinton

[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:48.360]
I enjoyed your comment earlier with your caller when you were cutting up your American airline

[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.340]
Yeah, yeah

[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:53.520]
There are some other pushies out there aren't calling in about American Airlines and

[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:57.840]
I'm pledging not to fly them again and be put in this position and have their whole lives this ruptive

[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:01.520]
This is a bunch of crap. Someone else made a reservation for me

[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:05.780]
I'm flying home to Canada to see my mother and grandmother on Wednesday night on American Airlines

[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:10.080]
I haven't flown them in a long time. Oh my god. My mother had made taken care of making the reservations

[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:15.740]
I called her up last night or two nights ago. She's flying air Canada from California, but she's got me on American

[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:19.300]
Well, what does that tell you? I don't think so do you yeah? I said I'll tell you you know

[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:21.000]
I hope I see you and if I don't see you you know

[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.700]
Bring me back some magals or whatever I would demand a quick look at that wheel real soon if I were you because I guarantee your name in it

[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:29.940]
No, I made it. There's no problem there. I drew that one up

[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:34.300]
But anyway, uh, she you know, I call the American Airlines of course, you know

[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:40.560]
The girl on the phone guarantees me that this will not continue past the weekend our CEOs won't let go

[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:47.340]
How can she guarantee that how does she know that is she is telling me it's a spherical our CEOs will never let this go beyond the weekend

[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:47.720]
Right

[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:51.880]
She told me I was I said I'll just the American Airlines psychic reservation desk

[01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:55.160]
I figured you'd like to hear that comment by them anyway

[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:58.400]
I would switch over to air Canada immediately if not sooner

[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:05.540]
Well, and of course American won't let you do that until 24 hours before that's when then when I call and check in again on the international flight

[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:11.120]
Then they'll let me know if it's canceled, but your course is also wrong. You know, I'm gonna go to the ticket counter

[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:14.540]
What do you mean what do you mean they won't let you do that? I don't understand cancel

[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:17.980]
You can't cancel the ticket anytime you want it like you use the tickets later on

[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:19.140]
No, make hey

[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:24.580]
You're gonna lose whatever, you know, it's only me. I don't know. It's probably 50 bucks that even look into that part of a year

[01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:31.640]
But I figured I'll be on 11 o'clock news killing the supervisor from American Airlines Wednesday night and not that of being a Montreal, but you know

[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:38.140]
Okay, good luck pal. Thank you. Sounds like you'll need it. There you go another endorsement from American Airlines

[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:44.480]
Open line and Broward all three in date county five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line

[01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:48.000]
We're still waiting believe me. We're not holding anything back here. Okay, we're still waiting

[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.600]
Your toenail okay

[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:57.000]
As they just keep driving see I don't understand this because there was three there were three senators yet to speak 50 minutes time

[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.120]
Three is 45 minutes with maybe a couple of seconds for you know clearing the airtime or whatever they were doing

[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:05.460]
So that might have been an hour they convene the goddamn ticket

[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:11.360]
950 when they thought when the preacher there finally finished with is in vocation whatever the hell they do

[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:15.540]
Totally inappropriate comments by the way, so that was 10 before 10

[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:21.220]
What what now are they doing in there they must be having an origin in there. I would imagine

[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:27.740]
Maybe they got Monica back in the rig and here's Carl spring. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir

[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:33.500]
You know he's from Utah or in snatch. Yes

[01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:40.740]
He is one of the people that's gonna take a big hit when they start investigating this whole other big thing

[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:46.560]
Because he was one of the big pushes one of the big backers out there and now they're gonna have all kinds of problems coming before that

[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:49.600]
I think him up and it's interesting because he seems to be the biggest

[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.920]
Tenshure out there know he's not his orange snatch

[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:58.220]
I don't agree at all. No you think it's a defending one. No, I think he's like more in the middle

[01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:02.840]
He's I mean compared to some of the fanatics like Jesse Helmson's drama thermon. He's for he's almost like liberal

[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:08.960]
Oh, I'm a statement. Okay, I have a great day. Now we're in snatch quite frankly. I could almost live with him if he weren't from Utah

[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:12.540]
That's where his problem is he's from Utah the other than that. He's been out all that bad

[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:14.940]
Even Ted Kennedy goes to lunch and they get drunk together

[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:19.980]
Let's see article now they're showing the article of impeachment. We already know what they say. Okay. Here's article one

[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:23.420]
There's article two. Let's stop stalling for time there. I'm CNN. Okay

[01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:35.560]
Just knock him all aside and get this thing going already

[01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:41.200]
Man, oh man. We got important stuff going on here like you know draft picks to talk about

[01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:20.280]
Anyways, as soon as that happened in I go down I never run around there, you know

[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:25.120]
I just have school around there, but in any case I start flashing my lights to let everybody know

[01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:29.800]
That I'm doing this because there's a couple of guys back there with the radar detector

[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:34.240]
Because you were flashing your lights is that what you're gonna tell me to me they pull me over

[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:40.880]
I see a guy walking in the middle of the road because at this point I'm going like 25 miles an hour. Yeah, flashing my lights

[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:46.060]
And then what you see is guy walking in the middle of writing for in front of the first union bank

[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:49.160]
Yeah, fine island. Yeah, you're stuck me in the middle of the road

[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:52.980]
He doesn't even let me pull over to the side in the middle of the road for flashing your lights, right?

[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:54.900]
All right, I'll call us when you get out

When he makes it we go

[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:58.500]

[01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:19.540]
Oh yeah

[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:25.500]
What you gotta do is take a sip of real love

[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:28.300]
If we're in a friend oh yeah

[01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:39.500]
Probably one at five sixty w. You can be by the way staggering turn of events

[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:42.560]
They've decided not to even vote on impeaching Bill Clinton instead. They're gonna

[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.560]
We'll impeach Ken Jenny

[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:43.860]
Oh

And convict him like in about two and a half seconds. We're all gonna vote

[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.440]
On all articles

[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:54.180]
Ken Jenny and the pleasure police striking tear into pleasure seekers all over

[01:26:54.180 --> 01:27:01.660]
Broward County from pillar to post from the a date Broward line from Miramar from Helen Dale Beach Boulevard and Miramar Parkway all the way up to

[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:02.520]
What

[01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:08.860]
Your field what's what's the northern most part of Broward County is a dear field beach? I think so yes

[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:13.640]
Okay, and everywhere in between okay all the way up to the Everglades all the way out there to the goddamn

[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:17.620]
Sawgrass and then a little bit all the way over to the goddamn ocean and everything in between

[01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:21.400]
Ken Jenny and the pleasure police and Broward just devastating

[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:25.400]
Sticking they know as in everybody's back to another private parts

[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.160]
Here's a mobile in for Lauderdale. Hello

[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:38.760]
Mobile in for Lauderdale. Hello Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, listen. I gotta say I work for CMBC as an anchor and I come down here a lot

[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.880]
You are about as much a part of Florida for me is a brickle Boulevard or this game bay

[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:47.800]
I go back with you to Zeta for and then I OD and in fact

[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:54.220]
I still run around with that girl from Ipanema bit on a little cassette the Brian Cox and the rest of them are singing that out of that

[01:27:54.220 --> 01:28:01.040]
So, right. Yeah, well, I have you in I mean I'm indoctrinating the people in our newsroom with you now because I can get you on the web

[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:07.660]
So I just want you to know I it would not be a normal Florida vacation if I couldn't find you somewhere on the dial

[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:14.820]
Let me ask you something since you work for CMBC. Yeah, and even though I'm sure you work in the news part not in the stock market deal

[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:21.140]
No, I am I'm a business anchor. Oh, you are. Yeah, really? Well, let me answer this because I thought that on today of all days

[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:22.700]
Unless they're waiting for a gigantic turnaround

[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:25.700]
I would have thought that today would be a day the market would go zooming up

[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:29.740]
But then as they're taking a big dump at sound 55 and a half and the dial is down about 30 summer

[01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:32.220]
I would have thought that maybe maybe they're waiting until after the

[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:37.600]
Votes you know on the stock market first of all what you're talking about is what we call a relief rally where

[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:41.180]
Whenever it is that was supposed to be horrible doesn't happen and everybody buys

[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:46.860]
Unfortunately, you got several other factors at work here number one at the five eight people like the square positions ahead of the weekend number two

[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:52.040]
You got some problems with some of the high text talks. You have a lot of profit taking after an incredible run up yesterday

[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:54.680]
The nannet deck was up almost a hundred points right record

[01:28:55.320 --> 01:29:01.120]
So you got people taking money off the table and also there's a motto on our business called by the rumors sell the news and

[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:06.620]
So you know, in fact what's happening is happening to sell on the news. There's always there's always some reason

[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:11.180]
There's always some sugar in the wood pile. It's just just I think everything is going to rate like yesterday

[01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:13.240]
I see the markets have 180 points on the dial

[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:19.400]
I'm watching the ticker with the at 405 and here comes my caterpillar my depressed caterpillar stock down a quarter of a point

[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:23.760]
On a day when the market goes up 200 points and my caterpillar goes down a quarter of a point

[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:30.580]
Well, you know the bottom line here is you know the excuse mavens as I like to call the people we get on the air who tell us why the market is doing what it's doing

[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:35.480]
They've all got their own acts and they've got their own reasons for why they say what they say but the bottom line is the market

[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:40.660]
We'll do with the market. We'll do and you know, it's pretty pricey the valuations are high and a lot of folks are nervous

[01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:44.460]
You guys do a great job by the way. I have no idea what do they like bringing the lunch from outside

[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:50.920]
These guys I've mentioned this on here many times the CNBC people are the longest hours of anybody in the media in the history of

[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:55.980]
Television radio you name it Joe Kernins on air from like seven o'clock in the morning those six or seven o'clock at night

[01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:59.540]
I don't think he sleeps. No, he does he gets a working lunch break

[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:03.760]
But he Joe works hard and now you probably know my name is Ted David and I'm on him

[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:09.320]
See all of them well and I do market rap with rebuyderomo from five to six absolutely and then when Griffith's not out

[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:11.700]
I do put one to nine in I do power lunch and then I do street times

[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:15.320]
He they work as hard, but it's it's a nice place and it's a lot of fun. You're doing a great job

[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:18.760]
Well, thanks me on again. It's really I'm not joking. I'm not being patronizing

[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:22.860]
It is always good to know when I'm talking my fat behind in the beach wherever it may be

[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:26.980]
I got a walkman on and I know I can find you some place. Thanks a lot Ted good talking. Thank you

[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:29.040]

Jewish boy always trust the guy with two first names. That's what I say especially if one of them is Jewish like David

[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.300]

credulous look on his push

I've always told you many times about what a real hard bit in son of a bitch Bernie Shaw is that's why we like him right

[01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:52.080]
Yeah, he got to lighten up a little bit too open lines in date five six seven oh five fifty by the way

[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.200]

Impeding the administration of justice in that

[01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:39.700]
On august 17 1998 yeah, William Jefferson Clinton swore to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth

[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:43.420]
Before a federal grand jury of the United States

That's a shock.

[01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:13.600]
Mr. Cannon, not evacuated.

[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:14.100]
That's shocking.

[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:15.340]

Mr. Wyden.

[01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:50.640]
5445, not even close on this one.

[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:52.000]
Well, I thought this one was not going to be close.

[01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:54.180]
The other one's going to be nip and tuck baby right down the wire.

[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:55.340]
Yeah.

[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:57.040]
And there's one to go.

[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:58.460]
That looks like 99 to me.

[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:01.620]
Looks like 99 to me, Mr. Clark.

[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:03.600]
Yeah.

[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:06.080]
I think it's Arlen Bush in Spectra,

[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:08.740]
but if this balloon have a, he's thinking about it.

[01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:10.880]
He's looking to see if he can find a man to pull it.

[01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:14.100]
Inspector, the Pennsylvania Republican,

[01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:18.760]
if we heard him correctly, said not proven he had indicated he would do that.

[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:23.380]
And apparently, the Chief Justice is going to allow that to stand.

[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:28.440]
Although he said earlier before the vote that the statement from each senator

[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:30.960]
would be guilty or not guilty, Jeff, you're shaking your hand.

[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:31.340]
What about you?

[01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:34.960]
You will be recorded as present, because there is no way for it to work.

[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:35.560]
OK, that's it.

[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:36.440]
OK, send other words to you.

[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:37.180]
It went out.

[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:38.580]
You wanted to say not guilty.

[01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:39.600]
You didn't have the balls to do it.

[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:42.040]
OK, 24 after I knew that 560.

[01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:44.000]
So the counted Arlen's Spectra is no.

[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:45.040]
OK, so it was 54.

[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:46.120]
Oh, yes, and 46.

[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:47.100]
No, I mean, 54.

[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:47.760]
How does that?

[01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:48.420]
55.

[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:49.280]
What did I get?

[01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:50.240]
I got it wrong.

[01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:51.820]

[01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:52.380]
45.

[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:53.700]
No.

[01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:54.660]
It was?

[01:46:54.940 --> 01:46:55.040]
Yes.

[01:46:56.780 --> 01:46:57.140]
No.

[01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:57.720]

[01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:58.320]
No.

[01:46:58.600 --> 01:46:58.900]
Yes.

[01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:00.700]
Yes.

[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:01.360]
No.

[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:02.260]
No, seriously.

[01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:03.220]
Was it 55.

[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:03.920]
55.

[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:04.660]
No.

[01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:07.540]
It's 55.

[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:08.020]
No.

[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:08.640]
It's 55.

[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:08.640]

[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:09.520]
And 45.

[01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:09.980]
Yes.

[01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:11.340]
Yes.

[01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:13.180]
OK, that's what it was.

[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:14.220]
So that went on.

[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:17.720]
So that means they got 10 Republicans who voted on that.

[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:17.920]

[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:21.540]
Which that was not the one that perjury they said was weak and said it went so on.

[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:22.600]
And now we're getting around.

[01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:23.000]
They're reading.

[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:23.960]
Let's get this on here.

[01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:25.740]
OK, they're reading our number two.

[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:26.100]
Stop up.

[01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:27.580]
Oh, God.

[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.160]
We're getting this over with.

[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:30.180]
Though you feel better already.

[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:30.760]
Yeah.

[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:33.100]
Influence the testimony of those witnesses.

[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:35.920]
So the second one, obstruction justice is under our solicitation.

[01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:36.740]
I think that about the way you look.

[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:38.640]
OK, and the house managers are reading.

[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:39.220]
They're tweeting.

[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:39.940]
They're tweeting.

[01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:40.500]
They're hoping.

[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:42.120]
Calls the grand grip.

[01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:43.520]
They're talking to the real white women.

[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:45.440]
They're saying, oh, wow.

[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:46.400]
Can't believe that.

[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:49.220]
In all of this, William Jefferson Clinton.

[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:52.060]
Yeah, as undermined the integrity of his office.

[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:52.360]
Yeah.

[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:54.700]
Has brought this repute on the presidency.

[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:55.840]
Oh, my God.

[01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:56.140]
As the President.

[01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:56.880]
Oh, my God.

[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:57.180]
As the President.

[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:01.680]
And has acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law.

[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:06.500]
To the manifest injury of the people of the United States.

[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:07.140]
Uh-huh.

[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:11.280]
Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton by such conduct.

[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:13.480]
Orn's impeachment and trial.

We've learned that the American Airlines blows

[02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:32.040]
We've learned that the 10 David at CNBC is a vacationing down here listening to the show

[02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:38.240]
I'll tell you one thing that was that was great. That was a fantastic because that's the that's the one channel of all those cable channels

[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:40.920]
That's great. They're all professionals on there. They're fantastic

[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:43.380]
Even though some days they have very very bad news

[02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:47.880]
Of us by day, they're not responsible for that their professionals looking up in the book

[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:50.600]
And here's that facts from somebody on the inside

[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:54.360]
We keep getting facts of some queer channel from people that are working inside over there

[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:56.420]
I don't want Ronda to get all bent out of shape, but

[02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:59.960]
It says Peter Bulger is the black hole of radio in South Florida

[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:04.160]
The corporate sucking is so hard not even a lot a light kin escape

[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:07.860]
It says and it says by the way brook is really kicking ass right?

[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:08.640]
Right

[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:11.400]
I don't think so

[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:16.320]
Okay, whoever that is inside over there Christian. Of course. It could be one of one of many people. I'm sure

[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:18.620]
I have a feeling it's from John Ford

[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:25.560]
Huh, yeah, let's start spreading the room into John Ford to send us hate facts is over here about Pete Bulger

[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:28.160]
I wouldn't want to give him no trouble or anything would we? Huh?

[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:30.160]
John Ford little puddle wacker

[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:33.080]
Okay, where we going Fort Myers? Hello

[02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:39.900]
Hi Neil. Yes, sir. I follow the liberal republican. Yeah, well, he's going to change your life

[02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:41.620]
Yeah, well, that's good least he's changing

[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:45.960]
Uh, you're right. This is a historic moment in the history of our country. Yes, sir

[02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:51.360]
I would have gotten through the entire trial now hearing a word of it had you not played the vote

[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:54.060]
But I kind of blame you for that. I would have done it. It was fun

[02:04:54.060 --> 02:04:56.340]
It was over the top

[02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:03.280]
Here's my point that I'd like to make I thought when Ted Kennedy laid out that second

[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:08.640]
I think the real tragedy of this whole thing would be

[02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:13.460]
If the greatest piece of American radio ever created was lost from this point on

[02:05:13.460 --> 02:05:18.100]
I'm talking about your song Bill cigars and my oh no, that's uh, that's uh, that will never be lost

[02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:22.680]
You'll keep playing classic god bless. I might just play it the whole last hour. Did they just non-stop?

[02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:28.000]
You make me really happy tell me something is that available commercially or for download or for any way to get a copy of that?

[02:05:28.060 --> 02:05:32.060]
No, but if you send Georgia cassette would like you want to talk to Georgia about he might work it out for

[02:05:32.060 --> 02:05:32.700]
I would love to

[02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:36.400]
Okay, hang on. Okay. There's a few bucks for a Georgia and tell him not to make it out to wiod

[02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:41.340]
I'm one aware of that guy was he wants a copy of uh, uh, that thing. No

[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:46.960]
Come on Georgia with it. So at any rate uh, yeah, what was still continued to play that

[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:50.840]
Well, I just lost my train of thought. I have something so damn important. Oh, yeah

[02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:55.240]
The guy that sent Georgia a ten dollar check to make out a thing a copy of something on cassette

[02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:57.020]
He makes the check out to wiod

[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:01.520]
Is the guy going to get the thing he wanted? No

[02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:05.940]
And is the check that he sent us in a waste basket at this point? Yes

[02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:09.800]
Wiod oh, I hate that station. Here's Miami. Hello

[02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:11.600]

[02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:18.560]
Going once going twice probably a sour answer Republican. Okay, two open lines in date five six seven oh five sixty

[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:20.440]
five sixty on a mobile one line

[02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:23.720]
Here's Coral Springs. Hello. Hey, how are you today? Okay, sir

[02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:28.980]
Um, I never looked before because I don't look at the signs locally. You don't need to watch

[02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:36.320]
Highway signs. Yeah. Did you when you come from south to north on 75 to get off at the sawgrass mills?

[02:06:36.420 --> 02:06:46.460]
You get off at sunrise. We'll have our correct. Okay. If you don't you get to pay a 75 cent poll about three quarters of a mile later

[02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:52.140]
Absolutely correct right today for the first time and I travel it 20 times a week

[02:06:52.140 --> 02:06:59.160]
I look up at around all the world their signs are and one quarter of a mile before you get to sunrise boulevard

[02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:03.400]
Yeah, fine. It says sawgrass mills one mile

[02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:07.740]
They want they want they want your money

[02:07:07.740 --> 02:07:12.940]
Try to them building Patsalano boulevard. How did you get to sawgrass mills?

[02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:15.260]
How did I get there?

[02:07:15.380 --> 02:07:17.080]
Got off at sunrise. How did I get to?

[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:19.520]
I don't know. I know you're in your house. I walked about 10 blocks right?

[02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:22.220]
You and I come in there. We'll be called the back way. Right.

[02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:28.500]
But if you're coming up and down the sawgrass for 75 right prior to Patsalano when you were coming north

[02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:33.140]
You got off at sunrise for free. Sure and if you're smart and I'll still do the same thing. Of course you will

[02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:35.420]
But that's fine. Couldn't have gone up that long ago

[02:07:35.420 --> 02:07:40.540]
In an addition of which if you're coming from the south anybody that goes to the macarena and gets off at the

[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:46.180]
Patsalano is crazy because if they get off at sunrise all they got to do is go east just a few blocks to

[02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:51.200]
166 Panther Parkway make a left there and there's the arena in 20 seconds. I just love that sign of

[02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:55.620]
So for the first time today and what they're telling you is the the science right now for free

[02:07:55.620 --> 02:08:02.340]
Don't be 50 dollars. That's right. You go who gets that money? Who gets it? Yeah, that'd be bad. I'm local divide. Maybe Patsalano is getting it

[02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:06.700]
I think so so we can go and tear those neon signs down. I have a great day. In fact, yeah

[02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:08.620]
That thing in sunrise by the way

[02:08:08.620 --> 02:08:11.780]
We want to say it again. We want to reiterate what we said yesterday. We're all for you baby

[02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:17.000]
Lots of neon we wave a lot neon neon in sunrise at least he's under the age of 100 anyway

[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.200]
Maybe a scumbag, but he's under the age of 100

[02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:28.500]
God the repressive the seeers another day. This is a great day for America because the forces of repression and anti-humanism have lost

[02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:30.320]
That's why it's a great day for America

[02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:37.880]
And all these sanctumodias hypocrites including by the way every one of these congressmen every one of these senators even the ones who voted no

[02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:43.660]
Oh, well, we find it personally repugnant and disgusting and all these media talking heads

[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:52.520]
Well, everybody is grossed out in a poll show that the polls show that the public says whatever you want them to say about is a disgusting and grotesque because they've been conditioned to say

[02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:55.200]
Oh, yes, we're revolted. And these should never be getting those blow jobs

[02:08:55.200 --> 02:09:00.500]

[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:13.260]

[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:15.800]

Hey, he'll do it. Okay, sir

[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:11.560]
Have you seen you may have been talking about him since about earlier if you seen the new article in Miami

[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:14.020]
New Times about popl burry no

[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:22.420]
No supposed talk about criminals in professional sports. Oh that's old stuff about the mafia in Russian mafia

[02:15:22.420 --> 02:15:28.900]
What why are they rehashing that crap? Who cares about that? Did you see it stuff about these supposed heads of the mafia?

[02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:29.080]
Yeah

[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:37.420]
You're cutting out coming on the real phone about something good not that same old tired stories

[02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:41.140]
You know, let me say what I said when we first got popl burry in this town

[02:15:42.060 --> 02:15:44.060]
We've got a great legitimate

[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:50.080]
bonafide superstar and those people of a comparing to Gary Sheffield because they both making about 10 million or sheffield did when he was here

[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:57.900]
Know nothing about popl burry nothing about hockey nothing about sports Gary Sheffield never was and never will be a superstar on the level of a popl burry

[02:15:58.460 --> 02:16:01.840]
Well, I still say may not be the best player in the world, but he's the most exciting

[02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:12.580]
Okay, you ought to shout over doubt when he's playing and then you got to rehash all this old tired stuff about the Russian mafia and how they terrorize these Russian players and

[02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:18.900]
Shrup them down and threaten their families that stuff for anybody that would have been paying attention is older than foster you it, okay?

[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:24.300]
But you know, so instead of like dwelling on the positive like wow

[02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:29.340]
We finally got something we've been excited about here. No, let's dredge out all this old bull crap

You imagine the following five or 50s being about Stephen's things on the dress of what maybe

[02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:46.430]
you want to Thomas Jefferson slaves?

[02:21:46.430 --> 02:21:46.770]
No.

[02:21:47.010 --> 02:21:49.350]
Well, there's the president's semen on one of those dresses there.

[02:21:49.350 --> 02:21:49.490]
No.

[02:21:49.610 --> 02:21:50.750]
Let's check the DNA evidence.

[02:21:50.970 --> 02:21:51.150]
No.

[02:21:51.450 --> 02:21:53.930]
Thank God they didn't have no DNA testing back then, right?

[02:21:54.050 --> 02:21:54.290]
Yes.

[02:21:54.670 --> 02:21:54.890]
God.

[02:21:56.410 --> 02:21:59.030]
They would have said, man, you people of the future are crazy.

[02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.630]
You're in the bedbug.

[02:21:59.690 --> 02:22:01.150]
We better keep everything right here in the past.

[02:22:02.050 --> 02:22:05.170]
Hey, listen, we got a lot of people this country working feverishly to try to do that.

[02:22:05.930 --> 02:22:06.290]
Exactly.

[02:22:07.650 --> 02:22:08.590]
Open-line and broward.

[02:22:08.690 --> 02:22:09.670]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5.

[02:22:09.790 --> 02:22:12.650]
Like the old religionist baby, let's throw back the dark age.

[02:22:12.650 --> 02:22:13.390]
That sounds good.

[02:22:13.850 --> 02:22:17.610]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:20.530]
Here's a mobile in Miami Lake.

[02:22:20.670 --> 02:22:20.870]
Hello.

[02:22:21.430 --> 02:22:22.210]
Neil, God.

[02:22:22.350 --> 02:22:22.850]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:23.430 --> 02:22:24.310]
Two things, Neil.

[02:22:24.930 --> 02:22:29.190]
First of all, well, unfortunately you talk about people trying to throw back the old days.

[02:22:29.490 --> 02:22:30.410]
Some of them are succeeding.

[02:22:30.610 --> 02:22:32.010]
They haven't come out of there.

[02:22:32.110 --> 02:22:35.010]
Those militia in Michigan and whatever.

[02:22:35.630 --> 02:22:36.870]
They're living way back then.

[02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:37.710]
And I don't think.

[02:22:37.890 --> 02:22:37.890]

[02:22:38.270 --> 02:22:39.010]
On the vote.

[02:22:39.010 --> 02:22:46.230]
I had for those many actions the other day when you went to a commercial and I switched to a douchebag limbo.

[02:22:46.350 --> 02:22:46.970]
Lauren Assia.

[02:22:47.330 --> 02:22:48.510]
And he had people call him.

[02:22:48.690 --> 02:22:52.650]
You've got to believe we're going to get those 12 votes that we need.

[02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:54.150]
They're going to see the light.

[02:22:54.650 --> 02:22:55.810]
They're going to know the truth.

[02:22:56.190 --> 02:22:57.530]
You have to always be not get there.

[02:22:57.810 --> 02:22:58.550]
No, no, no.

[02:22:58.610 --> 02:22:59.650]
We got 10 of them.

[02:22:59.870 --> 02:23:01.330]
No rational person, sir.

[02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.710]
Believe.

[02:23:02.050 --> 02:23:04.110]
Nobody believed that they were going to get 12 Democrats.

[02:23:04.530 --> 02:23:08.930]
The only question was were they going to get a simple majority on either one of the answer was they did not.

[02:23:08.930 --> 02:23:09.730]
They did not.

[02:23:09.730 --> 02:23:09.990]
They did not.

[02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:10.530]
Very clearly.

[02:23:11.350 --> 02:23:17.590]
And the second thing is you know, you were talking the other day about how ugly those guys are what's the name Ron Jeremy or whatever.

[02:23:17.770 --> 02:23:18.510]
They're all seniors.

[02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:20.270]
They're in those poor no thing.

[02:23:20.450 --> 02:23:20.610]
Yeah.

[02:23:20.770 --> 02:23:22.150]
He said how can people stand there.

[02:23:22.430 --> 02:23:28.710]
And I was wondering about could I see a couple of them late at night on the on some of the stations that I got one of those magic boxes for.

[02:23:28.790 --> 02:23:31.290]
But it's because I never look at the guy.

[02:23:31.530 --> 02:23:32.410]
I'm looking at the girl.

[02:23:32.470 --> 02:23:34.570]
What about the women that are watching?

[02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:35.830]
I know they're not gorgeous.

[02:23:35.830 --> 02:23:39.950]
I know they have a lot of reckons about the size of a softball.

[02:23:40.170 --> 02:23:40.230]
Yeah.

[02:23:40.530 --> 02:23:42.310]
You know, it's just enjoyable to watch.

[02:23:42.530 --> 02:23:48.610]
But I mean, for the same money, wouldn't it be more make more sense to have like good looking naked people having sex?

[02:23:48.810 --> 02:23:50.910]
I mean, it just very much makes sense to me.

[02:23:51.330 --> 02:23:54.690]
It makes very much sense to me, but I was wondering why I never noticed the guys.

[02:23:54.810 --> 02:23:55.650]
I don't look at the guys.

[02:23:55.650 --> 02:23:56.770]
You're sorry about that.

[02:23:57.230 --> 02:23:58.110]
I'm not looking at the women.

[02:23:58.130 --> 02:23:59.330]
Okay, we believe you.

[02:23:59.330 --> 02:23:59.730]
Never.

[02:24:00.410 --> 02:24:01.250]
We believe him.

[02:24:01.370 --> 02:24:01.690]
No.

[02:24:02.410 --> 02:24:02.990]
How can you not?

[02:24:02.990 --> 02:24:05.330]
I mean, how can you must have a special eyesight?

[02:24:05.550 --> 02:24:08.930]
Can you, can you like somehow selectively like peel them out of your vision?

[02:24:08.930 --> 02:24:11.410]
And it's like, yeah, he's putting a thumb on it and a screen too.

[02:24:11.410 --> 02:24:11.850]
That's right.

[02:24:12.890 --> 02:24:14.010]
He's got his thumb on it.

[02:24:14.610 --> 02:24:15.970]
Oh, I don't see no guys there.

[02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:18.210]
Well, maybe I saw a little something slipping there.

[02:24:18.290 --> 02:24:19.750]
Oh, oh, yeah.

[02:24:21.130 --> 02:24:22.130]
Maybe it's just raining.

[02:24:22.290 --> 02:24:22.530]
Gorgeous.

[02:24:22.530 --> 02:24:23.530]
Or it's me where that came from.

[02:24:24.010 --> 02:24:25.050]
Oh, gee, there's that Peter North.

[02:24:25.170 --> 02:24:25.770]
I didn't see him.

[02:24:26.610 --> 02:24:28.390]
And by the way, he no looks so good anymore either.

[02:24:28.470 --> 02:24:29.670]
But hey, everybody gets old.

[02:24:29.750 --> 02:24:30.550]
That's the way God works.

[02:24:31.110 --> 02:24:32.010]
What did I ever do with it?

[02:24:32.010 --> 02:24:33.610]
Do I have that autograph picture?

[02:24:33.770 --> 02:24:34.490]
I guess I got it at home.

[02:24:34.690 --> 02:24:35.550]
I never brought it in.

[02:24:35.590 --> 02:24:35.930]
Do I?

[02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:37.710]
I brought it to meet the hockey game.

[02:24:37.710 --> 02:24:39.610]
Peter North autographed me personal and close up.

[02:24:39.650 --> 02:24:40.490]
And I think there was a score.

[02:24:40.590 --> 02:24:41.530]
Stay on the photo too.

[02:24:41.890 --> 02:24:42.750]
Open line of Broward.

[02:24:43.390 --> 02:24:44.250]
Open line of Dave.

[02:24:44.250 --> 02:24:44.930]
What in Broward?

[02:24:44.990 --> 02:24:45.890]
Like I said, I beg your pardon?

[02:24:46.790 --> 02:24:47.170]
We have that.

[02:24:47.230 --> 02:24:47.650]
He's for them.

[02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:49.310]
Well, what is Eddie's phone number, by the way?

[02:24:50.050 --> 02:24:51.690]
Well, we've been wondering this for a long time.

[02:24:52.670 --> 02:24:53.230]
What's Eddie's number?

[02:24:53.330 --> 02:24:54.790]
I guess he wants to talk to our audience.

[02:24:55.290 --> 02:24:56.570]
Maybe he's having a party today.

[02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.510]
954.

[02:24:58.350 --> 02:24:58.670]
954.

[02:24:59.290 --> 02:24:59.610]
806.

[02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.550]
806.

[02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:01.370]
442.

[02:25:02.410 --> 02:25:02.850]
423.

[02:25:03.070 --> 02:25:07.030]
That's the idea that for the last 45, 50 years has been a lot.

[02:25:07.030 --> 02:25:07.030]

[02:25:07.470 --> 02:25:09.870]
That's the thing that just screams in coherently.

[02:25:10.410 --> 02:25:14.810]
Oh, either or both of the above, depending on which movies in which tranquilizer he's taking

[02:25:14.810 --> 02:25:15.490]
on a given day.

[02:25:16.990 --> 02:25:17.430]
954.

[02:25:17.710 --> 02:25:18.150]
806.

[02:25:18.850 --> 02:25:19.290]
4423.

[02:25:19.690 --> 02:25:20.970]
Maybe you want to call him and say hi.

[02:25:23.290 --> 02:25:23.730]
806.

[02:25:24.330 --> 02:25:24.770]
4423.

[02:25:24.770 --> 02:25:25.870]
That's the number to keep in mind.

[02:25:27.070 --> 02:25:27.930]
Keep him busy.

[02:25:27.930 --> 02:25:29.490]
Open line at Broward.

[02:25:30.470 --> 02:25:33.810]
56670560 and 0.560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:25:34.530 --> 02:25:35.970]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:25:36.130 --> 02:25:36.270]
Hello.

[02:25:36.830 --> 02:25:37.450]
Hey, Neil.

[02:25:37.770 --> 02:25:38.130]
Yes, sir.

[02:25:39.370 --> 02:25:40.930]
About Linda Tripp.

[02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:43.050]
Her going around.

[02:25:43.330 --> 02:25:43.890]
Yeah.

[02:25:44.770 --> 02:25:48.110]
Her going around in the talk show circuit or whatever.

[02:25:48.290 --> 02:25:52.030]
Just proves that any publicity is good publicity.

[02:25:52.310 --> 02:25:54.470]
She doesn't care how bad she looks.

[02:25:54.670 --> 02:25:56.750]
She is going to pay for the so bad.

[02:25:57.750 --> 02:26:00.630]
People are just going to make fun of her 10 times more than ever.

[02:26:01.150 --> 02:26:01.850]
But you don't understand.

[02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:04.430]
By now, she's probably immune to the making fun of.

[02:26:04.530 --> 02:26:05.950]
I mean, that's all an act on her part.

[02:26:06.270 --> 02:26:07.430]
She's going to be writing books.

[02:26:07.790 --> 02:26:08.750]
She's going to be on movies.

[02:26:09.650 --> 02:26:11.250]
I mean, I'm telling you all of these people.

[02:26:11.270 --> 02:26:14.410]
It's going to be another new cottage industry spawned by this insanity.

[02:26:14.570 --> 02:26:15.290]
You mark my words.

[02:26:15.650 --> 02:26:16.130]
That's true.

[02:26:16.470 --> 02:26:17.690]
About another thing, though.

[02:26:18.550 --> 02:26:19.110]
Jerry Falwell.

[02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:22.310]
I've never agreed with him on anything except for one thing.

[02:26:22.430 --> 02:26:22.610]
Yeah.

[02:26:22.610 --> 02:26:24.050]
Tell it to be creepy.

[02:26:24.710 --> 02:26:25.270]
Very creepy.

[02:26:26.430 --> 02:26:26.830]
Yeah.

[02:26:27.290 --> 02:26:28.090]
Well, I'm just saying.

[02:26:28.250 --> 02:26:30.290]
I mean, I find myself agreeing with him.

[02:26:31.250 --> 02:26:32.570]
And I agree with him about what?

[02:26:32.690 --> 02:26:38.070]
That the tell it to be gay, a plot part of a plot to convert our children.

[02:26:38.250 --> 02:26:38.790]
Is that it?

[02:26:38.970 --> 02:26:40.550]
Well, they're creepy enough to be.

[02:26:40.830 --> 02:26:41.010]
Maybe.

[02:26:41.410 --> 02:26:42.430]
Creepy enough to be gay.

[02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:44.590]
No, no.

[02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:45.330]
Okay, thank you.

[02:26:45.490 --> 02:26:45.610]
Okay.

[02:26:47.470 --> 02:26:47.870]
Creepy.

[02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:49.330]
That's going to be my autobiography.

[02:26:49.470 --> 02:26:50.250]
Creepy is that one to be.

[02:26:51.290 --> 02:26:52.110]
How do you like that?

[02:26:52.370 --> 02:26:52.590]
Creepy.

[02:26:52.590 --> 02:26:53.690]
Creepy enough to be a little faggot.

[02:26:54.190 --> 02:26:56.130]
We have an open line of days five six seven.

[02:26:56.310 --> 02:26:57.290]
I mean, I got to tell us.

[02:26:57.410 --> 02:26:57.910]
I'll be right here.

[02:26:58.070 --> 02:26:59.310]
I got winky, winky right here.

[02:26:59.670 --> 02:27:01.810]
I got my winky, dinky in my hand or tinky winky.

[02:27:01.950 --> 02:27:02.230]
I'm sorry.

[02:27:03.490 --> 02:27:04.510]
And it don't look.

[02:27:04.750 --> 02:27:06.510]
It's just a stupid little dollars.

[02:27:06.730 --> 02:27:07.070]
What it is.

[02:27:07.210 --> 02:27:07.930]
I mean, really dumb.

[02:27:09.270 --> 02:27:09.770]
It's not.

[02:27:10.050 --> 02:27:10.710]
It's not anything.

[02:27:10.810 --> 02:27:12.310]
It's just a stupid little little yard of dollars.

[02:27:12.470 --> 02:27:13.210]
If you like it, you like it.

[02:27:13.250 --> 02:27:15.210]
And if if you do, there's probably something wrong with it.

[02:27:17.450 --> 02:27:19.110]
So we'll see you at the bathhouse tonight, sir.

[02:27:20.130 --> 02:27:20.670]
Here's Miami.

[02:27:20.830 --> 02:27:21.030]
Hello.

[02:27:21.030 --> 02:27:21.670]
Neil.

[02:27:21.930 --> 02:27:22.290]
Yes, sir.

[02:27:22.510 --> 02:27:24.190]
I'll give you some comments on Pecker Gate.

[02:27:24.510 --> 02:27:24.670]
Yes.

[02:27:25.210 --> 02:27:26.590]
First of all, thank God it's over.

[02:27:27.770 --> 02:27:33.210]
Second of all, you know, this whole impeachment thing and whether it was guiltier or not, it

[02:27:33.210 --> 02:27:34.930]
was really a big smoke screen.

[02:27:35.130 --> 02:27:38.730]
And it just goes to show how most Americans had their heads buried in the sand.

[02:27:39.010 --> 02:27:39.150]
Correct.

[02:27:39.270 --> 02:27:45.970]
The real story and what scares me to death and what scares me to fear what I think from my children

[02:27:45.970 --> 02:27:51.010]
in the future on the special prosecutorial powers of men like Kenneth St.

[02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:52.370]
and the justice.

[02:27:52.370 --> 02:27:54.530]
Well, thank God that that, okay, independent.

[02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:56.950]
And I'm going to come up very.

[02:27:57.070 --> 02:28:01.010]
So I think in April, this spring, it's coming up and the odds are that they're going to kill

[02:28:01.010 --> 02:28:01.150]
it.

[02:28:01.230 --> 02:28:01.870]
That's not going to be new.

[02:28:02.030 --> 02:28:05.970]
If that isn't up basically what they're doing in the base of the time.

[02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:11.670]
They're giving men unlimited powers and unlimited finances to go and persecute, not prosecute,

[02:28:11.690 --> 02:28:12.950]
but persecute anybody he decides.

[02:28:13.150 --> 02:28:18.130]
And if that isn't a shining example, as to what you always talk about is the rising police

[02:28:18.130 --> 02:28:19.050]
state in this country.

[02:28:19.070 --> 02:28:20.370]
I don't know what the hell is.

[02:28:20.430 --> 02:28:20.830]
That's right.

[02:28:21.370 --> 02:28:21.870]
I'm out.

[02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:23.350]
Ken Star in jail.

[02:28:23.350 --> 02:28:24.050]
That's what I say.

[02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:25.250]
That would make me happy, okay?

[02:28:25.330 --> 02:28:26.750]
I like this crap is all over.

[02:28:26.850 --> 02:28:30.530]
But let's just finish it off like the frosting on the cake, like the icing, the topping.

[02:28:30.930 --> 02:28:32.250]
I throw on his ass on death row.

[02:28:34.990 --> 02:28:35.350]
Unbelievable.

[02:28:36.030 --> 02:28:37.410]
Just a man gone berserk.

[02:28:37.550 --> 02:28:41.330]
And of course, when you read about the Richard Mellon scape connection in the tobacco company,

[02:28:41.530 --> 02:28:44.770]
all the other, the forces behind it makes you realize what it's all about.

[02:28:44.770 --> 02:28:46.450]
Most people can't be bothered with it.

[02:28:46.450 --> 02:28:48.530]
And let's back to the beginning at this point.

[02:28:50.670 --> 02:28:52.410]
Here's a lady mobile in West Palm Beach.

[02:28:52.690 --> 02:28:52.690]

[02:28:53.070 --> 02:28:53.510]
Hi, DL.

[02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:53.890]
How are you?

[02:28:54.050 --> 02:28:54.330]
Great.

[02:28:54.690 --> 02:28:56.030]
This is the other one of the 20.

[02:28:56.510 --> 02:28:57.410]
I love you to death.

[02:28:57.870 --> 02:29:02.830]
Hey, I keep thinking about, hey, baby, complete my long for, never that long you had.

[02:29:02.970 --> 02:29:03.410]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:03.930]
You played it.

[02:29:04.970 --> 02:29:06.710]
I would love to hear that it's possible.

[02:29:07.010 --> 02:29:10.010]
Also too, what you're saying about is our rights being taken away.

[02:29:10.330 --> 02:29:11.290]
It is so true.

[02:29:11.690 --> 02:29:15.050]
When we have to start taking a stand, and that is going to be one of my deals in life.

[02:29:15.050 --> 02:29:15.950]
I just take a stand.

[02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:17.370]
If I want to smoke, I'm going to smoke.

[02:29:17.750 --> 02:29:18.250]
I want to start.

[02:29:18.450 --> 02:29:18.970]
I'm going to start.

[02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:19.890]
I'm going to do it.

[02:29:19.990 --> 02:29:19.990]

[02:29:20.250 --> 02:29:21.510]
Because that's the way it should be.

[02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:22.070]
You want to see a good one?

[02:29:22.350 --> 02:29:22.750]
That's your business.

[02:29:23.150 --> 02:29:23.450]
Exactly.

[02:29:23.650 --> 02:29:26.470]
We saw Staten Private Ryan here the night, and let me tell you something.

[02:29:26.910 --> 02:29:31.470]
If those guys fought and died for us for that reason, and then Civil War and every other wars like that,

[02:29:31.650 --> 02:29:33.310]
then we then stand up for them too.

[02:29:33.670 --> 02:29:38.210]
That's why we got the rights and freedoms that are being taken away from us right now.

[02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:39.570]
We have to go back.

[02:29:39.950 --> 02:29:42.510]
We have to stand up for those freedoms and those rights.

[02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:44.330]
If not, we're not going to have any.

[02:29:44.330 --> 02:29:45.270]
Okay, sweetheart.

[02:29:45.550 --> 02:29:46.250]
Lucky baby.

[02:29:46.370 --> 02:29:47.250]
Okay, see ya.

[02:29:47.910 --> 02:29:48.990]
Don't step on it.

[02:29:49.330 --> 02:29:50.550]
Hey, baby.

[02:29:50.910 --> 02:29:52.210]
Come play with my sloth.

[02:29:52.770 --> 02:29:55.850]
It may be hangin' down with you, it may be big at all.

[02:29:56.530 --> 02:29:57.730]
Hey, baby.

[02:29:58.070 --> 02:29:59.350]
Come play with my sloth.

[02:30:00.030 --> 02:30:01.250]
You don't have the swallow.

[02:30:01.750 --> 02:30:03.230]
I have a washcloth.

[02:30:03.770 --> 02:30:06.670]
Aim and deflease as you're going down on me.

[02:30:07.210 --> 02:30:09.330]
Oh, yeah.

[02:30:10.610 --> 02:30:12.230]
Where is his outer back?

[02:30:12.650 --> 02:30:13.730]
On your knees.

[02:30:15.310 --> 02:30:15.950]
Shoo.

[02:30:17.610 --> 02:30:20.250]
You can't fall for a moment, do you?

[02:30:21.050 --> 02:30:22.570]
Well, here I come.

[02:30:23.170 --> 02:30:24.590]
You're up with the blues.

[02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:28.570]
Oh, yeah.

[02:30:29.470 --> 02:30:31.590]
Oh, my baby.

[02:30:32.250 --> 02:30:34.230]
You can't even hear me out.

[02:30:34.570 --> 02:30:35.690]
I'll play with my sloth.

[02:30:36.190 --> 02:30:37.350]
Who's your daddy now?

[02:30:37.690 --> 02:30:38.750]
Baby, baby.

[02:30:39.090 --> 02:30:40.350]
Hey, baby.

[02:30:40.570 --> 02:30:41.210]
You can't fall.

[02:30:41.690 --> 02:30:42.150]
No, baby.

[02:30:43.670 --> 02:30:45.630]
What's 25 at 560 WQM?

[02:30:45.630 --> 02:30:46.730]
I mean, we all know you're full of crap.

[02:30:46.850 --> 02:30:50.190]
George thinks he knows something about sex, but actually, he really hasn't had any yet.

[02:30:50.370 --> 02:30:51.650]
I wanted to feel with all your fantasy.

[02:30:52.350 --> 02:30:54.150]
Friday, you last bit.

[02:31:02.390 --> 02:31:07.090]
A young man turns 28.

[02:31:07.370 --> 02:31:07.690]
Okay.

[02:31:08.050 --> 02:31:10.270]
He scored the sweetest bag.

[02:31:11.270 --> 02:31:12.930]
I'll go on the next day.

[02:31:13.090 --> 02:31:13.690]
All right.

[02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:16.350]
It's too many seeds.

[02:31:16.970 --> 02:31:18.890]
In your dime bag.

[02:31:20.270 --> 02:31:21.610]
Getting to the party.

[02:31:22.610 --> 02:31:23.850]
Two minutes too late.

[02:31:24.910 --> 02:31:25.950]
Isn't it the chronic?

[02:31:26.370 --> 02:31:26.590]
Yes.

[02:31:27.630 --> 02:31:28.730]
Don't you think?

[02:31:29.810 --> 02:31:31.110]
It's not great.

[02:31:33.190 --> 02:31:35.550]
When you've left on break.

[02:31:35.550 --> 02:31:37.450]
The free bag.

[02:31:39.310 --> 02:31:41.310]
When you're already baked.

[02:31:42.130 --> 02:31:44.730]
You'll believe us.

[02:31:45.130 --> 02:31:46.930]
That's you tested and you say.

[02:31:48.030 --> 02:31:51.070]
Who are the thoughts you get?

[02:31:53.430 --> 02:31:55.250]
Hard, brownie.

[02:31:56.210 --> 02:31:57.750]
That you already ate.

[02:31:58.690 --> 02:31:59.230]
I know.

[02:31:59.690 --> 02:32:01.130]
Don't it sign.

[02:32:02.170 --> 02:32:03.850]
A lot that you've raised.

[02:32:04.850 --> 02:32:06.970]
It's like 10,000 joins.

[02:32:07.430 --> 02:32:09.650]
When all you need is a light.

[02:32:10.130 --> 02:32:12.430]
It's like having a fever of dreams.

[02:32:13.230 --> 02:32:15.510]
And then finding out it's not 10's of light.

[02:32:16.890 --> 02:32:18.410]
And here's only the chronic.

[02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:21.170]
Don't you think?

[02:32:21.410 --> 02:32:21.670]
Yes.

[02:32:22.410 --> 02:32:24.750]
A little too much chronic.

[02:32:25.750 --> 02:32:27.570]
Yeah, I really do think.

[02:32:28.190 --> 02:32:29.290]
It's not great.

[02:32:29.290 --> 02:32:29.550]
Yeah.

[02:32:31.610 --> 02:32:33.710]
When you've left on break.

[02:32:34.370 --> 02:32:35.610]
The free bag.

[02:32:37.390 --> 02:32:39.730]
When you're already baked.

[02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:45.190]
That's you tested and you say.

[02:32:46.590 --> 02:32:49.230]
Who are the thoughts you get?

[02:32:50.650 --> 02:32:52.130]
I just had a great idea for our own TV show.

[02:32:52.230 --> 02:32:53.550]
I'll send you more in with you, Ray Falwell.

[02:32:53.710 --> 02:32:55.190]
That's still the not whole, you know, grudges.

[02:32:55.810 --> 02:32:56.670]
Tell us, chubbies.

[02:32:57.410 --> 02:33:11.250]
Huh? I could be honest. We were talking about that at the beginning of the show. This morning, all the fat people around here me and Booge and Hank and the beast, the Will the Beast and the fat boy Jeff high and your favorite Josh Friedman who is really a monster in the business.

[02:33:12.050 --> 02:33:12.570]
Who are we from?

[02:33:13.530 --> 02:33:28.930]
Jeff DeForetsdipho is getting really hylando. Orlando, he's a monster engineer, who is also an engineering broker. Lots of fat around this joint. So I think we got to join forces with jury. And as long as I don't wear my purple shirt, I think it'll be okay.

[02:33:30.350 --> 02:33:34.630]
Tell us, hubby. Here's Poppato Beach. How you doing now?

[02:33:34.630 --> 02:33:42.430]
Great. I just want to thank you for your commentary during the vote. But I got a question. What was all inspectors vote about not proven?

[02:33:42.910 --> 02:34:01.550]
Yeah, our own specter. He's always got to be off on his own thing like that magic bullet theory and the Warren Commission report, the bullet went over here and it went over there and then it wound up on the stretcher and don't confuse him with the fact. So we got a hundred guys in there. They all are abiding by the rules. It's yay or they guilty or not guilty in this case. And he had not proven.

[02:34:01.550 --> 02:34:09.810]
You know, and like they all all stopped the first time. He did like everything came to a halt like, huh? Like what are we doing now? You know, and they finally said, okay, he's an asshole. He means not guilty.

[02:34:10.110 --> 02:34:19.230]
And you know, it's interesting though that Fred Thompson voting innocent. I'm the first one. I almost fell off the chair. I nearly got to an action or the wheel at the time.

[02:34:20.170 --> 02:34:26.970]
Because I think I already pressed and then I had a quick added put my finger on it. I got a joke for you, Neil. Okay, have a great day.

[02:34:28.290 --> 02:34:37.030]
Okay, we have an open line. He was a good call up to them. We just don't do jokes. Just a reminder for the audience. Okay, we don't do jokes because radio shows are the colors call in new jokes. Those shows really.

[02:34:38.570 --> 02:34:46.770]
Blow five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60. You see, I don't care what any right winger on the radio, whether it's Laura S. Linbaugh, no matter who it is.

[02:34:47.290 --> 02:34:53.230]
I don't care what they tell you because they're obviously pandering to a certain mentality, a certain constituency that they've developed over the years.

[02:34:53.230 --> 02:35:03.010]
I don't care what they say. There aren't 50 people in this country who really believe that Clinton did anything that anybody else wouldn't do. His political enemies are out to corner him.

[02:35:03.290 --> 02:35:10.610]
They're spending unlimited amounts of funds millions and millions of millions with as many acquies been put in there by right wing forces to get him out of there to destroy him.

[02:35:11.810 --> 02:35:17.950]
They can't get him on anything meaningful so they can they know of course he's a hormonger so they catch him on sexual pecker dillows.

[02:35:19.090 --> 02:35:23.610]
And they put him in a position where you know he has to lie about it.

[02:35:24.110 --> 02:35:29.850]
And another thing you see another big problem is we got a lot of dumb people out there who don't know the difference between projury and lying.

[02:35:30.210 --> 02:35:34.410]
They don't know the difference lying under oath is not perjury necessarily.

[02:35:35.550 --> 02:35:38.990]
But even if a word nobody should still care but they just don't get it.

[02:35:40.450 --> 02:35:47.530]
But let me say it again there aren't 30 people in the whole country even though self proclaimed religion is so our school and everything that moves people like Henry Hyde.

[02:35:47.610 --> 02:35:50.130]
How's that marriage coming by the way that he busted up in West.

[02:35:51.610 --> 02:35:57.150]
They don't care. They don't think there was anything immoral or grotesque. In fact most of them which they were getting as much action as he's been.

[02:35:58.070 --> 02:36:07.750]
Just think back to that piece that was on 60 minutes long before we got to this impeachment stage where they talk when they showed him in the Vernon Jordan riding around on the golf cart on the course.

[02:36:08.830 --> 02:36:13.610]
Mike Wallace did the piece and what is the president what do they talk about when they're out there together they talk about.

[02:36:13.990 --> 02:36:14.390]
Okay.

[02:36:16.930 --> 02:36:20.070]
And we're not talking about spot the cat either buddy.

[02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:24.470]
Here's a mobile in Fort Myers hello.

[02:36:25.170 --> 02:36:25.870]
Yes sir.

[02:36:28.110 --> 02:36:30.870]
I respect any woman they could talk about for it like that last one.

[02:36:32.110 --> 02:36:34.870]
But anyway, the only woman in this town who admits to it.

[02:36:34.870 --> 02:36:36.910]
I know that's cool. I give you her number.

[02:36:37.090 --> 02:36:38.850]
Just don't want to be too close to this thing.

[02:36:38.950 --> 02:36:42.530]
But I wanted to mention about the sector guy. All of a sudden he just changed his mind.

[02:36:42.670 --> 02:36:46.410]
He was like 60s like oh you know I didn't want the president to get him to teach you.

[02:36:47.030 --> 02:36:48.630]
Before I was like yeah let's go get him.

[02:36:48.750 --> 02:36:53.030]
Yeah he was really aggressive and all of a sudden yesterday came out and said I don't know.

[02:36:53.250 --> 02:36:58.870]
Yeah you know it's like what I would do that.

[02:36:58.870 --> 02:37:00.610]
And that's Richard Parkville Hospital in Dallas.

[02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:01.050]
Yeah.

[02:37:01.770 --> 02:37:04.350]
All right with some of we down in Fort Myers to Fort Illinois.

[02:37:05.970 --> 02:37:06.870]
Okay I have a good time.

[02:37:08.730 --> 02:37:11.690]
I bet you they do have real good weed over there in Fort Myers huh.

[02:37:11.850 --> 02:37:12.230]
You think so?

[02:37:12.370 --> 02:37:13.950]
You probably leave everybody alone too.

[02:37:14.290 --> 02:37:16.390]
In fact, Parker's probably coming in here and smoke it with him.

[02:37:17.470 --> 02:37:22.730]
We have an open line at date 5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:37:22.830 --> 02:37:25.970]
Hank Goldberg at 2 Kim Bocapp or at 6 Ed Kaplan.

[02:37:25.970 --> 02:37:27.890]
You can bet on it 10 o'clock tonight.

[02:37:28.670 --> 02:37:30.810]
Speaking of you can bet I guess I'll save this from Monday.

[02:37:31.210 --> 02:37:34.290]
The thing about the new satellite dish with all the racing channels on it.

[02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:35.410]
The host racing.

[02:37:36.370 --> 02:37:39.330]
Which in fact Derek and I were just talking about that the track last night.

[02:37:39.450 --> 02:37:41.270]
They could open up really bad avenues.

[02:37:41.490 --> 02:37:45.110]
They've already got that on a small dish on Fox Pittsburgh 315.

[02:37:45.890 --> 02:37:48.950]
We're doing the daytime and they have that what they call it teletrack.

[02:37:49.630 --> 02:37:50.950]
You call a one-handed number.

[02:37:51.030 --> 02:37:53.990]
Open it count with your credit card and you can bet on all.

[02:37:55.070 --> 02:37:55.930]
All these races.

[02:37:57.650 --> 02:38:06.910]
Freehold harness racing and the thoroughbred Belmont and all after the long you can sit there in your home and as long as you got money in your account and that credit card you can pledge your brains out.

[02:38:07.810 --> 02:38:11.530]
The potential for that as much as I love the track and as much as I'm not a non gambling.

[02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:17.210]
You know I'm not an anti gambling nut but the potential for that can you see that that's what they ought to get up here.

[02:38:17.850 --> 02:38:21.310]
Now that they got the dish up there get channel 315 going for the guys.

[02:38:22.430 --> 02:38:28.570]
By the end of the month there'll be like a half a dozen guys standing out on the corner of 441 I was very bored with a 10 cup with their thumbs out.

[02:38:29.330 --> 02:38:29.970]
That's right.

[02:38:31.270 --> 02:38:33.710]
23 before 2 at 560 QA.

[02:38:33.850 --> 02:38:36.130]
If you're it's worth the large and in the basket.

[02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:39.990]
Hey kids are you tired of that neighborhood bully?

[02:38:40.270 --> 02:38:42.110]
He stole my lunch money.

[02:38:42.550 --> 02:38:46.110]
Shut up kid and tell him want to hold the mail next time.

[02:38:46.370 --> 02:38:47.770]
Next time fight back.

[02:38:47.970 --> 02:38:49.510]
But he's bigger than me.

[02:38:49.510 --> 02:38:57.550]
No no no just tell mom next time she hits the candy aisle at the grocery store pick up a pack of new shit cab candy bars.

[02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:58.230]
Shut up.

[02:38:58.630 --> 02:39:05.330]
Yes it's a new candy bar made entirely from recycled cow dung guaranteed to turn your stomach.

[02:39:05.770 --> 02:39:06.850]
So next time.

[02:39:07.170 --> 02:39:09.110]
Alright kid give me a lunch.

[02:39:09.270 --> 02:39:12.150]
No no please don't take it.

[02:39:12.310 --> 02:39:14.090]
Shut shut up and hand it over.

[02:39:14.090 --> 02:39:16.390]
Okay here you go.

[02:39:16.610 --> 02:39:20.710]
But whatever you do please don't eat my candy bar.

[02:39:22.250 --> 02:39:23.770]
Hey cool.

[02:39:27.090 --> 02:39:29.550]
Ah this tastes like shut.

[02:39:30.110 --> 02:39:33.070]
So you want my lunch tomorrow too?

[02:39:33.710 --> 02:39:39.170]
We got a hunch you got a little lunch when you take a bite of that chest gas bar.

[02:39:39.170 --> 02:39:49.090]
Okay it's 142.560 WQM thanks to my good friend Chuck for bringing me a great combo chef salad here today without the excess spicy hot onions from the end of the day.

[02:39:49.270 --> 02:39:51.590]
Woo that was good but like bird to hole in my public.

[02:39:52.170 --> 02:39:57.130]
But at any rate so Ted Kennedy was just on there up pontificating they had some crazy bitch on there.

[02:39:58.290 --> 02:40:02.970]
Behind him with a big sign it said Clinton is evil and she was screaming and swearing up the storm saying.

[02:40:02.970 --> 02:40:03.810]
What the hell are you?

[02:40:04.450 --> 02:40:12.230]
And then Bernie Shaw on CNN finally said well I guess we better dump out of this right now for the quorum sake so too bad we didn't get a chance to hear what he had to say.

[02:40:12.250 --> 02:40:17.750]
Oh man a lot of really hysterical crap no doubt.

[02:40:18.150 --> 02:40:22.130]
Well they just can't handle you know Clinton is evil and he's getting more jobs.

[02:40:23.710 --> 02:40:32.950]
Wow see you know this was a colossal waste of time in most ways but but it did bear out what I've been telling you for many many years.

[02:40:32.950 --> 02:40:42.250]
And that this country compared to like civilized places in the world where I've been to many of them is so juvenile and so much in the stone age and so backward and so uptight and so hypocritical.

[02:40:42.750 --> 02:40:48.370]
And maybe people are going to start understanding that now it's not just something some nutcase on the radio is saying down here in Miami.

[02:40:51.090 --> 02:41:02.930]
Juvenile hypocritical full of crap uptight sexually paranoid puritanical obsessed with my new shy upset and of course voyeuristic as well naturally we've got to look at everybody's bedroom and see who's putting their own eyes on it.

[02:41:02.930 --> 02:41:18.730]
We have an open line and Broward to and date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18th okay cute okay two open lines in Broward five six seven oh five 60 and pound five 60 on it see if he would have had better alliteration we could left that on there.

[02:41:19.910 --> 02:41:31.770]
But you couldn't tell whether it was an S or an F as in okay let's try a candle hello hello Niel yes I'm not a huge maple leaf fan but I will be watching Saturday and that's game for the closing of the garden.

[02:41:31.770 --> 02:41:42.470]
Yes sir early early start by the way six o'clock free game six thirty tomorrow night I don't have big extravagance after the game I don't have the dish but I have to watch them the do's.

[02:41:43.130 --> 02:41:51.750]
It's on the do's I think so oh great well thank you for the matter doors tickets a couple of weeks ago but all by the way the article I'm off you saw the paper they but it's the

[02:41:51.750 --> 02:41:59.730]
matter doors it looks like they're going to be selling them and it's not making it here and they're urging about a thousand people to game that you got yourself a sniper down in town here

[02:41:59.730 --> 02:42:08.610]
get a world yeah he's he's doing it one more thing palvobury he puts the biscuit in the basket okay two open lines in date they're out of

[02:42:08.610 --> 02:42:16.350]
material all of a sudden five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18th wireless line how sad that all of a sudden just when my lunch

[02:42:16.350 --> 02:42:24.930]
shows up they all were not a material should have known it especially especially on the ass end of this week and you know something and just

[02:42:24.930 --> 02:42:31.270]
on me did that bitch call back today when they invited I usually don't invite people to call me especially if they're ordering up

[02:42:31.270 --> 02:42:39.790]
not just like she was but because I was so curious why anybody in her right mind in its right mind would waste their time

[02:42:39.790 --> 02:42:44.370]
calling and giving me a lot oh you don't take criticism and you're a how would want to be in your piece of

[02:42:44.370 --> 02:42:50.050]
track and whatever she was a screaming is today then try to call back a second time like an hour and a half later so

[02:42:50.050 --> 02:42:56.690]
obviously she was still listening I could be doing this for another 500 years God forbid and I still would never

[02:42:56.690 --> 02:43:03.690]
understand why people subject themselves to something that they don't like unless unless there's a part of them

[02:43:03.690 --> 02:43:14.230]
like I've told you many times before knowing at them in the back of their little tiny brain that says well you know

[02:43:14.230 --> 02:43:20.610]
with it but she's probably a diddle him with her little teletubby right now here's for lauderdale hello

[02:43:21.150 --> 02:43:30.130]
Neil you speak to the truth yes card carrying member of trapeos 2 really yes and fortunately I wasn't there to be busted

[02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:37.450]
but I find it to be disgusting I mean you know when I was a kid growing up I was always told that this is a great

[02:43:37.450 --> 02:43:43.030]
country where freedom reign oh yeah you only reigns is like the rain in spain falls mainly on your

[02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:49.930]
rena's yeah you can't have sex with consenting adults anymore in a legally licensed private place you can't gamble on

[02:43:49.930 --> 02:43:54.570]
a legally licensed gaming vessel right you can't even flash your headlights going down the road if there's a

[02:43:54.570 --> 02:43:59.450]
copy that's right there you go because it's a police date like I've been telling you we you know we need to do

[02:43:59.450 --> 02:44:05.790]
no we need to legalize freedom in this country uh-huh and then closing I got a new slogan for American Airlines if we

[02:44:05.790 --> 02:44:11.110]

[02:44:11.110 --> 02:44:16.350]

[02:44:16.350 --> 02:44:24.450]
laid oh you can't do that this is America yeah you're right you can't do that oh my god it's just like I

[02:44:24.450 --> 02:44:29.530]
said an extraordinary waste of energy and money people are starving that kids are getting crappy

[02:44:29.530 --> 02:44:36.610]
education people are illiterate and we're spending money about blow jobs in line about blow jobs

[02:44:36.610 --> 02:44:44.310]
and was the stain to the DNA evidence match and uh oh on and on and on and a bunch of sanctimonious

[02:44:44.310 --> 02:44:50.590]
asshole talking heads on their hour after hour day after day of our freaking lives thank god at least

[02:44:50.590 --> 02:44:58.090]
that part of it is over thank god tg.io baby thank god it's over oh christ

[02:45:23.690 --> 02:45:27.950]
i'm gonna have to kill two at five sixty qm your happy station for the nineties is your

[02:45:27.950 --> 02:45:50.050]
best good

[02:45:54.670 --> 02:46:00.370]
We have been a little reluctant to play that anymore because it's got the line about the sheriff who's obscene and it was always about sheriff Nick the bar

[02:46:00.370 --> 02:46:01.690]
But now we got sheriff Ken Jenny

[02:46:01.690 --> 02:46:02.770]
Howard County

[02:46:03.350 --> 02:46:08.250]
So it doesn't make any difference whether it's a stack Bobby Butterworth, Nick Navarro or Ken Jenny
