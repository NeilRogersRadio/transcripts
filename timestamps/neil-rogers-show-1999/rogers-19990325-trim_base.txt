[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]
Sports Radio 560 WQAM Miami Ford Lauderdale presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.260]
Hey, it's a tutorial called 560 560 toll free for date and brower.

[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.620]
Or pound 560 on your cell phone.

[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.120]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show do not necessarily reflect those of WQAM

[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.300]
easily read acquisitions or the beastly broadcast room.

[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.380]
Now, Neil Rogers on Sports Radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.160]
See, this is my theory like with Neil Rogers also.

[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.900]
It's the kind of thing like if you throw a ball at him, he runs the other way.

[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.440]
If you shot a hockey puck in Neil Rogers, he'd be running now 441 the other way.

[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.540]
Neil used to kind of tools of ignorance and he was a catcher in minor league baseball and he could have gone pro.

[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.100]
He decided to do radio.

[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.660]
Actually, it's probably been more profitable.

[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.720]
Go be high football ball.

[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.020]
Hey, that's a good looking guy.

[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.180]
Hey, that's a good looking guy.

[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.520]
One more thing.

[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.860]
Hey, that's a good looking guy.

[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.960]
Thank you.

[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.140]
All right.

[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.440]
Am I queer?

[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.960]
People stop and stay away when we are near.

[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.200]
Yes.

[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.020]
For more fear, we're just living life.

[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.320]
The way we want to.

[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.760]
Hey, that's a good looking guy.

[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.260]
It's tough on Jay.

[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.700]
And that is all what people say those nasty, nasty things they do.

[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.360]
It's because I'm Jay.

[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.400]
And that is all.

[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.080]
It's just something they can't approve.

[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.040]
Swimming, screaming, dressed up all in trash.

[00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.300]
That's a good looking guy.

[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.200]
It's so sad.

[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.260]
They're the ones that make up all the bad.

[00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.180]
Also bad.

[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.000]
We're just living life.

[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.400]
The way we want to.

[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.460]
Yes.

[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.320]
It's tough on Jay.

[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.340]
And that is all.

[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.240]
It's why they say those nasty things they do.

[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.040]
It's because I'm Jay.

[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.040]
And that is all.

[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.480]
But it can be so hard.

[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.140]
Inside you.

[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.580]
Only so.

[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.780]
So hard.

[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.360]
Inside you.

[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.300]
Inside you.

[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.480]
Hey, that's a good looking guy.

[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.340]
Squared, scored.

[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.260]
10-03 at 5-60 WQM.

[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.360]
Happy Thursday to you.

[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.200]
Thank God we finally made it to Thursday.

[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.940]
Every day this week I thought was Thursday.

[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.820]
And we finally made it to the spirit.

[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.660]
You know, I'm coming to work this morning listening to Marvin and Tammy.

[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.140]
Marvin gave that is.

[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.000]
Well, it's been a yesterday that show went over very big.

[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.100]
I had rave reviews from everybody.

[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.960]
In fact, they liked to show yesterday better than the hockey game last night.

[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.060]
I'm talking about the people at the Macarena last night.

[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.520]
Most of us hated that game.

[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.440]
Oh God, that was painful.

[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.980]
But they loved that show.

[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.920]
And I did leave out one very glaring category,

[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.460]
which I will touch on in a minute or two.

[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.720]
So I'm coming to work this morning.

[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.800]
I'm listening to Marvin and Tammy Torell.

[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.020]
And then, you know, I've heard all the songs I want to hear.

[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.500]
And I'm switching the CDs.

[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.540]
I'm about to pop the backdoor boys into my CD player.

[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.600]
And all of a sudden, you know, you pull out the one CD

[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.460]
and you get ready to put them.

[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.380]
The radio comes on.

[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.080]
And I hear some misfit, who's obviously listening right now, by the way.

[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.080]
See, when things get really desperate, you know,

[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.400]
when they force you to do 45 minutes of spots in hour,

[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.640]
and there's nobody calling and things are getting really deadly,

[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.040]
but all the stations like in the phone is in the crapper.

[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.200]
I heard you, he Hank yesterday crying like a child about the phone.

[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.420]
And rightfully so, carrying on unbelievably.

[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.660]
So you have to start trying with a contrived controversy, you know?

[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.700]
I mean, in Gelti, try this a few weeks ago.

[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.220]
Did it work?

[00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.480]
No.

[00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.820]
No.

[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.920]
Is it going to work this time?

[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.300]
No.

[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.640]
No.

[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.900]
And this right on the heels of yesterday,

[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.720]
what I actually said in this asshole Ojopravakutur,

[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.580]
who called this morning the one that I heard,

[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.440]
who's listening now and listens to every minute of the show

[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.880]
to go chapter and verse of what I say,

[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.800]
even though I am a schmuck.

[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.500]
And that's true.

[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.120]
I am a schmuck for working in this place.

[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.100]
But nevertheless, yesterday, what did I say?

[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.080]
Did I finally say something nice about them?

[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.840]
Well, kind of half nice about the fact that, you know,

[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.460]
Joe and Diffle, I didn't mention what's his name.

[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.660]
Okay, that's a good looking guy.

[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.420]
I didn't mention that.

[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.240]
But I give them credit for at least putting on the appearance of doing a show

[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.900]
where we're running 26 minutes an hour of spots

[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.180]
and the two updates an hour.

[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.320]
There's nothing left.

[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.920]
And I'm still keeping it on the year for another week

[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.080]
until Henry Barrow starts,

[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.400]
which Chuck Meyer next Monday.

[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.880]
I wasn't supposed to mention that.

[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.120]
Isn't Chuck going to be working with Henry Barrow?

[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.240]
Yeah, I'm working on Pee Wee Herman, forget him.

[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.360]
Well, that's what I'm hearing.

[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.340]
Chuck Meyer, the great Chuck Meyer,

[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.360]
what those great phone interviews.

[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.080]
Henry Barrow, Roger Magglin,

[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.020]
Ron Harrison coming in to do the sports.

[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.660]
There's a guy who'll tell you,

[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.520]
he knows nothing about sports,

[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.040]
but he's a fun guy, you know, to be around.

[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.360]
Lives in a keys.

[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.220]
That's going to be the new morning thing.

[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.600]
So I guess they're looking for a scapegoat now

[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.300]
for the fact that they just can't cut it.

[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.760]
And they're going to do contrab controversy.

[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.140]
So this guy's calling it,

[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.100]
yeah, why don't you guys take a poll, huh?

[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.360]
And see, you know,

[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.200]
then the erogers,

[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.920]
everybody can call and say what a schmuckie

[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.880]
is all these terrible things he's saying about the worst team.

[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.920]
And he can find out what's our photo.

[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.860]
Really, he thinks about him.

[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.260]
And Kelly's done,

[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.640]
oh, yeah, he's so thin skinned,

[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.460]
how he's spending all day.

[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.580]
No, I'm not going to spend

[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.820]
more than a couple of minutes on it.

[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.100]
In fact, I wouldn't spend any time at all

[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.660]
until Kelly made that our unbelievable comment.

[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.820]
Hey, that's a good looking guy,

[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.900]
which is starting to get us a lot.

[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.740]
Didn't he just get married?

[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.220]
And I thought,

[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.200]
was getting married or something like that?

[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.300]
Huh?

[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.480]
Kind of a strange thing for a guy.

[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.300]
It's getting married to say.

[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.360]
Hey, that's a good looking guy.

[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.400]
That's a good looking guy.

[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.420]
All right, that was enough.

[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.700]
That voice, that sound.

[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.060]
Yeah, let's see.

[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.140]
The only survey that counts in my mind

[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.340]
as far as what's our photo thinks about me in the show

[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.000]
is the one that comes every month.

[00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.780]
It's called the ratings,

[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.560]
the arbitrage,

[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.860]
the arbitrage on book,

[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.160]
you know, every three months.

[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.500]
Have you looked at those guys?

[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.260]
No.

[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.860]
Probably not.

[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.260]
So I know you're out there.

[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.840]
All you simple sports nerds,

[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.320]
which of course is another Fag Club.

[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.820]
We know that.

[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.100]
We know that you're hanging on every word from the show.

[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.760]
W-Q-A-M.

[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.880]
Yes, I like to get it to speak to Neil Rogers.

[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.440]
Speaking.

[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.620]
Oh, Mr. Rogers.

[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.520]
My name is James.

[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.420]
Yeah, but short show today,

[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.020]
so it's screenless until I was ballgame.

[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.480]
Oh, okay.

[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.920]
Time to pick up the calls.

[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.940]
There aren't too many of them this week

[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.940]
because everybody's getting ready for Passover and Easter.

[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.040]
Oh, that's okay,

[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.240]
but this is something that's going on in the state legislation

[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.140]
that the people don't even know about.

[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.860]
Well, you can't do the right place.

[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.300]
Well, I'm trying to get it.

[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.580]
Tell you what's going on.

[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.500]
Lay it right out there.

[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.400]
I'm trying to.

[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.140]
We have this massive audience out there

[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.220]
just waiting to hear the news.

[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.640]
My name is Jane Hose and I'm an insurance agent.

[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.240]
The state's Betty Hose and Dorf is trying to pass the bill.

[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.520]
Actually murder a bill that we're trying to murder it.

[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.480]
Yeah, but you're it.

[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.280]
Well, she wrote a there is a 1993.

[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.460]
The little child had a bill out there to get guaranteed insurance.

[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.460]
Yes, he did.

[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.780]
Okay.

[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.900]
I just want to make sure you know that.

[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.660]
Wasn't he dead when he was in office too, by the way?

[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.960]
No, he did something very good for the small employee.

[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.680]
Yeah, small employee groups.

[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.520]
One to fifty.

[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.920]
He had a law in 1994.

[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.900]
So guaranteed issue a law.

[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.820]
How do you spell it?

[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.780]
L-A-W-R-L-R-L-R?

[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.400]
Or is that L-O-R-E is in folklore?

[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.500]
You want to hear what's going on?

[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.180]
I'm listening carefully, but I want to make sure we get it done correctly.

[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.200]
I can tell.

[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.720]
It's a law.

[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.180]
A law?

[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.940]
Well, if you want to call it that, that's fine.

[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.900]
That's about.

[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.080]
Taking away guaranteed insurance from employees.

[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.920]
From four years.

[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.000]
Yeah, I've got to wonder another call.

[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.220]
Betty Q.A.M.

[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:43.440]
Hello.

[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:43.980]
Hello?

[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:44.600]
Yes, sir.

[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.220]
Yes.

[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:46.260]
How you doing?

[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.220]
All right, how you doing?

[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:47.600]
Great.

[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.260]
Who's making fun of you on the morning show?

[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.880]
You're a great guy, I love you.

[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.220]
Yeah.

[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.540]
Who has any right to judge?

[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.440]
No, you don't understand.

[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.560]
It's not a question they can fund.

[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.640]
It's a question of their desperate

[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.680]
and they're trying to stir up a bunch of contrabount diversity

[00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.960]
because they can't get any calls.

[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.860]
I say to her, I watch one call coming for about 45 minutes.

[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:03.700]
They're done.

[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.180]
Who's the one saying stuff?

[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:05.900]
Is it Bo Campers?

[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.500]
What is it?

[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.600]
Is it Bo Campers talking?

[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:08.460]
Or is it Fort?

[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:08.980]
The Force?

[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.880]
Yeah, Bo Campers, yeah.

[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:11.720]
Kim Bo.

[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.940]
That guy doesn't know anything about sports.

[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:14.880]
I think it's Gully.

[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.120]
You hear Gully this morning say,

[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.260]
Hey, that's a good looking guy.

[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:17.700]
You hear that?

[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.380]
No, I didn't think Gully's trying.

[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.980]
I think they must have heard on my show yesterday

[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.120]
trying to give us a message.

[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.980]
Well, this guy's about to reach your cost on that show.

[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.180]
Okay, thanks for the good news.

[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.740]
Okay, so I guess we're going to rip them today

[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.280]
and say we're going to do it until the ball game comes down.

[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.300]
I wasn't planning on doing that.

[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.660]
I was hoping to hear about that lore in Tallahassee

[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.420]
that Governor walking, well, Governor

[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.220]
sleeping in the lot and he sleeps with the fishes now.

[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.980]
All right, what was she talking about?

[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.960]
I guess she assumes now.

[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.240]
And now she's not going to like me.

[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.620]
See, I am thin skinned.

[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.560]
She's going to say lots of terrible things about me.

[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.640]
So I cut her off and I was rude.

[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.660]
It was boring lady.

[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.060]
Okay, I don't know what you're talking about.

[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:53.580]
We don't care.

[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.680]
We aren't the least bit interested

[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.820]
in what's going on up there until they find

[00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.480]
the air, of course, this thing with now.

[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.620]
You see they're trying to do the thing

[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.960]
with the vouchers, school vouchers.

[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.840]
I told you about that, Jeb Bois didn't I?

[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.220]
And all those fascists, what they want to do

[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.740]
is just take all the minorities.

[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.820]
I don't want them into which ones

[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.040]
and have the public school just be like a dumping place for them.

[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.380]
And all the people with some money,

[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.520]
they're going to go to these private schools

[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.500]
and parochial schools, these hot tea,

[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.420]
tati, and just destroy public education,

[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.540]
which of course is part of the whole

[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.580]
right wing philosophy.

[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.300]
Not that I want to get into politics,

[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.040]
but what you see is what you get.

[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.000]
So just keep in mind,

[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.960]
when it comes to anything of any consequence,

[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.560]
the Jebster is full of crap.

[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.760]
That don't be picking on the guys in the morning.

[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.900]
I will say this, they're costing the rest of us money.

[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.160]
In fact, I know Hank is probably feeling the same way.

[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.360]
I'm holding up my end of the bargain

[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:40.960]
with those numbers.

[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.140]
Oh, yeah, that's right.

[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.120]
Oh, God.

[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:43.800]
We're doing it.

[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.440]
But a lot of us have secondary bonuses

[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.260]
based on the overall station performance,

[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.420]
men 25 54.

[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.160]
And when certain shows which out of winter

[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.280]
mention which ones they are,

[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.920]
certain shows are biting the big one.

[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.160]
Hey, that's a good looking guy.

[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.460]
Then it costed us all money.

[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.200]
But anyway, yeah, if they want to rip me,

[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.780]
that's fine because I can handle it.

[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.760]
Even the way I'm thin skinned,

[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.280]
by the way, Diffo, I never was a catcher

[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.660]
and I'm not a pull them that in the hallway.

[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.260]
He was out there with his baseball bat again.

[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.440]
He was batting it around.

[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.880]
Getting fat, rhymes with bat.

[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.100]
Ten minutes after 10 at 5.

[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.920]
60 QA and several places was spring train.

[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.020]
I know, but I remember I go back a long way

[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.760]
to when the Yankees first came down here.

[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.040]
And they had trained all those years in St.

[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.560]
Petersburg and what a culture shock it was for them to leave St.

[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.440]
Petersburg and come to Fort Lodil with it,

[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.320]
which at that time was where spring break was happening.

[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:31.960]
And in St.

[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.580]
Petersburg, you know what was happening there,

[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.040]
Will, because you've been to spring train in that city.

[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.100]
There was nothing there, right?

[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.720]
Well, I was in poor Charlotte for five years.

[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.920]
When you were with the...

[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.920]
Did you ever go to St. Petersburg?

[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:44.840]
Nope.

[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.520]
For spring training, never did?

[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.460]
Nope, nope.

[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.220]
Nine years before that, I was in Arizona.

[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:52.120]
Yeah.

[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.960]
Right, with the Giants.

[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.040]
Yeah, pay you up.

[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.780]
How is it coming over to the American League?

[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.820]
You looking forward to it?

[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.700]
I've been in the American League for five years now.

[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:02.440]
Yeah.

[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.120]
So I'm not unfamiliar with it.

[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.140]
I'm looking forward to just starting with a new team here.

[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.200]
All right.

[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.360]
All right, stop it.

[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.240]
Gail Z.

[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.700]
Gail Z.

[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.960]
Talking on a board show.

[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.680]
Trying to be my show.

[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.780]
Your boy sounds just like a saddened year old girl.

[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.600]
A little sports-hole show.

[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.040]
What else are you sad for?

[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:33.980]
Gail Z.

[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:35.400]
Gail Z.

[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.520]
Talking like a baby.

[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.420]
Who needs a little training?

[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.520]
Like a new uncertainty.

[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.600]
You don't sound like a man.

[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.300]
Remove the rubber band.

[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.760]
That choke.

[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.980]
Your throat comes.

[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:53.740]
Gail Z.

[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.280]
Gail Z.

[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:56.680]
Gail Z.

[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:57.160]
Oh!

[00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.800]
Gail Z.

[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.020]
You're lucky, man.

[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.600]
It's just don't tell.

[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.440]
Gail Z.

[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.260]
You don't belong there on the air.

[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.160]
And Gail Z.

[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.780]
The sport can wait till your voice cracks.

[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:20.380]
Cause anyone who sounds like that should find another job.

[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:26.040]
And they should only take you back when both your babies drop.

[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:27.600]
Gail Z.

[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.100]
Gail Z.

[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.400]
When you're gone and grow up.

[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.280]
You make that wall to grow up.

[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.280]
You silly, squeaky, fool.

[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.140]
Go to broadcasting school.

[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.380]
Your fridge, you bastard.

[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.120]
It's always.

[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.380]
Thank you.

[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.840]
Now, time's up.

[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:47.760]
Yes.

[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.280]
You're up.

[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.020]
Hot.

[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.120]
You're up.

[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:52.880]
Hot.

[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.880]
That's 17 to 5.

[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:54.640]
50 to 15.

[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.640]
Thanks to our sisters.

[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.720]
We'll check down the NEC.

[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.300]
Me too, son.

[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:57.860]
Hot.

[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.080]
I think that's what I can do.

[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.280]
That's for you, sweetheart.

[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.300]
For my lovely lunch.

[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.660]
Is there a little sauce in here?

[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.300]
No, I don't know.

[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.460]
I got scared there for a second.

[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.860]
Well, by the way, Hank, I heard Hank yesterday

[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.800]
talking about the fact that he's the red that Bernstein

[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.200]
book on diabetes, which is great.

[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:14.540]
By the way, you're right about that, Humper.

[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.300]
And he was asking because I mentioned the other day

[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.340]
in the Shmere Olive Oil, which is one of the things I didn't

[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.820]
just make that up out of my mind, OK?

[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.440]
Although I do like extra virgin olive oil.

[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.040]
Great stuff.

[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.020]
But the Shmere down your feet, because your feet

[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.560]
are very important when you diabetic.

[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.920]
A circulation, you know, you have the slightest problem,

[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:31.600]
infection, whatever.

[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.060]
Keep those feet in good shape.

[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.960]
And Hank was concerned, because I said,

[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:35.800]
do it before you go to bed.

[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.540]
I don't mean like right before you go to bed, Hank.

[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.500]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.100]
Like maybe, you know, in the evening.

[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.060]
And the amazing part of it is you don't have to worry

[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.820]
about what it smells like when you go to bed,

[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.720]
at least not your feet.

[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.400]
Because amazingly, your skin absorbs the olive oil,

[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.200]
which is the whole idea.

[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.100]
And olive oil does smell like too much anyway, right?

[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.200]
I've never had either one of my dogs has ever complained.

[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.640]
Now, if I was going to be spending, you know,

[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.020]
a couple hours in the sack, about half an hour in the sack

[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.040]
with some hot number, then, you know, maybe I'd wait

[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:06.960]
until after she left.

[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.480]
And then I would, you know, then I'd apply the olive oil

[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:12.840]
on my feet.

[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.460]
So anyway, it's 10.19 as far as the WQM.

[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.560]
Let's just have a massive war on a whole station,

[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.880]
I guess, is what those guys want.

[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:22.320]
I don't know.

[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.280]
I'm having a good time.

[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.040]
Just like a member of Magic Johnson said that on that show,

[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:26.900]
I'm having a good time.

[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.040]
Two weeks later, it was canceled,

[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.800]
because the audience was having a miserable time.

[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.700]
I had some great folks there at the hockey game last time.

[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.440]
I've got a friend, Sean, his home for the outbreak

[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.700]
from Northwestern University in Chicago,

[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.480]
which he said is a living and breathing city

[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.160]
with real people.

[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.080]
Told you, Sean.

[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.740]
But of course, the game itself, I mean, what is there to say?

[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.240]
I hear these people analyzing Terry Murray as this,

[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.260]
Terry Murray, you know?

[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.980]
And I will give credit.

[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.120]
I think that Geldy was right there at the end,

[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.620]
even a little ass sucker like him, he's right.

[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.720]
And that is that this team offensively,

[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.960]
I mean, when you're two, thank you, Mary, I'm God bless you.

[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.580]
When you're two supposed top centers,

[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.480]
Victor Kuzlov and Nidomar, I mean, Nidomar,

[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.340]
and they keep quoting one of paper, he's lost.

[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:05.540]
I'm screaming at him, the whole game,

[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.480]
Robby, do something, get with it,

[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.240]
a little effort there.

[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.020]
Robby's hopeless.

[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.880]
And Victor Kuzlov, maybe he should be on a ABC,

[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.220]
a figure skating thing tonight,

[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.360]
because that's all he does.

[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.060]
He skates around these big looping circles.

[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.820]
I mean, round and around, and nothing ever happens.

[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.540]
And then Whitney feeds him a great pass there,

[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.200]
and a two on one.

[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.940]
I mean, wide open side of that, he shoots at 10 feet wide.

[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.060]
Victor, that ain't good to get the job done.

[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.400]
So we've had major, major disappointment to me.

[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.160]
It's good old Victor Kuzlov.

[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.220]
And you know, you take, I mean, what's really left?

[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.100]
You take Bury out of there,

[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.340]
and of course, then I'm reading that he didn't bother skating yesterday.

[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.520]
Again, maybe he'll skate today.

[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.360]
Is it likely he'll be back for that big game

[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.460]
to Varanite against Nashville?

[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:45.820]
No.

[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.480]
I mean, now that the team is like just about on a virgin being,

[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.460]
I mean, everything on that scoreboard last night

[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.820]
in the Macarena total disaster.

[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.480]
Oh my god, the Leafs getting pounded by San Jose.

[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.960]
Eight to five, it winds up.

[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.680]
And Boston waiting, three nothing over Ottawa,

[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.460]
and Carolina beating out the oners.

[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.720]
I mean, everything bad that could have happened on the scoreboard

[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.920]
happened last night, including in the arena itself.

[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.480]
And don't let the fact that we outshot the Rangers by that margin,

[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.700]
it means nothing, because I mean, Victor played okay.

[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.380]
He played pretty good,

[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.020]
but there weren't really many scoring chances.

[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.740]
They were mostly far out pussy shots.

[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.000]
And when we did have a good chance,

[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.560]
oh, oh, can't get the job done.

[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.280]
Right, Robbie?

[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:21.720]
Right.

[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.560]
The idea that they're quoting Needermar.

[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.220]
You know, when they lose these big games,

[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.100]
and Airbnb faceoff, especially they didn't lighten the game.

[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.460]
Airbnb, at least he's consistent.

[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.520]
Here's Peter Ned that against Robbie Needermar,

[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.040]
a big faceoff a minute to go in the game.

[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.880]
We pulled the goalie, fixed attackers out there.

[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.020]
Robbie, win a faceoff.

[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:39.580]
Can he win one?

[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:39.800]
No.

[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.080]
Lost him all, all the big ones.

[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.760]
Game after game after game.

[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.660]
So they keep you know with the, with the smoke and mirrors,

[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.740]
the organization this, and you're going to say,

[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.840]
you know, they keep blowing smoke, but it was very sad.

[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.200]
So I guess maybe we'll be getting good credits on that,

[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.600]
to play off money toward next year.

[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.080]
There you go.

[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:56.400]
Oh!

[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.760]
Definitely happy about WQAM.

[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:03.880]
WQAM.

[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.220]
How are you doing, Neil?

[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.260]
I know you were at the game,

[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.940]
so you couldn't have missed a gem that your buddy,

[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.180]
Rimmer, who said last night,

[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.900]
first off, he's talking about the game,

[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.900]
and where else gets an a little scuffle,

[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.240]
and he says, oh, I tell you, he said the one thing about the Panthers.

[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.720]
Hey Joe Castello is back today from his bot with Mono,

[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:22.000]
thanks to a Greg Reed, go ahead.

[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:22.900]
They, will stop.

[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:23.500]
Yeah.

[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.240]
He says, oh, the one thing about the Panthers,

[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.280]
we have one of the best one, two punches in hockey.

[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.200]
I almost rolled off the sofa.

[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.100]
Who, who is him?

[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.180]
You asked, or, who was he talking about?

[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.220]
Who was he talking about?

[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.520]
He was talking about,

[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.020]
where else got a little scuffle,

[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.660]
and he says, oh, well, with Lawrence,

[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.600]
and where else, they're like,

[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.860]
what a waste of time that will realize,

[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.500]
I mean, you know, gets a stupid penalty,

[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.940]
and then of course, remember, they scored one of the goals on a four on a four.

[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:47.220]

[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.480]
And I, huh?

[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.020]
And I scored, Brett had again screening Porsche on Burke,

[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.540]
they're skating right in front of him on the first goal there,

[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.900]
the Graves goal, that was pathetic.

[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.980]
Listen, Rimmer, a one-two punch is a pass from the other,

[00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.340]
just stalk it at a goal.

[00:17:59.600 --> 00:17:59.700]
Did you?

[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.280]
One-fifth, two-foot-a-go, you're an asshole, Rimmer, you're out of the goal.

[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.500]
I'll tell him that at dinner Saturday,

[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.160]
thank you, sir.

[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.860]
By the way, Rimmer, this guy says you're an asshole.

[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.880]
Now, he's not an asshole, he's just a shield.

[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.860]
We know, oh, there's Andrew Koonan in the hallway.

[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.580]
You know, I got a title there, Sam, seriously,

[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.140]
because everybody in the building,

[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.520]
we've been showing that picture in that book.

[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.100]
You know, the Koonan in on the deathbed,

[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.540]
because it looks so much like you,

[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.300]
and I held it up to Geltie this March,

[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.180]
and I said, there's Andrew Koonan,

[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.660]
you think he looks like Sam and Geltie said,

[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.800]
hey, that's a good looking guy.

[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.080]
And I thought, what kind of a comment is that?

[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.700]
For a guy that's supposedly getting married.

[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.620]
Koonan would all have blood on his foot?

[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:35.920]
Hey, that's a good looking guy.

[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.160]
Jesus, Geltie.

[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.380]
Maybe that one testicle is about to descend,

[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.020]
instead of the, maybe we'll call him Rigling,

[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:42.840]
instead of Geltie, huh?

[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.200]
If he's moving up into the world,

[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.640]
instead of Gelting, it's originally.

[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:45.980]
Oh!

[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.560]
And you horse people know what that is.

[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.960]
Yeah, that's a horse with one descendant testicle.

[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.380]
That doesn't talk quite so high.

[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.120]
See, Sam does know that picture looks just like him.

[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.660]
You've been freaked out ever since, haven't you?

[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.060]
He's been walking to my like, uh-uh.

[00:18:59.480 --> 00:18:59.840]
Uh-uh.

[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.160]
Not going over to the beach any time soon.

[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:02.640]
Uh-uh.

[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.040]
Not going by that Versace mentioned any time soon.

[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.420]
And well, if it'll make you feel that

[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:10.780]
or I'll read you the last line in the book.

[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.980]
Of course, keep in mind the scary Indiana is

[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.260]
an out-of-the-closet screaming fag who writes the whole book

[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:16.980]
from that perspective.

[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.100]
But he says, the last sentence, he says,

[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.860]
the bullet bounced around in his skull

[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.580]
and came to rest without damaging his face,

[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.660]
contrary to all reports.

[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.080]
In fact, Andrew looked really, really pretty.

[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.620]
Now, I find that rather repugnant comment.

[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.520]
I didn't think he looked pretty even before the bullet, you know.

[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:32.780]
But nevertheless, he said,

[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.540]
hey, that's a good looking guy.

[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.480]
But anyway, 24 past 10 at 560 WQM.

[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.540]
Don't be ripping a morning show.

[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.920]
Okay, I mean, he got the real problems unless you want to, of course.

[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.560]
I mean, here's the schmuck calling in this morning a suckling.

[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:46.880]
Oh, needles are schmuck.

[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.160]
Neal, but we're ripping a chill.

[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.680]
You know, what am I supposed to say?

[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.580]
Okay, I mean, I can't, I'm not the one who makes the decisions.

[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.900]
I'm the one that, not the one decided to put Henry Biro

[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.780]
and Chuck Meyer on there.

[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:55.880]
Next Monday.

[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.660]
They're just not cutting it.

[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.660]
They're costing us all money.

[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:01.500]
WQAM.

[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:02.880]
Anya, how are you?

[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:03.260]
Great.

[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.840]
Great game, let's make, huh?

[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.320]
Sounds like a chronic regular to me.

[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.120]
What's the game?

[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:07.640]
Yeah, it is.

[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.200]
He always says what's the difference?

[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.480]
That's that Jack asked Andy.

[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.460]
Only this time I'm on to a man because I got my blood sugar down.

[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.180]
I have a nice lunch from Chuck and E.C.

[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.380]
at the sub center on the quarter of 441 I have to do it.

[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.320]
The difference is we don't want to talk to you.

[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.480]
The audience doesn't want to hear you.

[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:21.820]
George hates you like poison.

[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.340]
I hate you like anything you can imagine.

[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.480]
That's the difference.

[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.760]
It's that it's my show.

[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:27.940]
And I don't want to talk to you.

[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.180]
I don't want your faxes.

[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.140]
I don't want to see you.

[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.040]
I don't want to know from you.

[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:31.500]

[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:32.700]
I'm like that.

[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:34.400]
When you said Andy, don't be angry at me.

[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:34.400]

[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:34.400]

[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:34.400]

[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:34.400]

[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:34.400]

[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:34.400]

[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.480]
Because we took a poll, and the audience said you know that, Andy,

[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:36.920]
from Hollywood?

[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:37.740]
He's an asshole.

[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:38.380]
That's right.

[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.880]
A nice glowing, well we every few people get a unanimous vote.

[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:44.380]
Huh?

[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.640]
I bet you people take a poll right now, but some people use

[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.940]
that they don't like they are.

[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.900]
I mean, when you hear that scratchy Screeching I'm

[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.120]
the first couple of words here.

[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.380]
All right, this is my theory.

[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.940]
Just look at it, laugh andっと.

[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:03.540]
I mean, it's sound, you know, you heard that old expression about your nuts and a vice.

[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.100]
Huh? Is that like, teats and a ring or nuts and a vice? Something like, I mean, listen.

[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:14.840]
See, this is, and this is my, come on. One octave lower practice with me.

[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.220]
And I even said something nice, remember, when Christina Moore missed a plane,

[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.940]
and I heard little excerpts of him doing a hockey game that I, good job there, Gildi.

[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:26.180]
Excellent, especially under those conditions. See, I tell it like it is.

[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:31.360]
I don't have any ass to grind though, agenda. Other, of course, than my homosexual agenda.

[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:37.260]
I mean, that goes without saying. Oh, big stories about the ballgame come up in Cuba this weekend. Oh boy.

[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.060]
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.200]
Got to be a lot of people doing a green apple quick step in a little havana this weekend.

[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.020]
Hey, that's a good looking guy.

[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:54.880]
There was a no farmer who lives on a ride. He's adding the metal just shaking his hip

[00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:02.020]
that some boys who were down by the fritz. There being the water, their hands on their marbles

[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:09.720]
and play things and at that pass-four. There came a young lady. She looked like a pretty young creature.

[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:16.540]
She sat on the grass. She pulled up her dress and she showed them her ruffles and laces

[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:23.360]
and white fluffy dung. She said she was learning a new way to bring up her children,

[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:28.740]
so they would not fit. While the boys in the barnyard were shoveling,

[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:35.480]
wrapped you send litter from yesterday's hunt. While the girl in the meadow was rubbing her

[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:43.860]
hide at the fellow down by the dot. He looked like a man with a side of a home in the country

[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:49.140]
with a big fence out front. If he asked her for a lightly, she showed him her

[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:56.800]
nesto pesto who was subject to fit. And maybe she let him grab hold of her small dinner

[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:03.280]
and with a movement so quick. And then she bent over and sucked on his candy

[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:10.060]
so tasty made a butter sky. And then he spread with cream all over her cookie

[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:16.740]
that she had left out on her shelf. If you think this is dirty, you can go f*** yourself.

[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:24.340]
Alright, well I get about an 82 on a scale of one. 1032 at 560 WQA.

[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.980]
So our poll question today is a guilty. Can't him or we'll keep him answer our poll question.

[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.520]
Actually yesterday I had a discussion of all the various jobs that are various

[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:40.240]
occupations that are mostly jobs held by homos. I'll come and left out school teachers.

[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:45.260]
I was thinking about this even before the show yesterday. I don't know what made me think about this.

[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.640]
But when I was in school, now I don't know if it's the same today as it used to be years ago.

[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.600]
Most of my teachers were miss the female teacher. Well some of the guys,

[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.100]
the female teachers were miss this and miss that. And I'm not talking.

[00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:01.360]
See in those days we used to call an old maid. Nobody back then whatever referred to somebody as a

[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.660]
bulldike. I mean that was impolite, you know, as an old dike.

[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:10.320]
So we used to call them old maids. And I could mention the names of some of the teachers

[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.400]
because I'm sure they're dead by now like Miss Maloy. She was my teacher in kindergarten first grade.

[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.060]
She's got to be dead by now. I hope. Well I mean not that I hope but I don't want to be, you know.

[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:23.100]
Well no I mean I'm not saying that Miss Maloy was a dike but she just seemed awfully old.

[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:28.080]
Not to have been married. And you know what they say about old people that haven't been married.

[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:34.840]
Hey stupid. But anyway, yeah most of my female teachers were miss this and miss that.

[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.840]
They were like in their 50s and 60s and I had like a Miss lion.

[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.100]
So definitely is dead by now. She was in her 70s.

[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.780]
Amazing as that may seem. Well I guess early 70s late 60s still teaching miss.

[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.020]
So there's another one you teachers. You know if you take this business about keeping

[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:55.380]
facts out of the teaching profession if they did that they have to shut down all the schools.

[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.340]
Especially the parochial school. People fact in the church.

[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:05.940]
But I'm wondering if that's still the same today. Most of your teachers like in the last you know 10-15 years have been missed this and missed that or missed the point.

[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:15.720]
5-6705-60, 0.560 on the mobile one line screenless Thursday by the way. And we're doing that because you know it's just kind of a we're just here for the formality today to set up the ballgame.

[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.880]
Cardinals and the Marlins four o'clock, four o'clock ankle beyond after the game.

[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.400]
12-50 we got the ballgame.

[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.780]
And then after the ballgame we got Hank and Chulis. The bookster will be on the right 6-10 and Captain Tenek.

[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:33.360]
Talking about boogers got thin skin. How can you be that fat and have thin skin? I don't understand that.

[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.720]
We're not saying it because we don't like your boog. The fact is you're turning it to a gigantic enormous cow.

[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.360]
Like that lady that called yesterday from Phoenix. The cow lady.

[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:44.620]
WQAM.

[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:49.820]
Yes sir. I heard through the grapevine you were doing screenless so I had to come out from under my rock.

[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:50.980]
Yeah. How you doing?

[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:53.700]
WQAM.

[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.180]
Hey I'm coming on how you doing?

[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:55.540]
Okay.

[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.820]
I was curious if you happen to have seen the Oscars in 10-11.

[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.700]
I did not. Well who can watch the Oscars? Why would I watch that crap?

[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.540]
Well it's just funny because Foupe said the shot word live at the Oscars.

[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.760]
And I was surprised that no one picked up on it.

[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.380]
Well maybe nobody cared.

[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:18.260]
You just you know how about backwards said a live on TV said bull shot after you won a Kentucky Derby last year.

[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:22.920]
I was just surprised during client time that the thumbers etc didn't just go berserk.

[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.920]
Well I'm delighted to hear we're making the progress. There you go there's some good news for you.

[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.320]
Oh and by the way everybody that's always threatening they're going to call the FCC.

[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.760]
By the way be my guest go ahead.

[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.600]
But there's a great article in Business Week magazine this week.

[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:40.000]
You realize thanks to our good friends and Republicans the FCC is basically being disemboweled

[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:45.440]
and being put right back to what it originally was supposed to be a bunch of paper pushers.

[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.420]
That's right there no longer going to be the censorship FCC.

[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.760]
They're going to be just the not and not even so much the technical FCC.

[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.320]
Now the only bad part of this is one of the things that the radio and TV people are screaming about,

[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:03.660]
especially the radio people, they're not happy with the restrictions and the number of stations they can own in a market.

[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.000]
How do you like that?

[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.240]
So in other words maybe queer channel can buy up every station in the market.

[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.180]
Maybe that's what they want.

[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:15.360]
And by the way for those people on the morning show I don't want to mention no names in particular.

[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.980]
But anybody on the morning show that's got a problem with this show with neo-roger?

[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.240]
Hey that's a good looking guy.

[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.360]
I'll tell you right now the only reason that you guys are still in there doing the sports stuff

[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.540]
and we're still all spots radio here is because of this show.

[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:34.080]
Because the last year the last 14 months that we've been here you take the numbers from midday out of here

[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.520]
and put back the fat sports pitch and Christina Moron with those horrible numbers they had before.

[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.240]
And I hate to break the news to you.

[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.940]
But the guy with the bad haircut down the hall he'd probably be out there shoveling whatever was on that song before.

[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:51.400]
And the stalls out at the golfstream or high alia.

[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:52.680]
That's right.

[00:27:53.800 --> 00:28:00.460]
Because the vultures were just hovering over this place before we came over here and rescue these dime badger.

[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.560]
That's why you got all those spots there in the morning.

[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.520]
Don't you understand that guy?

[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:05.920]
Because we got to pay baldy.

[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:12.060]
We've been held hostage thanks to Greg who's the great deal maker the wheeler the dealer the sports maven with monol.

[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.700]
We're held hostage to a baldy.

[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.460]
So the first you know 10 million dollars in revenue that we make that's all well and good.

[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:20.900]
That all goes into baldy's pocket.

[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.700]
Right baldy?

[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:24.900]
WQAM.

[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:27.860]
QAM.

[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.540]
Nice talking to you WQAM.

[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:31.640]
Neil.

[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.140]
Yes sir.

[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:32.960]
How's it going buddy?

[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:33.340]
Great.

[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.280]
Brandon D when you were leaving the game last night I said hi to you.

[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:36.780]
Yeah.

[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:37.620]
Anyway.

[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.120]
I like that they got out of there pretty quick last night.

[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:40.860]
Yeah the morgue.

[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.540]
I left the morgue a little before game ended.

[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.320]
Pretty depressing.

[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:44.600]
Very depressing.

[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.580]
I like to scream with the hour because I don't have to pay for this call until you pick it up.

[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.040]
Yeah.

[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.500]
I mean you're a genius arrestiner.

[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:51.060]
He's eating lunch.

[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:51.280]
That's right.

[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.400]
He's already done blinding.

[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:57.680]
Did you see the article in Sports Illustrator about the guy we drafted Andrew Long?

[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.180]
No.

[00:28:59.240 --> 00:28:59.600]
Terrible.

[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:05.620]
This guy was trying to justify in a way the bolder the Jesse Bolder's guy hitting him.

[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:09.000]
Saying this game has played on the edge and he just went over the edge just a little bit.

[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:09.440]
Yeah right.

[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.300]
As you ever get to get to.

[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.200]
I say fried ass.

[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:12.880]
I agree.

[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:13.560]
He's unbelievable.

[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.580]
He started to get back in the game this kid.

[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.560]
By the way what was that that Needamar was doing there?

[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:23.120]
You know, spiraling a guy between the legs there on that face off on was and lucky that didn't get a penalty they're late in the game.

[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:23.680]
What the hell was that?

[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.120]
You see that?

[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.580]
That's all the time Needamar goes after somebody.

[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.820]
He's got, you know, the game.

[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:28.980]
When he went between their legs.

[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:33.720]
I thought that maybe Nikki's too busy doing that MTV spring break thing and she ain't taking care of him anymore.

[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:34.620]
He said a lot.

[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.780]
We don't even talk to him about Needamar.

[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.000]
Man he's the worst.

[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:38.760]
Absolutely.

[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:45.400]
And they keep quoting when the news paper they keep having these articles and he said, oh well gee that was a game we really needed.

[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.380]
We just didn't say yeah.

[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.600]
Yeah right Robbie you're a good sposh spokesman huh?

[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.860]
He shows up for every one of the dozen games and it just he's that.

[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:53.360]
That's pretty easy.

[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:53.800]
It's a bad game.

[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.240]
Air media face off.

[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.520]
Air media important face off loses it.

[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.480]
Air every single one.

[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.040]
I told my brother I brought him the first game and went to that guy.

[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.080]
I said okay we got Chris Wells and Robbie.

[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.840]
Yeah Chris Wells had him out there.

[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.920]
I'm gonna kill both.

[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:11.820]
He's sick while they were scoring while Ned med scored the second goal because Chris he was walking around with the remnants of a broken stick there.

[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.940]
I mean that can happen anybody understand.

[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.080]
But it's just that poor Chris he just can't do anything right.

[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:21.200]
When he broke it and dropped it took him turn to a brother off and listen this guy play with a stick.

[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.540]
Like we're in trouble right now and yeah.

[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:22.760]
Yeah.

[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.340]
About a thing exactly about a thing that's right.

[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.000]
Well at least that we have no more pressure anyway.

[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.120]
Pressures that's right why bring Barry back there.

[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.080]
Yeah he'll be you know when he's good and ready he'll come back.

[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:32.840]
Have a great day sir.

[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.280]
Very well you got bless you okay right.

[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.700]
Very Whitney feeds cause of a perfect passes the two on one.

[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.140]
You can smell a goal is coming.

[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.000]
Victor with a shot.

[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:40.900]
It's 10 feet wide.

[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:46.580]
But the organization we got the youngsters in the organization and they are right.

[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.100]
Too much BS from VM that's what I say.

[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.700]

Well it's pretty close where I get in close to it.

Never made it no harm.

[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:52.480]
They thought you never saw because they're each other's call and they're working their balls.

[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.920]
Russian there comes.

[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.000]

[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:06.420]

[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.020]
They're getting laid.

[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.200]
They're going to hell.

[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:19.180]
That's just a little more fun than going to heaven from cows.

[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:22.500]

[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.100]

[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.560]
Yeah that'll be on ESPN but the electric knot okay.

[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:55.300]
Too bad.

[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:56.780]
Grow up.

Get with the program.

[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.100]

[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.760]
You know speaking of that Bud Light spot.

[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.720]
I must have seen that 15 times last night after the hockey game.

[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.340]
The greatest TV spot in history paper or plastic.

[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.020]
Did you see you've seen that the best.

[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.140]
Hey guys need a receipt?

[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:26.840]

Makes you want to go right in and take a good and be thankful.

[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.860]
You got all that toilet paper.

[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:38.580]
WQAM.

[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:38.840]
Hello.

[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.540]
Yeah we just talked to the wager we had disconnected.

[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.000]
Great.

[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.100]
Turn that radio off sir.

[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.040]
Oh no how are you?

[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:53.340]
Great.

[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.440]
I wasn't expecting you to answer.

[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:54.860]
You ought to see.

[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.540]
This is the idea.

[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:56.760]
Get these people to lock out.

[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.420]
They're like that Jackass Andy and Hollywood.

[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.220]
That's called 17 times already.

[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:01.320]
Right.

[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.560]

[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.460]
Connection here.

[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.780]
What do I think are the chances of what sir?

[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.340]
Forget about it.

[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:18.600]
No.

[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.060]
Oh.

[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:21.700]

[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.260]
See what I'm saying?

[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.300]
Don't look at me.

[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.820]
I'm doing great.

[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.240]
There's something in the air baby.

[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.320]
Even ThunderClaft Newman.

[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.100]
Even Alfred Emanueelman is chocolate about it.

[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:33.660]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:35.900]
WQAM.

[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:38.960]
Neil, get off the air you check on.

[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.300]
WQAM.

[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:42.440]
QAM.

[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:42.700]
Hello.

[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.420]
Good morning Neil.

[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:44.960]
Yes ma'am.

[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.020]
I just turned...

[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:47.620]
I love your show.

[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.080]
I turned in...

[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.020]
You turned in other show?

[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:50.920]
Harden.

[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:51.940]
I love you.

[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:52.560]
Can you...

[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:52.840]
Wait a minute.

[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.460]
Can you hear me?

[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:53.920]
Yes.

[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:57.180]
Because the other guy just acted like he couldn't hear me.

[00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.440]
What seems to be the problem here?

[00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.480]
Oh, I can hear you great.

[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.180]
Then how come when I asked you a question you didn't respond?

[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:03.520]
You were listening to another show?

[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.080]
No, I have my radio off.

[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.860]
I said I listened to the end of...

[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.880]
I tuned in a little bit late and I heard the end of it.

[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.640]
And you mentioned that Henry Barrel and Chuck Meyer...

[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.860]
Are they coming to your station?

[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:16.300]
Yes.

[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:16.780]

[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.340]
Oh, what time?

[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.320]
6 to 10 am starting Monday.

[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.580]
Oh great.

[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.380]
I love Henry Barrel.

[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.380]
Yeah, what about Chuck Meyer?

[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:25.400]
Well, I...

[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.800]
Chuck is going to be in the anchor.

[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:27.100]
He's not...

[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.640]
He's not sold on a holiday through doing the news.

[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.840]
I'm working on P.W. Herman, forget him.

[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.140]
Yeah.

[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.380]
I remember him from...

[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.100]
Well, I really can't quite place him.

[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:36.820]
Who's that Henry Barrel?

[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:37.100]
Oh!

[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.520]
No, no, I know Henry.

[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:40.220]
I love...

[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:40.420]
Well, he's Chuck Meyer.

[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:41.360]
Yeah, right.

[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:44.700]
Well, I love Henry Barrel and I know he went off the other station

[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.060]
and I thought, what a loss.

[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.260]
Well, where did you hear about that?

[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.740]
Who told you he went off that other station?

[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.680]
Well, um...

[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:51.040]
Okay.

[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.860]
He went off on a Friday, which I listened to the...

[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:55.800]
Didn't hear the whole thing.

[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.380]
I didn't hear him say he was leaving.

[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:01.500]
But my husband listens to the Garden Show on Saturday.

[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:02.460]
Oh, he's the one, yeah.

[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.980]
And he mentioned it.

[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.100]
He said he retired from radio.

[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.320]
And I thought, oh, God.

[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:10.400]
So I took...

[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.560]
I'm petty wanting the day he left IODs the day that he retired from radio.

[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.960]
He didn't realize it, but that was...

[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.160]
Right.

[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.520]
So then I called Mundi his day...

[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.700]
Too much flash he built up Henry.

[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.040]
I called...

[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.920]
I called his station Monday and they didn't know he won't be here.

[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:23.860]
Well, the good news is for you.

[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:24.780]
Let's call him Monday.

[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.780]
What's today's this Monday?

[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.180]
Whatever it is, the...

[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.120]
29th.

[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:28.320]
29th.

[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:29.100]
Great.

[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:29.980]
6 to 10 a.m.

[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.400]
Chuck Meyer, Henry Barrel, Ron Harrison, Roger Magglin.

[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.460]
The entertainment report.

[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:33.840]
Paul and Harrison?

[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:34.400]
Right.

[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.080]
I loved him.

[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:36.640]
There you go.

[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.020]
Well, now you got something to look forward to, sweetheart.

[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.340]
Right, 6 to 10.

[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:41.940]
Yeah, I can't get.

[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.160]
I know Mike Rineri's up to the ground.

[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:44.920]
No, I can't get him.

[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:45.760]
He's up there at...

[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:45.980]
I know.

[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:46.560]
I need him a big time.

[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.620]
I'm a JNA station.

[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:48.680]
But I get it.

[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.440]
Della Reese records.

[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.280]
One from the law.

[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.540]
Well, you can't listen to both shows at the same time, sweetheart.

[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:52.820]
Oh.

[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.320]
Now you got the good news.

[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.300]
I'm giving you a good news.

[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.780]
Ron Harrison, I'll...

[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:57.920]
Rex Harrison, right?

[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:58.240]
What?

[00:36:58.700 --> 00:36:58.720]
T.

[00:36:58.960 --> 00:36:59.660]
George Harrison?

[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:01.680]
Love you, Neil.

[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.160]
Okay, Mike.

[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.280]
Good Lord, have a great day.

[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:03.900]
Okay, geez.

[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.360]
I'm trying to give that lady some good news.

[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.880]
It's like she's in disbelief for crying out loud.

[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.460]
We all know Ron Harrison.

[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.640]
Hey, that's a good-looking guy.

[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:11.640]
Christ.

[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:13.840]
WQIM.

[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.120]
Hello.

[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:14.860]
It's Christ.

[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:16.800]
WQIM.

[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:17.860]
There's one right there.

[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:18.460]
There's one right there.

[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:19.320]
WQIM.

[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:19.560]
Hello.

[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:20.280]
Hello.

[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:21.400]
Speaking.

[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:21.820]
Yes.

[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:22.860]
Yes.

[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.520]
Oh, I wanted to say a new phone, sir.

[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:26.280]
Get a phone that works.

[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.300]
I can't do that to the audience.

[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.020]
I'd rather talk to Bozos than some guy with a bad phone.

[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:34.080]
I'd rather talk about Chuck Meyer and Henry Beard.

[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:34.300]
Oh!

[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:34.960]
Okay.

[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.840]
Then somebody with a phone like that.

[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.860]
Get a real phone.

[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:39.580]
Take the 10 cans of the string.

[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.700]
Toss him out the window.

[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:41.780]
Just toss him.

[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:43.840]
Come on.

[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.000]
I want to hear about your teachers about the bull-bike teachers.

[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:46.920]
Not by name, of course.

[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:48.360]
I want to hear all the old teachers.

[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.040]
Now, how about you?

[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.660]
Were your teachers miss the old ladies?

[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:52.440]
Most of them, yes.

[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:53.360]
Yeah, old maid.

[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.300]
Isn't that what we all heard?

[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:55.280]
Old schoolmarms.

[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.260]
Old schoolmarms.

[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.720]
Yeah, they were old dikes is what they were.

[00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.080]
We never realized that.

[00:37:59.180 --> 00:37:59.640]
So there's another.

[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.680]
That should have been to top of the list right next to the priest in the nuns.

[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.120]
Who are also teachers, by the way.

[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.220]
I don't mind telling you what they teach, but I think you have a good idea.

[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:09.760]
WQIM.

[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:10.400]
Hello.

[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:11.260]
Hello.

[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:12.740]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:13.600]
Hey, everybody.

[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.000]
Okay.

[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:16.740]
I'll get a better phone.

[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:18.360]
WQIM.

[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:18.660]
Hello.

[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:19.960]
Is this the lightning round?

[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:20.760]
Right back to bird.

[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.320]
No, yeah.

[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:22.440]
We're going to give you the bird.

[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.340]
There you go, pal.

[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.120]
Hop on it.

[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.080]
WQIM.

[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:25.380]
Hello.

[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:27.220]
QIM.

[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:29.340]
WQIM.

[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:30.540]
Neil.

[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.240]
See, we have to go through 100 to get a good one, but at least we get some.

[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:33.620]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.040]
Good afternoon, sir.

[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:35.400]
How are you?

[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:35.720]
Great.

[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.300]
Three things.

[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:37.840]
Number one.

[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.000]
I'm going to fill out a great lunch.

[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.260]
Get ready to get out of here at 1250 for a big ball game.

[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:41.960]
Great.

[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:47.140]
Still laugh at the lady that you just told her that, and Barrel's just coming back on QAM.

[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:48.500]
Well, you don't believe that?

[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.040]
I believe anything you tell me, sir.

[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.060]
Henry Barrel, you remember Chuck Meyer?

[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:54.800]
Before my time.

[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:55.700]
For my OD?

[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.440]
Before my time, sir.

[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.020]
Unfortunately.

[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.360]
Oh, my God.

[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.960]
I have just tasted your snack.

[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:01.820]
Get out of here, Henry.

[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.600]
It's not time yet.

[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.000]
Before my time.

[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.280]
Joe Kostello's going to be doing the fishing report, son.

[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.200]
That's Joe too, by the way.

[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.280]
He just stuck his head in the door to tell us.

[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:14.120]
He's going to be doing the auto racing show Saturday morning, 6 to 7, and the fishing reports

[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.660]
on a morning show with Henry and Chuck.

[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.580]
I forgot more about auto races than Joe Kostello ever know.

[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.520]
Now, he just said that the bird is coming back, and he just gave it to you is what he did.

[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:28.260]
Don't forget, Joe Kostello, 6 to 7 this Saturday morning, going around and around and around.

[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.260]
Oh, God, I forgot about that Jack Gordon song, by the way.

[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:32.540]
That would have been good.

[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.200]
We'll get it on today.

[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.220]
What if it had been good yesterday?

[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.440]
Joe wants to know if he can play that on his show.

[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.260]
Play what?

[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:39.320]
The Jeff Gordon song?

[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:39.940]
Sure.

[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.620]
You can play whatever you want.

[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:42.880]
You're part of your family here.

[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.360]
That's why the rest of the guys hate your luck, boys.

[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.980]
By the way, he's going back home because Greg gave him mono.

[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.500]
No, sir, why are you still sick?

[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:51.680]
How do you like that?

[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:52.780]
What did I tell you?

[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.580]
And the problem with Greg Reed is you tell him anything, and he looks at you like,

[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.060]
like, everything's a joke.

[00:39:58.680 --> 00:39:59.940]
He doesn't take anything seriously.

[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.120]
Maybe he just doesn't have the intellect to take anything seriously.

[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.600]
It doesn't think in that spot he keeps searching for in the top of his head,

[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.560]
but he keeps scratching where the brain used to be.

[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.000]
He keeps scratching and searching.

[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.620]
And you know, the old saying where there's no sense, there's no feeling?

[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.640]
Don't take it personally, Greg.

[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.220]
It's not that we don't like you.

[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:20.880]
It's just we don't want you spreading disease around here.

[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.600]
And I'm not making that up either.

[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:26.060]
I told a few people that the boss has got, because they say, is he really got mono?

[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:27.020]
And I said, yeah.

[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:30.460]
And he's coming in there, expressing all the most highly infectious diseases,

[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.100]
and I'm like, how am I spitting out my meatballs all over just talking about it?

[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:35.940]
I'm spitting it, and the meatballs too.

[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:37.640]
Go home, Greg.

[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.280]
Get some rest.

[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.020]
We can get along here without you're for a few hours, you know.

[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.960]
We can somehow scrape our way by.

[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.020]
In fact, go out there and have a meeting with Wayne.

[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:46.740]
Give him the mono.

[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.540]
He deserves it.

[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.880]
Not a good guy like Joe Castello.

[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.340]
We think he's a good guy.

[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:51.940]
Of course, the other guy.

[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:55.280]
And you know, the interesting part about it, some of the egos on this radio station.

[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.960]
Some people get really uptight and upset about silly things.

[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:58.200]

[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.540]
And you know, like the day I came out of here and I said, Lawrence Taylor was a running back.

[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:02.800]
Okay, I make as many mistakes.

[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:03.540]
What do I know?

[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.080]
I don't watch the stupid giants play.

[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.880]
To me, he's just another gangster.

[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.140]
I don't know what another drug addict.

[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.200]
So, you know, we all make mistakes.

[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.200]
But these people that get all uptight about these silly things for crying out loud.

[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.200]
What's wrong with you guys?

[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.220]
What is wrong?

[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.320]
What is the matter with you?

[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.540]
When are you going to grow up and get a life?

[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.660]
And get with the important stuff.

[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.520]
If we ever figure out what that is.

[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:26.180]
WQAM.

[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:26.440]
Hello.

[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:28.420]
QAM.

[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:30.720]
WQAM.

[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:31.940]
Hey, Neil.

[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:32.340]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.060]
You think you can't go up against G.

[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.040]
You think he'd been...

[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:35.440]
No, I don't.

[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:36.140]
WQAM.

[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:36.360]
Hello.

[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:37.900]
Yeah, Neil?

[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:38.420]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.500]
Now, we used to have a physics teacher.

[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.480]
You remember when they used to like paddle back in school?

[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.240]
Yes.

[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.720]
Well, they used to teach the fine whenever we were paddling their rectum.

[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.220]
Now, whenever we were bad, we'd have to get paddled.

[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.780]
But we'd have to get paddled very fast.

[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:55.100]
And about five years after I left high school, it was in the paper.

[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.240]
So, you got, you got a cam for doing something.

[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.520]
I think it was inappropriate with the student or something.

[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:01.200]
How do you like that?

[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:02.840]
Yeah, but yeah.

[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.320]
Like I said, do you hear that?

[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.040]
Do you hear that exchange?

[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.520]
I said something like S&M Hyde.

[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.560]
I mean, he used to need the name of a school, sir.

[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:12.240]
It was just an observation.

[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:14.340]
Oh, there's Jack Kavorkian, by the way.

[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.440]
Levering his closing arguments, they're all saying, hey, Jolte,

[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.500]
you're going to the electric chair or something like that.

[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.260]
He don't carry the old guy.

[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.240]
He's helped a lot of people off themselves.

[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.180]
I say, let's hear it for Dr. Jolte.

[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:28.580]
Kind of a country is where you can't blow your own brains out.

[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:31.060]
Where you can't use end to misery and the suffering.

[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:32.260]
Huh?

[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:34.960]
That's what we're doing with the morning show.

[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.460]
We're ending the misery and the suffering.

[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.700]
I wonder, Deepo is running around the hall with the baseball bat.

[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.520]
He's just waiting for Henry Barrett to show up again.

[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.260]
Monday morning, sweetheart.

[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:47.840]
I wonder if they're going to let the guy say goodbye out tomorrow morning.

[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.180]
Oh, I got a call.

[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:53.140]
Where's the line?

[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:54.340]
Where's the line?

[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.300]
I got up this morning.

[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.760]
It was 3 a.m.

[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.760]
I was sleepy as to be.

[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:06.280]
I was searching for that bathroom light, because I really got a pee.

[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.760]
Call it being lazy.

[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.500]
I got to go so bad I can't think.

[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:17.340]
Man would I be introuble if she caught me pee-ing and the thing?

[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:22.920]
Guys do it all the time a late night when we take a leak.

[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:23.620]
Squirt, Squirt?

[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:28.880]
It's just too much darn trouble to put down the toilet seat.

[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.440]
Oh, I've sit down but it's the water.

[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.040]
Man can I hear her whine?

[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.820]
Use all the toilet paper underwear on the floor.

[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.640]
Guys do it, yeah?

[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.360]
All the time.

[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:45.320]
Vero!

[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.480]
I'm sorry honey.

[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:49.280]
Take out your underwear.

[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.380]
You forgot to put down the toilet seat.

[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:53.860]
I'm sorry there.

[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.520]
I'll do it next time I promise.

[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.260]
I'm seeing too long over the pipe.

[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.140]
Water over the floor.

[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:02.680]
I love you there.

[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.540]
Take your mother's ear.

[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.840]
Take your mother's ear.

[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.060]
11-1-560 WQM.

[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:13.940]
By the way speaking of chocolate salty balls you'll be very pleased to know, at least George Will,

[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:19.060]
Academy Award winning singer, a songwriter, Isaac Kays, now the voice of Chef on the cartoon South Park,

[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:24.100]
and singer, songwriter Randy Newman, are among the latest entertainers lined up to take the stage at Sunfest.

[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:30.720]
Also announced on Wednesday were Kenny G, the B-52s, and Kobanismo.

[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.180]
Kobanismo, I think they left an eye on isn't it Kobanismo?

[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.200]
Is that Kobanismo?

[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.540]
That's some stupid radius, whatever.

[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:43.620]
The performers tap off a long list of our T-scheduled to entertain at Sunfest, the five-day music festival on Flagler Drive,

[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.660]
along the intercostal waterway in West Palm Beach, April 28th, May 2nd.

[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:48.740]
You'll be there, right?

[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:49.560]
See Isaac Kays?

[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:51.480]
He's a Scientologist.

[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.060]
Oh you won't be there for that.

[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:53.380]
He is?

[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.480]
Well I heard you say that.

[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:55.220]
That's a two, yeah.

[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:55.980]
Oh very impressive.

[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:56.760]
Goes to show you.

[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.600]
Yeah but why should you be concerned about that?

[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:02.800]
If you like the Tom Cruise movie, would you not like the movie because he's a Scientologist?

[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:03.740]
No I don't care.

[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:04.980]
You were big on Pulp Fiction.

[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:06.040]
I was?

[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:06.400]
No.

[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.580]
I like two scenes from that movie.

[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:10.600]
Yeah.

[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.160]
And then what about the May and A's on the Fry's in Amsterdam?

[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.100]
Do you know that they...

[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:18.760]
I mean come on.

[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:20.320]
Jesus.

[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.980]
Yeah, you know that's why a lot of people in this town like that movie because they've never been anywhere.

[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:25.180]
Except maybe Cuba.

[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.680]
WQAM, hello.

[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:28.920]
Hello Doc.

[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:29.480]
Yes.

[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:30.900]
How are you doing today Neil?

[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.100]
Great, never been better sir.

[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.140]
I finished a great lunch.

[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.160]
I'm getting out of here early.

[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.620]
Come on you know what I'm talking about.

[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:36.980]
What is it?

[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.620]
That's why I call it the logic complaint.

[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.260]
What complaint about what?

[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:40.400]

[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:47.240]
What's the point on Marlon Springtrain and baseball and let you go home when we need to tear here you until two o'clock.

[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:48.580]
I don't know.

[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:49.560]
Six o'clock.

[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.020]
Six o'clock as you know.

[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:51.460]
That's unbelievable.

[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.360]
The tough life.

[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:58.680]
And then you got to listen to the sports team with like five Brazilian commercials and there's no, you know, they...

[00:45:58.680 --> 00:45:59.180]
You know what I mean?

[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.020]
You don't have to listen to it.

[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:01.580]
You're wrong about that.

[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:02.840]
Why do you say that?

[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:03.700]
You have to listen to it.

[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:04.700]
No you're right exactly.

[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:08.840]
I put it on the phone this morning sitting here observing between nine and 10 a.m.

[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:12.240]
A little bit more to your hour putting up with those 30 minutes of spots in our.

[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:16.420]
You know what I did Neil put it put some country on then I'd hit it back over about every ten minutes.

[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:17.120]
A commercial.

[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:17.980]
A commercial.

[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:18.600]
It's all they got.

[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:19.460]
It's all spots radio.

[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.360]
And then I heard...

[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:25.140]
I wonder who has to do with that is it either road screw in or...

[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:25.340]
Roll!

[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:28.300]
Or maybe the two of them decided that together when they were holding their meat together.

[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.260]
Somebody at your stations were really screwing up.

[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.360]
But Neil I wanted to talk to you about one thing.

[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.580]
Have you ever watched TLC the learning channel?

[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:34.940]
Yeah.

[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:36.860]
Have you ever seen trauma in the ER?

[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:37.460]
No.

[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.060]
That's an excellent show.

[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:42.760]
It's about live in the emergency room and you're talking about Jack of working.

[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:47.400]
Anyway this guy in Hawaii takes two kitchen knives about 12 inches long.

[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:50.880]
Stabs himself in the chest, one and then the other.

[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.840]
He pulls them both out and he's not dead yet so he sticks them both out.

[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.100]
Oh he buries them down to the handle and he's still alive.

[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:01.640]
Okay listen if you come by before 1230 we'll show you the Kunehaan in picture.

[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.460]
It's just like Sam the Sam our promotions man.

[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.920]
Seriously I mean I wasn't exaggerating people thought that was just making that up.

[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:13.880]
It looks exactly in fact Sam is walking around like a ghost because of the starling resemblance of a Kunehaan.

[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.020]
Okay that's a good looking guy.

[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.800]
Well even with the blood on his push is that what you're saying?

[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:18.380]
Uh huh.

[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:20.440]
WQAM hello.

[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:21.620]
Neil.

[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:22.180]
Yes sir.

[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.000]
Good afternoon.

[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:23.560]
Wait a minute.

[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:29.000]
Last week you were talking about old announcers in youth as well as an old trans planet Pittsburgher.

[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.580]
Did you ever find that well print stuff?

[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:32.720]
I played it yesterday.

[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:33.320]
Oh we.

[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:33.840]
One of the cards.

[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:35.140]
We missed it you know.

[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.340]
Oh come on.

[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.360]
Can we have a little bit now?

[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:40.700]
Yeah so I got this a little bit.

[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:42.300]
Keep it in the sky busy George.

[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:43.700]
Oh my god.

[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.180]
It's a different one than I had in the rich you haven't know what it is.

[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.080]
It's short but it's authentic anyway.

[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:49.700]
Thank you Neil.

[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.580]
Okay have a great day.

[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.800]
I played it yesterday just for this guy wasn't listening.

[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.040]
It's wrong with you man.

[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.700]
Score tied three three in the bottom of the 17th.

[00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:58.680]
One ball and one strike.

[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.680]
Whom's into the wind up in the one one pitch?

[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:03.700]
Swine on.

[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.120]
17th to right field.

[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.900]
You can't kiss it goodbye.

[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.680]
Oh baby did he get that baby out of sight.

[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:16.920]
He created it.

[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.140]
Greatest broadcast through in the history of baseball Bob Prince.

[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:21.620]
The late to great he was the best.

[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:22.840]
I don't care what anybody else said.

[00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.420]
Not a matter of opinion when.

[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.980]
Yeah it tells you that makes it fact.

[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:27.380]
Okay.

[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:29.280]
There was nobody like Bob Prince.

[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.060]
And never will be.

[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.460]
I mean he was no Bob Costa.

[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:33.700]
Thank God.

[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.320]
Little ass looking twerp.

[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.620]
By the way ever see you Bob Costa and Geldy together?

[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:38.880]
No.

[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:40.540]
WQAM.

[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:40.820]
Hello.

[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:42.820]
QAM.

[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:44.560]
WQAM.

[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:44.780]
Hello.

[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.000]
Hang up your head.

[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:48.920]
How you doing Neil?

[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:49.420]
Okay sir.

[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.040]
I was trying to get in yesterday.

[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:56.560]
There's a picture on yesterday's held sports in the top left hand corner on the front page.

[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:56.940]
Yeah.

[00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:58.880]
You were talking about the gay.

[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:00.960]
Gods and stuff.

[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:01.280]
Yeah.

[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:06.880]
Well there's two basketball players on the ground and one of them's got his hand right where.

[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:08.880]
Right where the moon don't try.

[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:10.420]
On the other side.

[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.100]
Not there but on the other in the front.

[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:12.940]
In the front.

[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:13.380]
Yes.

[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:14.300]
In the general.

[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.140]
In the general area.

[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:17.920]
In the frontal area.

[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.000]
Oh my god.

[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:19.640]
Get that picture.

[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.360]
I tried to get in yesterday but I got.

[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.660]
What I tell you about all these sports, all these macho guys.

[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.820]
It's a great cover up but it's not fooling me anymore.

[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.260]
They were going to block too many times.

[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:28.400]
All this grab ass stuff.

[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.180]
Guys running around.

[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:30.760]
Grabbing each other around the waist.

[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:31.220]
Oh man.

[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.400]
They were having a few of them.

[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:32.980]
They were having a way.

[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:35.260]
Yeah well I don't want to be too personal.

[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:35.600]
There were two big parts.

[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.320]
Two big sparsers.

[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:37.520]
Yeah.

[00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:39.500]
Each other's a f***ing thing.

[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:39.920]
Exactly.

[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:40.640]
In clothing.

[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:41.320]
Yes sir.

[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:41.920]
Mike.

[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.500]
You're a park deliverance.

[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:44.820]
Skinnered loving butt plugs.

[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:45.320]
I got.

[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:45.640]
I got.

[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:46.360]
Sweet home Alabama.

[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:47.060]
There you go.

[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:47.860]
Let's go over to Tampa.

[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:48.940]
Watch a hockey game.

[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:52.040]
At least those people over there know a team when they see one.

[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.080]
Of course they're not going any workers.

[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:54.320]
They don't have one but nevertheless.

[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:56.260]
It made some actually pretty good deals.

[00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:56.640]
The lightning.

[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:57.560]
I don't want to talk about them.

[00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:57.980]
It's boring.

[00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.620]
Better than we did.

[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.220]
They got that keep Colin Forbes from Philadelphia.

[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.880]
Two goals this first game for lightning.

[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:03.580]
Good player.

[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:04.240]
There's a player.

[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:06.900]
Why don't anybody ask me about Mike Wilson last night.

[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:07.640]
Don't ask me please.

[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:07.940]
Okay.

[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:10.320]
Give him a chance.

[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:10.900]
I'm going to give him a rough night.

[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:11.640]
He'll be alright.

[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.140]
He's got too much crap in Buffalo.

[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:14.960]
Let's give him a week then we'll rip his ass.

[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.020]
Pretty weak Mike.

[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:18.540]
Somebody give him a compass in the road map.

[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:20.480]
WQAM.

[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:20.720]
Hello.

[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:23.840]
WQAM.

[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:24.080]
Hello.

[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:26.260]
WQAM.

[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:26.500]
Hello.

[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:26.580]

[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:26.580]

[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:27.560]
Neil.

[00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:28.080]
Yes sir.

[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:29.920]
I got another great job for you.

[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:30.220]
Yes.

[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.680]
Man they're working ten salons and man they go to ten salons.

[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:35.220]
Yeah.

[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:39.320]
Well going to a ten in salons isn't a job unless you know you do it like every day.

[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.660]
And get paid for it.

[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.820]
Well they're men who work in ten in salons.

[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.900]
The one that they do is that like you are working in the bath house.

[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:45.620]
Yeah.

[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:46.680]
Like in a towel boy.

[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.600]
You're cleaning up after them.

[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.140]
Okay.

[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.260]
We'll say hi to your local ten in guy.

[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:53.040]
He obviously must know.

[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:53.600]
Huh?

[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.960]
Why does the Julio have to go to a ten in salons anyway.

[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.100]
Aren't most other than you of course since you're the one exception.

[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:00.600]
Yeah I'm the one.

[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:01.900]
What?

[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:03.160]
No sir.

[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:07.300]
The most Julios have like a pretty good darkened complexion.

[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:08.320]
Dependent where they're from.

[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.020]
Yeah.

[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:09.620]
How about Leavon?

[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.900]
He's got a real dark complexion.

[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:11.360]
He'd be black.

[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.280]
He'd be Cuban.

[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:14.600]
Black Cubans.

[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.580]
We have lots of them.

[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.340]
Is that hyphenated in a lot of slaves?

[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.160]
Is he African black Cuban?

[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.200]
Somebody had to cut the cake.

[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.220]
Is he African Cuban?

[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:22.980]
He's a Cuban African.

[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.560]
I'll tell you what that reporter from Channel 51 said about Leavon.

[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:27.320]
He's an asshole.

[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:28.720]
WQA and hello.

[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:29.820]
Yeah.

[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:30.320]
How are you?

[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:33.300]
I'm the guy who got the ticket yesterday.

[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:34.160]
Right in.

[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:35.780]
Yeah I'm calling him thank you.

[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:39.300]
Well sorry about the game but we can't you know we can't supply the win too you know.

[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:41.100]
Yeah I was looking for you I couldn't find you.

[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:43.200]
Wouldn't that find me with that maple leaf jacket on?

[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.380]
How could you not find me everybody else does?

[00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:47.060]
I didn't know what section you said I.

[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:47.300]
101.

[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:48.940]
Seat what?

[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:54.140]
Right there on the top row right right by the stairs.

[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.340]
Oh I thought it was 107 little six.

[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.420]
Yeah well you didn't miss anything.

[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.180]
Yeah I know I was kind of depressed.

[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:02.000]
Well I'm glad you at least showed up anyway and have a great life now.

[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.600]
Oh by the way I want to say hi to my good buddy Wally Hennessey.

[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:08.260]
You know I'm talking to my friend Sean and this one and that one last night you know in between periods.

[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:15.020]
And the guy comes running down shakes my hand and you know and and before I just barely get a chance to turn around and see what was and he's running away.

[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.520]
Of course I know why you're running away Wally.

[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.740]
I haven't cast a ticket on you in about two years at Pompoot O Park.

[00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:22.660]
My good buddy Wally Hennessey from Nova Scotia.

[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.500]
I want to tell you something and he's a good guy okay he really is.

[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.120]
In spite of some of those races he's a good guy.

[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:40.440]
But there's such a thing as a I'm not talking French Canadian because a lot of you people are really dumb and you don't know the difference between a frog and the English speaking Canadians which thank God are a different breed.

[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:46.560]
But if you wanted to have a picture of a definitive Canadian from Nova Scotia and the list from PE on Wally Hennessey.

[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.600]
How's it going A? I mean there is he is Canadian.

[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:55.020]
Say what you want about Wally and driving his horses at Pompoot O and everywhere else which he's been all over the world and done great.

[00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.300]
But he is so Canadian.

[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:00.040]
Hey Wally how about a horse tonight huh?

[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:05.240]
How about just one winner all these years have been plunging my brains out losing my ass huh?

[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:08.860]
Just one winner at Pompoot O Park tonight Wally when you give me a winner.

[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:09.940]
I will not give it to you.

[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:11.380]
Well that's your took a long time.

[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.360]
By the way what happened to the excellent Wally?

[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.000]
Why are you airing shit like this?

[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.500]
Have you ever heard a popular rap song in the radio and thought?

[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:20.420]
Heck I could do that here or go.

[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:21.560]
You're probably right.

[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:25.700]
All it takes is a little ambition some karaoke-esque musical backup and 1995.

[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.720]
Yes I left a talent for a reason.

[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:32.940]
With a puff daddy rap along CD set you'll be hitting it just like some of the top rap stars of today.

[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:33.880]
Oh yeah.

[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:35.260]
A back and black.

[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:35.840]
Yeah.

[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:42.300]
With little to no musical talent and even the less creative fencing you'll be a chart buster in mere weeks.

[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.220]
Oh yeah.

[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:44.920]
It's the time of your life.

[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:45.440]
Yeah.

[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:52.080]
The puff daddy rap along CD set even comes with a handy booklet that shows you how to get older rock stars to help you with your projects.

[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:52.880]
Oh yeah.

[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:54.440]
I've got to get it.

[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:54.620]
Yeah.

[00:53:55.660 --> 00:54:00.440]
The puff daddy rap along CD set just 1995 is just about all it takes.

[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:01.880]
Okay.

[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.760]
It's 11.15 is 5.

[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:04.640]
Boy that sure was abrupt.

[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.680]
When that 5.60 WDQM hanged on after the ball game from Shulas.

[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.860]
Which end about 4 o'clock?

[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:09.180]
Okay.

[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:10.560]
That's when you can tune back in.

[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:11.100]
I mean.

[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.140]
Like we used to see on SUN remember check back with us a later.

[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:19.180]
Well what kind of rejoins were those you know check back with us later for the Rick and such.

[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:22.080]
You'll check back with us later on for the sports bitch.

[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:22.440]
Yeah.

[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:23.140]
What was that?

[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:28.060]
That was no picking Tampa mentality radio check back with us later.

[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:31.720]
We know you're going to turn off now but check back what doesn't see if you like it later on.

[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:36.440]
Because we know you're going to turn it off at 12.50 am I right when the ball game comes on?

[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:43.720]
There is nobody who cares about the Marlins not anybody even John Henry ain't going to be listening WQAM.

[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.160]
Hello.

[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:45.260]

[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:46.780]
Hey Neil.

[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:48.240]
Back in 1986.

[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.400]
I bought a condo and well bananas.

[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:51.000]

Well anyway.

[00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:03.700]
What's the answer?

[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:04.420]
I'm not going to guess.

[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:07.000]
What are you saying sir?

[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.760]
They have little flags in the back of their car.

[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:11.620]
They have little one.

[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:13.240]
Little rainbow flags.

[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:14.340]
Queens?

[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:14.980]
Yes.

[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:15.700]
Fags?

[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:16.260]
Yes.

[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:17.060]
Monocones?

[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:17.820]
Yes.

[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:25.580]
Because if the property value is going up through cakes and the border right now is all old people.

[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:26.040]
Yeah.

[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:27.500]
One of them got on the ballot right?

[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:28.100]
Yeah.

[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:30.400]
And one of what one of the monocones?

[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:30.960]
Yes.

[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:35.680]
One of them got on the ballot and all the old people are in their very serious.

[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:36.620]
Oh.

[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.140]
And there are no old Queens.

[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:39.140]
Well no.

[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:42.600]
There are no commandos are all serious.

[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:43.060]
Anyway.

[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.120]
There's no one around.

[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:46.340]
No matter how we're in county and you'll find there's no old Queens.

[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:47.440]
There's no old trolls.

[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:48.360]
No.

[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:48.860]
Anyway.

[00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:49.200]
Anyway.

[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:50.440]
Anyway.

[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:54.340]
So what do you think about the old people?

[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:59.120]
They're all going to everybody's apartment and spreading bad rumors about the guy saying that.

[00:55:59.120 --> 00:55:59.280]
Yeah.

[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:00.700]
Well, good.

[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:01.640]
I love the old people.

[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:03.020]
They're all moving out.

[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:03.040]

[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:04.000]
Let the Queens move in.

[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:04.900]
They'll illustrate up the neighborhood.

[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:05.280]
Okay.

[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:06.780]
One thing about us.

[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:07.260]
Fags.

[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.480]
The neighborhood is always nice and clean and lovely.

[00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:10.680]
I mean, really lovely.

[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:14.040]
As opposed to when certain other elements move in.

[00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:16.100]
WQAM.

[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:16.380]
Hello.

[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:17.080]
A.M.

[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:17.740]
Yes sir.

[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.440]
Can you say coma inducing last night?

[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:20.320]
No.

[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:21.960]
I might as everybody said that.

[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:23.360]
I didn't think it was that bad of a game.

[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:23.940]
You don't?

[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:24.440]
No.

[00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:26.780]
We all felt fleeing.

[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:28.080]
Everybody said that.

[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.700]
That was just a horrible game.

[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.900]
I don't see why you say that.

[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:33.520]
I mean, maybe because I've seen so many of them, they really were horrible.

[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:37.180]
At least, and by the way, I tell you this kid Dan Boyle, let's go to the gold of the Fedsman.

[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:38.180]
This kid is great.

[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:39.500]
He can skate like the wind.

[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:41.280]
He's good all the way around.

[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:41.900]
I like that kid.

[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:43.100]
Whitney still putting on the move.

[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:44.040]
Whitney is good.

[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.980]
But of course, when you put it right there for Coslo, they shoot to 10 feet wide.

[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.280]
I mean, what are you going to do on from a little ray?

[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:48.720]
He's trying.

[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:52.740]
He and Melon, but you cannot Melon be for being slow, which he is.

[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:55.080]
At least he gives you a 200% effort there, you know?

[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.620]
There was one problem.

[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:20.100]
I like that.

[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:21.060]

thanks bye bye see those are the days when sportscasters weren't just these

[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:13.880]
plastic voices like today you know all sound the same the ballpark all look the same

[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:18.120]
the new hockey and basketball arena they all look the same all prefabricated

[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.680]
no character no pizzazz no personality

[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.960]
those days you had your early harwell and harry carry in male allen and bob

[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:32.220]
prince and i mean the list went on and on and on great broadcasters they were

[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:36.200]
artistic linguist they were great cut a linguist not these guys that it is dumb ex

[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:36.820]

just just loaded i mean you know the fact that you played the game and this is the

[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:58.380]
problem is the sports fans the so-called fans they're more on

[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:03.160]
you want somebody to contain a verbal picture even when you're watching a game on

[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:07.300]
television i don't want to watch like those ranger games with sam rosy and jd

[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:10.280]
that that that that that that that that described the game okay anyone to hear

[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:13.580]
about you know your nose and about jd ego and about how what you had for dinner

[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:17.560]
night i want to hear somebody describe the game so if i get up and i walk in the

[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.300]
kitchen eat us a lot of sandwich i still know what's going on

[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:25.980]
somebody who really verbally paints a picture of them of the broadcast as opposed

[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:28.800]
to somebody who's sitting there picking their nose like Christina moron

[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:32.640]
which i wouldn't even put him in the same category with the i can't think of

[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:37.680]

this was like a real market with real newspapers which it's not so much stuff is going down and you know all the only place they

[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:35.980]
can fight out about the stuff is on this show because all of these things are happening and nobody's writing about them

[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:41.880]
because Tom jicke you know he's too important for that he's been there with a satellite dish story which is hidden

[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:49.860]
in the business section which nobody reads poor Tom you know he used to he used to have some clue is to what was going on you

lies that they have to plan the game they're still doing that there's still running

[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:36.880]
I would be a top live spot in ball games for people at both the near Rogers show and they're

[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:40.580]
doing the bait and switch and running their spots and exhibition Marlon games that nobody's listening

[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:17.600]
only cry how's that go WQAM hello QAM WQAM hello yes sir just a quick question you're always

[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:23.500]
complaining about me never complain never complain sir okay your mother taught me that you're

[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:29.260]
discussing the problems with your equipment and your phones yeah that's right even today

[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:33.880]
Georgia's phone doesn't work with a crap in there that's right exactly my question is to you

[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:41.360]
you send a hangout to Las Vegas I don't send hangout anywhere okay okay hangout hangout the radio

[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:45.380]
let me show you okay the radio station sends him all over the place right over the place right now

[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:51.260]
that cost tons of money to set up equipment to send people out of flight that's right right that's

[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:56.640]
right oh yeah why don't they just I mean you're the number one person on that show because

[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:03.140]
we're gonna serve I'll give you the answer there is no sir let me get a new phone I answer the

[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:07.520]
question out here because you're rooting you keep interrupting me because there is no commitment to

[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:12.500]
this show I've said I say and you said I'm always complaining because of that fact when we're

[01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:16.280]
downstairs on the second floor there was no commitment now they're up here with all the rest there's

[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:20.760]
still no commitment and I asked Georgia this morning about the thing with the phone lines about

[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.880]
with his broken phone and oh well it's on a ticket with the phone company there's another

[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:29.320]
words on the list of them to do things someday if they get around to a real radio station don't

[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:33.980]
sit back for that because this has to do with our livelihood this has to be a priority real

[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:38.020]
program directors and real engineers and real management people don't take that for an answer

[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:42.920]
from southern bell or anybody else they say we you need to be in here now because this is

[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:47.580]
impeding our ability to do business and believe me with the right kind of imply threats they show

[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:53.380]
up in a hurry which we've discovered but that doesn't happen here because there's no commitment to

[01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:56.840]
excellence there's no commitment I don't know I have no idea what that's all about I was thinking

[01:20:56.840 --> 01:21:00.560]
about that the other day Hank was mentioning that he you know he's going today he's at yours which

[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:04.100]
is finally gonna you know that doesn't cost the same thing over there maybe we make money I don't

[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:10.500]
we make bread on that but now he's going over to the final four in Tampa tomorrow for the next four

[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:16.720]
days the next Friday and Monday and yes that does cost money there's expense and I don't

[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:20.280]
be grudge Hank anything I mean all the you know strippers he can get in mom's penis whatever you

[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:24.300]
know what he's gonna all the meals at Bernstake House more power to him no problem with that

[01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:29.020]
but if you're gonna if you're gonna lay out that kind of bread to do these things then how come

[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:32.360]
why not make a commitment like when they didn't have a phone in the studio in there for the end

[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:36.220]
that's just for us for the whole sports station they didn't have a goddamn telephone in the

[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:41.000]
studio to communicate with the outside world and with each other didn't have a dump

[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.440]
button for the honor talent in the in the talk studio for the sports there shows I mean there's

[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:50.040]
what didn't all of these things like I said still don't

[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:56.320]
isn't that pathetic and that's why I go on here and do these things because you'll notice

[01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:01.140]
after a while after I scream loud enough and even with them there's an embarrassment factor I know

[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:05.400]
that comes in the shock but even with them eventually duck its desk I don't have to pay for it

[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:09.200]
eventually they get their small dish I don't have to pay for it but when I threaten the pay for

[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:15.660]
stuff it's like putting a big spotlight on how cheat Greg Reed and the beesleaves are and how

[01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:20.580]
niggerly they try to run this operation giving us nothing to work with okay guys make magic make

[01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:23.920]
us a lot of money here you go like you wind up a dollar and you know turn it loose

[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:29.860]
seriously that's their concept of doing these shows is like winding up an alarm clock and letting

[01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:34.780]
it light like you know winding up that thing with the those little things that those guys made for us

[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:40.440]
you know I like the walking penis the walking penis so guys right just wind them up and let them

[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:44.740]
us through their brains out and we're the ones that gain the screwing that's the bad part and

[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:51.080]
we even feel good because we got a real real real cheat skate run in this joint and you know

[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:56.520]
hey I don't know if he is a cheat skate I really don't know all right what I think he is is

[01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:01.540]
basically a figurehead a wannabe like I said before not a bad guy but a wannabe the cheat skates are

[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:05.000]
the beesleaves over their naples and then you know when some of that's why the day that Hank was on

[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.920]
their suck and their ass it just made me nauseous I don't care how many concerts they watch together

[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:12.880]
I don't care what nice guys they were or what pace the old Austin versus they were wearing in a

[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:18.740]
guy named skybox I'm sorry these are not business people these are these are fraud from the business

[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:25.000]
people from hell pay their bills whatever they get around you get your bonus check by the way George

[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:30.100]
did I get my money for the panthers to put my down payment on the playoff tickets I get that

[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:37.620]
this down this check no employee the month uh check did you get it no say it again no

[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:43.920]
this is the way they do things and that's why I go on here and scream like Vladimir because I'm

[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:48.360]
not going to be just a suckling like most of these other whims that work in his place and like I

[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:52.460]
said if I had some support around here instead of a bunch of people I want to suck ass and suck

[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.280]
ass you know the deal is they pay you you know if they pay a lot of money it's one of because they

[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:59.480]
agree to it in the contract not because they want to because they had a pay of that amount

[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:02.640]
in order to get you to work here to bring in all the money that makes them a profit I'd like

[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:05.880]
to ball games that they're losing their ass on like the one that's going to be on there unless

[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:10.980]
then an hour that they're losing their ass on which is why they're in court with that big thing

[01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:16.460]
going on with Wayne and this one that's why all that's going on want to buy any Marlon's spot no

inner is right now just thinking about marlin's baseball wow whoo heavy duty can't help it man it's

[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:24.860]
part of the uh deal it's part of our and of course do we have the regular season schedule yet no for

[01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:31.640]
the marlin oh and by the way I'm sure glad I fumbled my way and remembering this do we have our marlin

[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:04.360]

all over the place we have ours yet oh no George have his uh employee of the month check for $200

[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:19.940]
I'm a happy camper okay I'm just a mild mannered like Clark Kent and I got the glasses to prove it okay

[01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:25.500]
but when people appear on your parade you can't just back and be a pussy all your life

[01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:30.700]
you got to open up your mouth and speak out hey stupid don't take crap from these vases don't let

[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:35.040]
them pay whatever they get around wouldn't feel like it that's why they got money to buy those damn

[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:38.340]
three-piece suits at Goodwill because they're using that money where they could have been paying us

[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:43.200]
where do you think they got that big family dumpster they all sleep in at night

[01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:47.820]

[01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:06.600]

[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:10.080]
I'm not going to go on I like that picked up cold when you at least expect it

[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:15.400]
that's right um the one one thing no one ever mentioned about your list it just keeps growing and growing

[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:20.520]
it keeps getting bigger man it's welling out before standing it's gigantic it's like a one-way snake

[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:28.400]
any any man that works with the garbage getting bigger like an a pulse grower or like drape re-guys

[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:34.320]
right oh my goodness you want to see these guys walking around Queens yeah anyway too long

[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:38.180]
it's interesting what we should have done is subdivided because they're like lumberjacks truck drivers

[01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:42.900]
these are like your macho queen you know saying these are macho gay guys right athletes people like

[01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:47.360]
that yeah but then there's also like interior decorators and what you're talking about tend to be like

[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:51.640]
a little more flavors yeah a little bit you know they're kind of a lean skinny kind of you know

[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:55.740]
flavors yeah a little weak looking guy well let's say you know the way it is that's right we can't

[01:42:55.740 --> 01:43:00.260]
be macho like a guilty you know also did I hear you correctly yesterday her was at the day before

[01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:05.300]
I care remember um you were saying something that there was evidence that Jerry fall had paid out

[01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:09.000]
for the like two hundred thousand dollars yeah over the last right for for a very

[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.580]
lot of people make up stories about Clinton right just just like Susan Mcdonald yesterday

[01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:17.320]
testified that her husband was trying to coerce her in a testifying making up that she slept with

[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:21.640]
Clinton all these other stories all these things right isn't there anything that that can be done

[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:25.700]

territory about eighty five acres just to get to where they used to have the toilet seats and they

[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:28.440]
had about four of them left and I think they were like for the outhouse in hell and there was some

[01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:32.340]
there were definitely not for my toilet so thanks again to my good close personal friend out there

[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:50.680]
the reason why I called right but uh anybody yeah uh anybody mentioned eight doctors

[01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:55.900]
proctologist yeah man I said that I said that yesterday there was really on the list yeah

[01:52:55.900 --> 01:53:01.900]
they did my mind didn't look like much of a queer or anything but he really took a sweet ass time

[01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:07.240]
getting around time to play on words yeah what do you find anything in there uh yeah did he

[01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:12.580]
linger did he linger a little bit too long did his finger linger a little bit too long well his

[01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:18.040]
finger was the lingering and his assistance was uh giving me the eye uh huh well at least it felt

[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:21.380]
like a finger anyway no seriously we were talking about that the other day and I never got a chance

[01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:25.540]
to mention on the air when you shake hands with somebody like when you shake hands with a guy

[01:53:25.980 --> 01:53:32.020]
and he his hand lingers a little bit too long do you know what I'm saying that happens to me all the

[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:36.340]
time like last night at the hockey game I didn't happen last night I met a lot of nice people so a lot of

[01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:41.700]
people I've met before it said everyone so on good to see a Sean but anyway oh seriously there

[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:46.660]
a lot of you know and there's some people you meet now this happens very very frequently maybe

[01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:52.780]
it's because uh I don't know but they hold your hand a little bit too long I don't I don't go for that

[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:57.540]
I mean if I hold your hand longer than you feel necessary there's probably a message in there and

[01:53:57.540 --> 01:54:04.240]
most of you it won't happen but oh seriously I don't like that do you the doesn't it can you know

[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:09.200]
I wouldn't he brought it up the willies I mean it gives me the creeps when that happens same thing with hugs

yeah that's enough somebody will hug you and uh you know three little pat on the back that's the

[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:17.740]
point I'll tell you who hugged me that I never met before and I hugged him because we felt like we

[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:23.000]

[01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:49.700]

[01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:37.660]
necessarily brush your teeth with the same hand you handle your goods with believe me but uh

[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:43.580]
and a sci-fi one and I know there was about the only one they had why there is a really outstanding

[01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:48.480]
great product everybody should go out immediately if not sooner in fact how come dentists all over

[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:52.740]
America all you dentists and all you hygienists are recommending you know in fact the line why was

[01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:58.360]
it the dentist last week so she cleansed my teeth and at the end she hands me a real thin crest

[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:03.120]
uh toothbrush you know it was like a quarter of an ounce and I realized they bring in about

[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:09.280]
50 thousand votes for all the dentist offices and they get them for nothing but why yeah that's

[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:16.180]
my question for you dentist out there yeah exactly including my good friend Dr. Gary why yeah can

[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:25.820]
you do it again okay 1242 at 560 as she was tickled by that WQAM hello QAM

[01:58:27.260 --> 01:58:32.460]
nobody QAM hello you think we could go the whole season without the Marlin's broadcast crew say good

[01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:41.300]
seats good seats are still available oh I think the answer you're looking for is no no chance no way

[01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:47.840]
Jose oh look at this we're coming up on it baby 1243 I see I like it not for me if I'm leaving

[01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:52.480]
town you know like when it lets you do the 20 minutes and I hop on a plane I get out of here but

[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:57.500]
knowing that tomorrow is Friday and I kind of come back I resent that because it's costing us

[01:58:57.500 --> 01:59:01.900]
money and it's taken away bitching time that I could be sitting your screaming and yelling and maybe

[01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:05.280]
embarrassing them into getting your phone fixed in there and doing something about all this other

[01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:13.520]
all these things well I'll tell you the best piece we got in here is because that's perfect I took

[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:18.740]
us 14 and a half months almost 15 months to get that but that's the definitive answer you get for

[01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:23.660]
any any question we're gonna get that phone pick yeah they get in the dump button for the talent

[01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:28.520]
there in the sports video yeah I'm gonna get that the bone of that check for George for his

[01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:33.840]
employee of the month yeah how about that money for my for my playoff tickets for the Panthers

[01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:47.360]

Kelly blows oh I can yeah goalie scope this is a good day for it sir nice timing eight to five to

[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:08.320]
San Jose right there in the air Canada center we're losing every day now home games road games

[02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:13.400]
unscheduled games one good game they played in the last six weeks that was the Jersey game Saturday

[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:18.960]
even a couple of games we won they sliced them up in the media for playing so bad you know it's one

[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:23.460]
thing to go through a little bit of a swoon but it's another thing to just you know you start getting

[02:00:23.460 --> 02:00:28.100]
a little bit nervous because we've had too many of these false alarms in the past let's get back on

[02:00:28.100 --> 02:00:32.680]
the get back with it and by the way let's quit putting Mary heely in the next two last night seven

[02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:37.020]
goals the one empty netter we don't count seven goals last night Mary and I saw some of the low

[02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:40.680]
lights I could have stopped those and by the way Kelly know I wouldn't run away from a puck

[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:46.840]
w-c-a-m hello in fact I'm the guy to cut the baseball between my knees at the uh you of

[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:53.580]
m well what does he know by name w-c-a-m hello nail yes sir hey don't okay you know I'm so

[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:59.300]
discussed with the panthers and in why is that because you know I think it about well there

[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:04.580]
you run in the organization into the ground everybody's making trades and we run out into the

[02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:08.780]
ground we had a cell out last night it was a lot it's passed over it's you know there was

[02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:12.900]
it but every ticket was sold I don't want a lot of empty seats compared to most games that

[02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:17.280]
place was jammed the product sucks though yeah I understand that but don't you understand they don't

[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:21.700]
care about that as long as people keep showing up filling an ass in every seat they don't care

[02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:27.540]
obviously it's so damn expensive because she watched that crap right right I agreed they got a

[02:01:27.540 --> 02:01:31.520]
mediocre team there's no question and again a lot of mistakes they made signing long-term

[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:36.240]
Kirk Mueller Garpenloff all these stiffs and we're stuck with them until we can either they either

[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:40.760]
croak or we trade them or are their contract runs out and you know and you know Chris Wells

[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:46.140]
that project Chris Wells yeah and any other company Brian Murray would have been fired a year ago

[02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:52.160]
right and it's ridiculous well yes well what the hell he doing up there he's switching both

[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:58.660]
ties every five minutes that's right right right right okay yeah the panthers aren't too happy in

[02:01:58.660 --> 02:02:03.100]
case you guys in the organized and we still can't see here we are we only got a few home games left

[02:02:03.100 --> 02:02:06.780]

[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:16.520]

[02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:23.720]
rudimentary elements rotor rudder elements well it's almost that time I want to make sure I do

[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:28.540]

[02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:18.960]
people are calling uh I have been calling constantly saying that you know you always get when

[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:23.580]
you come back from a break you always get cut off the first and second though uh maybe they

[02:03:23.580 --> 02:03:29.900]
don't understand seven second delay meaning what well meaning that uh you guys are on a delay

[02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:33.920]
and maybe maybe they haven't figured that out yet okay okay you're following what he's saying

[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:38.580]
course not no because they're what it is he's on the difference between the delay and getting

[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:43.580]
chopped off okay I mean if there any you guys in four minors want to come over here we'll be glad

[02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:52.220]

or death the answer came in the barless once their payments contractual agreement must be

[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:42.820]
meant despite the trading if they have to pay the pay and hope they find that all the

[02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:51.980]
things are dead and the cars and they fall I think it's sad with cars and they fall I'd rather hear
