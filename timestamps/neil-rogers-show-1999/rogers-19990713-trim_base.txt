[00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.780]
Hey, we're going to lose more than 60.

[00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.200]
516-WAM, my amoeba water nail, presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.540]
To down to Neil, call 567-056-Toll-Free for Danden Browder or pound 560 on your cell phone.

[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.280]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show do not necessarily

[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.180]
reflect those of WQAM easily read acquisitions or the easily broadcast group.

[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.300]
Now, Neil Rogers on sports radio 560-QAM.

[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.740]
Nobody repulses you more.

[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.700]
All right.

[00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:25.160]
On the move seems like M hebbenbribe is in silence.

[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.240]
You should be scared of me

[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.940]
Okay

[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.660]
Cause you could go to jail and just be with me

[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.760]
If I'm free, you and the friends of me

[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.400]
She was 25 but she's just a few

[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.560]
No safety, I've been my last afraid

[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.120]
Daddy called a cosmonaut

[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.740]
So I just thought perfect to see

[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.580]
Because I've had such a big

[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.580]
No more my curse, which by me

[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.800]
Never do things right around

[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.700]
Oh my show

[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.740]
Left on me

[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.140]
She's underage

[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.900]
She okay?

[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.520]
Oh

[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.180]
She should be scared of me

[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.580]
You're the missing one

[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.740]
And you're the most friendlier than time and time

[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.820]
Oh, what a sight

[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.880]
She's looking right

[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.220]
She's looking right

[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.440]
She looks just a few

[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.820]
But she's just a few

[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.780]
That was 3560 WQM Happy Tuesday to you

[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.060]
I know the overheads a little bit hog

[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.480]
I got a cranked up because I love that song

[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.580]
I don't love the song

[00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.800]
I love the parody that I just played

[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.260]
Which is much better than the real song

[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.980]
Which he couldn't sing a word of a paper sack

[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.180]
But does anybody care about that?

[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.420]
No

[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.040]
Of course not

[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.620]
Because she's got a great ass

[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.820]
And she looks pretty good

[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.000]
And even if they aren't for real

[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.380]
Who cares?

[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.400]
Does anybody care if they're...

[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.560]
No

[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.980]
No

[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.200]
Anyway, getting back to what they were saying right there

[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.860]
Which I never do

[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.840]
But we had to monitor up

[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.760]
So you couldn't help but hear what they didn't want to hear it or not

[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.340]
Which I didn't

[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.960]
But nevertheless at the end of the worst team there this morning

[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.880]
See the thing it is

[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.020]
And it ties them with everything else that goes on with this town

[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.520]
And that is

[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.320]
That no matter how you slap the public in the face

[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.940]
There are always enough assholes to perpetuate the stupidity

[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.700]
It would be like if I opened up a restaurant

[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.580]
I said you know something

[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.640]
The food is really going to suck

[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.280]
The prices are going to be too high

[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.260]
The food is going to taste like crap

[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.280]
And I opened up the doors and people come in

[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.160]
And they're buying my sloth

[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.120]
Yeah, I mean not

[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.040]
It's not like loaded

[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.200]
It's not like jam packed like McDonald's and places like that

[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.800]
But nevertheless

[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.340]
There are people you know

[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.480]
A steady flow of customers

[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.060]
And I'm like eating out a living

[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.580]
And I get out there in front on the street with a megaphone

[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.060]
And I say

[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.680]
Don't you people understand the food here

[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.140]
If at least the next couple of years

[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.820]
It's going to suck and the prices are too high

[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.020]
And it keeps showing up

[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.820]
That's what's going on here with this Marlon bull crap

[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.480]
That's the problem we got crazy people here

[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.080]
I must be crazy, I must be nuts

[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.240]
Yeah you too John

[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.260]
Yeah

[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.360]
Crazy people in this town

[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.720]
That's why this thing with Mayor Rapingo

[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.200]
Who definitely ought to be in jail after the last 24 hours

[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.080]
I'm convinced he ought to be on death row at least

[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.420]
That's why they're going to pull the wool over the eyes of this public

[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.760]
And push this thing through

[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.700]
And wait a year this

[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.060]
If you haven't already heard the statement he released yesterday

[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.180]
About the 75,000 toll boats that we're going to have

[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.860]
If you don't give him his penny sales tax

[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.700]
Not that it's blackmail you understand

[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.880]
No

[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.200]
It's unbelievable

[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.280]
And see again

[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.400]
Who are the people that are really causing the problems

[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.080]
That are getting sucked into all the panic

[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.940]
Like some jackass they interviewed this morning on Channel 4

[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.040]
Of course I'm sure he was the only motorist out there

[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.360]
Available on the highway to be interviewed

[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.540]
But he's the one that we see

[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.180]
In his BMW or whatever it was driving

[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.720]
Oh I don't care if it's two cents three cents

[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.300]
Whatever the sales tax is just to get the grid of these tolls and let me drive

[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.120]
And I'm thinking to myself God damn it

[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.660]
They're going to suck the public and they're going to pull this off

[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.760]
They're going to pull this off

[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.960]
Even as transparent as it is

[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.600]
But getting back to the idiots again

[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.460]
The morons

[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.680]
Just like the few thousand people that keep showing up for those Marlon games

[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.100]
Even though they keep coming out and saying

[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.140]
Oh we're going to stink

[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.980]
We're not going to win

[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.640]
We're terrible

[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.960]
We're a bunch of lug up

[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.060]
Little puffy kids

[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.400]
And every time we get somebody that you like we're going to trade him away

[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.080]
Even if they are still young guys

[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.120]
And not making a lot of money

[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.820]
We don't care

[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.400]
And they still keep showing up

[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.240]
And it's the same with these idiots

[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.240]
Who can't figure out the fifty cents on a toll road

[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.500]
Why do we have other than the fact that we've got lots and lots of assholes in this town

[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.220]
Who don't belong on a road in the first place

[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.840]
But that aside

[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.060]
Why do we have all this massive traffic jam up because instead of 25 cents

[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.080]
It's 50 cents

[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.160]
You've had to have been in a cocoon the last several days not to know by now

[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.100]
It's 50 cents on those expressways

[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.460]
How could you not know it

[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.740]
75 cents on the turnpike

[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.720]
Are people doing cartwheels on the turnpike

[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.880]
No

[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.720]
Is traffic backed up miles on the turnpike unless there's a wreck

[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.200]
No

[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.800]
Spin that way for a long time

[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.920]
Spin 75 cents back in those days when Chuck Meyer was having people mark out the thing on a quarter there

[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.920]
And Rick and Suds were going

[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.780]
You had a good idea

[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.840]
Remember those great days

[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.940]
On I

[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.480]
O

[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.880]
D

[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.940]
Well that's a long time

[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.320]
That's several years that it's been the 75 cents

[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.380]
And the world didn't come to an end

[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.180]
But for some strange reason

[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.040]
You people are driving dates

[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.560]
And it's not like there wasn't a toilet in the first place you follow what I'm saying

[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.940]
It's not like all of a sudden you woke up yesterday morning and there were toll booths in places where there wasn't one before

[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.220]
There are no new toll booths in Dade County

[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.420]
There's only a chain sparing yet you're getting sucked you're like

[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.340]
Participant in this fraud that's going on now

[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.520]
Your co-conspirators you're part of the goddamn problem

[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.980]
Because you're so goddamn stupid you can't figure out okay, it's 50 cents

[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.520]
I'll either have a couple of quarters or maybe I'll just have a dollar bill out and go through or maybe even better than that

[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.420]
I'll have to get one of those sun past things and go flying through there

[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.620]
This isn't like the end of the world but now comes the mayor penis yesterday

[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.040]
I mean this thing it's like a script of a Broadway play of a motion picture

[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.340]
It's all been written out it's all been a plan from the beginning

[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.840]
And he releases this statement what's happening today is just the forecast of things to come

[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.800]
Says mayor penis

[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.260]
About how the Miami-Dade Expressway Authority MDX

[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:45.280]
How this increases just the start and whether if we don't get that penny sales tax passed on July 29th

[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.120]
There's going to be 11 new toll plases

[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.300]
There'll be a toll plant on every goddamn street quarter in Dade County

[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.340]
And if we don't get that penny sales tax the tolls are going up to 75 cents in 2001

[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.420]
And Yadi yadi yadi yadi et cetera and so on

[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:08.760]
And the MDX plan also calls for the tolling of future value pricing lanes and high occupancy tool lanes along proposed expressway extensions

[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.520]
But the mayor promises and we know how good his word is

[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.680]
It's like he promised to oppose that arena with Mickey Ererson down there downtown for blocks from the older arena

[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:24.240]
He says I will not support tolling on future of value pricing lanes or high occupancy tooling along proposed expressway extensions

[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.900]
if you pass my penny sales tax.

[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.540]
But you'll have to take him at his word, okay?

[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.600]
Because we know that when Mayor Pena speaks,

[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.340]
you can believe it for about a half a second.

[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.520]
And he says with our inaction,

[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.300]
and the construction of new tools,

[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.600]
the complete clogging of vital streets in our community

[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.220]
will be an everyday occurrence.

[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.360]
So not that he's going to threaten you,

[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.620]
and that that they put the new toll in just in time to whip up

[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.680]
all this hysteria a couple of weeks before the goddamn election.

[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.520]
When everybody's out of town.

[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.520]
How come our newspapers,

[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.900]
how come somebody in this town somewhere in the news media

[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.400]
isn't psychotic about this,

[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.100]
doing cartwheels and summer salts?

[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.160]
It's as transparent as looking through a goddamn pane of glass

[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.480]
with a glass bin knocked out.

[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.420]
It's a pain alright, it's a pain in the glass.

[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.440]
Crazy people.

[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.480]
And of course you can do it here,

[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.480]
because like I've said before,

[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.680]
there's no passion about anything here.

[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.200]
Oh yeah, whatever you want, okay?

[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.860]
Just take it, just let me drive, okay?

[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:28.660]
Whatever you want.

[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.860]
Just rake me, screw me, stick it to me.

[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:31.980]
I don't care, I love it.

[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.060]
Just...

[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.360]
Right.

[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.540]
Boy, it's just, it's amazing.

[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.920]
And that's why we have thousands of people

[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.900]
that you're up for those ball games,

[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.080]
because they have no life.

[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.960]
It's going to really stink, we suck,

[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.820]
it's going to be bad,

[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:47.640]
it's going to be hot,

[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.420]
it's going to be uncomfortable.

[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.840]
Hey, where do we get in?

[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.620]
How much you want?

[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.900]
How much for that crackerjack?

[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:56.620]
Oh.

[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.800]
In fact, you know something,

[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.960]
I think I have figured out why

[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.480]
McDonald's is doing such a big business.

[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.780]
I think I just put my finger on it,

[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.840]
and the answer to...

[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.840]
10 past 10 at 5.60 WQAM,

[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.200]
you're, we tell it too much like it is

[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.600]
for everybody's own sanity station.

[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.100]
You hit my rear end.

[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.360]
Maiden

[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.240]
He's amazing,

[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.600]
when I shout my teeth.

[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.780]
Are you all coming?

[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.820]
Slack then switch.

[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.220]
We have Nou ambush.

[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:36.980]
Eh!

[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.360]
I couldn't find.

[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.920]
It very thing I still shouldn't

[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.900]
with that jackalai!

[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:49.420]
our

[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:49.960]
agencies

[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.900]
justice

[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.080]
right

[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:57.520]
Lucy!

[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.360]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, babytwo...

[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:06.620]
inta!

[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.340]
Yeah!

[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.980]
Nothing goes down like I don't like ни, s macchera, but we do talk thing,

[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.300]
what it ground!

[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:16.920]
What g

[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.740]
detail comes when your one ain't judges any dishwasher than your mouth?

[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.560]
It's very easy on the dish kitchen.

[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.900]
and it comes out smooth like metabuses.

[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.900]
It's comfortable in this huge house.

[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:29.720]
Down.

[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.200]
Down shook it through nights in my mouth,

[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.220]
and it's made for my diabetes.

[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.580]
Now it's gonna show up at Tophead.

[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.780]
It's the fastest life, Libby.

[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.140]
On the day the end of the night.

[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.420]
The end of the day the end of the night.

[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.020]
Yeah, the muffin man, he's out of business.

[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.540]
What timing, nice going, Ed Brown.

[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.720]
Muffin man closes up shop right in the Ascent

[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.880]
of this morning, sugar-free treats not as labeled,

[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.380]
eatery owner faces suit filed by customer.

[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.220]
We'll get into that in a minute.

[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.040]
But getting back to this thing.

[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.540]
Take a look at the board right now, okay?

[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.820]
Not one single call on there, okay?

[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.300]
Except that pain in the ass-dave slater,

[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.980]
which we appreciate all your good work day

[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.860]
because you enrich your treatment

[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.340]
on the only ones that care beside me.

[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.620]
But I don't really care that much

[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.620]
because that'll live in Dave County.

[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.220]
And especially if these things go through,

[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.740]
I don't plan on driving them anymore

[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:11.520]
than I have to anyway.

[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.660]
I mean wait till you take a look at the Westbound Duff

[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.060]
and then the Eastbound, this one and the Shula

[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.560]
and the State Road 12,

[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.960]
where we already took the one booth down,

[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.760]
all over the goddamn place, every five blocks

[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.700]
there being another tool booth,

[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.640]
another 11 more reasons why you shouldn't go to Dave County.

[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.360]
And you people in Dave County, by the way,

[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.560]
who've already a lot of bunch of banana boat people

[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.660]
that take over your whole county

[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.660]
and to run the government and turn it into the ground,

[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.300]
turn it into a piece of crap.

[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.160]
You're the ones who are responsible

[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.260]
because every time they say,

[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.920]
you roll over, you do it like an obedient dog.

[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.720]
Just like you're gonna do until I 29th

[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.340]
in the middle of this bogus fixed election.

[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.000]
They are tying up there, they're creating

[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.480]
by intent to read this thing.

[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.700]
Here's somebody who faxes me this brochure

[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.200]
that's being handed out by the MDX.

[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.500]
You see, Mayor Penis makes it sound like somehow

[00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.940]
the Miami Data Expressway Authority

[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.620]
has got nothing to do with him in the county.

[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.880]
Like it's some kind of autonomous thing

[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.160]
like they're not in bed together.

[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.360]
And yet they're released from the Miami Data Expressway

[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.480]
authorities talking about the toll increase

[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.820]
and we can't waste any more time

[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.860]
and we gotta raise the money

[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.200]
because we got gridlock, et cetera.

[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.440]
So it says tolls are the only funding source

[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.400]
MDX is authorized to use under its charter

[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.600]
and toll increases are needed by July,

[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.860]
11th in order to avoid serious delay

[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.420]
in this important rebuilding program.

[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.620]
Does anybody believe that?

[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.600]
By July 11th, not by July 30th

[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.780]
like today after the election, but by July 11th.

[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.180]
It was like it was life and death

[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.840]
that they had to get this toll increase in there

[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.060]
by a couple of days ago in order to make sure

[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.400]
that they had two solid weeks to get everybody crazy

[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.240]
so they would vote yes on that penny sale tax.

[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.160]
And they still don't give a crap.

[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.220]
That's the best part.

[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.520]
They couldn't care less.

[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.860]
And of course you people who are in business

[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.020]
in Dave County, you know that anybody with a brain

[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.180]
it looks like from several days in North Broward

[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.800]
or to South Broward, they're not gonna shop in Dave County

[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.660]
to pay an extra one and a half percent sales tax.

[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.540]
They're not gonna do it.

[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.420]
But don't confuse the public with the facts

[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.600]
because they've already gotten together behind closed doors.

[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.220]
They made up their mind as to what it's gonna be

[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.220]
and nobody cares.

[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.520]
I'm not, you know something I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.

[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.380]
I've already done my thing.

[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.640]
I got all whipped up to a friend's.

[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.080]
He I don't even live in for a con Dave County

[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.720]
and here's another great reason why.

[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.520]
You know the girl I called yesterday was talking about

[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.100]
if I caught up with guiding light, you know

[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.920]
did I keep while I was on vacation and I said no

[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.660]
and so she says oh there'll be no problem

[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.460]
and you go home today, turn it on,

[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.320]
you didn't miss much, you'll catch right up with it.

[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.540]
Well I went home yesterday, three o'clock turned on CBS

[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.980]
which I can only get channel four.

[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.060]
I can't get it on the big dish

[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.980]
because the local affiliates don't want you to be able

[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.720]
to get the out of town network affiliates.

[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.260]
And again, what are they doing?

[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.520]
What the goddamn Cubans out there in the water

[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:51.100]
in the Coast Guard 25 frickin minutes of the same bull crap?

[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.040]
Just like before I went away on vacation,

[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.340]
the same repetitious crap.

[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.280]
Do I care about Cubans out there in a goddamn?

[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.420]
Do I care about that?

[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:01.600]
No.

[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.020]
Most of the people in this audience

[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.260]
give a flying crap about this?

[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:04.480]
No.

[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.920]
But the media here, this is a place even more than anywhere else

[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.360]
in this very tightly controlled country.

[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.180]
This place here in South Florida

[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.040]
where the people are brainwashed and manipulated

[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.400]
by the median of politicians to such a degree

[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.340]
that it's hopeless.

[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.060]
It's hopeless baby, you ain't got a prayer.

[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.520]
Just come here and do like the old, the old fart still.

[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.240]
It's the kind of retire from life.

[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.160]
Don't just retire from work, retire from life.

[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.880]
Maybe they got it right, you know?

[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.040]
Maybe they really have it down to a science.

[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.760]
Just living their own little conclaves

[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.560]
and worry about their own little selfish things

[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.940]
and their early bird dinners

[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.380]
and what's in it for me

[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.740]
and where is my social security?

[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:48.760]
And that's it.

[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.320]
And just escape from all the rest of it

[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.580]
because it's hopeless anyway.

[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.860]
The horse is out of the barn.

[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.140]
And to watch these people in the behavior like I did,

[00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.520]
Sunday come home from the airport

[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.180]
and see them because there's, you know,

[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.060]
so it's said it's $0.25, that's $0.50.

[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.680]
Okay, that was a surprise to me.

[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:05.420]
But guess what?

[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.620]
It wasn't like the end of the world.

[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.840]
Because if you're driving around out there

[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.180]
and you don't have the extra $0.25,

[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.180]
you shouldn't be driving in the first place.

[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.620]
And yet to watch the way you people are carrying on

[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.600]
and like all these lines in this guy this morning is BMW.

[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.260]
Oh Jesus, I don't care.

[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.260]
I make a $0.3.00.

[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.560]
I don't care what kind of sales tax you put it.

[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.060]
Just to stop with this insanity.

[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.900]
Let me say it again.

[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.180]
There was a toll booth.

[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:34.980]
They're already.

[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.940]
They just increased the toll.

[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.240]
Everybody with a brain.

[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.680]
Everybody with even a little teeny tiny one

[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.840]
and a brain too should understand that by now.

[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.260]
And yet they're like doing car wheels out there

[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.220]
in a road and they're switching one lane to another

[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.720]
and oh, what do I do and where do I go and the.

[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.640]
Just exactly as they knew you were gonna do.

[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.620]
I mean, you talk about obedient.

[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.500]
You talk about go stepping it aligned.

[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.460]
Nice going.

[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.280]
I'm sure that Mayor Penis is probably stroking himself

[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:07.760]
right now.

[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.140]
He's so excited about it.

[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.480]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:13.780]
Hello.

[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.260]
Oh, guess what the phone don't work.

[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.600]
Well, how do you like that?

[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.800]
The phone don't work.

[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.300]
We're gonna have to reboot the phone system

[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.500]
and start all over again because this is WQA

[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.140]
and we're here we go.

[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.900]
Buh, buh, buh.

[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:27.020]
You.

[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.400]
Reboot in the phone system.

[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.000]
Stand by.

[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.280]
Okay, you'll have to call back in.

[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.920]
I guess if you run hold all three of you.

[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.600]
5 6 7 0 5 6 8.

[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.220]
Palm 5 6 the on the mobile one line.

[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.840]
Oh, could yourself worked up into a state.

[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.020]
Okay, you're feeling real good.

[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:42.960]
You had a great vacation.

[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.840]
You got some vinegar and whatever.

[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.020]
A little bit of energy.

[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.500]
Speaking of that, by the way, Hank bunched a lot

[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.260]
to Zassen Vegas when he was on vacation.

[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.240]
I was, he was on vacation the same time as I was

[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.560]
and I heard the first part of Hank show yesterday and boy.

[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.800]
Sounded like he must have had a really rough time out there

[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.120]
because usually you come back from vacation

[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.420]
you loaded with energy and you're, thank you so much.

[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.540]
5 6 7 0 that was that was Mayor penis.

[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.240]
Thank you mayor.

[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.380]
Back to you.

[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.480]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.580]
Palm 5 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.120]
Here's the mobile in Davie.

[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:11.380]
Hello.

[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.280]
More near the morning.

[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:13.740]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.020]
The only thing I had to say about that toll thing.

[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.380]
I think I'm just gonna pull my car up and threaten

[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.260]
to doubt if my car was got some lane.

[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.220]
Maybe that'll get Mayor penis's attention.

[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.620]
I doubt it.

[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.900]
And I'll matter material.

[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:27.580]
Okay, great.

[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.540]
He's not a material.

[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.300]
Okay, nobody here cares anything to say about this.

[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:36.240]
I mean, I realized that I'm surrounded by a lot of dumb people

[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.060]
out there in this town.

[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.120]
But Jesus Christ, how is it possible to be this indifferent?

[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.700]
How is it possible?

[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.740]
Whatever you want.

[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.700]
Okay, whatever you want will go along with it.

[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.780]
Just please, just like Howard Beel said,

[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.440]
when you're goddamn steel-belded radios in your pop up poster

[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.240]
and your colored TV and that's it.

[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.940]
Just leave us alone.

[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:56.980]
We don't care what you do.

[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.320]
This is a place where they could come and knock on your door

[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.760]
and pee on your front lawn and take a dump on your porch

[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.560]
and you still, the people, there's still

[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.840]
what I'm not gonna say about it.

[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.600]
Like, I don't like the first guy that was going

[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.340]
to move him like that.

[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.240]
He was, that was the most accurate call of all right there.

[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.220]
I think as of today, I think I should do myself

[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.280]
a tremendous service and promise never ever

[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.620]
to even get involved in any of these things again.

[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.660]
Whether it's Cubans carrying on a block in the highways

[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.160]
or it's corrupt politicians sticking their hand

[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.840]
in your pocket again and screwing you into back.

[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.260]
Well, what there is to make?

[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.460]
It's not gonna change my life.

[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.220]
What, why the hell should I care when I'm living

[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.500]
when they're air four million people?

[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.180]
They don't give a crap about any of this stuff.

[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:44.880]
About anything.

[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:46.460]
Nothing.

[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.140]
Let me just go to that restaurant where the food isn't so good

[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.280]
and where they tell me it's overpriced.

[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.540]
Let me go and check that out.

[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.040]
And then after that, I'll go see a ball game.

[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.740]
I'll go subsidize John Henry or some other billionaire

[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:00.620]
help him out.

[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.460]
So I'm totally changing this thing with a stadium,

[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.320]
they'll get a stadium.

[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.200]
Wherever he wants to build it, they'll get a stadium.

[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.500]
They'll find a way, they'll push it through the rig,

[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.680]
just like they're doing with this thing with the sales tax.

[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:13.420]
They'll do it.

[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.720]
They'll do whatever they want.

[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.020]
It's always been that way here.

[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.200]
Because you people are oblivious and then of course

[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.540]
we got a handful bet bet bet bet.

[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.640]
You know, and they don't do anything.

[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.760]
Here's a mobile in the world, in the Grove.

[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.080]
Hello.

[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.060]
Hey Neil.

[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:27.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.880]
You got to keep it up.

[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:29.580]
You know why?

[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:30.300]
You got to keep it up.

[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.140]
Talking to myself.

[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.420]
No, but you got to keep it up because one day it'll do you

[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:34.740]
with it.

[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.600]
They shut my business down from one day to the next here

[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.540]
and my Cuba County or Miami State County or whatever you

[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:41.320]
want to call it.

[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.340]
You know, the truth is that if property taxes and that

[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.880]
sales tax thing goes through and the property tax increase,

[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.420]
you know, Mayor.

[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:48.580]
OK, great.

[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.400]
56070560.560 on the mobile.

[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.400]
Well, he said at the bull chit is what he said.

[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:54.880]
He's right.

[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:56.640]
It's a lot of chit.

[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.520]
That's what life in deep county is.

[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:00.520]
It's a pilot chit.

[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.220]
56070560.560 on the mobile one line.

[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.780]
Boy, it's amazing to me.

[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.120]
I know.

[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.560]
It's just I.

[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:10.460]
I.

[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:12.640]
Exactly.

[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.100]
Here's a mobile implantation.

[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:17.360]
Hello.

[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:20.600]
Hello.

[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.400]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:22.540]
Yeah.

[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.320]
Yes.

[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.660]
I got two things to say to you.

[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.220]
Number one, you show fantastic.

[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.060]
Listen to you every day.

[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:28.620]
Uh-huh.

[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:34.440]
And number two, 595, which found its close is the broir looking

[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.160]
in just bought the 441 overpass on which bound to the south

[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.780]
in northbound 441.

[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.240]
Yeah.

[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.300]
A little bit of information for you.

[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.580]
OK, thanks for the good news.

[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.540]
Jump now, honey.

[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.360]
And get it over with.

[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.480]
OK, jump now.

[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.520]
And get it over with so we can get traffic moving again.

[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.240]
God damn it.

[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.200]
We got enough problems with traffic all over town.

[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.720]
And she's holding traffic up because she's got some bug

[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.260]
upper ass.

[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:55.920]
Jump now.

[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.120]
And let's get it over with sweetheart.

[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.240]
I'm not going to be one of those people gets on here and tries to

[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.900]
like, you know, detour somebody from doing it.

[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.140]
Jump now and the quits screw it up the traffic.

[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:05.320]
Man.

[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.260]
Boy, cheer is great to be back in town.

[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:09.920]
Yeah.

[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.500]
Why the hell would anybody want to be in all those other places that I go?

[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:13.780]
You know?

[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.500]
When you can be here, having such a neat time.

[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.100]
I'm going on with Dayton Broward.

[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.540]
No more mocking, baby.

[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.340]
I just took the card of the world.

[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.760]
She drives my door against these three feet tall.

[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.360]
I wouldn't ride with her.

[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.040]
No way.

[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.480]
I said I needed their lady today.

[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.340]
So I'm just sitting on a bench in the rain.

[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.720]
Waiting for the honeyfester to take me away.

[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:54.440]
Oh.

[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:58.360]
I'm just sitting on a bench in the rain.

[00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:58.900]
Yeah.

[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.160]
It's my thing.

[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:10.020]
I'm just sitting on a bench in the rain.

[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.040]
The first to bust in is going to always be the same.

[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.260]
I'm not going to do what Dad tells me to do.

[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.720]
The time at high rates, he must be in pain.

[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.420]
Just sitting in, resting my bones.

[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.380]
When you're in, why my wife won't leave me alone?

[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.920]
We've got it over and I never win.

[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.340]
I just wind up treading through the mall again.

[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.920]
Oh, so I sit on the bench in the rain.

[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.260]
Waiting for the honeyfester to take me away.

[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.180]
Oh, you're just sitting on a bench in the rain.

[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.860]
It's my thing.

[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.400]
It's my thing.

[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.380]
And there he is.

[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.100]
That's the end time.

[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:01.780]
That's where you'll be in pain.

[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:02.940]
It's my thing.

[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:03.880]
And if you're in pain.

[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.320]
And if you're going, I'm just sitting on a bench in the rain.

[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.620]
This guy that ran gilders, there were cellamines muffin.

[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.280]
Like a lot of other places do, by the way.

[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:20.760]
Sugar free, fat free, etc.

[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.220]
And so on.

[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.660]
And you check on the ingredients and whatever they bake them

[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:23.900]
with you.

[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:24.460]
Find out.

[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.320]
Surprise.

[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:26.960]
Not sugar free.

[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.600]
In fact, they were using what is this stuff that they were using?

[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:31.420]
Scoop and bake.

[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:32.720]
Scoop and poop.

[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.120]
They were using to make it.

[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.420]
And Abe Bond, 85, who suffers from diabetes,

[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.200]
is suing a restaurant.

[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.640]
It's on us for more than $15,000, claiming to have consumed large quantities of the offending

[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:48.260]
muffins since 1994 as a result, suffering disability across the medical and nursing care.

[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.640]
Because it was he needed too many of these goddamn muffins loaded with sugar.

[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.760]
No more gilders in Delray Beach.

[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:00.880]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on a mobile one line.

[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.940]
Here in the land where they just absolutely refuse to care.

[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.740]
Same crap yesterday, 25 minutes on Channel 4 on the CBS affiliate watching Cubans

[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.440]
out there in a goddamn ocean with the pochking around, screw it around with the coast guard.

[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:15.680]
Hi, Alia.

[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:15.960]
Hello.

[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:17.560]
Neil.

[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.100]
Yes, sir.

[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.420]
You are absolutely correct, sir, on this sales tax pay.

[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:23.680]
And...

[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.500]
And keep hammering it.

[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.040]
No, no, what do you mean keep hammering it?

[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.100]
I can't get a response.

[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.620]
Nobody cares about this thing.

[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.440]
Keep hammering my ass, okay?

[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.860]
Keep hammering it.

[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.480]
Call the hammer and tell him to hammer it, okay?

[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.380]
Keep it going, wait, keep it going.

[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.340]
That was funny.

[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:39.740]
God.

[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:41.720]
What?

[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.160]
I told you he must have had a bad time in Vegas.

[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:46.220]
What?

[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.500]
He never woke up once during that show yesterday.

[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:50.840]
He was out there at Shulas.

[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.820]
He wasn't close by here where they can easily poke him into ribs.

[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.400]
He just must have had a rough time, I guess.

[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.200]
Sounded like it.

[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.340]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on a mobile one.

[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.720]
Yeah, keep hammering away for us.

[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.400]
We have nothing to say about it.

[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:03.560]
We got no opinion.

[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.560]
We don't really care.

[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.320]
But keep wasting your time and your energy.

[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.680]
Be in the spokesman, okay?

[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.240]
I'm tired of being the spokesman.

[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.760]
Winner's no response, all right?

[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.560]
Like farting into a windstorm, into a goddamn tunnel.

[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.240]
What's the point?

[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.160]
You don't even get an echo.

[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.800]
Here's a mobile in the grove.

[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:19.980]
Hello?

[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.380]
First, I work in retail, high price picket items.

[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:24.860]
Yes sir.

[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.940]
The sales tax is going to hurt me.

[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:27.280]
Right.

[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.880]
I mean, it's going to cut into my pocket.

[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.180]
And I don't think that's necessary.

[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.400]
Second point is I just got back from a three week vacation

[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.840]
up because some family's house in Tennessee

[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.580]
to do some horseback riding.

[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:41.900]
I drove to Atlanta.

[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.120]
I didn't go through one single toll road.

[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.040]
I drove through Charlotte, North Carolina.

[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.640]
I drove all these roads.

[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.280]
Not a single toll road.

[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.960]
You could grab through Michigan.

[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.000]
It's got the best expressway system in America.

[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.880]
And you won't find one single toll road either,

[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.720]
until you get to the Ambassador Bridge.

[00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.440]
I mean, this is ridiculous.

[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:04.120]
You can't go 15 miles here without spending $15.

[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.240]
I mean, I traveled everywhere,

[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.020]
and not a single road had to be paid for by toll.

[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.080]
Isn't it interesting, though,

[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.020]
that we can come up with all these creative ways

[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:16.180]
to finance stadiums and arenas for billionaires?

[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.720]
We can do that with taxes on tourists and so on.

[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.660]
No problem at all.

[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.340]
We can come up with the money to build a Wayne High Pingo,

[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.160]
$200 million dollar arena there in sunrise.

[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.360]
But when it comes to coming up with the money to build the roads,

[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.140]
we have to tax the poor bastards here, who, you know,

[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.740]
and again, how about the people that don't even use the roads?

[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.640]
Who are going to have to pay the increased sales tax?

[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.440]
Exactly.

[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.960]
And like I said, the sales tax is going to hurt.

[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.240]
Where are all these people in retail?

[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.200]
They don't think this is going to hurt them.

[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.600]
When you sell big ticket items,

[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.520]
and if you sell big ticket items,

[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.480]
that one cent adds up a lot.

[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.620]
And you know how many snores we got down here,

[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.860]
even if it doesn't add up a lot.

[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.540]
People will spend $3 in gas just to go and buy it for like,

[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.620]
you know, $1 cheaper in Broward County.

[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.480]
Well, like I say,

[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.320]
some people kind of wake up and start thinking using their brains.

[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.220]
Okay, good luck, Pat.

[00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:00.960]
Have a good day.

[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:01.320]
Bye.

[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.220]
Yeah, this MDX piece of propaganda they're handing out

[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.800]
from the expressway authority says,

[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.300]
you know, you do have a choice.

[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.640]
MDX wants you to know that there may be an alternative

[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.800]
for the new MDK tools.

[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.900]
On June 22nd, the Miami-Dade County Commission approved Mayor

[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.980]
Pienes' proposal for a countywide referendum

[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.820]
for Thursday, July 29th.

[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.600]
And if you will go ahead and vote for that thing,

[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.680]
we'll abolish all these tools,

[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:22.920]
and the world will not come to an end,

[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.720]
and the sky will not fall, etc., and so on.

[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.880]
So here, you know, the Mayor wants to give the impression

[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.560]
like the MDX is some kind of self-propelled authority

[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.760]
that he's got no control over,

[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.520]
we're not involved with.

[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.680]
And yet, this is a campaign that the two of them are running together.

[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.180]
It's a blackmail campaign.

[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:41.300]
They're threatening you.

[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.600]
If you don't like what it is now,

[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:43.740]
just wait, baby.

[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.940]
We'll have a tool on every goddamn street corner.

[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.140]
We'll build another goddamn tool booth in the store your life.

[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.780]
If you won't let loose and give us that penny sales tax,

[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.540]
so we can do whatever the hell we want with it.

[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.620]
And we can do the same kind of fraud that Mirat Steerheim

[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.480]
supervised over here with the first batch

[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.220]
of a reelection 20 years ago in that fraud.

[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.800]
And I'm the only goddamn person in the media in this town

[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.480]
that's sitting here spewing my guts out,

[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.760]
and like I said, I don't know why.

[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.160]
Didn't do any good back then.

[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.460]
It won't do any good now.

[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.880]
Because I see these jerkballs, these assholes,

[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.000]
these Johnny Jerkoffs this morning sitting there,

[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.780]
carrying on like the world is coming to an end,

[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.020]
because they can't figure out how to pay the 50 cent tool.

[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:22.060]
Yeah.

[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:23.620]
How do you do that?

[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.220]
I guess somebody better show them how to feel the change.

[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.180]
Here's a mobile in the West Palm Beach.

[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.980]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:32.500]
Okay, sir.

[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.100]
I got a question on the satellite dish

[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.880]
where they're taking away the network feed.

[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:37.200]
Yes.

[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.020]
They say you got to get the local stations and all,

[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.840]
and that's fine except I got to pick it.

[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.540]
Oh, it's not fine.

[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.680]
Well, you're right.

[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.700]
I got a big screen TV and the local feed suck.

[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:48.120]

[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.780]
So now I'm losing this stuff and they say,

[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.360]
I don't understand how the newspapers get around it.

[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.160]
If there's a local...

[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.240]
Because the newspapers aren't regulated by any government agency,

[00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.620]
the newspapers don't have an FCC,

[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.500]
the newspapers do whatever they want.

[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:01.760]
Exactly.

[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:02.500]
You're right.

[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.080]
They do exactly what they want.

[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.040]
But it's the same kind of, you know,

[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.080]
one's a print medium, the other one's electronic,

[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.740]
but it's information entertainment and advertisement.

[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:15.140]
So if I get the Palm Beach Post or the Sun Sentinel locally,

[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.740]
how can I also get the New York Times as a Chicago Tribune

[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.240]
or one of those?

[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:19.920]
Sure, let me...

[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.180]
What are...

[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.240]
And I just get you're saying to you,

[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.680]
the print media have no government regulating agency.

[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.820]
There's nobody to tell them where they can distribute

[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.640]
or what they can do because it's called freedom.

[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.020]
You have the freedom to buy any publication you want,

[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.440]
just like you should have the freedom to watch anything

[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.100]
over the year that you want, especially if you're willing

[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.480]
to pay for it, like the network of polyaturmata town.

[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.780]
But instead, what we have is on the 30th of June,

[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:40.940]
we had them all removed from our big satellite dishes.

[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.300]
And we're forth to watch local affiliates, which, as you say,

[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.740]
you have a very grainy subpar picture in many cases

[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.680]
and, in addition to which, they just pick and choose

[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.540]
when they're going to pre-empt the network programming

[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.460]
for like long chunks of period at a time.

[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.720]
Like whenever there's a goddamn Cuban with it between here

[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.520]
and the 90 miles to Cuba in the water,

[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.200]
we're going to have to go away for half an hour.

[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.300]
Exactly. And that sucks.

[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.720]
You're damn right, it sucks.

[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.200]
And, you know, I...

[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:04.420]
I set one...

[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.740]
Hey, or nearly up until June 30th,

[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.780]
if I'd gotten home yesterday

[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.420]
and had that crap on Channel 4,

[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.680]
I would have just turned over to WSE,

[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.080]
either on the satellite,

[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.260]
and then watched it on the big nation,

[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.300]
said, Screw Channel 4.

[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.580]
I don't give a crap about any more of this banana boat crap.

[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.580]
Exactly. Or if you have a life and you're out doing something,

[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.900]
then you miss something you want to watch it, you know,

[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.340]
eight o'clock, you have to pick it up at 11 on the west coast.

[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.300]
Right. That's right.

[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.300]
And now you're screwed because you have the right...

[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.400]
And I agree, you should have the right to buy any newspaper you want.

[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.900]
And you should have the right to pick up any TV program.

[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:35.540]
And that's right.

[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.720]
You're damn right.

[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.640]
I don't know what else to do.

[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.260]
I sent the letters to Congress.

[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.760]
Well, I've been in your wheels, man.

[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:42.540]
Welcome to America,

[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.900]
where we never met in the NAPOLE we didn't like.

[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.960]
Better just grab our damn passport.

[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.000]
Okay, pal. Good luck.

[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:48.780]
Thanks, buddy.

[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.720]
Oh, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.440]
Do they care?

[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:53.800]
No.

[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.760]
Are they ever going to care?

[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.740]
Are they going to get motivated?

[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:56.800]
Are they going to get pissed off?

[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:56.980]
No.

[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.040]
Are they not worked out?

[00:31:59.000 --> 00:31:59.040]
No.

[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:00.240]
No.

[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.760]
See, whenever the Cuban's blocking roads

[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:05.660]
here a couple of weeks ago,

[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.780]
then everybody was psychotic.

[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.020]
And they, well, should have been,

[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.300]
then they were forming at the mouth.

[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.200]
Because that involved the usual old ethnic psychosis.

[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.100]
But here we got the roads all blocked off,

[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.260]
and everybody's having a nervous breakdown,

[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.440]
because you've got a political scam being pulled off right in front of your eyes,

[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.080]
and nobody gives a crap.

[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.840]
Nobody's got anything to say about it.

[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.440]
Back then, they sure had planned to say about it.

[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:31.920]
We could have done like a five-week seminar on psychosis back when the Cubans

[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.880]
were blocking off the roads,

[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.620]
because they didn't get their way just the way they wanted it with a goddamn Coast Guard.

[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.820]
You people, I'm telling you right now,

[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.520]
you've got nobody to blame but yourself.

[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.600]
Those of you in Dave County,

[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.220]
you've got nobody to blame.

[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:50.060]
Because you've sat back, you've allowed a segment of the community to run a whole goddamn thing,

[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.040]
and you just walk around in La La.

[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:53.720]
That's your thing.

[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:55.740]
It's a toilet.

[00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:58.900]
Hi, Neil.

[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.040]
This is Sunny with the Word of the Day.

[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.760]
We're here for a good time.

[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:03.860]
Not a long time.

[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.260]
Yeah, especially in your case.

[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.080]
Oh, God, Neil.

[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.180]
Me, this is Standbyenstein for Sofaking.

[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:09.620]
You understand?

[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.760]
Where everything is held to the high, sofaking standards.

[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.420]
The selection isn't just huge, it's sofaking huge.

[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:17.740]
Believe me, you'll never shop anywhere else.

[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.020]
And Sofaking's price is not just low, they're sofaking low.

[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.840]
You'll never find them anywhere else.

[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.560]
Listen to me.

[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.180]
When I say sofaking as a beautiful store, I mean sofaking beautiful.

[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.240]
When I say staff is helpful, I mean sofaking helpful.

[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.020]
Listen to me.

[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.700]
Get to know the Sofaking and enjoy a selection that's sofaking huge.

[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.660]
A staff that's sofaking courteous and pricey is that a sofaking low,

[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.680]
you'll never shop anywhere else.

[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.920]
But don't take it from me.

[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.940]
Take it from satisfied customer Frank and Stein.

[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.840]
Sofaking good.

[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:49.640]
You said it, Frankie.

[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.560]
Sofaking good.

[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.480]
1046 at 560 WQAM.

[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.260]
We have 62 open lines here.

[00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:58.680]
560 560.

[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.660]
On the mobile one line.

[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.680]
It's the middle of the summertime.

[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.980]
The people would have brand their own account around vacation.

[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.220]
So what am I getting excited about?

[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:06.880]
It's the same old crap you've been doing.

[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.000]
You know, after 23 years you'd like to think that sometimes,

[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.540]
somewhere along the line, maybe you made a little bit of difference.

[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.380]
You said something.

[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.100]
You did something.

[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.140]
Is it possible here?

[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:15.360]
No.

[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:15.640]
No.

[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.100]
So just take the money and keep making a lot of noise.

[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:18.740]
Kill some time.

[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:20.660]
Call him Dale.

[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:20.860]
Hello.

[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:24.280]
And Dale, I really can't come in on the MDX.

[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.980]
I don't go down to Dave County without a police escort.

[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.460]
But there was a human blockade.

[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.080]
They attempted in St. Louis yesterday.

[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:31.420]
I know.

[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.660]
Probably resulted in that asshole that called us from St. Louis yesterday.

[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.200]
Probably protesting his abort behavior.

[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.060]
But the differences there, they arrested 200 demonstrators.

[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.560]
Mostly black, I believe.

[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.360]
Including Reverend Al Sharp too.

[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:43.540]

[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.240]
And you'll never notice the resemblance between Jeff Bush and that.

[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.780]
Okay, 560 705 60, pound 560 on the mobile one line.

[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.380]
Here's Miami.

[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.320]
Hello, I can see this is going to be a short effort today.

[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:54.800]
Miami.

[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:55.660]
A meal.

[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:56.180]
Yes, sir.

[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.480]
Go on, it's Neil.

[00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:58.840]
Yeah.

[00:34:59.380 --> 00:34:59.740]
Yeah.

[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.680]
Meaning what?

[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:01.400]
What?

[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:03.320]
Meaning what?

[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:03.920]
Meaning what?

[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.060]
You got any material?

[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:05.960]
No, you got no material.

[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.900]
You're just another asshole.

[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:08.300]
Okay, get back out of an anavoid.

[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:08.800]
I'll write pal.

[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:09.860]
Well, pack your media notes.

[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.420]
And a Cuban bullet.

[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.300]
560 705 60, pound 560 on the mobile one line.

[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.620]
Here's the mobile in the rail.

[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:18.940]
Hello.

[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.520]
Hey Neil, what's going on?

[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.860]
Not a damn thing pal.

[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.540]
Same old method.

[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:22.780]
Yeah.

[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.680]
Same old death net.

[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:24.660]
You can almost smell it.

[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.760]
Well, I'm pretty pissed off and fired up about this penny tax.

[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.680]
Yeah, well nobody else.

[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.420]
Nobody cares.

[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:34.760]
See, people need to realize it's going to affect every single person in date county, this penny tax.

[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:35.260]
Yeah.

[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:41.340]
If you calculate it, it's a penny per dollar that you waste in everything that you buy.

[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:47.920]
So it's going to cost a lot more to everyone, this penny tax, than the 25 cents extra that you will be paying.

[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:54.980]
Did you see this mayor yesterday on TV with his little chart showing how much the toll is going to raise like by the year 2002.

[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.160]
And in 2010, it will be like, up a dollar.

[00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:01.280]
And in 2020, it's going to be up a...

[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.140]
Yeah, I'm sure everybody here is really concerned about 2020.

[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:05.660]
I'm sure we're worried about that.

[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.880]
Right, the minimum wage will probably be about $15 an hour anyway.

[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:09.200]
Yeah.

[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.400]
But I'm voting no.

[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.760]
My growth is voting no.

[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.140]
First, this is voting no.

[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.340]
Her mother's voting no.

[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.520]
No, no, no.

[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:17.460]
Thank you Neil.

[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.820]
No, no, no.

[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.520]
Vote early and often pal, two 300 times a piece at least.

[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.900]
560, 560, 560 on a mobile one line.

[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:29.760]
Here's a lady mobile in Lauderdale Lakes.

[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:29.960]
Hello.

[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:31.640]
Hello Neil.

[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:32.340]
Yes ma'am.

[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.300]
I just wanted to let you know my family and I had just gotten back from Europe.

[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:46.320]
And it's amazing how in Switzerland, in a city like Basel, people can just hop on and off public transportation.

[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:51.060]
You don't have to wait, not even maybe a minute to.

[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.680]
You can get all over the city.

[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:53.020]
Right.

[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:53.920]
They're wonderful roads.

[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.520]
And I don't see anybody paying tolls about anything.

[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:03.280]
And my husband has practically half his paychecks taken away from the...

[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:07.920]
by the government for supposedly roads, schooling, and all of this business.

[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:13.420]
And yet, when you stop and think about it, what we have the worst school system,

[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.160]
I think we're worth the Mississippi now.

[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.020]
We have horrible roads.

[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.560]
They're constantly patching and unpatching them.

[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.280]
And we have to pay through the nose for them.

[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:28.420]
Now I don't live in day county, but I'm fumed every time I have to go there and stop, you know,

[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:32.680]
every five seconds along the way, to pay to use these substandard roads.

[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.720]
And I think people ought to really think hard where they're not going to.

[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:42.640]
You can sit here and pontificate and say what they ought to do and what they ought to think.

[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.540]
They don't care.

[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.580]
They don't care.

[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.540]
I'm sitting here today doing my usual begging for a phone call routine.

[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.680]
And I would have thought when I sat down here this morning,

[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.480]
I even mentioned this again that the people would have been up at arms.

[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.020]
But they don't care.

[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.920]
All they do, all they want to do is hate each other.

[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.700]
That's all they know about.

[00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:57.980]
So if I can't stop.

[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.900]
If it has an ethnic flavor to it, then they get whipped up into a frenzy about it.

[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.840]
But if it has to do with things that affect all of us, they don't care.

[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.220]
And it's really so ludicrous because when you go to other places,

[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:12.000]
and you see how many people from all over the place live in all these cities,

[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.960]
get along, and really get upset about the things that are common to everybody.

[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.000]
As you say, education.

[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.220]
Well, when I go to your final round, I would never dream of running a car or using a car.

[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.840]
You have every kind of transportation.

[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:26.400]
I know.

[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.000]
You have the trams and buses and subways.

[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:30.820]
It's amazing.

[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:35.420]
But even if you use my husband and I did run a car, it was wonderful.

[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.720]
You drove all over the expressways.

[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:38.960]
Never had a problem.

[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.120]
There were all kinds of gas stations, food where you go,

[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.140]
God forbid, get real food when you pull off on the expressways,

[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:46.360]
instead of plastic stuff.

[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:48.760]
It was amazing.

[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:53.560]
And why is it that we have such a problem down here?

[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.180]
And it wasn't any better before we had all these ethnic.

[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.180]
I mean, it's always been bad.

[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:02.360]
You're building a arena in the stadium, sweetheart.

[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.460]
We don't have money for things like schools and roads.

[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:05.420]
We don't have money for that.

[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:06.440]
I guess not.

[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.820]
We have to keep blackmailing the public and threatening them to get the money.

[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.040]
It almost sounds like...

[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:15.880]
I had the tape to call you because it sounds like, okay, I'm sounding off.

[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.000]
You're sounding off.

[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.580]
And as you say, we just...

[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:20.880]
We're just like, we're in the dark.

[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.140]
We're just whistling in the dark.

[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.180]
These people don't care.

[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.060]
And it's horrible because we unfortunately have to live here.

[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.400]
My husband has business here.

[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.980]
I can't take off and leave.

[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.680]
Well, I live in Broward County.

[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.660]
Other than the Turnpike, I don't pay a toll anywhere.

[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:36.720]
So I'm not worried about it.

[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:40.000]
Some of how it's powered, we manage to survive without all the tolls.

[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.720]
Somehow, let's hope it stays that way.

[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:42.500]
Thanks a lot.

[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:42.800]
Okay.

[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.600]
Five, six, seven, eight, five, 60, pound, five, 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.660]
Just keep blackmailing and threatening and putting these little games together.

[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.140]
And it works.

[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.020]
That's why they do it because it works.

[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.660]
And because every time they do it, the herald joints in there

[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.200]
and the rest of the media sits back like they got the palsy,

[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.200]
like they got the cats got their tongue.

[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:00.880]
And that's it.

[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.400]
And they just go ahead and do whatever the hell they want.

[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.000]
And you people sit back on your ass.

[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:04.880]
Yeah.

[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:05.300]
Yeah.

[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.100]
Yeah.

[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.880]
Oh my God.

[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.940]
I mean, to see that scene with these people with the lines backed up.

[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:12.660]
Oh my God.

[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.300]
50 cents instead of a quarter.

[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.220]
What are we going to do?

[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:16.920]
How the hell are we going to get through this thing here?

[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:17.840]
How does it work?

[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.160]
How can it be done?

[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.400]
Oh, man.

[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.500]
How can they find our service for 23 years?

[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.380]
And I'll keep saying it.

[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:28.740]
Asking the same question.

[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:32.440]
How can they stick so many stupid people in the same place at the same time?

[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.140]
That's the question for the ages.

[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.780]
Man, where did they find them?

[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.820]
They must have had a factory where they stand them all out.

[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.500]
All these people sit in there wondering,

[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.680]
and of course they get right up to the booth.

[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.080]
Naturally, God forbid that you know,

[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.360]
like should a half a mile ahead get your change out

[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.620]
or have some kind of concept.

[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.140]
I mean, it only has big, big green and blue signs up there.

[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.800]
Pull ahead, et cetera, and so on.

[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:54.540]
How much it is?

[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:55.860]
No, no.

[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.300]
Just pull in there and then start to try to finger it out.

[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.620]
Here's a lady in coconut crea.

[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.400]
Hi, I just ended up calling the White House.

[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.000]
You can call the White House anybody can get the phone number

[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:11.240]
from information and explain that we live down here.

[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.220]
And the president I didn't realize was coming.

[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:16.040]
He's not coming because there's a Cuban situation or anything like that.

[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:20.360]
But the bottom line is I would like to see an American flag flowing once in a while down there.

[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.560]
I was thinking the next time they've been...

[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:22.980]
Okay, great.

[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.400]
Everybody call the White House and tell them

[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.500]
we want to see an American flag flowing down there.

[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:29.200]
Okay?

[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.160]
Wherever down there is.

[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:32.520]
Woo!

[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:33.680]
See what I'm saying?

[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.400]
That's what gets them whipped up.

[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.920]
Let's start with the Cubans again.

[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.460]
Let's start with the ethnic business.

[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.500]
Let's start with all that crap all over it.

[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:41.240]
Come on, here we go.

[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:41.720]
That's it.

[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:42.500]
Keep it up.

[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:43.040]
Let's go.

[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:43.380]
That's it.

[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:45.840]
That'll get them worked up.

[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.160]
All the same people like that bitch.

[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.860]
Called the White House to tell them that she'd like to see a Cuban flag stuck down here.

[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.480]
Stick this, honey.

[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.220]
Stick it up.

[00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.900]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.120]
Calm 5, 60 on a mobile one line.

[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.640]
Yeah, send her a limp biscuit, okay?

[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.380]
Tell her to...

[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:06.200]
Stick it up, here we go.

[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:07.280]
Great song, by the way.

[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:08.340]
Not...

[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.360]
Man with a piece of crap.

[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.360]
What a... what garbage.

[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.200]
What's swill?

[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.020]
You show me a white guy trying to do rap.

[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:16.760]
Then I'll show you really, you know, other than Eminem, okay?

[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.740]
I'll make an exception there.

[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.340]
Which we have to...

[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.780]
Every other word that he says anyway.

[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.260]
Because he's a little on the six side.

[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:22.980]
You don't want him to say it?

[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:23.920]
Like my anus.

[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:26.420]
Here's...

[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.480]
No, I don't mean my anus is on the six side, not yet.

[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:29.640]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:29.900]
Hello?

[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:31.420]
Dale.

[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:31.940]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:32.920]
How you doing, man?

[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:33.580]
Great.

[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:39.740]
I live in Miami and the problem with a lot of these elections in Miami is they only let the city of Miami vote on them.

[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.100]
No, this is a countywide...

[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:42.720]
This is a countywide.

[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:42.720]

[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:43.920]
Sure, a county election.

[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:51.160]
Which it should be defeated easily because most people in the county should realize that 25 cents will be much better than another penny sales tax.

[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:58.080]
But most of the Miami issues, it's voted on such a small percentage of the actual...

[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.700]
You know, when you consider Miami, you've got to consider candle and the gables and all the other areas.

[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:04.580]
And they don't get to vote on it.

[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:05.900]
So it really...

[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.180]
What does that have to do with this?

[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.320]
Because I'm really scared again.

[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.400]
It just got to your saying it's a countywide election.

[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:10.840]
Right.

[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:11.080]

[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:12.180]
The countywide...

[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:16.620]
That being held in the middle of the summertime was at least 50% of the people who live in the county are out of town.

[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:20.620]
Well, that's a political thing that they've rigged and of course they're going to try to...

[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:27.840]
You know, which is a joke because the mayor is a joke and he tries to make it seem like his way with the penny tax would be easier.

[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.020]
You know what? It costs $3 to get to Manhattan.

[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.500]
You know, it costs money to drive sometimes and that's all you have to...

[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.180]
You know, 50 cents if you don't have 50 cents to pay for a toll, you shouldn't be driving.

[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.780]
Parking isn't going to get it off the road, that's right.

[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.860]
I mean, you know, it's real simple.

[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:49.240]
But the whole city of Miami, as long as we have the same politicians running the city of Miami, it'll never change.

[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.540]
And, you know, the bigger the city grows with the more people that come into the city, the harder it gets for anything to change.

[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.480]
It doesn't seem like it's going to change anytime soon.

[00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:59.400]
Okay, I'll see you in brown.

[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:00.240]
Yep.

[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:03.740]
56670560, pound 560.

[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:04.520]
I'm so depressed.

[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.240]
I'm so sorry that I came back here.

[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:06.880]
I can't begin.

[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:11.840]
There are no words for me to describe how depressed I am that I came back to this place where the people are sitting.

[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:17.440]
So God, them indifferent, so uninvolved, so asleep, so lethargic, so pathetic.

[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:28.160]
There will be a behavior, this, like I said, these people out there in a row with this, backed up a mile because there's been a 25 cents increase and putting on a show just exactly what the politicians predicted and hoped for and prayed.

[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:33.780]
If they would have written a script, you couldn't have acted out better for them, including that jackass they hit on Channel 4 News this morning.

[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.440]
Sir, I hope they charge you 80% sales tax and everything you buy, okay?

[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:39.960]
Just because you're such a jackass.

[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.560]
Yeah, God don't care what it is.

[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.080]
2% 5% just give me out of this traffic.

[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:51.600]
Woo!

[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:54.120]
Exactly.

[00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:02.340]
For the rating of my 6th meeting, don't you delay any time as a sports lottery day!

[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:08.780]
Now, Dr. Jeremy Burnham with a dramatic reading of no scrubs by TLC.

[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.180]
Dr. Burnham?

[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.820]
A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly, also known as a buster.

[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.940]
Always talking about what he wants just sits in his broke ass.

[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:22.140]
So no, I don't want your number. No, I don't want to give you mine.

[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.360]
And no, I don't want to meet you, nowhere.

[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.960]
No, I don't want none of your time.

[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:28.580]
And no, I don't want no scrub.

[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:31.800]
A scrub is the guy that can't get no love for me.

[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:35.780]
Hang it out the passenger side of his best friend's ride, trying to holla at me.

[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:39.060]
No scrub. No scrub. No no.

[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.920]
No scrub. No no no no no.

[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.700]
No scrub. No no.

[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:45.060]
No.

[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.300]
I can't fucking hit it yet.

[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:49.160]
Level 2 of 5.

[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:50.860]
60 WQAM.

[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.040]
So anyway, here's the facts from Bob Barron.

[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:55.260]
Who the hell is Bob Barron?

[00:45:55.320 --> 00:46:00.040]
That's not the old, the old, oh no, this is a Bob Barron with the Miami Fusion, is that it?

[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:01.880]
Axiol and Newton-Achial.

[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:02.260]
Yeah.

[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:08.860]
And anyway, this guy sends the facts to the first team, complaining bitterly about how they're always bashing soccer.

[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:10.360]
He sends it to our facts machine.

[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:14.440]
So Bob, it's very articulate, you're full of crap though, by the way, because the guys in the morning are right.

[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.880]
Nobody here cares about soccer.

[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:21.440]
Whether it's the fusion or the confusion or the confluence, or whatever it is, the confluence, nobody cares.

[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.020]
So give it a rest, Bob.

[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:27.020]
And next time you want to send a fact to the first team, send it to their facts machine, it'll maybe get to them.

[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:34.340]
Because every time we get a fact that they didn't close to being for the worst team, we tear it up immediately without even reading it because it'll piss off D-Fo and his mother.

[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:35.280]
Oh, sorry Betty.

[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.240]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.800]
Yeah, hey, how you doing?

[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:40.360]
Okay, sir.

[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:48.160]
Yeah, I hope anybody who's before this vote comes up uses their brains and some mathematics and realizes the cars are going to cost you to $300 more.

[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.300]
They're not going to do that.

[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:52.180]
People aren't mathematicians, they're emotional creatures.

[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:59.160]
And what's being done now, this whole scan that's being orchestrated now to work on the emotions and the frustrations of the drivers in the aid county,

[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:04.680]
which is the people who are going to be here in two and a half weeks to vote on this thing, that's what's going to influence them, not dollars and cents.

[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:07.440]
They're not going to sit down with a calculator and forgive these things out.

[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:12.400]
Yeah, because I mean, I chose my work according to where I live to eliminate driving. That's my choice.

[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:17.200]
If they choose to drive it down to Miami, it's going to stop whether there's a toll booth or not.

[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:17.580]
Yeah.

[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:23.720]
But it's going to cost us a restaurant, it's going to cost us a washer dryer, a big screen TV, anything you buy.

[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:27.600]
We're going to be given money out, and if we don't drive it, we're paying for it.

[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:29.540]
Yeah.

[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:33.920]
So I just hope people use their brains, but that's that a lot in this county.

[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:35.060]
Okay, good luck, sir.

[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.540]
Yeah, I'll go on to us all.

[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:43.020]
Yeah, I mean, he starts with a brains business, that's why I still getting really nervous because, I keep wondering what brains he's talking about.

[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:50.480]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, they pound 5, 6, the out of eight TNT wireless line, Hank Goldberg, sure I'm sure Hank will be awake by today.

[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.720]
You know, that first day back from vacation is always tough.

[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.580]
He'll be on here from two to six this afternoon.

[00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:01.060]
6 o'clock, we got Jim Man, and then 7, 45, we got to add all star game, which the 10 people who interested in that will be watching it on TV.

[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:04.820]
But we got it because it killed some really good time and then at Kaplan after the game

[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.380]
I'm sure am I right about that?

[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:11.140]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.120]
Here's the mobile and homestead.

[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:12.360]
Hello?

[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:14.420]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:15.060]
Okay sir.

[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.060]
Never figured you for an M&M fan.

[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:27.680]
Have you heard the new sway and DJ, Keck CD with one new track from M&M and one where

[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.160]
he's doing a bunch of stuff with a bunch of other hip-hop artists?

[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.460]
Yeah, I saw one of the cuts last night on the...

[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:34.140]
The anthem?

[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:35.620]
What was it?

[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.940]
The cut that you saw was called the anthem.

[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:41.840]
There were a ton of people in there that was kind of Chino and a couple of others.

[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:42.600]
That was the one.

[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:48.000]
Oh, it was funny because I went to the M&M show which I didn't see, but there was maybe

[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.300]
like 20 people in the over 21 section over there at the cameos.

[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:51.680]
Yeah.

[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.980]
Because they, you know, of course, they were like alcohol upstairs and it was like, I've

[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:59.460]
watched your 15 year olds and I've looked around and said, I'm getting old but my taste

[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.480]
you're still young, Neil.

[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.300]
You know what I mean?

[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:02.500]
I know what you mean.

[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:03.400]
All right.

[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.320]
Take it easy.

[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.100]
Okay, see ya.

[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:05.600]
What do you say?

[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.480]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:11.560]
I think what he said was that Limpus gets sucks and he's absolutely right.

[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:14.620]
Their album came on in Goalboard by the way, number one before the week.

[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:15.940]
He showed the American music.

[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:16.720]
Oh, God.

[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:21.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:21.940]
Toy Box.

[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.180]
You ever going to hear from them over here?

[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:23.380]
No.

[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:24.460]
I doubt it.

[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:28.440]
Just like when I came back from vacation at other time and played steps, only less and

[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:29.820]
worse record we ever heard in our lives.

[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:30.180]
Okay.

[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.600]
You stick with Jennifer Lopez, okay, and I'll stick with Toy Box.

[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:40.180]
Anybody out there got a toy box?

[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.000]
Dolphins football sports radio.

[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:44.900]

[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:46.380]
Q, A.

[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.580]
Okay, let me lead you in a little bit of a secret.

[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:52.200]
Okay, we already know about the brought on 5, 95 and 4, 41.

[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:52.580]
Okay.

[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:54.120]
No more phone calls about it.

[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.400]
No more facts is about it.

[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:56.660]
We already had it on the air.

[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.380]
We know about it.

[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.540]
There's nothing we can do about it.

[00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:58.820]
Okay.

[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:02.640]
I told her to jump already and get it over with sort of clear the traffic and get you all

[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.240]
going again, but that's the best I can do.

[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.800]
Man, oh man, oh man alive.

[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:08.880]
What a place this is.

[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.160]
It's just staggering.

[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:11.200]
It's just amazing.

[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:17.220]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.200]
I want my salad from Trucks by the way for lunch.

[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:20.440]
I want that real nice salad.

[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:23.500]
He does, you know, with the cool cuts and the cheese and stuff like that soon.

[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:24.740]
Really soon.

[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.840]
I need salad for my brain.

[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.120]
Here's a mobile in Miami lakes.

[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:31.400]
Hello.

[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.360]
Hey, no, yes, sir.

[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:34.080]
I know.

[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:35.820]
He's going to go by this throw off the bridge.

[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:36.660]
It looks nice.

[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.080]
I had dealership and asked him in the sun.

[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.600]
I'm I'm not going to believe this.

[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:45.020]
First of all, nobody speaks English there and they got Santa Claus and Christmas trees

[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:45.660]
and Christmas fights.

[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:46.080]
I'm ready.

[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:48.040]
Yeah, I need to tell those two.

[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.120]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, you see what I'm saying?

[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:52.940]
That's all you people want to talk about.

[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:53.820]
That's all you know.

[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:57.100]
The thing that's got to do with Mayor penis here other than the fact that he's a professional

[00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:59.480]
Cuban, but other than that, this is all a date county.

[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.840]
It's got an ethnic thing.

[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:05.880]
And we get to one broad and they old bitch that's on the phone to the White House.

[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:09.520]
Whereas looking for somebody with an American flag down there.

[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.740]
She don't even live in a date county, but she's got a big mouth worried about what kind

[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:15.020]
of flag they're waving down there.

[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:18.820]
And then we got this guy in here who's going out of his way to go to date county to look

[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:20.140]
out for people who can't speak English.

[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:24.660]
That should be real tough sir looking for people in English and date county.

[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:26.300]
We're getting a search party.

[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:31.320]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:35.580]
The town that doesn't work folks don't let anybody pull the wool over your eyes for

[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:36.400]
even a half a second.

[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.040]
This place doesn't work.

[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:41.040]
Here's Kendall.

[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:41.340]
Hello.

[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:42.680]
Yes, Neil.

[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:43.320]
Yes, sir.

[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:49.720]
So going to shoot down anybody's idea of going up to Broward and avoiding the fail

[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:50.420]
fact they increase.

[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:55.180]
I can tell you because I did this myself when it's about my car because fail fact was

[00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:56.000]
cheaper and Broward.

[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:56.380]
Yes.

[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:01.840]
I was in 92 and they had to charge into the fail facts regardless and send it back to

[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.880]
my two day county.

[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.240]
Well, if you think that you if anybody thinks that they call out.

[00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:10.660]
You mean you live in date county because I've decided in date county.

[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:10.840]
Yeah.

[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:12.700]
They had to charge me the date county.

[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:13.560]
Well, move to Broward.

[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.520]
That's my suggestion sir.

[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.600]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound for all in your case stay in date.

[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:20.560]
I have pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.540]
Here's a mobile implantation.

[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:22.780]
Hello.

[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:24.180]
I know how you doing.

[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:24.740]
Okay, sir.

[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.460]
Yeah, I find out some good work.

[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.200]
So yesterday.

[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:29.140]
No, I did not.

[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:30.020]
Okay.

[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.820]
Most of it's not where you buy it but higher for parents.

[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:35.260]
How are you talking about?

[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.400]
What do you mean by that?

[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:37.760]
How do you click the broadcast?

[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:38.320]
Yeah.

[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:39.740]
How do you click it?

[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.960]
Just like throw it in the grill or what do you do?

[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:43.780]
Oh, how do I cook it on the grill?

[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:44.060]

[00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:46.440]
Okay, before you put it on the grill try this.

[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.020]
There's what we used to do in the Midwest.

[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:52.680]
Take it a big pile of boiling water, put about a half a camera beer in it and some onions.

[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:53.260]
Yeah.

[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:58.400]
And boil all the bratwurst in that beer and water mixture for about 10 minutes.

[00:52:58.700 --> 00:52:58.860]
Yeah.

[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.500]
And then take it out and throw it on the grill.

[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:01.260]
Okay.

[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:02.420]
It'll taste a lot better.

[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:03.540]
But where am I going to find it?

[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:04.780]
Okay, we can find it.

[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.380]
Well, do you want to go and have it and either the restaurant or the very end village

[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:09.880]
at Hollywood?

[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.180]
The Barbarian Village.

[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:11.900]
Uh-huh.

[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.160]
You mean the Barbarian Village?

[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.300]
Barbarian Village.

[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.880]
Do they have a deli?

[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:19.580]
I don't think you've taken out there but you've sit down and eat it.

[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:24.400]
No, no, I don't want to sit down and you want to take it home and make it like on the grill.

[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:29.860]
Well, the best stuff that you can find is Johnsonville bratwurst to the Wind Lakes

[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:30.300]
here of public.

[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.540]
Oh, no, public's just got no bratwurst.

[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.680]
That was in my public's last night.

[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:34.460]
I scoured in there.

[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:35.340]
They don't have any bratwurst.

[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:38.520]
Well, another public's still going down my work.

[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:41.420]
The one down here by work?

[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:42.480]
Well, not here.

[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.420]
I'm here on 441.

[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:44.540]
That's for bed now.

[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:45.100]
Okay.

[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.200]
Thanks for the good news, pal.

[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:47.380]

[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:48.260]
Woo.

[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:50.160]
I know.

[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:50.860]
Excuse me.

[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:51.540]
I get carried away.

[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:52.560]
I was in Cologne, Germany.

[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.920]
They have very good bratwurst there and I come back here and right away I think I'm still

[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.300]
in Germany.

[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:56.600]
Okay.

[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:56.980]
I'm sorry.

[00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:57.680]
I apologize.

[00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:59.260]
I got a little bit carried away.

[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.800]
I mean, something is unreasonable of that to expect to be able to walk into a market.

[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:06.000]
You know, what the over took my brain there?

[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:07.640]
I just had a brain fart, I guess.

[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:12.700]
Assuming I could walk into a supermarket or into like a deli where they have like actual

[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:15.840]
sausages and bratwurst and all these things.

[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:17.240]
Excuse me.

[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.300]
Here's Coral Springs.

[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:19.640]
Hello.

[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:20.400]
Hello?

[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:20.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.120]
What's going on, man?

[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:23.580]
What's the deal?

[00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:25.840]
You know, here, are you talking about white rapids?

[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:27.540]
Are you like Eminem?

[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:30.040]
I know a white rapid who's like, he's from Miami.

[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:30.620]
Yeah.

[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:31.700]
His name is FEMA.

[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:33.320]
I saw him with the artillery constantly.

[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:35.980]
You know what I had to gunshots and if that wasn't all that.

[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:37.080]
Yeah.

[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.800]
You know the man you got to check him out.

[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:39.540]
No, I'll pass.

[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.420]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, rap sucks.

[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:46.260]
Okay, rap is for morons, rap is for idiots.

[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:47.020]
You got it, pal.

[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.720]
Rap is for people without a brain.

[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:50.600]
Rap, they left the sea off it.

[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:52.400]
Okay, they left the K off the beginning of the word.

[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.080]
They left the K off of a crap.

[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:55.500]
You got it, pal?

[00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:59.100]
Here's a mobile and deer field beach.

[00:54:59.220 --> 00:54:59.280]
Hello?

[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:00.620]
Hello?

[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:00.780]
Hello?

[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:01.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:04.400]
Just got back from Vegas, loved it.

[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:04.720]
Yeah.

[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.360]
They did the Mandalay Bay.

[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:10.320]
I wanted to ask you though, I was watching a TV for a couple of minutes and I see they

[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:12.840]
had the heads for the Tom Likus radio show.

[00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:14.460]
How come they don't do it down here?

[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.640]
They don't have heads for your show.

[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:16.500]
There are a lot of people.

[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:20.220]
Because I work for a bunch of cheap bastards who don't promote this station and don't

[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:23.580]
promote this show and it's a miracle we have any audience because I work for a cheap

[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:27.700]
bastard called the Beasley's and Greg Reed who's busy in Montana right now and that's

[00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:28.760]
you'll tell you a lot about his personality.

[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:31.960]
I mean, they're advertising him like every 20 minutes.

[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:33.780]
Yeah, well, we don't get any advertising.

[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:37.920]
And down here, I've been listening to you now for about 11 years, 10 years and they're

[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.360]
people when I say Neil Rogers, they go, who?

[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:41.760]
Exactly, that's right.

[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:43.360]
Unbelievable.

[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:45.860]
Anyway, that's all I've got to say, love you, Neil.

[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:46.460]
Thank you, sir.

[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:48.860]
Okay, there it is, a little salt in the wounds.

[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:52.240]
I mean, his intentions are good, but he doesn't ever seem to want to accept the fact that

[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:55.360]
they work for cheap pricks who don't want to spend any money to promote us because,

[00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:58.300]
you know, somehow we still manage to fumble our way through without it.

[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:03.300]
And they load up the log with 8 million spots and then they got to give all the money to

[00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:05.820]
John Henry and the Wayne and the just a vicious cycle here.

[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:09.380]
But in the meantime, like Hank says, just take the money, like Gildey says, like everybody

[00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:12.320]
around here says, if they've been here long enough, just take the money and run and they're

[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:12.540]
right.

[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:13.960]
They're absolutely right.

[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.720]
Because otherwise you could go nuts.

[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.220]
You can have a nervous breakdown from these people.

[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:26.220]
They absolute refusal, the inability, they just, you know, don't want to have anything

[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:29.200]
to do with the way this business is supposed to be conducted and they want to stick it

[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.320]
up the butt all the time.

[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.680]
But nevertheless, some people around here might like that.

[00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:34.720]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:34.980]
Hello?

[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:36.500]
Yes, man.

[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:36.980]
I think?

[00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:37.840]
Can't hear you at all.

[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:41.940]
Okay, I think the reason I should probably have it, I've got much responsible people

[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:45.320]
concerned about the penny sales time is that most of the folks that would have been

[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:47.260]
concerned are not living in day count anymore.

[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:50.240]
They feel that are still left here that would be concerned.

[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:53.980]
They're just waiting for retirement so that they can leave day count as well.

[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:54.380]
Yeah.

[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.680]
It is unfortunate to say it.

[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:58.340]
It's finished.

[00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:59.360]
Day count is history.

[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:00.600]
Yep, yep, yep.

[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:01.000]
You're right.

[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:02.180]
All right, bye bye.

[00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:02.560]
Thanks.

[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.200]
Now she's right.

[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:04.920]
Very succinct right to the point.

[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:05.780]
She's absolutely correct.

[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:09.620]
By the way, before I forget about it, yesterday I was mentioning the Newsweek magazine,

[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:13.060]
July 12th, and probably some people went after the news stand and they thought, what

[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:13.860]
is he talking about?

[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:15.380]
Is God dead on a front page article?

[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:20.100]
Because yesterday in a mail at home, I get my July 12th issue of Newsweek, the US edition,

[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:23.540]
not the European one that I bought the, where the hell was it, and I'm still there

[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:24.100]
at the airport.

[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:30.040]
And lo and behold, on the front cover of the one here, Latin USA, the article I was talking

[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.860]
about was Bill Drekkenair and our loud and all that bull crap.

[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:35.380]
I was really obnoxious, repugnant, unacceptable articles.

[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.860]
That's the front page story.

[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:41.260]
Now the thing about is God dead in Western Europe and sure can look that way in all the statistics

[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:42.240]
and the other stuff that I read.

[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:43.480]
Is that story in here at all?

[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:43.700]
No.

[00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:44.580]
Is there any mention?

[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:44.840]
No.

[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:45.560]
No.

[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:47.820]
How do you like that?

[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:51.300]
So you see in Europe in Newsweek, they can handle this.

[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:54.380]
They can handle the facts and they can deal with it because they realize that it's all

[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:55.100]
a bunch of bull crap.

[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:58.540]
But the American public were so brainwashing with the religion and horse crap, they got

[00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:02.320]
to have this garbage on the front page with Bill Drekken talking out loud.

[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:03.660]
Good show there, Bill.

[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:04.440]
That was cool.

[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:05.520]
Yeah.

[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:06.160]
That was great.

[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:09.980]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:10.280]
Hello?

[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:12.200]
Hey, Mio.

[00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:12.680]
How you doing?

[00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:13.240]
Okay, sir.

[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:18.960]
Listen, I'm going to go to know against the failed facts that come up this month.

[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:19.340]
Yeah.

[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.420]
And I think I'd like to say a little bit of a little story here.

[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:30.120]
I've got the sun pass views on 836 and they've made every lane, a sun pass lane.

[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.840]
So therefore you're stuck in every lane with backed up.

[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:34.380]
It's crazy.

[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:37.800]
What do you mean, every lane is a sun pass lane?

[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:38.560]
How can they do that?

[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:39.760]
They do.

[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:44.960]
Every lane has a big meta sign over the lane that they accept sun pass.

[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:50.700]
So therefore everybody, even the people who don't have sun pass can get in those lanes.

[00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:52.040]
So it's not a...

[00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:56.280]
So in other words, you're saying on the 836 there are no exclusive sun pass lanes?

[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:57.720]
You got it, baby.

[00:58:58.140 --> 00:58:58.500]
Brilliant.

[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:00.360]
Thanks for the good news.

[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:04.480]
Hey, also, it doesn't matter if they take out these top 5's or not.

[00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:06.420]
5 years from now traffic's going to double.

[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:07.860]
10 years is going to double.

[00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:08.620]
It doesn't matter.

[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:09.040]
Yeah.

[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:10.000]
Well, guess what?

[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:13.280]
No, what they don't understand is 5 years from now 90 percent of the people will move

[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:14.020]
out of the day county.

[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.300]
So it really doesn't make any difference.

[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:21.780]
56670560.560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.680]
Here's the lady in Kendall.

[00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:23.960]
Hello.

[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:25.200]
Hi, Neil.

[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:25.780]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:28.140]
I taught her on Saturday evening.

[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:30.760]
I was watching ET Entertainment tonight.

[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:34.800]
And you remember when you were raving about Jeff Topovich?

[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:35.660]
Yes.

[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:36.700]
The UN player?

[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:36.920]
Right.

[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:41.360]
Well, his brother Doug is far more gorgeous.

[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.600]
I guess they were more gorgeous.

[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:43.140]
How can you say that?

[00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:44.300]
They're identical twins.

[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:45.180]
They are?

[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:45.760]
Yeah.

[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:46.980]
Well, they don't look identical.

[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:48.820]
They sure look like it to me.

[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:49.920]
Well, I wonder.

[00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:53.320]
So I thought the one voice already graduated.

[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:54.000]
Yeah.

[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:55.040]
Well, maybe they're not.

[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:55.600]
I don't think so.

[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.480]
But they sure look like it in the pictures I saw.

[00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:58.820]
Oh, the way to see the other fellow.

[00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:00.080]
I did see him.

[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.240]
I've got the thing.

[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.020]
Oh, OK.

[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.220]
That way it was in the catalog for Abacrombian fish.

[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:05.800]
All right.

[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:06.880]
That's what they're modeling.

[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:07.520]
Right.

[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:09.640]
What you're going to see.

[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.240]
You'll notice when I brought that up, everybody around here went mum.

[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.780]
One or two people admitted they heard of him.

[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.900]
He worries number 38 or whatever for the hurricane.

[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.480]
But all of a sudden, as soon as they found out that he was a male model,

[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.220]
everybody in the sports people went mum like they never heard.

[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.440]
I have no idea what I'm talking about.

[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.660]
Oh, it's just unbelievable.

[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:32.940]
You know, what you were talking about, Brotworth, do you have a Borsehead section in your public?

[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:33.400]
Yes.

[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:38.640]
Well, in the big publics down here on US1, they have the Brotworths

[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.880]
in that section.

[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:40.280]
Really?

[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.200]
So you might double check it.

[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.640]
I think I'm going to have to talk to my people over there at publics because...

[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.780]
No, I'd like to be pushy and start bossing them around.

[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:51.280]
But I mean, is it like on American to go in there and buy Brotworths?

[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.240]
Is there something wrong with that?

[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.200]
No, they'll order it for you.

[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:56.160]
OK.

[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:57.260]
Thank you.

[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:57.740]
Bye-bye.

[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:03.480]
5-6705-60, pound 5-60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.800]
Here's a mobile in-for-lotter deal.

[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:05.060]
Hello.

[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:06.280]
Meal.

[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:06.720]
Yes, sir.

[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.400]
Brotworth's report.

[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:12.580]
It's called ML, EM-IL, ML sausage.

[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:16.720]
Eva Braun is behind the counter, whacking them up and making them.

[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.100]
Yeah.

[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:22.260]
You have to take federal highway, north to commercial.

[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:25.840]
OK, thanks a lot, pal.

[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.000]
And when you get to Jackson, by the way, make a U-turn, come back to Daytona.

[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:29.600]
That's where it is.

[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:30.880]
I'm not...

[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:31.520]
Don't you understand?

[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:34.460]
I mean, every time I ask, where can you get...

[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:35.260]
I'm killing a blank.

[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.280]
Where do you get...

[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.060]
Yeah, whatever it is.

[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:42.120]
And it's like, oh, well, if you drive up to commercial and you go all the way over to a federal highway,

[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:47.480]
and you make a U-turn and spin around, just pass loymes, you know, I'm not talking about that.

[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.540]
We're not talking rocket science.

[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:51.660]
Here we're talking about buying some goddamn meat.

[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:53.360]
That's what we're talking about, OK?

[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.540]
Where's the frickin' meat?

[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.780]
5-6705-60, pound 5-60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.860]
I'm not talking about that tool thing anymore.

[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:06.560]
I will never...

[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.220]
I'm never going to get sucked into that thing.

[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.180]
It's the worst...

[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.100]
I don't live in date.

[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.220]
I work just barely over the county line, and I hop on the turnpike, which the tools will continue to be there,

[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:15.900]
and I don't...

[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.020]
Doesn't bother me in the least bit.

[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:19.440]
And life goes on.

[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.260]
And you people live in date?

[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:21.840]
Screw you.

[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.940]
OK, you don't give a crap.

[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:23.400]
Screw you.

[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.960]
I'm not going to say you're going to keep being a spokesman and turn my guts out for a bunch of people that don't give a crap.

[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:29.680]
Screw it.

[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:30.860]
Good luck to you.

[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:31.960]
You'll need it.

[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:34.680]
Where are the exploding balls?

[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:46.500]
Yes, I'm a melted jet-roolly, or who floated in two towns.

[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.360]
And when I'd read all the arrows, I just can't pull it down.

[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:54.080]
Since all the gringos move the way that other try to get.

[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:59.800]
The enemy, I will do changes, laymen, that's to the enemy, anger out.

[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:05.560]
The anti-tank or others, it takes my time to roll and roll and roll.

[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:12.960]
And it's perfect for a town, where there's no life to be found.

[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:25.540]
Outside of what's really in the past, like robbing ATMs and juke-tings or isn't the hentel-hair locators to the arrogance and obstacle-bullio.

[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:29.740]
It's come, movie, said it's the bad that's already too long.

[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.640]
I'm reading when I get the case of black bean squirts.

[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:39.260]
And then I wipe my ass and I wipe a barrel of shirt of the anti-tank or others.

[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.300]
The anti-tank or others, it takes my time to roll.

[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:51.120]
The anti-tank or others, it takes my time to roll and roll.

[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:55.080]
There I was, black piggy.

[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:56.040]
I don't see.

[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:56.880]
Yes.

[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.860]
I'm coming to the channel for it.

[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.380]
It's hot away, that makes it, I hate robbers.

[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.100]
Let me go out.

[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:03.940]
It's a trade.

[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:05.060]
Four.

[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:12.820]
1132-560-WQM Rafael Resendas Ramirez Schwartz Puppy Compo, they caught him, okay?

[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:15.020]
The railway killer is in custody.

[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:15.620]
Happy now?

[01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:19.700]
And brought is still a hovering over 595 and 441 we think.

[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:25.900]
56670560-Pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:26.920]
Here's a mobile in Weston.

[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:27.140]
Hello.

[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:28.620]
Nail?

[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:29.640]
Yes, sir.

[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:34.120]
You can solve your sausage problem on the way home from your office today.

[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:42.680]
If you go over towards the turnpike to go home, keep on going to university and go up

[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:45.140]
and a block north of Johnson Street on university.

[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.320]
There's a place called International Sausage.

[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.640]
It's a European guy that's in here probably has his kids and his mother-in-law and everybody else

[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.240]
working there.

[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.700]
They make the sausage, they smoke the sausage, they learn how to do it.

[01:04:57.740 --> 01:04:57.780]
Yeah.

[01:04:59.000 --> 01:04:59.940]
Right there on the side.

[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.460]
And it's very reasonable, very nice people.

[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:04.420]
And they've been here a hundred years.

[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.160]
And it's on university?

[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:07.060]
Yes, sir.

[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:07.840]
Right.

[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.320]
It's literally a block north of Johnson Street right next to the sitcom station.

[01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:13.340]
Okay.

[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:14.960]
Thanks a lot.

[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:15.580]
Have a nice day.

[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:16.080]
There you go.

[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:16.940]
That's all of that problem.

[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:17.480]
No more meat.

[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:18.480]
Okay. Enough of the meat.

560-Pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:24.680]
Here's a lady mobile in Miami.

[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:24.960]
Hello.

[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.140]
You just said no more meat.

[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:32.540]
I was going to tell you about getting the real sausages out of Cologne that you never mind.

[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.260]
You're going ahead.

[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.660]
Well, it's going to be a drive for you.

[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.760]
There's a German deli at the point in beach.

[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:40.620]
It's only German.

[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.260]
Del order you buy the case and you can freeze it.

[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:43.560]
No.

[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.220]
But they bring it in from Germany.

[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:45.780]
Yeah.

[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.940]
A lot of the stuff like the Johnsonville, it's very Americanized.

[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.440]
That was in Cologne a couple years ago.

[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:52.840]
And Johnsonville's okay.

[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:55.960]
But the real good stuff you can get from that deli up there.

[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.600]
There's another one down here in South day.

[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.860]
But I know you don't come today today.

[01:05:58.900 --> 01:05:59.220]
No way.

[01:05:59.300 --> 01:05:59.580]
No way.

[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:00.520]
I can't afford the tools.

[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.520]
Oh, well, sorry.

[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:03.100]
Thanks.

[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:03.700]
Bye.

[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.380]
560-Pound 560.

[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:08.920]
We finally hit the raw nerve here today.

[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.860]
We hit the meat line.

[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:14.280]
567-0560-Pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:15.380]
North Miami.

[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:15.740]
Hello.

[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:16.960]
Hey, Neil.

[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:17.440]
Yes, sir.

[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:18.500]
I'm another meat guy.

[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:19.260]
I'm sorry.

[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:21.960]
But I'm moving.

[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:22.820]
I'm moving.

[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:23.180]
I'm moving.

[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.300]
I'm moving.

[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:25.800]
I've closed my business.

[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:26.920]
I'm here cleaning up.

[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.220]
I've been listening to you for years.

[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:29.760]
I'm in daycare and I'm leaving.

[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:30.340]
Really?

[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:30.740]
Yeah.

[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:35.920]
I've moved to Broward four years ago when they checked the insurance up so you couldn't even live here anymore.

[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.100]
And now my business, I'm closing it and I'm moving to Broward County.

[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:45.420]
And my sausage place is real near you and it's the original guy from the one on university.

[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:46.420]
Yeah.

[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.200]
And he makes it in the shop and it's on Biscayne Boulevard.

[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:52.860]
Two blocks from Pembroke Road going north.

[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.780]
Biscayne Boulevard in Pembroke Road.

[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:57.680]
We're in two different county.

[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.480]
You mean Federal Highway?

[01:06:58.900 --> 01:06:59.240]
No, no.

[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:00.500]
Biscayne Boulevard.

[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:01.720]
Let me think.

[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:02.400]
No, you're right.

[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:03.240]
Biscayne Boulevard.

[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:04.800]
Biscayne Boulevard in Dade County.

[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.860]
Tendrick Road is in Broward County, never the Twaints shall meet.

[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:09.640]
Biscayne Boulevard has in the Federal Highway.

[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:10.460]
You have one.

[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.520]
Just north of Pembroke Road.

[01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:12.960]
You know what?

[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:15.640]
We're on the Gulf Stream side but down the road.

[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.180]
I wouldn't go anywhere near there.

[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.360]
Very good.

[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:19.880]
He's European.

[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:20.780]
Probably right there.

[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.820]
There's plenty of Rosenberg over there.

[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:22.160]
Oh.

[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.000]
My good luck, Japan.

[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:24.980]
Yeah, you too.

[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:25.800]
Thank you so much.

[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.220]
Okay, 600 open lines here this morning.

[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.120]
It's really desperate.

[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:33.200]
Okay, I apologize profusely for getting all worked up about that stupid mayor penis.

[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:34.900]
I don't care about that crap, okay?

[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:36.480]
I just don't care.

[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:38.200]
If you don't care, why the hell should I care?

[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.180]
We just don't care, right?

[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:39.680]
Is that it?

[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:40.100]
Okay.

[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.040]
Should have checked before I started this morning, taking a survey.

[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:43.480]
Do you care?

[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:43.620]
No.

[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:44.360]
And they all would have said, no.

[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:47.480]
Then we could have moved on with life, talked about something important like where we get some good meat.

[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:52.660]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&P wireless line.

[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:53.880]
Here's a mobile in four-lotterdale.

[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:54.160]
Hello.

[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.980]
That guy was right on the university.

[01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:00.460]
He makes all kinds of different sizes.

[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:01.100]
It's real good.

[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:11.940]
And you'll even make them for you if you have a special recipe like up your own, or something you want to leave out something that you can't eat or something else you have to have for you too.

[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:14.660]
But also 95 Southbound.

[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:19.500]
A car exploded, some fire traffic has stopped at 84.

[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:22.640]
Right underneath the overpass.

[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.540]
All right.

[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:25.020]
I mean big fire.

[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:26.720]
Cars are not moving.

[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:27.240]
Excellent.

[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:29.000]
Thanks for the good news.

[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.100]
I know your traffic report won't stay at the top.

[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.400]
No, we don't have any traffic reports.

[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:35.660]
I have a TV set here with the small satellite dish.

[01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:36.940]
I have no contact with the outer world.

[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.640]
We don't even have a newswire in this station.

[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:41.080]
There's three helicopters looking.

[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:42.980]
Yeah.

[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:47.700]
It's not as exciting as the boat's floating in, but it's something.

[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:48.980]
Okay, thanks for the good news.

[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.460]
See, we have no contact with that.

[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.200]
We don't have the cable.

[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:56.200]
We don't have like, I mean, the antenna farm is only across the street from us.

[01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:59.180]
You know, if we were going to get, and by the way, what are we going to do about that Chuck situation?

[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:03.060]
I just tried again, which maybe his phone is off the hook or it's out of order.

[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.200]
Maybe he heard me say that we were going to get food from over there and they took the phone off the hook.

[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.520]
Chuck, if you're listening, what else is going on with your phone?

[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.440]
What are you looking like that?

[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.340]
I mean, we're going to have to get some lunch in here pretty soon.

[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:17.260]
And I'm really horny for Chuck's that really spicy, whatever the thing is.

[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:21.000]
But evidently, 5.6.7, oh, you finally got a ring.

[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.500]
See, you probably had the phone was off though.

[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:23.240]
He heard what I said.

[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:26.960]
See, if you're going to communicate, you got to get on the ear because Chuck's the one guy that's listening to the day.

[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:27.820]
He's the only one.

[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:31.060]
5.6.7.0, 5.60, 0.5.60.

[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:34.420]
I'm just going to play toy box and best friend the rest of the day over and over again.

[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:36.240]
I like it.

[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:38.560]
Of course, if you haven't seen the video, it loses something in translation.

[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:40.740]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:41.080]
Hello.

[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:42.860]
Me and what's going on with me?

[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:43.880]
Not a thing, pal.

[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:48.220]
Hey, I'm talking about this pending tax bull crap.

[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.100]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.900]
We're talking about that they raised tolls to 50 cents and all that crap.

[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.520]
Yeah, I'm listening.

[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:03.220]
Not only did they raise it to 50 cents, they had out of the seven possible lanes to get through there.

[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.220]
They had to be even closed.

[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:05.720]
Yeah.

[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.380]
Just to piss people off more.

[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:08.140]
You understand what I'm saying?

[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:08.680]
Yes, I do.

[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:10.380]
And that was the jackass.

[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.220]
Okay, thanks for the good news.

[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:12.900]
That's a bulletin.

[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:13.680]
Kishamistit.

[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:15.160]
One line, let up on the board.

[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:16.260]
Now we can go back to some music.

[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:16.800]
I'll play that.

[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.260]
What is that thing that I got from Norway?

[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:21.540]
Unforgivable center by Lynn A. Marlon.

[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:22.400]
That's number one in Italy.

[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:22.880]
Very big.

[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.380]
I'm going to play just European music since these people got nothing to say.

[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.840]
5.6.7.0, 5.60, 0.5.60, 0.5.60 on the AT&T line.

[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:35.480]
Why in God's name, seriously, if there is, if there is anything in the universe, if there's anything out there,

[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:39.240]
if even Mr. Spock is listening, why in the world did I come back to a place like this?

[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.820]
Where's my meat?

[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:45.760]
Crapital records is proud to present the Elvis album Everyone can win this war.

[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.540]
It's Elvis in Seattle.

[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:53.480]
I don't mind feeling brimmed from the mouths of decadence.

[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.040]
I'm getting hungry.

[01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.440]
Hey Red, give me a cheeseburger, man.

[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.340]
And see if the Colonel's guy left the rosarii.

[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.300]
I'm getting hungry.

[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.080]
That's right.

[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.880]
The King of Rock and Roll is playing the King's Ove.

[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.060]
And you've got a front row ticket.

[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:14.680]
Will Jeremy Spock in Class of the Elvis covers all the great Seattle bands.

[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:18.960]
Pearl Jam, Sounddust and the one that started it all, Nirvana.

[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:25.740]
Oh man, I'm a battle, my mosquito, my libido.

[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:32.000]
Elvis is very well and rocking Seattle only on Crapital records and tape.

[01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:35.180]
Massaged, there's some cheetos.

[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:37.940]
Mass and foes.

[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.220]
Man, potatoes.

[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.100]
Welcome 40, very much.

[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:43.060]
560, you're welcome.

[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:43.880]
WQM.

[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:47.960]
So anyway, Joe Castello's mom calls and says that the sausage shop that these people are recommending

[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.040]
the old world, whatever the name for was, that it sucks.

[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:54.920]
And that the good stuff is in Hollywood mall in that deli, which I know that place where that German guy runs it.

[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.120]
It's a German sausage shop.

[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.680]
Am I going to the Hollywood mall?

[01:11:59.580 --> 01:11:59.940]
No.

[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:01.040]
Is anybody else going in?

[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:01.260]
No.

[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:01.500]

[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.100]
But thanks to Mrs. Castello.

[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:07.800]
Thanks for the memories and I won't waste my time going around university in Johnson because she said it sucks.

[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:11.400]
By the way, Channel 10, Big Expo's a yesterday.

[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.440]
They got nothing better, no important news going on.

[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:17.840]
So what do they do? They can take a bunch of teenagers and they send them out to various movie theaters around town.

[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:18.580]
Did you see that thing?

[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:22.920]
To see who's getting ID and who's not getting ID into those R-rated movies?

[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:25.900]
Oh my god, America grow up already.

[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:35.520]
Because Bubba said, the same guy that's up there getting blow jobs and sticking the cigars in every or a orifice he can.

[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.360]
That's why they call it the Oval Orifice.

[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:46.340]
And he's talking to Trinik about, you know, now we got to start to check an ID and make sure because then we don't have to worry about violence.

[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:46.760]
Okay.

[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:50.540]
As long as you make sure your kids don't go to these sexual and violent movies got for bit.

[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:58.180]
I mean, is there anybody who in their right mind who really believes this goody two shoes of bull crap approach to life?

[01:12:58.220 --> 01:12:58.380]
No.

[01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:00.380]
Of course not. Does he believe it?

[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:00.680]
No.

[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.340]
Here's a mobile in derail. Hello.

[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:05.600]
Neil.

[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:06.160]
Yes sir.

[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:09.780]
Hey, it's been a long time. Probably five years. I'm your long lost.

[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.740]
Volusia County Nazi sheriff, correspondent.

[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:18.640]
Bob Vogel that makes the minority stop on 995.

[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:26.100]
At any rate, I live near the corner beach and I make 60% of my income driving on my Annie gate county roads.

[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:29.580]
And if they take the tolls down, it will be a blessing for me.

[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:33.280]
But you know what? I don't spend tax time number one.

[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.140]
I sleep in Broward for safety purposes.

[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:43.460]
And when I'm in a hotel down here, for nine years I've been listening to you on Mondays and Tuesdays and now we're going to do this.

[01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:46.960]
It's only going to benefit me but I don't spend any money in the gate county.

[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:51.240]
So, you know, let an asset on move. It's absolutely unbelievable.

[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:54.440]
And just for the record, the troopers are in on it now.

[01:13:54.620 --> 01:14:00.580]
It's 2, up in 95. So you guys that are running drugs, you may want to get on US one before you get to the borderline's exit 85.

[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:01.600]
Okay, thank you.

[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:02.500]
Good news. Thanks for the money.

[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:03.280]
Take care.

[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.100]
Oh, God.

[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.220]
Oh, Jesus. Are you fucking kidding me?

[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:10.740]
Oh, that's right. Don't let those kids under 17 see that South Park movie.

[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:13.420]
They're definitely going to be blowing each other's brains out.

[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:18.820]
They might even stick one of those Cuban bullets in their rectum from next.

[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.580]
Oh, crazy, crazy country man.

[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:28.760]
Let's just keep everybody like a 10-year-old, like a five-year-old, and then we don't have to worry about anything, you know?

[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:36.640]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the 8-course, the NRA. We want to make sure all the kids keep buying all the guns they want.

[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:37.240]
That's okay.

[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:43.340]
But don't let them buy a pack of those faggots or see some of those movies like South Park and all these other damn things.

[01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:45.180]
God.

[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:46.600]
He's coming out, bunch of assholes.

[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:47.400]
That must be it.

[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:50.240]
Here's a mobile and cave coral. Hello.

[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:51.700]
Neil God.

[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:52.240]
Yes sir.

[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:54.020]
Tom Green for Canadian President.

[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:54.260]
Right.

[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:56.200]
Take care of Green.

[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.780]
We're doing those Pepsi spots for the first time on MTV last night.

[01:14:58.860 --> 01:14:59.480]
Nice going Tom.

[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:00.860]
Oh, yeah, he's a man.

[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:04.080]
I left Dave. I left Howard.

[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.640]
Now I live with Fort Myers and there's some civility out here.

[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.260]
People are nice and respectful.

[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.040]
I think the word you're looking for though is boring.

[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:15.420]
I mean, it's pretty boring here. I can't even imagine how boring it's got to be there.

[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:16.280]
It's changing.

[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:17.160]
Yeah, it's changing.

[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:21.740]
They probably got some nice stuckeys there, you know, a long I-75 and some of those exits. They probably got a nice stuckey thing.

[01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:27.480]
You guys stay around the beach, even downtown Fort Myers. They have a little area there. Good enough base, bar.

[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:27.800]
No.

[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.800]
You gotta go out late night. That's it.

[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:30.200]
No.

[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:32.240]
And the people here are getting younger.

[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:32.740]
Yeah.

[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.580]
They're under 70 now.

[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:35.700]
Exactly.

[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:39.920]
Meeting ages down to 69. That's the only thing I'm going to fight over there, but that's a meeting age.

[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:46.300]
You know, the most frustrating part about listening to your show now is that I have to get filled in on all this Cuban neo-Hoki stuff going on.

[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:47.640]
You don't want to hear anything.

[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:50.000]
I don't want to know about it. Believe me. Trust me.

[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.320]
Hey, I close my douchebag.

[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:51.740]
Yes, sir.

[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:55.020]
Lenny, you're Cuban. Get out of Miami. And I love my dad.

[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:55.520]
Okay.

[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:55.900]
Thanks, Dale.

[01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:57.340]
Okay.

[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:00.280]
Five, six, seven.

[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:02.840]
So we finally got to it and check what was the story of the phone off the hook.

[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:06.860]
They got a couple of really big orders that they were dealing with.

[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:12.360]
You got some goddamn nerve, Mr. I mean, they got a couple of big orders.

[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:14.140]
I mean that somebody is actually paying for it.

[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:18.520]
We're looking to suck up a free lunch from them over here and disrupt their take into big orders.

[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:21.820]
And you got some nerve getting on the air and making a big think about that.

[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:24.760]
Why did five six seven, oh five sixty.

[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.520]
I'm going back on vacation. I'm serious. This really sucks.

[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:31.080]
Yesterday for Monday was it was okay. Not it was weak.

[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:32.580]
Pretty crappy.

[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:41.480]
But today my god to come in here and actually you got to pinch yourself every now and then make make you understand that you're awake and alive.

[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.140]
Maybe that's what Hank needed yesterday.

[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:47.060]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:48.640]
Hi Neil. Good morning.

[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:49.100]
Yes, sir.

[01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:54.960]
You know, I was in Cuba recently and they listened to you there in five sixty and in seven seventy.

[01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:55.620]
Yeah.

[01:16:55.700 --> 01:17:05.580]
A seven seventy has a problem before you that I mean if you ever wanted not to not to follow somebody that could be a problem.

[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:06.180]
Really?

[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:07.180]
Oh my god.

[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:10.100]
Oh my god.

[01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:16.940]
I was a guy that his old program for three days was about the fight that he had with his wife and his wife threw him out of the house.

[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:20.040]
And he called his wife in the job and she said I don't want to go.

[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:21.980]
I don't know. I know they carried Rick Raleigh on seven.

[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:24.880]
Oh no, no, no. It's one of the local jokers.

[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:25.700]
Oh, I see.

[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:26.960]
Really, really.

[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:29.240]
Listen, gentlemen.

[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:31.980]
At least it wasn't Don I was talking about his brother Fred on the.

[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:32.860]
No, it wasn't.

[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:33.840]
It was.

[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:36.000]
How was that man still on the air?

[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:37.560]
It just astonishes me.

[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:41.660]
A report from channel twenty three and Ilyana Rose Latina.

[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:51.460]
She is demanding from the Coast Guard to return to Miami the body or the corpse or the lady that drowned over the week.

[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:52.880]
Yeah, what's she going to do with it?

[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:57.020]
Well, they wanted to set up a big show if they get into here.

[01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:01.440]
Even though the family of this young woman is in Cuba.

[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.280]
Husband and family.

[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.120]
Maybe they can turn the body over to the Tom Green show on MTV.

[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:10.300]
So she's they can come up with some pretty creative things to do with him.

[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:19.780]
I'm demanding that and today a five o'clock they're going to have a picket in huge picket and they said against Bill Clinton on.

[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.700]
On in the entrance to go go plum.

[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:27.060]
Yeah, coming to a fun racing and mayor panelist is going to be there.

[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:27.600]
Uh huh.

[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:31.760]
Mayor Pinerius is going to be there.

[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:32.500]
Mayor panelists.

[01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:33.020]
Right.

[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:36.880]
So maybe OJ will be there at the same time.

[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:39.300]
That would be a good combination.

[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.300]
Maybe maybe OJ will be there.

[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:42.080]
We'll be nice.

[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:43.160]
Good to be okay.

[01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:43.580]
Thanks.

[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:49.480]
Not that we've been anything by that, Mr Mayor, but you got to watch your backside.

[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:50.260]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:50.900]

[01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.500]
Oh boy, just I see I can't deal with it anymore.

[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:56.700]
It's just too much of the same.

[01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:57.880]
That's why we all moved out of date.

[01:18:58.060 --> 01:18:58.180]
Okay.

[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.200]
If you live in date, don't take it personally unless you want to.

[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.260]
We just can't stand it.

[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:01.460]
Okay.

[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.420]
If that's your idea of the way you want to live.

[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:04.180]
Fine.

[01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:05.380]
It's a free country to a point.

[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:05.820]
Yeah.

[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:06.600]
That's what you want.

[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:06.920]
Fine.

[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:07.960]
We don't want any part of it.

[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:13.560]
Broward may have a lot of very old people and we may be very, very boring and very stale.

[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:14.200]
But you know something.

[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:16.280]
Sometimes stale isn't all that bad.

[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:19.300]
Here's a mobile in for a lot of Dale.

[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:19.560]
Hello.

[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.460]
Hello, Neil.

[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:22.040]
Yes.

[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.840]
Listen, Johnsonville sausage.

[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:27.300]
The best.

[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.080]
Johnsonville Brot.

[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:29.880]
From what?

[01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:31.820]
Johnsonville Brot.

[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:35.320]
There are the Wisconsin-Bout Wars.

[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.640]
And they have it all public as they're supposed to.

[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:38.040]
No, they don't.

[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:39.560]
Oh, man.

[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:46.020]
If they have brought, if they have brought wars, then my public, they must be hiding it in the place to just to make sure I can't find it.

[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:47.320]
Unbelievable.

[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:48.680]
I'm going in there again this afternoon.

[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:51.080]
I'm going to turn that store upside down looking for Brot.

[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.080]
Yeah, but ask for Johnsonville.

[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:53.620]
Looking for crowds.

[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:55.660]
Those are the real Wisconsin-Bout.

[01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:56.140]
Okay.

[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:57.280]
Okay.

[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:00.540]
And in closing, Mayor Penis, you're an asshole.

[01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:01.360]
Thank you.

[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:02.000]
What did you say?

[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:02.840]
He's an asshole.

[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.360]
5670560, 0.560 on the 18T line.

[01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:07.340]
Don't forget, just vote.

[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:07.580]
No.

[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:10.840]
Mayor Martinez, my good close friend, Raoul from Halea.

[01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:12.900]
He's coming out against the Penny sales tax today.

[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:15.280]
Always love that raw Martinez.

[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:15.800]
You know what?

[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:17.780]
There's a hell of a guy.

[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:18.540]
You don't mess with him.

[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:19.180]
That was from?

[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:19.460]
Yeah.

[01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:21.400]
Don't monkey around with him at all.

[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:23.860]
5667.

[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:26.040]
Oh, you don't mess with the Falconer.

[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:26.660]
You get the clause.

[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.760]
There's a word that goes in there but you know what it is.

[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:31.800]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.140]
Hello?

[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:34.100]
Yes?

[01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:37.140]
Okay, we just vote.

[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:37.640]
No.

[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:38.680]
On both things.

[01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:40.200]
The quarter end to Penny.

[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.300]
The corner is not on the ballot.

[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:47.200]
You either give him the penny or he's going to give you the shaft.

[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:48.000]
That's the way it works.

[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.640]
uh... comment like that means like pick your poison you know he's not easy to

[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.260]
do you know

[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.780]
yes or no that's it

[01:20:55.780 --> 01:21:00.880]
uh... okay well-enclosing uh... mayor panelist and all the good old

[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.700]
okay okay uh...

[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:07.360]
back to five sixes something about that he's got nice brown eyes you said five

[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.720]
six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty

[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:13.320]
on the eighteen t-wireless line never looked into his eyes to be honest with it

[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:16.660]
he looks kind of unappealing to me to be uh... very very uh... level with it

[01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:17.520]
he just the boring

[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:22.580]
but he's young and he's uh... different these bivaries the same old crap

[01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:26.340]

[01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:31.420]
ron it's got the same rotten smell it always has in his town always will

[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:35.480]
with the stamp of the hero right even though they moved out of town i

[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:37.660]
reader there's still here screw things up

[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:41.260]

you want to talk about you know you you say the fix election already

[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.300]
but right now

[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:49.700]
they're probably messing with the tolls

[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:53.320]
mixing things up making it so complicated for people to get through there

[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:57.380]
that people just gonna want to vote yes or this whole thing and exactly that's

[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:59.820]
what this whole thing is about it fact you know you raise a point they probably

[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:01.540]
have instructed the toll takers

[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:04.520]
and i don't want to confuse with my good friends on the turnpike the toll

[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.300]
takers because they're very nice people most of them but the people on those

[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:10.780]
toll roads they're in date county they probably instructed them to be as inept

[01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:13.880]
and incompetent as possible to make sure that this is the biggest disruption

[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:16.280]
these people's lives so that they'll get sucked into voting

[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:18.060]
and that goddamn penny sales tax

[01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:21.320]

they've only had six thousand letters from assholes like you and it still loves

[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:16.280]
us

[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:18.580]
oh

[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:19.260]
oh

[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:38.420]
they remade

[01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:38.680]
practice

[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.180]
they

[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:43.500]
move

[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:46.660]
for their mid-room market plastered with its face.

[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.220]
He likes some drops.

[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:51.180]
Yeah, all them teeny bombs,

[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.100]
when he's held his bump and left.

[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:54.260]
They're rebounds sage.

[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.180]
Short, T's a star.

[01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:59.140]
But I don't care what he are.

[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:01.980]
And if you think I'm to tell him that's okay.

[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:05.020]
Don't get me started.

[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:07.000]
I'll break you, Rinky Martin.

[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:10.080]
He might just lose a lot of fans.

[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:10.740]
Yeah.

[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:12.980]
Because if he can't get me started,

[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:14.860]
I'll break you, Rinky Martin.

[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.900]
I'll tell you he really loves a man.

[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:18.360]
Oi!

[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.900]
You don't get me started.

[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.740]
I'll break you, Rinky Martin.

[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:25.720]
I don't care how much that he makes.

[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.820]
Because if he can't get me started,

[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.680]
I'll break you, Rinky Martin.

[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:33.740]
I'll not just throw the rumor, he's a flake.

[01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:36.540]
What do you see? It's a flake, flake.

[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.580]
That damn fact that I can't stand it.

[01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:40.200]
The club won it 560 WQM.

[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:41.580]
We got the award winning Hank Goldberg show.

[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:43.580]
By the way, Hank was the employee of the month for May,

[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:47.160]
which that memo wasn't released until June 30, 1999,

[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:50.280]
which was interestingly enough, the day I left for vacation.

[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.700]
And Hank was then the employee of the month for the month of May,

[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.780]
which wasn't released until June 30 by Greg Read.

[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:56.620]
I wonder if that's all about.

[01:25:58.060 --> 01:25:58.900]
Nice going, AirHumper.

[01:25:59.460 --> 01:25:59.840]
Wake up.

[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:04.040]
5607 0560, 0560 on the mobile one line.

[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:06.220]
See, we have a little pool we take every day.

[01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:07.400]
I shouldn't probably say this on the air.

[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:08.980]
We have a little pool we do in here.

[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:10.740]
Everybody comes running into this room.

[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:14.480]
And at 2 o'clock when that theme music starts, you know?

[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:17.820]
Yeah, we do whatever theme it is.

[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:20.160]
We have an office pool to see how many seconds of that air

[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:22.380]
before the hump will actually get started.

[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:24.240]
Or they actually open the pot and get them on the air

[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.080]
when he's over there at Chulose.

[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.180]
There's our good buddy Chuck.

[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:27.440]
Thank you, sir. We're sorry that George

[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:29.180]
was trying to interrupt your big order over there,

[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:31.780]
which we'll never do again, since the other people are pan.

[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:33.940]
There's our good buddy Chuck from the sub center

[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:37.440]
on the corner of 441 and 190 on 9th, which is Ives Dury Road.

[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:39.460]
And you don't have to pay any toll to get there, by the way,

[01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:40.160]
at least not from here.

[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:40.800]
Not yet.

[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:43.800]
Here's a mobile in Pembert Pine.

[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:44.100]
Hello.

[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:45.720]
Hey, how you doing, Neil?

[01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:46.500]
Great.

[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:47.520]
Hey, good.

[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:50.040]
Just come back and just get back to make it.

[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.780]
There's Chulose because it went there for the first time.

[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:53.060]
What an awesome place.

[01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:53.760]
Yes, it is.

[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:54.680]
Awesome, awesome.

[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.240]
Sure, wouldn't want it to be like that here.

[01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:58.980]
Would we, sir, to have all those great smiling people,

[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.980]
young living and breathing people having a great time

[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:02.300]
spending all our hard-earned money?

[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:03.900]
We sure don't want that here, do we?

[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:05.000]
The only thing was the heat.

[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:07.360]
The second day we were there was 120 degrees.

[01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:07.720]
What?

[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:08.960]
No sweat.

[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.080]
Because you're inside all the time.

[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:12.560]
Well, no, we were outside.

[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:13.940]
I was with a family and everything.

[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:17.940]
And, you know, I don't know how to explain.

[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:21.420]
I mean, I take the garbage out here and I'm sweating here

[01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:22.440]
in a 85 degrees.

[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:23.560]
But, you know, the other day.

[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.500]
120 out there, don't feel like more than 115, you're right.

[01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:27.960]
Okay, listen, get a new phone pound.

[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:28.720]
That had a great time.

[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:31.200]
Yeah, we don't want anything like that here.

[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:33.080]
See where prisoners, okay, where prisoners,

[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.460]
there's nothing we can do about it.

[01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:35.860]
We can scream, we can bellyache.

[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:36.840]
Let's just vote.

[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:37.140]
No.

[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.180]
I'm July 29th.

[01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:39.440]
Those of you who live in data, I can't vote

[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.160]
because I don't live there.

[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:40.880]
But just vote.

[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:41.200]
No.

[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:42.120]
Two or three hundred times.

[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.200]
And then after that, we'll figure out what else we do.

[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:47.060]
About people like that asshole Bobby Butterworth

[01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:49.900]
and the governor Boots and all these other obnoxious,

[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:50.580]
anxious people.

[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:53.480]
And the people of the hero who just want to keep saying,

[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:53.680]
no.

[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:56.180]
To casinos and anything related to it because it's so evil.

[01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:58.420]
Like God forbid those cruise ships should be, you know,

[01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:01.060]
docking at the ports of South Florida.

[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:02.600]
Those gambling cruises.

[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:03.620]
What's head cap on it?

[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:05.560]
I guess he's going to have to swim out the ships, huh?

[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:09.700]
Here's four Myers for the question mark.

[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:09.980]
Hello.

[01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:11.620]
Neil Gawd.

[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:12.020]
Yes, sir.

[01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:14.940]
You know, I just have the luxury of having in-laws

[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:17.700]
that live about 10 miles north of Johnsonville.

[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:19.420]
Where you get the good brought?

[01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:20.040]
Yeah.

[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:23.160]
They smug will men like cigars when they come down there

[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.140]
to visit me every year.

[01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:24.700]
Uh-huh.

[01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:27.480]
And I've been passing brought for a week.

[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:29.580]
The other thing is I-

[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:31.080]
I supply you-

[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:33.040]
Maybe that's why George had a question mark on the book.

[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.540]
I supply you a keto stick.

[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:37.220]
By the year or two ago.

[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:37.600]
Right.

[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:38.620]
Are you still using them?

[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:39.040]
No.

[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:39.640]
No.

[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:41.540]
I actually never used them.

[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:42.420]
You never used them?

[01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:44.100]
I mean, don't feel bad, but I appreciate it.

[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:44.980]
But I just never-

[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:46.920]
No, I'm not that thing of going into ketosis.

[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:48.260]
No, well, that's good.

[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:50.300]
I'm glad to hear you had a good trip.

[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:52.140]
I'm worried to go into like Catedtonia,

[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:53.440]
which is why I come in here every morning

[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:54.540]
besides looking to get paid.

[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.400]
Okay, getting on the cubist subject.

[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:57.680]
Are you still having a-

[01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:58.500]
Is the cubist subject?

[01:28:58.760 --> 01:28:58.960]
Yeah.

[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:02.400]
I used to have a administrator

[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.600]
to a man who was cubist.

[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:07.400]
What a racist-

[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:08.720]
Bastard.

[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:09.000]
It was.

[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:09.400]
Yeah.

[01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:11.400]
I ended up getting a fire

[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:12.600]
because the racial remarks.

[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:13.300]
Uh-huh.

[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:16.060]
I never saw somebody so arrogant in my life.

[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:16.460]
Really?

[01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:17.240]
Yeah.

[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:20.420]
And if I could just call her a smelly,

[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:22.920]
I appreciate it.

[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.500]
Okay, maybe she knows Gloria's stuff on.

[01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:25.380]
Okay, got a bless you there.

[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:26.240]
And it goes in here?

[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:26.640]

[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:27.540]
Uh-uh.

[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.040]
You'll- Scott Plaskin,

[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.500]
you're a water pass and dish-

[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:30.680]
Okay.

[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:33.300]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:35.100]
pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:36.340]
We've got a couple lines waiting for you.

[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.320]
By the way, Joe Costello,

[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:38.600]
a good spot there before,

[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:39.720]
but he can't pronounce his name right.

[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.660]
No, seriously, you think that because your name is spelled

[01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:45.520]
with an A and not an O that's Castello,

[01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:46.320]
but it's not.

[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:47.760]
Because you're Italian.

[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.260]
A is never pronounced like-

[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:50.640]
A.

[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:52.960]
It's always A in Italian.

[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:53.920]
Your name is Costello,

[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:54.840]
and it's spelled correctly.

[01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:57.100]
That's right.

[01:29:57.340 --> 01:29:58.300]
I'm just getting a little information.

[01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:01.240]
I brought you back my pictures of Milan there in the Duomo,

[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:04.780]
which only cost me about $75 million to go see the guy

[01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:05.920]
named Duomo there in Milan,

[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:08.520]
and state that pretty much just a boy hotel in Milan,

[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:10.080]
which is a beautiful hotel,

[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:11.920]
but very, very overpriced.

[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:14.780]
$7 a piece for a small,

[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:15.680]
coke light.

[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:17.440]
Crazy people.

[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:20.820]
No, thank you.

[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:22.200]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.060]
I can't afford it.

[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:24.800]
And, £5,60 on a mobile one-line.

[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:25.940]
Here's Miami.

[01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:26.240]
Hello?

[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:27.680]
Niggah Neal.

[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:28.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:31.440]
Oh, yeah, by the way, I thought George did a very good job last week.

[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.200]
That's the report.

[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:33.600]
I have no complaint so far.

[01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:34.380]
No complaints.

[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:36.160]
He must have been a spectacular job.

[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:36.960]
Very entertaining.

[01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:38.180]
Listen, there isn't a point.

[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:39.120]
And the job I'll tell you,

[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.040]
fill it in to an issue,

[01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:41.440]
I did this time of the year in his town.

[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:42.720]
He must have done a hell of a job.

[01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:45.420]
Well, the reason I'm following up,

[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:48.500]
I was at a dance club down in Kendall a couple weeks ago.

[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:49.100]
Who is this?

[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:50.200]
This sounds like a very-

[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:51.620]
kind of like Harvey from Kendall or something.

[01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:52.640]
No, no, no, no.

[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:53.420]
This isn't a prank call.

[01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:55.860]
Listen, I was at a dance club and...

[01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:57.200]
No, this voice-out for Mayor George?

[01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:58.460]
Sounds like rich factor.

[01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:00.280]
I promise you.

[01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:03.360]
Listen, I was at a dance club with some friends.

[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.740]
And I walked into the bathroom

[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:06.640]
and the one of the stalls

[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:08.400]
and I locked the door behind me.

[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:08.980]
Yes.

[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:10.960]
And I was partaking of a substance

[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:12.080]
that I shouldn't have been using.

[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:13.020]
I was doing something...

[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:13.820]
You were looking for glory holes.

[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:14.540]
It wasn't cool.

[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:17.420]
But anyway, I was at the stall with the door locked.

[01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:20.440]
Next thing I know, there's a security guard.

[01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:21.920]
On one side of the stall looking down at me,

[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:22.920]
one on the other side,

[01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:24.020]
and one from behind.

[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.620]
And I immediately dropped what I had,

[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:28.620]
which wasn't much in the toilet and flushed it.

[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:29.120]
Back then.

[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.320]
And they asked me to step out,

[01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:32.520]
and I thought I was going to go to jail.

[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:34.500]
But they ended up escorting me out of the club,

[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:36.900]
which was full of embarrassing, obviously.

[01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:39.120]
But anyway, what was disconcerting is that,

[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:42.080]
I thought in the stall you would have a reasonable expectation

[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:42.960]
of privacy.

[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:46.400]
Obviously, these people can watch you decorate.

[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:47.240]
Absolutely.

[01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:47.920]
You bet.

[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.000]
I mean...

[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:49.500]
They're into it.

[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:53.140]
You're sitting in there squeezing it,

[01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:54.520]
and they're watching squeezing it.

[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:55.120]
I guess so.

[01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:58.200]
Well, anyway, out there that does that be careful,

[01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:01.320]
because obviously, these perverts can watch you do whatever

[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:02.200]
you're doing in there.

[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:03.720]
Hey, I got news for you.

[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:05.940]
The priest, you got those little hidden cameras fixed up

[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:07.720]
on the other side of the confessional boots now.

[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:08.960]
They're having a hell of a time.

[01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:10.580]
I'm sure they are.

[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:11.440]
Okay, don't do it again.

[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:11.740]
All right.

[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:12.840]
There you go.

[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:14.340]
That was rich factors been doing drugs.

[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:16.340]
What do you laugh at about?

[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:17.760]
Didn't that sound like rich-packed or do you?

[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:20.140]
We had that kind of like, you know, that bad nasal thing

[01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:20.580]
that was voice.

[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:22.520]
And speaking of rich-packed, you know,

[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:23.640]
we haven't heard from it a long time.

[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:24.560]
Not that I'm complaining.

[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:28.240]
But both your best friend and rich-packed,

[01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:28.840]
there's best friend.

[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.160]
Haven't heard from him in a long time.

[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:32.580]
Maybe that curates you, slightly overflowed.

[01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:36.300]
It's safe.

[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:38.160]
In Miami, town.

[01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:40.880]
At five, six, oh.

[01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:42.700]
WQA.

[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:42.860]
Yeah.

[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:43.500]
Yeah.

[01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:48.260]
Yeah, baby, baby.

[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:53.140]
Yeah, baby, baby.

[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:53.420]
Yeah, baby, baby.

[01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:56.320]
I guess you're supposed to know.

[01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:01.000]
I'm gonna shag you rotten.

[01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:03.900]
Yeah, baby, baby.

[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:05.580]
I'm swinging the luck.

[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:07.100]
You know.

[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:11.580]
Hope you're not a film bot.

[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:12.080]
Yeah.

[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:12.680]
Oh, I'm going to be a film bot.

[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:13.060]
Oh, honey.

[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:15.680]
Is that what I make you?

[01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:17.920]
Who-who, tell me, baby?

[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:22.380]
Because I need to know now, because

[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:26.260]
that's what evil wants you to be

[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:30.900]
with my little friend's mini-me.

[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:36.200]
Yeah, but I still think it's not getting 69.

[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:38.040]
But just terrifying.

[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:39.440]
Yeah, behave.

[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.740]
Come on, baby, it's Shaggy time.

[01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:46.180]
What is that thing that you're eating, by the way?

[01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:48.200]
I don't want to kid you with a mouthful of food.

[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:48.740]
What is that?

[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:50.600]
It's a chopped steak with onions and cheese.

[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:51.600]
And some steak sauce.

[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:52.360]
Wow.

[01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:54.340]
Looks pretty damn good.

[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:55.200]
Not that this isn't good.

[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:56.440]
This is great, but I'm just, you know.

[01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:59.300]
Anyway, somebody factors me about the old

[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:00.520]
Heidelberg in Fort Lauderdale,

[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:02.720]
which I know has been there for about 100 years on St. Rodin

[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:03.020]
before.

[01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:05.000]
It says they've got a deli next door with everything you need.

[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:06.620]
And it is.

[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:07.160]
You're right.

[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:08.260]
It is too far out of my way,

[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:09.880]
but nevertheless this will kill some good time.

[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:12.720]
And you'll continue to search for some of that good meat.

[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:15.480]
567, we've got 600 open lines here.

[01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:17.140]
567, 0560,

[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:19.280]
pound 560 on the mobile one line.

[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:22.400]
Here's the mobile in Cutler Ridge.

[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:22.660]
Hello.

[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:24.700]
Neil God.

[01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:25.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:27.100]
I have a question for you.

[01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:30.400]
These people who are putting all these restrictions out

[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:34.600]
for photo ID and, you know, trying to be the Bible Fumpers.

[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:37.140]
Aren't these the people back in what we call

[01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:37.920]
hippies, I guess?

[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:38.860]
I'm a baby boomer.

[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:42.880]
And I know that the people that are trying to impose these things,

[01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:45.320]
or these are people that were free sex, drugs,

[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:46.100]
and rock and roll,

[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:47.500]
are these the same type of people?

[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:48.400]
You mean like Bubba?

[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:48.660]
Yeah.

[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:50.380]
Yeah, well, I mean, you know,

[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:51.760]
what is it with good footage?

[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:52.840]
Is it good for the gander?

[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:53.080]
Right.

[01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:55.260]
I raised my kid the same way.

[01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:55.980]
Don't do what I do.

[01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:57.340]
It's the old parroting line.

[01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:59.320]
You know, don't do what I do, do what I say.

[01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:00.760]
Well, it says I did.

[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:02.000]
I mean, I don't know about you,

[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:03.460]
but I wasn't a angel growing up.

[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:04.780]
And I learned from that,

[01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:06.500]
and I'm teaching my kid to grow up properly.

[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:08.720]
And I'm not going to do it.

[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:10.680]
I mean, sit down and just talk to your kid.

[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:11.640]
That's all you got to do.

[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:13.540]
Yeah, the idea that because a kid,

[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:15.080]
15 or 16 years old,

[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:16.520]
goes to see an R-rated movie

[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:18.500]
that it's going to change his behavior,

[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:20.780]
is so ludicrous and so ashenine,

[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:21.860]
it's the same, you know,

[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.240]
like the people at Prohibition,

[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:25.100]
you know, with booze and with every other guy, then thing.

[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:26.120]
You're right.

[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:28.780]
And it's like the movie that did just came out with,

[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:30.780]
that forget Apple Pie or whatever it is,

[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:33.260]
the movie is based towards that group of kids

[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:34.960]
that are going through it to a hard time,

[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:36.840]
that can help these kids come out, you know,

[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.180]
from what I understand,

[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:39.180]
a real hard time, yeah.

[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:39.840]
Yeah.

[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:40.980]
That's what I hear.

[01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:41.800]
That's right.

[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:42.980]
I will go with Neil.

[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:43.540]
And back to you.

[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:44.200]
Thank you.

[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.040]
Anybody see that movie, by the way?

[01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:46.840]
American Pie?

[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:50.240]
Not yet. Looks good.

[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:51.660]
That's what I hear.

[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:54.140]
Sounds like my kind of movie.

[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:57.200]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:58.120]
05, 5, 60,

[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:00.000]
on the mobile one line.

[01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:01.860]
So let's get a few bratwars and go see it.

[01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:03.900]
Here's Miami Lakes.

[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:04.200]
Hello.

[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:07.380]
Miami Lakes.

[01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:08.300]
Yes, Neil.

[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:08.860]
Yes, sir.

[01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:13.580]
I want to call you and shed a little light on the Cuban thing.

[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:15.040]
Well, what does that mean?

[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:16.600]
What is the Cuban thing?

[01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:17.560]
What does that mean?

[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:18.820]
The roadblock incidents.

[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:24.060]
And something that everyone is failing to bring up

[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:25.240]
or at least I haven't heard it in a while.

[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:26.480]
What's that kind of roadblock again?

[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.740]
I thought that was two weeks ago.

[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:30.960]
Well, I've heard that they're planning other protests

[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:34.440]
and incidents like that.

[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:36.960]
And one thing I haven't heard addressed

[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:41.080]
is the impact that they have when they come here.

[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:44.040]
They act like they just come in, swim up on shore.

[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:45.260]
Okay, great. Thank you.

[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:48.440]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:50.360]
05, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:51.580]
I am so sick and tired.

[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:52.820]
You know something I'm going to tell you right now.

[01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:55.100]
I don't ever want to hear the word Cuban again as long as I live.

[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:57.100]
When I was in Amsterdam,

[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:58.120]
I hear the word Cuban.

[01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:58.540]
No.

[01:36:58.720 --> 01:36:59.500]
In Cologne, Germany.

[01:36:59.500 --> 01:36:59.900]
Cuban.

[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:00.360]
No.

[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:01.720]
How about in Milan, Italy?

[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:02.140]
Cuban?

[01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:02.540]
No.

[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:03.780]
Did I hear anybody speaking Spanish?

[01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:04.420]
No.

[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:04.900]
That's it.

[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:06.360]
End of conversation.

[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:07.600]
I don't ever want to hear it again.

[01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:10.100]
I just, I severed myself from it.

[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:11.260]
I'm sick of it.

[01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:13.040]
I'm saturated with it.

[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:15.800]
I don't want to see any more Cubans swimming around in the ocean.

[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.740]
I'm when I'm trying to watch Guiding Light on CBS on Channel 4,

[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:20.640]
which I'm forced to watch the local affiliate.

[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:22.700]
I don't want to hear about it.

[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:28.340]
Just kiss the God then ground that you're hearing.

[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:29.260]
You're not down there.

[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:30.480]
And then let's get out with life.

[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:30.840]
Okay.

[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:31.900]
Let's move on.

[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:37.180]
5, 6, 7, you people like this guy and that woman before it,

[01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:38.080]
it's calling the White House.

[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:41.000]
So, I'm looking to look for somebody to be waving an American flag.

[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:42.380]
Get with it, okay?

[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:46.040]
If you're waiting for that, then you better move to America,

[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:47.980]
which you're not in in case somebody didn't tell you already.

[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:48.320]
Okay.

[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:49.080]
You're not in America.

[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.220]
Now, what does that mean?

[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:53.820]
Online three.

[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:54.880]
What does that mean?

[01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:56.260]
Korea?

[01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:56.760]
Korea.

[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:57.740]
There was a war there.

[01:37:58.120 --> 01:37:59.480]
We tell you.

[01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:00.100]
Hello.

[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:00.300]
Yes, sir.

[01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:00.960]
You're in Korea?

[01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:02.640]
I am in Korea.

[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:03.340]
How about that?

[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:05.120]
This isn't Paul.

[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:05.980]
Are you ready to do that?

[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:07.460]
I'm sorry?

[01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:08.900]
I said, how you doing?

[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:10.780]
I'm doing really good.

[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:17.540]
Well, I was listening to you and I wish I was back in my annual now.

[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:19.920]
As bad as it is, I wish I was back over there.

[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:22.240]
This place is awful.

[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:23.020]
What are you doing there?

[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:26.340]
I'm doing my job over here working for Uncle Sam.

[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:27.200]
Oh, I see.

[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:29.500]
And I'm going to be shocked.

[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:31.300]
I want to call and say hello to you guys.

[01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:34.380]
You're doing the Miami and by the 20 years' duration, I think you're doing very good.

[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:35.420]
No, we're doing really bad.

[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:38.380]
No matter how bad it is in Korea, you're way ahead of the game.

[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:39.980]
Oh, you think so.

[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.080]
It's the end of the world here, sir.

[01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:42.620]
Believe me.

[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.860]
Well, if you were over here, you think different.

[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:47.480]
I mean, this is really awful over here.

[01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:53.000]
It's one in the morning over here and I decided to call and say hello to you.

[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:54.440]
I'm going to call the top show host there.

[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:55.320]
Can I say that?

[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:56.100]
Sure.

[01:38:57.220 --> 01:38:57.520]
Sure.

[01:38:58.260 --> 01:39:00.000]
Anyway, can I call somebody?

[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:03.080]
I really have not been listening to you show because I'm over here.

[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:04.320]
Can I call somebody to beach bag?

[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:05.160]
I'm going to get out here.

[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:05.320]

[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:06.500]
So, America, last time we checked.

[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:06.840]
Go ahead.

[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:08.220]
Last time I did.

[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.020]
All right, let me call Fernando and Omar.

[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:11.960]
I do a bag.

[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:13.860]
And when you're getting back...

[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:15.080]
And you take care of yourself.

[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:16.360]
When you get out of here...

[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:17.300]
Okay, and have a great day.

[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:18.200]
Good night.

[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:18.960]
Say goodbye.

[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:22.020]
Nothing like talking to somebody on the other side of the world.

[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:23.720]
You know, with that delay, you know, like...

[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:24.320]
Yeah.

[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:26.420]
Huh?

[01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:28.780]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:30.500]
Palm 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:32.160]
We got 600 open lines here today.

[01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:35.480]
Let's talk about that electric chair, huh?

[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.720]
See, even in something as simple as that, they can't do that right in Florida.

[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:43.760]
Even executing somebody.

[01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:44.820]
Lethal injection.

[01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:46.060]
Even a state like Oklahoma.

[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:47.240]
Texas.

[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:49.560]
Where they have all those red necks, all those mugwams.

[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:52.200]
They've been doing lethal injection for years in those places.

[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:53.400]
Not in Florida.

[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:57.640]
Florida, we have to keep getting these arguments about...

[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:01.100]
His old Sparky working right and the nose bleed and was it the...

[01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:03.540]
The fire shooting out of his head.

[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:04.620]
All this other crap.

[01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:08.140]
Because even something as basic as that, we can't do right.

[01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:14.040]
This state is run by a bunch of dumb ass crackers is what it is.

[01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:16.120]
That's what this state's all about.

[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:18.580]
A bunch of dumb ass crackers.

[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:22.080]
Like a lot walking, a lot and they won't walk and do good anymore.

[01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:23.940]
They're heat-cooned and the she-cooned.

[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:30.600]
And that dead man buddy McCay that they ran against the butcher mice to there.

[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:32.040]
A bunch of crackers.

[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.840]
Oh, Jesus, I wasn't that serious.

[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.000]
It's just a shame they can't televised these executions.

[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:40.460]
Yeah.

[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:42.100]
That'd be a hell of a...

[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:44.340]
They've got a 95-year-round one with the nose bleed.

[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:45.200]
That would have gone over a pig.

[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:46.340]
Yeah, can you imagine?

[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:47.500]
Put it on Fox.

[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:52.040]
Especially if they had something like a scratch and sniff, we could actually smell it.

[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:54.360]
Yeah, like for this call.

[01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:58.500]
Anyway, I don't know why you associate me with Rich Pacto.

[01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:00.140]
I still can't figure that out.

[01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:01.600]
Because you hate each other like Poison?

[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:03.780]
I haven't seen that guy in over ten years.

[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:04.260]
Yeah.

[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:06.720]
Since you and Stan were doing back-to-back shows.

[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:07.580]
No, please don't.

[01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:08.420]
I shouldn't stand, mage.

[01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:08.740]
You're okay.

[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:10.820]
I wasn't such a good mood up until then.

[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:12.040]
Stop with that heavy breathing.

[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:13.240]
What I thought would be a breathing.

[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:13.740]
Hey, listen.

[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:17.600]
Have you ever heard of a doctor by the name of Diadamo?

[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:18.460]
No.

[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:21.380]
Have you ever heard of the concept of eating for your blood type?

[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:24.300]
Yeah, that's another one of those old books.

[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:25.040]
That's crap.

[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:26.500]
I got that book.

[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:27.780]
You got that book?

[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:29.760]
Yeah, that was out like five years ago.

[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:31.900]
I had that sitting around with dust on it somewhere at home.

[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:33.200]
What blood type are you?

[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:34.160]
I have no idea.

[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:34.700]
I forget.

[01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:37.440]
Well, you should find out.

[01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:40.280]
Are you with the call with this health kick again?

[01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:41.940]
I'm in the middle of a nice lunch here in your store.

[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:43.500]
No, I'm not.

[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:44.200]
No, I'm not.

[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:44.660]
No, I'm not.

[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:45.180]
But you should.

[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:48.480]
There's a section in there where you talk about why acne doesn't work for everybody.

[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:48.840]
Yeah.

[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:49.980]
And what's the reason?

[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:54.940]
Well, it's just certain blood types, according to him, if you believe the concept, are

[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:57.360]
designed to eat more of a vegetarian diet.

[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:03.560]
Typo's, which is the majority of the population, are meant to eat protein, high protein, and for

[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:04.660]
those people it works for.

[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:09.600]
But for people like me who are type B minus and Z-negative and...

[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:10.660]
Your type was Z minus?

[01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:11.720]
Z-negative.

[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:14.180]
No, I don't want to be negative.

[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:14.980]
I want to be positive.

[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:18.040]
Well, you got to be positive up here.

[01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:19.760]
We were having Cuban problem in up in Boka.

[01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:21.580]
We got a Brazilian problem.

[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:23.460]
Oh!

[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:25.280]
You're at the beach.

[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:25.760]
You see the...

[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.840]
Yeah, but I bet you the dress stores are busy.

[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:30.320]
That's what I was going to tell you.

[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:33.260]
You see this gorgeous Brazilian girl on the beach.

[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:35.520]
You start getting friendly with her.

[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:37.320]
You try to help her out with the bikini.

[01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:38.880]
You find out there's a little extra there.

[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:41.940]
And let me tell you, it happens all the time.

[01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:43.700]
Yeah.

[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:46.820]
How bad.

[01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:49.900]
I can't put anything on that.

[01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:52.060]
I'll have mine chopped off.

[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:53.240]
Well...

[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:57.040]
I hate to admit it's a great job last week.

[01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:58.080]
Ty, do you like that?

[01:42:58.600 --> 01:42:59.480]
He really did.

[01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:01.460]
I actually did not tune him out.

[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:06.300]
You're trying to say the other time he's been on you or tuned him out?

[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:08.500]
He gets better every time he comes on.

[01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:09.060]
He really does.

[01:43:09.180 --> 01:43:09.300]
Great.

[01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:10.900]
Wait till tomorrow he's going to be sensational.

[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:12.720]
Have a good...

[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:12.920]
Today.

[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:16.840]
Yeah, he's going to be fantastic because after this, I mean, who they'll need this.

[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:18.940]
Let's keep those checks coming Greg.

[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:23.480]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a mobile one line.

[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:25.680]
The famous Paul Harvey Jr. for those who have missed.

[01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:27.720]
You know, see we don't have any people like that anymore.

[01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:29.380]
We don't have any of the regulars.

[01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:32.800]
We have chronic regulars that we don't want, but we don't have any regulars that we do want anymore.

[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:34.800]
That's all from those days gone by.

[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:36.580]
We used to be a lot of fun doing this.

[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:38.460]
Here's a mobile and curl cables.

[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:38.800]
Hello.

[01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:40.420]
Hi, Neil.

[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:41.040]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:42.660]
Yeah, coming about American Pie.

[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:44.600]
Hilary's movie.

[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:45.260]
Yeah.

[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:50.060]
He basically anything that could have happened to you when you were a young guy.

[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:51.200]
Anything embarrassing.

[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:53.460]
Pretty much happens to all of these guys in this movie.

[01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:53.660]
Right.

[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:55.480]
Getting caught by parents.

[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:58.240]
Making it with inanimate objects.

[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:00.800]
I mean, just...

[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:01.460]
It's Hilary.

[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:03.300]
I'm going to go see it tonight, I think.

[01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:04.380]
Hilary's movie.

[01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:06.160]
I mean, guy's getting embarrassed.

[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.020]
Just back and forth.

[01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:12.560]
There's a great scene with an internet clip that you love.

[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:16.120]
I don't even want to spoil it for you, but I must see you definitely.

[01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:16.680]
Okay.

[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:20.140]
I'm going to give you some good stuff, Browarth, and go and see it.

[01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:21.100]
Alrighty.

[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:21.640]
Thanks.

[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:22.280]
How are we going?

[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:24.880]
By the way, did we take our pool yet?

[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:27.780]
Is there anybody in this audience who actually would admit to liking that crap?

[01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:28.480]
What is the name of that?

[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:29.800]
I can't even think of the name of his artist again.

[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:30.420]
The Nookie guy.

[01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:32.400]
You want to...

[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:32.820]
That's okay.

[01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:34.140]
Get out of the way now.

[01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:35.860]
Yeah, Limp Biscuit.

[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:39.120]
I think the Limp Party's got that part of it right.

[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:40.740]
Limp as in lame.

[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:44.060]
I mean, it's the number one selling album in America.

[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:47.660]
The first week on the chart, replacing the backstreet boys,

[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:48.840]
who've been there for like four or five years.

[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:49.940]
Oh, that's why you're all bitter.

[01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:51.000]
No, I'm not bitter at all.

[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:53.180]
Oh, in other words, that's why I don't like the music.

[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:55.380]
I got news for you.

[01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:56.480]
Oh, you wouldn't like that.

[01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:56.920]
Fuck!

[01:44:57.820 --> 01:44:58.540]
That's crap!

[01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:02.300]
That's the worst thrill I've ever heard in my life.

[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:04.340]
I'd rather hear Puff Daddy than hear that.

[01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:06.420]
And I'd rather croak than hear Puff Daddy, okay?

[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:09.100]
Man.

[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:12.740]
That is just...

[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:19.280]
But anyway, like I said, you know, there's so many black people

[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:20.180]
who wish they were born white.

[01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:22.920]
And here we got all these white guys trying desperately to be black.

[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:24.420]
Just trying desperately.

[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:25.560]
And you know something that don't work.

[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:26.240]
They can't do it.

[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:27.100]
They cannot.

[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:28.360]
They do not be a being black.

[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:29.500]
Other than Eminem.

[01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:31.300]
The Beasties.

[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:34.180]
We're trying to think the Eminem may have a little black in him.

[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:36.060]
Kind of like Tom Green.

[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:37.020]
You think he's got a little in him?

[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:40.240]
26 past noon at 560WQAM.

[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:42.460]
Let's turn on MTV, okay?

[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:44.080]
We're going to go see American Pie.

[01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:45.120]
We'll go to a little number.

[01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:46.240]
I think they're a lot of here.

[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:47.040]
That's what I say.

[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:48.500]
All new kids out there.

[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:50.660]
Don't let your parents already ask all of Channel 10.

[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:51.380]
10 new kids.

[01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:52.660]
You can't go see American Pie.

[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:54.040]
Because it's rated R, okay?

[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:55.000]
As in ridiculous.

[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:57.820]
Just tell them F off and go them.

[01:45:57.940 --> 01:45:59.580]
See, it's just time to shag off, okay?

[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:04.140]
And thanks to Austin Powers, by the way, so much for it.

[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:05.800]
Because now all of a sudden we can say shag.

[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:06.760]
Isn't that great?

[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:07.980]
We can't say the F words.

[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:10.380]
But we can say shag, which means exactly the same thing.

[01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:12.040]
But in British, which is a foreign language.

[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:12.660]
So it's okay.

[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:15.920]
And if you don't believe me into foreign language, I'm virgin in the land.

[01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:18.120]
I can't understand a god damn thing those people are saying.

[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:19.760]
Can you just say that?

[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:21.800]
You need to speak in the hook of the other.

[01:46:22.140 --> 01:46:24.480]
What the hell are you speaking for Christ's sake?

[01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:28.380]
You god damn crazy brits.

[01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:29.480]
Give me the...

[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:31.900]
Yes, for sure.

[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:34.780]
Wow, honey, this is really good dinner.

[01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:35.440]
What is it?

[01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:35.880]
Dogguts.

[01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:36.840]
Dogguts?

[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:38.240]
Is that what I think it is?

[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:38.940]
I'm not sure.

[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:41.600]
You run out of ideas for a sit-down meal with the family?

[01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:43.680]
Well, head on down to your local dog pound.

[01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:46.940]
Make that grocery store and pick up dogguts.

[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:50.540]
They're pre-prepared with just the right amount of chedderon.

[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:52.340]
And are microwave ready.

[01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:54.200]
Ched scoop, nuke and boom.

[01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:55.440]
Dinner for the family.

[01:46:55.580 --> 01:46:58.740]
Daddy, can you pass me some more dogguts please?

[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:02.380]
Isn't just me or does anyone else think anything wrong with this?

[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:03.080]
Dogguts.

[01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:05.680]
The boy you think about it, the grocer they get.

[01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:07.380]
Find some for your family today.

[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:11.120]
From 31 to 560 WQM, we got 1,600 open lines now.

[01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:14.040]
And we got two calls in a more once-for-more land.

[01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:15.280]
We just had a call from Korea.

[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:16.140]
So we're doing great.

[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:17.680]
Everywhere outside of Dayton Browr.

[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:20.160]
But Dayton Browr not too good.

[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:24.460]
560-705-60, pound 560 on a mobile one line.

[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.440]
Mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:26.680]
Hello.

[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:27.740]
Yeah.

[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:28.280]
Yes, sir.

[01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:30.540]
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about the Browr.

[01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:37.500]
As a soldier in Germany in the 60s, I remember those Browr with the round roll.

[01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:38.060]
Yeah.

[01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:39.240]
And the mustard.

[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:39.760]
Right.

[01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:41.080]
I mean, they were really good.

[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:43.500]
But I've been looking for the meat since 1967.

[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:44.960]
I haven't been able to find it over here.

[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:47.180]
32 years in this guy still can't find the meat.

[01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:50.040]
I'm sorry. You're not going to find it anywhere.

[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:50.620]
Yeah, you're right.

[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:51.840]
As good as it was over there.

[01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:53.040]
I'll have to go back to Kaloan.

[01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:53.320]
You're right.

[01:47:54.340 --> 01:47:54.660]
Okay.

[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:55.560]
Okay, my way.

[01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:56.160]
I'm leaving right now.

[01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:56.680]
Thank you, sir.

[01:47:56.780 --> 01:47:57.240]
God bless you.

[01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:59.080]
32 years he's been searching for the meat.

[01:47:59.200 --> 01:47:59.440]
Okay.

[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:00.640]
I'll be in your relate to it.

[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:05.540]
5,670560, pound 560 on a mobile one line.

[01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:07.260]
Here's Orlando.

[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:07.720]
Hello.

[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:09.920]
Neil, what a breath of fresh air.

[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:14.920]
If those idiots themselves were to only knew what a God you are, they would be calling you in droves.

[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:16.080]
It's just good to hear your voice.

[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:16.860]
Yes, you're right.

[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:19.240]
They don't know a good thing when they, you know, they just spoil.

[01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:21.140]
I spoiled them rotten for over 20 years.

[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:21.840]
All right, believe it.

[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:25.660]
I moved away about a year and a half ago and I'm telling you, radio up here is like right wing

[01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:26.120]
rabble.

[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:27.800]
It is so pathetic.

[01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:32.780]
So I just want to say I wish that we could broadcast your show here and maybe I can get

[01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:36.600]
a pyro radio station and push it this far because it blows.

[01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:39.560]
Okay, sir.

[01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:40.220]
Have a great life.

[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:41.580]
Hey, Neil, can you come here and hold him?

[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:42.180]
For what?

[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:44.400]
Just so I can hear your voice for another five minutes.

[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:46.340]
I mean, I have no way to hear your show up here.

[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:47.300]
Can't do it, pal.

[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:48.480]
Oh, thanks a lot, Neil.

[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:48.900]
See you.

[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:51.020]
Can't do it.

[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:52.580]
This is a cheap outfit.

[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:55.620]
They're not going to put you on hold for five minutes all the way to Orlando when I, oh, that's

[01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:56.320]
right, was on his dime.

[01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:57.500]
What an idiot I am.

[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:00.200]
Now, we can't afford to tie up a line, pal.

[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:03.420]
We got all these call coming in here, like one and two at a time.

[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:08.160]
Five, six, seven, oh, five, 60, pound, five, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:09.280]
It's, I, I don't get it.

[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:10.220]
I don't understand it.

[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:15.140]
I've been in the course of fact that most of the people who live here got nothing to say.

[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:18.180]
You ever start talking to somebody in a supermarket or like anywhere?

[01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:19.620]
They got nothing to say.

[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:20.660]
Go to a ball game.

[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.520]
You ever try to talk to something like sitting behind you.

[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:26.580]
That has no idea of what's going on in the game, whatever the event might be, especially the hockey game.

[01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:28.940]
They're all sitting there going, yeah.

[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:30.520]
Talking about stuff.

[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:31.400]
Totally irrelevant.

[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:33.560]
They haven't got the foggiest idea of what's going on.

[01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:34.940]
But they're having a good time.

[01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:36.780]
And they're making damn sure that you're not.

[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:38.860]
Here's a mobile and Davie.

[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:39.100]
Hello.

[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:41.140]
How's it going, Neil?

[01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:41.780]
Great, sir.

[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:45.120]
You might have, if I call it, a couple of people, do you?

[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:45.980]
Yes, so, huh, I do.

[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:50.020]
Five, six, seven, oh, five, 60, pound, five, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:51.560]
I mine profusely, okay?

[01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:56.200]
I take the gravest exception to your calling somebody a douchebag, okay?

[01:49:56.420 --> 01:49:57.300]
You want to call an asshole?

[01:49:57.300 --> 01:49:58.140]
That's another story.

[01:49:58.400 --> 01:49:59.800]
But don't be calling people D.V.

[01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:03.760]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:04.100]
Hello.

[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:05.300]
Hello, Neil.

[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:05.800]
Yes, sir.

[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:08.780]
I'm a young voter in Dave County.

[01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:10.480]
And I'm just wondering, what is...

[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:11.540]
No, no, no.

[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:12.980]
Just that word keeps coming to mind.

[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:13.280]
No.

[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:13.680]
Go ahead.

[01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:15.300]
What do you think is the motive for...

[01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:17.920]
Why do you think panelists want this metro rail extension?

[01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:19.180]
What do you think is his reason?

[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:20.180]
Sir, let me ask you this.

[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:22.160]
What was the reason you think that he changed...

[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:25.280]
He did that sudden-dabbed face on that Mickey Ererson deal with that arena.

[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:29.020]
After we got elected, largely as part of the promise that he wasn't going to do the deal.

[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:30.780]
Perhaps you knew the people were building it.

[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:31.200]
Huh?

[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:33.220]
Perhaps you knew the bodies of the people building it.

[01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:33.680]
That's right.

[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:36.360]
Perhaps somebody's getting smeared somewhere along the way, okay?

[01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:40.280]
Because anywhere you've got a politician that this anxious to pull off this kind of a scam

[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:41.980]
and do it as transparently it is,

[01:50:42.060 --> 01:50:43.460]
reasonably as he is doing,

[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:45.780]
then there must be something more than meets the eye.

[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:47.180]
Do you see anything about it?

[01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:51.800]
Why is it that every time Merritt Steerheim comes back to be the manager, the county manager here,

[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:53.200]
we get more metro rail.

[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:56.860]
Even though the first one was a boondogger on a waste of a billion dollars,

[01:50:57.180 --> 01:50:59.140]
every time he comes back here, we get more of the same.

[01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:00.960]
Okay, thanks.

[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:01.320]

[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:03.120]
Oh, where are they putting them building this?

[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:04.880]
I'm building what to?

[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:05.920]
The metro extension.

[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:06.700]
What place are they?

[01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:08.540]
They name Mayor Penis's house and the herald.

[01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:09.940]
Okay, thanks a lot, Neil.

[01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:10.520]
Just remember.

[01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:10.880]
No.

[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:13.120]
Okay, you got it?

[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:13.940]
What's that word?

[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:14.300]
No.

[01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:14.980]
In English?

[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:15.260]
No.

[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:15.720]
Spanish?

[01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:16.060]
No.

[01:51:17.860 --> 01:51:18.660]
German 9.

[01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:19.720]
9.

[01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:21.640]
Just saying 9.

[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:22.980]
5, 6, 7, 05.

[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:24.180]
In fact, voting 9 times.

[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:26.640]
5.5, 60, animal, 1 line.

[01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:29.780]
Here's Halea.

[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:29.980]
Hello.

[01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:30.880]
Hey, Neil.

[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:31.400]
Yes, sir.

[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:32.360]
You doing great.

[01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:35.160]
Pen Dutch meat.

[01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:36.740]
They have a bratwurst.

[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:36.980]
Do they?

[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:37.860]
Yes, they do.

[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:39.880]
They do it real fresh.

[01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:42.440]
They don't have any of this MSG crap.

[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:46.460]
After a couple days, if you don't eat it in the fridge, it starts going bad.

[01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:48.080]
Because it's all real fresh.

[01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:49.040]
How do you write away, yeah?

[01:51:49.140 --> 01:51:49.420]
Oh, yeah.

[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:53.980]
And they also have the mustard, the pampti, something like that.

[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:55.440]
It's a deli-style mustard.

[01:51:56.540 --> 01:51:57.920]
Oh, that hymeric Himalor mustard, yeah.

[01:51:58.200 --> 01:51:59.360]
Something right from Germany.

[01:51:59.360 --> 01:51:59.820]
Yeah.

[01:52:00.620 --> 01:52:04.900]
It's awesome with the, and a little bit of firecrime.

[01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:07.420]
Now, you'll be 100% German.

[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:07.800]
Excellent.

[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:08.700]
God bless you, sir.

[01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:09.220]
Thank you.

[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:09.680]
Hey, wait.

[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:10.460]
One more thing.

[01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:11.060]
Take your time.

[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:13.320]
I'm probably the only color online, right?

[01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:13.920]
No, you're not.

[01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:14.460]
Okay.

[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:15.260]
The storyline is smoking.

[01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:16.160]
All righty.

[01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:16.940]
Smoking the good stuff.

[01:52:17.260 --> 01:52:17.440]
Great.

[01:52:18.020 --> 01:52:18.620]
Alex Penela.

[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:19.280]
No.

[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:20.340]
Come in mierda.

[01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:22.220]
Okay.

[01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:24.740]
He said full of crap is what he said.

[01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:28.640]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on a mobile one line.

[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:31.760]
Like I said, we can say shag and mierda, but we can't say,

[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:33.580]
and how do you like that?

[01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:36.420]
Because that's the American shagged way, baby.

[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:41.400]
Now, how come you got 16 questions on that one that says overtones?

[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:43.000]
See, those are the ones that get me curious.

[01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:44.660]
Here'd be overtones.

[01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:44.940]
Hello?

[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:46.000]
Neil.

[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:46.520]
Yes, sir.

[01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:47.280]
How you doing today?

[01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:47.720]
Okay.

[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:48.720]
Oh, I was just curious.

[01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:50.100]
I don't mean to be that that horse, bro.

[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:53.760]
If you saw the harrow, what happened in St. Louis when they blocked off the road there?

[01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:54.240]
Uh-huh.

[01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:54.900]
Oh, yeah.

[01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:57.740]
They arrested a whole bunch of people.

[01:52:57.740 --> 01:52:59.020]
Of course, they were dark, you understand.

[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:01.640]
Well, you know, depends on who's in power.

[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:02.100]
Right.

[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:06.260]
Another thing I just wanted to say, I think it was a great thing that they raised the tolls

[01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:10.120]
right before the selection, because now the people are nice and pissed off and fired up.

[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:11.880]
Good luck and getting it passed.

[01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:13.600]
No, I think you're wrong.

[01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:15.340]
I think that's the reason they did it.

[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:17.960]
What, to get them to make a pass it?

[01:53:18.220 --> 01:53:22.280]
The threatening that there's going to be 11 more toll roads if they don't pass the penny sales tax.

[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:24.560]
I'm voting no.

[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:24.980]
Okay.

[01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:26.820]
God bless you, sir, and vote early and often.

[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:27.020]
No.

[01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:28.020]
Just keep saying that.

[01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:29.140]
Keep going through your mind.

[01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:29.520]
Okay?

[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:29.960]
No.

[01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:30.540]
No.

[01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:31.140]
No.

[01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:32.260]
No.

[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:32.900]
No.

[01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:34.400]
Even him.

[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:39.720]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:42.420]
We got the award winning Henry Goldberg show at 2 o'clock today.

[01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:43.760]
Thanks for bringing in some no-dose.

[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:46.300]
While it's the middle of the summertime, what do you want?

[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:47.220]
There's nothing going on.

[01:53:47.540 --> 01:53:48.340]
All these idiots talking.

[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:50.000]
Football camp and all that crap.

[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:53.340]
And don't be playing anymore that phony theme, okay?

[01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:56.020]
That phony crap you were playing before.

[01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:56.980]
Yeah, that one.

[01:53:57.280 --> 01:53:58.100]
A little more, if you could.

[01:53:58.560 --> 01:53:59.360]
Get on there.

[01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:04.240]
And then at 6 o'clock we got Jim Mad Dog Manage.

[01:54:04.380 --> 01:54:04.600]
Yeah.

[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:08.920]
Till 745, he's going to be the four of the four play for the All Star games.

[01:54:09.060 --> 01:54:10.000]
And then we got the All Star games.

[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:11.540]
745, am I going to be watching?

[01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:11.800]
No.

[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:13.460]
No, I'm going to go see American Pie.

[01:54:14.860 --> 01:54:18.400]
I'm going to grab me a couple of stiff bratwursts and go see American Pie's what I'm going to do.

[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:21.500]
In fact, I understand in the movie that's generally all that's going on.

[01:54:21.780 --> 01:54:22.620]
That sounds like a good idea.

[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:23.280]
What?

[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:24.880]
Going to see that tonight.

[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:25.200]
Yeah.

[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:27.640]
And I think I got ID.

[01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:33.740]
I can probably pass for like 17, at least maybe 18.

[01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:37.180]
21, I keep, that's why I keep time.

[01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:39.160]
I'm holding up and they'll keep running like a son of a bitch.

[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:42.400]
21 before 1 at 5.60 because they keep saying, we're not...

[01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:43.360]
Okay.

[01:54:45.460 --> 01:54:47.040]
No matter how old they are, we're not.

[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:49.680]
Of course, your names do then.

[01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:50.920]
They have a different outlook on life.

[01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:54.040]
You can't go f**k yourself.

[01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:11.980]
You can't go f**k yourself.

[01:55:11.980 --> 01:55:13.460]
I got no 10 lines.

[01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:15.420]
I know that I am a hot.

[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:20.620]
I should tell you, you've got my battery boy shirt on.

[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:22.820]
And my song underneath.

[01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:25.700]
I'm looking so sweet.

[01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:29.400]
Yesterday I tried.

[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:34.380]
But Jenny's car broke down and so I lost my ride.

[01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:39.060]
But now the sun is shining and we are on our way.

[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:41.480]
Gonna stay all day.

[01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:44.500]
Gonna oil up with capricones.

[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:46.740]
On the sand real late.

[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:47.920]
At the beach.

[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:49.180]
All the summer.

[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:50.360]
It's too late now.

[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:51.740]
That's the warmer.

[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:53.000]
I'll be stunning.

[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:54.080]
I can't wait.

[01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:56.600]
My bikini looks real great.

[01:55:57.020 --> 01:55:59.020]
The guy say, I'm the one.

[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:00.420]
I am standing.

[01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:01.480]
I am flying.

[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:03.440]
Do you know I'm holding out.

[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:05.260]
And I'm at the other way.

[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:09.960]
He is a 45 for

[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:11.600]
a 45 for a 45 for a 50 for Ycame.

[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:15.140]
If he heard a brother named Dick.

[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:17.720]
Who will know, who will start his best at the group.

[01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:18.900]
Dick him.

[01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:20.900]
No, we will think.

[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:23.680]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5,

[01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:27.300]
5, 6, 7,

[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:29.780]
I think off, he is number one half for that.

[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:32.560]
And that's only one half.

[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:33.960]
We are going on, know what the commercial break.

[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:36.700]
and we had every line on the board lit up here and I go in with some false

[01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:40.660]
expectations and come back and like being being watching drop off like you

[01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:44.560]
know like swat mosquitoes at the goddamn ballpark. I understand that you're

[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:47.400]
very highly motivated and you've got no material but nevertheless it's

[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:54.140]
getting a little ridiculous. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, by the way, Joe Costello again comes

[01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:57.980]
in with another meat report. I guess I finally really found the topic that these

[01:56:57.980 --> 01:57:01.280]
people are into, okay? The search for the really good meat. I can relate to that.

[01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:06.680]
And one of Joe's friends who happened to be a meat inspector said definitely do

[01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:09.760]
not let Neil go to one of the places that's been mentioned. I don't want to

[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:13.860]
just say it on the ear, okay? He said the place was filthy and disgusting and you

[01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:18.360]
don't want to eat the meat from there. But I don't want to mention which place he

[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:24.380]
told me. Do I? Do you think? Could I give like a little clue to which place

[01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:29.580]
that it was? I better not. Okay, let's go to Miami. Hello?

[01:57:30.380 --> 01:57:31.980]
Hello, Neil? Yes?

[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:35.500]
Hey, Neil, what's going on? I want to cover some little things. Go ahead.

[01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:40.340]
George, did it. George did a great job while you were away. Excellent job as always.

[01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:43.400]
Everybody's ecstatic about the job. He did so good that he's going to be

[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:47.980]
starting again at one o'clock today. So I can go look for some good meat.

[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:51.560]
And what else? Oh, listen, I had a whole bag of

[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:55.620]
cassette tapes that I, you know, just a big bag of cassette tapes that I've

[01:57:55.620 --> 01:58:00.260]
accumulated over the years. And I went on a long trip. And so I said, let me

[01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:03.320]
grab the bag and listen to see what's on the cassettes to keep the ones I

[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:08.000]
wanted and throw away. I didn't. You'll never believe what I found. I have

[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:12.360]
found cassette tapes of you in on Zeta back in 1987.

[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:20.000]
Incredible. I don't believe it. You're still funny now as you were back then.

[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:23.860]
Yeah, I still don't know how. Even without the bird. The bird, when I listen,

[01:58:23.860 --> 01:58:26.740]
you know, I found the bird all right when I was listening to him back then.

[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:29.620]
But when I listened to him now, I'm like, what was he there for?

[01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:35.560]
He was there for free lunch. And about 50 grand a year, one 50 grand was

[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:39.440]
pretty good money. And it was basically you and the work bird were pretty

[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:43.240]
funny, but I would listen to the bird. I'm like, you and Captain Day were good.

[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:47.820]
The bird. I was like, what was he doing here? And specifically, I remember

[01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:53.840]
one day when you called Luke Alpin. Right. You remember that? Yeah. Oh,

[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:57.800]
myself taped when I would call you. And I'd be talking to me. I was still going to

[01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:00.700]
college. Yeah. I remember that we call Luke Alpin. I think I woke him up and he

[01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:04.000]
hated it. Yeah. He hated it. Like poison after that. Plus he became a born again.

[01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:09.220]
Not great day. They even providing fun and entertainment when you don't even

[01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:12.360]
know what you're doing. Exactly. And for the good old days, because you played

[01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:15.320]
Neil Waysney open the morning. Okay. They try to Neil have a great day. Bye.

[01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:19.420]
Yeah. Can't go back. Let's go back to Zeta. Let's go on FM where the real

[01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:22.080]
audience is. Okay. This place they won't promote that a lot of this show.

[01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:26.800]
Neil Waysney. Let's go on FM where the audience already is anyhow. I know the

[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:27.020]
usual.

[01:59:34.740 --> 01:59:35.620]
All right.

[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:16.640]
Yeah.

[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:21.840]
If you missed the Neil Rogers show yesterday on 610 WIOD, you missed

[02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:30.280]
this. Yeah. Okay. Listen, do me a favor, play anything because I can't stand listening

[02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:36.600]
to you. You start like a douchebag. Do I? Do I? What can I ask you a question before

[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:41.300]
you go? Oh God, you sound so stupid. I hate to talk to you. Yeah, go ahead. Why did

[02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:46.300]
you call me? I didn't call you. No, just to tell you not to say anything. Just play

[02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:52.160]
something. Oh God, can't stand it. Well then why are you listening? Ah, play something

[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:56.140]
already. Why won't you answer my? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, can't stand it. You won't

[02:00:56.140 --> 02:00:59.720]
see. He won't talk to me. Oh, we got a car. By the way, we never find out anymore

[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:04.220]
about his condition. We did not. I said the last said the better. Also, I look for the

[02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:08.540]
old bit for Andy. The Andy from the, which I used to, I don't want to say about my nickname

[02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:13.640]
once for Andy. That will be bad. Well, he's dead. Bad Andy? No, I used to calm the

[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:18.320]
whale. He was a whale of a guy. But anyway, I looked for the old bit in the newspapers I

[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:20.920]
didn't see. Now, you don't think that we could have been scammed on that, do you? By my

[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:24.540]
close personal friend Adam? That's too serious of a thing. Nobody would do that. And did

[02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:27.540]
that woman ever jump off the bridge yet or when you find out? Apparently it's still

[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:31.700]
going on. It's not going on. I'm holding on. I'm 595 and 441. She's still holding up the

[02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:35.660]
traffic and got it all blocked off. Well, what the hell am I going to do about that?

[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:38.900]
How the hell am I going to get home? I got another hour or two. I think about it, I guess

[02:01:38.900 --> 02:01:43.660]
that might be a good day to go sausage shopping. Jack, excellent idea. Go right up university

[02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:51.340]
there. Sounds good to me. So thanks for your free to my close friend, Jeff Hanson and

[02:01:51.340 --> 02:01:56.400]
Hollywood, whoever you are. It was an LA and after searching for years for copies of this,

[02:01:56.620 --> 02:02:02.340]
finally found two. One of what you bought for me. Thank you, Jeff.

[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:13.060]
Jeff, the ThunderClaft Newman, something near. Well, I've been looking for this for it.

[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:17.560]
Never had it, I had the record. Never had it before on CD. Got it now. Nobody's getting

[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:23.040]
that out of my hands. Can I borrow it? No. You can borrow what's his name? No, Limp

[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:29.060]
Dick. I got my own copy thing. Got your own Limp Dick biscuit. Here's a call from DC.

[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:34.700]
Hello? Hey, man. Yes, sir. Listen to you on the net. I'll ride. I'm originally from

[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:41.580]
Miami living up here now. And how do you like it? It's pretty nice. I'm in the technology

[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:46.560]
and stuff like this is like Santa's a junior up here. Is it? Yeah. It's pretty neat.

[02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:51.180]
A lot of starches up there though, aren't there? I don't know where I am. I'm out near

[02:02:51.180 --> 02:03:01.440]
a duller airport. No, I see. You know, you know who's on from they have 11 to 3, something

[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:06.000]
like that 11 to 4 up here. You know, you know, the four or something like that. You know,

[02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:12.520]
the midday show. Yeah. After Howard is G Gordon Litty. Yes, that grade. You know, I

[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:19.660]
as much as I've got. He I'd rather listen to him. I swear to God 10 times over and I don't

[02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:26.920]
like listening to him, but he's he's not to. Yeah. I'd rather listen to him than rush.

[02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:30.740]
But you know what people call him up and just ask him questions like they say, hey, I'm

[02:03:30.740 --> 02:03:34.740]
getting married in two weeks. What should I do? G Gordon Litty. Yes. It's that weird

[02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:39.500]
as saying to hear people calling him and asking him advice that they would ask in landers.

[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:43.760]
Uh huh. It's amazing. I just did a B and E and what should I do and how do I get off

[02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:51.160]
with it? Yeah. Yeah. So it's yeah. I just ate a rat. You even had some net congestion

[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:55.860]
on your on your download when I listen to you. I had some net congestion. That's how many

[02:03:55.860 --> 02:03:59.680]
people are listening to this all over the world. You're damn right, man. Yeah. And that

[02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:02.560]
asshole, I'm saying Lewis, they call me that. Yeah. But he's listening right now. He's

[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:07.200]
got his ear glued to it. He's squeezing it right now. He's so excited. Yeah. Well, my

[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:13.060]
brother, Vic, he's a dishbag. Okay. He's listening or not. But nice to hear you. Okay.

[02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:16.160]
Thanks for the good news. Have a great life. Thanks. Thanks. Now, what are you holding?

[02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:19.400]
Oh, my good friend Bob Soap was on there. I was just thinking about Bob Soap for this

[02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:22.260]
morning probably because I was watching you the weather on Channel 4. How you doing, Bob?

[02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:27.100]
Good morning. You'll welcome back and happy birthday again. Oh, again. Come on. I

[02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:31.440]
mean, I was a happy birthday the day that it was, but I was going on vacation. I wanted

[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:34.820]
to make sure that they got back to you. All right. Okay. I just want to let you know

[02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:39.860]
that that woman. Uh, she apparently her last game was to put both legs over the side

[02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:44.780]
and lean forward and the police picked up behind her and grabbed her. Oh, damn it. I hate

[02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:49.440]
when that happens. Well, some people were said, push her, push her. Yeah. That's what I

[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:54.840]
was going on. Stuck in traffic. Right. Now, it's over. So good news for you going home

[02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:59.580]
today. So we got, we got the, uh, the railway mass murder. They caught him today and we

[02:04:59.580 --> 02:05:04.520]
got the, uh, the crazy woman off 595. Yeah. It's a banner year. What more could you want?

[02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:10.520]
Thanks a lot, Bob. All right. I'll be seeing. There's Bob Soap or one of the good guys on

[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:15.280]
channel four. There are any other good guys on there? No. Just him. Well, what just happened

[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:19.220]
there? See, I don't understand you people today. Man, we get 600 lines all lit up here.

[02:05:19.300 --> 02:05:22.340]
And I think we're making a little bit of progress. We're getting calls from DC. We're getting

[02:05:22.340 --> 02:05:26.640]
calls from Korea. We're getting calls from Team Mussolani. We're getting calls from all

[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:29.520]
over the world. And then all of a sudden, Plink Plink, Plink. It's like Plink alone.

[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:35.220]
The goddamn price is right. And you wonder why get a little bit paranoid about this whole

[02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:39.480]
phone thing we got here about our friend's ear at the phone company. You people at the

[02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:47.600]
phone company suck. You got it. Oh, by the way, this is G Gordon Litty and they don't

[02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:55.100]
come any worse than Neil Rogers 5 670 560 pound 560 on the mobile one line. Here's a mobile

[02:05:55.100 --> 02:06:04.240]
in Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. I got the info on the box. Okay. Usengers in Milwaukee.

[02:06:05.020 --> 02:06:09.020]
It's truly a Schmeck group. Yeah, but where do you get them here?

[02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:15.000]
I'm sure one is pretty good. Not as good, but if you got a few bucks to mail out, it's

[02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:19.080]
the real thing. Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot. I think what I'm going to do next time I go

[02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:23.060]
to Germany, I'm going to smuggle in $19,000 worth of Browse. If it's good enough for

[02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:27.760]
the governor's wife, I guess I can do it too. If it's good enough for Columbus, or you

[02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:34.240]
can hide it. Maybe in Columbus, rectum probably wouldn't be the first meat that's been in

[02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:46.460]
there. 5 670 560 pound 561, but that's a sin. Yeah. Well, maybe she can atone for it at

[02:06:46.460 --> 02:06:49.980]
a later date, just like the sin of smuggling all that crap that she bought from gay paris.

[02:06:49.980 --> 02:06:54.080]
That was probably a sin too. Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello.

[02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:59.680]
Oh, Camino. Yes, sir. I have the answer to your Browse problem. Okay.

[02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:06.040]
Old island bed of rest on Spirit 84. Yeah, somebody faxed me that before, but that's a long,

[02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:11.140]
long way from me. We got a butcher shop in there that there were still the greatest man.

[02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:16.060]
Yeah. Might be worth the ride for it. The worst are the best. The worst are the best.

[02:07:16.060 --> 02:07:20.320]
Okay. That would be a good advertising campaign, by the way. I'll take only 10%. All right.

[02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:23.740]
Thanks a lot, Pampy. I'm going to go over there. I think that's a good idea. In fact, I'll

[02:07:23.740 --> 02:07:28.160]
just go over there and have dinner one night and then stop after dinner in the sausage shop

[02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:31.340]
and buy a whole bunch of crap and take it home. Sounds real good to me. Thank you, sir.

[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:34.560]
God bless you. That's a good place by the way, at least it used to be years ago. About

[02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:37.620]
a hundred years ago when I ate in there last time, the old Heidelberg on St. Louis 84,

[02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:41.540]
which you didn't know. Don't know. In fact, it's right on the way to Ruth's Chris. That's

[02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:45.720]
a good idea. Next time I get inspired to go over to Ruth's Chris, if that should ever

[02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:51.500]
happen again, after the kind of indifferent treatment that I had last time I went. But

[02:07:51.500 --> 02:07:54.220]
if I do decide to go again, what I'll do is stop over there with you on the Heidelberg

[02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:57.120]
in the market. I'll pick up a bunch of bratwurst. I'll walk into Ruth's Chris and say,

[02:07:57.260 --> 02:08:02.620]
hey, you want to heat these up for us, please? And we'll just drink some water. Okay. Thank

[02:08:02.620 --> 02:08:06.560]
you. And we'll take a few of these mints on the way out. They do have good mints. You

[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:09.220]
notice that? On the way out? Mm. Killer.

[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:46.780]
Okay. That's a full question today. Who's got the better and Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears

[02:09:46.780 --> 02:09:53.540]
or Olympic Viscuit? Is our full question today? 5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T

[02:09:53.540 --> 02:09:56.540]
wireless line. We're going to make a long story short. Can any of the three of them sing

[02:09:56.540 --> 02:10:01.420]
whatsoever? No. No. But be that as it may. I'll tell you another group that I would mention

[02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:03.820]
this to you before when you were like non-committal because you don't know who they are.

[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:07.220]
Five and another one of those boy groups and another one of those rip off groups. Five

[02:10:07.220 --> 02:10:10.280]
and another new song is like a rap song which they can't sing. It doesn't make any

[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:13.420]
difference whether they're rapid or crapid because they can't sing worth a crap anyway.

[02:10:15.540 --> 02:10:19.940]
Five. Is it on the scale of 500? That's about where their music level is. And all about

[02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:24.520]
that whole group. Five, I would say on a scale of 2000. Just thought of a mention on

[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:28.720]
TRL backstreet boys, seven nights in a row back to number one. How come that girl from

[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:32.160]
Gainesville by the way that N. Sync bitch? How come that nice to a young lady never

[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:38.160]
called us back from Florida from F.U. How come she never called us back? She was going

[02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:41.140]
back to summer school or something like that and giving me a big song and an answer that

[02:10:41.140 --> 02:10:45.160]
I told her that the backstreet boys would be number one. This is like ages ago and sure

[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:50.900]
enough by the end of that week there was the planting N. Sync which sucks. And it's still

[02:10:50.900 --> 02:10:54.380]
there. Number one again last night on TRL since now that we're all watching the Tom Green

[02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:58.860]
show watching MTV 24 hours a day and turning off these other goddamn channels. That's

[02:10:58.860 --> 02:11:04.680]
what I say. Turn off all the other crap. Turn on MTV and leave it on. Especially Thursday

[02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:08.960]
nights at 10 30 and Sunday afternoon at 3 or 4 whatever they decide to put on two Tom Green

[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:15.020]
shows back to back. Here's plantation. Hello. Plantation.

[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:19.460]
Neil how you doing? Pretty good sir. All right. Yeah I had two things I wanted to talk

[02:11:19.460 --> 02:11:24.700]
to you about. I heard you mentioned about the American Pie movie. Right. You got to

[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:28.780]
see this movie. It's the funniest thing in the world. And the great thing about it is

[02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:34.680]
that I'm 19 I just graduated from high school last month and it doesn't crap around about

[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:40.120]
what's really going on in high school. You know like sex is so easy to come by. Right.

[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:45.360]
It's not. You know. All right trust me unless you're one of these big dumb chucks who throw

[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:49.180]
a football or put a ball through a hoop. You know it's not that easy to come by. It's

[02:11:49.180 --> 02:11:52.780]
really a real guy. I'll go see it. It's very fun. I'm going to go see it tonight.

[02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:57.540]
All right. The other thing I want to talk to you about was you know I traveled throughout

[02:11:57.540 --> 02:12:01.700]
you know United States. I went to you were a blast year with my family and everything.

[02:12:02.300 --> 02:12:09.340]
And I've never seen any other state or country. Pander to an ethnic group like the Florida

[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:14.580]
government. Right. Pander to these Cubans. That's absolutely correct. You know. You just

[02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:18.900]
do whatever the hell they want and get away with it. Most people would be in jail if

[02:12:18.900 --> 02:12:22.200]
they're blocking traffic. You know sitting jail right now. Like they were like they weren't

[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:25.680]
saying Lewis over the weekend. I tried pulling that crap there and a couple hundred of them

[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:29.260]
went to jail. That's right being tormented by bubbling your jail cells but not the Cubans

[02:12:29.260 --> 02:12:33.480]
down here. Not them. Well we got a foreign country you know. Dave County has been taken

[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:39.820]
over and that's why most of us. United States you know this man makes up what maybe 4%

[02:12:39.820 --> 02:12:46.320]
of the voting population. Okay. And there's an article in the. Yeah but Dave County they

[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:50.420]
make a probably 94% of the voting population. Yeah. The old Cubans are the only ones that

[02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:55.420]
vote in big county. You know I don't know what the validity behind this article in the

[02:12:55.420 --> 02:13:00.800]
sunset was a couple of weeks ago. They said that out goal was actually going to ask Mayor

[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:05.880]
Penga to be his running mate in 2000. Yeah they're talking about it. I mean what I say

[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:09.560]
I say well Pacima maybe an O-Chaf that's the way we have to get him out of here. I say

[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:13.840]
let's do it. And I'm thinking myself go right ahead and I'll go out and I'll vote for

[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:22.980]
George Bush and his ugly plus two. Right. Okay. Yeah. Let's I say the way let's just

[02:13:22.980 --> 02:13:27.300]
right we'll do right ends. We'll have Tom Green. This is the choice is Tom Green. Jesse

[02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:33.240]
the body Ventura. That's a good start. No more these goddamn politicians. They're all

[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:36.400]
the same. They're all a bunch of crooks baby. If not just at least Shane they're all a

[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:41.640]
bunch of crooks. They're all on a take. They're a pile of crap. The only guy that isn't

[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:44.860]
a crook is goddamn Ted Kennedy because he's got all the money and plus he's already

[02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:49.960]
killed one woman and done all the crap that he can do. Okay. We love old Ted Kennedy.

[02:13:50.100 --> 02:13:52.920]
Boys he looking old by the way. Do you see him on there with Bubba this morning? They're

[02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:58.400]
doing this healthcare thing. Wow. That fast living Teddy it's going to get to you as

[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:04.460]
soon or later and he also is what does he weigh about 240 to 80 hundred and three 40. He

[02:14:04.460 --> 02:14:10.180]
looks like fat boy in a bad day. So did we ever get any more see I'm looking for the

[02:14:10.180 --> 02:14:13.720]
old bid on my good close friend Andy. Didn't see any old bid on that. Maybe that was I don't

[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:17.920]
know. Maybe it was just the hoax. I'm hoping for the best. I'm hoping that I was just

[02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:23.300]
Ted. I would rather. I'd rather that's kind of notes saying we just you know played

[02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:26.880]
little prank on you and Andy's doing fine. Somebody would have called to say it was a

[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:33.700]
hoax by now. He's not alive. He's not coming back. He won't be at that first hockey game

[02:14:33.700 --> 02:14:40.980]
this fall. Come on. No. Please tell me he'll be there. He died. Just say he'll be there.

[02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:48.360]
He won't be there. Here's dear field. Hello. Hello. Neil. Yes sir. A couple things I haven't

[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:51.520]
talked to you. Welcome back number one. Thank you so much. It's so great to be back.

[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:56.200]
Yeah. I can imagine. I'm doing okay. Hey. You got me Jones and I was over in

[02:14:56.200 --> 02:15:00.480]
Cologne during many couple years back and all God those thoughts that you're right. You

[02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:04.400]
have the best thought worst in the city at least the ones that I had right at the train

[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:09.160]
station. Really? Yes. Oh God. I just in the train station. They got a whole bunch of

[02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:13.020]
little shops there. You know, little food shops and so on. And there were I you know,

[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:17.240]
I tried a couple different places and there was one that was just sensational. Some of

[02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:21.840]
them are a little bit too greasy. Oh, this one was just fantastic. But it was truly amazing.

[02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:25.320]
You'd walk along these little shops and little they'd have a little grill outside like

[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:28.880]
a hibachi. Right. And then you would just smell that and you'd go in there for a snack

[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:33.400]
and a little bit later. When were you there? This was a few years ago and I was in the

[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:37.220]
summer time. I've never been in a city in my life where there were more beautiful people

[02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:41.260]
than the people in Cologne Germany. You could just sit. They had that one big shopping

[02:15:41.260 --> 02:15:45.640]
mall street. It's called Hohe Hohe Hohe. Okay. And it's like a close shopping mall.

[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:50.020]
There's very richy, you know, expensive shops in there of all kinds. And you just could

[02:15:50.020 --> 02:15:53.500]
sit there and people watch all day and just with your tongue down to your toenails, it's

[02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:58.180]
unbelievable. Seriously. You've fit in like a glove over there. I've met them. Yes. Okay.

[02:15:58.180 --> 02:16:02.700]
That's one thing I was going to talk to you about. Another thing was that I had, I just

[02:16:02.700 --> 02:16:07.420]
I'm disgusted with all the way they're allowing the Cubans to block the streets. And I've

[02:16:07.420 --> 02:16:11.620]
just never seen like they can have a protest that they want, but blocking the lives of people

[02:16:11.620 --> 02:16:15.620]
and indeed. That's what I said. If you want to have a protest at the appropriate place

[02:16:15.620 --> 02:16:20.180]
in front of a building somewhere, but nothing go out there and mess up people's lives and

[02:16:20.180 --> 02:16:24.520]
screw up the whole roadways for Christ's. Absolutely unacceptable. And they should be ashamed

[02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:28.340]
because we rolled out the red carpet to help them. Yeah. Look what they're doing to us.

[02:16:28.340 --> 02:16:32.000]
Exactly. Spitting in our push. That's right. And in closing, I'm doing it out loud too.

[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:37.760]
In closing, from my friend's remain that's healing up in Boka, shameless request. Nobody

[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:42.440]
rips you back. Okay. Thanks. Have a great day. Okay. It's nine minutes after one at

[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:46.200]
five sixty WQM. We're solving all the problems of the world here today. Like two o'clock.

[02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:48.940]
Then we're going to go out and get some real good bratwirt. Smoke a little weed and

[02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:53.340]
then go see a merc in pie tonight. That's good to me. Now that 19 year old young man called

[02:16:53.340 --> 02:16:56.360]
a couple of calls ago to say it's not all at least easy to get laid in the high school.

[02:16:56.660 --> 02:16:59.520]
How do you like that? She there was that big article they had the other. She yesterday

[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:03.240]
in the paper about the brownered kids and about there's not as much sex to not as

[02:17:03.240 --> 02:17:06.860]
made sex with active. That's not by choice. It's just they can't get as much as they used to.

[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:13.340]
Not by choice. Okay. Because believe me, trust me when I tell you okay. The one thing that

[02:17:13.340 --> 02:17:18.080]
they would tell you. I wanted it. You bet. They would tell you that. That doesn't necessarily

[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:21.100]
mean you're going to get it. I wanted it. Yeah. I kept hearing that. By the way, we're

[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:26.000]
going to see him again or not. Huh? I guess we won't see him no more. JC? No, not him.

[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:30.160]
When you had the first initial right. Oh, the other one. The other one. The other CT. Yeah.

[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:35.060]
No, I don't know. Probably not. I've seen him around. You've seen him around where? Around here

[02:17:35.060 --> 02:17:42.800]
like in the afternoon. Long after you've gone home. Oh, he's playing hard to get. He didn't

[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:48.920]
make it worth his while. I guess. Well, guess what? I did a lot better over there. Didn't cost

[02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:55.120]
me a dime. Just like always. A lot better. I mean no problem. No conversation. No big song

[02:17:55.120 --> 02:18:02.000]
in a dance. No games. No a tease. No, you know, no hairy chest. No, oh, no musk right chest.

[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:04.980]
That was only on the plane. That was only Austin Powers on the Virgin Atlantic plane.

[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:14.620]
By the time I get through the next couple of minutes, she is going to have to pick every scab off

[02:18:14.620 --> 02:18:20.680]
that cuter. It's a spilled body of hers. All right. No, but you risk your better.

[02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:27.640]
So I'm going crazy on this. Yes, because this has got to stop. You make me sick, Pat. You bitch.

[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:35.680]
God. How is it possible to be so stupid, Pat? No, but you miss you. And I thought could I

[02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:45.980]
do it? You asshole. You. Baby. Well, sing this. You fat slob. I'm going to take this court.

[02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:50.720]
And I'm going to shove it right up his ass. Okay. And I'm going to shove this thing so far up his butt

[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:54.460]
that he's going to be singing a different tune when I get through with him. Only have a longer

[02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:58.560]
court than this piece of crap. Look at this. Look how short this damn thing is. You got a hundred

[02:18:58.560 --> 02:19:02.860]
assholes running around this building. They can find another one beside him, although maybe not that big.

[02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:07.300]
Oh, get it out of there. Go pull it towards somewhere. Go do something.

[02:19:07.940 --> 02:19:11.220]
Pull what? In your case, a good question. Okay. God.

[02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:19.640]
Don't start looking once again as always to blame fat old Neil for whatever you're upset about.

[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:22.620]
You're disgusting, nauseating old swans.

[02:19:28.860 --> 02:19:30.620]
Old, crappy old bitches.

[02:19:30.620 --> 02:19:33.380]
Neil, if you don't repent, you're going to spit hell. Why does your

[02:19:33.380 --> 02:19:36.260]
fucking shit? You're going to spit a white open. You're going to spit a white open.

[02:19:36.400 --> 02:19:38.420]
You're going to spit a gold with a mallet. You're going to spit all bitch.

[02:19:39.220 --> 02:19:41.160]
There we go. Now we're cooking.

[02:19:45.380 --> 02:19:50.360]
What did I just get through talking about with old bags? We don't want you, Lenny. Okay.

[02:19:50.420 --> 02:19:53.220]
Go get some knitting out. Go find some crosswood puzzle.

[02:19:54.180 --> 02:19:58.560]
Okay. Well, send us Ramirez. The railway killer. The mass murder. The serial killer

[02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:02.980]
is been captured in case you missed it. And the Bob Silver reports that they got that lady off

[02:20:02.980 --> 02:20:08.520]
the 595 overpassed here by 441. What else? What more could you want? Here's a,

[02:20:08.580 --> 02:20:11.680]
boy, you ought to read this. I don't have time to read it on the ear. This poor bastard was coming

[02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:16.720]
back on continental from Vegas through Houston. And what he went through, I mean, I couldn't,

[02:20:16.740 --> 02:20:21.000]
oh, geez, I'm ready to blow my brains out and it wasn't even my trip. Sorry about that, Ed.

[02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:28.480]
One of our listeners out there who made the bad bad mistake of flying continental airlines. Bad

[02:20:28.480 --> 02:20:31.180]
good friend who come into the hockey games all the time. The airline pilot said,

[02:20:31.260 --> 02:20:34.980]
blah, blah, blah. Yeah, he's a good guy, but he talks a lot. He works for continental. So I

[02:20:34.980 --> 02:20:40.800]
shouldn't have said that, but 56670560. Hey, listen, I tell it the way it is. Okay. I'm not going

[02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:45.980]
to lie for anybody unless I get a lot of money for it, which I don't. And even for these people here,

[02:20:46.060 --> 02:20:52.680]
am I, they pay me enough to lie for this joint? No way. Boy, do they suck. 56670560.560

[02:20:52.680 --> 02:20:56.880]
on the ATT wireless line. Yeah, I'm debating, you know, on the way home where I should stop for

[02:20:56.880 --> 02:21:00.340]
a broadcast or maybe like, I don't know, but Anna split a basket robin. So I'm good.

[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:05.480]
You know, the basket robins that drive through one on 163rd in North Aiden. What?

[02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:09.340]
Don't do it. No, I don't mean a banana split. I'm just talking about like a hot punch

[02:21:09.340 --> 02:21:13.860]
Sunday with nuts who have cream and cherries on. They taste the thing. They all bring

[02:21:13.860 --> 02:21:17.880]
have you. You know, business thing. You mean like the one I had about three weeks ago?

[02:21:18.120 --> 02:21:20.760]
It'll be no better than that one. Oh, then it ought to be great.

[02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:26.060]
That's a good place. Basket Robbins drive through. It's like heaven.

[02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:31.380]
And the best part of it is it's only like a few blocks off the interchange there at 163rd.

[02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:35.120]
So you can drive from there like 30 seconds right on the turn pike and you'll hold the

[02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:38.800]
Sunday like in one hand while you're paying the tool. How do you like that? All you ask

[02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:42.200]
holes you win competence that can't pay your 50 cent toll in Dave County.

[02:21:42.640 --> 02:21:47.080]
I can drive through the turn pike tool thing there at the Golden Glades,

[02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:52.300]
eating a hot punch Sunday for basket robin. Pay my 75 cents. No problem at all. And zip right

[02:21:52.300 --> 02:21:57.040]
up the old Hershey highway back to the Broward. No problem at all. An old fart like me. An old

[02:21:57.040 --> 02:22:01.600]
funny dirty bag like me. I can do that. And you people out there are sitting around fumbling

[02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:06.920]
forward, fumbling forward in a goddamn change too. Shame on you. I think there are a bunch of

[02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:10.100]
actors out there. I think that's what he brought ringers in here. You know, most of the people

[02:22:10.100 --> 02:22:14.600]
are out of town right now. It's the middle of July. I think the mayor imported a bunch of ringers

[02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:18.040]
here. In fact, maybe all those illegal alien Cubans, they put them all in the car and they're the

[02:22:18.040 --> 02:22:21.860]
ones that are playing all this baby crap out the tool booths pretending the traffic's all backed up.

[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:27.680]
Roddy, a mayor, mayor, pingo. You're not fooling anybody. You piece of turd straight to jail.

[02:22:30.100 --> 02:22:31.300]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Huh?

[02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:38.600]
Fort Lauderdale. Yeah. Yes, sir. Do me a favor. Do not go to Penn Dutch. Yeah.

[02:22:38.720 --> 02:22:43.840]
There's a place in Lauderdale. It's just north of commercial and federal highways called Emily's.

[02:22:44.120 --> 02:22:48.980]
Yeah. The world's best. All they do is make homemade sausage. Really? Yep. You walk in. It's a mama

[02:22:48.980 --> 02:22:56.440]
pop operation. Emily knows her meat. Oh, it's it's just ungually. It's the best. Without a doubt. Do not go to

[02:22:56.440 --> 02:23:02.440]
Penn Dutch. I'm curious. Once you go there, you'll freak out. Okay. All right. I'll go see Emily.

[02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:06.620]
All right. Thanks. Yeah. In fact, that's the second person today that said do not go to

[02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:14.000]
someplace. 567.0560.050.560 on the AT&T wireless line. That's where it's at, baby. Hank Goldberg's

[02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:18.400]
coming up at two o'clock today to cover all the heavy duty sports news. Then about two-fifteen who

[02:23:18.400 --> 02:23:22.640]
get into some really good stuff. Well, there's nothing going on in sports. Okay. What can I tell you?

[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:26.400]
It's just a really dead time. The all-star game tonight. Does anybody care about that? We got

[02:23:27.300 --> 02:23:31.080]
655 teams. You do realize, by the way, that teams like the Marlins that have been out of the

[02:23:31.080 --> 02:23:35.300]
race for like what? For about two and a half months now that they still got 70 some out almost 80

[02:23:35.300 --> 02:23:41.020]
games to go. You do realize that, don't you? Uh-huh. And like John Henry says, we stink. We don't

[02:23:41.020 --> 02:23:44.600]
expect anybody to show up. The team for at least a couple of years is going to be really grotesque

[02:23:44.600 --> 02:23:49.120]
where to lose our ass. So why would you want to go? Why would any person in its right mind go

[02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:52.840]
and they tell you ahead of time? Like I said at the beginning of the show today. It's like somebody

[02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:57.200]
standing on the front of his restaurant saying, the meat all spoiled. Okay. Our freezer unit went

[02:23:57.200 --> 02:24:01.400]
out during the night. All of our meat is rotten. You're going to get some horrendous disease. And

[02:24:01.740 --> 02:24:05.700]
everything we got in there is spoiled. It's going to taste like crap. We can't afford to lower the

[02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:09.700]
prices. So we're going to gouge you like crazy. But if you want to come in and all men, people are

[02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:16.100]
coming in. That's what it would be like. I don't understand these people. Talk about lifeless

[02:24:16.100 --> 02:24:20.760]
and coolest. Oh yeah. Well, we got to take our kids to a ballgame. Take them out to see American

[02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:25.040]
pie tonight instead. Okay. Take your five and ten and twelve year old kid to go see a really

[02:24:25.040 --> 02:24:30.580]
funny movie. Take him to go see Austin Powers. Take him to go see a soft park.

[02:24:32.540 --> 02:24:37.600]
Here's a mobile and Cooper city. Hello. Uh-huh Neil. Yes sir. I just saw Mayor Ping the handing

[02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:41.960]
out pace. I was found in Miami. Those pace those won't sit in those machines. They'll fit in his

[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:48.260]
back home. And as far as ten Dutch you can put me down as the third guy to say forget it. But

[02:24:48.260 --> 02:24:53.140]
yeah, there is a place called International Homemade Sausage in Combo Pines. Yeah, ahead about the

[02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:58.620]
18 calls in it. That's the place to go. All these people are giving you places. That's that's out

[02:24:58.620 --> 02:25:02.840]
in your neck of the world. That's the one on university. It's on university just north of

[02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:07.360]
Chantin Street on the west side. It's right. The hole in the wall place. Uh-uh. A Polish guy's been

[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:12.660]
there. He's been making them for years. Did you hear- did you hear the interview this morning with

[02:25:12.660 --> 02:25:17.940]
Jimmy Johnson on the worst team? No. He was, uh, you know, there was a lot of suction going on. I

[02:25:17.940 --> 02:25:22.860]
had a lot of CDs playing in my, uh, player in the car. Uh, I wish I had a few more. But he was, uh,

[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:27.860]
the Tony Martin issue came up and, uh, and, and, and, you know, how he would be a great player if he

[02:25:27.860 --> 02:25:32.860]
stayed out of jail and Jimmy said, well, Tony didn't have anything to do with the drug dealing

[02:25:32.860 --> 02:25:36.820]
end of it. So he's okay. So I guess you can be a money laundering player with the, uh, play with

[02:25:36.820 --> 02:25:40.100]
the doll. But you just can't, you just can't deal drugs. Yeah, he would just be in a China. I mean,

[02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:44.060]
you know, he was just doing a laundry number. Right. That's right. And the, Neil and closing

[02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:49.440]
pool pod don't give me anymore work. I'm shfitting out here. Okay. Thank you. He shfits it over there.

[02:25:49.720 --> 02:25:53.340]
Yeah, Tony Martin. You don't look good Chinese, but nevertheless, maybe it's turning Japanese.

[02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:59.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the 18. We haven't had one call to the about Limpic. Uh, what's his name?

[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:09.740]
What is his name? Biscuit. Oh, biscuit. A test get a biscuit. Kill that biscuit. Oh, man.

[02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:18.560]
That is so lame. All I can say about that song is. Yeah. Yeah. And that's the only reason that song

[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:21.700]
is popular because they just keep saying stick it up your ass over and over again. You know,

[02:26:21.700 --> 02:26:25.880]
and there's certain songs like that. Well, they say no key a lot. And there's one song which,

[02:26:26.020 --> 02:26:29.340]
uh, some rapper, which is very big in Europe, which is just making it. They were talking about

[02:26:29.340 --> 02:26:33.240]
having it on MTV. And I have no idea how they're going to bleep it out because he keeps saying,

[02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:38.680]
F. And it sounds like he's saying F. I. U. Which I've got nothing to do with here. But he's saying F.

[02:26:38.740 --> 02:26:44.860]
F. I. U. Over and over again. What is that? Is he like at the world, maybe? No. F. I. U. He's saying.

[02:26:45.060 --> 02:26:50.020]
Maybe it's from U. M. Uh-huh. That might be it. F. I. U. Probably sour about some damn volleyball game.

[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:56.900]
Here's Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing? Great. I just called in when you played the

[02:26:56.900 --> 02:27:02.780]
bit about Jennifer Lopez. Yes, sir. I just want to say that ever since she became more appealing to

[02:27:02.780 --> 02:27:07.840]
both white and black audiences. It looks like she's getting, she's losing weight, man. In the beginning,

[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:13.160]
she was bigger, man. Her butt was big. But now she's got a skinny and she got a scrawny bud. She's

[02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:18.260]
got, she's got to get skinny so she can cross over to both. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. But she'll

[02:27:18.260 --> 02:27:22.640]
wind up losing that Puerto Rican constituency. They like the big bud. Well, see, I like, yeah, she

[02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:26.800]
gonna lose me because I'm black. She's all the land. The Latin guys that you gotta have a big bud.

[02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:30.860]
I gotta have it. I'm black. I gotta have it. She's, she's out of the picture now, man. Yeah.

[02:27:31.180 --> 02:27:36.680]
Now what about Britney Spears? Uh-uh. No, that's not me either. Black guys aren't into Britney.

[02:27:36.980 --> 02:27:41.680]
We're not into Britney, man. Yeah. We're not into Britney. But it's, but I mean, you can keep playing a bit,

[02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:47.400]
but it's, it's she's lost it. She's, she's history. She did me. Yeah. Okay. All right, man. Thanks for

[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:52.680]
the good news. There's a bulletin from the bro. Okay. He say she's dead. He be dead. I don't know.

[02:27:52.700 --> 02:27:56.980]
I've seen her butt lately. It's uh, plenty ample. No, you haven't seen her but you keep seeing the

[02:27:56.980 --> 02:28:01.100]
same video over. No, no, not the video. She was doing something on the beach. She was wearing a

[02:28:01.100 --> 02:28:05.180]
bikini. I'm gonna say to you the same thing I said yesterday. And again, I have magnificent taste.

[02:28:05.460 --> 02:28:09.040]
And that is that from the neck off she needs serious help. She ain't nothing. Oh, I agree.

[02:28:10.260 --> 02:28:14.580]
From the hell we were talking about her butt. Well, you're talking about her butt. I'm not into butt.

[02:28:14.580 --> 02:28:19.480]
Okay. I'm not, I don't care about her butt. You're about anybody's butt. I'm not into butt.

[02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:24.900]
That's a Cuban thing and a sparser thing like this, uh, you know, bro, that was just on

[02:28:24.900 --> 02:28:31.860]
there two seconds ago. Maybe that was the lintic biscuit doing a voice. Well, you know, he's

[02:28:31.860 --> 02:28:37.680]
trying to be black. He's trying real hard and he still sucks, lint biscuit. Yeah, that's what I say,

[02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:45.100]
but that horrible awful. Oh, man. And it's embarrassing. You see, it's a scry. I think it's a them.

[02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:51.720]
What? Not a hint. No, and I understand that. But if it's a them, you can't say if he had a brother named

[02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:57.700]
Dick. You say if they had a brother named Dick, let me get through all brothers. Maybe they're all

[02:28:57.700 --> 02:29:03.520]
brothers, huh? That could be it. Well, in any case, fuck it in and hold it.

[02:29:09.340 --> 02:29:18.920]
And it's out with the king of cop. His father fought his own sanity. And if you think we

[02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:22.060]
I'm gonna have to say that's a great big lie

[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:28.360]
Now when I see my kids face

[02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:32.000]
I like to see them but I don't have a chance

[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:36.920]
If I try to hold my money, we'll go bye-bye

[02:29:40.260 --> 02:29:45.380]
Oh, now to see that child in my eyes

[02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:53.340]
I never see the child in my eyes

[02:29:56.560 --> 02:30:00.240]
131-560 W.D. KINGUSH in very bad news, by the way

[02:30:00.240 --> 02:30:02.900]
Bad news, you know those hockey games this fall

[02:30:02.900 --> 02:30:04.320]
And next winner

[02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:06.660]
Andy will not be a hockey games

[02:30:06.660 --> 02:30:08.900]
You were right, you were saying he's not gonna be there, you were right

[02:30:09.420 --> 02:30:11.920]
Got confirmation somebody faxed me the obituary

[02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:14.300]
Andy Crawl, Peter R. Andy Crawl, 36

[02:30:15.060 --> 02:30:16.360]
Originally from Pennsylvania

[02:30:17.760 --> 02:30:20.180]
died suddenly Friday, July 9th

[02:30:21.200 --> 02:30:23.540]
Andy was an eagle scotted graduate of the university

[02:30:23.540 --> 02:30:25.760]
My name is proud member of Pi Kappa Alpha

[02:30:26.460 --> 02:30:29.340]
Known and respected in the automobile business for 15 years

[02:30:29.340 --> 02:30:31.760]
A strong supporter of local collegiate and professional sports

[02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:32.960]
A great Panthers fan

[02:30:34.260 --> 02:30:38.140]
His exuberant personality and quick wit will be sadly missed

[02:30:38.140 --> 02:30:40.660]
Etc. I already got it Adam, thank you

[02:30:40.660 --> 02:30:42.040]
So I already got two copies of it

[02:30:42.040 --> 02:30:44.140]
A third one will put me over the age, don't do it

[02:30:45.640 --> 02:30:48.680]
So it wasn't just a hoax, even though I know that Adam being a good guy

[02:30:48.680 --> 02:30:51.980]
Not the Adam or a salesperson, but Adam from the hockey games who faxed me the thing yesterday

[02:30:51.980 --> 02:30:54.180]
He wouldn't do something as tasteless and crash as that

[02:30:54.180 --> 02:30:56.720]
But nevertheless you're always hoping maybe it was just a prank

[02:30:56.720 --> 02:30:59.940]
Maybe it was just an April Fool's Day on the 12th of July

[02:31:00.700 --> 02:31:02.100]
Was it an April Fool's prank?

[02:31:02.240 --> 02:31:02.380]
No!

[02:31:02.580 --> 02:31:02.720]
No

[02:31:05.320 --> 02:31:09.140]
Andy's dead and Andy was 36 years old and Andy was fat

[02:31:13.060 --> 02:31:15.500]
Maybe I better skip that, Baskin Robbins, you know

[02:31:16.500 --> 02:31:16.880]
What?

[02:31:17.820 --> 02:31:18.200]
Please

[02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:21.080]
Well I wasn't seriously going to go to Baskin Robbins, it's out of the way

[02:31:21.800 --> 02:31:22.300]
Isn't it?

[02:31:22.940 --> 02:31:24.200]
Yeah, way out of the way

[02:31:24.200 --> 02:31:26.040]
No, it's not, it's right on the way

[02:31:26.580 --> 02:31:29.580]
Wait for something new and exciting to come out in the world of ice cream

[02:31:29.580 --> 02:31:31.420]
Like another fish food or something like that

[02:31:31.420 --> 02:31:32.520]
And what's that going to be?

[02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:33.600]
Oh, it just holds your breath

[02:31:37.360 --> 02:31:40.260]
Yeah, I'm holding it, you know you'll regret it if you have

[02:31:40.260 --> 02:31:42.440]
Well by the way, did we get one call on it?

[02:31:42.440 --> 02:31:42.520]
Who?

[02:31:43.120 --> 02:31:43.520]
Who?

[02:31:43.640 --> 02:31:43.640]

[02:31:43.720 --> 02:31:43.820]
Who?

[02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:51.160]
Okay now of course these people have no idea that's Toybox which is another group from Finland I think, Finland or Sweden

[02:31:51.160 --> 02:31:52.920]
I think Finland, where was aquafront?

[02:31:53.380 --> 02:31:55.260]
Sweden, Sweden, like I said they're from Sweden

[02:31:55.260 --> 02:31:59.800]
And they're like identically, even look like them and their music sounds and they're huge all over Europe

[02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:03.360]
And

[02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:06.700]
But anyway, you already heard that and of course they hated it like poison

[02:32:06.700 --> 02:32:10.880]
I was thinking there's also another huge record which will make it big here

[02:32:11.340 --> 02:32:12.480]
Guaranteed with you agree or not

[02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:16.240]
She's from Finland by the way, her name is Lene Marlin

[02:32:17.120 --> 02:32:18.500]
Is in O the Marlin

[02:32:19.280 --> 02:32:22.520]
Anyway, it goes on it's for minutes long, you don't want to hear the whole thing but never it's going to be big

[02:32:22.520 --> 02:32:26.660]
Trust me when I tell you, you heard it first here Lene Marlin, unforgivable-less center

[02:32:28.160 --> 02:32:31.940]
In the video, well anyway, here's a lady at Mobile and Tamerak, hello

[02:32:31.940 --> 02:32:33.240]
Hi Neil, how are you doing?

[02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:33.480]
Great

[02:32:33.880 --> 02:32:35.060]
That's good, welcome back

[02:32:35.060 --> 02:32:35.960]
Thank you so much

[02:32:35.960 --> 02:32:39.160]
All these idiots telling you Emily's and all this

[02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:44.460]
That's Amos and it's in Pomtheno on the federal highway

[02:32:44.460 --> 02:32:49.080]
Yeah, well in Amos, Emily Amos, it's got some of the same letters as in Night's Rate

[02:32:49.620 --> 02:32:53.920]
But I thought of something while you were away there was a picture on the front page of the Sun Sentinel

[02:32:53.920 --> 02:32:57.220]
The day after the boxed execution

[02:32:57.220 --> 02:32:57.940]
Yeah

[02:32:57.940 --> 02:32:59.780]
A mother entered

[02:32:59.780 --> 02:33:00.920]
Was it very nosebleed wasn't it?

[02:33:01.480 --> 02:33:02.680]
Yeah, well it was very good

[02:33:02.680 --> 02:33:03.220]
You know

[02:33:03.220 --> 02:33:04.820]
I don't care if they bleed at every hole

[02:33:05.460 --> 02:33:13.260]
But some mother and her two young children, six and seven or something, were outside the execution

[02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:17.700]
Holding signs of why do we kill people who kill

[02:33:17.700 --> 02:33:23.000]
And here this mother drags her children out at, God only knows what time in the morning

[02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:27.980]
To pray for the poor soul who's being executed

[02:33:27.980 --> 02:33:32.340]
I thought you know that's a great mother there taking her kids out in the middle of the night

[02:33:32.340 --> 02:33:34.960]
But well, I don't know

[02:33:34.960 --> 02:33:36.500]
Maybe we ought to start praying for the kids

[02:33:36.500 --> 02:33:40.640]
Yeah, well I don't know, maybe they should stop having babies or

[02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:41.400]
Oh God!

[02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:43.320]
A forced derolization sounds good to me

[02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:44.980]
Well definitely, but I have a mom

[02:33:44.980 --> 02:33:46.780]
Take the kids out of the trailer with that time of night

[02:33:46.780 --> 02:33:51.060]
Oh I know, we can help her from winter Haven, so I don't know how long we can get there

[02:33:51.060 --> 02:33:55.520]
Right on the far end of the paper, you know these kids are going to be like really messed up

[02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:58.580]
Like winter Haven, Lake City, yeah

[02:33:58.580 --> 02:34:00.920]
Hollywood, I don't think you need to know

[02:34:00.920 --> 02:34:08.380]
But also I had a flower delivery to little Miss Brittany Spears and I thought of you

[02:34:08.940 --> 02:34:14.860]
When she was at the Pompinow Beach Ampitheater I had a nice flower arrangement that went to her

[02:34:16.100 --> 02:34:19.940]
congratulating her on her first night of her first tour

[02:34:21.020 --> 02:34:24.840]
And thinking of her OAs love Jay

[02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:27.940]
So that made me think of you also

[02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:29.960]
Yeah

[02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:34.040]
Yeah well she's a little, I don't know, no comment

[02:34:34.040 --> 02:34:37.340]
She's a little one, she's a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll

[02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:41.140]
Well they, you know, they're like well these flowers are for a very special person

[02:34:41.140 --> 02:34:43.800]
I'm like well, you know, everybody's special, you know

[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:48.520]
She's nothing special, she's 17 year old, the answer, you know

[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:49.840]
With big boobs, yeah

[02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:52.100]
Yeah well she doesn't look as good first

[02:34:52.100 --> 02:34:53.320]
And it's true, she's the only one

[02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:54.960]
She wasn't that good in person, she was disappointing

[02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:59.880]
You know before the makeup and everything, you know she just looked like any other family girl

[02:34:59.880 --> 02:35:02.880]
So amazing what they can do with love with makeup, it's just astonishing

[02:35:03.300 --> 02:35:05.260]
Make up and boobs really, you know

[02:35:05.260 --> 02:35:09.780]
Yeah, they were more for Nick Carter too, the makeup wasn't bad in those boobs, that boobs job, it did it for Nick

[02:35:09.780 --> 02:35:11.460]
Okay listen have a great day, sweeter

[02:35:11.460 --> 02:35:12.860]
Thanks so can I make a request?

[02:35:13.020 --> 02:35:13.680]
Yes you can

[02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:15.500]
I'd like to smoke to your joints

[02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:16.800]
Alright, thank you sir

[02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:18.160]
And how about the bit, we'll play that too

[02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:20.280]
She wants to smoke to your joints, what on each corner of the mouth?

[02:35:20.700 --> 02:35:22.900]
She's over, out the moon Mark

[02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:40.780]
Okay

[02:35:41.780 --> 02:35:42.780]
Okay

[02:35:47.580 --> 02:35:47.940]
Roy

[02:35:47.940 --> 02:35:59.080]
Alright

[02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:30.380]
Oh

[02:36:30.380 --> 02:36:30.400]
Huh?

[02:36:47.980 --> 02:36:48.380]
Huh?

[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:50.060]
I'm the label

[02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:08.560]
I want to give you a chest

[02:37:12.140 --> 02:37:12.540]
Okay

[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:23.080]
I'm the one with the most beautiful eyes

[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:26.300]
I'm the one with the most beautiful eyes

[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:32.320]
I want to give you a heart, work, it's my

[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:35.860]
And from my mind, she wants to be

[02:37:35.860 --> 02:37:38.620]
So you choose to be better than that

[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:42.580]
And one day I'm the damn man

[02:37:42.580 --> 02:37:44.680]
And she's here to me again

[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:45.740]
You jerk

[02:37:45.740 --> 02:37:49.100]
I want to smoke to your joints, then I won't find it

[02:37:49.100 --> 02:37:50.860]
So take care of her

[02:37:50.860 --> 02:37:54.420]
That's why I smoke to your joints, it's a morning

[02:37:54.420 --> 02:37:54.900]
Oh

[02:37:54.900 --> 02:37:57.120]
I smoke to your joints, that's nice

[02:37:58.020 --> 02:38:01.160]
I smoke to your joints, then I'm gonna do it

[02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:02.120]
You jerk

[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:07.320]
I smoke to your joints, then I won't be

[02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:09.660]
And doing some work

[02:38:09.660 --> 02:38:10.880]
Are you?

[02:38:11.220 --> 02:38:14.180]
I smoke to your joints, then I smoke to your joints

[02:38:14.180 --> 02:38:17.760]
And then I smoke to your joints

[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:18.720]
That's what I do

[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:27.100]
I smoke to your joints

[02:38:34.380 --> 02:38:38.120]
The noises that spilled in our eyes

[02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:39.340]
the noise that were making our eyes

[02:38:39.340 --> 02:38:40.540]
I don't want to cause your own最近

[02:38:49.100 --> 02:38:56.200]
So who are the mustard pepper rings

[02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:05.680]
Okay, 13 to two of five, 60 WQM.

[02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:10.040]
A couple minutes we're going to be previewing the new single by Limpwist Biscuit.

[02:39:11.020 --> 02:39:11.880]
Isn't that its name?

[02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:13.820]
Limp Dick Riss.

[02:39:15.100 --> 02:39:17.140]
Here's what is the St. Johnbury Vermont?

[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:18.940]
Daniel.

[02:39:19.180 --> 02:39:19.500]
Yes, sir.

[02:39:20.100 --> 02:39:22.080]
This one, the dictionary, we've got some listeners in the real world.

[02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:23.100]
Oh my God.

[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:25.120]
We had a call today from Korea.

[02:39:25.700 --> 02:39:28.580]
We had a call from Weird.

[02:39:28.940 --> 02:39:29.740]
A few places.

[02:39:30.340 --> 02:39:30.820]
Oh, we smoke.

[02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:32.900]
You guys live in a different planet.

[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:33.700]
Yes, we do.

[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:35.040]
I'm the Lvivable.

[02:39:35.180 --> 02:39:36.200]
We live on Uranus.

[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:41.380]
Just interesting to know though that the more the wheels come off of your government,

[02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:42.820]
the more entertaining it is for us.

[02:39:43.020 --> 02:39:43.280]
Exactly.

[02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:44.260]
That's a good work.

[02:39:44.460 --> 02:39:45.160]
God bless you, sir.

[02:39:45.340 --> 02:39:46.500]
I can say how to bend anjury.

[02:39:46.700 --> 02:39:46.980]
You bet.

[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:47.420]
Okay.

[02:39:48.380 --> 02:39:50.880]
Well, I'm talking about one thing that lunch is starting to work.

[02:39:50.980 --> 02:39:53.320]
Like the four seasons is working my way back through you.

[02:39:53.420 --> 02:39:53.920]
Remember that song?

[02:39:54.760 --> 02:39:55.960]
That's what it's doing right now.

[02:39:56.640 --> 02:39:57.340]
Thank you so much.

[02:39:57.460 --> 02:39:59.120]
By the way, Chuck, we're interrupting a very busy day.

[02:39:59.180 --> 02:39:59.820]
He's a hell of a guy.

[02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:00.880]
Chuck over at the sub-center.

[02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:02.760]
He's been real good to us.

[02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:03.360]
I'll tell you that.

[02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:05.560]
Here's a mobile in West Palm Beach.

[02:40:05.620 --> 02:40:05.760]
Hilla.

[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:08.700]
Mobile in West Palm.

[02:40:10.240 --> 02:40:12.800]
26 minutes and 29 seconds and they're gone.

[02:40:12.860 --> 02:40:13.700]
And we were paying for it.

[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:14.760]
That's the bitch of the whole of the year.

[02:40:15.500 --> 02:40:17.040]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:19.500]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:40:19.580 --> 02:40:19.980]
Here's Miami.

[02:40:20.200 --> 02:40:20.360]
Hello.

[02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:21.480]
Hey, Nea, how you doing?

[02:40:21.620 --> 02:40:22.020]
Okay, sir.

[02:40:22.020 --> 02:40:24.240]
I just want to let you know there's some of us out here pissed off

[02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:26.200]
and fired up about this sales tax.

[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:27.020]
Oh, you're the one, huh?

[02:40:27.300 --> 02:40:27.740]
Yeah, I'm the one.

[02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:29.680]
You know, sometimes every time you open the paper,

[02:40:29.900 --> 02:40:32.420]
if there is no more corruption in day county or city of Miami

[02:40:32.940 --> 02:40:35.760]
and they still need extra money, I don't have a problem with that.

[02:40:36.140 --> 02:40:38.980]
But when a guy's filling up his boat in his car to go fishing

[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:41.180]
and putting it on a city gas cart,

[02:40:41.560 --> 02:40:42.900]
or you look at the port scandals,

[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:47.040]
I mean, they advertise under 836 about how the airport

[02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:48.300]
is a third business in the world.

[02:40:48.980 --> 02:40:51.700]
In the port of Miami is one of the busiest ports in the world.

[02:40:51.700 --> 02:40:53.260]
And they can't make any money.

[02:40:53.580 --> 02:40:55.120]
And there's not a problem.

[02:40:55.320 --> 02:40:56.880]
You know what I honestly think?

[02:40:57.120 --> 02:40:58.660]
And the best part of the whole deal is that,

[02:40:58.820 --> 02:41:01.340]
as you know, the county and city governments are in bed

[02:41:01.340 --> 02:41:02.760]
as is the hero of the Mickey Erison.

[02:41:03.220 --> 02:41:04.320]
And most of the money that he makes,

[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:06.140]
not a penny of it goes to the county,

[02:41:06.420 --> 02:41:07.820]
or the US government or anybody else

[02:41:07.820 --> 02:41:10.860]
because it's all registered to other countries, all this shit.

[02:41:10.980 --> 02:41:13.680]
Yeah, but you know what I think it's simplistic as saying

[02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:16.200]
if we had a real newspaper who did some investigating

[02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:17.200]
and stopped all the crap.

[02:41:17.260 --> 02:41:18.000]
But we never will.

[02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:20.080]
I think it really starts there.

[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:21.520]
And nobody's looking out for it.

[02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:23.440]
You get more information out of the new times,

[02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:25.360]
reading an article about corruption and day count

[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:26.100]
and you will in the air.

[02:41:26.260 --> 02:41:26.460]
Right.

[02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:28.220]
You know, it's just tired.

[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:29.440]
I didn't move to Broward.

[02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:32.700]
But you know, I do work in Dade and I run a business here.

[02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:34.540]
But I just, it's sad.

[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:35.620]
I grew up here all my life.

[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:39.320]
And I'm only 33 years old and I hate to sound like an old man.

[02:41:39.460 --> 02:41:41.500]
But I tell you what, this town used to be great.

[02:41:41.580 --> 02:41:43.300]
I used to live in Westchester, moved out the Kendall.

[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:44.440]
It was a great town.

[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:45.340]
It's sad.

[02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:47.220]
Go down drive, you haven't driven down Astrino.

[02:41:47.340 --> 02:41:48.020]
Oh my god.

[02:41:48.540 --> 02:41:48.920]
It's over.

[02:41:49.460 --> 02:41:50.360]
It's, you know, people.

[02:41:50.860 --> 02:41:52.560]
Oh, it's really bad.

[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:54.300]
And it's just it's not getting any better.

[02:41:54.440 --> 02:41:57.080]
And people, how much can't, how much can people spend?

[02:41:57.240 --> 02:41:57.840]
When's enough enough?

[02:41:58.200 --> 02:41:59.060]
You know, it's as simple.

[02:41:59.180 --> 02:41:59.960]
When is enough enough?

[02:42:00.260 --> 02:42:01.320]
I'll see you on County Line Road.

[02:42:01.500 --> 02:42:01.680]
Yeah.

[02:42:02.900 --> 02:42:05.540]
10 till 2 at 560 WQM 567.

[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:06.440]
We got one guy there.

[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:06.960]
It's pissed off.

[02:42:06.960 --> 02:42:07.660]
I fired up.

[02:42:07.780 --> 02:42:08.480]
Thank God for that.

[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:09.220]
Don't forget.

[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:10.760]
Just say, tell all your friends.

[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:11.000]
No.

[02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:11.900]
Vote early enough.

[02:42:12.100 --> 02:42:13.340]
No, no, no, no.

[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:13.440]

[02:42:13.500 --> 02:42:13.800]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[02:42:13.860 --> 02:42:14.260]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[02:42:14.260 --> 02:42:15.760]
OK, just tell them to, oh my god.

[02:42:16.220 --> 02:42:17.100]
Get up and go down.

[02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:17.880]
Something like that.

[02:42:19.140 --> 02:42:21.360]
Just like Limp Dick Biscuit would say.

[02:42:22.660 --> 02:42:24.560]
Even the name of the group, you know, Limp Biscuit.

[02:42:24.740 --> 02:42:25.700]
I mean, what does that tell you?

[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:26.260]
How bad?

[02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:27.580]
How really and truly bad?

[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:28.500]
And George likes that.

[02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:30.420]
Doesn't that tell you everything you didn't know about his music

[02:42:30.420 --> 02:42:31.140]
about your taste?

[02:42:33.100 --> 02:42:33.420]
Awful.

[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:34.480]
You like that toy box.

[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:35.880]
Yeah.

[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:38.240]
Well, you know something.

[02:42:38.380 --> 02:42:42.700]
If you saw the video, you, I mean, it's a novelty record.

[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:43.020]
OK?

[02:42:43.020 --> 02:42:46.020]
They've even done a remake of the witch doctor, not toy

[02:42:46.020 --> 02:42:47.400]
boxes, some other group that sound like.

[02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:48.060]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:42:48.380 --> 02:42:48.380]

[02:42:49.080 --> 02:42:49.440]
Yeah.

[02:42:50.100 --> 02:42:51.720]
In fact, I'm going to bring that in tomorrow.

[02:42:52.020 --> 02:42:53.620]
If we don't get a lot of calls tomorrow, I'm playing the guy

[02:42:53.620 --> 02:42:54.360]
damn witch doctor.

[02:42:54.800 --> 02:42:58.040]
Oh, yeah, David Sivil turned over on his grave.

[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:02.200]
I like that toy box.

[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:04.700]
I hate to break the news to you, but Europe is so far ahead of us.

[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:06.140]
Not just the music, but of course, and everything.

[02:43:06.540 --> 02:43:08.480]
But musically, I mean, you're like light years ahead.

[02:43:10.380 --> 02:43:11.100]
Like Aqua.

[02:43:11.260 --> 02:43:12.880]
Aqua was big here, which that was

[02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:15.080]
also, I'm not saying that was a good record barbie doll,

[02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:15.700]
but it was cute.

[02:43:15.820 --> 02:43:16.740]
It was a novelty record.

[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:17.820]
And the video was good.

[02:43:17.900 --> 02:43:18.420]
It was well done.

[02:43:18.700 --> 02:43:21.200]
Well, this is similar, almost exactly the same, but better.

[02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:24.780]
And Lenin Marlin, you're telling me you didn't like you loved

[02:43:24.780 --> 02:43:26.480]
Lenin, but even his eyeballs were rolling,

[02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:28.580]
but he didn't want to admit it because I'm the one that brought it in.

[02:43:28.820 --> 02:43:31.480]
And he'd be admitting that maybe my taste wasn't as bad as he usually

[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:32.380]
claims that it is.

[02:43:33.880 --> 02:43:37.320]
Plus the backstreet boys are just tearing him up all over the goddamn world.

[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:37.840]
I mean, just
