[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.220]
TV TV TV TV TV TV TV TV TV TVTV

[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.940]
Virtually I got it we went yesterday from the pot where you could like crank it all the way down

[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.220]
And it was still loud and today I got it all the way up and

[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.040]
Tell you really sucks, but anyway, we don't want to dwell on that the a Dow made 10,000 this morning

[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.080]
Oh, and it's underneath it again

[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.820]
People on CNN I'm gonna tell you something. I don't want to you know pee on your parade

[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.960]
We all got money in the stock market anybody. It's got more than ten bucks to their name is got something

[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.160]
They got mutual funds. They got stock they got something we all got sucked into this big

[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.440]
Gamble this big charade like you know some idiots out there got sucked into one of their phony fight

[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.760]
See I don't understand it's like somebody goes to the racetrack and they bet some money on a race there

[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.540]
Oh gee that race look fixed

[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.520]
Yeah

[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.640]
Same thing with these boxing idiots, you know it's like going to a professional wrestling. Oh, I think this thing is rigged and

[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.460]
What's the point?

[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.820]
You know that business about a sucker is born every minute

[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.120]
They just keep coming back and coming back come on punish me with me beat me, etc

[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.180]
But getting back to the stock market which by the way, let's see all look at that Wow 65 points away how the mighty have fallen

[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.100]
15 minutes ago they were like Maria Bartiromo was jumping up and down on CNBC and CNN

[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.000]
Would you like even hyperventilating 100 times worse major breaking news, you know, it's just an artificial number

[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.360]
But it's that pack mentality the psychology of it, you know we broke through 10,000

[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.780]
Oh my god, this guy isn't falling after all

[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.580]
I don't make it a fortune aren't we are we getting rich? No

[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.100]
Because we get sucked in by and like I said yesterday everybody's an expert

[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.800]
This one tells you it's a bull market and the other way. It's a bear market and the other one well

[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.540]
We don't really know it's all about to bull what it is crap

[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.640]
Because nobody really knows

[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.280]
And yes some people got lucky and some people got some good inside information some people got some bad inside information

[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.000]
But so watch the way these people were hyperventilating this morning and there's tear there's throwing paper there throwing

[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.240]
Confetti around there like like we did like we do years eve

[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.840]
And guess what now we're 67 points away and dropping like a rock. I hate to break the news to you

[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:11.380]
But it anyway. It's only cash boys and girls. It's only money. Yeah, what what happened in here from yesterday to today with the overhead?

[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.900]
I don't know sucks

[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.320]
From one extreme to the other but nevertheless it's the QAMF and way baby. We don't want to start complaining technical

[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.940]
Well, I got about 35 million things today and thank God for that because after yesterday with this oh brother with this crowd

[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.400]
Guess what I got in the mail at home yesterday my Florida Panthers playoff tickets in boys. No. Yes

[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.440]
It's right

[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.020]
They want

[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.400]
$1,200 and five bucks is what they want

[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.080]
$1,080 for playoff rounds one and two and 120 bucks for a playoff part

[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.200]
What do I care that you reimburse me here anyway? What do I give a crap if I wait long enough?

[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.520]
But it's just the idea see what I want you to understand this is for all the season ticket holders

[00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.280]
Now we still got about what 16 17 games left in a regular season something like that and

[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.720]
It's a very good chance that this team is not going to make the playoffs

[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.140]
Very good chance especially if Pavel Burrito come back very soon and the rumor around the league is he ain't coming back to

[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.160]
Through the rest of the season he's out for the year. That's the rumor not in this town

[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.520]
But around the rest of the league they're whispering. I guess what he ain't coming back this year

[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.380]
Which if and that's the case it's gonna be real tough

[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.840]
So so stop and think about this you don't get refunds on your playoff tickets

[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.780]
You have to put the money up by a certain date which in this case they wanted by

[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.980]
What's the date that we want my money by March 26th? It's only like 10 days away

[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.040]
If you want to sew up those the playoff round one two tickets

[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:50.480]
And if they don't make it guess what happened they hold your money and they quitted it toward next year's bill for next year's tickets

[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.000]
How'd you like to have a scam going like that where you just basically hold on to people's money as long as you want and you're making the interest on it

[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.180]
I mean figure out we got about 16 17,000 season ticket holders

[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.560]
Times at least however much it is you know, and then there's sweet the sweets and the boxes

[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.940]
God only knows how much those bastards have to pay for the playoffs and they just kind of hang on to your money

[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.860]
So like I said the suckers born every minute and yes, I will be sending in the money because thank God they reimburse me from here

[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.880]
I found I came across in this book vulgar favors by Marine orth about the Conan in the story

[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:33.180]
Found one page for getting about Andrew Conan and Gianni Versace that ties into something we've talked about on this show many many times

[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.160]
And yeah, all these people in this audience who professed an ignorance of this you're looking for glory holds

[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.600]
This may give them a little bit more insight although it's really bizarre very strange

[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.280]
Wait till you're this

[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:53.560]
It says between the stalls in a men's room on one of San Diego's Navy bases is a waste high hole barely large enough to accommodate a man's

[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.400]
Finger

[00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.860]
Lunchtime is the best time to visit it Steven Zeeland writes in the article killer Queen

[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.360]
Public in Seattle's game magazine the stranger

[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.120]
Holes like this are known as glory holes

[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.400]
In 1995 Zeeland says he told Jade Buckman about an especially beautiful man

[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.460]
He'd seen there three times turns out this guy was Jeff what was the name Jeff trail one the guys have couldn't kill

[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:26.640]
The guy was shy and only once briefly did he kneel down now listen to this and in accordance with the prevailing etiquette etiquette

[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.840]
Stick his penis under the stall

[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:40.580]
Most of the time we just watched either through the hole or took turns sticking our pinkies through it touching just barely the tips of each other's

[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.620]
Penises Zeeland learned to identify the man by the cartoon mouse tattooed on his ankle

[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.880]
But go let's go back to that one line again

[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:56.560]
In accordance with prevailing etiquette etiquette only once did he stick his penis under the stall now we've all been in

[00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.440]
Public restrooms right

[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:08.540]
Now you know where the stall comes down to like what we just say a couple inches above the floor. Yeah, not more than a foot right. Oh less than that

[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.860]
How do you stick your penis under the stall

[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.100]
He got me

[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:30.500]
Man you're looking for glory hole. Whoo that is bizarre baby pretty good book though by the way pretty interesting if you're interested in that which I know none of you are

[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:40.300]
They stick their penis in accordance to etiquette now is that like Martha Stewart written about that or Amy Vanderbilt in the book of etiquette

[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.920]
That if you're good at like you know give a proper greeting at a glory hole you stick your

[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.800]
As in members only under the stall oh

[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.220]
Bad news by the way. It's an epidemic

[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.200]
Dead Superman another one

[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.400]
Kirk Allen never heard of

[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:12.400]
After Kirk Allen the dance you followed friend Red Scalton the Hollywood became films first Superman died after long illness

[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.320]
He was 88 that's old enough

[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.560]
Mr. Rowland died on Sunday in a hospital. There is home in the woodlands Texas just north of Houston

[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.240]
Superman the comic book here aboard in the depression already a captain's imagination of a generation of children in print and on radio

[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.300]
Well, Mr. Rowland agreed to play the part 1948 by the way

[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:33.440]
Bud Conier used to play a Superman on radio. Do you remember bud Conier from to tell the truth?

[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:34.720]
Huh?

[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:42.460]
He's dead. Let's see bud Conier's dead. He was Superman this guy Kirk Allen just died. He was Superman George Reeves played Superman

[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:47.280]
He's dead. Bloo is brains up and Christopher Reeve

[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.320]
Not dead

[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.780]
But have it kind of a tough time of it

[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.340]
So there you go. I guess the Superman wasn't quite so

[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.580]
Involvable as he all thought

[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.220]
You know about that Jimmy Olson don't you know what he was uh-huh

[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.240]
10 minutes after 10 at 5 60 in fact. He's probably looking for glory holes. Is he dead Jimmy Olson?

[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.080]
Huh?

[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.500]
The actor that played Jimmy Olson dead or alive there is your challenge for this morning boys and girls

[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.140]
Which I don't have no idea what her uh-uh. It's name was

[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.880]
Where you fudge back in?

[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.620]
Famous

[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:27.080]
We don't stop and go to the movies

[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.020]
This is sorry

[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.700]
Funny

[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.560]
Doesn't stand rechts

[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:58.060]
What's he doing Jackson

[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.380]
every time he jumps you can see his basketball

[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.280]
every time he's a great target

[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.060]
we're having to stop now

[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:14.440]
we're having to stop now

[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.120]
we're having to stop now

[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.260]
we're having to stop now

[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:21.960]
we're having to stop now

[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.380]
I'm going to have a class for example

[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.400]
what we were talking about

[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.240]
another asshole

[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.960]
oh yeah but he's going to help the team

[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.580]
we want him you know

[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.680]
same old crass

[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.220]
Dennis Rodman part of the scenery

[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.280]
that's what it says this morning

[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.000]
scum sentinel

[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.100]
panthers aren't the only professional athletes

[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.860]
at the Hard Rock Hotel in Casino in Vegas

[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.620]
Dennis Rodman, did he's Rodman

[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.120]
who left the Lakers base

[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.280]
supposedly because he had personal problems to take care of

[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.000]
maybe had gambling problems to take care

[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:54.300]
because he's plunging his brains out

[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.080]
in Las Vegas

[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.800]
a great old time

[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.460]
the NBA forward was seen out on the town several times

[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.760]
Sunday and Monday it is typically

[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.540]
flashy outfits looking like a real piece of crap

[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.640]
looking like a real asshole

[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.480]
and there you go

[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.920]
and I heard like about 30 seconds of that conversation this morning

[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.320]
about the panthers being in Vegas

[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.360]
and about you know what kind of a message that send

[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.640]
all the young kids on the team

[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.160]
and this and that who gives a crap

[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.560]
you know when you come right down to it

[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.620]
what differences are made?

[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.480]
let him go out there and have a good time

[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.320]
let Robbie need him or plunge away his lunch money

[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.020]
okay maybe he'll learn what hunger is really all about

[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.340]
what the hell does this amic

[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.080]
it's you know going out there and playing the game

[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.820]
it's a lack of talent that's the problem

[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.080]
and I'm still I still am amazed

[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.100]
that the team with this marginal personnel

[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.740]
without Paul Vellbury is really right around the 500 mark

[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.240]
and still very close only a point out of a playoff spot

[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.860]
so they ought to be kissing the ground

[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.820]
by the way speaking a kiss in the ground

[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.240]
Joe Costello was a good guy

[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.700]
but he had a very bad taste in sports

[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.080]
in fact Joe Costello really is in the sports fan

[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.100]
which is why he's going to be doing a new show on our station

[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.440]
starting this Saturday morning

[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.540]
let's hear it for Joe

[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.880]
I hope that his arm doesn't fall off before the show starts

do you see that thing yesterday

[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.840]
yesterday it was red today it's green

[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.740]
and his arm too

[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.100]
looks like a little gang green sent in

[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.700]

[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.680]

oh yeah millions of this is the most

[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.380]
popular sport in the world even bigger than golf

[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.020]
please join me in welcoming this new show

[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.700]
to the QA and lineup and wishing Joe success

[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.960]
on his new adventure it says

[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.380]
Duff Lindsay

[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.000]
by the way speaking of all of that

[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.280]
and the thing I read from the book about the glory holes

[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.380]
so I went down the hall to take a leak this morning

[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.920]
since we're now up on the third floor

[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.720]
and we now have new facilities up there

[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.220]
two big glory holes drilled in the

[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.140]
wooden partition between the stalls in there

[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.400]
any ideas on who drilled those?

[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.260]
uh-huh seriously

[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.080]
two enormous not one but two

[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.960]
big glory holes

[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:14.700]
drilled in the wall

[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.980]
here's a letter to the editor and the

[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.880]
Harold again now this one just to see

[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.740]
I'm tempted to go both ways on this letter

[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.340]
because we know that the hero basically

[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.960]
are a bunch of blue nose anti-semitic

[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.760]
assholes but as far as being racist

[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.760]
uh... they could be uh-huh I don't know

[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.020]
but I don't know about you but I'm just sick

[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.000]
and tired of this kind of crap just like on the front

[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.980]
page of the paper architect for arena

[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.760]
under fire for the new american

[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.360]
airlines micky arison uh... mayor penis arena

[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.300]
affirmative action violation is alleged

[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.100]
i can't stand the way i sound in this room

[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.340]
i just like to tell you how to

[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.840]
yesterday and today i feel like

[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.980]
instead of doing a show i feel like i'm doing an out of

[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.000]
body experience it feels like the show is going on

[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.320]
but i'm watching it from the outside like a ghost

[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.460]
because it just sounds like crap

[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:01.860]
but anyway

[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.420]
uh... the official the architect of the new american

[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.780]
airlines arena three contractors could be bonds from the job

[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.600]
and bar from doing business with mimey date

[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.580]
county for a year for allegedly violating

[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.300]
county's rules on affirmative action

[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.180]
in other words they didn't hire enough

[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.020]
supposed to grow drug Ace is what that means

[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.040]
I I you know and i i i i i i i i i i thought we were past that

[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.440]
i thought we were getting rid of that crap

[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.160]
that we have to have quotas and you have to hire

[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.860]
enough people regardless of uh... you know

[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.900]
whether you got an IQ larger than their penis size

[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.100]
or they could stick it underneath the styling the

[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.540]
ethereal

[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.880]
so i'm getting back to the letter to the editor

[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.300]
which is from Bradford brown second vice

[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.640]
President of the NAACP, Miami-Dade Branch, Opalaka.

[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.060]
Here's the letter, very short and sweet, and really makes my blood boil when I'm

[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:45.820]
re-crap like this.

[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:52.460]
I mean, see if my life was that empty, that shallow, or maybe that perfect, that this

[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.120]
is the only kind of stuff that I had to worry about, I'd say, yeah!

[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.260]
The perception that the Harold is insensitive to many of the concerns of the Black community

[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.300]
was enhanced recently by the coverage of the Grammy Awards.

[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.080]
The Harold ran a picture of Madonna, but not Lauren Hill.

[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.520]
The New York Times ran pictures of both.

[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.020]
End of letter to the editor.

[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.600]
From the local NAACP chapter in Opalaka.

[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.960]
Is that unbelievable?

[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:22.420]
Uh-huh.

[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:22.840]
Or what?

[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.300]
You're a bunch of racist because you ran a picture of Madonna and not Lauren Hill.

[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.500]
First of all, we all know Madonna, whether we like her, whether we can't stand her, whether

[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.760]
we think she can sing, whether she thinks she's a skank and a scumbag and smells bad,

[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.900]
whatever we think we know Madonna, everybody in the world.

[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.700]
Even people that wouldn't know the president wouldn't know their own parents, they know

[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.140]
Madonna.

[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.300]
Lauren Hill?

[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.420]
If Lauren, I mean, I know who she is, she's a hip-hop, a rap singer, okay?

[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.500]
Who won the grand, she was a bit, you know, I can't stand her because she bit out the

[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.780]
backdoor voice for the best new artist of the year in the Grammy.

[00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:01.480]
But nevertheless, if she walked into the door right now, if that door swung open right

[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.440]
now, and that was Lauren Hill, would anybody in here recognize her?

[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.180]
Of course not.

[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.020]
Have no idea who else she was.

[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:13.740]
But it's racist again because you pay the, I mean, people looking for problems, people

[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.900]
looking to get pissed off, people walking around with a big, big chip on her shoulder.

[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.320]
And I'm sick and tired of it because it is the American F&W.

[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.960]
It's really, really old and tired.

[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.780]
By the way, speaking of old and tired, we're in our new studio as up here in the third

[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.660]
floor, which sound really bad near to me, by the way.

[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.820]
But nevertheless, so I walk out in here yesterday.

[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:31.920]
A few minutes after two.

[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.200]
Usually it's right at two, but we were trying to unscrew some of the stuff that screwed

[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:36.540]
up in here.

[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.040]
I walk out a few minutes after two.

[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.520]
And here, Sam, the sham has got a little office in there.

[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.260]
Our promotion, man.

[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.300]
And as I'm starting to take a couple of steps down the hall of the door, Mark, exit.

[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.520]
I hear, Neil, where are you going?

[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.360]
I said, home.

[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.700]
Oh, come on, I sit down for a minute.

[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.680]
And I kind of wandered over to the door when I gave me a whimsical, quizzical look.

[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:57.760]
I said, huh?

[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.840]
You said, yeah, come on, sit down for a couple of minutes.

[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.020]
I said, for what?

[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:07.060]
And he just looked at me like, and I started like, again, heading down.

[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:07.620]
I'm, where are you going?

[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.940]
I said, home.

[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.940]
And as I kind of waddled out of here and down the elevator, I was thinking to myself,

[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:18.560]
chuckling as I went down that elevator shaft, what in the world could I possibly talk to

[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.580]
that man about promoting this show?

[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.940]
I mean, that, that, you know, is a given.

[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.620]
We don't have any promotion on this radio station.

[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:30.960]
What in the world could I possibly talk to Sam the scam about in his little orifice

[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.380]
in there?

[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:34.800]
About the business?

[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:35.220]
No.

[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:35.980]
About life?

[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:36.380]
No.

[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.540]
About his girlfriend?

[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:37.940]
No.

[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.200]
About all the free tickets that he gets to all the events and concerts?

[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:41.560]
No.

[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.360]
But all the action he's getting in the QM sky box?

[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:44.820]
No.

[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.680]
No, nothing that's of any interest to me.

[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.780]
What could I possibly talk to that man about?

[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.280]
So I hope that this fascination with the fact that we're up here on this floor ends

[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.080]
real soon because the one good thing is that we got you just go straight around.

[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.860]
You follow the corridor right around to the right.

[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.700]
You make it out of, and you're right there at the door.

[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.120]
You slide along the wall there.

[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:04.800]
You're right at the elevator.

[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:05.940]
You're gone like a shot.

[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:07.960]
Just like a shot.

[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:08.620]
That's it.

[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.080]
So don't be bugging me anymore, Sam.

[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:10.360]
Okay?

[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.220]
I got nothing to say to you other than goodbye and have a nice day.

[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.540]
By the way, the market is down 22 points.

[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.940]
So now it's a long way from that euphoria of about 40 minutes ago when it crossed 10,000

[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.360]
and they were jumping up and down on TV like Rumpel Stiltskin.

[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.940]
Like they just all had multiple orgasms together.

[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.220]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:29.540]
Hello?

[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.600]
Mobile in Miami.

[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.380]
Hey, I knew.

[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.780]
Our first call of the day, yes?

[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:36.640]
I knew.

[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:37.460]
Okay.

[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.480]
I got one story to tell you that I've been able to get out of my mind yet.

[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.540]
I worked for Miami Day Transit and Sunday.

[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.060]
We were at Berkel Station.

[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.840]
We were providing shuttle buses to the Kayao tree event.

[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.660]
Yes.

[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:59.700]
And also at the station, there were five police officers with T-shirt, multi gang unit agency.

[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.360]
And our group came in.

[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.040]
They all had money.

[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:05.900]
Yes.

[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.420]
Except for one girl.

[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.280]
She didn't have the $1.25 that gave inside the metro station.

[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.180]
So she was asking around people for the $1.25.

[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:19.980]
She was so high.

[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.380]
She couldn't be any more than 17, 18 years old.

[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.180]
And there was this muscular police officer, a real young.

[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.040]
He took her to his car.

[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:38.400]
He took a Polaroid camera and she lifted her dress up and he took about four pictures of

[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:38.800]
her hiding.

[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.900]
I couldn't believe that.

[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:41.400]
Correct him.

[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:41.780]
Yeah.

[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:42.380]
We don't need that.

[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.040]
That's incredible.

[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:44.460]
Yeah.

[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.340]
Okay.

[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.100]
Well, call us when you have your next one of these.

[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:48.380]
Okay.

[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.600]
We have another hot flash.

[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:50.360]
All right.

[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:50.840]
Okay.

[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:51.440]
Thank you.

[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.320]
560, 705, 60, 05, 60 on a mobile online.

[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.280]
Anybody else got any stories like that out there today?

[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:56.740]
Come on.

[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.440]
You can make some up.

[00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.120]
That's what this audience is good at.

[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.860]
I mean, when you don't have a life, at least make one up.

[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:02.680]
Here's a pompano.

[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:02.920]
Hello.

[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.440]
Morning, Uncle Neil.

[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:04.680]
Go.

[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.360]
I report from the scum sent.

[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.660]
No, if you haven't seen it already.

[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:09.000]
Yeah.

[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:09.700]
This is a chronic.

[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.000]
Yes.

[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.200]
Republic, selling candle Toyota back to the original owners.

[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:14.600]
Really?

[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:15.080]
Yeah.

[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:15.960]
Not too bad.

[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.720]
We're done with them.

[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:17.140]
Yeah.

[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:17.740]
They lose.

[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:18.220]
Yeah.

[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:19.360]
Have a look at that.

[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.000]
That republic stock.

[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.700]
The market went up 82 points yesterday.

[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.880]
The republic is 13 and a quarter.

[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.680]
I think it closed that yesterday in the toilet.

[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.620]
Have a good one.

[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:26.960]
Okay.

[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:27.320]
Thank you.

[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.200]
Thanks for the good news, chronic.

[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.060]
560, 705, 60, 05, 60 on a mobile online.

[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.520]
Let's have a few phone calls on here.

[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.980]
Let's talk about white spider bites.

[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.260]
You know, today's thing is I got a sore breastbone.

[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.240]
You know, right here?

[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:39.220]
What?

[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.660]
I mean, not that sore, but a little sore.

[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.660]
I don't know from what?

[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.680]
From getting old.

[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.240]
Akes and pains.

[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.260]
How the hell do I know?

[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.280]
I'm not going to start panicking.

[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.140]
Every day I got something new and different.

[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.340]
My spider bites are healing up very nicely.

[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.460]
Look how nice that's coming along.

[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:55.980]
Now that that's that's taking care of.

[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.460]
Now I got a sore breastbone.

[00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.720]
Probably for rough sex.

[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.560]
Probably from hot gay sex on the plane.

[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.940]
By the way, Hank, you're right about Delta.

[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.520]
They suck.

[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.740]
God, do they suck?

[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.340]
They're food sucks.

[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.080]
They can't take off on time.

[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.340]
They can't do anything right.

[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.340]
They haven't got a clue what they're doing.

[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.440]
When there was an airline that I used to really love was Delta Airlines years ago.

[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.940]
I mean, it's a long, distant memory now.

[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.900]
And now they are garbage, man.

[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:21.540]
They really blow.

[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.080]
But you know, you don't have much of a choice.

[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.080]
They got you coming and going.

[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.420]
That's one of the great things with the airlines.

[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.820]
They got you right by the short hairs because there's very...

[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.920]
Well, whatever happened to that national airline member,

[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.680]
there was supposed to start in January or February at the latest.

[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.140]
Non-stop direct flights from the Florida Dale and Miami to Vegas.

[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.200]
Anybody ever hear any more about that?

[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:40.540]
No.

[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.160]
No, not a word.

[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:42.760]
I don't get that.

[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.540]
There's more goddamn people that go from here to Vegas that love Vegas.

[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.100]
They just wish they had some action going on in their lives.

[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.860]
And you have to go through Atlanta, through Dallas.

[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.100]
You got to go through a big...

[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.680]
And then of course that Dallas airport, especially if you take a American.

[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.340]
Were you on that one trip with us?

[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.920]
Were we had to go get on that damn shuttle and go outside it?

[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:02.200]
Yeah.

[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.860]
It looks like if you're going around the whole border of the state of Texas,

[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.620]
which is the size of Alaska, by the way.

[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.740]
Jesus Christ takes you by the...

[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.560]
Thank God we had enough time to make the connection.

[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.300]
Still Roger's got.

[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.220]
Come along with me to blow up an abortion plan,

[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.100]
to kill another doctor who was murdered in the camp.

[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.080]
Think with a draw and have a bad attitude and grab a can of gas

[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.960]
and you can burn one down to abortion clinic, that is.

[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.060]
Ain't nothing like the smell and nurses on fire.

[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.960]
Now, if you drive a truck and wear a smelly hat

[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.660]
and own a village and use this welcome hat,

[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.400]
and after we make the clinic explode,

[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.160]
we'll go find a maker and drag them down the road.

[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.100]
We'll be proud you're from the South Boy,

[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.360]
double wide, Southern Fry.

[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.640]
Now if there should be a woman trapped inside,

[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.320]
we'll rape her in the ass and steal her first before she dies.

[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.700]
And paraphrase the Bible to Valorate,

[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.120]
Dave, our barbarism ignorance and seizing a...

[00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:58.540]
All right!

[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.300]
Inbred that is, fire ups and garths looks too.

[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.260]
Now we are the Christian soldiers of God,

[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.840]
who like to wife our house with an old porn god.

[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.480]
And when we're not burning churches or clinics down,

[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.480]
we play our bandos in the trees with pieces in our mouth.

[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.120]
That's what Christians require,

[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.560]
right there in the old ground-eye.

[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.400]
1033 at 560 WQM,

[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.660]
by the way, is there a crossover between country music and NASCAR?

[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.700]
I mean, is it the...

[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.460]
You asked Bill Costello next time he pops his head in the Dwarf

[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.220]
and he likes country music.

[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.360]
What are you grinning about?

[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.580]
Pickin' and grinning, that's what that's all about.

[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:34.660]
Huh?

[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.860]
Dale Earnhardt is here.

[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:37.400]
All right!

[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.180]
In effect, I was watching the Hercunes play a hockey game last week.

[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.260]
I forget what Game of Wast.

[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.700]
And they had a much bigger than usual crowds,

[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.380]
and to usually have about 500 people in there

[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.400]
and Greensboro out in the middle of nowhere in Yenem'sville.

[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.340]
And they had a lot of people there,

[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.680]
and they were saying, oh yeah, Dale Earnhardt,

[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.280]
one of those, I don't know the names,

[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.760]
one of those good old boys.

[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.460]
He's here today as riding a Zamboni in between periods.

[00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.640]
He's signing autographs.

[00:25:59.320 --> 00:25:59.980]
All right!

[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.860]
So I think there's a big crossover between that auto racing

[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.060]
and country music.

[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.260]
How about your Garth Brooks likes auto racing a lot?

[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.640]
Here's our one call on the board.

[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.300]
Here's Hollywood.

[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:10.500]
Hello?

[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.020]
Yes, sir.

[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:12.740]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.160]
Okay.

[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.480]
Listen, Neil, I just wanted to know something about Lauren Hill.

[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:16.040]
Yeah.

[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.960]
Technically, she's not a new artist.

[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.780]
She was a member of the Fouji.

[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.720]
She's a group called the Fouji's for about four and a half years.

[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:22.080]
Yeah.

[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.880]
So I don't see how she could have gotten a new artist, so Grammy.

[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:25.440]
Yeah.

[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.100]
And that's all I just wanted.

[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:27.780]
That's all I got, Neil.

[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:28.400]
Okay, thanks.

[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.580]
That's all the audience has today.

[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.060]
So I got more than one week to time.

[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:33.380]

[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:34.760]
Here's a compliment in this week.

[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:35.380]
Let's go on.

[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.640]
We're going on a rough day with the patrons.

[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.220]
One moment.

[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.200]
Here it is.

[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:47.780]
Here it is.

[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.580]
Something is here as well.

[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:49.620]
Oh, my God.

[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.340]
Holy Spirit, airline.

[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.700]
5.670560, 0560, 0560 in a mobile one.

[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.020]
So far, our experience, our second day in the new studios,

[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.400]
I would rate it as an unmitigated disaster, the worst.

[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:06.780]
You know something.

[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.480]
I finally figured out why my breathbone hurts.

[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.800]
You know what it is, huh?

[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.060]
We ended up against the counter.

[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:13.340]
Right.

[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.300]
Remember I mentioned that yesterday at the end of the show?

[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.760]
This is exactly where this what is.

[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.660]
I got wood on my chest.

[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.840]
Well, seriously, the wooden edge.

[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.660]
I mean, maybe if I was sitting in a height here,

[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.080]
how about it?

[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:26.960]
Could this chair raise up?

[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.820]
Because this is not going to fly.

[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.880]
I think it's up all the way.

[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.720]
How about the chair?

[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.760]
This is definitely not going to fly.

[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.680]
Sounds like crap in here.

[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.360]
My breathbone is aching.

[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:37.940]
I'm wondering.

[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.100]
In the last part, I go into bed.

[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:39.880]
I thought, what's that?

[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.120]
Something new and exciting.

[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.700]
I haven't had enough other aches and pains and insect bites.

[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.640]
And all kinds of crap going on in my life.

[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.720]
And then I realize right now I'm sitting here and I'm like

[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.300]
pressed up against the counter.

[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.220]
That's way the hell too high.

[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.960]
Way the hell too high.

[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.180]
How come they didn't have it like up to my neck would have been good?

[00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.220]
Here's plantation.

[00:27:59.500 --> 00:27:59.640]
Hello?

[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.080]
Hey, you need to go back to talk about Frankie Lyman, asshole.

[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:03.640]
Yeah, okay.

[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.600]
Thanks a lot, asshole.

[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:05.820]
Jackass.

[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.880]
Who's the drummer for Frankie Lyman, by the way?

[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.560]
Herde Hanck has today talking about Ringo Star.

[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.460]
Going out in Vegas didn't see the fight.

[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.240]
Nice going Hanck.

[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.660]
And when I had Ringo Star concert and about the top run grin.

[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.760]
By the way, the great song Todd Rungren Han was not the hello.

[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.080]
It's me with the nose.

[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.320]
It was I saw the light.

[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.180]
That was a great record.

[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.840]
Oh, I liked Todd Rungren.

[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.120]
Great.

[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.980]
And then he was talking about the guitarist for a cream was in this group with Ringo.

[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.800]
And I thought the guitarist for cream was Eric Clapton.

[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.360]
But what do I know?

[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.080]
You know, I could be wrong.

[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:33.920]
Huh?

[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:34.760]
Sunshine, your gloves.

[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.760]
And also the drummer from Bad Company.

[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.680]
And then some suck ass calls in.

[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:40.700]
Oh, you know, you're right.

[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.720]
The Ringo Star is really underrated as a drummer.

[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.620]
And I thought to myself.

[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.620]
First of all, like I said last week,

[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.960]
drummers are very rarely once in a great while a drummer.

[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.520]
And most people most of the time you don't even know who the drummer is.

[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.420]
Because the drummer almost always is the guy who is the least musically talented,

[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.180]
like Dennis Wilson in the Beach Boys.

[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.320]
Like Joey Reynolds in Erosmith.

[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.800]
Oh, by the way, speak it of Erosmith.

[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.820]
Finally, heavy, heavy duty.

[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.560]
Finally, after all this time,

[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.720]
I get a CD in the mail from my Columbia record club.

[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.540]
And no, I'm not giving it away and you can't have it.

[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.940]
That I actually want.

[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.060]
A little South of Sanity by Erosmith.

[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.140]
And I usually hate live concert albums.

[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.240]
I can't stand them.

[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.740]
But this one happens to be absolutely sensational.

[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.920]
I want to play that whole thing here today.

[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.440]
Five, and then this phone thing here in this new studio.

[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.040]
Something that could be the audience.

[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.060]
You never know in this town.

[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.160]
But there's something really rotten and Denmark with this crowd.

[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.360]
Maybe we're not capable of getting like more than one line at a time on there.

[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:38.960]
Is that what it is?

[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:44.480]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 50, 50, 50 on the mobile one line.

[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.940]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:46.260]
Hello.

[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.760]
Okay, great.

[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:49.260]
There we go.

[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.380]
That's the material our audience has this week.

[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.600]
Like I said, I love that new Erosmith album.

[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.380]
I'm going to play the whole goddamn thing beginning to end.

[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.080]
22 till 11.

[00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.720]
This is the week in our...

[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.040]
See, this is what Miami does to you.

[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.620]
This is what working in this town will do to you.

[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.580]
We're supposed to be all excited.

[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.060]
We're moving off of the second floor.

[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.220]
We're into our new studios up here with all the other losers.

[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:12.020]
We're up on the third floor with a whole rest of QAM in power 96, et cetera.

[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:12.520]
And so on.

[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.740]
We got nice new walls, newly painted, et cetera.

[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.140]
And there's not a call on the board.

[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:19.940]
Now, let's see.

[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.100]
So far, what do we have so far?

[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.660]
We had the guy making up the story about the cop with the snapshots.

[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.840]
And then we had the guy with the boring chronic guy from Pompo.

[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.940]
And he was so boring, I remember what he had to say.

[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.620]
Then we had the guy, I'm Frankie Lyman, that jackass,

[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.500]
he's beaten his drum.

[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.500]
He's beaten something.

[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:36.860]
And then we get the medical one.

[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:37.220]
That's it.

[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.140]
Four out of four.

[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.340]
Even Joe to Maggio.

[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:40.180]
Never was that perfect.

[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:40.560]
Okay.

[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:41.640]
Even Jolton Joe.

[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:43.680]
5, 6, 7.

[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.740]
I don't even know if these goddamn lines work on this phone up here.

[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.400]
I have my doubts about this all set up.

[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:50.980]
Nice call in there, Greg.

[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.500]
We were kicking ass.

[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.620]
We were doing pretty good downstairs.

[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.440]
We were doing a show every day.

[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:56.860]
I have my doubts.

[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.960]
Now we're going to be able to do the new Roger show on his floor.

[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.380]
Maybe it's being on this floor.

[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.740]
I don't want to mention any names, you know?

[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.940]
Maybe it's like rubbing off.

[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.860]
Something really strange going on in this outfit.

[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:09.500]
21 before 11.

[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.600]
Yeah, my press plan.

[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.800]
I'm wondering what the hell is this?

[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:16.560]
And I realize I'm like sitting here, pressed up against a hard piece of wood.

[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.420]
And by the way, somebody better tell, give Maureen Orth.

[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:21.480]
Call up Tim Russert.

[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.800]
And tell him you want to talk to his wife, Maureen Orth,

[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.500]
I wrote the banana book.

[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:28.320]
She needs some serious instructions about glory holds before she starts writing the book about it.

[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.540]
Put your penis under the stall.

[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.020]
Maybe you can put your penis under the stall, Maureen.

[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.660]
You just want to die.

[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:46.760]
The other night I watched a wrestling match with big, smooth men with sweaty tracks.

[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:54.100]
They would try to grab each other's ass, wearing something more than a tiny g-strap.

[00:31:55.100 --> 00:32:00.060]
But when they rang the bell and the match was over,

[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:07.960]
I couldn't help but notice I had a big boner.

[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.800]
I want to be a wrestler.

[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:11.760]
A wrestler.

[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:12.940]

[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.020]
And have a man's crotch wrapped around my mouth.

[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.200]
I want to be a wrestler.

[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.120]
A wrestler.

[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:19.880]
A wrestler.

[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.620]
And he'll be twisted pushing inside and out.

[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:27.360]
So I admit it seems a little gay.

[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.900]
Fixed my hand between another man's legs.

[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.060]
Oh, and I pull my hands away.

[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.460]
I get to smell my fingers.

[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.560]
You know that other than some time to train,

[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.240]
you don't need to have much of a brain.

[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.920]
As long as it's a shower after you work out,

[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.640]
you don't mind lacing someone's balls in your mouth.

[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:58.940]
I know that white sleeve can be messy and too melty.

[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:05.660]
That's why they like to rub that K-Y on their belly.

[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.040]
Oh, right.

[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.400]
I want to be a wrestler.

[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.600]
And retaining more arms just like you.

[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.800]
I want to be a wrestler.

[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.160]
And maybe run for governor too.

[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.840]
As long as it attracts the crowd,

[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:29.500]
I don't find going down.

[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:34.840]
Rubbish heat diseases are locked with some clumpy queer.

[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:36.640]
That's funny.

[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.760]
He should have done that this week,

[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.740]
because I was talking to somebody in the airport at the MIA

[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:41.080]
the other day before I got on the plane.

[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.640]
And he said, you know, I listen to your show all the time.

[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.420]
And you're absolutely correct about wrestlers.

[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.400]
Even a high school in college wrestlers,

[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.100]
every one of them I've ever known was a flaming queen.

[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.060]
They're the ones that are busy drilling the glory holes.

[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.620]
By the way, got any wrestlers in this building?

[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.060]
They're the ones that are built up,

[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.200]
drilled those two glory holes down a hallway there.

[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:57.960]
Two of them.

[00:33:58.500 --> 00:33:59.700]
Side by side, no less.

[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.780]
I guess we're heavy-do the action, huh?

[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.660]
1046 at 560 WQAM.

[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:06.400]
Yeah, man.

[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.780]
Why doesn't he build a counter like a little bit higher?

[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.240]
Like, so I could rest my chin on it would have been good, huh?

[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.720]
These people in this place, but anyway, you know,

[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:17.560]
they deserve each other.

[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:18.700]
Here's Sunrise.

[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.040]
Hello.

[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.020]
How are you?

[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:20.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.220]
One thing about the new studio, uh...

[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:23.600]
It sucks.

[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.840]
Well, I can hear you better on hold than I did when you were downstairs.

[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:27.640]
Wow.

[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.580]
Mark mostly just stuck his head in the door.

[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.080]
He said, I'll, everything up here sucks.

[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:32.200]
Well, that's baby.

[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:32.560]
What do you think?

[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.840]
But I can hear it better when I'm on hold.

[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:35.960]
Putting the PD, yes?

[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.560]
Um, drummers.

[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.300]
Drummers?

[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.260]
No columns and Karen Carpenter.

[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.660]
Karen Carpenter, yeah.

[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:43.020]
Yeah.

[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.560]
Yeah, she's not that I like.

[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.540]
You know something, if you would have saved the energy from the drumman

[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.140]
and just had another sandwich or two, she might still be a drumman.

[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.360]
She might be taping it.

[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:52.160]
Hey, Kirk Allen.

[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.560]
You know, obviously he's a drummer.

[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:54.800]
Who cares about drummers?

[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.760]
Drummers are like, like I said before.

[00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.520]
And for a guy to call a punk yesterday,

[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.340]
and this caller was just a suckle,

[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.560]
oh, your right, Ringo Star was very underrated.

[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.800]
Ringo Star, number one, was a mediocre drummer at best,

[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.120]
and number two couldn't sing his way out of a paper bag.

[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:09.380]
Number, he's a bubble gum.

[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.620]
I mean, you know, I'm sure that Hank enjoyed the concert

[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.020]
and the group Todd Rungrin's great,

[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.160]
the drummer from a bad company said it was a,

[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:15.840]
that's fine.

[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.200]
But to say that Ringo Star is like a great artist is pathetic.

[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.460]
Attiquate to the task.

[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.460]
Exactly, right, like Dennis Wilson,

[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.860]
who ain't beaten it too well anymore.

[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.740]
You notice how most of the drummers are dead?

[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.220]
Yeah, John Bonham.

[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.340]
What does that tell you?

[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.040]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.320]
I heard about that.

[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.440]
What about that Joey Bishop of the drummer for Erosmith?

[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.120]
No, no.

[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:34.760]
Joey Reynolds.

[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.960]
Yes, him too.

[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.020]
Kirk Allen was, you know,

[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.920]
if you knew anything about Syriol's on video,

[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.120]
you know, you'd be know that Kirk Allen was Superman, of course.

[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.220]
And interestingly, in the Obed, it said that, you know,

[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.900]
he was typecast just like George Rees.

[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.980]
Once he had played Superman, he couldn't get rules with his cell phone.

[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.120]
That's what he said, right?

[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:49.740]
Yeah, you know.

[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.240]
Couldn't get another goddamn rule unless he was putting a have a cape on.

[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.560]
Maybe he could have been Captain Marvel.

[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.860]
He kissed the death, you know.

[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.920]
Right. If he would have just done that to Zan,

[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.860]
he could have been Captain Marvel.

[00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.540]
Yeah, I've one other thought concerning

[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:00.580]
when she talked about he yesterday.

[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.640]
And by the way, before you go on to that,

[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:03.960]
you can see Captain Marvel's story.

[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:03.960]

[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:03.960]

[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:03.960]

[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:03.960]

[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.240]
It says when he was 30, 70,

[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.880]
and this shows you how old I am.

[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.280]
He starred as the Man of Steel Superman in two pictures from Columbia films,

[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:14.380]
Superman in 1948, and Adam Mann versus Superman in 1950,

[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.060]
each was done in a 15-part serial format.

[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:17.120]

[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.800]
And I can remember as a kid and Rochester,

[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.880]
going to the cameo theater every Saturday morning,

[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.200]
and seeing the serum.

[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.680]
And I saw those with the Kirk Allen.

[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.400]
Not that I remember who the hell he was, but I saw those.

[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.240]
That's what I'm all for.

[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.140]
I am in the early days of video when I was first emerging.

[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.520]
Those were one of the first things that were made available.

[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.400]
Yeah, where the serial was on video.

[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:39.160]
But anyway, you were talking about the business about all the old people

[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.160]
that vote on things to repress.

[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:42.460]
Oh, right.

[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:47.600]
It seems to me that the reason is voter apathy.

[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.740]
All the old people are the only ones that turn out on the vote.

[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.340]
That's right, because the rest of the people down here,

[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.420]
they take a look at the people that are offered up and what's going on.

[00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.000]
And we don't want to be involved, including me.

[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.960]
I mean, I'll vote in national elections next year.

[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.960]
But the idea of voting in these local, these parochial, what's the point?

[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:05.780]
They're exactly what I want.

[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.140]
What they use.

[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.840]
They offer up the same direct year in and year out,

[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.100]
and the same incumbents almost always get in with the recognizable names.

[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.020]
And it's the same old parts in the condo.

[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.420]
It's to give them a list, and they all go marching off to the...

[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.520]
Because they got nothing else to do.

[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.540]
A lot of them, they go to the clubhouse in their own condo,

[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:21.320]
and they vote right there.

[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.760]
They don't even have to go off the grounds.

[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.080]
But don't you think if all the people that patronize these clubs

[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.040]
and the young people, like the ones that went to spring break,

[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.460]
who are old enough to vote registered and voted,

[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.000]
there would be more than the condo commandos?

[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:34.440]
No.

[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:35.560]
You don't think so?

[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:35.860]
No.

[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.800]
Because I went to vote on the library issue the other day.

[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.480]
And the library issue?

[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.000]
Well, you know, about the referendum to get the new library improvement?

[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:43.920]
No, I don't know.

[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.900]
Well, this is the election day on the local, whatever.

[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.540]
But I was the only one...

[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:51.760]
I think two people were there, me and a Howard Sharers' officer.

[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:52.380]
Yeah.

[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:53.560]
And this was in the middle of the day.

[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.100]
And normally when you go to an election, or to a polling place on an election day,

[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.700]
most of the people you see there have blue hair.

[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.180]
And like I said, we just go around to the circle.

[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.200]
The rest of us are not going to care about this parochial crap down here.

[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.440]
There's nobody to vote for.

[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:07.080]
There's nobody.

[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.220]
I mean, it's not like Chicago where you got a mayor daily,

[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.580]
or even in New York, where the electors are not Rudy Giuliani,

[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.520]
but we've got a mayor who means something, who makes some decisions,

[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.320]
who's got some powers recognizable.

[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.220]
And this is all crap down here.

[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.400]
You've got all these little municipalities.

[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.860]
Every five blocks is another town.

[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.860]
It's sunrise, and it's a water hill, and it's a Pembroke Pines,

[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:25.620]
and Pembroke Park.

[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.420]
And then there's the one where they won't let anybody out of the age of 100 there,

[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.940]
and an age of Pembroke likes whatever the hell they call that place.

[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:32.000]
It's hopeless.

[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.160]
Well, you know, it's amazing to me when I move down here,

[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.960]
how similar to New Jersey, how Florida is to me.

[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:37.180]
Yeah.

[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.360]
It's exactly like that.

[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.320]
I grew up in New Jersey with better weather and without the smell, right?

[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.560]
I grew up in South Carolina, and there were definite towns.

[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.240]
You know, you drive out of town, you have the sub,

[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.760]
we're going to see trees and things, and then you get to the next town.

[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.100]
Yeah, but I do like the New Jersey Hill.

[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.100]
You cross the street, you're in another community.

[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.660]
I like that Pond View is a restaurant in Cherry Hill.

[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.400]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.040]
Whatever you say.

[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:56.740]
What do you say?

[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.320]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, Pond 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.180]
Plenty of open lines.

[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.620]
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame yesterday.

[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.400]
In fact, they just had his push on here.

[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.420]
Thank God I don't need breakfast.

[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:12.880]
Three singers who dominated radio in 1970s were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame yesterday,

[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.920]
along with Dusty Springfield who died two weeks ago.

[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.740]
Who were the three singers?

[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:17.740]
Paul McCartney.

[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:18.980]
He deserves to be in there, right?

[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:19.540]
Oh, right.

[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:21.740]
Billy Joel.

[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.740]
George likes Billy Joel, by the way.

[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.160]
And Bruce Springsteen.

[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.760]
Absolutely correct.

[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.820]
What did that come from?

[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.900]
Did that come from like in there?

[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.140]
Who hit that?

[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:33.940]
You did.

[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:34.880]
I hit...

[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.180]
Absolutely.

[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.120]
How do you like that?

[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.200]
Both with the same finger.

[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.360]
Must be getting sharper after sticking that through that little hole.

[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:45.400]
How do you like that?

[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:49.100]
Billy Joel, Paul McCartney, and Bruce Springsteen, also inducted,

[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.620]
which for some strange reason it's got way down on the bottom of this article

[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.360]
because they're not as famous Curtis Mayfield,

[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.620]
who already was in the Hall as a member of the Impression.

[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.160]
Now we're talking, they're like a recording artist.

[00:39:59.320 --> 00:39:59.780]
There's a singer.

[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:01.920]
Dell Shannon.

[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:02.440]
All right.

[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.180]
Now we're talking.

[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.920]
Now, I'll do it, Dell.

[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:05.620]
Two ladies.

[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:08.400]
And the gospel group, the staple singer.

[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:08.860]
It's excellent.

[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.740]
Blues artist Charles Brown on the Western Swing Band Bob Wheels and his Texas Playboys,

[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.140]
were on it as early influences, whatever that means.

[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:19.740]
And Beatles producer George Martin was alluded to the non-performing category.

[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:20.940]
How about Brian Epstein?

[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:21.940]
You see in there?

[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:23.600]
We'll see him no more.

[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.260]
That's our topic today.

[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.880]
Dead recording artists, we all love.

[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.500]
Dead drummers that we all they marched to a different drummer.

[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.020]
Here's Holmes dead.

[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:35.280]
Hello.

[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.500]
Good afternoon, sir.

[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:36.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:37.340]
Good evening.

[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:38.880]
Two things, whatever it is.

[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:39.940]
Well, he does it through the eye.

[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:40.760]
Yeah, go ahead.

[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:46.500]
The guy before me was talking about the unhold sound is much, much better.

[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:50.280]
Well, you also forget these people off their ass call and they can actually hear what they're talking about.

[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:50.680]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.500]
It tells wrong with this audience, right?

[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:52.940]
Damn it.

[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.180]
They hate me like poison.

[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:59.160]
No, they can't turn it off, but they will not speak to me for lover money.

[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:04.100]
If I gave him $100 a piece yesterday and today, I still couldn't get these guy's damn phones cranked up these bastards.

[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:05.560]
I'll call back if you can get me a hundred bucks.

[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:05.920]
Okay.

[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:06.560]
Okay.

[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:07.420]
Jimmy Olson dead.

[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:08.920]
Jimmy Olson dead.

[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:10.400]
I can't remember the actor's name.

[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.260]
He was a fag, you know.

[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:11.860]
Yeah, you know.

[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.920]
But it was like, oh, got a year, year and a half ago something.

[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:15.740]
It was the thing in a paper.

[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:20.100]
I think Clark Kent, you know, he kind of looked, uh, anybody that runs around with an outfit like that.

[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:20.440]
That's right.

[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.280]
With the tights and the whole thing.

[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:21.600]
Right.

[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.060]
Jimmy Olson, well, never mind.

[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:23.500]
I know.

[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:24.600]
Second thing, racing.

[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:26.460]
I'm not a race fan.

[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:34.840]
But a bunch of friends of my wife, some people we know down in downtown Holmes dead, they follow the race, uh, NASCAR, whatever the hell, and all these races.

[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.620]
All those crap.

[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:36.320]
Yeah, all the crap.

[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:36.780]
Why?

[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:37.720]
They know, I don't know.

[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.440]
But they know the names of the pit crews of these guys.

[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:41.060]
Huh.

[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.260]
The numbers of sponsors.

[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.880]
They probably even know the name of the drummer.

[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:44.480]
What is it?

[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.140]
Probably true.

[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:45.380]
Yeah.

[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:46.360]
And the breakman.

[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.600]
But that's all I have to offer today.

[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.520]
Who is the name of the drummer for the breakman, by the way?

[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:50.720]
Okay.

[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:51.180]
Thanks a lot.

[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.220]
Now, that's our, okay.

[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:52.780]
Here's the poll.

[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.160]
Which of the following is a real, I'm not talking about playing it.

[00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:58.760]
I'm talking about a spectator sport.

[00:41:59.740 --> 00:41:59.980]
Golf.

[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.020]
Auto racing.

[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.240]
Boxing.

[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.860]
I'm talking about boxing today.

[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:09.440]
And wrestling.

[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.260]
There you go.

[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:11.560]
There are the four for you.

[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:12.000]
That's it.

[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:12.980]
That's a poll, baby.

[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.760]
That's a spectacular poll.

[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.720]
Which of those four is a real spectator sport?

[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.960]
I didn't say spectator sport.

[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.380]
We were putting cock fighting if we did that.

[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.160]
Which one?

[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:24.720]
Golf.

[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:26.000]
Auto racing.

[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:27.400]
Boxing.

[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:28.320]
Boxing.

[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.620]
Oh, gee, it looked like a fake fight to me.

[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:31.240]
It looked fished.

[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.700]
I want my money back.

[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:33.000]

[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:33.000]

[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:33.000]

[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.960]
See, those of you who want to keep getting suckered in, it's like people that order stuff

[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.220]
from infomercials on TV.

[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:44.700]
After you do it, after you get burned, the first, you know, five times, 20 times, a hundred

[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:48.000]
times, you ought to get the message that, hey, maybe when you see something that's being

[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.840]
sold on TV, it's usually a bunch of crap.

[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.800]
Haven't I told you that before?

[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:57.100]
The overwhelming majority of times you buy something on from TV.

[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:57.800]
It's crap.

[00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:58.180]
Right.

[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.400]
For whatever reason, I don't know why TV is so powerful.

[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.520]
You think they want to be under shell and good stuff.

[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:08.520]
But when you're on it, the only thing that I think I might like, because I do like George

[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.700]
Foreman, how do you like that for bustin' up stereo type stuff?

[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:13.760]
A boxer and he's dark-complexed too.

[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.360]
Those who think I'm some kind of a bigot.

[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.080]
Although, thank God we got a white basketball player.

[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.300]
Nice going here, Miami-Vohy.

[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:21.300]
Oh, boy, Wally.

[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.420]
Too many of these in season is named, though, by the way.

[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.260]
But, seriously, I love George Foreman.

[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.800]
And I wouldn't mind having me a lean-mean grill on the machine.

[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:32.840]
In fact, every time that infomercial comes on, I cannot turn it off.

[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.100]
Have you ever seen it?

[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.140]
Even George has seen it.

[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.800]
And he hates boxing, but he likes George Foreman.

[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.280]
I mean, when you see him, you don't take a George Foreman to boxer, because he's what?

[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:43.140]
85 years old.

[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.080]
You think of a fun guy.

[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.380]
He's just a funny guy, you know?

[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:49.820]
It's the lean-mean grill on the machine, baby.

[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:53.840]
And you watch all that fat drip off and all of the feel thinner.

[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:57.260]
Just looking at George Foreman with that big fat head of his, you feel thinner.

[00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:58.120]
Just looking at him.

[00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.280]
And then that brought on there with the crossed eyes, you know, the one that's on every info.

[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.380]
Boy, can you imagine the money that that bitch is making?

[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.440]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.860]
That's always there with Ron Popeel.

[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:07.540]
And I talk about fake.

[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:10.940]
I love the way she always says, oh, and guess who we're lucky enough to have with us today?

[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:14.740]
Even though he's busy, busy, busy, he spent time with us at Ron Popeel.

[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:15.440]
Well, guess what?

[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.220]
It's his infomercial.

[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.520]
He's peddling the crap, okay?

[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.160]
I hate to break the news to your audience.

[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:23.200]
It's his, he's not too busy to do the infomercial, because he's on there to make the money.

[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.780]
Oh, are we lucky to have Ron Popeel with us today?

[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:31.680]
Selling you a 20 cents of plastic, really, 82 easy payments of $39.95 a month or rest of your life.

[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.160]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:34.420]
Hello.

[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.540]
Good afternoon, Neil.

[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:35.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:36.220]
Good evening.

[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.960]
I don't mean to sound redundant, but you do sound terrific even, even, uh, even watching.

[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.000]
Yeah.

[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.280]
So I just want to let you know.

[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.240]
This 30-0 sucks.

[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.840]
So far, I'm sure I'll get used to it if they bring me in a higher chair.

[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.880]
So I'm not sitting with my chin up against the guy.

[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.360]
Maybe that's why, maybe that's why when I came in there, they said,

[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.460]
I'm going to make you your chin up, Neil.

[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:57.720]
Well, that's so Bruce Springsteen and Ringo Starr don't get a band together anytime soon.

[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.080]
Oh, what a thought that is.

[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:00.260]
You know, they didn't even know that.

[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:03.900]
I mean, is there anybody in this audience that really believes that Ringo Starr was a musician?

[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.200]
Well, he had the Beatles that was about it.

[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:09.920]
But he didn't, he didn't have the Beatles they had him.

[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:11.040]
He was along for the ride.

[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.880]
He didn't have, oh, in other words, the Beatles was his group.

[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.320]
I noticed he wrote a lot of that music.

[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:20.580]
Well, if not, if it wasn't for the Beatles, you would never even have heard of Ringo Starr.

[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.080]
That's right. That's exactly right.

[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:23.540]
But I wanted to let you know.

[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:24.920]
But after a poll question, who's more popular?

[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.320]
Kenneth Starr or Ringo Starr?

[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.380]
And who's the better drummer? I think Kenneth Starr.

[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.340]
Their brothers, aren't they?

[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.420]
Yeah, they're joined at the hip.

[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:34.460]
I thought Bruce Springsteen, in some believeable, they put him in the hall of the...

[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:35.140]
Is that pathetic?

[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:35.760]
And they didn't even...

[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.340]
And he is not a singer. He's a croaker.

[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:38.340]
He's a croaker.

[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.440]
They didn't even put the E Street band in there.

[00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.560]
Just Bruce Springsteen because he was with the E Street band after he died.

[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.120]
They didn't even put the money river band in there, whatever the hell that was.

[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.380]
So the E Street band.

[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.540]
The old little old river band.

[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:50.600]
They were more...

[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:51.740]
The E Street band was the...

[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:53.620]
His actual band was more talented than he was.

[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:53.820]
Right.

[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:57.780]
And as far as the real Spurko's, I got to tell you, Neil.

[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.360]
I would vote for professional wrestling before I would vote for boxing.

[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:03.520]
Okay, thank you, sir.

[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.520]
We want your money, though.

[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.240]
We want your money. We've got another big one coming up.

[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.940]
White to late light, Iron Mike back out again.

[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:23.920]
What?

[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.120]
What?

[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:26.640]
What's working?

[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:27.640]
It's beautiful.

[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.080]
And it's bright at all.

[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.400]
And it's all fair.

[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.840]
It's just beautiful.

[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.180]
They throw his phone.

[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.580]
Never touch it.

[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:38.920]
He has a lot of money.

[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:38.920]

[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:38.920]

[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:38.920]

[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:38.920]

[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:38.920]

[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:38.920]

[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:38.920]

[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:38.920]

[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:38.920]

[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:38.920]

[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:38.920]

[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:38.920]

[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:38.920]

[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:38.920]

[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:38.920]

[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:40.560]
You know this.

[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.080]
You know, when you succeed, it's beautiful.

[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:55.460]
And you think that there is going to be an opportunity.

[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.180]
And that time, I didn't...

[00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:58.840]
Enjoy it.

[00:46:58.860 --> 00:46:58.860]

[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:04.260]
Who would stand up to you?

[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:08.900]
And even now I cannot stand up to you.

[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:08.900]

[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:15.900]
It makes me feel fine. It's 16. Oh beautiful and it's mine.

[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.900]
At our fourth question, anybody ever had a more twice the boygan in the interior north?

[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:26.420]
It's the level of three at five, 60 WDQM. So anyway, there's a big ringo star, right?

[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:30.720]
Johnny Burnett. Johnny Burnett, I bet you're dead, huh? You think he's dead?

[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:35.540]
That was the original Id 16. Oh, ringo star, that was his song. No, wrong, sorry.

[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.640]
It's like twist and shout. That was a Beatles song, right?

[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:42.680]
I easily brought this baby. They were great. So anyway, I don't want to dwell on this,

[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.080]
but there's a stupid article in the paper here about teen smoking crackdown losing funding

[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:50.160]
because Governor Butch, Governor Butch says, oh, we don't need the eight and a half million

[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:54.380]
dollars from the cigar from the tobacco companies. They're giving eight and a half million

[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:59.020]
dollars to the state for these programs to crack down for more cops to crack down on teenager

[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:04.240]
smoking. Oh, we don't need that money. Whatever that means. But I want you to listen to the

[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:08.360]
logic in this last paragraph. It says, to Peter Mitchell, marketing director for the state's

[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:13.220]
anti-smoking program, driving up the number of citations given to underage smokers could

[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:18.320]
reinforce the message that smoking is cool. That's why Mitchell, though the budget cut would seem

[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:23.000]
in a front to his campaign, agrees with Butch, Governor Butch. So in other words, based on that logic,

[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:28.100]
driving up the number of traffic citations given would give the impression that speeding is cool.

[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.340]
So therefore, let's stop writing the traffic tickets. Oh, yeah, I thought it was cool.

[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:37.300]
It is. That's why I do it. That's why I got two Corvette's, baby. Oh, it's picking up Corvette.

[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:44.360]
So I had my red Corvette, my 98. I had a little problem, a little break thing.

[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:48.740]
Yeah, plus an oil change, a couple of other things. How did it take it over? Do I dare mention?

[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:52.620]
Well, a friend of mine took it to Ed Morth. I don't want to mention it more, Chevrolet,

[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.800]
because they've been, you know, they've been nice to me over the years. All I do

[00:48:54.800 --> 00:49:00.540]
about my cars and the back road. But nevertheless, so I get my car back yesterday. I get

[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:06.920]
in the car to come to work this morning. And I look at the tire pressure. What? What?

[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:10.140]
It's not only our friends have an executive mobile. Why is it that every,

[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.180]
remember, I brought in the manual at the end. It said, no matter what anybody tells you,

[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:18.420]
if the pulp comes to your house and says, put more than 30 pounds of pressure in each tire,

[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:23.300]
tell them, give them the baff on Google. That's what it said. Don't listen. Remember that?

[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.960]
Very specifically. I mean, language I never heard an instruction manual for a car before.

[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:33.540]
It said, no way, Jose. I just barely leave the house. So in other words, the tires get hotter,

[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:38.260]
obviously the pressure is higher, a couple of pounds. But I had just left. So I'm checking them out.

[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:46.420]
36, 37. Why? And is that is them driving the work? I'm thinking, boy, this doesn't drive the

[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:51.240]
way this car is supposed to drive. It feels like I'm bumper cars, you know? You know what I'm talking

[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:56.420]
about? Look, I'm driving one of those things up at the, what do they call that thing?

[00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:01.240]
You know, up in Danya, go carts. Yeah, like a like that. Yeah. Like one of the, like one of those

[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:05.720]
NAS cars that Joe is going to be talking about. Say anymore, Joe Castellasson. And he does like

[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:10.860]
country music, by the way. You know, like, yeah, you do like country music. He says, I love kids.

[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:14.320]
Maybe that's why he had that Hickey on his arm yesterday.

[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:20.080]
Probably for a more. What's his name? What's the PD from kiss? Bob McKay. Oh, Bob McKay. Oh, George H.

[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.320]
Tim. Like, what is the personal thing? H. Tim. He said he's the biggest asshole in the whole

[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:27.340]
building. That covers a lot of character. He's got a real bad, uh, hair piece too, by the way.

[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:34.580]
Here's Kendall. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay, sir. Anyway, I'm a literature professor here at

[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:39.720]
a college in Miami. And I teach Flannery O'Connor. She's a Southern writer. She deals with racism.

[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:43.320]
I try to push my students, you know, get them offended a little bit. Maybe they'll think.

[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:48.520]
You're offended about one about everything about racism about like people, white people, whatever.

[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:52.300]
Anyways, after class, do you have offended about white people? Yeah. Oh,

[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:59.760]
a lot to be offended of. That student comes after class and says, you remind me of Neil Rogers. Yeah.

[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:05.400]
I didn't know if to be offended or shake his hand profusely. Uh-huh. Can I call him a douchebag? Yeah.

[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:11.660]
For a line, change your name, you douchebag. Okay. Another fake call. Okay, we have an open line in

[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:17.960]
the day one and brown. 5 6 7 0 5 60. Palm 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Another one of your people,

[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:23.020]
a dark and collected the spick. I don't know what he was. How do I know besides the retard? He's a

[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:27.920]
professor, a professor of literature. Have another good one. Okay. Another pop for us.

[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:35.460]
Here's Tamara. Hello. Hey, guys, a professor. Not he's a professor of ass holism, right? You got

[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:41.740]
that. Hey, can I ask a holic? Ask a holic. Can I make a couple comments on your rock and roll stuff?

[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.900]
You thought anything you like, sir? That's what this shows all about. We're sitting here waiting

[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:48.860]
to hear the comments from all our rocket scientists out there and professors of literature. If you

[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:54.140]
don't talk to me, you're going to have to go to another call. Do you have any more? Yes, I do. Okay.

[00:51:54.280 --> 00:52:00.560]
Well, I'm moving on. Um, not many people know us, but Dennis Wilson didn't even play on any beach

[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:05.880]
boys records. Are you serious? Uh, there was a drummer. Are you sure? I am. I'm sure I can tell you

[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:11.280]
who was named. What was his name? His name was Hal Blaine. He played on the records of the beach

[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:17.740]
boys. Jan and Dean, Gary Lewis and the playboys, Johnny Rivers, the fifth and then Jesus. This guy

[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:21.480]
is not in the rock and roll hall of fame. How many of you like that? In other words, he was the

[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:26.740]
stump drummer. Exactly. He's probably played on three or four hundred hit records. This guy.

[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:31.440]
And he is not in the rock. You know who else is not in the rock and the whole thing? And who is that,

[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:35.780]
sir? Billy Joel's in there. We've got all kinds of assholes in the rock. Bruce Springstein,

[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:42.860]
that croaker. Yeah. No gene picnic. Oh my god. 24 hours to toss it. It hurts to be in love.

[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:46.840]
My favorite bracket of all time as of this moment. It hurts to be in love by Gene Pitney. What label

[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:56.720]
did he record for? Oh, black label. That's right. It was black. Want me to tell you? No, give me a

[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:03.640]
mercury. No. You ready? Give me the second letter. You. Music core. That's right. All right.

[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:08.820]
You the man. All right. See, yeah. See, and Tulsa, Gene. He is Eli Liverde. Gene Pitney was great.

[00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:13.780]
Let's do music again. Okay. Let's talk about and let's play a lot of a dental kill some good

[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:20.120]
time. Favorite drummers? Who is the better drummer? Gene Crupe or Ringo Star? Buddy Rich or Dennis Wilson?

[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:27.900]
That's our poll question. Oh, no. No, but he can sing like sting. Certainly not.

[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:34.180]
Jimmy Stewart. Now he proves it on this new album, Stewart Sing Sting. Rocks, Sam.

[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:43.960]
Yeah, don't have to. You don't have to. It doesn't. What do you like him show?

[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:50.000]
Yeah, so you'll get great hits like King of Soup. Message in a bowl of soup. Soup in the material

[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:57.340]
world and don't stand so close to the astronomy. That's Stewart Sing Sting. So good. You want to listen

[00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:03.320]
to it with a fork? What do you? Oh, yeah. I said it wasn't. I read you. I was lucky. Jimmy Stewart

[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.880]
died, but he did. He could have been the next Campbell soup. Spokesman. You know, remember that

[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:10.140]
Luther Campbell chunky soup? Huh? He was in the soup, heavy. And now he's in the soup.

[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:15.800]
It's 1114 at 560 WQM. Do I sound a little bit different now? I feel like a little child on a

[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:20.740]
high chair because Joe Costello just came in here practicing for his big NASCAR show. He said,

[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.540]
I bet you that's your like go zooming way up in the sky and sure enough,

[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:29.380]
reach down the lever down there and give it a little crank and look at that. Right up in the sky.

[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:34.380]
I'm on top of the world like here in Carpenter. Look how she's doing. Huh? I feel like an idiot. I

[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:39.780]
feel like I'm sitting here like to spend an animation here way up in the air. But it's better than

[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:42.780]
sitting here with my breathbone pressing against the hard one. A hard piece of wood.

[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:50.540]
Here's a mobile in for the outer day. Hello. Okay. Thank you. Here's a mobile in. That was

[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:58.320]
a Bruce Brinston Cronin mobile in Naples. Hello. Mobile in Naples. Okay. Nice talking to you. Okay.

[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:04.840]
That opens up several lines. Like about 200. 560. 560. 560 out of 18 T wireless line.

[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:10.340]
Here's a mobile in Kendall. Hello. You sure that a mobile in Milan? What is it?

[00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:16.500]
Was that Florida or whatever it is? Go ahead. Take your piece. Do something. The best drummer of all

[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:22.740]
time team. Yeah. Think of the best drummer in the world. Great. Thank you. See what I'm saying

[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:27.320]
about this crowd? Who cares about the drummer? The drummer is relatively insignificant. Okay.

[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:34.820]
Who gives a rats answer about the freaking drummer? 560. 560. 560 on the 18 T wireless

[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:41.400]
line. Mobile in for a lot of day. Hello. Dale. Yes, sir. You're insulting Gene Crumpet by

[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:48.020]
comparing them to Ringo. Sure. Sure. I was. It was a joke. Okay, sir. I hate to

[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:53.840]
break the news. Yes, sir. It was just a little joke. Yeah, but it seems important to listen to

[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:57.300]
the same thing. Sing with Benny Goodman. Come on. I don't want to hear Benny Goodman. Okay.

[00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:03.640]
I know the wrong thing. I'm not interested in Benny Goodman. Okay. See you. Okay. See you. Okay.

[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:09.500]
That's what we got now. The old farts calling in. Great. Just what I wanted. 560. 560. Have

[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:13.440]
another pop. There you go. Have it. I don't know. How's Benny Goodman doing? See name lately?

[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:19.980]
560 on the 18 T wireless line. I'm serious, man. What? Why did I bother coming in here yesterday

[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:24.440]
to commemorate the opening of our new studios here on the third floor where everything is all

[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:29.000]
screwed up where the levels on the overhead are going like from non-existent yesterday to like

[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:33.400]
worst whatever the hell they are today. I'm sitting here with now I'm in a high chair.

[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:37.740]
Like a like a five-year-old in the goddamn high chair and you know something talking to this

[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:42.580]
audience, it fits in perfectly too. It's appropriate. Because that's the level of the calls we've had

[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:48.120]
so far yesterday and today. Here's the North Miami Beach. Hello. Hello, I'm Goodleel. Yes, sir.

[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:53.220]
Pretty pissed Dutch boy here. How are you? Okay. Driving noise on the elder road. The stupid

[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:58.540]
police cop just pops me. So it's going 15 miles to fast. 150 bucks to take it as a

[00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:05.220]
ridiculous. I'm only going 12. He's not 15. I said $148 for just 15 miles. He said, yeah,

[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:11.320]
that's I don't make the prices. And my dealership calls up two minutes later. She's, oh yeah,

[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:18.920]
we fixed the time belt and you walk is about $550. $50 on parts and $300 million in labor.

[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:25.220]
Yeah, well, let me give you three words to solve all these problems. Just pay it. 5, 6, 7,

[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:29.520]
05, 60, 05, 5, 60 on the end. The words of the immortal Ralph Negro, the major deities,

[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:34.400]
passed away at Pompidle Park and was there for many, many years. Just pay it. Anybody remember that?

[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:40.700]
That line? Here's a mobile and Davy. Hello. Yeah, oh, it's all got. Okay. Okay,

[00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:43.780]
well, I forgot to listen to him this morning. By the way, anybody here in area yet? No.

[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:47.660]
Forget about that. Maybe this guy could have told us if he wasn't doing this sit down comedy routine.

[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:55.800]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T line. Need some reneary spy reports. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[00:57:57.180 --> 00:58:02.500]
Bye, everybody. Glory. No, brother. No more your people on here. Okay, I've been trying to

[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:07.680]
tell you that for how many months, now eight months, no more of your people. Please. We've already heard

[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:12.680]
it put it on a record pal. Okay, and stick it. It's like a stuck record. So stick it. Here's a

[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:17.000]
mobile in Miami. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. About John Stamos for the Beach Boys.

[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:22.200]
John Stamos with the Beach Boys. He was their best drummer.

[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:26.260]
Stamos was his Blackie. He played the drums with the Beach Boys. I think you're right.

[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:32.520]
What about him? Okay, John Stamos. Blackie. Okay.

[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:41.480]
But he's right. Here's a mobile in Palm Beach. Hello. Yes, sir.

[00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:46.580]
Neil, do you know who the world's greatest, who's rated the number one world's greatest guitarist?

[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:50.520]
Read it down in the room. Well, what does that mean the world's greatest guitarist?

[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:54.500]
There was a thing on the AT&T the other night about rock and roll and guitarist.

[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:58.320]
Please don't tell me you're a cleft and please don't say that. No, no, that's not what I was going to say.

[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:03.720]
It's Roy Clark. Yeah. Oh boy, he can pick it. Yeah. That's hard to believe.

[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:10.360]
I've got to know like that. That's the third night. But I was amazed at that. I figured it would be

[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:15.480]
first of all, how do you how do you compare? It's like it's like the 100 best movies I was talking

[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:20.780]
about this last week or the 100 greatest recording artists. How do you compare? Well, that list was

[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:24.400]
pathetic. The movie was the last thing. Right. Yeah, that was completely incredible. Roy Clark.

[00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:30.740]
That's what that's what they're saying. Yeah. I don't know if I buy it or not. Okay, well,

[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:37.080]
I'm not buying it. Thank you. 5 6 7 0 5 60, pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a mobile

[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:43.200]
in Bokeh. Hello. This is Roy Clark. He's a nose picker. How you doing? I'm from the

[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:47.080]
else. Not too good. You're like, you're not doing good. No, I don't. I don't like the new studio.

[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:51.300]
I don't like these last two shows yesterday and today. I hate these phone calls. I can't stand

[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:55.660]
this place, but other than that, it's great. Is this studio? Okay, I don't get technical. No, it's not

[00:59:55.660 --> 01:00:03.580]
okay. The cold counter was built like two inches too high. Really? Yeah. But the choice is either

[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:07.660]
sitting up here in a most uncomfortable with like a little kid in a high chair or else putting it

[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:11.960]
back down again to the other position where it's banging up against my chin and my breastbone.

[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.620]
I'm just going to have to stretch it. I'm going to have to stretch it, right? Listen, I had the car

[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:20.160]
just heard their last car about a ticket. I got nail display on 70 Nightsford right now from

[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:27.260]
Neil IOD. Yeah. Like 42 right there at 35. Yeah, I'll slow down. Okay. Here's a mobile in sunrise. Hello.

[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:34.080]
I knew I already. Okay. Just go back from vacation. Just wanted to say you sound great. No, yeah.

[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.800]
23 years I've been on the earnest town yesterday and today the two worst shows of all time.

[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:45.740]
Well, we're not even halfway done today. We're done, but we're not halfway there.

[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:52.560]
You sound great, babe. Yeah. And just wanted to say that Jolton Joe is left and gone away. Left

[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:57.580]
and gone away and none too soon. Absolutely. And was still just as ugly as death as he was when he

[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:05.060]
was a teenager. Thank you. 567.0560. 05.60 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a mobile in what is that?

[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:09.940]
Orlando. Well, Neil. Yes, sir. You are God. I got to tell you that.

[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:15.340]
The reason I'm calling you is because I know you don't put up with mediocrity. Are you ready for this?

[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:20.260]
I'm more. I know put up with mediocrity. Look where I work. Well, you call it though. You don't

[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:26.580]
just let it go. And now that's what I'm doing here with Fox's NHL on Sunday between the periods

[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:31.280]
that put that bimbo on who doesn't even know how to pronounce the names of the player. They don't

[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.660]
care about it because they're dumping it off anyway. This is their last year. They get rid of it.

[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:39.720]
Yes, he is going to take it and then they don't care. God, well, I'm glad to hear that because I was

[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:46.620]
just going out of my epic mind when she's talking about the Dan Oh. Yeah. And all these players and

[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:50.200]
just this pronounce it ridiculous. Well, thanks. You care to see later by.

[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:57.880]
567.0560. Yeah, I'm going to tell you one thing. I can't. I rather I'm going to put the

[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:05.080]
chair back down. I mean, that's that's just ridiculous. One moment, please. How can I get it? Oh,

[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:11.440]
I see. It's like a graduate. You have to hold it. You have to squeeze it and the 11 or two.

[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:15.120]
So now this little bit. Yeah, there you go. That's a little bit better. I'm going to like have to

[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.580]
adjust the head of my chair. Nice going there, George. Of course, so that is not you.

[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:25.680]
Here's a mobile in Miami Beach. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing, man? Okay. All right.

[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:29.620]
Now, I hear you talking about music and one band that I didn't hear you talk about was KISS.

[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.640]
Why do you think that? Yeah, because we're talking about music.

[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:36.700]
They've been around for 26 years, man. Yeah. So is cancer.

[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.460]
All right. Leprosis has been around a lot longer than that. Okay. So I take it. You don't like that. No,

[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:46.900]
I do not. No. And by the day should have been the wall. I don't even like KISS radio or

[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:51.880]
assistant station because I don't like those picking music. Oh, right. Bob McKay. All right. How we

[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.600]
get that? Okay, back to you. Here we go again. They're starting this. This is what we should have

[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.720]
stayed on for the rest of the year. Oh, yeah, we should have stayed on the music thing to the rest of

[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:04.180]
the year because they have no other material. That's all they know from 5 6 7 0 5 60,

[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:09.740]
pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. I mean, we've already, we've already exposed the fact that

[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:14.100]
all high school and college restless are fags and that golf is a real pussy sport that nobody,

[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:20.060]
nobody who's a real man or even a real woman watches golf. The women at watch golf are bull likes.

[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:25.120]
They want to watch other bull likes play golf and bat balls around. And the men at watch golf are

[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:31.160]
just lifeless pathetic sand creatures. I have no idea what how to describe them. Watching other

[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:36.400]
people play golf. Oh, there's a great nine iron. Look at that. Wow. Ernie L's just made the

[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:42.520]
shot of a lifetime. Look at that. Now they're all schlepping up the fairway. Oh, brother. And

[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:48.720]
here's a mobile in Pembert Pine. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I know you're the one talking about

[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:56.420]
music. It's kind of before. But he was right. Roy Clark is one of the best guitarists. If not

[01:03:56.420 --> 01:04:00.900]
the best guitarist. I'm very happy for him. I'll send him a congratulations. Oh, very, very good.

[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:05.480]
Classical walk and roll. He can play anything. But the man is a great, great, great, great

[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:13.320]
mission. He's a badic for Roy. Well, nice going. Roy. Okay. Yeah. That's all. Okay. Thank you. Okay.

[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.940]
5 6 7 we're almost at the end, baby. I thought that we were only about halfway done. We're pretty close

[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:24.300]
to the end of this, baby. 5 6 7 0 5 60. Tom 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a mobile in Pembert

[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:30.520]
Pine. Hello. Hi, Neil. How you doing? Oh, not too good, sir. Another one. Great days. That's too bad. I

[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:35.820]
just had to ride up like a big fat shriveled prune and just dried up and died. Oh, I remember that

[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:40.060]
song. American pie. The day the music died. This is the day Miami died. Well, I got to remember

[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:47.000]
it was an intensive care today. It's officially big. Oh, go ahead. I got some interesting facts about

[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.600]
Gene Pintney. Yeah. I don't know if you know, but he initially was called Billy Gland. He wasn't

[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:58.760]
Gene Pintney. Well, he first started out. Yeah. And also he was known as Rockville Rocket because he

[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:03.300]
was from Rockville, Connecticut. And I happen to be one of his distant cousins and I played in a

[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:08.880]
high school band with him and played at trumpet. No, it's May 1858. Is he alive? Yes, he is.

[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:16.560]
He's alive in Summers, Connecticut. He owns a little beach beach that is open to the public.

[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:23.900]
He lives in a beach? Well, yeah, it's a small beach. It's had a lake. It's a

[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:29.560]
Christmas lake and he owns a beach there and it has a little pavilion and he has the answers there.

[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:36.000]
I've been to Connecticut. You don't have beach time too often. So it's like a seasonal thing.

[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:42.360]
It goes from May to September and that's it. But I just thought you'd be interested. I enjoy

[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:45.800]
your show and I live in Florida now. I'm not going to make sure that. Oh, here.

[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.100]
Okay, well, thanks a lot, pal. Say how did you give him a big kiss for us? Okay,

[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:53.560]
come it only hurts for a little while. I can't let it. Here's the putt.

[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:59.940]
There we come and don't miss a new punty thing. Twenty-two.

[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:05.040]
I break the choir. The Hayesha la Crupta USA. What's in corner? What's in this right here?

[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:10.260]
The sky and valley. Who? There's a bunch of queers again this year who say that I wish to. Oh,

[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:15.800]
God loves the A-Wish and let's just parts your game. If the area won't be marked in a punty thing,

[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:21.200]
you can be above my bucket of stones. Sure, and that's okay, but it has to be a

[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.180]
worship to me.

[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:30.160]
Now you ought to have a party in both eminences. Three have delivered this pronouncement upon

[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:36.980]
the blessed day. Sure, a little bit of heaven fall and nestled in the sea.

[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:45.200]
What's your cornstrap to help a home of actuality? Oh, God loves the A-Wish and let's

[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.960]
support today. That's what their pronouncement tells the face to you in the face.

[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:54.160]
You can be a corner, ma mia darn. God loves you anyway. But you can't see A-Wish

[01:06:54.160 --> 01:07:03.240]
it today. Oh, L-E-S-B-A-A-N-N-S-B-L-E-N. Choose another

[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:15.320]
Whim and part are made with who develop and can ever get to taste with? L-E-S-B-I-A-A-N-N-S-B-A-N-S-B-C-A-N.

[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.800]
It's the shame that detailed ones will come out and march with us

[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:22.920]
That's the end. No way. The Chuset's pardonable honor.

[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:28.140]
It's your to such a straight. It boils like the Kennedy's that made this country brief.

[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.320]
We won't allow nobody to pardon the word of the green.

[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.880]
And when we say up to Irish boys, that is what it means.

[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:40.320]
Oh, God, that's the Irish, as long as it's been again.

[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:43.640]
It's a perhaps the number of times we've never been sure of them.

[01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:46.680]
You can be seen in wrongs and hurl and chumps will laugh it all away.

[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:49.400]
But you can't be English if you're gay.

[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.720]
No, you can't be English if you're gay.

[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:56.120]
Long, even, try a B and I, you should be gay.

[01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:59.120]
I'm a 40 years in the business boys and girls.

[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:01.040]
And I'm suffering my first radio injury.

[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:04.900]
They should tell you about Greg Reed and the Beasley-Greed people about their confidence.

[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:08.940]
A bruised breastbone. That's what I got.

[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:12.740]
From... I... Lawsuit sounds good to me.

[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.000]
Sounds like a major, major lawsuit.

[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.360]
In fact, I'm having trouble breathing.

[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.620]
All kinds of problems.

[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.360]
From a bruised God, the breastbone.

[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.240]
Why wouldn't they build it the same height as the one downstairs,

[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.880]
which there was no problem with that at all?

[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.940]
It was fine. It was just fine.

[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:29.100]
That's the carpenter, dude.

[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:31.380]
Richard?

[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.080]
Here's a mobile in the Gables. Hello.

[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:37.620]
Hello, Neil.

[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.340]
Yes, sir. I'm the hell are you?

[01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:39.780]
Okay.

[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:41.380]
Here's a meeting at the Toronto.

[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:42.620]
Sometime I'm nailing my wife.

[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:43.680]
You what?

[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.220]
I'm hitting out to Toronto.

[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.140]
Yeah. You always talk about it.

[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.680]
It's a great place to go and visit.

[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:49.100]
Yes.

[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.740]
What do you recommend to do out there?

[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:51.740]
What do I have to do out there in May?

[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.160]
Is it cold?

[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:55.580]
In March 16. Of course it's cold.

[01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:57.260]
It's like 38 degrees for the high today.

[01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.300]
No, not in March. I'm sorry in May.

[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:00.380]
Oh, in May?

[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:01.440]
Yes, sir.

[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.800]
I won't be that bad. It'll be like it is up north in May.

[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.620]
Is what it'll be like.

[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:05.700]
It'll be like in the 50s.

[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:06.740]
Maybe 60s if you're lucky.

[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:07.340]
60s.

[01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.920]
65, 62, 61 and a half.

[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:11.640]
How's the nightlife out there?

[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.180]
Great.

[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:14.940]
That's a great, fantastic.

[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:15.900]
Great.

[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:18.100]
Compared to here, spectacular.

[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:24.020]
Now, I think the day life, the afternoon life, the nightlife, the morning life, the subway,

[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:26.460]
the, you name it.

[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:30.500]
Someone was telling me that they have a lot of our feeder out there and it's the biggest

[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.180]
in New York but not as dirty as New York City.

[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:32.800]
You're right.

[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:34.400]
Well, the city is no.

[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:35.860]
The city is 4 million people to Toronto.

[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:36.960]
Oh, okay.

[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:37.540]
Yeah.

[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.180]
And a lot of big shows up there.

[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.320]
They have the pantages to be able to feed her up there.

[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:43.460]
They got all kinds of stuff.

[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:45.060]
You love it.

[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:46.380]
Is it a great balance?

[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:46.660]
Is it a great balance?

[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:47.880]
Which is a dollar in the Canadian money?

[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:48.720]
No, it's fantastic.

[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:51.400]
You've got a buck and a half or every American dollar.

[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:52.520]
You get a buck and a half Canadian.

[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:53.900]
It's a great value for Americans.

[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:54.740]
Oh.

[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.460]
I guess that's what I'm adding for.

[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:56.740]
All right.

[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:57.340]
Have a great time.

[01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:58.760]
I'll be leaving right now if I were you.

[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:00.520]
You like to have the loonies and the tunies?

[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:05.900]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.380]
It's a real city unlike here.

[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:12.820]
The real city with like a real visible downtown and a real identifiable place.

[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000]
And like, hey, here it is.

[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.060]
We're all like a part of this.

[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.220]
And supposed to hear like, you know, you know, these assholes that say,

[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.140]
the reason I like to live in here so much is the cultural mix.

[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:27.960]
Like, like, first of all, there's anything so unusual about living in a big city that's not like all the same culturally.

[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.960]
Like, there's something novel and unique about that.

[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:35.040]
One of the reasons I can't stand this place is because the cultural mix is the wrong one.

[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.060]
But the good news is, wait till you hear this.

[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.800]
All these people that were psychotic about the Orioles playing in Cuba.

[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:43.580]
Now, most of the people here haven't learned this yet.

[01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:45.280]
This is, keep this undercover.

[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:45.760]
It's okay.

[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:46.780]
Don't let the news out.

[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:51.660]
But when the Orioles go down to Havana to play baseball down there against the Cuban National Team,

[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:55.060]
they're taking about 80% of the Cubans from here in South Florida with them

[01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:56.540]
and they're bringing only one way ticket.

[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.480]
They're not letting them back in.

[01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:58.740]
Yeah!

[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:03.540]
I just thought, you know, don't spread the news because some people start getting panic, you know.

[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:06.480]
And those Spanish language stays, they're, they start carrying on in there.

[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.820]
They're leaving and they're not coming back.

[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.880]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:16.140]
Neil.

[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:16.680]
Yes, sir.

[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:22.720]
You know how athletes retire at a certain age when they're just getting, you know, too old.

[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:23.220]
Yeah.

[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:25.020]
They should do that for musicians.

[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:28.280]
We saw art garfant go at Gulf Stream.

[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:28.720]
Bad?

[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:31.420]
Bad isn't even a good word.

[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:35.400]
It was the most embarrassing or formidable performance ever.

[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:35.980]
Oh my God.

[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:37.340]
You got to know when to hang it up.

[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:41.700]
You can't be an idiot like Stan Musil and keep playing like two years, three years after you should hang it up.

[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:45.380]
But the highlights for me was me singing where have you gone, Muhammad Ali?

[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:45.920]
Yeah.

[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.400]
How many syllables?

[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:48.220]
Muhammad?

[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:49.720]
Well, Muhammad.

[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.640]
Is that the right?

[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:52.580]
Joe, they're mad.

[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:53.280]
You're right.

[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:54.240]
It's that.

[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.400]
It just doesn't fit right.

[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:56.540]
Cash is playing.

[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:57.020]

[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.780]
By the way, I'm sorry that we're back in music, but the best two syllables.

[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:01.960]
Stan, he was dumb.

[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:02.700]
Don't hang up.

[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:04.580]
Almost that's two bands of all time.

[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:06.760]
Genesis and yes, bar none.

[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:07.400]
No.

[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:08.920]
Genesis and?

[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:09.220]
No.

[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:10.180]
Yes.

[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:10.700]
No.

[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:11.560]
Yes.

[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:12.560]
No.

[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:13.800]
Thanks Neil.

[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:14.320]
No.

[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:14.780]
Okay.

[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.140]
The best band of all time, it's not even a contest.

[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:19.260]
No, you kidding me.

[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:22.420]
You can't understand what's wrong with a musician.

[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:23.300]
It must be this town.

[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.320]
It would need to be a debate about this in a real city.

[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.560]
You think we're going to a nurse?

[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.080]
What?

[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:30.180]
What?

[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:31.220]
It's you.

[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:32.560]
It's you.

[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:32.840]

[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:34.020]
It's you.

[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:34.540]
It's you.

[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:34.780]

[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:35.620]
Oh, that's right.

[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:37.080]
I'm the one who's out of the stand.

[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:37.660]
That's it.

[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:39.780]
And all these people are more asked that by.

[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.660]
They know what music's all about.

[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:42.180]
That's right.

[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:43.600]
And yes.

[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.060]
Yes.

[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:45.580]
No.

[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.020]
Is this the greatest group of all time?

[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:47.340]
No.

[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:47.800]
No.

[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:48.300]

[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:48.840]
No.

[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:49.380]
No.

[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:50.160]
No.

[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:50.360]
No.

[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:50.700]
No.

[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:51.160]
No.

[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:51.220]
No.

[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:51.940]
No.

[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:53.100]
No.

[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:54.500]
No.

[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:56.960]
No.

[01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.420]
No.

[01:12:59.700 --> 01:12:59.940]
No.

[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:00.060]

[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:00.260]

[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:02.220]
No.

[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:02.320]

[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:02.520]

[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.760]
Well, congratulations.

[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:07.620]
Get alive.

[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:09.480]
Congratulations.

[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:10.200]
I'm in T.

[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:11.360]
Good.

[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:12.100]

[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.320]
Anybody down to your oesmith is the best group of all time.

[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:15.320]
Your taste is in your...

[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.040]
Your taste is in your rectum, okay?

[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:19.000]
It's way, way inside there.

[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.980]
Like about where the roids start growing, you know, before they pop out and get real dark purple.

[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.440]
Oh, dark purple, we like them too.

[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:30.200]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, and pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:32.700]
Here's a hope sound.

[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:33.020]
Hello.

[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:35.840]
Hope sound.

[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:36.280]
Hello.

[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:36.940]
Yes, sir.

[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.000]
Neil, I listened to you last couple of days.

[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:41.840]
I'm new to the area.

[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:44.680]
I wonder if you can take it as well as you give it.

[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.120]
Which means what, sir?

[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:47.000]
You have got...

[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:47.820]
I'm new to the area.

[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:52.220]
You're new to the area, but obviously you want to give me, you want to analyze my show and tell me how to do it.

[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:55.040]
And analyze all everything that's going on here, is that it?

[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.420]
I want to tell you what a disgusting human being is.

[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:58.620]
So why are you listening to it?

[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.660]
Because I wanted to see if my hearing was that bad.

[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:03.540]
Well, maybe you've got a little bit of a problem, sir.

[01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.520]
Maybe at your age, at your advanced age, you've got a little bit of a hearing problem.

[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:07.060]
Is that possible?

[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:07.300]
No.

[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:08.760]
I'm not bad at it.

[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:11.540]
Well, why don't you find something useful to do between these hours of ten?

[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:12.740]
I think this is very useful.

[01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:13.860]
You have a life...

[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:16.920]
I think this call is about as useful as partying in a wind storm.

[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:17.460]
Okay, sir?

[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:18.540]
That's how useful it is.

[01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:19.500]
That's what you're refunding, though.

[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:20.340]
Yeah, far...

[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:20.900]
That's what we're doing.

[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:23.140]
That's how it's called partying in a wind storm.

[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:23.960]
You want to hear it again?

[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:25.240]
There is another one for you.

[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:25.600]
Okay.

[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.000]
Out of here, you old prune.

[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:29.380]
Just what we need is another old fossil coming down here.

[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:31.340]
Who's got so much to do.

[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.920]
This guy has got such an active life down here now that he's going to take time.

[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.680]
It's very important and instructive.

[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:43.420]
Sir, I've heard from a million punks like you, old punks, you know, over the age of 85, old farts like you over the years.

[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:45.580]
And I'm still here going strong, okay?

[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:49.880]
And long after they stick your ass in the ground and your goddamn pushing up daisies

[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:53.520]
and the worms are eating your flesh, you're rotting, disgusting, putrid flesh,

[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:58.000]
I'll still be here going strong, raking down some very serious bucks day in and day out, okay?

[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:00.340]
Long after your history.

[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:02.900]
After they stick you in the ground head first.

[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:03.900]
I have no life.

[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.300]
You have no penis.

[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:21.020]
I just used to take a boy.

[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:27.620]
They often come off of my hippie's yuck.

[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:32.500]
So you know that's the right path.

[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.860]
Well, I just had life.

[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:55.700]
I just had life.

[01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:07.680]
I just had life.

[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:07.760]
I just had life.

[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:13.080]
I just had life.

[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:23.340]
I just had life.

[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:28.760]
I just had life.

[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:54.280]
I just had life.

[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:56.620]
I just had life.

[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:26.320]
I just had life.

[01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:26.580]
I just had life.

[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:31.100]
I just had life.

[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:40.380]
I just had life.

[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:05.040]
I just had life.

[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:10.340]
I just had life.

[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:21.800]
I just had life.

[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:40.320]
I just had life.

[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.240]
I just had life.

[01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:54.500]
I just had life.

[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:21.980]
I just had life.

[01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:23.380]
I just had life.

[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:23.400]
I just had life.

[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:29.360]
I just had life.

[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:38.240]
I just had life.

[01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:53.360]
I just had life.

[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:13.380]
I just had life.

[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:19.740]
I just had life.

[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.540]
I just had life.

[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:49.620]
I just had life.

[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:50.540]
I just had life.

[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:51.200]
I just had life.

[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:58.640]
I just had life.

[01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:00.080]
I just had life.

[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:00.800]
I just had life.

[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:20.800]
I just had life.

[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:25.040]
I just had life.

[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:29.480]
I just had life.

[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:29.500]
I just had life.

[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:46.960]
I just had life.

[01:21:46.960 --> 01:22:15.960]
I just had life.

[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.080]
I just had life.

[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:39.600]
I just had life.

[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:45.540]
I just had life.

[01:22:45.540 --> 01:23:03.980]
I just had life.

[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:31.480]
I just had life.

[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:33.020]
I just had life.

[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:46.240]
I just had life.

[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:02.320]
I just had life.

[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:29.100]
I just had life.

[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.280]
I just had life.

[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.560]
I just had life.

[01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:39.700]
I just had life.

[01:24:50.800 --> 01:25:06.780]
I just had life.

[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:11.380]
I just had life.

[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:14.220]
