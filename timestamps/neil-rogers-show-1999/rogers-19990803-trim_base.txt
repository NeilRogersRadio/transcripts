And he won't come down because he loves his tools with strawberry peel.

[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:46.740]
He's making drug deals as long as he can hit about strawberry snacks that forever.

[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:59.160]
Now when he's swinging his strike three, how's that he must be high on blow?

notice he's not wearing his Yankee outfit today thank God for that that would be a

[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.960]
bad day to be wearing that thing today on a disgraceful day in which

[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.680]
commissioner Bud Light is Hank calls him Bud Light piece of turd a

[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.000]
thing the union oh yeah that's right you got to give another 20 or 30 chances

[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.180]
you got to get him back in there okay whatever you say so I get a letter

[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.180]
yesterday from the post office see this is a this is probably of no interest

[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.980]
to 99% of the people in the audience but I really don't care because I'm

[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.020]
looking for it just easy so I don't have to make a call out it's easier to

[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.900]
take calls coming in no and your postal customer this is about my I have one

[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.240]
of those pitney pose postal meters which is a lot easier with all the damn

[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.160]
bills I have to pay in Senate of five six seven thousand bills that I have to

[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.560]
pay every month so I like my postage meter but nevertheless I record

[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.180]
indicate that postage meter number so and so it's registered to you and is

[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:05.160]
overdue for the required examination I may go to jail before this

[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.200]
day is out an annual meter examination by a postal employee is mandatory for

[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.560]
meters that are separately via telephone the purpose of the examination is to

[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.020]
ensure that the meter is in satisfactory condition to protect your interest

[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.740]
and that of the postal service in the event of a malfunction at your

[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.780]
junction the required exam is based on the anniversary day of the meter your

[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.620]
meter was due for the annual exam June 25th 1998 I'm over a year late for

[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.500]
Christ's sake please take your meter in this letter to your nearest post office by

[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.360]
August 11th 99 for the examination and it's got a whole thing that they have

[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.000]
to fill out here on the bottom my answer is I'm not taking I mean the whole

[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.300]
purpose of getting that is so you don't have to go to the post office examine

[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.220]
what what are they going to examine that's probably it probably to take your

[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:52.300]
postage meter to the post office and the guy says bend over please yeah sticks

[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.900]

[00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:00.260]
me how do you like that so maybe somebody can and because it seems to me I

[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.920]
called the pitney most people last year when I got a similar kind of a notice

[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.280]
and I said what the hell is this about now I don't worry about that it doesn't apply to you

[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.300]
huh they're very nice and very convenient but not exactly worth going to the

[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.680]
Pokey for if you catch my drip so maybe we have some postal nerd in the

[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:19.720]
audience who can inform me what to do about that where to stick it play like men

[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:26.320]
and they look like women how young is too young

[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:40.480]

[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.380]

You and your friends are me

[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.500]
She lives 25 but she's just that

[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.920]
How young you two young?

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.320]
Perfectly

[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.360]
I've been my last of three

[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.380]
Daddy called the cosmonaut

[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.120]
Oh

[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.340]
My best off perfection is

[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.240]
Because I have to tell me

[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.640]
I'm a maca

[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.300]
Catch by me

[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:50.960]
Rrr

[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.520]
I was just saying

[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.120]
What am I?

[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.380]
Of my soul

[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.020]
Black dumb

[00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.420]
She's a jerk

[00:11:59.240 --> 00:11:59.660]
She's okay

[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:00.980]
She's a jerk

[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:01.680]
She's fine

[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.360]
She should be scared of ser

[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:05.840]
You're the number

[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.100]
She's a friend

[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.660]
They're the type of guy

[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.740]
She's a guy

[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.180]
She's a demon

[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.940]
She lives 25

[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.080]
She lives 25 but she's just that

[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.060]
By the way, tell Bokobrine

[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.500]
A step away from our facts

[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.860]
You know, don't rip that up

[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.520]
Why not that?

[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:26.140]
Why?

[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:26.860]
We need that

[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.020]
But why couldn't you brought this here?

[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:28.940]
It was just here yesterday

[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.220]
The thing wasn't working yesterday

[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.540]
The thing wasn't working yesterday

[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.200]
From when I hear that wasn't the first day

[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.020]
The thing wasn't working

[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.600]
In fact, I hear more days often than not

[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.400]
However that goes

[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.940]
So we aren't going to get any information

[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.120]
For me about this posted meter painting the next thing

[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.700]
I mean, not that I'm so lazy

[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.480]
I don't want to have to

[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.140]
Slept that thing over to the post office

[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.580]
And stand online for half an hour

[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.200]
And then walk up there with a stupid letter

[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.000]
And have a look at me saying

[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.000]
What's that?

[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.840]
What are you doing here with that?

[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.520]
Here's for Lauderdale, hello?

[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:55.860]
Yes sir

[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:56.220]
How you doing?

[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:56.600]
Great

[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.260]
I was in the article today in the

[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.320]
Harold and the Broward section

[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:00.660]
Yes

[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:05.380]
It wasn't something the church of creator, hey group

[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.960]
Did you read that?

[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.440]
I mean all four members?

[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:10.980]
I don't care about that

[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.620]
What I found interesting about the article was the end

[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.380]
How they were explaining how Florida is one of the few states that

[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.860]
That severe penalties for hate crimes

[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.060]
And the first person they applied to was some Jewish lawyer, Hope Cohen

[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:30.640]
Now he's defending the guy that is going to be the hate crimes movie of the American people

[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.740]
Listen just a few months ago

[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.900]
They had that Alan, that publicity, how Alan Dushewitz on there

[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.460]
Talking about how he would defend this virulent Nazi from the West Coast

[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.360]
He was on there on the Today Shore, one of those horrible morning shows

[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.660]
But the thing with this guy

[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.660]
The thing with this herb, Cohen guy

[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.620]
He was a victim of a hate crime

[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.720]
Now he's defending one of these guys

[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.620]
Who's having a hate crime

[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.840]
Trying to get him plied on them

[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.520]
It's just...

[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:04.680]
Come on

[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.400]
Oh! That was great!

[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.560]
Thanks go answer

[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.260]
And by the way let me ask you something

[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.420]
How young is two young?

[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.820]
Okay five, six, seven, oh five, six, eight, pound five, 60 on our mobile one line

[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.280]
They're starting up with a shroud of Turincraft again

[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.060]
Oh yeah

[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.000]
Ancient pollen may link shroud to Jesus

[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.520]
Anybody finest?

[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.020]
No

[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:25.780]
Oh, yeah, they are.

[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.580]
People that are just clinging, just looking for some evidence,

[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.560]
some proof from like eight million years ago, you know?

[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.800]
And of course we do realize that the world is only 6,000 years old.

[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.960]
We do understand that, don't we?

[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.540]
That's right.

[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.540]
All that carbon dating crap, all this stuff about millions and billions of years,

[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.480]
that's just another communist plot.

[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:52.200]
Those Marxist-Heathen obnoxious bastards, like the one we're listening to right now.

[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.360]
Just another communist pinko plot to try to throw us off the, of course, the heaven,

[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.640]
off the highway to heaven, or off the stairway to heaven.

[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.880]
And if I ever hear that again.

[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.540]
So where am I going to find that bit?

[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.140]
Maybe the audience knows the name of that thing.

[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.100]
It's worth a try.

[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:09.520]
Huh?

[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:10.860]
How do I describe it?

[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.520]
It's a Frank Sinatra bit in the end.

[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:18.060]
He says, I'm checking out in Nelson Ritalin as a workist, where is Nelson?

[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.460]
Nelson, what's the name of that bit?

[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:20.960]
We don't know.

[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.440]
I look through this whole damn thing.

[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.020]
I know it's in there because I've played it.

[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.540]
Any other bit in the world I could find.

[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:31.420]
I look through every single other thing that's in here, and we've only got 72,465 bits

[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.260]
in the DCS computer over here.

[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.540]
I know every single lot of them.

[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.240]
And that one that I'm looking for, George doesn't know it.

[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.260]
I looked at him this morning.

[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.120]
I said, what's the name of that?

[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.620]
He went, like that.

[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.080]
And so I proceeded to go through for like an hour and 15 minutes.

[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.080]
I scroll through the whole goddamn thing.

[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:46.680]
Can I find it?

[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.420]
How about the bit?

[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.080]
Can I find that?

[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.280]
No.

[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:48.560]
No.

[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.240]
Yeah.

[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.300]
Desperate.

[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.460]
Here's coconut crere.

[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:53.740]
Hello.

[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:54.600]
Hello.

[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.180]
Yes, sir.

[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.140]
What did they say?

[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.700]
You said crap.

[00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:58.300]
Okay.

[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.180]
I'm just a check.

[00:15:59.220 --> 00:15:59.760]
Not on the ear though.

[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:00.740]
I got to be.

[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.660]
Just so we're being honest here, I was flipping between golf and wrestling last night.

[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:05.160]
Oh, great.

[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.540]
So I really have no life.

[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:08.020]
Right.

[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.220]
And which one was more entertaining?

[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:09.900]
A wrestling.

[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:10.720]
Oh, great.

[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.060]
Well, here's another honest guy.

[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:12.520]
That's two.

[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.000]
Also, AOL's down to 90.

[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.160]
Plunge your brains out.

[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.500]
I see that, but you know something when it was down to 98 a couple of days ago, I was thinking

[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.620]
of myself, plunge your brains out.

[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.220]
And then I saw this morning was 92.

[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.400]
And now it's not a 90.

[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.300]
And I think I'll wait.

[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:24.880]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.380]
I can't wait till I get sound of maybe 40.

[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.400]
40 sounds good.

[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:27.800]
Okay.

[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.200]
Okay.

[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:28.520]
Thanks.

[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.700]
By the way, I see enough transportation.

[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.460]
Oh, I think it's time to sell this after.

[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.280]
And it sounds good to me.

[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.720]
I'm not that anybody out there cares.

[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.340]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.200]
See, I'm one of these guys.

[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.080]
I invest in a stock and whatever I buy it, let's say I buy it at 30.

[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.280]
Then it goes immediately down to about 26, 27.

[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.420]
That goes down to like 24.

[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.200]
And then I sit peeing in my pants every day, hoping it'll get close to 30 again.

[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.820]
And then maybe even a little bit above it.

[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.500]
And what'll happen?

[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.700]
It'll get to like 31 or 2.

[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.060]
And I'll sell it and think, wow.

[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:56.540]
You know.

[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.640]
And so I'll make about just enough to cover the transaction and that's it.

[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.620]
I got out, you know.

[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.140]
That's my life with the stock market.

[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.980]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.860]
So they don't know the name of the Frank Sinatra Apparity, but they don't know that.

[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.520]
Someone said come die with me, but that's not in here.

[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.040]
It's not?

[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.160]
No, that's not it.

[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.360]
That's not it anyway.

[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:17.920]
Is it?

[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.480]
Come die with me.

[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.200]
No.

[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.400]
But nice try though.

[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.720]
Here's a mobile and Fort Lauderdale.

[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:27.960]
Hello.

[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.380]
Hey, Proto.

[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.820]
I have some info on your post.

[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.040]
Do you have a letter for inspection?

[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:34.400]
Yes.

[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.000]
Easiest pie.

[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.760]
Take a little meter and take a little letter.

[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.520]
And you go in.

[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.560]
It's Fort Lauderdale.

[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:41.680]
At least you go all the way to the right.

[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:42.780]
No waiting.

[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:43.940]
They look at it.

[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.140]
Do the little calculations.

[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.400]
Stamp out the door.

[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:47.600]
Yeah.

[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.880]
Some of the words I have, I do have to take it in.

[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:50.600]
Yeah.

[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.100]
What a pain in the ass.

[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:52.900]
It is.

[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.580]
Why do they do that?

[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:55.240]

[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:55.980]
So you're not cheating?

[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.600]
So I'm not cheating on what?

[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.720]
Tell me how I would cheat.

[00:17:59.020 --> 00:17:59.720]
And then I'll start.

[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.620]
Well, how could anybody, first of all, let me ask you this.

[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.680]
How could anybody be spending the amount of money that I'm spending on postage and be cheating?

[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.600]
If they would just check the amount you're spending, they would automatically say, okay.

[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.980]
You're exempt from the inspection because nobody's that stupid.

[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.620]
Well, they just want to make sure it's not tampered with.

[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:13.840]
Yeah.

[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.980]
Hey, they got to be the police.

[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:16.900]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.600]
Okay, well, thanks.

[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.020]
I'm going to go in there this afternoon.

[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.380]
All right.

[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:20.600]
Yeah.

[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:21.440]
Thanks for the good news.

[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.540]
Okay, give me a project.

[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.700]
I got a disconnect by a little meter.

[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.040]
I got a pawn plug dish and unplugged that.

[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.000]
And yank out the phone core, which I can do it about four seconds, but nevertheless,

[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.440]
make it sound like a big project.

[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.000]
Oh, speaking of project, great news for the hockey fans in this town.

[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:35.660]
Yes.

[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:37.140]
Yes.

[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:37.680]
Beefle.

[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.940]
Oh, by the way, have you noticed that Beefle has gone from middle age to being an old man

[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:41.160]
now?

[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.020]
Have you noticed officially?

[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.260]
I was thinking about that this weekend as I was leaving all those parts in the hotel

[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:46.620]
in Toronto.

[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.620]
I was thinking about Beefle and about the fact that different people you've known for

[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.560]
a long period of time.

[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.940]
And actually, he used to be.

[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.080]
I don't know.

[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.420]
Would you say he was a skinny guy?

[00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.420]
I mean, if you had to describe him in the past up until the last several months, I would

[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.260]
say if anything, he was like skinnier than fat, or he was never a fat.

[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.860]
He was always a little on the slimmer side.

[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.840]
Never looked too great, but nevertheless.

[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.820]
Now, he's not only gotten...

[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:14.180]
I think the fatness has only accentuated the fact that he's now officially becoming an old man.

[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.780]
Wouldn't you agree with that?

[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.240]
He's gone from the before we knew before he got like this.

[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.400]
And now the fat has accentuated the negative and made him into an officially fat man.

[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.240]
How sad it is.

[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.280]
But anyway, he came in this morning and pointed out which I'd already seen in the papers

[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:29.780]
this morning.

[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:30.880]
Much to my dismay.

[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.820]
The spokesman, the organization is acted again just to ensure that we

[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:37.860]
have a spectacular year.

[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.340]
And don't miss to play us again this year.

[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.060]
They have resigned for one year.

[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:41.680]
Are you ready?

[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.800]
Good, well.

[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:43.920]
Oh!

[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:44.900]
Oh!

[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:46.500]
Oh!

[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.060]
Oh!

[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:47.540]
Oh!

[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:48.900]
Yeah.

[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:49.480]
Oh!

[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:49.960]
Thank you.

[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.100]
How do you like that?

[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.320]
He's a project.

[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.800]
Now, however much they're paying him, which I don't think it's an either article in the

[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.880]
paper, however much they're paying him, that's like charity.

[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.360]
People are starving on street corners.

[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.380]
People are out there pan handling it in their seconds.

[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.920]
Children are starving to death.

[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.520]
And the organization is paying Chris Wells to come back for one more year.

[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:16.640]
Which may be good because that may help to seal the fate of the spokesman and his brother,

[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.500]
the two partners in crime.

[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.980]
Here's a mobile and coral springs.

[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:21.260]
Hello?

[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.180]
Neil.

[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:22.700]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.480]
Yeah, I got a couple of things for you.

[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.020]
Go right ahead.

[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.460]
Listen, is that some actual thing that's shiny, do you know, a parody?

[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.240]
Shine-head, do you know?

[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:35.260]
Yeah, is that the one where you said the tag that he had, it sounded like a shiny,

[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.460]
idol-conner.

[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.920]
Is there no stuff there?

[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.580]
Do you feel like the ad...

[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:40.460]
No, that's not it.

[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.060]
Okay.

[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.380]
No, he's singing.

[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:46.360]
I'm backing out and at the end he's saying Nelson Reddler's orchestra.

[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:47.400]
Where is Nelson?

[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.080]
Nelson, of course, Nelson's dead, you know?

[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.020]
Oh, okay.

[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:50.560]
No, no, no.

[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:52.140]
UPS.

[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:52.840]
Yes.

[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.320]
When do UPS have the package beautifully wrapped?

[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:56.660]
Right.

[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.140]
I put it on the counter.

[00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:58.900]
Can I say bitch?

[00:20:59.280 --> 00:20:59.460]
Yes.

[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:04.640]
The bitch slices the package open, shums her hand up the package, okay?

[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.940]
She shums her hand in there.

[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.200]
All my peanuts fall out.

[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.000]
And I'm saying, what is going on here?

[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.480]
She says, if you don't like it, go to the post office.

[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.620]
What does that mean?

[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.040]
She said we have to inspect all the packages now.

[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:19.440]
Yeah.

[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:20.720]
I said, hey, I got private stuff in here.

[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.860]
I want to pull my peanuts right out and inspect this.

[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.360]
That was really upsetting.

[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.080]
You know, so far, King, please.

[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:29.540]
Okay.

[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:30.140]
Right.

[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:30.780]
See ya.

[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:35.280]
Yeah, small peanuts are like Frankie Patangeli, small potatoes.

[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:41.980]
And wasn't the Lee Strasper played the Hyman Roth in that movie, Myrlandsky, and Lee Strasper

[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.800]
had a dead, by the way, had a school of acting, which you could have fooled me.

[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.700]
He must have been kind of like the Tommy Kramer of the acting industry.

[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:49.840]
Did a good job acting, sick.

[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.600]
Oh, he really was.

[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:50.980]
Huh?

[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.180]
He was terrible.

[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.920]
In fact, in Godfather 1 and 2 of all the acting performances, most of which were brilliant,

[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.520]
I would say that his was the worst.

[00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.220]
Lee Strasper.

[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.200]
I didn't ask.

[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:01.920]
The hotel here.

[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.740]
Michael, I didn't ask questions then.

[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.000]
Mo Green, only in the Banana Republic, baby, only in Miami.

[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.340]
Listen to me.

[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.160]
This is Standby's theme for Sofaking.

[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:15.660]
You understand?

[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.740]
Where everything is held to the high Sofaking standards.

[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.240]
The selection isn't just huge.

[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.400]
It's Sofaking huge.

[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.740]
Believe me, you'll never shop anywhere else.

[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.620]
And Sofaking's price is not just low.

[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.000]
They're Sofaking low.

[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.860]
You'll never find them anywhere else.

[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.560]
Listen to me.

[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.120]
When I say Sofaking as a beautiful store, I mean Sofaking beautiful.

[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.640]
When I say, Step is helpful.

[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.200]
I mean Sofaking helpful.

[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:36.980]
Listen to me.

[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.680]
Get to know the Sofaking and enjoy a selection that's Sofaking huge.

[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.700]
A step that's Sofaking courteous.

[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.660]
And price is that a Sofaking low.

[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.700]
You'll never shop anywhere else.

[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:47.880]
But don't take it for me.

[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.900]
Take it from Satisfied, Custom of Frank and Stein.

[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:53.820]
Sofaking good.

[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.540]
You're Sofaking good.

[00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.020]
You said it.

[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.840]
10.30 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.680]
So anyway, rich pactored calls in to bring to our attention,

[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.480]
which I already saw, which I do read my newspapers, both of them in the morning.

[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.800]
And luckily, they're both so bad.

[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.340]
Everyone takes about 10 minutes to read them both from cover to cover in between all the ads.

[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:17.780]
Stephanie Laudis, who writes a half-assed TV in the, I don't know, maybe even, I don't

[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:18.500]
know what this thing is.

[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.340]
This column lets you write.

[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.300]
They don't write radio.

[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.440]
They still haven't discovered that alleged fine from the FCC.

[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:22.860]
Have they?

[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.060]
No.

[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.000]
For this show in the station.

[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:24.200]
No.

[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.300]
No, and they still haven't discovered that the Spring Rating book came out and we did great.

[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:27.520]
No.

[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:27.740]
No.

[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.420]
That's because you can still in Pasadena.

[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.180]
What a horse in Vuggie Town.

[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.100]
This is, baby.

[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:37.920]
So Stephanie writes, before we even get to Juan Carlos Cotex, she writes, Power 96 is Radio's

[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:43.400]
Bow Griffin, who occasionally files entertainment stories for NBC6, is in a news segment on

[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:48.120]
Whammy Channel 69, The Times News Show, talking to couples about their love lives.

[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:49.820]
How do you like that?

[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:50.560]
Whammy.

[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:51.620]
Get it.

[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:52.060]
It's not.

[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.020]
The Bow No is segment is on Wednesday during the 7 and 10 PM newscast.

[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.100]
Of course, it won't be on too long because the newscast and the sports are all going off.

[00:23:59.120 --> 00:23:59.860]
We understand anyway.

[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.140]
And they're going to all us indicated crap on Whammy.

[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.100]
Because Maddie, Elisabeth, left behind a great legacy there if you know what we're saying.

[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.300]
Yeah, they're all going on.

[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.160]
Now, you think that might tie in with that psychic, dark network that she's in part of,

[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.220]
which really, tweeders, and that other bitch that's running on.

[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.100]
And I'm going to tell you, they must be raking in the dough to show you.

[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.940]
I want to apologize to the people who watched the golf last night.

[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:25.820]
Now, you people don't have a life, but, but I will say this, you've got a hundred times more life

[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:29.720]
than those idiots that are called up these psychic hotlines and then the one for the tarot cards.

[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:36.320]
And you know something, the saddest part of it is who watches much music, MTV, one and two, and VH1.

[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.880]
Young people watch those networks, right?

[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:39.560]
Those channels.

[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:45.400]
And every other, every commercial breakers, at least one spot, three of the Spokegriphant and the psychic dot hotline,

[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.220]
or the tarot card bitch.

[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:53.820]
And you better hang on to your seat tight with that tarot card because very personal and amazing revelations may come when she,

[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.220]
you've gotten there and says to you,

[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.060]
I'll be sure to do that.

[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.200]
And there are millions of people.

[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.980]
It's like what I used to do shows with psychics back in those horrible.

[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.200]
And I want to apologize, by the way, it's never too late to say you're sorry.

[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:11.940]
I want to apologize not to the audience, but to myself, because I could have done so much better than wasting all those shows, all those years,

[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.840]
with, remember, Ernie Sochin, my good friend, you call the other day?

[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.920]
Trying to like to get back on the year, I guess?

[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:18.780]
About the election.

[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.300]
Ernie Sochin and those bi over the show as well.

[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.600]
Oh my god.

[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.680]
How could that be of any interest to anybody else?

[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:29.140]
As soon as the person who called, I mean, yeah, the phones were jammed.

[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:33.240]
But as soon as the person who called got there a reading, so to speak, they're gone.

[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.140]
Oh yeah, I'm going to go out tomorrow and get laid.

[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.460]
All right, and that's the end of that.

[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.220]
Now they're turning over to a real show.

[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.080]
And the same with the psychic crap we used to do.

[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.160]
Oh my god.

[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.000]
Not to mention the great things.

[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.720]
God forbid.

[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.720]
How is it that there are so many stupid, stupid, gullible idiots?

[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.680]
It's like the people that read the horoscopes in the newspaper or in the magazine.

[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:54.320]
Yeah.

[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.020]
Why do you think they put them on the funny pages?

[00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:58.140]
Huh?

[00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.280]
Stop and think about that.

[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.860]
Anyway, so the worst column in the history of the human race, and that's covered a lot of territory in this town,

[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.280]
Robert Steinbach, who just can't get the message.

[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.840]
Now, isn't this the same guy?

[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.800]
Correct me if I'm wrong.

[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.860]
He's the same guy who went on Waxi and bought his way on the year for about five minutes and was going to read.

[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:22.640]
He was going to like revolutionize, talk radio in this town, and it wasn't going to be confrontational,

[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:26.760]
and it wasn't going to be off the wall, and it was going to be, he was really going to address the problems

[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.980]
and talk to living and breathing people on the phone in this town.

[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:30.240]
Right?

[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.680]
That's still on the year, by the way.

[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:32.800]
Oh.

[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.320]
I think that even what's his name lasted longer?

[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:41.640]
Warren Schwarzmarte lasted longer than Robert Steinbach on Waxi, whatever the minor league station is,

[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.700]
that we sometimes used to go, oh, and by the way.

[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.280]
By the way, are you aware I heard was it Hank talking about yesterday?

[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:55.600]
I guess Mandage mentioned it over the weekend, that we're actually going to put some dolphin games on Waxi

[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.700]
because we have prior commitments with the Marlins.

[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:01.560]
Are you ready for that?

[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.940]
The only one of the sports enterprises on this radio station that we might make some money off of,

[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:11.500]
and anybody might possibly listen to that could possibly be worthwhile, the dolphins,

[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:18.340]
and because we have that Marlin crap, we're going to have to preempt the dolphins

[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.360]
and put them over there on 790 or some other place.

[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.760]
Thank God that we have to carry the dolphins on FM2.

[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.380]
One thing I like about that 790 is the nice personal,

[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.300]
little person who's on our phone,

[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:31.980]
yeah, it's great.

[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.300]
It's unconscionable, it's unbelievable.

[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.240]
It's just like in the spring we had Panther, back when the Panthers were playing in the playoffs,

[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:46.140]
which wasn't the lately, but I can remember they had Panther playoff games on Waxi

[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.420]
while the station was running crappy Marlin games.

[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.120]
Nice going Greg.

[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.880]
See, this is what happens when your plate gets two full.

[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.340]
Even if it's good food that you're putting on your plate,

[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.460]
when it gets two full it starts filling off the edges, it makes a mess.

[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.340]
It's all over your nice pants or Ivy League suit or your dress or whatever you're wearing or your legs,

[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.220]
and it creates a mess instead of being palatable and delicious and wonderful.

[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.220]
And that's the problem with Greg Reed sports plate.

[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.100]
It's running over and most of it by the way isn't delicious,

[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:20.840]
it's so wonderful, sensational, or appetizing, or successful, making money.

[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.860]
You're going to make money before I get to Robert Steinbach's worst column in history.

[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.020]
So a screw-and comes in this morning.

[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.660]
Just go into that, and I have to get to the abits to her and her whole sales staff

[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.040]
out about being bogus with the copy and they are.

[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.140]
I mean, they're uncomfortable with what they do.

[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.860]
There's just no concern here until I get the only time there's ever response

[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:42.620]
and your witness to this is when I get on the urine screen about it,

[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:46.560]
then all of a sudden they start running up here and she shows up with that look on her pulse.

[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.960]
And she brings in a folder, oh here's some client feedback sheets.

[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.380]
So I'm looking through these client feedback sheets,

[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.720]
which all of the clients seem to be getting pretty good results,

[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.860]
except the ones that Todd Drek has got.

[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.860]
They're all renewed, but they'd like to get more response.

[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.860]
He's, I'll see, he can never say anything good.

[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.880]
It's always got to be like, well, they renewed for another three months,

[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.840]
but they'd like to get some more response.

[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:13.420]
That's Todd Drek, because let's face it, I'm a failure, he's a success.

[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.620]
Now how would you like his home phone number?

[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.500]
So anyway, the point I'm getting to is that in the middle of this folder,

[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.420]
this is better than the time green when he was given a, he was going to give, what's his name?

[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.240]
Glenn, public, he was going to give public a phone number I was doing it like one number at a time

[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.700]
until he came into the studio live.

[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.500]
Here's the list of all the sales holes from WQAM.

[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.980]
They're home phone numbers, they're cell phone numbers, they're pages, they're addresses,

[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.480]
they're shoe size, they're penis size, which I noticed by the way,

[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.860]
next to Todd Drek, there's a blank next to that one.

[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.980]
I'm sending that to the World Church of Hate.

[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:52.160]
All right, look at that one address.

[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.140]
Isn't this great?

[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.660]
Here's Adam Silverstein, first on the list.

[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.280]
And it's interesting, how is this supposed to be alphabetized by the first name I guess?

[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.040]
Nice go on through, Anne.

[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.420]
You're even number that I thought you were, sweetheart.

[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:14.420]
Yeah, she's got it alphabetized, but like the atoms are first, Brian Schultz Schultz is third.

[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:19.940]
It's by the first name she's got it alphabetized, not by the last name, which is anybody ever see a list like that?

[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:20.140]
No.

[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:20.480]
No.

[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:26.700]
So if anybody wants one of our sales holes phone numbers, and guess who else is even on here?

[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.100]
Roy!

[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.300]
So if you want to borrow that dig black instrument, the one that's not connected,

[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.480]
we'll give you a phone number or call up.

[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:34.720]
Roy!

[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.820]
And maybe he'll own it to you.

[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.020]
And the Gildo too.

[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.840]
This is great, I'm not letting go of this by the way.

[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.820]
This is an terrorism mistake, I'm not letting go, she'll have to make her own copy.

[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.920]
I'm not giving it up for a lover money.

[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.320]
So let's see, let's give the first number of Todd Greks to direct a phone number.

[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.340]
His home number, the first number is nine.

[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:52.680]
All right!

[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.000]
Yeah.

[00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.460]
That's nine, five, four by the way.

[00:30:59.340 --> 00:30:59.680]
Nine.

[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.780]
Or is Robert Grim, the Grim Reaper would say, nine.

[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.460]
In fact, anytime, anytime it comes up here and acts as for anything, we always say nine.

[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.280]
And we give them one of these little German salutes.

[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:18.980]
21 before 11 at 560 WQM, we'll get back to Robert Steinbeck, we had a lot of stuff going on here today,

[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.040]
baby, we got the Ashwara Turin, let's hear it!

[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:21.700]
Jesus!

[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.840]
Come on, let's hear it for Jesus, and for that Shroud of Turin.

[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.380]
I would be surprised if that thing's older than the fuzla.

[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.080]
You know what, when you come right down to it, older than, what's his name?

[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:33.320]
Your buddy.

[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.720]
I've got a block, Chris Bathouse.

[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.520]
I got a block on his name, you know what?

[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:42.840]
Because every time I start visualizing that push, I get like, oh, and then gets who John Penis brought in here this morning,

[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:47.220]
who made Chris Bathouse look like, he made him look like a roblo.

[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:47.600]
Oh!

[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.620]
Made him look like a man.

[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:49.980]
Oh!

[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:50.660]
A human being.

[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.760]
David Horro from Pomponopark.

[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.320]
Nice going, Penis, you idiot.

[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.660]
David Horro show from Pomponopark.

[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:04.160]
Of all the people, I'd rather see Todd Greck, I'd rather see Chris Bathouse, I'd rather see anybody.

[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.780]
Then to see David Horro show from Pomponopark.

[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.280]
And he brings him in here this morning.

[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.920]
Was there any particular reason?

[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:11.200]
No.

[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.320]
Just to be aggravating, I guess.

[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.120]
Nice going, Penis.

[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.520]
Talk about truth and packaging.

[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.120]
Taka, whoop, pissing.

[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:19.840]
What else?

[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:20.540]
What am I missing?

[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.040]
Oh, right.

[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.840]
I've got the light, ready, he's done.

[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:31.860]
That's not good, come.

[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:32.760]
Hold it down.

[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.820]
I left the police down.

[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.080]
I've also hold on this now, Tom.

[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:41.520]
Go, Tom, stay.

[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.560]
Straight up.

[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.360]
Come inside again.

[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.560]
And I just go.

[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.120]
I'm just going to go.

[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.880]
What's my gun out?

[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.660]
Who's answering, Tom?

[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.220]
I'm a good Christian.

[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.160]
Who's having a bad day away?

[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.660]
Tom is fucking the man.

[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.220]
So is the S. R.A.

[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:15.940]
Because I'm a D.

[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.980]
Straight up.

[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:18.700]
All right.

[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.780]
I'm a S. R.A.

[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:22.940]
And I just go.

[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.140]
I'm a good Christian.

[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:24.620]

[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.320]
Who's answering, Tom?

[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.120]
Who's answering, Tom?

[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.320]
Straight up.

[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.180]
How about flying me to the moon?

[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:39.560]
I think that might be it, that's not it.

[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.320]
That's not so much of things going to drag me nuts.

[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.720]
16 before 11 at 560 WQM, 20 Robert Steinbach,

[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.180]
who is just another legendary in his own mind.

[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.520]
Tax boats sign of dim future, he writes.

[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.980]
Whether Miami, and he goes on through this long,

[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.780]
horrendous, grotesque bunch of gloom and doom

[00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.320]
like the sky is falling.

[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.160]
Because the majority of people,

[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.820]
the overwhelming majority of people said

[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.360]
to that idiotic sales tax.

[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:11.140]
And he goes on and on and on about the likes of automobile dealer Norman Bremen,

[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.760]
who's antithesis toward mass transit,

[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.000]
who should be blindingly obvious.

[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.660]
And the anxious Raul Martinez and Yadi Yadi Yadi.

[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.820]
In other words, every one of us who was against it was some kind of an evil,

[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.180]
evil piece of crap with sinister motives.

[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.300]
Isn't that what you're saying, Robert?

[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.260]
You jackass.

[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.900]
And by the way, nice show on WAMI.

[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.320]
Anybody on this ever hear it?

[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:27.520]
No.

[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.640]
But here comes the best part.

[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.100]
Residents distrust the media.

[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.640]
People often complain about that, of course, this is in the Harold.

[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:38.080]
Often complained about the Harold's diabolical attempts to control local issues.

[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:42.280]
But the paper's backing of the penny tax only demonstrates how powerless it is

[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.300]
to sway public opinion.

[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.000]
Right!

[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:45.700]
That's the good news, Robert.

[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:49.140]
In fact, whatever the Harold does, it says we do the opposite.

[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:54.020]
And with major corporations, including this paper's parent,

[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:56.620]
he puts in parentheses, parenthetically,

[00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.420]
moving out and virtually none moving in,

[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.900]
private industry also failed to generate competence.

[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:07.020]
It seems we trust no one and won't believe anyone's vision of a brighter future for Miami.

[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:08.960]
Now, listen to this.

[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.400]
This is the greatest paragraph ever written by man.

[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.800]
Maybe I've been affected by my recent cross-country drive.

[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.500]
I ran into countless people who loved where they lived,

[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.240]
and virtually none who dreamed of coming to Miami.

[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:24.580]
Let me say it again.

[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.180]
During his recent cross-country drive,

[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.780]
he ran into countless people who loved where they lived,

[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.800]
and virtually none of them who were dreaming of coming to Miami.

[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.940]
Have I ever met anybody who dreams of coming to Miami?

[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:36.200]
No.

[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.640]
In fact, anytime I'm on a plane, I'm in a airport,

[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.940]
I'm like walking down the street,

[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.940]
or just anywhere where there's a stranger,

[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.180]
and they say, hey, where are you from?

[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.260]
And I say, Miami, they immediately go, oh,

[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:47.940]
and run in the opposite direction.

[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.700]
Looking over their shoulder as they run.

[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.160]
Robert, you're living in La La Land, man.

[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.480]
And, you know, the horse is not only out of the barn.

[00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:59.460]
It's about 100 miles down the road already,

[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.500]
and all of a sudden people like this asshole are saying,

[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.500]
oh my gosh, what's going to happen now?

[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.520]
It's going to get bad here.

[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.980]
I hate to break the news to you, sweetheart,

[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.480]
but things are already pretty bad.

[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:11.820]
It's already a pretty grim and gloomy place.

[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.860]
That's why major corporations don't want to come here.

[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.640]
That's why your parent corporation of the hero,

[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.640]
hauled ass off to whatever the hell that was,

[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.420]
Silicon Valley in California,

[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.880]
because they'd count, unfortunately, as a toilet.

[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.100]
And if people are responsible for being a toilet,

[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.560]
are the same politicians that are trying to sell a little good now.

[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.660]
That should explain to you why nobody's buying.

[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.980]
Robert, nice show, by the way.

[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.560]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a mobile one line.

[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.940]
Here's a mobile-informed Myers. Hello.

[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.400]
Good morning, Neil. How you doing?

[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:43.920]
Okay, sir.

[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.800]
A little off topic here, but I have to ask you some questions

[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.960]
about the Phantom Station we have over here,

[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.300]
a W-A-W-C-N,

[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.220]
our white trash host of the morning that I listened to

[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.360]
as a warm-up for a little bit before your show comes on.

[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.380]
It's claiming that the station has inched up a little bit

[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.860]
and the recent book that's out,

[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.860]
and that you've gone into the crapper.

[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:04.820]
Really?

[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.960]
Last week, I thought you were saying that your ratings

[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.040]
were not as good as you've ever had.

[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.180]
We had a great book over here.

[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.040]
How come I had a call yesterday from somebody

[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.040]
telling me just the opposite,

[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.660]
saying that the ratings were way up and that we did great?

[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.520]
It would be real good if instead of doing all this

[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.560]
in secret over there, since we have no...

[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.960]
This may come as a shock to you,

[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.760]
even though they open up a pot and carry the programming,

[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.360]
we have no communication with them whatsoever,

[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.120]
none, zero, zippity, doodah.

[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.640]
Wouldn't it be nice if they were like facts over to us

[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.520]
since they have our facts over to us what the numbers were?

[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.900]
I mean, I'm a big boy. I can handle it.

[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.820]
In addition to which I don't get paid a dime

[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.140]
for being on the air over there,

[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.240]
so whether we have a zero share or a 90 share,

[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.920]
it really is of no relevance to my existence in any way,

[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.580]
shape or form.

[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.840]
Well, here's just the thing and the point that I wanted to make,

[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.020]
it seems that most of the new advertising

[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:53.000]
that they're able to sell on this pathetic little station

[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.600]
over here that we listen to you on,

[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.660]
comes on between the 10 and 2 hour on your show.

[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.380]
I know you don't need any more money,

[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.580]
but it seems like maybe you ought to get in on some of that.

[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.540]
No, I'd be embarrassed to take money for being on that station

[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:07.400]
with a bee place.

[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.800]
But it would be very nice if they were not facts us or call us

[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.500]
or communicate with us and let us know what the numbers are

[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.120]
because I'm glad to talk about them on here.

[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:18.300]
And I thought, see, George keeps telling me that this guy that's on the morning show over there,

[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.940]
Joe or whatever his name is, that this guy's a big fan of mine,

[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:24.120]
which is what he tells us to our, to George's ear, to his face.

[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.440]
But evidently, every Santa gets to take a shot over there,

[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.080]
which makes him feel a lot better about himself as human being,

[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:30.620]
since he gets to big shot, he's on the line.

[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.540]
He's the biggest, Neil, it's a white trash audience

[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.800]
and it's the panda to the white trash over here.

[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.840]
The audience is just the lowest element of society,

[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:43.500]
which we have plenty of over here in Southwest Florida.

[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.000]
One last question, though, these books that come out,

[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.300]
did they break it down?

[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.120]
Is it just like the station goes up?

[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.800]
Is it broken into time increments?

[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.280]
Yeah, it's broken into like 6 to 10 AM, 10 to 3, 3 to 7, and 7 to midnight.

[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.740]
So it should be pretty easy to see if the numbers go up that it's likely to be...

[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.120]
That's why I'm saying, if they would let us know what the number is,

[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.100]
or I'd be glad to put them on here, even if they were crappy.

[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.500]
One thing about me, every month when the trends come out

[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.080]
and every three months when a rating book comes up,

[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.260]
for years I've been doing this for over 20 years,

[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:11.340]
I put the numbers on here.

[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.480]
I've had plenty of books that weren't all that great,

[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.480]
and if they're not that great, we still put them on here.

[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.340]
We don't see any rely about it like some people do.

[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.060]
There you go.

[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.400]
Well, keep it up.

[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:23.300]
We love you over here, and I'm sure whatever ratings that they're enduring,

[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.120]
if indeed they are increasing, are doing completely and totally to your show.

[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:30.500]
Keep in mind, this is a station that up until about two years ago,

[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:31.560]
never even showed up in the ratings.

[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:32.220]
You got it.

[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:32.820]
Have a great day.

[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.040]
Thanks for the good news.

[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.460]
Four Myers again, playing fast and loose with our lives,

[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.140]
because that's the way the Beasley Greed Company operates.

[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.080]
The left hand, don't know what the right hand is doing.

[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.220]
And since they, you know, can't put any original programming on over there,

[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:48.400]
at least not to speak up, what they do is they open up a pot,

[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.100]
they put me on the air, they put some a handgun,

[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.020]
they chop stuff off whenever they feel like it,

[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.500]
that's a great way to run a radio station.

[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.280]
That's the Beasley F and Way, because it's cheap.

[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.540]
That's what they know how to do the best.

[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.360]
560, 560, pound 560 on the mobile one line.

[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.040]
Two 300 open lines on here for you.

[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.800]
Are we going to hear from them in four Myers, do you think?

[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:07.980]
No.

[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:09.520]
Maybe the cats got their tongue.

[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:12.080]
I mean, do they actually have somebody running the board over there

[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.160]
while they show us how they must have to play the spots,

[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.380]
like a living and breathing person,

[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.700]
who's making at least 275 an hour?

[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.940]
Here's a mobile in four-letter mail.

[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:22.120]
Hello?

[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:23.760]
Hey, Neil.

[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:24.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:25.220]
How you doing, thing?

[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:25.560]
Okay.

[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:26.200]
Good.

[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.540]
Bad news for you.

[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.640]
They're going to be announcing a stadium pretty soon here for the Marlins.

[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.640]
What do you mean they're going to be announcing a stadium?

[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.520]
In other words, we're going to wake up in the morning and they're going to say,

[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.120]
if you look out the window, there it is.

[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:40.620]
Yeah, I guess John Henry's going to put some of the bill in

[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:41.900]
and he's going to get corporate sponsors,

[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.040]
and it's going to be built in downtown Fort Lauderdale.

[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:45.620]
Why is that bad news?

[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.300]
If he wants to pay for it, I couldn't care less,

[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.220]
except that it's going to jam up traffic,

[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.360]
and nobody's going to be able to get there.

[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.500]
Exactly, but I mean, it's no longer, I guess,

[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.460]
maybe a taxpayer's burden anymore,

[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:58.240]
but I guess it's bad news because you know,

[00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.700]
there's going to be more baseball on the radio.

[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:00.240]
That's all.

[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:00.800]
Yeah.

[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.100]
By the way, next Wednesday we've got a 1 o'clock game.

[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.320]
The Giants will be here next Wednesday.

[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.060]
Mark it on your calendar.

[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.040]
We get out here at about 30.

[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.040]
Hey, can I get a request?

[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:08.820]
Yes, sir?

[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.500]
Or a prison...

[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:10.940]
Bitch.

[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:11.460]
Okay.

[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:11.760]
Okay.

[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:13.100]
I have a great day.

[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:13.760]
I'll think about it.

[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.520]
It's getting ponderous.

[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.840]
567, just like sitting here looking at an almost empty board,

[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:18.800]
it's getting ponderous too.

[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.300]
I'll turn to that.

[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.820]
It's getting really frickin ponderous.

[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.780]
567, 0560, 0560 on the mobile one line.

[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.360]
Life and a vacuum.

[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.220]
That's the way it is when you work with Beasley Greed.

[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:30.080]
Life is an vacuum.

[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:30.720]
I said this yesterday.

[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:31.300]
It's true.

[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.200]
Your show is an vacuum.

[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.640]
Everything you do is an vacuum.

[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.400]
You're coming to your little room.

[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.460]
Like I leave here yesterday, and lo and behold,

[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.640]
the world is coming to an end.

[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.460]
I mean rain and thunder and lightning.

[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:40.860]
I get home.

[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.200]
My little dog is nowhere to be found.

[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.380]
He's hiding under the bed somewhere.

[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.680]
It was like the end of the universe.

[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.580]
I'm sitting in here in a totally enclosed room.

[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:49.100]
We have no idea what's going on outside.

[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.440]
We have no news department.

[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.040]
We have no obviously weather department.

[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.920]
Like last week, one day, when the turnpike was all screwed up,

[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.500]
backed up miles, southbound.

[00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.280]
And we had nothing about it here on the year.

[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.780]
Because we're like in a vacuum, like I said before.

[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.660]
I got my nice little TV up here.

[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:03.260]
Oh, look at that.

[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.240]
The hot zone, baby, on MTV.

[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:06.740]
Oh!

[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.820]
Yeah, something for everybody on there right now.

[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.220]
I got that, and we got our satellite dish.

[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.300]
All free, all thanks to our own ingenuity.

[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.840]
And they've given us basically a bunch of crappy old equipment

[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.980]
that even nisers wouldn't sell their own beers.

[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.840]
Even a radio shack would laugh at this crap.

[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.180]
And that's it.

[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.460]
Not that I'm complaining mind you,

[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.200]
although I'm going to start complaining a lot more

[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.540]
because that crap about that indifferent routine

[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.620]
that Geltie sold me on doesn't work with this outfit.

[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.040]
Doesn't work at all.

[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.700]
Because as soon as they get that signal,

[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.180]
that you become as indifferent as they are

[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:34.980]
and that they want you to be,

[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.940]
then all of a sudden they just really slack off.

[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:37.900]
Then they do nothing.

[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:41.560]
Hey, by the way, anybody want any more sales department phone numbers?

[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:41.940]
Uh-huh.

[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.020]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:45.460]
W-Q-A-M.

[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:47.080]
Okay, nice talking to you.

[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.900]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 and 0.

[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.320]
And 0.5, 60 on a mobile one line.

[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:51.920]
Here's Miami.

[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.200]
Hello.

[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:53.020]
New.

[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:53.600]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.440]
Hey, good morning, my heart.

[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.040]
Okay.

[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.420]
Hey, I was on your website yesterday

[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:58.660]
and I want to ask you a few questions.

[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.740]
Can you tell me what that book about,

[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.480]
for what the faith is about?

[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:04.180]
Is it anything?

[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:04.720]
For what the God?

[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:05.940]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.380]
Yeah, it's a God who used to be a preacher

[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.280]
and the realizes that it's all a bunch of book crap.

[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:09.900]
It's a great book.

[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:11.120]
Yeah, that's what I think.

[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.260]
Because look at it, the church

[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.040]
and though it's accommodated themselves

[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.200]
to the changing times.

[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.500]
And whenever it's been the most convenient forum,

[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.480]
they've changed their entire philosophy

[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:21.960]
than anything.

[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.200]
So, you know what I mean?

[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.240]
I used to be a Catholic, you know,

[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:28.480]
when I was a kid, but I got out of a lot of crap.

[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.300]
I got out of a lot of crap.

[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.480]
I think that I was before they had a chance

[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.420]
to alter you as a nun.

[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:34.260]
Yeah.

[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.020]
And also, I was looking at your contract.

[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.900]
I thought you had three years left.

[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.160]
What are you going to do after three years?

[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:40.660]
You're a lever.

[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.060]
You're going to renew your...

[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:42.920]
Well, I'm getting out of here, man.

[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:43.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:44.540]
I'm going over to Europe.

[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.480]
I'm going with the people

[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.580]
are a little more civilized.

[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.720]
You should go, like, don't go to a place like London

[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.200]
or one where they'll charge you.

[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.060]
They'll go to the bathroom

[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.840]
and crap like that in the department stores.

[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:55.660]
Mm-hmm.

[00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:56.740]
Hey, can I...

[00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.640]
I like crap in the department store for a free myself.

[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.400]
Can I request a song?

[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:01.900]
Yes, sir.

[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.740]
Can you play the Cher lesbian song?

[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:04.740]
The one?

[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:05.660]
The Cher.

[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.860]
Do you believe in lesbian song?

[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:07.120]
Okay.

[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:07.620]
All right.

[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.260]
Thanks a lot, man.

[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:08.800]
Have a great day.

[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.180]
What is that called, by the way,

[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.260]
the Cher lesbian thing?

[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.080]
Do you believe in...

[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:14.700]
What does that come?

[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.620]
I can't believe she's saying,

[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.500]
what does that call, George?

[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:18.880]
George is on the phone with somebody.

[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:19.480]
I have no idea.

[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.340]
With Fort Myers?

[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.760]
Oh, with Fort Myers was on the phone?

[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.300]
They only got the numbers minutes ago.

[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:26.840]
Joe Scott, the morning guy,

[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:27.840]
who is your biggest fan

[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.340]
and declares it vehemently.

[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:30.720]
I think that guy is one of their

[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.420]
chronic ojón provocateur on the Quimath.

[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:34.380]
Oh, chronic Fort Myers, oh,

[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:35.920]
we're going to get chronic callers

[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:36.900]
from the West Coast now.

[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.500]
Oh, Jesus Christ!

[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.140]
They only got the numbers minutes ago.

[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.940]
They haven't even looked at yours yet to say.

[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.360]
Well, how come they call yesterday

[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.100]
and also said that they were talking about the numbers?

[00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:46.960]
They were mistaken.

[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.140]
You'll be getting them shortly.

[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:49.620]

[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:51.640]
And so there you go.

[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:52.840]
And we don't know anymore.

[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:53.960]
The only mention that they made about you

[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:55.640]
is that let's see what kneels numbers

[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:56.620]
look like when they come in.

[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.360]
But Joe Scott, the Joe show in the morning,

[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.580]
is your biggest fan.

[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:01.780]
Okay.

[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:02.560]
That's for you, Joe.

[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:04.920]
Although I usually don't kiss on the first date.

[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.560]
What the hell is that Cher thing called?

[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:08.740]
I can't believe she's the lesbian

[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:09.700]
that this guy wants to hear.

[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.520]
What does that call?

[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:15.100]
She's a lesbian.

[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.360]
That's not what it's called.

[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:18.480]
She's a lesbian?

[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.680]
No, it's not called that.

[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:23.480]
Oh, yeah, it is.

[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:24.380]
Okay, it's coming up in a minute.

[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.560]
What we got to do, the break first,

[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:26.020]
double play.

[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.840]
Because you sounded like a living and breathing person

[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:29.560]
onto the edge of a hundred,

[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.360]
which is what we're looking for here on this radio station.

[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.640]
And there's an envelope for George.

[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:33.400]
I wonder what's in it.

[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:34.220]
Oh, my God.

[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:34.600]
Look at that.

[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.120]
It was not good enough that George,

[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:37.460]
yet the day finally got his check

[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:38.560]
for that first appearance he made

[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.700]
where two people showed up.

[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:40.500]
I'm sorry.

[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:41.400]
Where nobody showed up.

[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:44.160]
Yeah, why is he doing a paid for an appearance

[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.020]
where nobody shows up?

[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:45.960]
By the way, Mr. Haachach,

[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:46.960]
what the hell is that all about?

[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.240]
A couple people showed three people,

[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:50.060]
but I got paid.

[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:50.700]
Good.

[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:51.360]
Let's hear it.

[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.760]
George finally got paid for that appearance

[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:53.640]
six months ago.

[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.180]
And if he's smart,

[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.200]
he'll be doing a lot more appearances

[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.780]
that Fat Boy sets up if you ask me.

[00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.780]
Before he goes off to radio, I'm more.

[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.400]
And how come Fat Boy never got to send

[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.160]
more ratings numbers?

[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.700]
Probably because Maddie beat him by a mile.

[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.880]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.800]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.900]
It's all request Tuesday.

[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.040]
We're trying to make it desperately this next month

[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.000]
through the month of August.

[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:12.620]
Can we do it?

[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:13.000]
You think?

[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:13.260]
No.

[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.800]
When you're looking to put something new on your feet,

[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.600]
am I doing the right spot by the way?

[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.040]
Oh, no.

[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.260]
This is a John Penis' fault by the way.

[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.020]
He stuck a brand new copy of New Back Road Folder.

[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.300]
That's what you see right here.

[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:34.340]
Get a high head,

[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:36.820]
push the head out.

[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:40.980]
Oh, my God.

[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.340]
No matter how hard I try,

[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:13.760]
can't get for the day to gather to tell where it is.

[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:16.560]
She won't touch a penny.

[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.360]
Shatteredly, I'm grieving.

[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.900]
It's so hard and believing.

[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.340]
Call this really like a son.

[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:32.700]
Today the guy is really harmful.

[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.940]
I can't believe she's the last one.

[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:38.780]
The last one.

[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:43.480]
You must be something wrong that she's gay.

[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:47.560]
I really don't know where I went from now.

[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.180]
I can't believe she's the last one.

[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:57.860]
I really don't know where I went wrong.

[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:01.260]
Maybe she hurts anything I saw.

[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:03.180]
That's full like the Usweet Art.

[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.920]
1103 at 560 WQM.

[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:07.840]
Here's a fact from our best post-personal friend, Joey See,

[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:08.320]
over and over.

[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:10.280]
Let me deal with that collar.

[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:14.160]
He's a piece of crap is what he is.

[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.160]
How are we supposed to be here?

[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.080]
I know all the chronic colors in this market.

[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:19.720]
Believe me when I tell you.

[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:23.360]
Many of whom call this radio station frequently like that Joe Guy.

[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.240]
That sports guy with the thick voice that makes my skin crawl.

[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.040]
Oh God.

[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.260]
Because one thing about this station,

[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.580]
they're interested in screening out the calls if they have like anything controversial to say.

[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:35.200]
But they don't care if you're a chronic.

[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:36.460]
That's one of the problems.

[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:40.580]
I guarantee you we'd have been number one by 100 miles in men 2554.

[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:41.660]
And why shouldn't we be?

[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:42.480]
Do we have any competition?

[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:42.880]
No.

[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:44.840]
Other than life.

[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.420]
So anyway, getting back to this facts from Joey See over and forth.

[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.760]
So this guy calls up there all the time.

[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.080]
Is a professional trouble like with no life.

[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:56.320]
I don't want to get personal with you, sir, because I don't know you.

[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:57.220]
But we hate you.

[00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.460]
Everybody here hates you like poison.

[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:02.820]
And we wish you would die a wicked, mean spirited death.

[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.000]
Whatever a mean spirited death is.

[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.100]
Don't we?

[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:07.680]
Uh-huh.

[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.820]
And by the way, get off your stuff.

[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:10.300]
You're right.

[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:12.260]
Because the facts I got says,

[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:13.360]
thanks for helping us.

[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:15.120]
And believe me, they need some help.

[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.340]
It says the last four miles call is full of crap.

[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.980]
No communication is tough and five sixties fall.

[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:22.720]
Get off your stuff.

[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:23.520]
Get off your stuff.

[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.280]
Get off your stuff.

[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:24.960]
Yeah, it's his fault.

[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:25.320]
He's stupid.

[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:28.260]
You make up these stupid schedules over and over and over again.

[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:29.900]
Round the clock with these stupid schedules.

[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:30.620]
Get off your stuff.

[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:31.240]
Yeah, that's it.

[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.080]
That's his deal.

[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:33.940]
It's Duff's fault.

[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:35.220]
Not mine, sis Joey See.

[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:36.140]
And I would agree with you, sir.

[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.580]
The station is automated except for you.

[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.100]
And I have to guess the length of stop sets.

[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:44.220]
Your number four in men 25 to 54, number five, 18 to 49 men.

[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.200]
We're all Neal fans.

[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.840]
Me since 1980, he said, Joey See.

[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.280]
And his last guy is full of crap.

[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.240]
But get off your stuff.

[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:49.540]
Yeah.

[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:51.460]
How do you like that?

[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:57.920]
See, it's this and I believe it because I see the way these people operate with everything that goes on over here.

[00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:58.700]
They're uninvolved.

[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:03.680]
So certainly anything that goes on over there that we don't make any money from or don't understand the benefit from in any tangible way.

[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:04.880]
Are they going to be involved in that?

[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:05.080]
No.

[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:06.240]
Are they going to make any kind of an effort?

[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:06.420]
No.

[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.480]
This place where they don't even service the guy that counts?

[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:08.820]
No.

[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:09.400]
Of course not.

[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:11.240]
These are people.

[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:12.600]
We're surrounded by people.

[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:14.120]
I hate to put it in these terms.

[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.520]
Some of them are nice people.

[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:17.400]
Like, get off your stuff.

[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:18.320]
He's not a bad guy.

[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.660]
Never stole a freight train all over.

[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:21.640]
You know, little on the adult side.

[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:22.120]
But nevertheless.

[00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:24.620]
But they're sliding through life.

[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.480]
They're fumbling their way through life.

[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:27.520]
And then the book comes out.

[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.500]
And we go through the roof based on the fact that you're listening to me for example.

[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:33.600]
Or you're listening to some of the personalities on the station.

[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:35.200]
And then they go, oh yeah, we're great.

[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:35.880]
We're great.

[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:37.700]
Every place I've ever worked in this business.

[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:38.840]
It's always been the same.

[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:40.820]
Remember the boy Gary Days?

[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.140]
If we ever had a bad book.

[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:43.920]
And of course we did.

[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.800]
Over those nine or ten years I was at IOD.

[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.580]
There were times we had books that weren't all that great.

[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.880]
And he come in with the big sheets full.

[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.180]
You know, for Gimamsen, they're waiting to put the numbers on the year.

[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.180]
Like I have for a hundred years.

[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.640]
And he walked in with a fistful of paper.

[00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:58.240]
And then he'd look at me with that front.

[00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.080]
Oh, we stuck.

[00:50:59.400 --> 00:50:59.720]
We stuck.

[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:03.060]
And every time he would say that, no, you stuck.

[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:05.440]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.700]
Yeah, I think the hump on my degree with that.

[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:09.020]
That guy said it was fun.

[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:09.260]
Yeah.

[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.040]
Boy, did they hate each other or what?

[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:12.940]
Like poison.

[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:18.600]
And even though Hank is full of crap, I didn't tell us about all the money he wins at the track.

[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:22.220]
How come we never hear Hank at a Kaplan ton about all the, when he lose the rags at the track.

[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:23.220]
Only about all the cash.

[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:26.280]
But nevertheless, he was sure white on target when he come to boy Gary.

[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:26.780]
Oh!

[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:27.620]
Nice going, Humber.

[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:30.300]
God, we see a jackass.

[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:31.340]
We suck.

[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:33.900]
And then if we have a good book, oh, we're great.

[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:34.880]
We're number one.

[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:35.680]
Yeah, we.

[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:36.480]
We.

[00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.540]
Like what time is yours show on you, asshole?

[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.460]
Boy, Gary and Steve Nichol.

[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.000]
And by the way, get off your duck.

[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:43.660]
Yeah, get with it.

[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:43.960]
Okay.

[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.080]
Well, how much would it cost to make a call to Fort Myers?

[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:47.720]
Well, that's right.

[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:48.540]
More than we can afford.

[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:49.900]
Probably.

[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:53.420]
Probably more than they paid for that damn plywood desk where he's got to knit.

[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:54.100]
I'm sorry.

[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:54.960]
It's at the pace.

[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:55.880]
What do they call that stuff?

[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:57.600]
Particle board.

[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.740]
Particle, that's what I'm looking for.

[00:51:58.920 --> 00:51:59.580]
Particle board.

[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.840]
That's what his desk is made of.

[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:02.700]
Particle board.

[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:05.320]
Sitting in there like it.

[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.120]
Look at a height here.

[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:07.460]
This is the program director.

[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:08.240]
And guess what?

[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.740]
Sand, the shaman must be on vacation or something or out getting laid.

[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:15.600]
He's got an office 55 times the size of the so-called program director's office.

[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:16.760]
You know, get off your duck.

[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.240]
Maybe that's why he doesn't want to get off his duck.

[00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:21.300]
Maybe that's why he does the minimum possible to slide his way through life.

[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:25.060]
Even though he is getting paid $$$ a year, which is a hell of a lot.

[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:26.740]
For a guy that makes up his schedules.

[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:28.080]
But nevertheless, we like him.

[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:30.340]
We just wish he would do something with our Fort Myers people.

[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:33.180]
So number four meant 2554.

[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.240]
That might sound very impressive.

[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:35.660]
The only problem is in Fort Myers.

[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:36.160]
What do they got?

[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.180]
Five stations, I think?

[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:37.560]
Uh-huh.

[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.060]
So I mean, number four out of what?

[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:44.160]
So thank you, Joey, for giving me that information.

[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:45.660]
But it isn't really very elusive in.

[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:48.400]
Well, we don't know what the story is or what the number is.

[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:49.960]
Do you follow what I'm saying?

[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:53.080]
In other words, the top three stations might have like 15 shares.

[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:55.960]
We might be number four with the 0.2 or something like that.

[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.620]
So just knowing what number we are.

[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:00.700]
And may say, yeah, we're not looking to have our ads linked, okay?

[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.980]
We're not looking to be, uh, licked all over.

[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.780]
We had nothing here to last a week with a great number.

[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:05.480]
Get off your dock.

[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.700]
Over here, which are the ones that count.

[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.380]
We're just looking for a little truth and packaging.

[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:11.080]
Is there anybody listening over there except at crusty old part,

[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.980]
who we all hate like poison and wish would die before noon today?

[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.940]
I'm calling my close personal friend Mickey Daines since I'm such a believer in psychics

[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:19.720]
and going to have her put a curse on that guy.

[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.100]
We don't even know his name yet.

[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:21.920]
We'll find out.

[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.080]
We'll come and get you, pal.

[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.000]
You piece of crap.

[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.100]
You old disgusting foul.

[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.320]
Have you ever sat in a restaurant down here?

[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:32.600]
And you see the old people sitting like, you know, way in the back, thank God.

[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:35.940]
And you heard, ah, you know, the, you know what I call it?

[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:37.020]
I call it the death rattle.

[00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:41.140]
It's the South Florida death rattle when they start that hacking cup.

[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:43.360]
And you can just, you can just feel it.

[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:45.660]
The pounds and pounds of flim.

[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:50.200]
The gallons of flim just come puking up from 50, 60, 70 years ago.

[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.620]
Puking up through their system.

[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:54.580]
And you have to be treated right in the middle of a nice dinner to listen to it.

[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:56.300]
Like that.

[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.000]
The death rattle.

[00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:01.960]
And sir, I hope they rattle your cage and you get it before the day is out.

[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.320]
You jackass that called us before.

[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:04.580]
I've told you before.

[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:06.480]
Have it I told you this for 100 years.

[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.560]
The chronic colors.

[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:08.580]
They're all mentally ill.

[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:09.500]
Have it I told you that.

[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:10.340]
George.

[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:11.520]
Yes.

[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:15.560]
And it took you while, but you finally found out that I was absolutely correct.

[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:21.220]
Not to mention anybody in particular like Greg or Andy or Andy or Mitch from the video joint.

[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.520]
Chronically, chronically twisted.

[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:26.020]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:31.380]
They make Chris a bathhouse look like a normal and they made David the, what's his name horror show?

[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:35.780]
Looks like a real guy and that's the, oh yeah, and Woody.

[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:37.780]
Not Woody Graber.

[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:42.280]
We're talking Woody from Hollywood that is also known as Steve when he called the sports shows.

[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.380]
Another chronic regular call around the station, but of course the people there that work here.

[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:46.000]
They're oblivious.

[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:50.560]
They could talk to the same six people every day and as long as they get a call here and there, they don't give a crap.

[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:53.780]
Maybe that's why they're under-rechieving.

[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:55.840]
You don't want to say a little bit of under-rechieving there?

[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.500]
Couldn't be that it's boring.

[00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:01.260]
Why don't you go back to Cuba, you sick bastard.

[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:03.460]
Hi, I'm letty Graber.

[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:05.380]
Musician extraordinaire.

[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:13.340]
By now you're all familiar with my cover of the Rock Classic American Woman, where I added my own guitar style.

[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:30.340]
You like it so much I decided to cover other Rock Classic like Smoke on the Wall.

[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.520]
And there's got her to be here.

[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:48.340]

[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.080]
Musician extraordinaire.

[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.940]
Let's hear it for this audience

[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.880]
How do you like that?

[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:40.700]
Yeah

[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.580]
We've never got it

[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:50.080]
They say that I have no chance to be safe

[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.320]
And see the light now I'll be checking out

[01:00:55.320 --> 01:01:00.780]
Before the night is full

[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:06.340]
The chairman of the board

[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:11.180]
I wasn't posing very soon I'll be

[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:16.180]
He's composing Sammy and Dino

[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.320]
Soon I will be with you

[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.700]
Who's the baby?

[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.160]
One foot in that grave

[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.700]
Some one for Barbara

[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.560]
I've got one foot in the grave

[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:33.340]
A right

[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:37.720]
He pull off surprise that I am still alive

[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.280]
Didn't die in 95

[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.040]
I don't think I'll sink today

[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.720]
My life is fading far away

[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.320]
Whoa

[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.240]
Made it through the night

[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.240]
This is surprising

[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.560]
Did not think I'd see

[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.080]
That's an arising

[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.920]
Not back for a guy

[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:03.260]
Who's one foot in the grave

[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.880]
Who pulled baby

[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:06.820]
Elves is middle

[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.240]
Where is Elves?

[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:11.720]
Is he dead?

[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.920]
Barbara, where's my lucky?

[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:15.260]
I'll check it out

[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:15.500]
I'm so proud

[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.120]
This is I am so I got a chill in my

[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.740]
Rest from getting that call

[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:21.820]
That was one of the greatest moments

[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:23.460]
I've been in here here 78 years

[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.800]
That was one of the highlights of my broadcast career

[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.140]
That's for you pal, whoever you are

[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.500]
What an audience

[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:30.700]
They don't have too much to say

[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.220]
And it's the dog days of the summer

[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.720]
And I'm sitting here pumping these numbers

[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.100]
Pumping it like crazy every day

[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.100]
Begging and pleading and hoping for a response

[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:39.760]
But nevertheless when push comes the shove

[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.280]
When the crap is on the line

[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.360]
They really come through

[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:44.380]
That was incredible

[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.460]
And by the way, where is Nelson?

[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.920]
567-0560-050-050-050

[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:52.460]
Where is Nelson?

[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.340]
That was fast

[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:57.120]
Excellent, George is on top of it

[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.440]
It must be a little over

[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.940]
A little spill over from the drugs from the weekend

[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.300]
He said it's wearing off a little bit today

[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.200]
Yesterday would have been a good day for him

[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.760]
In fact yesterday he would remember the name of the bit

[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:08.620]
Not today

[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:10.460]
Because those drugs are wearing off

[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.640]
Unlike cocaine which we read in the newspaper this morning

[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.060]
In fact your mental state for like over a month

[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:16.960]
Yeah

[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.640]
Bad article about cocaine

[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.040]
I've always told you that white powder

[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.540]
It's a killer, it'll destroy your lives

[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:23.920]
Stay away from that white powder

[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.120]
Anybody who comes near you with it just take a powder

[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.440]
Like those sparsas and Amsterdam

[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.660]
Get lost baby

[01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:31.420]
Or just keep walking with your eyes straight ahead

[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:33.280]
Like you ignore them which is what I always do

[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.020]
So I suppose that I'm still on

[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:38.900]
Why can't we find some shoes with some good stuff?

[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:39.600]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:40.060]
Yeah I'm fine

[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:40.940]
Okay, so good watermelon

[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:43.480]
567-0560-050-050-1

[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.840]
This is going to play one foot in the grave thing

[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:45.920]
I think from now it'll be to the clock

[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.280]
Because I'm getting the chills

[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.480]
I'm getting the willies

[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:51.400]
The willies are in the willies

[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:53.800]
Here's a mobile in Miami

[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:56.420]
Go ahead

[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.800]
How are you doing?

[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.960]
Great hey there with me ten seconds. I'm at a I'm at a pole booth. Okay. What the

[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.720]
Your mouth function. I'm not

[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:13.980]
Games mean just let it me get in a hole in this country. I'm gonna blow my brains out. Yeah, I'm losing my mind here

[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:20.040]
Okay, I thought it became a human being last time I pulled my head out of my ass. I ran it done network really

[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:23.440]
That's fantastic. Oh no one year screaming. You know, that's good. It had an effect already

[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:34.080]
I'm going ballistic I'm behind some shmigaggy who thinks that a dollar bill is exact change. I love that word by the way

[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.340]
Shmigaggy that's one of my favorite Yiddish words in the world

[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:36.780]
Yeah

[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:45.480]
I want to thank you for turning me on that movie it's a fantastic movie and the only thing I got to say is this this whole town

[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:51.600]
Is one big powered field show the only problem is no one's gonna pull the trigger at the end right

[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:52.900]
God watches

[01:04:54.820 --> 01:05:01.900]
Okay, and happy tissue ball. What is it? No, I don't know which one of these she was she was five six seven oh five sixty

[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:05.240]
Just what I said man, we get great information, but no response

[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:08.460]
We got 600 open lines here and only three and a half hours to kill the two o'clock

[01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:11.400]
It's gonna be just like yesterday again, isn't it and tomorrow be the same way

[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:15.680]
Uh-huh, and no, I don't want to talk about the goddamn sales tax again. See that was the problem

[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:19.420]
You know, we rode that for a couple of days. They're really big about two and a half days

[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:23.780]
Got everybody whipped up into a frenzy and actually got people excited about something in this town in the middle of the summertime

[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:27.940]
And they did a magnificent job and they overwhelmed him came out and voted no didn't nice job on that

[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:30.540]
But now it's like okay, what do we do now? What do we do for an encore?

[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:35.500]
Anybody got any suggestions? No, yeah, let's talk about that Blair which stupid movie for a couple hours

[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:39.620]
Which I didn't see and guess what I'm not gonna go see if I need vertigo

[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.120]
I

[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.620]
Can just go out and drive on any highway down here for about 20 minutes that'll do it for me every time if I need to get dizzy

[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.800]
And feel like the room is spinning around like a goddamn dreidel and heat

[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:51.860]
5 6 7 0 5 6 8

[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:57.000]
Pound 5 6 the on the 18 T wireless line and like I've told it before most people including most of you

[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.720]
Unfortunately, you don't do your own thinking you let somebody else run you around by the nose

[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:04.980]
And so I'll I'll a bunch of idiots I got to do it say oh my god

[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:10.860]
This is the greatest thing. This is so unique and so different and so exciting and you rush right out there to see it without talking to like an

[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:15.000]
Export like George he would have told you that's a piece of crap and you could have saved your five or six bucks

[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:22.340]
And you could have gone and rented network for like two bucks and seeing a really good movie. That's right or Godfather parts one through a hundred

[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:28.020]
And whatever you do JP don't ever give an order like that again

[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:35.740]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. That one movie. Why? Why open or something? Yeah?

[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:41.400]
Why open the first 5000 suckers that went to see that and they realized it was a bad movie

[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:45.240]
Played that on the media for I can out one up. Yeah, listen

[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:52.720]
You've been out the chrome Avenue. I just drove by the home detention center. Yeah, they got like a big 10 out of it with people that like I guess

[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:58.020]
I was just dying they're not eating or something. Have you seen that no? I'll go out there right after the show though

[01:06:58.020 --> 01:06:58.480]
I

[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:04.000]
Is like a ten and I get to have our free lunch ever they're starving themselves. They're doing hunger strike

[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.500]
Yeah, and they got signs all up and then there's just people sitting there watching them die

[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.900]
I mean, it's like they're really staying I've ever seen great

[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:14.420]
And also they've had you been to Smith make a 50

[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:21.740]
Gambler thing out of here. You know, no, no, no, it's huge. It's about 30 stories. It's a big hotel and casino

[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:28.780]
I know and I was just wondering like what the odds on and they regulate like say Vegas would be or is it just a big ripoff?

[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:35.500]
You know that? No, I mean, I like no, you can go out there and win just like in Hollywood. It is so huge. Yeah

[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:40.680]
Well, take away a lot of you'll be amazed at this big building they put up out here. Okay, I'm coming right up

[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.760]
Okay, now I got to go to Hollywood first because that's our fine sponsor

[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:48.180]
By the way the good news is because they dropped out on TRL for one day

[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:53.080]
They got beat out for number one on TRL a couple of days ago. You know what the number one was don't you? Limpers biscuit

[01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:59.860]
Your favorite which is a real piece of crap one of the one of the worst pieces of turret I have ever heard in my life

[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.640]
But what was number one again last night?

[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:07.460]
You know

[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.600]
You know it's gonna be number one today because it's the last day after

[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:14.860]
Do we have any idea how long they let the song stay on before they move them out they return them today is the retirement day for

[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:18.000]
This

[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:24.460]
And by the way to show you the impact the back street boys have made even on the guiding light yesterday one of the world's great shows

[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:29.300]
And they brought the real Harley back just in time to deliver the baby while Alan is recovering from his 18th heart attack

[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.480]
And they get his heart beating again for the 19th time

[01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:34.720]
And they bring the original Harley back and she has a little boy

[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.560]
And so her stepdaughter walks in and says if you decided on name yet

[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.560]
No then the stepdaughter says how about howl your a j or nick

[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.320]
That's right and then Harley says no no back street boys names please

[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:49.940]
And everybody goes

[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:57.740]
So anyway be that is it me oh I was gonna play this back to the phone so we go Luigi's on the phone with Brian

[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:04.300]
Yeah, I want to know what's going on how come Chris and Randy are interviewing you instead of the first thing

[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:08.380]
I mean what's going on here? What are you trying to try to shoot a coat something here?

[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:11.060]
What's it be like you can take some questions?

[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:14.280]
What's going on Luigi you were able to call in weren't you?

[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.240]
Yeah, well then what are you worried about?

[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:21.000]
I'm worried about because it's unfair. What's going what you guys doing over there?

[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:24.340]
What do you have any questions do you have any questions for the coach Luigi?

[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:26.400]
Luigi you got any questions for the coach

[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:32.640]
Yeah, I got a question for him. I hope you don't want to ask the question and not worry about whether Jeff and Joe are asking the question

[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.400]
You got a question ask it

[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:42.600]
I'm here. He's boring. It sucks. Yeah soon. I think Chris well get signed again for one more year

[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:48.220]
We've had our close personal friend Andy couldn't have been here at least long enough to see Chris well

[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:53.060]
He's getting signed again. He would have gone and had a couple more beers. We mentioned Andy already

[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.180]
That was the good Andy is opposed to the evil Andy

[01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:01.940]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:04.480]
Speaking of it's me Andy. How are you? Oh, yeah great

[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:11.560]
How do you like that? And I will actually leave it on the air just to show you how psychic I am

[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:14.920]
And what an absolute unbelievable asshole this punk is

[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:16.780]
Are you ready for that?

[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:21.920]
I was in such a good mood after that guy called before and gave me that so not for a bit

[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:26.240]
And speaking of one foot in the grave Andy isn't that interesting that you should just happen to call

[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.980]
You hope maybe there's a coincidence there more than just a coincidence

[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:35.120]
In fact two feet in the grave sounds real good. In fact, let's get a package deal the guy from Fort Myers and Andy from Hollywood

[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.420]
Yeah, a tooper

[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:38.500]
Tooper the price of none

[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:43.400]
Have we decided on launch yet by the way? Although I almost lost my appetite just now

[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:48.780]
I'm waiting for a call back from Maydays hearing that disgusting obnoxious you bick with his voice

[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.040]
What

[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:55.000]
That guy mentioned Maydays remember Danny's brother calls. Yeah, but I can't eat that stuff again

[01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:01.360]
They have everything they have everything voters. Yeah, but I know it is a whole new spot

[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:06.520]
Have you seen this spot like steak stuff lobster? What have you seen this bottle the first spot was the kid in school and their

[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:10.240]
He's sitting there in class and the announcement comes about his diarrhea medicine is waiting at the front

[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.380]
You know all that stuff well not I have a new one

[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:18.020]
It's a kid sitting at a ballgame in the crowd and he's got his finger in his nose searching for goal and just digging and digging

[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:21.920]
And they got him up on the big diamond board on the screen up there and everybody is looking and looking

[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:27.800]
For Amazon for Arizona whatever the hell like the gene thing is nice go on baby. Oh

[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:30.640]
You're a winner WQA and Georgia's ordering lunch along

[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:37.320]
Okay nice hearing from you see every single time I would say 99 times out of 100 when that happens

[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.900]
You notice how they vanish because it's usually some asshole

[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.400]
And when I pick him up cold at all

[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:47.520]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line

[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.520]
You know people say I should write a book and I should write a Bob book

[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.260]
But not about all this stuff from the last 23 years in this market

[01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:59.120]
I should just write a book only on the the psychology of talk radio people have called radio talk shows

[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:03.840]
Because I'm one of the few people anywhere in the world who will tell you again feel was the same way

[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:09.280]
We're probably the only two will tell you that most people call talk shows are like really and especially the regulars

[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:13.000]
They're real sick really really sick the chronic regulars

[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:19.060]
Like the other day we had the guy from the Willie eyes who was on there for about two and a half second screaming somebody's name

[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.920]
That never got on the air over and over again

[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:25.680]
In search of an identity in search of a life in search of a purpose

[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:34.080]
Here's Miami hello, let's go on nail. Okay, sir. You know they got institutions for people like a hamburger there. Yeah, they do

[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.160]
God knows they need to use it

[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.480]
With rubber walls

[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:43.420]
Hey, it's almost getting a little bit boring around here. I mean a little tropical depression or tropical wave

[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:47.780]
If you don't have little Brian Norcoz bringing hurricanes all the way from Africa with his hands over here

[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:50.680]
You know, but they were having a nervous breakdown about that storm yesterday, boy

[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:55.360]
I'm lucky and it was a bad storm and like the end of the world and he was hopping up and down their last night like rumpel stiltskin

[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:00.280]
Yeah, it was pretty bad. Yes, I thought he was gonna take off into orbit. Yeah, thank you affidon though, you know

[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:05.760]
That's who they are in that commercial again about you know not whipping up everyone into a frenzy. I love done

[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.960]
Yeah, yeah, very good. He's very good

[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:11.420]
Um, oh, you know, it really that means it's boring here, man

[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:15.000]
It's terminal. I don't know how we're gonna make it through the next month to labor day. I have no idea

[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.680]
Well, we always think the fun away and all these people in you know

[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:22.020]
You know hyped up about the dolphins and scrimmage and all this I mean

[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.440]
Thousand people go to a scrimmage

[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:31.600]
It's not even next-ubition game. It's not any kind of a game. It's a scrimmage and because it's so goddamn boring here

[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:38.100]
Sixteen thousand people show up at a scrimmage that can be is error the the greatest commentary on what this town's all about

[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:45.080]
There is no way you can get me to sit in 95 degrees right and under the far 187 on the field and I'm dark

[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:49.660]
Complexed enough and god knows if I stay on the sun any longer. I'm almost gonna be transparent

[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:53.860]
There's no way you can get me to sit up there like Juan Diaz pretty soon with any more sun

[01:13:53.860 --> 01:14:00.000]
This is no talk about that. Hey also, Neil. I mean mayor mayor panellas. I'm so glad that that vote went down

[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.640]
I know that's all news, but I just had to call mayor panellas of stronts. Have a good afternoon back at you

[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:07.280]
He's a sprints

[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.980]
That mayor pinga a sprints

[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:18.420]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. We got 60 or 70 thousand lines open here waiting on you no waiting practically

[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:25.340]
Because like this last guy says this is so unbelievably boring our first call this morning

[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:28.360]
Now he was responding to a question I asked but the first call this morning

[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:31.880]
He admitted he watched the golf last night and actually enjoyed it. How do you like that?

[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:34.520]
found an entertaining oh

[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.840]
Man, can you imagine if we only had the commercial networks

[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:43.260]
We didn't have you know the small dish or at least cable with about 600 channels

[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:49.720]
Hey, I'm gonna tell you right now. I got the big dish the small dish and the cable which means I got 75,000 channels

[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:53.860]
And most of the time there still isn't anything worth watching on it. That's the best part

[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:55.380]
Oh

[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:59.260]
But go out and spend you know seven or eight or ten grand on that HD TV for what?

[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:04.780]
I don't care how clear it is or how many black people are on it or white people or Hispanics or

[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:07.900]
Crackers how about something entertaining would be good

[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.860]
That's 48 hours last night wasn't too bad

[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:15.700]
Is that what it was for the two little kids that had a shoot daddy

[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:20.600]
And made you really know that the forced derelization should be real big in the south

[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.920]
That's where we start with it in the deep south

[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:25.640]
Neils forced derelization program

[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:33.980]
We can shift my rear end until known at 560 WQM. We got Hank Goldberg in the studio

[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:35.480]
I believe it to a clock

[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:41.640]
And then we got that dolphin crab that Marlin craft starting at six with Donnie B and a pregame at six thirty and a Philly is here in my end

[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:44.140]
Anybody go to that? No any interest whatsoever. Oh

[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:48.500]
Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. I see the

[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:53.780]
Catholic Church has reinstated the shrouded turn and down. Yes, sir right on the front page of the newspaper

[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:56.400]
Ancient pollen may link shroud to Jesus. Oh

[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.760]
You know about five years ago

[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:01.900]
Oxford Cambridge University, Chicago

[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:07.760]
MIT and Caltech approved that MIT where those kids are getting killed from drinking too much in the fraternalies

[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:14.520]
Yes, and the DNA all indicated it's 600 plus a minus 10 years. That's the age of the cloth years old

[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:18.840]
Yes, but therefore I cannot be the shrouded and covered

[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:19.920]
Jesus

[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:26.260]
Yes, yeah, yeah, and so they will not accept the facts now

[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:31.540]
They have to keep reinventing this because they're looking desperately for some tangible evidence to support a ridiculous

[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:37.720]
Fairytale about this loving God who said his only son so they could be burnt on the cross and anybody who would believe in this would

[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:41.820]
You know live forever and that what kind of a grotesque SNM story is that yes

[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:48.720]
What kind of an also to as a chosen people the Jews yes, he sat there and watched them thrown in the ovens that Auschwitz

[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.220]
Bougain was a doctor right

[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:57.000]
Right what kind of a guy is I mean let that thank God he's not mine for the angels both for blinsky

[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:03.420]
Anyhow they they just refused to accept the facts. That's all this good right and they're still finding

[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:07.620]
Nor is art and you want to know why because they have to their weak people who need a crutch

[01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:09.300]
That's the problem and hit that of course

[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:13.780]
So they got to make up some fantastic stories and then be reed all the rest of us with a brain

[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:19.020]
I don't want to believe them you see what the Pope said the Pope said over the weekend that heaven and hell

[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:23.260]
Don't exist. Yeah, as entity. They're only a state of mind

[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:26.320]
He said there are Wayne Newton of somebody's imagination, which I always very clever

[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:33.060]
So this sort of shatters everything for these poor idiots. Yeah, but anyhow they don't want to accept the facts

[01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:36.420]

1450 miles east of Jakarta that was known as the spice islands during Dutch colonial rule

[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:20.260]
If they would have just listened to the Dutch they would have gotten rid of all that crap

[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:21.800]
They'd have put a bunch of

[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:27.140]
prostitutes about they had the red light district about all those churches and people would have had a good time and said oh god

[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:31.000]
That's good instead of a totally different because of these religious nonsense as

[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:35.660]

But when the gangs armed with rocks machetes lances arrows and gasoline bombs failed to scatter officers were seen firing into the crowd

[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:04.020]

[01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:07.320]
Where people keep killing each other and hating each other

[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:09.860]

Pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. This is your marijuana smoking station for the 90s and we're proud of it

[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:23.040]
In fact, you know something I don't smoke but I'm gonna start to when it's just an opposition to this guy grand repressive country of ours

I'm gonna start lighting up and you know what I am what else. I'm gonna start smoking in here

[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:33.720]
And that's right this bull crap about no smoking how come when we were down on the second floor in the same building

[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:38.780]
We used to smoke those stokies all the time. Am I right about that or am I my memory fading every day

[01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:44.580]
During that whammy thing remember those horrible awful days and that embarrassing tv piece of crap on the worst tv station in history

Remember those days. Uh-huh

[01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:50.360]
I had that big stokie in my purse and it was lit up and he was sitting in the other room there puffing away

[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:52.680]
Look like a look wibzy the owl was in there

[01:23:54.380 --> 01:24:00.000]
But all of a sudden he moved up on the turd floor and all of a sudden. Oh, it's a non-smoking environment and Greg doesn't want to

[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.780]
Yeah, stick it up your ass, Greg, okay?

[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:04.560]
Do a moniker with that cigar

We want to smoke some of good stuff in here would improve the improve the numbers on the rest of the station in measure. Oh

Oh, I'd hate to see beef. Oh man. Can you imagine beef? Oh smoking on here

[01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:20.860]

The book is better. Absolutely correct. Sure

[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:26.300]
But that's always what I what I wanted to tell you was I learned an answer from the picture

[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:29.660]
I never understood a line from the picture that I learned about the book

[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:31.980]
Maybe I'll tell you a little about it

[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:39.280]
Yeah, you remember when he said when he says that for men's uh, uh, we as the negotiators

[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.520]
Just like that playing peanut the little little little went right

[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:45.720]
I never knew where that came from and the picture they never explained the stuff

[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:50.860]
But it's about those baccaccio's display you remember the book you must have read it years ago

[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:53.680]
Oh, I read it in ages ago. Oh, you don't remember that. No

[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:57.900]
Oh, who's an negotiator's world what that was all about the baccaccia?

[01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:00.240]
Yeah, that was a lunch for God

[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:05.020]
That's the Soviet family that always got vengeance do you remember that right

[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:12.000]
Well, that's who they was. I just wanted to make that point nothing more. Okay, Adam material and that clemenza

[01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:14.140]
Clemenza we'll see him no more

[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:17.220]
I know

[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:21.640]
Okay, huh

[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:26.540]
Maybe what's the real this is the mob they didn't like the who most could have been okay God bless you sir

[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:29.340]
I'd say how to frecky pentangely could by the way

[01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:32.600]
He's sitting in the bathtub opening up his wrist

[01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:36.600]
We've lead for frecky pentangely

[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:39.220]
These small potatoes

[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:44.720]
I say let's invite the mob into town

[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:50.000]
Instead of the herald always screaming about casino gambling in the mob shoes that would come in let's let them run this town

[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:56.080]
Then you'd see transportation then you'd see shuttle you'd see like they have that mono rail in Vegas. You know what I'm talking about

[01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:01.080]
We'd have mono rails all over the goddamn place in fact everybody in town would have mono

[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.160]
Mono a mono that's what we would be doing

[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:08.840]
Arm in arm hand in hand hand on your gland because we'd be having a great time

[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:15.500]
And instead of this place being a dying town thanks to the herald and the sun sent all we've lecturing about the evils of those one our bandits

[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:23.780]
We'd have tourists 12 months a year instead of this deadly from from pace-ochen till a labor day time when this town is dead in the goddamn up prune

[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:26.420]
Just take a look around you man

[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:31.440]
If you can find one white person anywhere around you I congratulate you right now

[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:34.780]
And the only reason the sparks are still here is because most of them can't afford to get out of town

[01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:37.860]
No, that's true. That's the only reason they're still here

[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:40.920]
They don't want to be here in this hell hole in the middle of the goddamn summer

[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.640]
They might go up northwards. It's usually cool. Oh, sorry

[01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:51.100]
See that's one good thing to feel about it good about if you can't go on vacation this summertime if you're a little bit short

[01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:55.540]
I'm cash if you're starving to death feel good about it because we're gonna how would you have gone and cooled off no place

[01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:58.940]
So let's feel good about that. We're switching over here no matter where you are

[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:12.940]

Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello

[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:35.740]
Yeah, yes, sir

[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:41.740]
First of all, I want to thank you for everything you've done because I drive all day and without you

[01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:44.420]
I'd probably be killing people like everyone else

[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:45.680]
Well

[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:53.040]
Second of all the other day I was I was in the keys and I met the Swiss girl

[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:58.500]
Yeah, you know, you know how you say you don't speak the language you shouldn't actually try

[01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:03.200]
Well, we're there talking and all of sudden she starts talking about Jews

[01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:05.420]
And she's like about Jews

[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:08.200]
about Jews and she was like

[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:12.040]
I don't know why they think that we have their money and all this

[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:17.520]
I was just like I couldn't believe what she was talking about and she said that she went to New York that

[01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:24.000]
She that the Jews didn't like her there and she didn't understand why because she was very tolerant of the Jews

[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.420]
Well, isn't that white ever? Huh? That's great. Let's one step up

[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:30.220]
Now we want the guy their money back now

[01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:31.980]
Here right anyways

[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:34.560]
Blair Witch, let's shake down the Swiss

[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:35.140]
Swiss

[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:42.560]
Yeah, but Blair Witch I think you'll hate it. It's a good movie, but I think you'll hate it

[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.820]
Well, if it's a good movie, why would I hate it?

[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:51.620]
Because like I was saying you came yeah, exactly. I was sitting in the first row and I wanted to I just wanted to leave

[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:52.680]
Okay, I'll bring a bag

[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:57.260]
All right, well thanks again. Okay. Thank you. God bless you sir. There's the good news

[01:32:57.260 --> 01:33:00.340]
We're gonna shake down the Swiss and get our money back from that gold filling

[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:01.520]
Oh my stuff

[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:04.860]
Damn Swiss. Although they do make a hell of a chocolate bar

[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:10.200]
Then in a bilgeons five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line

[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:14.160]
Do you know that the Swiss are the highest consumers of chocolate in the world and that they average

[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:18.420]
How much is it 11 kilos per person per year? Do you know how much that is

[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:23.280]
That's like about 24 pounds of chocolate per year. That's two pounds a month

[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:27.980]
That's why they have to keep all of you's money because that chocolate's expensive man

[01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:31.120]
And they don't eat crappy cheap chocolate. They eat the expensive stuff

[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:37.820]

Their teeth are grinding like a peppermill

Is she a manager?

[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:19.240]
Hi

[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:25.760]
From 095 60 WQM don't forget our poll question today can't it smush macho Ricky Martin or Jordan Knight

[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:29.100]
This is 560 QAM

[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:31.300]
Third day pig f**ker in front of GD

[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:35.220]
In general you're not a sweaty person but when it gets really hot out there

[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:38.420]
You do tend to get a little drippy especially in your ass

[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:41.760]
But don't worry it's not just you it happens to everyone

[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:46.060]
So in order to restore you to that natural dry crack you've grown accustomed to

[01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:51.020]
Menon has designed an all new product called speed crack the only deodorant designed

[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:56.820]
Especially for your ass before speed crack my ass used to get so sweaty that I was afraid people might think

[01:36:56.820 --> 01:37:00.680]
I had crapped my pants and sitting down oh forget about it

[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:03.280]
That definitely felt like I had crapped my pants

[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:06.960]
Sure the quick slide action of sweaty ass aided me in my speed walking

[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:09.760]
But overall it was more of a problem than a benefit

[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:13.420]
So every morning after your shower don't forget to brush your teeth

[01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:18.460]
Calm your hair put on regular deodorant and then drop trial and use a couple swipes of speed crack

[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:22.720]
Now available in stick and gel and look for the aerosol can coming soon

[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:26.080]
Speed crack deodorant for your ass

[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:28.560]
Well that's not blood on the fish rule is it? Oh boy

[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:34.500]
1215 at 560 WQM 560 705 60 pound 560 on a mobile one line

[01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:10.960]
No, the casino's good the casinos there. I'd agree like Meyer Lansky said the greatest casinos in the world

[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:12.940]
Really and how's the sports book over there?

[01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:19.260]

[01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:36.760]
What other things? What other sites do you recommend you're gonna run a car?

[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:44.400]
Um, I don't know probably you should really drive out drive out into the mountains and see the whole city and you know

[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:47.940]
What it's all about other than just a strip man? I'm really going forward to it. I really

[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:52.000]
Want to go if I'm sometimes to come back coming back Monday

Uh-huh. What do you say he's an asshole? What he said

[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:13.280]
Can we see that? No five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line

[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:19.760]
I go back to that Robert Steinback column that we have it any calls about and probably won't because it's so silly and so idiotic just on the push of it

[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:28.200]
He ran his cross-country drive he ran across countless people who loved where they live and virtually none of them will dream to come into Miami

[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:30.160]
How do you like that Robert? How do you think?

[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.280]
Yeah, people actually enjoyed where they were living and didn't have any desire to come here

[01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:38.940]
So they can get shot or bug or both

[01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:44.940]
Good drugs though especially on South Beach. What are you what are you looking at now? Jesus right?

[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:49.080]
In most of the night. I'm so sorry that I turned you on to this damn uh show

[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:58.040]
Lower vest her on the lower left she was there. Oh, they're almost gonna fly out. Yeah. I'm not paying. I'll catch him here. Okay. I

[01:39:58.040 --> 01:39:59.120]
Hate to break the new few but

[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:03.300]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line

[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:07.000]
I'll pay attention to him for a couple of seconds. How about let's get some of the clothes off. That's what I say

[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.860]
Get a few clothes off these guys

[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:12.920]
Of course there's one thing we all want to know how young is too young right

[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:18.900]
That's our pull question. They by the way how young is too young here's a mobile in Miami. Hello

[01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:22.880]
Oh that Britney Spears man. Yeah, like I said too young

[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:28.420]
Exactly, but you're on the other way and she's getting older by the minute. Oh man. Yeah, when she's 18

[01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:30.040]
That's her careers washed up

[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:34.580]
Then we got to get the next 14-year-old online with the next guy going out to Vegas

[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:38.720]
Yeah, bring some like ocean or nose spray man. It's so dry out there

[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:41.180]
You know compared down here my nose bleeds every time I go out there

[01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:45.900]
The most important thing you got to do is take chapstick because your lips get real dry all depending at you're gonna be playing on doing

[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:48.280]
But seriously your lips get real dry and you got to take chapstick

[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:50.900]
That's my best advice. You know

[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:55.560]
You know, probably you meant that scene then you mentioned of course as you do every day the godfather. Yeah

[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:58.040]
Oh, by the way before I mentioned that you know

[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:02.680]
You're supposed to only show that I do not tune out during the commercials because some of the cops

[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:08.580]
Yeah, thank you some of the copies. Oh hilarious. Yeah, that's like a show in itself. That's right

[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:12.180]
How do you wish the sponsors felt the same way? Yeah

[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:14.340]
Oh anyway, uh

[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:18.580]
Did you know that you know there's these taxi commercials going around?

[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:21.680]
Right

[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:25.360]
Right, you know they pulled the one where she goes into the Italian restaurant

[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:29.300]
They only ran that twice and they got such crap from the

[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:31.020]
Italian-American to

[01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:34.180]
Alon what's wrong with them if they lost their sense of humor?

[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:39.420]
And to me that was the best commercial. She comes in. She's doing the old godfather. I love it

[01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:42.920]
Overstepped you know that was my favorite one. That was the best one

[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:44.740]
They pulled that after like two or three days

[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:48.900]
Got so much from the anti-deformation league, you know something like that

[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:53.000]
Well, you know, I remember when the godfather the first one came out in 72 or three whenever was in

[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.020]
I remember on the today show and hosting it then was the illiterate Joe Dodgeola who of course happened to be from

[01:41:58.020 --> 01:41:59.560]
Guinea Hill in St. Louis and

[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:02.280]
Don't the Rodgeola yeah, and they had these

[01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:07.980]
Priest on and a guy from the Italian defamation link and the church was psychotic about it and they and in the meantime

[01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:10.340]
It's still made millions of dollars and everybody in the world has seen it

[01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:12.740]
Like the priest that just wrote the book

[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:18.080]
And yeah, right I got to get a hold of that by the way, but the greatest thing is when you're sitting in Italy and a trot

[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:23.500]
Thorea and they always have some Italian music playing in the back, you know like music and then the godfather music comes on

[01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:26.580]
I just sit there. You don't know whether the screen or lap or both great

[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:31.220]
Well, there used to be a place over West Dixie where the guy would come around with the accordion

[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:35.580]
And that was like the most popular song on the on the request list of course

[01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:41.140]
Okay, beautiful lovely

[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:44.900]
Hey, uh, good day. Okay, and keep working on it. Okay. Oh, what a voice, huh

[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:46.940]
He's no way Newton. Thank God

[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:49.420]
5 6 7 0 5 6 8

[01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:52.600]
Pond have you ever noticed by the way any similarities between a lot of the entertainers?

[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:57.060]
Well, I mean Joan Rivers. He wasn't Italian Tony Bennett. He was Italian, right? Uh-huh. Frank Snatra. Uh-huh

[01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.500]
The Dean Martin uh-huh

[01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:06.040]
A lot of Italian entertainers out there in Vegas. El Martino. Uh-huh. Wayne Newton. No. Well

[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:10.980]
Oh, no, we don't want to get in that Wayne Newton thing. Look at the way he beat the NBC for like six million, okay?

[01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:12.880]
We're not going to get it as sucked into that deal

[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:16.240]
Because he sure is talented. He's your concern kind of

[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:18.220]
He sure he sure can speak any

[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:21.140]
Through his team. God

[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:27.380]
And you know the the saddest part of it is that there there are people talk about getting sucked in sucked into the hype

[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:32.280]
Well, tell you that he's an entertainer that he puts on a great show. There are people who will actually tell you that

[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:37.460]
And every time I hear somebody say that I just uh, I want to lose it. It is funny. Pathetic

[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:42.500]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60. I love guys to talk through their teeth. You know what like Wayne Newton

[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:44.660]
He always makes you sound so sincere, you know

[01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:49.060]
Don't you always feel like you want to get up tomorrow. Talk through your teeth. Sam lettuce. Yeah. He's like Sam lettuce

[01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:51.700]
That's good or like Sam uh the uh promotion man

[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:55.800]
See, I want to tell you if I knew Jordan Knight. I would deny it

[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:00.160]
Oh, I didn't know though godfather. I didn't know no Jordan night

[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:05.020]
I wouldn't be like Sam running around of course with Sam his whole life is based on being an appendage to famous people

[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:10.060]
And the worst news is that Jordan Knight's got a new single and it's already number nine on trl

[01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:18.000]
I'll tell you all your parents out there you better check your daughters your teenage daughters to see if they've got a brain larger than their thumbnail

[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.260]
Man, you better explain know what it's all about for them before they get too carried away

[01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:29.320]
Here's bis game park. Hello. Hey, Neil better show them a picture of a fruit fly and say take a look at this. Yes, sir

[01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:30.800]

[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:31.780]
The uh

[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:37.580]
You might if I give you just a little kind of a boring little story here. Go right ahead. I've got plenty of time to kill

[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:39.340]
We got an hour and 30 and it's up and I'm coming

[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:42.840]
I'll be honest with you shows actually moving along really good. Yeah, as compared to yesterday

[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:46.200]
It was a typical Monday piece of crap but today we're moving it baby

[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:48.200]
Because we're father intensive

[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:54.140]
Anyway, so um well, I've lived here in this game part for uh since I was like 10. Oh

[01:44:54.140 --> 01:45:00.720]
You know, I like the area and I really like you know, why me? I've seen what it's turned into right turn into a push

[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:03.200]
In other words, you used to like it a lot better before I came out

[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:10.780]
But I still do I still like it because you know, I find the time to go out and do the boating thing and you know and stuff that I like

[01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:12.240]
I know you're not interested in that but yeah

[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:16.000]
Anyway, it's exciting going out there and getting you know started to get my lowering

[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:17.080]
Point the most

[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.660]
Anyway, so I

[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:26.620]
Go and I try to you know, I'm looking for a place to buy in the Miami area because I have to live here

[01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:31.440]
Due to my job. Yeah, so I buy I'm buying a piece property over on Venetian Causeway

[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:37.800]
Which is you know, it's right on the wire. It's pretty nice. It's a very nice place. I got it at a real reasonable price and

[01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:46.020]
By the way, do you know where the fork and the napkin speaking of the Venetian Causeway? Let me give you a hint the fork and the napkin were invented in

[01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:49.180]
Venetia Venice Italy Venice

[01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:53.820]
Venetia but anyway go ahead. Well, no actually the British there and everything's kind of styled in the old

[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:59.240]
You know Venice no tradition there the British have it even though they've rebidled most of the bridges there the one bridge and a lot of

[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.520]
Really smelly water around you to the

[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.940]
Yeah, yeah, we can do without the Venetian water

[01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:05.080]
Or the Venice water but

[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:12.240]
Anyway, this story gets back to this see even he's falling asleep. Go ahead. I'm making my own Phil sick

[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:15.380]
Yeah

[01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:21.320]
Yeah, I love this guy these inspectors are gonna come by and approve the house for the mortgage company right now

[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:26.200]
They're that these are now, you know, I'm not real big money earning guy, you know, but I do pretty well

[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:33.680]
You know, I'm an electrical worker and so anyway, I have this first inspector comes by he's gonna try and improve the building for the mortgage broker

[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:38.120]
That I'm gonna deal with it's a very large mortgage broker company. He goes by and he says well

[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:45.440]
I can't I can't improve the place because what floors in the carpets are down. Okay. Oh, I'll rip up the carpets and you guys can send

[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:50.340]
Another inspector out, but he writes a few other things down. He writes a few things like this and that and the other thing

[01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:54.200]
The next guy comes in. This is a several days later

[01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:58.360]
He comes in right to a whole different scenario once I've ripped the floors up

[01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:03.720]
The third guy writes a completely different scenario. Yeah, and here's the

[01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:06.120]
I'm sorry. We don't want to store here

[01:47:07.100 --> 01:47:11.820]
The final step the outcome of the whole thing is the mortgage company says well, we've approved the place

[01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:16.000]
Yeah, I said well, what what what what about these uh, you know these items, you know

[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:19.620]
It's what it's all into come to please stop that deal

[01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:21.460]
What it's born down to is that

[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:26.860]
The quality of work would ship in this town is right that a very slow

[01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:29.360]
Right and now

[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:36.280]
I thought it was just I thought it was pathetic. Well, it's company itself the company itself, which is a large mortgage

[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:41.440]
They just they came back to the whole room very sorry about that. We didn't have that information in that

Here's a mobile in bokeh. Hello

Hello, yes sir. Hey, how you doing? Yo, okay. Let's get here

[01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:49.500]
I got a quick quick store here real quick for you talking about how young's two young

[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:55.540]
Yeah, I was seeing this girl for a while about three months. How young is two young?

[01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:00.500]
Right exactly. So I'll see this girl for three months right and

[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:06.520]
31 years old. I'm 22 right right? I met her at a club. So I figured she was at least 21 right?

[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:09.260]
Or just girl, you know, I mean she looks like she's 21

[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:12.280]
back to when we were going out for about three months and

[01:56:13.540 --> 01:56:16.120]
And one day I'm going through a purse, right? Yeah, she's 17

[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:22.740]
And I came across her her driver's license. Mm-hmm. I looked at it and I figured out her age. She was only 15 years old

[01:56:22.740 --> 01:56:27.600]
Right? Uh-huh. So I can find her about it. She's like, oh, it's gonna tell you one day. You know this and that and I'm like

[01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:30.360]
Well, I mean that's statutory rate, right? Isn't it? Right?

[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:33.380]
Isn't it? Yes, it is 15. Yeah

[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:37.100]
Yeah, I mean I told you not to call you back when you're 18

[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:39.320]
Yeah

[01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:46.700]
Either that maybe she can go to work for the police in day county and by the way, I'm so glad this guy mentioned that story

[01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:52.100]
Well, he didn't really do it directly but he inspired me to bring that back to mind about the 16-year-old hooker down there

[01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:59.880]
Have you noticed all the talk about the a penny sales tax and all the obfuscation all this other bull crap that nobody wanted

[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:05.340]
Has anybody noticed what I predicted many many weeks ago? It's got to be two or three months now easy

[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:08.240]
That that story has just vanished

[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:08.700]
Oh

[01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:15.940]
With those cops that were running the prostitution ring down there in Kindle and elsewhere. I think in high alia

[01:57:16.780 --> 01:57:18.220]
with underage hookers

[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:25.100]
And allegedly there were cops from air-vee police force in date county involved in that the cop cars were showing up morning noon and night

[01:57:25.100 --> 01:57:29.700]
In the meantime, what do we got? We got Al sunshine waving his ham hocks there on channel four

[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:34.700]
Screaming about air conditioning companies that he won't name on the air nice expose yesterday on channel four by the way

[01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:40.000]
I'll not you coward you spymeless big fat turd. What a piece of crap that was

[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:44.820]
Yeah, well, they originally weren't Boka now they're in a somewhere else, but did they mention it on the air?

[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:48.760]
No, huh, so what what's kind of service you're providing for the public in the meantime?

[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:55.080]
Where's the expose? Oh, I got a jalapeno finger cut in my up pepper in my throat

[01:57:58.140 --> 01:57:58.940]
Like that

[01:57:58.940 --> 01:58:01.580]
No, seriously, where the hell's the follow-up on that story

[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:07.380]
Just vanish just disappeared just like I predicted as they swept out of the carpet all the great invested

[01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:12.140]
Journalist we got in this town the investigators. Yeah, like Ike Seaman

[01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:18.420]
And all these other brilliant reporters we got in this town just kind of slipped through their fingers the follow-up on that story

[01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:20.900]

[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:44.760]
Good afternoon Neil. Yes, sir. Congratulations on your know for your sales tax down there

[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:52.140]
Yeah, just a quick little story. I live up in Port St. Lucie, St. Lucie County. Yeah, and

[02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:58.520]
You have to tell me about it the pilot it's so funny. They just want the palms greased up there that we have a problem with the

[02:02:59.380 --> 02:03:08.960]
Something of the water is into the intercoastal and killing all the fish and all that. Yeah a lot of power. And of course St. Lucie

[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:13.380]
Pesicite too. All that so the patient said well, we don't have enough money to

[02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:17.300]
To fund anything clean up the river. We you know, we don't care. Well at the fish dive

[02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:23.940]
But we do have enough money to pay our attorneys to fight because we want another bridge over to the island

[02:03:24.340 --> 02:03:29.140]
Where maybe I don't know. Yeah, but let me ask you why are you telling us this? I mean, would all do respect you know because I am desperate

[02:03:29.140 --> 02:03:31.700]
But why are you telling us this? Just basically a little information

[02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:37.520]
There's a lot of people up here to listen to you and hopefully you know, they get the message what the politicians around the world do the same thing

[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:41.140]
Uh-huh. They just want their palms greased. They get this bridge big is this bridge built

[02:03:41.140 --> 02:03:44.780]
Yeah, there's more money for them. We can now we can raise the taxes if they need bridge

[02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:48.100]
Yeah, and it's exactly like it was down there

[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:52.040]
You know, they want to they put a half cent sent whatever but no money goes right to them

[02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:56.940]
Exactly to them. Well, let me just tell you one thing Florida sucks. Yeah, okay

[02:03:56.940 --> 02:03:59.280]
I mean, yeah, that's a problem. Okay back to you sir. Okay. Thank you

[02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:00.420]
Whoo

[02:04:02.580 --> 02:04:04.920]
Always a good time in the new hour for nice little siesta

[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:10.260]
So anybody want my dolphin tickets for this season? I don't want to wipe up screw in jokas tell a lot of all

[02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:16.080]
You know, but he's not getting all eight games and the free parking pass and of course Josh ain't getting any because he doesn't need any freebies

[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:18.960]
He's already got his passes. You don't need tickets to go to a game

[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:25.600]
I got I got news for it anybody that works in sports on this radio station that isn't getting into the dolphin games

[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:30.280]
Especially for free really need to refresh your course on sucking around. I'll tell you that right now

[02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:35.920]
In addition to which if I was working on a high paid Humper Goldberg show there in the afternoon

[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:39.300]
If I was in any way associated with that and he didn't give me free tickets to the dolphin game

[02:04:39.300 --> 02:04:41.380]
I would start getting really hostile about that

[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:43.300]
Kind of crap is that

[02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:46.560]
Now poor Joe he's in there working with Igor all day

[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:49.620]
So what the hell is he gonna get besides a migraine?

[02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:53.580]

[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.560]
Hey, let me you got a feel for the guy. You know when you have leprosy

[02:04:57.560 --> 02:05:00.040]

[02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:18.800]
You know I'm saying yeah

[02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:20.440]
Okay, maybe next time

[02:05:21.340 --> 02:05:23.400]
Here's a lady mobile in the gables hello

[02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:29.980]
Hello, yes, ma'am hi. I just called to let you know that I've listened to you for years and obviously that

[02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:33.940]
His girlfriend has no clue as to what is really good right

[02:05:34.740 --> 02:05:37.300]
All right, that's it have a great day now. Thanks. Yeah

[02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:42.540]
Yeah, she's just another dumb bitch that guy's girlfriend who hasn't got a sense of humor like most of the women in this town

[02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:48.480]
That's why we have a 1.6-year-in-woman. We got 55 billion men list them out there no women none

[02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:53.420]
About 10 that's why when I came out today and I said is drew a jewel on a guiding light and a great

[02:05:53.420 --> 02:05:54.260]
I don't know what I'm talking about

[02:05:55.020 --> 02:05:59.520]
Alan Spalding his heart keeps stop beating 50 million times and last the two a's already it stopped beating

[02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:01.020]
And they stay keeps coming back to life

[02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:06.560]
And it bring on the new Harley back just in time to spring forth with that little boy

[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:10.600]
Which I'm the only and amazingly enough they had it for the first time in soap opera history

[02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:15.820]
They had a person replacing her while she was pregnant in real life by the way a person read that looks just like her

[02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:20.480]
For the first time in soap opera history. Oh, if any women call him about that no

[02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:26.320]
No, they're too busy waiting to find out what channel Oprah is gonna be on that's a cult

[02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:30.820]
It should be banned that whole opera cult of a bunch of simple than idiotic women

[02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:36.340]
If Oprah told to go over the top of the top of 50 story building and jump they'd all be doing a hand in hand

[02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:40.700]
Maybe cry to the guy they elevate it. They'd be jamming it

[02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:41.500]
Idiots

[02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:45.840]
Here's cruel springs hello. Yeah, how you doing pretty good sir

[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:51.800]
Should I just uh duck back from San Antonio, Texas last night and on the way driving through left

[02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:54.620]
Let me stop in galaxy Mississippi and see what all this

[02:06:54.620 --> 02:06:57.320]
That wasn't it was actually great meal

[02:06:57.320 --> 02:07:02.140]
You know this I mean I've been to bluxy just before all this gambling stuff started

[02:07:02.140 --> 02:07:07.320]
Now you've got a town. I went right on the water. There's a new casino there called the Bow Revage

[02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:11.380]
And uh went in it was great. I stayed in a hotel across the way

[02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:14.960]
And there's people out at night and it's safe and there's uh

[02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:19.340]
Casinos all up and down and they're all right time and this was a hellhole

[02:07:19.340 --> 02:07:24.180]
I mean it was a toilet. Yeah, and uh, I just think you should start running and Ravens more so you can get

[02:07:24.180 --> 02:07:29.180]
In Raveny more you think I'm gonna waste my energy on that. It's not gonna happen here sir. There's no point

[02:07:29.180 --> 02:07:33.240]
All we have to do wait for all these like old people to die. No, it's not the old people

[02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:37.600]
It's the young people like governor Bush and Bobby Butterworth and the herald in the Sun sentel

[02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:41.500]
It's all the middle-aged goody two issues Bible thumping hickory critical self

[02:07:42.580 --> 02:07:45.540]
Dictating assholes these are the ones who are keeping this place in the dark age

[02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:49.100]
Well don't you think if some of these young people got out and actually voted maybe that would help

[02:07:49.340 --> 02:07:52.420]
Well when and when is that election gonna take place? Oh, I don't know

[02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:57.680]
I have no idea. It's not even on the ballot. It's not ever exactly. That's my point. It's not gonna happen

[02:07:59.140 --> 02:08:01.340]
Just be ready. It's criminal

[02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:07.360]
And they're and they're guys like Robert Steinbach at the herald this morning crying and all this turning into a toilet

[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:13.540]
And wondering where the money goes going to come from we're talking billions of dollars that we're saying no to because there are a bunch of special

[02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:17.060]
Literacy people that want to keep a death grip on this town and keep us in the dark age

[02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:18.920]
That's why we have no casinos in this state

[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:24.020]
Well, a perfect example is boxing Mississippi. Yeah, but you know, let's let's let's open one in

[02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:29.420]
In anywhere even a bunch of rednext in Baloxie. I got enough brains to realize that it brings in tons of money

[02:08:29.420 --> 02:08:32.320]
And that the people that run the joint are gonna put up with any crap

[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:37.800]
Oh, Chris. I mean, thanks, bar. Good luck, sir. I'll see you in Vegas. Not in Baloxie. Not for me

[02:08:49.580 --> 02:08:54.820]

[02:08:56.160 --> 02:08:59.820]
No, seriously. How could John penis bring that man into this building?

[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:05.460]
Can you see the things that are growing on the walls in this studio since he left here this morning about quarter to ten?

[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:13.580]
No, sir. He makes Chris bathhouse look sanitary by comparison. He makes him look appetizing

[02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:18.640]
I'm serious. Oh, you didn't see this guy. You didn't see David Horos show

No number and his cell phone and his pager and his goddamn home address and all his relatives

[02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:11.680]
Because he is the antichrist. He's the trooper cabra

[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:16.520]
Talk about truth and packaging if there's anything such as walking

[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:18.700]

[02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:23.540]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hi Neil. Yes, sir. Hi great show

[02:10:23.540 --> 02:10:30.280]
I had a couple points you you had mentioned yesterday something about spring of Florida or is that for the canker?

[02:10:30.860 --> 02:10:35.060]
fungus they got a new fungus among us here that they want to turn loose to kill the marijuana plants

[02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:39.160]
And unfortunately, what they're not admitting is that it's a fungus that doesn't go away and also kills like

[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:46.160]
A certain like tomato plants and other kind of of of produce. Yeah, I was gonna say it concerned because I'm saying you know

[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:48.360]
I live here and it's a stuff like been tested

[02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:54.480]
That it's gonna harm humans or are we gonna find that that like being not on 20 years later?

[02:10:54.960 --> 02:11:00.040]
Because it's a poison toxic poison. Yeah, it's like agent pink, huh? Right also the

[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:05.200]
There is an article in the paper. I happen to just plant that and as I was running out of house

[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:08.140]
It's something like the traffic director now is

[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:10.580]
promoting an idea to

[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:12.080]
abolish

[02:11:12.780 --> 02:11:17.160]
All tolls except for or charge commuters single commuters the tap and

[02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:22.660]
People that use public transportation ride for free. Did you see anything like that? No

[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:25.280]
You may want to check the herald you know, I don't know

[02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:30.200]
You might want to super around with that a little bit and one other thing all the people in day county

[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:33.940]
You did a great job and you see what happens when you get off your bus and you go vote

[02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:37.300]
You got to vote on everything to get things to go your way

[02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:42.660]
Okay, I'm glad you're having great day. Okay now stick our heads back at us and it'll talk for the best five six seven oh five

[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:45.540]
60 pound five sixty on the mobile one line

[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:51.120]
It's not just the one to two hour. It's a phenomenon. We have no more housing of peppers

[02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:54.020]
It can speak to us least small ration for some reason

[02:11:55.860 --> 02:11:59.060]
I ordered a whole order. Yeah, Mark and

[02:11:59.700 --> 02:12:03.100]
But we got like a big bag of like winning the bad guy. I made me real sick

[02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:06.580]
They're very good, but you can huh? Maybe they're trying to save your life

[02:12:06.580 --> 02:12:10.900]
Oh, who now's asking for that. I want some more a jalapenga peppers man. They're great

[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:14.500]
Anyway ancient pollen may link shroud to Jesus

[02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:21.040]
Who scientists in St. Louis say that bits of ancient pollen found in the shroud of Turin offer evidence that the mysterious cloth

[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:26.140]
With the outlines of a human body is indeed the burrow cloth of Jesus Christ. How do you like that? Huh?

[02:12:26.540 --> 02:12:30.160]
They found the pollen visit is what it was maybe he died from allergies

[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:31.560]
Oh my god

[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:35.780]
The finding being presented today at the 16th International Botanical Congress in St. Louis

[02:12:35.780 --> 02:12:41.440]
Clashes with carbon 14 dating a decade ago that indicated the shroud dated back only the 14th century Europe

[02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:48.580]
The finding is likely to generate enormous interest among geckys who passionately believe in the cloth as a Christian relic

[02:12:48.580 --> 02:12:53.180]
But this new evidence is unlikely to convince skeptics who have long challenged the shroud's history

[02:12:53.860 --> 02:12:56.480]
So there you go more bubble mice is for the weak minded

[02:12:58.720 --> 02:12:59.960]
Here's Miami Beach. Hello

[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:03.040]

[02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:14.740]

Hello, yes, sir. How are you Neil? Okay, trying to keep this crowd awake. I hear you

[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:25.460]
My colors are from the 14th century. Yeah exactly. Jesus. I wanted to speak about it. What do you expect?

[02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:29.180]
Sure. I wanted to speak about two things. First is the

[02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:35.660]
Blair Beach project, which is a goddamn hoax. Yeah, come on. We're not getting a bunch of calls on that today all kinds of

[02:13:35.660 --> 02:13:36.680]
The papers

[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:43.800]
Yesterday everybody was freaked out about it. Yeah, but they should start writing some movies such as American history X

[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:49.200]
Learned something about film in general and then about people in general not some hoax out

[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:50.780]
Blair Beach project

[02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:55.740]
Second is the fraternity issue you had mentioned that today. I know you don't like bringing up

[02:13:56.200 --> 02:14:01.040]
Passhills, but I'm an ex-president of my fraternity and New Jersey. Okay, great

[02:14:01.580 --> 02:14:08.180]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line goes to show you when you go to a fraternity become a potty mouth

[02:14:08.180 --> 02:14:12.240]
And you can't get toward your language and you get bleeped off the air and then we move on to the next call

[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:15.900]
That's what happens when you go to one of those stupid damn dumbass fraternities, okay?

[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:21.080]
You become sophomore in juvenile and you start saying all these things

[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:28.700]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a lady in pomp it'll be

[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:37.580]
Only back call me on a real phone line. We got the hollow sound backing and let's hear it

[02:14:37.580 --> 02:14:38.380]
Oh something fell

[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:43.580]
And it's I believe Radio Shack equipment. We got in here a phone system from hell

[02:14:46.900 --> 02:14:51.280]
5 6 7 0 5 60 see things were going along much too well for two and a half hours

[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:56.000]
I should have known that sooner or later probably sooner it would start sticking up to joint

[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:04.080]
5 6 7 0 5 60 and pomp 5 60 on the AT&T line so when's lunch coming

[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:07.180]
Here's a lady mobile and curl springs hello

[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:10.000]
Hi, Neil. Yes, ma'am

[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:15.420]
This one to let you know there are a few ladies down here listening now not too many just a very very few and most of them

[02:15:15.420 --> 02:15:19.060]
I'll admit at least I commend you on having the guts to admit it now

[02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:24.620]
We also wanted thing and I also watched the guiding light all right and I've been away all week

[02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:30.740]
And what happened when Reva last week? I've been gone for all week. Oh that that Reva storyline they got they got to stop with this already

[02:15:30.740 --> 02:15:34.120]
Okay, it's so ridiculous and then he's fencing the

[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:39.180]
A prince he's fencing with a duke or whatever the hell he is they're fencing and and along comes his brother

[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:43.680]
And he changes the tip on the end of the sword and they come back from a coffee break and they're fencing

[02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:46.140]
He spears Reva in the side and she's going oh

[02:15:46.140 --> 02:15:50.680]
Hey, now he's framing his sister with it. It is so ridiculous that part of it

[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:53.660]
In the meantime Alan of course Alan's falling had a heart attack and

[02:15:53.660 --> 02:15:57.140]
And they do the whole thing and he makes a big comeback. They go for a

[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:02.020]
Angioplasty or whatever the hell they call angiogram. He's okay. He's gonna be great. He's lying there

[02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:04.480]
All of a sudden here again he goes into cardiac arrest

[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:05.440]
The real

[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:09.820]
Harley comes back. She's brings loose with a baby. She's delivering the baby

[02:16:09.820 --> 02:16:13.520]
Just while Rick has got the things on Alan's chest and he's trying to bring him back to life again

[02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:16.760]
All of a sudden oh here comes the baby. Here comes the heartbeat again

[02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:21.840]
And fill up brings in the little baby here at that. Here's the baby and Alan opens up his eyes at the end of the show

[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:25.620]
Like that. Oh, that's so cute. Isn't that corny huh? Yeah

[02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:31.180]
And in the meantime, at least we made little improvement there on Matt anyway who looks more than like 10 years old

[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:34.920]
Oh, is your new Matt? Yeah. Oh, I didn't see him. Oh, yeah

[02:16:35.380 --> 02:16:38.140]
Oh, I give him about an eight on a scale of a hand too bad

[02:16:38.140 --> 02:16:40.920]
He certainly had proved over that five-year-old kid they had on there before

[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:46.360]
Well Vanessa looked like his mother before no, no not that Matt. This is the isn't this kid's name Matt and maybe I got the wrong name

[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:49.100]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. What's his name? No, he's not Matt

[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:53.280]
That's his name. You mean Drew's brother. Drew's make-believe brother right? Yeah

[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:55.060]
Drew the Jew her make-believe brother

[02:16:55.420 --> 02:16:57.680]
Yeah, and then she gets into a big son of dance with

[02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:03.360]
With Jesse because I who religion is more important than the rabbis concerned that he's a guy and I a

[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:04.980]
DeGuy and all of that business

[02:17:04.980 --> 02:17:07.940]
She never met enough of that. She looked about as Jewish as Heinrich Himmler

[02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:14.100]
Before that she would done anything in the world to have Jesse now she has Jesse and now she will marry because she's Jewish and really exactly

[02:17:14.780 --> 02:17:18.040]
I don't know why we keep watching it. We're hooked. We can't turn it off. I know

[02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:21.240]
Like channel four news. I hate it, but I can't turn it off. I know

[02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:26.840]
Well, I want to let you know that we're here now. We always listen. Thanks. We'd like. Okay. I love you say hi to birth power

[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:28.760]
Okay, bye-bye

[02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:39.160]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Let's see 1959 40 years 40 years. I've been watching the guiding light. Let's hear it

[02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:43.200]
Pretty sad commentary isn't it? Uh-huh

[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:47.800]
Back in the days when a soap opera used to be 15 minutes all you punks out there today

[02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:52.520]
You can't even imagine a TV show being on 15 minutes. No, can't even begin to imagine that

[02:17:53.220 --> 02:17:54.100]
15 minutes

[02:17:54.100 --> 02:17:59.840]
We had the search for tomorrow at 12 30 with show. What the hell was your name? Joanne uh, Tate

[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:00.560]
That was your name

[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:06.120]
And the actress that Mary Stewart who played Joanne Tate now she's Aunt made on the guiding light anybody buying that no

[02:18:07.700 --> 02:18:12.800]
What a memory man for unimportant stuff if I could remember the important things I'd be a multi-millionaire

[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:17.860]
But crap no seriously. I have the greatest memory for meaningless crap of anybody in the world

[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:20.260]
I could turn to the aims of horses that won

[02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:25.260]
30 years ago at Hazel Park at Jackson Hartis raceway here comes the happy trip with Ray Krunk Jr.

[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:28.620]
Driving on the outside pulls away and wins by 10. That's going right

[02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:36.220]
This is the most disgusting program. I urge everyone to complain to this station

[02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:49.060]
I just tried good jumbled

[02:18:50.260 --> 02:18:52.180]

Think my

[02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:17.480]
But he needs desperately got to take a leak and he's got an empty bottle no problem, right?

[02:20:19.500 --> 02:20:24.060]
He can just whip it out and do a little score squared right in your bottle in a plastic cup whatever it is

[02:20:24.060 --> 02:20:28.940]
And any kind of container but now for women's got to take a leak in a bottle, huh?

[02:20:30.860 --> 02:20:32.100]
God what a mess

[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:35.680]
Too bad

[02:20:37.620 --> 02:20:43.080]
Here's a lady in pop it OB. Tello. I gotta give a funnel. Hello. Hello. Yes. We'll get a funnel for you

[02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:45.500]
I'm sorry. Yes, for me well for anybody

[02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:50.280]
This is my first time calling you deal. I just tell you I'm from upstate New York

[02:20:50.820 --> 02:20:54.940]
And I've been out here for six years. You're from upstate New York. Yeah, and where might that be?

[02:20:55.480 --> 02:21:00.520]
Are you familiar with Adirondack Mountain? Oh, that's not upstate New York. That's like way upstate. Yeah

[02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:05.420]
That's way up. I wanted one once went to camp when I was 16 years old in the end fourth lake in the Adirondack Mountain

[02:21:05.420 --> 02:21:08.180]
I'm late George. All right. There you go

[02:21:08.180 --> 02:21:15.240]
Anyways, my first time listening to you my boyfriend turned me on to this morning, right and I've listening to you ever since and I just

[02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:19.060]
Am amazed by you you bro Howard's turn out of the watch exactly

[02:21:19.060 --> 02:21:22.400]
You really did and I don't need 75 lesbians in here to help me do a show

[02:21:22.400 --> 02:21:28.880]
Of course he's making 75 million year, but that's okay. And well so soon you will be too. I'll squeeze by

[02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:31.620]
I just feel to the FM you know, just that's all he did too

[02:21:31.620 --> 02:21:34.360]
I was wanting to know

[02:21:34.840 --> 02:21:38.340]
When you were talking about the gambling kid's windows and everything down here

[02:21:38.840 --> 02:21:44.280]
You were talking earlier to that gentleman right and it could be maybe because we have to support the Cuban

[02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:46.660]
What does that have to do with?

[02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:48.500]
Well, we're all going to

[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:51.420]
Supporting the Cubans there you go. There you go

[02:21:51.940 --> 02:21:57.540]
You know, where are you from here and the Colombians? I beg your pardon. Are you from here? I'm from Havana

[02:21:57.540 --> 02:22:05.060]
Havana. I'm sorry. That's okay. I don't know if I have a great taste with her. Don't do that again. Hey

[02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:10.860]
5 6 7 0 5. She doesn't like you Cuban George. That's okay. She's from the Adirondack Mountains

[02:22:10.860 --> 02:22:17.260]
I'm from upstate New York real upstate New York from Rochester, which is what real upstate see people when they say upstate people who live in New York City

[02:22:17.260 --> 02:22:21.540]
They think upstate is any place north of Yonkers. That's upstate. Guess what?

[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:26.180]
Upstate New York is like anything west of Albany

[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:32.240]
Albany's connected the in Troy anything west of there. That's really upstate New York where it bends to the west there

[02:22:33.380 --> 02:22:38.860]
Rochester canna digua Geneva Buffalo, but Tavia de Pue, Syracuse, Ferdonia, Hamburg

[02:22:39.700 --> 02:22:42.620]
Connected now. I left that out. Binghamton. Now we're talking. It's a

[02:22:44.980 --> 02:22:46.540]
Right that's upstate New York

[02:22:47.260 --> 02:22:48.220]
So when am I getting paid?

[02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:51.160]
Paid for what? I did lady says that

[02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:55.720]
Are you going to start being a guy damn uptight professional Cuban again? Well, what are they talking about?

[02:22:55.720 --> 02:22:57.960]
All the travel things you said about your Cuban mother

[02:22:59.260 --> 02:23:05.200]
Has nothing to do with things. Yes, it does and has a lot to do. I'm sure as hell does we'll find some other some reason not her

[02:23:05.200 --> 02:23:10.500]
Oh, I'm sorry. Well, maybe she's not maybe she's a ringer. Maybe she's Puerto Rican. Oh

[02:23:10.500 --> 02:23:12.140]
She's white

[02:23:19.720 --> 02:23:20.200]
You're

[02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:26.080]
560 05 60 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line

[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:29.140]
George said that the Puerto Ricans aren't white as what he said

[02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:35.480]
I heard him say it real loud. He said Puerto Ricans are sparsas is what he said those were his exact words

[02:23:35.480 --> 02:23:36.660]
There might be some white ones

[02:23:37.300 --> 02:23:39.440]
Here's a lady in Pember pine. Tell her

[02:23:39.440 --> 02:23:43.100]
I'm not you another lady listening to you and also

[02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:51.160]
Guiding light great, but the reason I'm calling you a guy just came in the worship me and said that he heard you talking about Blair witch and he couldn't get to a phone

[02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:56.280]
Right that is now my sore point because I totally hated that movie good

[02:23:56.280 --> 02:23:59.920]
And the more people that you and I can tell not to get

[02:23:59.920 --> 02:24:06.060]
Save your money don't waste your money go write a decent movie, which this one isn't it? Yeah, because I don't know if you know any of the like

[02:24:06.860 --> 02:24:12.260]
Prehyped that they had going oh, yeah, but they have a complete website that gives you a whole different picture

[02:24:12.260 --> 02:24:19.540]
And there was also a special on the sci-fi channel called the curse of the Blair witch right which I got totally sucked into because my mother saw

[02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:24.980]
Something about it people magazine and then it was supposed to be the scariest movie of all time. Oh, yeah

[02:24:24.980 --> 02:24:28.320]
Oh, no really. That's what it said. I hear it's a piece of it. That's what I hear

[02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:34.140]
Yeah, and I'll tell you if that was scary. I hear you got to be some kind of a Mongolian idiot to sit through it

[02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:36.140]
Or to think it's scary

[02:24:36.140 --> 02:24:43.520]
It is not at least it's scary, but if you want to check out something yourself or anybody else. Yeah, there's a website called mr. Showbiz.com

[02:24:44.060 --> 02:24:50.000]
And it's all readers reviews about the Blair witch and they are I'd rather go see American pie

[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:53.980]
I'd rather see a bunch of hot looking the teenage guys of squeezing each other's genitals or whatever

[02:24:55.060 --> 02:24:55.980]
Yeah, right

[02:24:57.200 --> 02:24:59.660]
But all the reviews on there are so negative

[02:24:59.660 --> 02:25:05.560]
So you need to if you're interested and you want to know about it everybody out there go read it because they'll tell you how bad a movie

[02:25:05.560 --> 02:25:10.020]
It wasn't how you're just gonna get sucked into the life. God bless you sweetheart. Thanks for the warning wait me all go ahead

[02:25:10.020 --> 02:25:15.700]
I also heard that you were asking you through was Jewish. I know she's supposed to be but I mean have you ever seen anybody so

[02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:19.760]
Go ahead you're looking in your life. Well, yeah, and didn't just look a little funny with the amicons

[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:23.380]
Yeah, here's a Jewish chick with us and here's a Puerto Rican guy that's got a Yarmacon

[02:25:23.380 --> 02:25:28.860]
Here's this little Midwestern town Springfield which was somewhere in the Midwest and they got a Puerto Rican mafia family

[02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:31.860]
That's got like only three members in it

[02:25:31.860 --> 02:25:33.340]
Well, because two are dead right

[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:39.100]
Unbelievable only on guiding light one more request. Okay, because early you could play prison bitch

[02:25:39.100 --> 02:25:44.420]
Okay, before the Miami Dolphins and say hi to pop a bowler and Jeff and Greg okay, bye

I guarantee you put mandates on there from six to ten every evening and those nighttime numbers will go skyrocketing up

[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:14.980]
Is there any doubt? No

[02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:23.180]
The greatest ex-joc sportscaster in the history of the United States. I don't want to be honest like too much

That show is great for a laughter when she rips people like oh, what are you doing?

[02:27:13.620 --> 02:27:15.780]
Yeah, they show us for man hating women

[02:27:16.340 --> 02:27:21.760]

[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:29.000]
Anyway, I want to talk to you. It was a great experience that for one thing. Yeah, you wouldn't believe who had the streets blocked off there

And these people were fit to be tied. Yeah, it was it was that was the only that was the worst part is you're talking about Ricky Martin

5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[02:28:55.360 --> 02:28:58.160]
Guiding light is great the Blair Witch project sucks

[02:28:58.760 --> 02:29:04.380]
We just took a poll 7500 people. I went to see it only seven liked it and they're all demented fools. They're all going

[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:05.560]
Like that

[02:29:06.540 --> 02:29:08.680]
Because they got sucked in by the puke cam

About that pea thing you it made me think of something. I read in playboy. You know, it's illegal to sell pee

[02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:32.100]
Really? Because people are selling it so they could

[02:29:32.660 --> 02:29:39.240]
Test you know like for doing drug tests. Uh-huh. That's what there's a kind of like that. There's a company that's made so many people have a yearning for it

The company that they make packets and they'll sell it for like

[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:48.060]
You know that this obsession with law enforcement and politicians about marijuana in this country

[02:29:48.060 --> 02:29:53.240]
It's a mental illness anybody who's upset about anybody smoking weed or having in their system

[02:29:53.240 --> 02:29:55.200]
These people need to be locked away somewhere

[02:29:55.200 --> 02:30:00.320]
Absolutely hey, and I got a lot with either horror show. Yeah, I get a podcast in over the spot report

[02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:04.460]
That guy is so dense, but I want to make sure that I'm not the wrong one here

[02:30:04.460 --> 02:30:05.660]
He said that

[02:30:05.660 --> 02:30:10.400]
As ground rule double was when the bar bounced over the fence. That's an automatic double

[02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:14.860]
Is it? No, it's a ground rule bill. No, well Joe angel said and then I don't maybe he don't know baseball

[02:30:14.860 --> 02:30:17.580]
But he said a ground rule double is

[02:30:19.040 --> 02:30:23.240]
Pretends that that field like if you got the ivy if it gets locked in the ivy or something

[02:30:24.260 --> 02:30:24.900]
He's wrong

[02:30:25.960 --> 02:30:31.760]
So a ground rule double there's several definitions it can be if a fan reaches over and touches a ball if it bounces up toward the stand

[02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:34.840]
That's a ground rule double. It can be if a ball bounces up over the fence

[02:30:34.840 --> 02:30:39.240]
That's a ground rule double and it can also be what you're saying if it can cut into vine the vines that the bring me field

[02:30:39.240 --> 02:30:40.320]
That's a ground rule double

[02:30:40.320 --> 02:30:44.280]
I never heard that in my life

[02:30:44.280 --> 02:30:48.040]
I don't know that's a joint just wow he's full of crap

[02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:54.500]
I love Britney Spears put him in the laws column. Yeah, and if I ever met her in the

[02:30:55.100 --> 02:30:57.220]
Words that Jim Manders I'd like to say uh

[02:30:57.780 --> 02:31:00.080]
Well, yeah, but now I just wanted that other thing

[02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:04.980]
And now you're expecting me to be that quick. Oh, of course. How young is too young get out of here. Yeah

[02:31:05.580 --> 02:31:08.140]
Where did you get that thing with a guy goes oh man

[02:31:10.440 --> 02:31:12.160]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[02:31:12.160 --> 02:31:16.640]
5 60 and you wonder why they're going to see the Blair Witch Project

[02:31:16.640 --> 02:31:20.580]
They had golf on TV last night and you wonder when they're going to see that piece of crap

[02:31:20.580 --> 02:31:25.700]
They're bored man. They're looking desperate. They're searching. They're reaching. They're squeezing forward

[02:31:25.700 --> 02:31:30.340]
Why do you think we're sitting there watching the stupid cartoon on MTV long after the naked flesh is gone

[02:31:30.340 --> 02:31:35.800]
Where is something good on there? Where's much music maybe they got naked teenagers on there something anywhere? Huh?

[02:31:36.380 --> 02:31:39.920]
What do they got searching desperately? Oh, they got some all look at that look what they got on there

[02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:46.180]
Oh, can't hear out of here. Worst Austin powers when we need him

[02:31:47.100 --> 02:31:50.140]
Oh, Alonzo you're so big

[02:32:02.640 --> 02:32:07.800]
Well she got those ladies and she put it up with it one night and now

[02:32:08.980 --> 02:32:10.980]
Did she forgot what the sound?

[02:32:10.980 --> 02:32:12.420]
The

[02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:20.040]

[02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:21.700]
all right

[02:32:23.620 --> 02:32:23.740]
gen

[02:32:29.260 --> 02:32:30.660]
The

[02:32:23.740 --> 02:32:25.500]
I'm gonna tell her to go away

[02:32:25.500 --> 02:32:27.600]
I'm gonna tell her to go away

[02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:29.060]
Well she's not all alone

[02:32:29.060 --> 02:32:30.980]
Then you start with getting whiter

[02:32:30.980 --> 02:32:31.900]
Turned out

[02:32:31.900 --> 02:32:33.800]
She had to decide

[02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:35.820]
15 years and five years

[02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:37.000]
She was the difference of rivers

[02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:38.020]
All through now

[02:32:38.020 --> 02:32:39.920]
I'm gonna get fucked tonight

[02:32:39.920 --> 02:32:41.200]
But that she's gone in here

[02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:43.100]
Maybe but she's looking for some hope

[02:32:43.100 --> 02:32:44.240]
She's gone out

[02:32:44.240 --> 02:32:49.840]
I'm gonna tell her to go away

[02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:51.660]
I'm gonna tell her to go away

[02:32:51.660 --> 02:32:53.800]
And she will shine my mind

[02:32:53.800 --> 02:32:55.540]
Never wanted anything to go

[02:32:55.540 --> 02:32:57.460]
Okay 132-560-WQM

[02:32:57.460 --> 02:33:00.080]
I have a facts here that I find very, very suspect

[02:33:00.080 --> 02:33:01.580]
From one of our regular chronic factors

[02:33:01.580 --> 02:33:05.760]
Who says he was shocked to hear Hank's opposition to casinos coming to Florida

[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:08.760]
The Humper is against Casino gambling in Florida

[02:33:08.760 --> 02:33:11.020]
I find it very hard to believe

[02:33:11.020 --> 02:33:13.180]
He's not already here, he should be here any minute

[02:33:13.180 --> 02:33:16.400]
Hank Goldberg is against Casino gambling in Florida

[02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:17.440]
How can that be

[02:33:18.560 --> 02:33:20.040]
Maybe you're afraid he's the bookie friend

[02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:21.600]
To all God of business, to all those who broke

[02:33:21.600 --> 02:33:23.020]
How was that possible

[02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:26.020]
This ain't gonna become like Atlantic City

[02:33:26.020 --> 02:33:27.400]
It would be like a living and breeding place

[02:33:27.400 --> 02:33:29.620]
We were all those hotels right on the beach

[02:33:29.620 --> 02:33:30.720]
It's a natural man

[02:33:32.420 --> 02:33:34.060]
I say let's do it before the place

[02:33:34.060 --> 02:33:35.500]
Completely turns into a toilet all along

[02:33:35.500 --> 02:33:36.820]
Most of it's already well on its way

[02:33:38.340 --> 02:33:39.420]
If you think that's funny

[02:33:39.420 --> 02:33:40.240]
Wait till you hear this

[02:33:41.100 --> 02:33:42.160]
Like they said in network

[02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:43.520]
If you think that's funny

[02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:47.960]
Here's a letter from my good close personal friend attorney Richard Friedman

[02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:48.980]
Nice going dick

[02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:51.480]
Again my sincerest thanks for helping

[02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:54.320]
You're helping defeating the 1% metro rail sales thanks to the

[02:33:54.320 --> 02:34:00.080]
Because you liked my rendition of the national anthem at the Panthers game on January 30th 97

[02:34:00.080 --> 02:34:04.380]
I'm sending you a courtesy copy of my four love of country CD

[02:34:04.380 --> 02:34:07.220]
A 15 song American Patriotic Music album

[02:34:07.220 --> 02:34:10.000]
Which I produced and released on July 4th 1996

[02:34:10.900 --> 02:34:13.300]
You'll also note the 28 page booklet by wrote

[02:34:13.300 --> 02:34:15.960]
Which is included there in continuing lyrics mystery of each song

[02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:18.700]
The CD can be found in the Miami-Dade County Public Library

[02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:21.580]
It's just a certainly not in a record stores because nobody would buy it

[02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:24.940]
Looking forward to hearing many more years of your irreverent comments

[02:34:24.940 --> 02:34:27.800]
Your follically challenged friend Richard Friedman

[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:29.800]
Oh

[02:34:37.820 --> 02:34:39.460]
Oh

[02:34:39.460 --> 02:34:41.800]
Who say can you see

[02:34:42.380 --> 02:34:48.080]
By the dawn's early light

[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:51.800]
What so proudly we held

[02:34:52.140 --> 02:35:06.300]
At the twilight's last gleaming whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous ice

[02:35:06.300 --> 02:35:11.460]
For the right part we want to

[02:35:11.460 --> 02:35:15.720]
We're so gallantly streaming

[02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:22.060]
Okay, don't quit your day job dick that's all I can say

[02:35:22.060 --> 02:35:22.540]
In Florida

[02:35:26.060 --> 02:35:32.520]
He's giving me a look like all of a sudden he went deaf turn up the miracle your Hank you're against casino gambling in Florida

[02:35:33.180 --> 02:35:36.520]
I told you I didn't believe that did I believe that for one second no

[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:41.420]
No some Ojon provocative some far-bisoned voice and via facts which already is a little piece of the paper

[02:35:41.420 --> 02:35:48.160]
In a waste basket where it belongs some asshole from photo-flawing who's a chronic factor that guy that idiot that jackass

[02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:53.160]
Just another guy trying to stir the pot how about trying to smoke it first before you stir it pal and

[02:35:54.020 --> 02:35:55.480]
As far as dick Friedman is concerned

[02:35:55.940 --> 02:35:57.900]
Nice job man nice hairpiece too

[02:35:58.620 --> 02:36:04.000]
That's our pull question who's got the worst hairpiece Bob Eisenberg or Richard Friedman and there's a toughie for you baby

[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:09.120]
We're gonna do a pull on it four hours tomorrow and by the way if you want Bob Eisenberg's home phone number it's a

[02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:11.020]
Beats would four five seventy nine

[02:36:12.220 --> 02:36:14.180]
I'm never gonna let go of that list okay

[02:36:14.180 --> 02:36:20.300]
I'll take it at right now I got the list and it's yeah I'm gonna pay big dividends I think we're gonna start getting some real copy in here

[02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:21.620]
Where's the list?

[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:27.980]
Oh I'm speaking of important people I was just thinking about this guy yesterday was watching my stocks fall to the bottom of the bill

[02:36:28.420 --> 02:36:34.220]
It's a great Ted David from CNBC who just came back to the airways from vacation but can't get enough of me

[02:36:34.220 --> 02:36:38.900]
You see what the Nasdaq is doing here in Europe you're sounding all happy and Nasdaq's down 52 man

[02:36:38.900 --> 02:36:44.660]
I'm not even looking at it that's why I would try to maintain a positive attitude on the air which is why I don't watch your network while I'm on the air

[02:36:44.660 --> 02:36:48.420]
I wait till I get home and I get all the press hold on while I turn down my computer

[02:36:48.420 --> 02:36:54.900]
Yeah the Dow is only down 12 and a half and a Nasdaq's down 52 but you know something I basically am out of the Nasdaq so who cares

[02:36:54.900 --> 02:36:56.620]
You know not that I want to sound selfish but

[02:36:56.620 --> 02:36:59.480]
I mean some of these stocks are making me nervous here and I get it

[02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:02.260]
What's the way AOL down to about eighty something eighty eight?

[02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:04.000]
All right great break down there

[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.800]
I say another week is the time to jump head over heels into AOL

[02:37:07.980 --> 02:37:10.300]
You've given that that's the Neil Rogers bio recommendation

[02:37:10.300 --> 02:37:14.920]
Right which is a hell of a lot better even just picking it out of a hat that most of the clowns you put on here

[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:17.460]
But anyway my CNF transportation bought it at 42

[02:37:17.460 --> 02:37:22.260]
Yesterday was 44 and 1116 so I think I think it's getting close to time to sell

[02:37:22.260 --> 02:37:23.100]
Which one was this man?

[02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:25.240]
CNF transportation can you look that up?

[02:37:25.380 --> 02:37:26.440]
Let me get you a fresh quote here

[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:30.940]
CNF is currently off quarter at 44 and 716

[02:37:30.940 --> 02:37:31.360]
Sold!

[02:37:34.060 --> 02:37:36.540]
I'm going to drive home so fast you wouldn't believe it

[02:37:36.540 --> 02:37:39.720]
There it is, well I just just call to say hello because I miss you

[02:37:39.720 --> 02:37:41.040]
I sit here all day and

[02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:42.580]
Now where were you on vacation?

[02:37:43.740 --> 02:37:47.380]
Well I went up to Cape Cod for a week and then I was home

[02:37:48.060 --> 02:37:51.200]
I'm not going to make any tasteless comments about did you fly up or drive up?

[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:54.280]
I was going to say I got out of there before the air traffic got heavy

[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:55.140]
I didn't think that

[02:37:57.480 --> 02:37:59.120]
And you actually had a flight again

[02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:03.060]
Let me congratulate CNBC for being the one network at least during the daytime hours

[02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:06.160]
That didn't get carried away for three solid weeks with that John John credit

[02:38:06.160 --> 02:38:08.180]
Because they had to put the stock market stuff on it

[02:38:08.180 --> 02:38:09.100]
We do have a mandate

[02:38:09.100 --> 02:38:10.240]
Oh God

[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:13.940]
And talk about a little of overkill if you pardon that expression

[02:38:13.940 --> 02:38:16.160]
It was bad, it was bad

[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:17.540]
It was nice to be off

[02:38:17.540 --> 02:38:19.060]
So what do you think is happening?

[02:38:19.400 --> 02:38:22.460]
Every day the air was pointing down, it's pointing down right now

[02:38:22.460 --> 02:38:24.580]
Down 52 and a half on the NASDAQ

[02:38:24.580 --> 02:38:25.920]
What do you have on in the studio?

[02:38:26.140 --> 02:38:29.340]
I just turned it on since you called, I want to see all the bad news now

[02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:33.960]
52 points is major, there are yet to happen in Bauer County worrying about this

[02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:36.040]
That's close, it's about like 200 points on the down

[02:38:36.580 --> 02:38:40.220]
Well I thought I wanted to get nervous but the NASDAQ is going in the toilet

[02:38:40.940 --> 02:38:42.900]
Well, you know, why not?

[02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:46.620]
I mean these stocks have just been overpriced or overpriced

[02:38:46.620 --> 02:38:48.080]
They don't have any of them no earnings

[02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:50.220]
But none of this makes any sense

[02:38:50.940 --> 02:38:51.740]
What doesn't?

[02:38:51.740 --> 02:38:53.880]
That's the point that it's selling off of that they were over the beginning

[02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:55.080]
That we're having this whole sell out

[02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:56.900]
Well that didn't make any sense and either does this

[02:38:56.900 --> 02:38:59.700]
Because Alan Greenspan had like two sentences in his speech

[02:38:59.700 --> 02:39:00.660]
That they didn't like

[02:39:00.660 --> 02:39:03.960]
And then because one of the stats there came out

[02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:07.120]
And would they later modify it and said that it wasn't all that bad anyway

[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:11.380]
Right away everybody, it looks to me like this market is looking for an excuse to sell

[02:39:11.380 --> 02:39:13.420]
That was the employment cost index you were for

[02:39:13.420 --> 02:39:14.160]
Right, that's right

[02:39:14.740 --> 02:39:17.640]
But the point is and I ask this of every guess I have

[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:21.340]
So if Greenspan pulls the trigger for another quarter point, so what?

[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:23.660]
And nobody seems to have an answer

[02:39:24.260 --> 02:39:26.740]
They're looking for reading the stock because it's all blown up way out of the list

[02:39:26.740 --> 02:39:29.060]
Well that's the point I think the reason is these stocks are way overvalued

[02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:31.340]
Whoever bought companies that don't have earnings

[02:39:31.340 --> 02:39:32.380]
Right, like AOL

[02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:35.020]
Well I am actually AOL has some earnings

[02:39:35.020 --> 02:39:36.680]
Amazon, how about Amazon.com?

[02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:38.740]
No, they don't have earnings

[02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:40.420]
Yeah, actually they do

[02:39:40.420 --> 02:39:44.360]
Yeah, I mean Amazon is about three in change right now 90 and 15 and 16

[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:48.160]
Yeah, they have but I mean some of these companies have no earnings and when you get to see EOL on here

[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:50.180]
And you try and nail Rogers them

[02:39:50.180 --> 02:39:51.280]
Catch my drift

[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:53.900]
Right, you know they buck you and you find the empathy

[02:39:53.900 --> 02:39:57.180]
Sure an awful lot of people have poured an awful lot of money into this stock today

[02:39:57.180 --> 02:39:58.060]
I want an answer

[02:39:58.680 --> 02:40:00.540]
And they say we don't think we can sell the EOL

[02:40:00.540 --> 02:40:01.820]
They are stock yesterday so what do we do?

[02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:05.940]
Yeah well no, then they basically say yeah we won't have any earnings on paper for three years out

[02:40:05.940 --> 02:40:06.260]
Right

[02:40:06.260 --> 02:40:07.520]
But they don't want you to know that

[02:40:07.520 --> 02:40:09.180]
It's called a wing of prayer and a hope

[02:40:09.180 --> 02:40:11.940]
Well anyway, so that's why it is what it is

[02:40:11.940 --> 02:40:14.920]
And I just wanted to say hello and can't wait to get down here in December

[02:40:14.920 --> 02:40:18.280]
Now I noticed I'm not going to this is the last time I'm going to mention Joe Kernan you

[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:23.120]
Because I noticed that the last no seriously the last two times you call I mentioned about the hours he works

[02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:27.980]
Now Joe is there when they come on at seven in the morning when Mark Haynes comes on or seven in the morning

[02:40:27.980 --> 02:40:28.160]
Right

[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:33.540]
And Joe is already there all dressed up all like showered and clean like he's been there since five at an AM

[02:40:33.540 --> 02:40:36.360]
And then when you guys go off in the evening like seven o'clock or so

[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:37.640]
He's throwing that off first of all

[02:40:37.640 --> 02:40:40.540]
First of all let me tell you in case your listeners are not aware

[02:40:40.540 --> 02:40:45.620]
The happy news if you know what your current is is that he and his wife are expecting so obviously he's been there

[02:40:45.620 --> 02:40:47.600]
He must have had just a little time in there right

[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:48.740]
He went home once at least

[02:40:48.740 --> 02:40:49.080]
Right

[02:40:49.080 --> 02:40:50.560]
Or somebody did

[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:51.900]
He's done it four o'clock

[02:40:51.900 --> 02:40:52.300]
Uh

[02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:54.280]
He's done it four o'clock

[02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:54.520]
Yeah

[02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:59.900]
Now it's for me, I was in today I did 10 to 12 and I'm going to have to do four or five and I have to do six thirty

[02:40:59.900 --> 02:41:01.000]
Oh poor baby

[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:01.880]
Well you know

[02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:06.340]
And then Mark Haynes what's he on there for about an hour and a half he's got even better hours than I've got he's got bankers hours

[02:41:06.340 --> 02:41:07.580]
No he's on for three hours

[02:41:07.580 --> 02:41:08.060]
Uh-huh

[02:41:08.060 --> 02:41:11.920]
And now you know they're starting to use drops on that show they got their own drops

[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:12.300]
Yeah

[02:41:12.300 --> 02:41:17.380]
I noticed yesterday when they showed the AOL was down to 90 it went like that it was like that

[02:41:17.380 --> 02:41:17.520]
Yeah

[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:18.820]
Little emphasis

[02:41:18.820 --> 02:41:21.960]
The bill is in the mail by the way

[02:41:22.780 --> 02:41:23.860]

[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:31.340]
Okay Ted David from CNBC who at least laughing about it the market's taking another big crap and he's laughing about it

[02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:35.320]

[02:41:35.320 --> 02:41:37.420]
He always denies it but they're I'm raking it in

[02:41:37.420 --> 02:41:39.700]
Nobody repulses you more

[02:41:39.700 --> 02:41:45.320]
And now Dr. Jeremy Burnham with a dramatic reading of no scrubs by TLC

[02:41:46.260 --> 02:41:47.300]
