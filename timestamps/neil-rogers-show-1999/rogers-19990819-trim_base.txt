[00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:09.220]
Sport Radio 560 WQAM Miami 4 Lauderdale presents the Neil Rogers Show to talk to Neil

[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.060]
called 567-0560 toll free for date and prayer.

[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.560]
Or pound 560 on your cell phone.

[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.320]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show do not necessarily

[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.200]
reflect those of WQAM easily read acquisitions or the easily broadcast group.

[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.400]
Now, Neil Rogers on Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.020]
OK, I was in the car about a half an hour ago listening to you.

[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.720]
First of all, Nick Carter has more talent than his right code than you will ever have.

[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.880]
And he's not a pineapple head, he's still a big fat baguette.

[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.080]
I had a chip name pay.

[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.200]
One day she flew away to T.O. on a where the moon is blue.

[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.280]
But with our right wing censorship, there are words that mustn't slip.

[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.800]
Do we tell you how I feel for K.A.

[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.660]
So, if you see K.A.

[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.840]
If you wanna, they'll see you in T.O. on a tune.

[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.720]
Now if you see K.A.

[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.480]
Tell her I'm a service day.

[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.400]
And the FCC won't let me sing this.

[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.160]
So I'm not supposed to say how if you see K.A.

[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.560]
Take her hand gently say, that after this transmission, I'll be out in 90 days old.

[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.020]
If you see K.A.

[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.120]
And you wanna, then I'll see you in T.O.

[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.000]
On a go, on a go, on a go, on a go, on a go.

[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.580]
I'm gonna make it cool.

[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.960]
So anyway, that bitch that called yesterday, she's a star now.

[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.640]
Okay, I was in the car about a half an hour ago listening to you.

[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.320]
First of all, Nick Carter has more challenge in his right toe than you ever had.

[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.420]
And he's not a pineapple head, he's still a big fat baguette.

[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.020]
Yeah, so what's your point, honey?

[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.440]
Oh, yesterday on the show we had two calls that, and that was one of them,

[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]
that were just so astonishing and so amazing, everything that's wrong with the human race,

[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.420]
and everything that's wrong with talk radio.

[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.700]
First of all, her, which he doesn't have any idea what she's talking about.

[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.480]
I talked to Nick on the phone last night, by the way, and he said, you were an ugly slut, is what he said.

[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.140]
And he wouldn't touch you, he wouldn't touch you with Kevin's hand.

[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.220]
But at any rate, boy.

[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.840]
And the best part of it is that she was in tears and hysterical when she first called it, which George said.

[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.140]
She was like losing it.

[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.660]
And then the second call, which I think preceded, that that was right toward the end of the show yesterday, the psychotic bitch.

[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.520]
And you got, by the way, Nick said, you got no change.

[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.100]
And in any case, it's the same diddle.

[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.860]
But the other call that came earlier in the show, and it's again a classic example of what goes on.

[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.960]
And then of course, a lot of people will pretend to be talk show people, will let this stuff go on the year and they'll pursue it, and they'll, you know, some wild rumour.

[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.840]
It was a guy sounded like dark, complex to me.

[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.260]
I don't want to give him that dark, complex to business, but he sounded like dark, complex to me.

[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:35.220]
The caller giving us the breathless news that he just saw on Channel 10 News about the school teacher that's been charged in the sex case with a 14 year old boy and all these other kids and a cocaine and the car and all these things, all of these things.

[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:47.500]
And assuming, of course, assuming it with, even though he only heard a little piece, assuming it was one of the teachers in the array in the second on the, what you call it clubs on the swing clubs.

[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:55.340]
And I said, well, I really find it hard to believe and when you find out a little bit more, when you know what you're talking about, call us back, click and that was the end of the call.

[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.720]
And of course, he never did call us back and come to find out with this.

[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.220]
Was this teacher from the Silverlake's Middle School, was she one involved in the other thing?

[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.520]
No.

[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.200]
No, she was not.

[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.340]
But again, that's the kind of irresponsible jackasses.

[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.460]
Thank you so much, Tommy, that you know, we'll call up a talk show and just, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.520]
And don't know what they're talking about.

[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:20.400]
In fact, I guarantee you, if you listen to the talk shows, any talk show, this station, any station, 90% of the people are calling having got any idea what they're talking about.

[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.600]
So it's up to the host, the middle man, the PIMP.

[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.820]
It's up to us to like try to, you know, referee in between and figure out who might actually know what they're talking about, which this guy did not.

[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.420]
In fact, are you all an apology?

[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.460]
But you do have to understand that this is also part of the American way.

[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.980]
The assumption is automatic.

[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:48.780]
The assumption is absolutely automatic that if somebody is, you know, involved in some kind of a sexual scandal, then any other sex story that comes down to PIC, it must be them.

[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.500]
Swing clubs, oh yeah, well, she must have been doing 14-year-old kids, students, et cetera, and so on.

[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.200]
Were we right?

[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.480]
No.

[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.080]
No, sorry.

[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.040]
Sorry, pal.

[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.100]
Sorry, am I misinformed, dark, and plucking, listening friend.

[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.300]
Boy, were you expecting me to eat this stuff, by the way?

[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.240]
Huh?

[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.060]
Oh my god.

[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.320]
Seriously, this isn't a joke, isn't it?

[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.700]
I might try the tomato.

[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.960]
Oh, no, god.

[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.020]
Oh yeah, straight in the old bucket. Are you kidding me?

[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.360]
Just say, it put it in the bucket. That's what I say.

[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.220]
Man, you don't think I would eat that crap?

[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.960]
Yeah, my dog wouldn't eat that.

[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.240]
But thanks for the effort anyway.

[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.180]
I'm not going to say anything about it, not yet.

[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.160]
Unless, of course, that is, I don't get those dolphin tickets.

[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.880]
Where is Fat Boy, why the way with those tickets?

[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.460]
You wouldn't supposed to bring me today?

[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.160]
You know, this is the kind of crap that goes on in this place.

[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.520]
Here is a guy that, generally speaking, we're not too fond of the beginning with.

[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.560]
At least, George hates him like poison. I don't care.

[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.140]
He's a little bit of fun during the hockey season with his sabers bull crap, you know?

[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.160]
Because he reminds me of Rick Jenner-Wetpy for Lost the Weight and the Suspenders.

[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.640]
And he comes limping in here, you know, Fat Boy.

[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.500]
But came in here begging for the dolphin buffalo bills tickets today that I had my season tickets

[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.040]
sitting here, those primo seats that I got and my purple preferred parking pass.

[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.940]
And he, oh, I'll pay for him, whatever you want.

[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.860]
And without even batting an eyelash, being the great guy that I am, I just reached into the potpile.

[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.680]
I pulled off the dolphin bills tickets.

[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.660]
I reached into my parking pass, then there, pulled out the parking pass.

[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.080]
Here you go, Fat Boy. I don't mind any money for it. Here you go.

[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.620]
Because I happen to be a great guy.

[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.980]
I asked this fat putt wacker for a little bit of a favor.

[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.100]
For a guy who works out there at MIA, one of my porter friends out there at the airport who practically beg me,

[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.140]
hasn't been a dolphin game in about 100 years, wants to go to a game.

[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.940]
I said, hey, I'll work on it. No problem after all.

[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.960]
We're the dolphin station.

[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.060]
Okay, Pally, whatever you need. Well, okay, Pally.

[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.080]
That's Fat Boy, okay?

[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.920]
On two legs.

[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.220]
And not walking too well these days either kind of waddling sideways.

[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.760]
Must be those rock trips to Hylia.

[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.820]
That must be what's getting to him.

[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.360]
So we're in Halemaay tickets, Fat Boy.

[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.760]
And by the way, that stuff in a waist pass, can I? I'm serious.

[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.560]
That's...

[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.980]
Oh my God.

[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.300]
And you're eating it. That's the worst part.

[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.700]
I'm pulling the meat out of it.

[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.660]
Yeah.

[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.100]
The bread is really stale.

[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.600]
And what?

[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.280]
How can you achieve that?

[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.200]
That is the worst crap that has ever come into this building.

[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.940]
It is.

[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.560]
We could bring stuff from the dumpster, you know,

[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.560]
where the old parts are in a condo building next door.

[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.140]
We could bring stuff from their dumpster that's been there since last year,

[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.680]
and I guarantee you that it'll be a fresher and probably tastier than that swill

[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.940]
that you've got on that plate right now.

[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.880]
I wouldn't consider touching that.

[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.360]
And anyway, so we got this story, and I'm sure that probably somewhere out in

[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.740]
Radio Land there will be, you know, this reminds me of the story in the New England, wasn't it?

[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.600]
In Boston, where the teacher, remember she had the 14 or 15-year-old kid,

[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.980]
and he killed her husband because, yeah, because they were madly in love,

[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.840]
and she said, hey, it'll be a good idea to get him out of the way.

[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.260]
Okay, whatever you say, honey.

[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.520]
And then of course, in Seattle, wasn't it up there somewhere in a great Northwest,

[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.780]
in the Northeast, in the Northwest?

[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.100]
That's where they got the problems.

[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.460]
Up there in a great Northwest, we had the school teacher, and they put her in the slimer

[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.520]
for Dillon with the minor, and then they let her out, and she's Dillon again.

[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.320]
And every time she gets out on probation, they're Dillon again.

[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.100]
Now, the sad part about this one, I mean, the whole story is really sick.

[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:24.880]
Hollywood resident Beth Friedman was charged with three counts of indecency in the salt.

[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.080]
They haven't found her yet, by the way.

[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.880]
She's supposed to be turning herself in, but as of the morning news this morning,

[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.420]
I like the news stations. She hadn't turned herself in yet.

[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.900]
Three counts of indecency in the salt, two counts of unlawful sexual activity with the minor,

[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.000]
and one kind of contributing to the delinquency of a child.

[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.820]
And we'll get into the whole story here because it's really sorted and grotesque.

[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.060]
But I bet you that somebody out there will probably defend it.

[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.620]
Somebody who also finds it disgusting and nauseating that the adults went to the swim club

[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.640]
with other adults behind closed doors and private.

[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.000]
And by the way, remind me during the break to tell you about my call from Rome Kent yesterday,

[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.660]
who didn't hear my comments on the air, obviously, about how great it would be if he did some lowering on some of the things

[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.620]
that I asked him to do like months ago, because he was too busy talking to MSNBC,

[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.780]
that they wanted him to be on the air to discuss this swim club thing.

[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.540]
Oh, God. You know, it must be nice to be famous, right, Norm?

[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.460]
It must be nice to be famous and the desk that we wanted to talk about stuff that...

[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.900]
Nine minutes after 10 at 5.60 WQM yesterday, they're on the weathertownest that,

[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.300]
even though we haven't had a big hurricane here yet this year,

[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.240]
it's looking really grim between now and the end of hurricane season.

[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.580]
Oh, you actually put some of that in your mouth?

[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.540]
Look at that. George found the basket. Uh-oh!

[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.160]
Oh, yeah.

[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.580]
How you airing shit like this?

[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.460]
Where's my soup?

[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.520]
There's Chicago, right at the same end,

[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.800]
you put it up with this one last hand now.

[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.780]
Did she forgot what the map was?

[00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.880]
She's been using the best of those it can see now.

[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.040]
Stupid, stupid, stupid idiotic!

[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.060]
She's been using any gun till we want to rope that it see now.

[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.780]
And she will run, run, run, give a bonus and I'll pick her away.

[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.900]
Oh, my God, do the photos, do the videos.

[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:18.100]
Well, we thought all of them up and then he started getting wise and she never died.

[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.740]
Now she acted so fine and since she made her picture fine,

[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.320]
she was thinking there's a real result she was down.

[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.400]
But that's just on to me,

[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.480]
or any pictures you put in for some photos.

[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.360]
Go now!

[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:36.120]
Hey, I will run, run, run, give a bonus and I'll pick her away.

[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.180]
Go run, give a bonus and she will run, run, run, give a bonus and I'll pick her away.

[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.740]
15 to 560 WCM.

[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.640]
By the way, just remember all your kids out there, the American F and W maybe.

[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.800]
It's not so bad to get blown away,

[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.580]
but it's real evil to get blown.

[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.100]
Just keep that in mind.

[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.720]
So anyway, getting back to this story,

[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.800]
teacher charged in teen sex case,

[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.620]
police issue warrant for arrest Hollywood.

[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.380]
Already consumed by a messy ethical misconduct case involving two,

[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.060]
not one, but kind of two-broward county youth teachers.

[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.440]
School board officials were dealt another crisis, another blow.

[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.260]
Can we say that?

[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:08.580]
No!

[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.540]
On Wednesday, when state prosecutors charged a silver-like middle school teacher

[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.220]
with having sex with one of her students.

[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:14.840]
Hey!

[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.140]
Hollywood resident, Beth Friedman 40.

[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.160]
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.020]
One more.

[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:21.560]
Oh!

[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.000]
Was charged with three counts of indecent assault, two counts of unlawful sexual activity

[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.120]
with a minor, and one kind of contributing to the delinquency of a child.

[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:35.220]
All but the last count are felonies that carry a maximum sentence of up to 15 years each.

[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.140]
If she's convicted, said Sergeant Roni Mangins,

[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.500]
spoke to the spokesman for the Hollywood Police Department.

[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.760]
Police issued a warrant for arrest as a late-wend, and this morning,

[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.780]
Friedman did not turn herself into Hollywood police.

[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.940]
The charges follow an investigation of Friedman that began after a parent filed

[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:55.020]
a complaint against her, and the June 13 complaint, the parent's son told police that he started having sex

[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.340]
with Friedman two years ago when he was 14.

[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.020]
Boy!

[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.500]
And in her seventh grade class.

[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.540]
Police had that the relationship ended in June when the teen was 16.

[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.580]
Because of his age, police would not disclose the names of the parent or the student.

[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.200]
Although his mother was on the, with the face not shown this morning,

[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.880]
looking very anorexic this morning.

[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.900]
On the Channel 7 news.

[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.520]
Which I don't watch, by the way, but I did see it.

[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.940]
Silverlite's middle principal William Bell said,

[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.020]
Friedman, a Spanish teacher at the North Lauderdale School,

[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.240]
resigned in August 4th, he declined to comment further.

[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.380]
Broward County School District spokesman Joe Don Zele said,

[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.060]
Friedman did not have contact with the students after the June 13 complaint,

[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.060]
school-edged June 17th, how convenient.

[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.640]
One former student of Friedman expressed disbelief on hearing of the charges.

[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.560]
I never really thought that she'd do that because she was always the nicest teacher.

[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.760]
Don't you love hearing those things?

[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:43.800]
That's what he said.

[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.200]
Oh yeah, right, that's what the other kid said too.

[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.180]
She was so nice. God was she nice.

[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:49.380]
Huh?

[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.220]
Well, there's a great land in here which I'll get to.

[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.800]
But it's always like Ted Bundy, he was such a nice guy, you know?

[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:55.560]
Yeah, seriously.

[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.660]
God, these were such nice people.

[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.260]
David Berkowitz, my god, a mild-mannered guy.

[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.420]
Larry King's got his tongue still stuck in his back dome.

[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.220]
Anyway, I never really thought she'd do that because she was always the nicest teacher

[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.240]
said Rachel Abbott, who was an eighth grader at Silverlite's middle last year.

[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.400]
She was different than the other teachers. She let people bring candy and chewing gum and stuff.

[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.820]
She let people bring candy. How do you like that, huh?

[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.120]
Oh, I'll get to it. I'll find it out here somewhere. What was her favorite line?

[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.120]
One on a lot of top, little boy.

[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:28.340]
She was different than the other teachers. It says she let people bring candy and chewing gum and stuff

[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.040]
and you can tell her anything.

[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.120]
She tried to have fun with the kids that said.

[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.460]
And evidently, they agreed.

[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:35.560]
Yes.

[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:43.080]
Only one problem with the wilder, a lot of problems with it because we get into the drugs and the car and all the other stuff.

[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.840]
But there's one question she should have been asked.

[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.280]
How young is two youngs?

[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:51.700]
David Bolgan shots a four-letter day attorney representing treatment that she walked into his office on Wednesday requested representation.

[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.680]
I'm not going to count on the specifics of this case to live an opportunity to look at what the state has.

[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.880]
He says, I can only confirm that I will represent her assuming she needs it.

[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.900]
And guess what, David? She needs it.

[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.280]
The charges came one day after the school board voted to suspend.

[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:10.420]
And it goes on to think about the teachers with a swing club as if somehow that's got some relationship, which of course it does not.

[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.760]
But the word sex is involved there. So naturally, everybody's up in arms.

[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:21.880]
School official space, a similar case in 1997 when two Piper High coaches were charged with having sex with a 15-year-old student in 1995.

[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:23.740]
15.

[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:30.880]
How young is two youngs?

[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.800]
Okay, marijuana. We're not too upset about that. I actually see N.C. King. Are we upset about that?

[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:36.360]
Yes.

[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.380]
Two other teens who gave statements said they received drugs and gifts from Friedman.

[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.980]
One youth associated with Friedman was given a car, which I think this is the one that they were talking about, but they don't know that in the Sun Sentinel.

[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:47.820]
Police said.

[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.180]
Parents of another teen said they think they're also had sex with Friedman. They intend to pursue the matter.

[00:14:53.860 --> 00:15:03.040]
Residents of Emerald Oaks, the condominium complex where Friedman lived, said adolescent boys frequently stayed the night at Friedman's house, said Hollywood police detective Kurt Navarro.

[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:11.680]
M.M. Franco, president of the Emerald Oaks condominium association, said two adolescent boys, and another woman thought to be in her 40s, lived at Friedman's home for several months until June.

[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:17.360]
The condominium board told Friedman they had to move her out because they were not related to her. She had to move them out. When it got moved them out.

[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:25.680]
If these allegations are true, I'm sorry for her and I'm sorry for the kids, Franco said, but I'm especially sorry for the school system.

[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.400]
It's another black eye for them, another slap in the pus for them.

[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:37.440]
She tried to have fun with the kids is what it said. She succeeded. Yeah, she succeeded.

[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:45.920]
Navarro said a 19 year old man recently told him that he had sex with Friedman three years ago, which would have made him 16, also a minor of course.

[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.920]
She ought to move to Pennsylvania. The minors are big there, like in Pittsburgh.

[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:59.400]
Police suspect other former students had similar relationships with the teacher and asked at any moment of information, contact investigators with a number here, which you can get in the newspaper.

[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:13.360]
So there you go. There's the story. There's the story of a lovely lady. I mean, I mean, here we go. A 40 year old teacher. She did a little with 14 and 15 and 60 year old, 16 year old students and given them drugs and buying the kid cars.

[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:21.660]
I guess maybe when she bought the one kid a car and he was like 14 or 15 because I think all 14 year old kids out there need a car. You know what I'm saying? Yeah.

[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:30.240]
I mean, you know, it's never too early to have one because sooner or later it'll be legal for you to drive it or even just drive it, you know, just for practice until you get your license.

[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.560]
And evidently he was driving in a lot and a car too.

[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.080]
What a great story.

[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:47.020]
Yeah. To these are the kind of people. If it were me, if you just asked me, I found out that all these allegations were substantiated, of course, which would take about five minutes, I guess.

[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:52.260]
I would say, okay, 15 years on each count sounds about right to me. What other 10 counts? 150 years sounds real good to me.

[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.060]
Doesn't that give you great confidence?

[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:07.920]
And doesn't it also make you wonder how the parents can be like so oblivious? Oh, yeah, schoolteacher because we know they make all that big money.

[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:12.940]
And all school teachers, I know what I was going to school all the teachers were buying all the kids cars. Very commonplace.

[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:19.160]
Was it? No. Sure. Corvette XKE's ML kind of good stuff.

[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:27.480]
Here's a call in Miami. Hello. Me. I don't. Yes, sir. Yeah. Come. Come away from that.

[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:38.620]
If you saw the news last night, all the weathermen, including your Don, no, are having orgasms on the TV because they got too tropical depression.

[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:45.220]
Oh, no. Yeah. One just came off of Africa and they're already jumping up and now saying it's not the top of a storm later on.

[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:52.060]
Yeah. And it's all. Why is it that so many of the problems we have originate in Africa? You know, then they run to two weeks away from us.

[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:58.440]
Uh-huh. And they're now saying, well, have you ever noticed that? There's so many of the things that devastate this country. They start in Africa.

[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:02.300]
I'm telling you. And then they went up over here. They worked their way west. Yeah.

[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:09.920]
They're like they're jumping up and down. They're just getting on us. This guy is falling. This guy is falling. Yeah. I mean, they're just jumping up and down.

[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:15.060]
I'm surprised that Don, because he's easily the level-headed one. Maybe they're just desperate for ratings on Channel 10.

[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.560]
He was even surprised because I never watched him. He was the first story in last night's news on Channel 10.

[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.800]
Yeah. Show more in the tropics. Oh my God. Oh well.

[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.580]
Okay. Well, band down a hatches, Pat.

[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.360]
Yeah. Take it easy.

[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:32.300]
And if that boy comes knocking out the door, kick his ass out. Where is my dolphin tickets, Mr. Ratton's the fun?

[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:38.620]
Oh, boy. He has something. I told you. I will not do that commercial. We've already passed the word along to him.

[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:48.160]
I will not advertise for places that provide food that the dish out food like that. Okay. That is inedible. That's the third three stripes in your out. Okay. You're out.

[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.960]
You've had it. T bonito.

[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:57.020]
So I need to do is associate my name with a place like that where we're throwing the food in the waste basket and people are like barfing their guts out here.

[00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.000]
Nice going, Pat. Boy, you know how to find them. See you in high-lea, sweetheart.

[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.340]
Yeah. When you're going to get that, you want on here. Maybe you can get a trade-out.

[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.640]
It is on here. Oh, like I said, he's probably got one.

[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.920]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.840]
I'm going to be on the POM 5, 60 on a mobile one line. Come on. Let's get pissed off and part up today, huh?

[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:24.980]
Let's get that girl I called yesterday. She owes me an apology. The schwarz who I called in yesterday trying to tie this teacher this bet-freedman and say that she was the one for he owes her an apology.

[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:31.020]
Michael Mayo. He still owes Dave Halberstam an apology. It's apology Thursday here at QA and let's go.

[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.220]
And right now we want to apologize for something even though it's not my fault.

[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.520]
Yeah, I want to apologize for that.

[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:46.000]
2 o'clock this afternoon, hangs out there in San Diego, you know, do an ESPN stuff because we always come second because TV of course is first. I understand that, Humper.

[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.540]
And manages out there so we couldn't have him.

[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.460]
And as desperate as we are and again, Bluff Lindsay put a note in here, he said, please apologize to the care audience for my putting.

[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.340]
On the year today between 2 and 4 30 was bad enough last night, 7 to 10, which I didn't hear.

[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.420]
Although you know something like I've said before the sports nerds, I heard a little bit of Zim for yesterday.

[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.740]
I've always told you this with the sports nerds, it makes no difference who they put on.

[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.460]
They don't have to beg for calls like I do every day here with his great highly rated show.

[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.720]
They don't have to beg for people to have verbal intercourse with them because it's the same bunch of nerds.

[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.240]
What do you think about that linebacker with the biking?

[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.020]
And it's the most unbelievable.

[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.320]
All they need is somebody there to respond, whether it's a monkey, whether it's whatever it is.

[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:29.900]
Cheers to that.

[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.300]
Yeah, even him, like I said, monkey mouth.

[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.400]
So he'll be on from 2 to 4 30 and we apologize deeply for that.

[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.200]
I mean, that's probably the most embarrassing thing in the history of this radio station.

[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.400]
Then we got Clarence Dero and Orlando Elziger.

[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.140]
He's going to be on after that from 4 30 to 6.

[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.020]
And then we got 6 to 8 hurricane, a hurricane hotline.

[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.080]
And Manditz from San Diego 8 to 10 o'clock tonight, the Mad Dog.

[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:53.740]
Yeah.

[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.820]
We'll give you a little bit of respect to be back to the radio station 8 to 10 tonight.

[00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.560]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.180]
I'm crossed by the Mad Dog.

[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.940]
Mobile in Miami. Hello.

[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.500]
Yes, sir. Turn that radio off, sir, because I know it's going to be a short call but nevertheless.

[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.720]
It sounds like one of our chronicleers. Yes.

[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.900]
I have a question for you.

[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:15.020]
What do you think about these seats that you got suspended because...

[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.740]
Okay, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.060]
What do you think about Abe Lincoln? Okay, he's got a bad headache too.

[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:23.060]
Okay, get with the program. Okay, Julio, get with it.

[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.460]
Get a little update. Stick your head into the internet. Just stick your head in there.

[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.640]
Or just stick your head in your neck.

[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.280]
Find out what's going on in the world.

[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:29.940]
Jackass.

[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.620]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a mobile one.

[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.380]
I'm still waiting for those two apology calls.

[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.320]
And I also end the apology from Sherry and Boca.

[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.380]
Remember Sherry and Boca were discussing lettering a couple of days ago.

[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.280]
Suck it around, suck it around, suck it around, suck it around.

[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.860]
And then hitting me up for back feet boy tickets with that on half-four.

[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.180]
Did she ever call my apology?

[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.880]
No. Straighten the record out. No.

[00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.480]
No. God. I'm embarrassed for some of you people are really in.

[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.280]
You're so irresponsible. Your behavior is just so unacceptable.

[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.360]
And then you just run away from it.

[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.940]
Just like Michael Holden-Mail. What a jackass.

[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.060]
Oh there's that ugly Christina Aguilar.

[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.800]
I hate to break the news to you guys, but Lucinda Grip, okay.

[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.760]
She is really grotesque.

[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.400]
26 past 10 at 560 WQAN.

[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.980]
Oh, Alonso. You're so big.

[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:29.780]

[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.000]

[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.360]
the story you know it happens it does happen but when we get to them cocaine

[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.760]
part that's when i got upset the marijuana part didn't bother me but the

[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.680]
cocaine part that's where i'd rather love the uh... white line

[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.340]
yeah i mean that this was what what's wrong with her having sex and enjoying

[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.040]
something at all man yeah

[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.820]
this is a matter of course you try to have fun with the kids

[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.580]
that's right this is what we can't do this country for

[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.600]
yeah i think some of the ice and ice behind this

[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.320]
yeah if the problems are

[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:04.600]
are coming in from uh... africa you know these storms are things that come

[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.160]
in the market and the market and the problem is back to africa okay

[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.520]
but we're gonna work on it today haha haha we're sending all the problems back

[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.380]
to africa is what we're gonna do

[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.940]
because even our dark complex it for a degree that a lot of bad stuff comes

[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.040]
here from africa

[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.920]

[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.620]
pound five sixty on the mobile one line

[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.520]
but i have some soup today i can't get rid of cannot this this cold man

[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.920]

[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.620]
a little bit of a nasal and i know it's how come nobody is coming in that

[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.880]

[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.040]
bad day all red and uh... can you see that not as bad today

[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.240]
so maybe i'm getting a little bit better but that scratchy throughout god

[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.580]
is that annoying or course it could be allergies let's do is a doc in today

[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:53.060]
not

[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.520]

[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.420]
amazing is that you notice like yesterday

[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.260]
none of the parents call in about any of these things that's why i know that

[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.320]
nobody cares about schools and about education and about your kids really in

[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:23.660]
general

[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:27.520]
that nobody calls about any of these things i remember years and years ago

[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.600]
and i was on k a t

[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.700]

1045 at 560 WQM

[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.680]
subsidies for all here's a good letter to the editor and one of the papers

[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.720]
this morning I think they're old

[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.760]
I can't tell

[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.680]
Arnold letterer of Pembert Pines writes if our elected representatives think

[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.680]
it's appropriate to spend our much needed tax dollars

[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.520]
so that the owners of sports teams can pay their glamorous athletes

[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.640]
million dollar salary

[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.500]
only trust it out is there any way that owners of other businesses can use

[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.580]
tax dollars to pay employees extraordinary salaries

[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.600]
good question Arnold letterer of Pembert Pines

[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.280]
good letter of course it'll fall on deaf ears

[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.560]
because the sports there is they just we can't do enough for them to build

[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.620]
them play toys so what do you think about bethreadman for a

[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.880]
teacher of the year huh i'm changing my attitude about this we don't know for

[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.620]
sure that she gave them drugs that's just you know let's give her the

[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.080]
benefit of the doubt if we're given Tony Martin the benefit of the doubt

[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.000]
let's give bethreadman the benefit of the doubt

[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.940]
we're pretty sure that she had sex with these kids but like so far it's

[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.800]
unanimous all the young people call into this would say that they would

[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.340]
love to have certain of their teachers although i'm looking at bethreadman

[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.040]
to be honest with you well maybe she looked a little better two years ago

[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:21.300]
you think so oh what was their uh great what's our everything you know what

[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.900]
what was their great point average how much she has a teacher in

[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.200]
in addition to all this crap now you're starting to confuse it with that

[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.540]
kind of crap okay i'm sure that they had passing grades and what

[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:34.820]
they were doing with her yeah i'm sure in the beginning they probably

[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.300]
were inexperienced and not saying that they're she's supposed to be teaching

[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:41.240]
them right she taught him how to perfect their trade the tools of their

[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.300]
trade the creative their tools at that age huh sure there you go

[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.300]
five said we had all the lines pulled up here when we went to the break but

[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.960]
now we're back down to two again is that once again all summer long we've

[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.880]
gone on like this they like to make it a hell of five times harder to do the

[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.680]
show that's okay i'm used to it doesn't phase me in the least

[00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:01.500]
that crappy food is in a waste basket five six seven oh five sixty

[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.300]
pound five sixty on the mobile one line here's plantation hello

[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:09.520]

[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.240]
nerds it never ceases to amazing i agree with you 100 percent that there can be

[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:18.540]
that many people that can sustain shows that hour after hour i have you and i have

[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.940]
one other call on here now and that's it that's all i got on the board and i

listened to these sports shows on his station and we've got twice as many people

[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:28.140]
listening as those shows the ratings show at month after month book after book

[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:32.320]
and yet there is an endless supply of these nerds one after another after another

[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:37.800]
asking the most in name the most miniscule the most the idiotic things that anybody in the world

[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:42.640]
could care about and the interesting thing is i've always been interested in sports all my life

[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:47.420]
but i couldn't care i couldn't care less about listening to the interracuse of every single

[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:52.440]
thing i over and over and then draft and the on and off it's on the level anyway the main thing i

[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:56.580]
call about you nailed something yesterday really serious about the other side of education from

[00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:00.660]
this teacher thing and and that's the kids you you pointed something out i never hear anybody

[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:05.280]
mention and i i do it all the time at the risk of sounding like a racist about hearing the kids on

[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.880]
the corner talk and you couldn't understand the word to get the how come i didn't get a response

[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:14.400]
to that well you got tried to get it from me but i couldn't get in and i you know i see this all

[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.840]
the time and i think just like you do i think where are these kids going to wind up where are they

[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:23.180]
going what are they going to do i want to always go into the group and say what do you kids want to

[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.860]
do with your life where do you want to go what do you want to do because it's it's generation

[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:32.680]
after generation and it's truly serious i mean it's a serious serious subject not everybody can

[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:36.880]
play professional sports or be a rap star you know i mean it just doesn't work out that way exactly

[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:41.640]
and as a teacher myself i think to myself when i'm walking to the halls and i'm looking at the kids

[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.780]
and i'm talking to them in there and they're driving and they're shucking and they're doing it and

[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:49.060]
i'm thinking to myself what are you going to do three years now five can you be you're going to be

[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:53.000]
on the corner it's going to start all over again right how do we do it better it's not going to

[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.580]
help by screwing the kids screwing the kids yeah but white america loves this man you know i was

[00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:01.660]
thinking yesterday and i forgot to bring it up like donovan baili and all the canadian uh

[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:06.420]
yeah the runner runner uh if you ever heard him speak he speaks perfect english just like you and

[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:11.120]
i are speaking now anytime i see black people in the canada of our canadian they speak exactly like

[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:15.980]
we're speaking uh the hockey players like heaven weeks who used to be uh the backup goalie for

[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:19.900]
the panthers and peter were real we've had him on the station many many times they speak perfect

[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:23.800]
english they don't speak bubonics they don't speak with some kind of ghetto dialect

[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:28.920]
that there this idea this brainwashing the idea that somehow a that black people don't have the

[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.720]
ability to articulate and speak like white people like uh you know real english is bullcrap or b

[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.600]
that somehow uh we're trying to expect them to be like whitey you know like like it's a cultural

[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:41.100]
thing that we're trying to coerce them to be like god nothing to do with like being like whitey

[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.540]
and has to do with speaking proper english and being able to uh do something in life

[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:48.920]
i agree with you and i feel very hamstrung about that i think that i'm in a position to do something

[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:52.600]
about it and i i can't do any more than the people who are in my classes and try to make

[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.200]
make it clear to everybody that everybody needs to have a command of the language and

[00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.640]

really pound away at it and work at it just like a bett Friedman says keep working on it keep

[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:06.340]
pounding it now what she said hey she deserves her day in court and then put her in a slumber for 20

[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:10.340]
years no i don't know i mean most of this audience so far thinks that the diddler in your teachers

[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:14.980]
okay the cocaine was the stupid part you know that was the bad part why why wasn't it just good

[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:21.420]
enough you know well of course wouldn't see that picture what well she doesn't look particularly

[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:27.020]
attractive okay she doesn't look i mean she's 40 and looks like the teachers i had the hot for were

[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:32.100]
you know wait yeah much younger i mean this and maybe it's just a bad picture the papers are

[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:37.720]
notorious for that maybe this is a very unattractive picture or maybe you know it's some of that

[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:43.720]
that could be it maybe she had like sweetened the pot a little bit so to speak here's the mobile

[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:49.060]
and sunrise hello yeah no one of the things that's been kind of left out about this is i noticed

[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:53.360]
some news that she's consulting one with her lawyer at the when she's gonna turn herself in do you

[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.880]
think that that had been a guy did it in a couple of what he called a picture already did oh somebody

[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.260]
said she already did it's been on some of the station to have like a real news thing operation

[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:04.920]
she i guess you can find i just find it funny that if it was a male teacher would he be able to

[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:08.680]
determine when to turn himself in or would they be busting down his door to get the you're right

[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.920]
they would have knocked it well i guess she wasn't home i mean i'm sure that they were i don't

[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.780]
know how that works all right you're right if it was a guy that would have come in knocked the

[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:19.060]
doors down ahead channel seven years and we're saying his would have been hovering over the

[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:24.220]
furnace and got forbidden with maybe if it was a guy in a one of his male students god knows

[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:28.880]
what what i have oh boy wow all right just why i only have only a Columbus i think we have to

[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:34.480]
worry about that oh you know god bless the Catholic okay pal that's what they say in Ireland

[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.840]
that's what they say it's that nagel and laundry

[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.400]
blessed the catlicks don't be picking on them catlicks by the way they could very upset about that

[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:49.960]
they can't deal with the truth because they're very very well brainwashed five six seven oh five

[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:54.940]
sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one i just keep making babies okay just keep making babies and

[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:58.020]
if you're gonna have sex make sure you make a baby otherwise you're gonna burn in hell

[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.060]
just keep that in mind well i'll tell you one thing because i know i'm gonna go to hell if

[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:06.000]
the research of place that's been guaranteed already how many listings over the years

[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:11.440]
i bet you're going into a lot of catlicks down here because god almighty i have i could be wrong

[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:15.520]
but i think from what i hear about all the horny catlicks they're just screwing up a storm

[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.380]
everything that moves and i don't think they're making babies every time they do it

[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.400]
you know i tried to tell the pope it doesn't work that way you know and uh

[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:28.940]

care don't you understand this is the most in different place in the world they just don't give a

[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.700]
crap and then you get a whole bunch of kids you know getting shot up out there a collar bind and

[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:20.040]
little in colorado and we have a national a week or two of morning and everybody puts on this big

[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.380]
act and that goes back to the way it was before they don't give a crap right then they go back to

[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:27.260]
school that's why we have crappy education because nobody here cares nobody makes it a priority if

[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:31.580]
the public cared about that they wouldn't they wouldn't allow it to be like it is quick question and

[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:35.880]
involving something you were talking about last last week the episode on the plane with the guy

[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:39.460]
you used to know and then he blew your right off i mean not that i used to know but i mean i had

[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:43.420]
a conversation a very friendly conversation with him one time and then it's like uh who the hell

[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:47.600]
do you want you know i miss the beginning part did i do you say you have been traveling with him

[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.620]
on the same flight for years yeah for the last two years i mean he goes to Toronto every weekend

[00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:55.720]
because i guess he lives up there and works down here and then i go up you know like 15 or 20

[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:59.560]
weekends a year because i love it up there and if seen him all the time in the airport for both

[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:03.820]
coming up and going back in the no conversation finally for whatever reason we get this conversation

[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:08.340]
he's a big maple leaf fan he knows who i am he's watched the tv show and we have this great conversation

[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:12.240]
and like three weeks later i see him up in the airport in Toronto it's like uh he saw a ghost

[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:18.120]
it's just unbelievable that people you just have like no social skills there's not a function out

[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:22.460]
there and i'm thinking and i'm thinking to myself okay so maybe he told somebody had a conversation

[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:26.800]
with me and the person said oh well you know he's a faggot or whatever and i'm thinking to myself if

[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:31.840]
that's the case if i'm at hot for his body or something which he's you know not that great but if i

[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:36.120]
were in a little bit slow aren't i after two and a half years of sitting there in the god day

[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:41.460]
mirror port waiting in the lounge yeah it's uh give me a break come back unbelievable have a good one

[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:46.240]
there and you two yeah we're very slowly i'm real sinister but wait when you least expect it

[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:51.600]
but i just like George he hasn't expected all these years but one of these days when you least

[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:57.940]
expected George been a pound time ain't going to be me five six five six seven oh five sixty

[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:02.740]
pound five sixty on the AT&T line it would be so rewarding to see a whole bunch of people on these

[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:06.540]
lines that have them hold on during the break that would really be exciting yeah oh that got the

[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:12.040]
biggest laugh of the week yeah have a whole bunch of people calling in here with something to say

[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:15.820]
about anything in the world and actually hold on here like they really wanted to speak that would

[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:19.800]
be that would make me feel like it was worth coming in this morning because i think that that

[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.980]
little adventure i had done the hallway a few minutes ago i think that was just the first

[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:27.780]
in a multi-part series today that which is a good sign you know when you got a little flu a

[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:32.280]
little cold like that and you start like crazy that's excellent man get it out of your system i mean

[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:38.120]
heavy duty yeah but what does uh anyway huh i guess he's hyperventilating because they're desperate

[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:42.780]
eleven fourteen and five sixty qm and i see exactly what i said before during the break i begged

[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:46.640]
i pleaded i tried to be a nice guy i said what would make me really happy was to get a whole

[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:50.200]
bunch of calls on there and they would hang on during the break one person held up how young is

[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:55.380]
too young you know what i'm saying one person held on and the fact that this is three minutes and

[00:52:55.380 --> 00:53:00.560]
forty seconds will probably not encourage the other one to hang on there this hanger we're on

[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:06.800]
over that's not a model before painful but how we close it yeah or if not too bad just

[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:12.760]
someone in here being just care my god's god baby as usual just reach in and twist and care my

I'm a big pair of heads, so now I smoke to the joints when I get up.

[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:09.980]
In the car I smoke to the joints.

[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:14.000]
I smoke to the joints when I play video games.

[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.280]
And at every 10,000 points I smoke to the joints.

[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:20.400]
I smoke to the joints, and it's time of reason.

[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:22.460]
And two in time, whoa!

[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.420]

I smoke to the joints, and I play video games.

[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:30.940]
It makes me feel alright.

[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:35.040]
I smoke to the joints, and it's time of reason.

[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:37.380]
And two in time, whoa!

[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:38.380]
Wrong!

[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:41.180]
I smoke to the joints, and four I smoke to the joints.

[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.380]
And then I smoke to Mars.

[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:46.320]
That's what I do.

[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:56.340]
I smoke to the joints, and four I smoke to the joints.

[00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:00.720]
And then I smoke to the joints, and it's time of reason.

[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:06.040]
I smoke to the joints, and then I smoke to Mars.

[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:13.340]
I smoke to the joints, and I play video games.

[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:14.040]
Whoa!

[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:29.140]
I smoke to the joints.

[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:32.440]
I smoke to the joints, and it's time of reason.

[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:35.780]
Tight little island full of gay romance.

[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.940]

8, 11, 18, and 5, 60 WDQ.

[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.580]

[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:14.840]
5, 6, 7.

[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:16.440]
Let's talk about the Minnesota Vikings,

[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:17.760]

[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.640]
and let's talk about the San Diego Chargers,

[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:21.520]
and let's talk about the...all that crap.

[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.280]
All you want to do that?

[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:22.680]
No.

[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:26.000]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.000]
pound, 5, 60 on the 18 T line.

[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.180]
Here's a mobile and bouquet. Hello.

[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:30.240]
Hello, Niel.

[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:31.400]
Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing?

[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.220]
Okay. Listen, let me ask you something.

[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:36.080]
Don't you think it's a little strange that, uh,

[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:39.000]
Hillary Clinton is running for the Senate up there

[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.420]
in New York, and all of a sudden,

[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:45.340]
that bill decides that he's going to pardon these bombers?

[00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:45.820]
No.

[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:46.760]
Okay?

[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:47.280]
No.

[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.560]
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:52.140]
Yeah. So why is Bill pardoning these bombers?

[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:53.000]
These Puerto Rican bombers...

[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:54.480]
They like the Puerto Rican,

[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:55.960]
they're going to make some of the 51st-day,

[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.260]
they've almost been both democratic.

[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:59.180]
Okay, do you agree with me on that one?

[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:00.220]
So I agree with you on what?

[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:03.180]
On the fact that it just seems all strange to them.

[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:03.820]
Why don't we...

[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:05.820]
To be honest with you, I don't want to...

[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:07.040]
Why don't we pardon, sir, if you want to...

[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:09.400]
Why do you keep asking me a question if you don't want to answer?

[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:10.220]
Have a nice day, sir.

[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:13.120]
I don't deal with people who ask rhetorical questions.

[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:14.900]
Okay? I don't care about Hillary.

[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.780]
I know that make come as a great shock to you.

[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:18.240]
I don't live in New York State.

[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:21.360]
They can make Hillary the governor, the queen, the senator,

[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:23.380]
the princess, the prince, the pauper.

[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:24.260]
I don't care what they do.

[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.880]
It's of no consequence to me.

[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:27.220]
None.

[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:28.860]
Zero. Zipity, doodah.

[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.240]
Do I make myself clear?

[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:31.920]
No. Okay.

[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:34.580]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.180]
on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:38.700]
Here's West Miami. Hello.

[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:40.440]
Hello, Neil. Good afternoon.

[00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:42.800]
Yes, sir. That's funny, because Hillary doesn't live in New York either.

[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:43.820]
Right, exactly.

[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:44.940]
But what do you care about?

[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:45.040]
What do you care?

[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:45.140]
What do you care?

[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:49.520]
Well, you know, it's a stepping stone because she's got political aspirations.

[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.280]
Just like the crap they were making up about after,

[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:54.860]
Bumma gets out with his term and he's going to go back to Arkansas

[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:55.500]
and run for...

[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.620]
Like all of a sudden, we got a royal family now, you know?

[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:58.660]
Well, what is that all about?

[00:58:58.920 --> 00:58:59.040]
Please.

[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:01.980]
Listen, that was unfortunate about the teacher, but, you know,

[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.540]
not the other two a week ago.

[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:04.880]
That's nobody's business, but this...

[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:05.920]
Well, what would you say unfortunate?

[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:08.540]
Now, how come nobody in this audience has got a real opinion?

[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:09.760]
We can make a joke out of it.

[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:12.760]
You know, 40-year-old woman has sex with a 14-year-old kid

[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.720]
and a bunch of other kids and have them live in her or a prokondo there

[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:18.280]
and she's buying them cars and providing them with cocaine

[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:20.380]
and LSD and God don't know what else.

[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:23.040]
There's thousands of other teachers that do a great job

[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:25.320]
and she's just, you know, now giving her, you know...

[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:27.340]
And nobody has any opinion about this.

[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:28.200]
Because nobody cares.

[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:28.780]
Why?

[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:30.240]
They're apathetic.

[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:32.100]
God Almighty, this is unbelievable.

[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:35.200]
And the only response we get is a bunch of young guys out there

[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.760]
and what's their teachers want to screw them, yes?

[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:39.240]
When Buri, I saw he was skating.

[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:42.300]
I remember about a month ago they said that a lot of the Russian players

[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:43.040]
were going to skate.

[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:43.320]
Yeah.

[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:45.680]
He didn't need permission from the team to do that, did he?

[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:47.820]
Did the team get any kind of release?

[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:49.160]
Is this on his own or is that not on his own?

[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.060]
No, it's not on his own.

[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:53.280]
He did it with the team's, uh, inferior, enthusiastic encouragement.

[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:57.620]
Because he was glad to see him and the first little semblance of hockey.

[00:59:57.620 --> 00:59:59.100]
Well, I got news for us, sir, if they...

[00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:04.520]
If he don't make a full recovery, we might as well burn your tickets out in the parking lot.

[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.060]
I hope he does, because he...

[01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:09.700]
And so do I, because going him is seeing him play is worth the price of the mission.

[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.920]
Well, I can't wait till October.

[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:11.740]
Okay, pal.

[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:12.300]
Thank you, Neil.

[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.260]
See him. Go, Leafs, go.

[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.140]
Fox and Maple Leaf hockey here today, huh?

[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:16.380]
No.

[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:18.440]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5.

[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:18.860]
I've got that.

[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:19.980]
Mike Johnson's in, fight up again.

[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:20.380]
Nice going.

[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.480]
Mike, leave me solid.

[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.260]
There you go.

[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.000]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:29.440]
I'm just going to keep repeating those numbers over and over and over again.

[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.520]
I'll go down the hall and do another number of my own,

[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.040]
because they just don't give a crap.

[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.440]
Here is a story if this happened anywhere else in the world.

[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:40.700]
On the highest rated talk show in town, this 40-year-old teacher screwing a 14-year-old boy.

[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:44.700]
Everybody in town to be on a phone talking about, have something to say about it.

[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.000]
These people, where they got nothing.

[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.640]
What the hell was that?

[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.240]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.380]
Yeah, that's going to goddamn traffic report.

[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:53.860]
Yeah.

[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:55.600]
God, that was good.

[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.620]
Oh, it's better having that come up in some pain in the ass bit that I got to cut off.

[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:02.260]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.800]
Do you have an opinion about anything?

[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:03.980]
No.

[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:07.920]
If the hurricane comes right through the middle of your neighborhood, will you care about that?

[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:08.160]
No.

[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:17.820]
Have you got an opinion on young black people speaking bubonics and that we don't teach them to speak proper English like God damn Dott of Inveilian Peter Warrell,

[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:21.900]
who may not be the greatest guy that hockey player that ever came down to fight, even though you like him a lot,

[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:23.820]
but nevertheless, he speaks perfect English.

[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.920]
Is there some reason that nobody cares about that?

[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:28.200]
Even my dark, complex friends.

[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.160]
Let me ask you.

[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.480]
Here's a mobile in Perine.

[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:32.780]
Hello.

[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:34.500]
Hey, Neil.

[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:34.980]
Yes, sir.

[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.380]
First time, long time.

[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:36.880]
All right.

[01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:38.480]
It's a pleasure to speak to you.

[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:38.960]
Yes, it is.

[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:39.540]
All right.

[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:44.360]
Last week you were talking about you read a little article about the Nutri-Sleet Problem.

[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.160]
They're about that?

[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:46.120]
Aspartane, yes.

[01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:47.580]
Yes, aspartane, correct.

[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.160]
I understand.

[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:49.760]
And I'm still very good, by the way.

[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.220]
I have to admit, I'm still drinking that crap.

[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:53.800]
I was on the line reading about it.

[01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:58.760]
There are endless amounts of websites pertaining to Aspartane and the horrors of it.

[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.240]
It's unbelievable that this product is on the market.

[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:02.560]
Yeah.

[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.540]
People are consuming it by the count.

[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.660]
I'm going to put alcohol in it and I'm drinking it by the count.

[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.100]
Georgia's drinking a diet Pepsi right now.

[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.420]
He's swirling it down as I speak.

[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.720]
Trying to swish out the taste of that crappy food fat boy brought up earlier.

[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:17.220]
What I read, basically, you drink it as soon as you drink it.

[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:17.380]
Yeah.

[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.980]
It breaks down into methanol.

[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:22.560]
And then that goes into your liver and starts poisoning your system.

[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:26.540]
Slow building, poisoning stays in your system.

[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:27.440]
What is wrong with me?

[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:32.760]
I got on here and I read that and I promised myself that those two diet Pepsi's I had that they didn't make sure were last I would ever have.

[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:36.100]
And then I go to the store and I'm buying diet right soda by the gallon.

[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:41.680]
And I got this solely bottled water, even the fizzy kind that I love from Italy, from Northern Italy,

[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.320]
that South套 comes with me for free.

[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.480]
And I'm still not drinking as much as I should.

[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.480]
I do drink it here at work, but I should be drinking it at home and no more soda.

[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:53.000]
It is so hard because now everyone's so conditioned to drinking diet soda.

[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.180]
You don't even want to drink water.

[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.160]
Let's go to the more.

[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:55.380]
Right.

[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:57.220]
You still use to the flavor of it.

[01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:01.880]
And of course when you're diabetic like I am, you can't drink the regular soda because it sure will send your blood sugar skyrocketing.

[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.540]
And of course, it will keep you fat as well and really bad for you too.

[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:05.300]
Exactly.

[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:08.600]
And why don't we do like to do in Europe and everybody drink a lot of bottled water?

[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:11.740]
They don't, the kids there will drink coax and stuff.

[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:15.120]
But most of the people that have a meal out and they drink bottled water.

[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:20.160]
Well, I drink water all the time, but I also like to have a mixed drink like a Roman Coke or something like that.

[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.680]
And you know, they say the only good thing about this diet code is that you have it without coax.

[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:25.520]
What just happened to this guy?

[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:26.720]
What's happening to our phone system?

[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:27.920]
Okay, call me back pal.

[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:28.760]
Call me back.

[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:29.480]
It's a great conversation.

[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:30.420]
But did you hear that?

[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.280]
It sounded like somebody was dealing with our phone right there.

[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:33.300]
Didn't it?

[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:34.880]
And like in the other room or somewhere in here?

[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.980]
Go look in the other room and see if some asshole is in there.

[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:40.160]
See, this is another thing about this whole thing with this crappy phone system.

[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.680]
I really don't know if these people are all actually dropping off.

[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.420]
If they're getting chopped off, God only knows what's going on.

[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:49.460]
One day we had some puttwacker that I think was Dan La Bastard from the Harold sitting in there.

[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:50.460]
There's nobody in there.

[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.900]
No, it's probably our friends at Bell Soff again who keep screwing with these guy named phone lines and chopping people off.

[01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:56.940]
You're not, we're on to you.

[01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:01.400]
Okay, my good friend, Larry, a mission said he's got a list of about half a dozen people are going to get asked by the end of this month.

[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.720]
He's going to ask you to say goodbye.

[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:04.900]
You're not fooling anybody.

[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:06.960]
Okay, screwing around with our livelihood here.

[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:10.140]
Not that we really care that much, but five six.

[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:12.160]
Seven, but that was a good call or the area at a good point.

[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:14.980]
Something important, which I did bring up that day by the way one day last week.

[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.200]
Was there any response about that?

[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:16.640]
No.

[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:17.700]
Better late than ever.

[01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:20.480]
And I'm glad he reminded me because I've got to stop drinking at craft.

[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:21.980]
Stop drinking at craft.

[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:23.540]
God dammit.

[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:32.040]
And just like yesterday, I was at the track last night and get there earlier.

[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.720]
Of course, it's always because I love the punishment.

[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.380]
And David Horrish was there last night.

[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:37.960]
I said, stay the hell away from me and he did.

[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:38.520]
Thank God.

[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.180]
Don't come anywhere near me, idiot.

[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.640]
So I'm flipping the channels on my little TV there in our box.

[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:48.460]
And all of a sudden, come across Channel 7 News, which I only channel served to I promise.

[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.320]
Got my legs crossed.

[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:51.500]
And they got a thing I don't know about.

[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.200]
If you're diabetic, a vegetarian diet can really be great.

[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:55.920]
And you might be able to stop all your medication.

[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:56.740]
And that's it.

[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.300]
Where is the rest of the story?

[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:01.760]
Where is Paul Harvey when we need him with the rest of the freaking God damn story?

[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:02.760]
That's what I would like to know.

[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.900]
Where is the rest of this thinking story?

[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:06.820]
And that was it.

[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.980]
So maybe I'll become a vegetarian, huh?

[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.220]
It takes a lot of bottled water.

[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:12.540]
Boy, that sounds boring, you know.

[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:14.900]
Does it?

[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.100]
The bottled water part I love.

[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.080]
I love bottled water.

[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:20.200]
Frizante that is.

[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:20.680]
Cungas.

[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:22.640]
I love my f***ing gas.

[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:23.060]
What?

[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.380]
When I wait, what is funny about that?

[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:26.840]
Frizante.

[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:28.640]
It just sounds funny.

[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:29.820]
Because of the talent.

[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:30.540]
Cungas.

[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:34.020]
When you go in a trot to read, they ask you, you know, a Cungas.

[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:35.300]
And you say, see or no.

[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:36.020]
See or no.

[01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:39.540]
Or you say, see this and they laugh.

[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.420]
Okay, I was in the car about a half an hour, but listening to you.

[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:46.140]
First of all, Nick Carter has more talent than his white coat than you will ever have.

[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.340]
And he's not a pineapple that you stupid fat baguette.

[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:50.680]
Frizante.

[01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:52.660]
Frizante.

[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:53.660]
Frizante.

[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:53.720]
Frizante.

[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.040]
Frizante.

[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.680]
Oops, just have to be watching VH1.

[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.900]
God, I just pulled a crisp baker.

[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:57.460]
I do like that.

[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:57.700]
Frizante.

[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.100]
Oh, I didn't do it for half an hour.

[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:00.220]
Frizante.

[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:01.560]

[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:02.300]
Frizante.

[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.260]
Yeah, there's the Nick Carter bitch.

[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.160]
And do we get an apology from Maria today?

[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:07.460]
No.

[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:08.160]
No, she don't care.

[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:09.860]
She doesn't just call up here and, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:14.120]
Like that kind of call yesterday and try to get this Beth Friedman abroad, confused and mixed

[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:15.940]
it with those two teachers with their swing clubs, you know.

[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:20.260]
Did he call him apologize and correct the error of the erroneous information that he tried to propagate

[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.380]
and use this radio show as his vehicle yesterday?

[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.320]
Did he apologize?

[01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:23.720]
No.

[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:23.960]
No.

[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.760]
And don't tell me they're not listening because they're hanging on it right now.

[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:28.400]
Believe you me.

[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.280]
They're squeezing themselves just from the publicity.

[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:34.780]
How come did you see how small this story is that Casino San, cut out of the paper?

[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.820]
Oh, this was on TV.

[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:38.020]
I've mentioned this the other day.

[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:42.500]
But nevertheless, instead of being on the front page, plastered on there like the Sun sent

[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:46.740]
over this teacher, this 40-year-old Beth Friedman, that was just trying to try to show the kids a good time, you know.

[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:47.360]
Right.

[01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:56.260]
A Hollywood priest is being sued by an anonymous plaintiff who claims the priest made sexual advances toward him dozens of times and mailed nude photos of himself.

[01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:04.460]
The suit by a plaintiff identified only as John Doe was filed last Wednesday in Broward Circuit Court against Reverend Joseph Sinesee of Saint Mary's Cat-Leaked Church.

[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.560]
Sinesee denied the allegations, of course.

[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:11.540]
The plaintiff's attorney, Russell Adler, said his client wanted to remain anonymous because he was ashamed by the experience.

[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.820]
And they showed the photos on that new story on TV.

[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:20.000]
So it's kind of hard to deny the experience when a guy's got the naked photos right there, but nevertheless, it'll all come out in the wash.

[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.700]
That's what the Pope always says.

[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.180]
It'll come out in the wash, all those things.

[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:29.060]
But anyway, how come there's that little tiny blurb in the paper there, but this school see where real big on the schools now?

[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:29.840]
Let's have a witch hunt.

[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:32.900]
Let's try to, you know, smear all the teachers with a big broad brush.

[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:36.240]
They're all perverts. They're all evil. They're all bad people. They're all my little senior children.

[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:40.260]
And for the kind of money we're paying them, who can trust them for five bucks an hour?

[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:45.620]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:54.520]
Give it a rest, pineapple head.

[01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:57.980]
Here's a lady in Miami. Hello.

[01:07:58.840 --> 01:07:59.040]
Hello.

[01:07:59.320 --> 01:07:59.800]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:07.920]
Yeah, I am so upset about the response about this teacher and how she's getting off with...

[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:08.820]
There is no anger.

[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:11.200]
There is no anger. I'm a teacher myself.

[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:11.600]
Right.

[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:21.760]
I just cannot believe that if this was a little girl, a 14-year-old girl, and then here's this 40-year-old man, you know, having sex with that...

[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.820]
They would already have him hung from a tree all the way.

[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:29.840]
We're getting all this bad rap for teachers, but you know what? There are a lot of bad teachers out there.

[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.940]
Sure, just like your bad cops, bad doctors, bad radio people, bad TV people.

[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:36.040]
We're dealing directly with children.

[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:36.380]
Right.

[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.880]
And they've got to do something about the way the higher teachers, the way they look at teachers.

[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.700]
I mean, she's... this lady had a law degree.

[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:44.280]
Right.

[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:45.240]
You know what she was doing?

[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:47.380]
You know, and it's just that.

[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:52.480]
I can't understand all these men that call up and say, oh, well, because it was a boy. He was coming of age.

[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:54.660]
He knew... you know, he got what he wanted.

[01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:58.620]
But if it would have been somebody's 14-year-old daughter out there, he'd have his shotgun out.

[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:01.200]
He'd be chasing the guy down right now as we speak.

[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:04.580]
Exactly. I just cannot believe the response of this guy.

[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:07.920]
How do you think I think of him? I mean, I saw the thing on the news yesterday.

[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:11.600]
And I remember that one call that we had on the show yesterday where the guy was totally wrong,

[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:14.820]
trying to hook this up and play in the teachers in that swing club, there was no connection.

[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:18.760]
But I remember that, and I see the story, and I watch it on the news again this morning to get updated on it.

[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:21.460]
I come here in a year and it's like, it's like nobody cares.

[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:22.500]
Oh, they're laughing again.

[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.740]
It's like a big joke, yeah.

[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.420]
It's a big joke.

[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:27.940]
Everybody thinks that, you know, we're real great if their teacher would have screwed them, you know?

[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:29.180]
No, I'm not quite.

[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:33.960]
Being a teacher, dealing with kids at 14-year-old age.

[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:36.620]
I mean, that's sick. It's crazy.

[01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:37.100]
It's unbelievable.

[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:37.880]

[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:42.180]
And providing them with acid and with coke and then buying a car.

[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:43.920]
Yeah, that's fine. Putting it aside, that's the second thing.

[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.460]
You know, I mean, just a sixth part of it, and then the drugs on top of that.

[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:50.040]
That's crazy. That's crazy.

[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:55.640]
I just don't understand the response we're getting from men and women who are giggling about this and saying, oh,

[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.200]
well, now you know why it goes on because nobody cares.

[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.420]
This is like the thing I've been screaming about about the priest for years and years.

[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:04.480]
I mean, it's not my imagination or making it up for stories.

[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:08.300]
These stories are in the papers every goddamn day and nobody cares about that.

[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:10.820]
And they keep going there and giving them their money. They don't care.

[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.000]
It's behind closed doors. They don't care.

[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:14.400]
They don't care.

[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:19.580]
Well, you sure, they sure seem to care when the teachers were doing it beyond closed doors at the swing club up there in the...

[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:21.840]
I think that was wrong, I don't.

[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:24.180]
I think it was wrong because they got arrested for something.

[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.420]
I think any kind of arrest, you should...

[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:29.000]
They say, well, they don't have to be wrong.

[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.220]
They are role models and they got arrested the same way if they would have gotten arrested for DUI.

[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:37.640]
No, no, no, that's ridiculous. DUI is endangering somebody else's life.

[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:40.400]
How can you make a comparison of consenting a dog having...

[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:40.800]
It's an arrest.

[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:41.580]
You're...

[01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:42.440]
Yeah, but...

[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.940]
So in other words, you're justifying the pleasure police, the sex police now.

[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:51.480]
So in other words, if somebody busts you for anything, if they came into your house and arrested you because you were...

[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:52.200]
I wouldn't have known that house.

[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:52.880]
What is it?

[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:53.760]
That wasn't...

[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.700]
You didn't let me finish this dude, aren't letting me speak.

[01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:02.280]
If they came into your house and you were breaking the Florida Sodomy Statute by having oral sex with your husband,

[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:06.080]
which is against the law, I don't know if you know what it is not, would you think that...

[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.420]
Well, you should be disqualified from teaching because you were arrested.

[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:10.360]
Yeah, that's tough.

[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.380]
I just don't think it's...

[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:12.900]
That tough?

[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:18.600]
So in other words, you think that nobody has the right to privacy, your sex life, if you're a teacher, or your public figure,

[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:19.600]
you should be open to everybody?

[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:20.860]
No.

[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:22.440]
So then what are you saying?

[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:23.480]
I'm just saying, I don't...

[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.100]
I mean, that's...

[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:24.320]
That's tough.

[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:25.660]
That's...

[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:27.260]
I just don't think that was right.

[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.460]
I don't think it's something that they have the right to be honest with.

[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:34.900]
Because you don't go there and you don't want to participate, you're making judgments about them.

[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:35.880]
No, I don't.

[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:36.640]
It's not here.

[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.860]
It's not anybody's business.

[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:38.820]
I think it's...

[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:39.720]
It's not anybody...

[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.080]
No, the sex lives are teachers.

[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:44.560]
Do you want to go to their class and tell your kids about your sex life?

[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:45.220]
Nope.

[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:46.880]
No, I don't.

[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:47.200]
Thank you.

[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:49.040]
Oh.

[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:52.140]
Very simple.

[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:55.760]
Okay, when she was on the other foot, when you pointed a finger at somebody else, they're bad.

[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:56.360]
They're evil.

[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:56.860]
It's wrong.

[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:57.500]
It's wrong.

[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:58.860]
Yadi, yadi, yadi.

[01:11:59.100 --> 01:11:59.140]
Yeah.

[01:11:59.140 --> 01:11:59.580]
But you don't want to...

[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:00.080]
Yes, dirty.

[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:00.980]
They're so dirty.

[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:07.800]
There is absolutely no reason in the world why students should know anything about their teacher's sex life,

[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:11.100]
much less their private lives, who they're married to, if they're married.

[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.020]
And it's got nothing to do with anything.

[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:14.040]
They're there to teach.

[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:15.460]
The kids are there to learn.

[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:15.900]
Period.

[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:17.340]
Period.

[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:22.760]
And this role model, BullCraft, that's a bunch of crap.

[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:25.260]
The parents, yours the ones that are supposed to be the role models.

[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:27.260]
Not the athletes, not the teachers.

[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:31.140]
Not all these other goddamn people that you keep laying every day, your own responsibilities off on.

[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:31.900]
The parents.

[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:33.700]
They should be the role models for the kids.

[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:36.540]
God.

[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.520]
But anyway, have a nice day, sweetheart.

[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:40.980]
How young is too young?

[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.100]
You can punch me, Zika Mindergroy!

[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.160]
Rift the hair off his chest and skill he snores!

[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:46.660]
Hello.

[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:49.940]
I'm Bernie Coffell, and I'm barely alive.

[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:52.640]
But I don't snore and here's why.

[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:57.080]
When we go to sleep, my wife always carries her anti-snore gun.

[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.280]
Not only is it easy for her to use, but it's very effective too.

[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.660]
And here's why.

[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:08.660]
Just one quick pull of the trigger and you'll sleep snore free all night long.

[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:13.920]
If you have a loved one that snores, use the anti-snore gun.

[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:16.420]
Just with the NRA order.

[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:21.680]
To order yours, have played a confetti in called the NRA at 1-800-American way.

[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.820]
That's the American f**king way.

[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:24.400]
Amen, sweetheart.

[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:29.980]
11-43-5-60-WQM, this teacher, she was going along okay until she started pointing fingers at everybody else.

[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:31.440]
They so dirty, okay?

[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:35.900]
She doesn't want her kids to know anything about her, you know, in her classes, not about her sex life,

[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.700]
because that's private, but other people, well, that's bad.

[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.220]
Even in a private club.

[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:43.320]
Even inside a place, behind closed doors.

[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:45.340]
Here's a lady in Hylia. Hello.

[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:46.420]
Hello, Neil.

[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.200]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:49.640]
Hi, I'm a hoolie from Hylia.

[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.140]
All right.

[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:51.660]
I want to just one time.

[01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:52.940]
I'm getting the hell out of here.

[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:54.640]
I'm blowing this taco stand.

[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.060]
Really? Where are you going?

[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:56.800]
In Indiana.

[01:13:57.380 --> 01:13:57.620]
Well.

[01:13:58.280 --> 01:13:58.640]
Yeah.

[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:00.240]
Nothing's perfect.

[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:05.240]
Yeah, I'll tell you though, I'd rather face an army of crazy red necks with guns.

[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:09.860]
And then, you know, all these professional Cubans and just crazy people running around here.

[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.560]
Can't thank for themselves.

[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:12.500]
Right, exactly.

[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:13.060]
Yeah.

[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:19.200]
And I don't know if anybody just brought this up, but there's a case, maybe, I guess, two or three years ago,

[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:22.280]
about that teacher in Washington State, Mary Kay, for no reason.

[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:23.260]
Right. I mentioned that, you know.

[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:27.640]
Yeah, I mean, the one every time they would let her out on parole, she would be dealing him again.

[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.880]
She just can't stop.

[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.320]
She's had two children, but that's the only way.

[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:31.660]
Right.

[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:34.020]
It's a polling.

[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:35.020]
That's America for you.

[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:35.640]

[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:42.220]
And I mean, I'll tell you one of your colleagues before I mentioned something about everybody being

[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:43.300]
episodic.

[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:44.780]
It's in the school system, too.

[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:48.140]
I'm a recent high school graduate, you know, hence why I'm moving.

[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.460]
And it's just, I don't know.

[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:57.880]
So schools are full of number one teachers who don't care who just, you know, are just there to draw a paycheck.

[01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:01.240]
Kids who don't care, they don't care about themselves.

[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:08.820]
You know, they don't care about their own, you know, lives and their parents, you know, either can't be on top of them or don't want to.

[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.280]
They don't, you know, their parents don't give a question.

[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.600]
Now, I guess the teachers want to be on top of them is what it sounds like.

[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.300]
Okay, we're listening. Good luck. I'll see you in Kokomo.

[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:15.740]
Thanks.

[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:16.300]
See you.

[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:16.480]
See you.

[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:17.140]
I'm Tara Holt.

[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:20.220]
Be sure and tell my people to call me a record club.

[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:23.560]
By the way, I want to cancel and a video thing, too, because I'm too lazy to call them.

[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.400]
Here's Tamara. Hello.

[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:27.080]
Hey, Neil.

[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:27.660]
Yes, sir.

[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:28.400]
How are you today?

[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:28.640]
Great.

[01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:30.800]
Okay, a couple of things.

[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:36.040]
First of all, you know, this thing with the teachers at the swing club.

[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:44.080]
I think one of the saddest things that's come out is that, you know, in having these board meetings, one of the teachers,

[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.000]
at least that I heard of on the news, is apologize.

[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:47.820]
Yeah, it's a great word.

[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:50.160]
And swearing that you'll never do it again.

[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.940]
And I think that's really sad.

[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:52.920]
Does he really say that?

[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:54.000]
City made a mistake.

[01:15:54.520 --> 01:16:00.000]
But see, yesterday you were all over a guy for saying, you know, that's a questionable behavior.

[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.460]
You were all over him.

[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.800]
But here you have the teacher questioning his own behavior.

[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:07.200]
No, he's not questioning his own behavior.

[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:08.740]
He's trying to cover his ass.

[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:10.380]
He's not questioning his behavior.

[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.240]
No, he's trying to say a whole lot of it.

[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:13.240]

[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:13.720]
And a mistake.

[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.020]
Isn't that what everybody always says?

[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:16.060]
Usually the religious nuts.

[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:18.500]
Oh, I made a mistake and I want to be forgiven and praise Jesus.

[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:19.620]
And now we go on with life.

[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:20.900]
That's basically what he's trying to do.

[01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:21.660]
What's the problem with that?

[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:25.460]
Well, wouldn't it be better if he took a stand and said it's none of your business or life?

[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.140]
Yeah, I'm not defending his comment.

[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:28.120]
Of course it would be.

[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:29.440]
You're absolutely right.

[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:32.320]
I'm appalled by all of a sudden turnaround.

[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.600]
Oh, I made a bad mistake and it was there in judgment.

[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:37.520]
And see, this is the problem, like I told you the other day.

[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:42.640]
There is no constituency for any kind of adult establishments because we live in a society

[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:47.500]
where the human body is bad, sex is evil, and all of these horrible things.

[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:50.320]
Nobody is supposed to admit to, even though most people, you know, either,

[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.940]
if they don't go, that they would like to.

[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:54.360]
But so, you know, lots of comes out in public.

[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.220]
You have to, you know, renounce your sins.

[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:04.220]
One other thing with the thing in Mississippi, with the Jewish star, the star of David.

[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:04.760]
Yeah.

[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:11.880]
I mean, that's absurd because if you had, if you wore the rave or flag in Mississippi,

[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:15.600]
I'm sure they'd patch on the back for what we're wearing.

[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:18.360]
We're a great point, average up about half a point, at least.

[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.140]
Exactly.

[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:20.440]
Two about a point five.

[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.880]
You know, this last call just brought up the teacher in Washington.

[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:30.480]
You can't compare the two between this lady now who is on the front page of the Sunday.

[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:31.300]
How do you know?

[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.660]
How much do we know about the woman on the front page?

[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:39.580]
Well, I mean, let's just say that everything, let's just say that the drug part is true.

[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:40.060]
Yeah.

[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.260]
I think that's a big difference.

[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:49.400]
The sad thing with the woman in Washington, she has kids with this boy, you know.

[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.960]
And I mean, they look like they were in love.

[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.360]
She can't see her kids.

[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.460]
That's, I mean, that's wrong.

[01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:56.460]
Yeah.

[01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:58.500]
I mean, I mean, it was hard.

[01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:59.380]
I would agree with you.

[01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:03.440]
I mean, first of all, that was only one kid that she was involved with, and evidently they were in love,

[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:06.380]
which is, you know, our society frowns on that to say the least.

[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:09.380]
But in this particular case, evidently, if the allegations are true,

[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:15.600]
this one was involved in a whole bunch of students underage, and was even living with a couple of men or condominium,

[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:19.520]
and was providing drugs and buying a kid a car and doing all sorts of other unacceptable things.

[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:19.800]
Right.

[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:20.980]
No, you're right. There is no comparison.

[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:25.340]
But regardless of what this woman did in Washington, she should be able to see her kids.

[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:26.980]
That's disgusting.

[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:27.580]
Yeah.

[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:33.860]
I mean, this kid, you know, is going to grow up without a mother and later on down the road, you know.

[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:35.320]
I mean, that kid is going to be screwed up.

[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:37.660]
Maybe she can go on guiding lights, she'll tell him it's Ross' kid.

[01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:38.300]
Have a great day.

[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:38.600]
All right.

[01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:43.480]
Okay. 5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.920]
A little bit of a flurry here right now.

[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.560]
Not too much. A little bit of excitement.

[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:48.480]
Don't want to go overboard here.

[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:52.720]
We want to pretend that we actually have some interest in these things because obviously we don't.

[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.080]
Which is good because it's nice to live in La La Land, you know.

[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.820]
Just kind of sit back and put your feet up on the desk.

[01:18:58.920 --> 01:18:59.260]
Yeah.

[01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:03.160]
Put up a bit of mixed doggy and just to flip off your boss.

[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:04.660]
Tell me it's a jackass.

[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:06.960]
Here's the four-later day.

[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:07.160]
Hello.

[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:12.880]
23 minutes and 30 seconds later.

[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:17.720]
And just at that magical moment when he's just about scored, scored to, uh, exploded out.

[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:18.840]
He's gone.

[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:19.700]
It's gone.

[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:23.900]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T line.

[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:25.160]
Here's a mobile and Palm Beach Gardens.

[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:25.480]
Hello.

[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:29.020]
Mobile and Palm Beach Gardens.

[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:30.320]
Neil, how you doing?

[01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:30.800]
Yes, sir.

[01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:32.540]
I just wanted to call to make a point.

[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:37.060]
I had sex with a teacher when I was in the ninth grade.

[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.820]
And about, what, 15?

[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.080]
Yeah, 15 years old.

[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:45.600]
And I considered myself very lucky at the time.

[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:46.840]
It didn't mess me up.

[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.380]
It was a wonderful experience.

[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.820]
It was certainly a man of men out of me.

[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:50.620]
And how old was he?

[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:51.460]
I mean, how old was he?

[01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:52.880]
He was in the late 30s.

[01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:53.080]
Yeah.

[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.700]
You know, we would need places after school and things like that.

[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.520]
You know, we've managed to keep it how sharp she knows where we found out.

[01:19:59.740 --> 01:19:59.900]
Yeah.

[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.600]
And I have no idea if she was with other people or not.

[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:07.300]
But, you know, in my opinion, this woman, you know, shirts and unethical thing,

[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:10.660]
as far as the drugs and alcohol concerned, to me, that's much worse.

[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:11.400]
Yeah.

[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:14.820]
In having sex with consensual sex with someone, because like you were saying before,

[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:20.600]
the society looks so far down on sex with violence and drugs and everything is, you know, a different story.

[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:22.500]
Well, yeah, as far as her concern.

[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:27.600]
And to start an American society, at least, professes to believe that if you're under the legal age,

[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.800]
meaning under 18, that you have no business having sexualizations with anybody.

[01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:32.800]
To me, that's absurd.

[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:33.840]
Everybody's having sex.

[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:34.560]
Wait, pardon me.

[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:37.180]
Of course they are, but I mean, that's what we say for public consumption.

[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:40.080]
You know, it's an understandable field of degree, you know.

[01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:43.940]
But when I was in school, this happened, and it didn't mess me up at all.

[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:45.540]
And she never forced me to do anything at any cost.

[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:47.480]
Of course, I was all forward at the time.

[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:50.620]
And I've certainly caught me a lot and sort of speak.

[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:55.600]
And the main thing is, if she was caught just having consensual sex with individuals,

[01:20:55.600 --> 01:21:00.300]
in my opinion, the most she should be is maybe fired, but as far as prison time, she's not even right to society.

[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:01.380]
But what about their staying?

[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:02.600]
What about the violence in the action?

[01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:05.640]
Yeah, that, like I said, those things definitely, that's way out of line.

[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:07.300]
But giving drugs to a child is one thing.

[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:11.640]
But all that was was set, I think, someone that's caught having sex with a student,

[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:15.240]
it's more of an ethical violation of my opinion than a criminal violation.

[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.480]
Drugs, of course, is a different story, you know.

[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.480]
Let me ask you this.

[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:25.260]
If a guy who's like 19, forget about 40 like this teacher is, if a guy who's 19 has sex with a 14-year-old girl,

[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:27.240]
that statutory rape, he's going to jail.

[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:32.380]
Yeah, that's where, I guess we all look at differently when it's the other way around when it's a little boy and a...

[01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:33.180]
Exactly.

[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:35.640]
But in that case, in this case, the boy...

[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:39.760]
The boy's got a 15-year-old and 14-year-old boy, they're supposed to be horny and they're supposed to have sex.

[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:44.540]
But God forbid the male teacher would have sex with a 14-year-old daughter, you're going to blow his brains out.

[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.200]
And you know it.

[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.680]
Yeah, but it was fun, you know.

[01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:49.400]
It was fun.

[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:49.980]
Okay, pal.

[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:50.600]
Have a good day.

[01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:51.100]
Bottoms up.

[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.420]
See, that brings to mind one question.

[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:54.780]
How young is two young?

[01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:55.420]
See, American society...

[01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:00.760]
I mean, I don't want to get into this, okay, because it's a very touchy, delicate thing in this country.

[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:05.300]
Most other countries you'll find, legal age for consenting sex, is 14, 15, 16.

[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:06.460]
I think Canada is 14.

[01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:09.120]
And most countries in Europe, it's 15 or 16.

[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.480]
I don't know of any country in Europe where it's over 16.

[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:16.200]
But in America, of course, it's 18.

[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.600]
So you have, on the one hand, the laws.

[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:21.420]
And secondly, you have a society, like I said, that professors to believe, even though there are...

[01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:26.770]
There are 10 of you out there who really believe that people under the age of 18 aren't having sex or shouldn't have sex.

[01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:28.130]
Nobody really believes that.

[01:22:28.270 --> 01:22:32.430]
But we say all of these things for public consumption because we're a bunch of phonies and hypocrites.

[01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:33.950]
That's the American F in a way.

[01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:36.670]
And he raises a good point.

[01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:41.130]
If you know, she only had sex with a kid, would there be people out under a risk breakdown now, especially with a boy?

[01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:42.110]
Probably not.

[01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:43.130]
Because I don't see any...

[01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:45.870]
Even with the drugs, I don't see anybody really cares to be honest with him.

[01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:46.950]
Lucky bastard.

[01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:49.030]
No, not a lucky bastard. Not with the drugs.

[01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:50.790]
Sorry, that's why I draw the...

[01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:51.470]
Draw the line with the other guy.

[01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:52.170]
And get the same...

[01:22:52.170 --> 01:22:52.970]
Oh, the guy that called.

[01:22:53.130 --> 01:22:53.190]
Yeah.

[01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:53.770]
That's right.

[01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:54.890]
It's hard to like you at a good time.

[01:22:55.810 --> 01:22:57.690]
Oh my God, how could you say these things?

[01:22:58.930 --> 01:23:00.210]
I know, sex is very bad.

[01:23:00.710 --> 01:23:01.870]
Here's a lady in Miami. Hello.

[01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:03.570]
Hi, Mia. How you doing today?

[01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.990]
Okay.

[01:23:04.410 --> 01:23:05.270]
I have a comment.

[01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:07.510]
What you're saying is true about, you know, the...

[01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:09.450]
The boy having sex with the older teacher.

[01:23:09.630 --> 01:23:10.030]
That's true.

[01:23:10.170 --> 01:23:12.950]
Why is this so different between a girl having sex with the older...

[01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:16.930]
You know, when they're young and having sex with the older...

[01:23:16.930 --> 01:23:17.350]
Right.

[01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:18.530]
And then the comment is like...

[01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:18.890]
Teacher.

[01:23:19.530 --> 01:23:21.070]
Right. You know...

[01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.510]
I can't...

[01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:22.050]
It doesn't matter.

[01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:23.450]
I got a little five-year-old.

[01:23:23.530 --> 01:23:24.770]
I got a little eight-month-old baby.

[01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:25.510]
I don't play that.

[01:23:25.650 --> 01:23:25.910]
I don't care.

[01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.690]
Teacher, no teacher.

[01:23:26.890 --> 01:23:27.730]
I'll still blow you head off.

[01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:29.070]
I have another comment.

[01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:30.090]
So, I would you don't discriminate?

[01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.730]
Right.

[01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:33.910]
I have another comment that teaches a call a couple of minutes ago

[01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:35.210]
about those...

[01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:38.290]
Alright.

[01:23:38.690 --> 01:23:39.650]
We had the jackpot.

[01:23:42.090 --> 01:23:42.450]
Alright.

[01:23:44.010 --> 01:23:46.370]
She said, if that other teacher had called me for,

[01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:48.250]
so, effing perfect, then, you know,

[01:23:48.330 --> 01:23:50.250]
let her offer high horse, etc. and so on.

[01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:51.310]
I've gone to sweetheart.

[01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:53.910]
But just remember, it's the US of A.

[01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:57.630]
You can't say the F word on a year because the government gets real nervous about that.

[01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:58.970]
If you do it, they get nervous.

[01:23:59.170 --> 01:24:01.750]
But if you even say it, they also start sweating a little bit.

[01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:04.990]
Because they start conjuring up images of what you're talking about.

[01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:10.930]
5-670560, 0560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:12.690]
Here's Miami.

[01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:13.050]
Hello.

[01:24:14.010 --> 01:24:14.470]
Hello.

[01:24:14.770 --> 01:24:15.110]
Yes, sir.

[01:24:15.490 --> 01:24:16.090]
How are you doing, Neil?

[01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.550]
Okay.

[01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:18.430]
I got a little story to share with you.

[01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:19.870]
Mine involved alcohol, though.

[01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:21.510]
It was, um, grandnight.

[01:24:21.690 --> 01:24:22.770]
I was 17 years old.

[01:24:23.170 --> 01:24:24.770]
Um, my teacher was...

[01:24:24.770 --> 01:24:27.330]
She must have been about 25, 26.

[01:24:28.210 --> 01:24:30.130]
We all snuck in alcohol, orange juice,

[01:24:30.130 --> 01:24:30.930]
and all that to the bus.

[01:24:31.170 --> 01:24:32.170]
Found the way to Disney World.

[01:24:32.770 --> 01:24:33.950]
We all got a little happy.

[01:24:34.290 --> 01:24:35.870]
We got a little touchy touchy.

[01:24:36.570 --> 01:24:38.150]
And as soon as we got off the bus,

[01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:39.390]
and we just did it.

[01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:40.830]
I mean, but that was it.

[01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:43.450]
As soon as you got off the bus, so, okay, I'm sure Mickey had a good time, too,

[01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:44.510]
because we all know about Mickey.

[01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:45.650]
Don't we know about Mickey?

[01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:46.530]
Yeah, we know.

[01:24:47.010 --> 01:24:47.650]
What's in it, uniform.

[01:24:48.110 --> 01:24:49.330]
I hate to break the news, George,

[01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:53.530]
but there's a chick that you get all psychotic about here on VH1 from the chin-up.

[01:24:53.710 --> 01:24:55.210]
I mean, I'll give her a 5.

[01:24:55.410 --> 01:24:57.150]
Maybe she does a chin-up.

[01:24:57.730 --> 01:24:58.870]
She's doing chin-ups, yeah.

[01:24:59.590 --> 01:25:00.390]
5.6.7.

[01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:02.130]
There's a couple of phone lines ringing out, too, by the way.

[01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:04.590]
I just thought I would mention that to try to get your push out of the screen,

[01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:05.690]
where it's embedded at the moment.

[01:25:07.890 --> 01:25:11.430]
Yeah, you see, girls, and how would Ricky Martin be big?

[01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:13.990]
And as much as I love their music, I don't like to backstreet boys,

[01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:15.170]
because they're hot looking, because they're not.

[01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:16.250]
But their music is great.

[01:25:16.490 --> 01:25:17.810]
But nevertheless, sitting on that aside,

[01:25:18.190 --> 01:25:19.210]
all these other boy groups.

[01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:22.970]
Why would they be bigger, unless the 10 and 12 and 13-year-old hormonal girls

[01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:24.950]
were all like, falling at the mouth over them?

[01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:26.810]
Like that, like the crazy girl I called yesterday,

[01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:29.110]
who's gotten the Cog and the Carter blow-up dial at home,

[01:25:29.370 --> 01:25:30.930]
which is the only way she's going to get close to him.

[01:25:31.210 --> 01:25:31.890]
Trust me, sweetheart.

[01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:34.510]
Oh, no, you don't understand.

[01:25:34.810 --> 01:25:35.790]
Girls are not that son.

[01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:36.590]
That's a boy thing.

[01:25:36.710 --> 01:25:37.790]
Boys are supposed to be horny.

[01:25:38.370 --> 01:25:39.090]
They're the pursuers.

[01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:40.110]
They're the aggressors.

[01:25:40.290 --> 01:25:42.810]
They're the ones that are like, you know, pumping everything that moves.

[01:25:43.970 --> 01:25:45.670]
But the young girls, they're supposed to be refined.

[01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:48.010]
They're not supposed to be interested in all of these things.

[01:25:50.130 --> 01:25:51.890]
That's why we have to go visit the family priest.

[01:25:52.450 --> 01:25:55.230]
Not for a discussion, just because he's interested, he might help you.

[01:25:55.930 --> 01:25:57.330]
Here's a North Miami fellow.

[01:25:57.650 --> 01:25:57.970]
Hello?

[01:25:58.290 --> 01:25:58.610]
Yes, sir.

[01:25:59.310 --> 01:26:00.610]
Here's a good question.

[01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:02.130]
On a teacher thing with the kid?

[01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:02.670]
Yes, sir.

[01:26:02.970 --> 01:26:04.430]
It's a kid murdered somebody.

[01:26:04.710 --> 01:26:05.210]
They have a hearing.

[01:26:05.310 --> 01:26:06.090]
They make them an adult.

[01:26:08.050 --> 01:26:08.930]
Yeah, that's a good point.

[01:26:10.210 --> 01:26:13.890]
You know, like, what would happen if this kid happened to kill a terrible thing to say?

[01:26:14.150 --> 01:26:14.950]
No, no, no, no.

[01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.710]
Somebody was killed today.

[01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:16.330]
It was very well.

[01:26:16.530 --> 01:26:16.630]
That's a good point.

[01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:18.530]
You're right, they had to tell you about it.

[01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:18.870]
It's right.

[01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:19.050]
It's right.

[01:26:19.050 --> 01:26:19.170]
It's right.

[01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:22.150]
It's right.

[01:26:22.150 --> 01:26:22.830]
They've passed up.

[01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:23.910]
That's a bad choice of words.

[01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:25.150]
Yeah.

[01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:27.470]
No, very good point.

[01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.990]
Thank you, sir.

[01:26:28.090 --> 01:26:28.550]
God bless you.

[01:26:28.630 --> 01:26:29.410]
I know what I thought of that.

[01:26:29.690 --> 01:26:33.250]
12-year-old boy with a 60-year-old girl, remember to put the hammer lock, the arresting thing.

[01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:36.930]
And of course, he just had to slam her down on 20 or 30 times to manage.

[01:26:36.970 --> 01:26:37.410]
He's dead.

[01:26:38.630 --> 01:26:39.970]
Good old with trying him as an adult.

[01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:40.670]
Murder.

[01:26:41.970 --> 01:26:45.210]
But a 14-year-old boy, you know, he has sex with a 40-year-old woman.

[01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:47.390]
And how come he can't be considered an adult?

[01:26:49.150 --> 01:26:49.310]
Huh?

[01:26:50.110 --> 01:26:50.630]
That's sex.

[01:26:50.630 --> 01:26:51.470]
Oh, that's right.

[01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:51.810]
It's sex.

[01:26:51.810 --> 01:26:52.630]
I forgot about that.

[01:26:52.810 --> 01:26:54.690]
And of course, it also brings back that question.

[01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:55.890]
How young is two young?

[01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:56.230]
Right.

[01:26:57.430 --> 01:27:00.230]
5-6705-60, 0.560 on a mobile one line.

[01:27:00.710 --> 01:27:02.510]
It's four minutes still new and here at QAM.

[01:27:02.810 --> 01:27:04.190]
12-035-60-WPM.

[01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.570]
Guess what?

[01:27:04.650 --> 01:27:05.890]
We hit the jackpot boys and girls.

[01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.810]
Oh, yeah.

[01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:08.470]
In the cruel cables.

[01:27:09.630 --> 01:27:10.830]
At 46-12, as you enrolled.

[01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:11.670]
Thanks, Jim Stoodley.

[01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:13.110]
You brought us lunch today and I'm great.

[01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:13.990]
What are you looking at?

[01:27:14.710 --> 01:27:16.370]
Man, this is an amazing Italian food.

[01:27:16.450 --> 01:27:16.810]
You want it, huh?

[01:27:17.690 --> 01:27:19.430]
They have got like real Italian food.

[01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:20.950]
This isn't like make-believe.

[01:27:21.190 --> 01:27:24.590]
And by the way, you said he's got some great Jeff Cohen stories, which I'm sure he does.

[01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:27.590]
But nevertheless, so now what kind of soup is this again?

[01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:28.590]
This is fantastic.

[01:27:28.930 --> 01:27:30.190]
This is just what the doctor ordered.

[01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:33.490]
A hot pepper best or something like.

[01:27:33.570 --> 01:27:33.770]
Mmm.

[01:27:34.110 --> 01:27:34.810]
God is just good.

[01:27:35.130 --> 01:27:36.730]
And real thin pizza, like they make it in Rome.

[01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:38.710]
Not the, well, I don't want to get started.

[01:27:38.710 --> 01:27:39.630]
You know, with the pizza people.

[01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:43.550]
But the real thin authentic way they make it in Italy, except for the thick seasoning,

[01:27:43.690 --> 01:27:44.770]
which most of us don't eat.

[01:27:45.610 --> 01:27:48.250]
5-6705-60, 0.560 on a mobile one line.

[01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.030]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[01:27:50.230 --> 01:27:50.370]
Hello.

[01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:53.770]
What is it?

[01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:54.710]
Hello.

[01:27:55.170 --> 01:27:55.790]
Yes, bad phone.

[01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.030]
Yes.

[01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:58.330]
I was just up.

[01:27:59.190 --> 01:28:00.030]
You have to wait back.

[01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:00.150]

[01:28:00.210 --> 01:28:01.350]
Your phone is unacceptable, pal.

[01:28:01.670 --> 01:28:02.230]
Sorry about that.

[01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.790]
Call me back.

[01:28:04.190 --> 01:28:05.590]
Bad phone problems today, man.

[01:28:05.730 --> 01:28:06.790]
Phone problems on the inside.

[01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:08.050]
Phone problems on the outside.

[01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:10.090]
The wonders of cell technology, man.

[01:28:10.410 --> 01:28:12.230]
It really is a long way to go.

[01:28:14.210 --> 01:28:17.630]
5-6705-60, 0.560 on our mobile one line.

[01:28:17.630 --> 01:28:18.790]
Let's try a mobile in Davy.

[01:28:18.850 --> 01:28:19.030]
Hello.

[01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.870]
Hello.

[01:28:20.150 --> 01:28:20.490]
Yes, sir.

[01:28:20.650 --> 01:28:21.430]
Neil, how are you doing?

[01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:21.890]
All right.

[01:28:22.770 --> 01:28:24.150]
Here's the issue that I have.

[01:28:24.630 --> 01:28:28.630]
I don't have anything against anybody having sex with anybody.

[01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:33.190]
As long as they're consenting adults, the probably thing prostitution should be legalized.

[01:28:33.230 --> 01:28:34.470]
Yeah, but what is an adult, though?

[01:28:34.530 --> 01:28:35.130]
That's the question.

[01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:36.090]
How young is too young?

[01:28:36.230 --> 01:28:36.590]
Exactly.

[01:28:36.970 --> 01:28:42.970]
And my question here is, if you're in your 30s or 40s, you're desired to have sex with a 14-year-old.

[01:28:43.130 --> 01:28:44.170]
There's got to be something wrong with you.

[01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:50.910]
Well, by American standards, I mean, I have no interest in having sex with 14-year-olds either or 15 or 16-year-olds.

[01:28:51.010 --> 01:28:55.630]
But if you're in your 30s or 40s, you're desired to have sex with 12 or 13-year-olds.

[01:28:55.710 --> 01:28:57.010]
No, now you got it down to 12.

[01:28:57.210 --> 01:29:06.350]
I mean, how far do we draw the line before people who are pedophiles or people enter little children and somebody who's in adolescence?

[01:29:06.930 --> 01:29:12.050]
Like I said, the legal age in most countries is like the median, I would say, like 15 or 16 for both boys and girls.

[01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:13.070]
I don't know if that's right.

[01:29:13.170 --> 01:29:14.190]
I mean, I think that's a little young.

[01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:16.670]
15-year-olds can be influenced by anything, anybody.

[01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:18.210]
I think maybe a little...

[01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:26.590]
Even now, you see, it's hard to make a determination because there are 15-year-olds who are like 12-year-olds and there are 15-year-old kids who are like 20-year-olds.

[01:29:26.810 --> 01:29:27.770]
So it's very hard.

[01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:29.810]
How can you determine maturity level in a kid?

[01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:32.130]
See, I think that the legal age should be 17.

[01:29:32.370 --> 01:29:34.430]
I mean, maybe I'm a little fashion, maybe I'm...

[01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:38.450]
But I think that that's not so revolutionary that it doesn't go so far under what it is now.

[01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:43.310]
I think for boys and girls, both straight and gay, 17 would be an age that maybe we could agree on.

[01:29:43.710 --> 01:29:45.170]
But 14 and 15-year-olds...

[01:29:45.170 --> 01:29:51.690]
You have to base your behavior on what society says, you know, and you can't be having sex with 14 and 15-year-olds.

[01:29:51.810 --> 01:29:54.050]
If society says, if you do, that we're going to throw you ass in jail.

[01:29:54.250 --> 01:29:59.650]
Right. Well, I thought we'd establish that 18-year-old was kind of the adult line here in this country.

[01:29:59.830 --> 01:30:03.970]
Yeah, but it's interesting that kids can go out and buy guns, but they can't, number one, have sex.

[01:30:04.270 --> 01:30:06.350]
And number two, they can't buy a pack of cigarettes or a bottle of beer.

[01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:10.570]
I just think that if you're in your 30s and 40s and you're desired to have sex with a 14-year-old,

[01:30:10.650 --> 01:30:12.770]
there's something wrong with you. It's not normal.

[01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:15.330]
And then should you be teaching our children?

[01:30:16.150 --> 01:30:18.150]
No, I would agree with you. I think that anyone...

[01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:19.190]
That's what you think you're doing.

[01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:24.530]
Any 40-year-old teacher that's having sex with 14 and 15-year-old kids automatically should have their ass fired immediately.

[01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:25.210]
No question.

[01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:26.890]
I don't know if they should be fired, but I think they should be fired.

[01:30:26.890 --> 01:30:30.870]
You don't think they should be fired? Then what then what should we do with them? Like give them a couple of months to cool out?

[01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:33.870]
Yeah, maybe they've got to have something mentally wrong with them.

[01:30:34.150 --> 01:30:34.370]
Yeah.

[01:30:34.370 --> 01:30:34.950]
They're sick.

[01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:39.850]
So then if they're sick, why would you want them teaching your children?

[01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:41.090]
No, you're right. I wouldn't.

[01:30:41.170 --> 01:30:45.610]
But I'm saying I'm in my 30s and you know, I'm going to drive by schools and I see these 14-year-olds who look like this.

[01:30:46.010 --> 01:30:46.930]
All right, but wait a minute.

[01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:52.510]
Okay, Brittany Spears, okay, she's 17. She could be 16. She could be 19. She could be anything, okay?

[01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:55.150]
Now Brittany Spears, everybody in her brother tells me,

[01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:59.210]
oh hey, we don't care whether she's legal or not. And I believe that they don't give a crap, okay?

[01:30:59.470 --> 01:31:01.130]
She's hot, she's whatever she is.

[01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:03.470]
And you're going to tell me that you would turn her down?

[01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:05.470]
No, but if it was your daughter, you'd feel differently.

[01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:09.110]
You know, I feel like Brittany and Peter and so on and so on, everybody else.

[01:31:09.490 --> 01:31:12.130]
Exactly. I think everybody just says that, but I think when it comes to...

[01:31:12.130 --> 01:31:16.390]
But why is it that if it was your 15-year-old son that was getting it out with a 30 or 40-year-old teacher,

[01:31:16.670 --> 01:31:18.770]
that maybe you might not be proud of, say, hey, nice going, Billy.

[01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:20.170]
No, no, I don't feel that way either.

[01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:24.410]
No, I'm 15-year-old boy was doing some 30-year-old girl. I'd have a problem with that.

[01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:27.350]
Yeah. And now with my son, the problem's with a 30-year-old.

[01:31:27.730 --> 01:31:30.450]
I get, I mean, you know, I'm 15-year-old. You still get horny.

[01:31:30.450 --> 01:31:34.550]
But where do you draw the line? If you... How about if she was 25 years old and your son is 15?

[01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:38.130]
I think that if she's still a teenager, she's 19 years old and my kids 15.

[01:31:38.610 --> 01:31:41.750]
You know, even I think there's something a lot with her, but I can understand.

[01:31:41.770 --> 01:31:46.090]
Oh, and now wait a minute, come on. If your kid is 15, he looks like maybe 17 or 18.

[01:31:46.370 --> 01:31:50.030]
And he's mature. And a girl is 19. You're going to tell me you think there was something wrong with her?

[01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:51.330]
No, I don't think there's any wrong with her.

[01:31:51.570 --> 01:31:52.450]
He just got her son in that.

[01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:55.810]
No, no, no, no. I mean, you raise it to 17. That's different.

[01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:57.830]
You got a 15-year-old who's seven.

[01:31:57.830 --> 01:32:02.270]
No, no, I said if you're 15-year-old's son, an accident looks like 17, which is possible.

[01:32:02.490 --> 01:32:06.030]
No, it's awesome, man. If you're a teenager and you want to have sex with another teenager,

[01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:07.770]
it's going to happen. I don't see a problem with that.

[01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:09.850]
But you know, 30s and 40s? I mean, come on.

[01:32:10.190 --> 01:32:12.630]
There's something wrong with you. That's my issue here.

[01:32:12.850 --> 01:32:14.970]
I want to go to a sex club and do what you want. That's fine.

[01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:15.830]
If you're in a adult, right?

[01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:20.110]
Exactly. I don't care. Well, who you have sex with and, you know, I don't care what sex it is.

[01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:24.870]
But when you're talking about, you know, you're an adult. 30, 40 years old like this woman was.

[01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.130]
Right.

[01:32:25.130 --> 01:32:30.170]
And you have a desire, just the fact that you desire to have sex with a 14-year-old kid.

[01:32:30.770 --> 01:32:33.770]
I don't know. I think there's an issue there. There's something wrong with when years.

[01:32:33.950 --> 01:32:35.650]
I agree with you. That's my only issue.

[01:32:35.690 --> 01:32:36.610]
Okay, pal. Have a nice day.

[01:32:36.710 --> 01:32:38.710]
Have a great day. Of course, maybe he was hot. Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:32:39.450 --> 01:32:42.310]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5. Just a joke, folks. It's just a little joke.

[01:32:42.630 --> 01:32:45.930]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, pound, 5, 6, 8 on the mobile one line.

[01:32:46.010 --> 01:32:49.890]
They get really uptight about all of this because it's America, man. It's dirty.

[01:32:50.630 --> 01:32:52.170]
How young is two youngs?

[01:33:13.530 --> 01:33:14.170]
Oh, hey.

[01:33:14.890 --> 01:33:15.610]
Oh, hey.

[01:33:15.610 --> 01:33:15.770]
Oh, hey.

[01:33:16.370 --> 01:33:16.870]
Oh, hey.

[01:33:17.150 --> 01:33:17.270]
Oh, hey.

[01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.270]

[01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.310]
Oh, hey.

[01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.310]

[01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.310]

[01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.310]

[01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.310]

[01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.310]

[01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.310]

[01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.310]

[01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.310]

[01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.530]
Oh, hey.

[01:33:17.690 --> 01:33:21.350]
Oh, hey.

[01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.550]
Oh, hey.

[01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:45.610]
Oh, hey.

[01:33:46.050 --> 01:33:48.050]
Oh, hey.

[01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:49.070]
Oh, hey.

[01:33:50.190 --> 01:33:50.810]
Oh, hey.

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.530]

[01:35:48.570 --> 01:35:49.970]
here's a lady in davie hello

[01:35:49.970 --> 01:35:51.010]
hello you know

[01:35:51.010 --> 01:35:55.330]
uh... parent as well as a teacher and i kind of keep flip flopping between

[01:35:55.330 --> 01:35:59.090]
listening to what's going on from both sides is getting teachers and parents

[01:35:59.090 --> 01:36:02.010]
and the thing i can't understand is with the parents

[01:36:02.010 --> 01:36:06.170]
uh... you know they're amazing they sit there and they talk about teachers but

[01:36:06.170 --> 01:36:07.010]
yet is a teacher

[01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:10.950]
some of the stories that these children tell me that go on in their homes

[01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:14.310]
they have a lot of nerve talking about teachers in a bad way

[01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:16.010]
you know for instance is it

[01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:20.470]
disgusting if our parents is uh... let's have a toilet and the child is able

[01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:22.130]
to walk in and out of the bathroom

[01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:26.910]
is that okay that's considered like in our right now my soup no less yet

[01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:31.270]
disgusting our right now exactly and on the other hand as the teacher

[01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:33.730]
she should she should still have acted

[01:36:33.730 --> 01:36:37.550]
in a professional manner but what those other two teachers did it later

[01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:41.010]
they should have been allowed to do what they want they're not doing it in front

[01:36:41.010 --> 01:36:41.650]
of a child

[01:36:41.650 --> 01:36:41.890]
yeah

[01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:46.130]
outcome there's not the big fear of you see this i'm sure you saw the story about

[01:36:46.130 --> 01:36:49.930]
this woman was now arrested for uh... helping to cover up the uh... the

[01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:52.970]
nephew was at the fifteen-year-old nephew that raped her five-year-old daughter

[01:36:52.970 --> 01:36:56.210]
and she pretended she was asleep and changed the story a hundred times this

[01:36:56.210 --> 01:36:59.370]
tranquilizer that tranquilizer yeah it was going on the very next room in the

[01:36:59.370 --> 01:37:02.790]
the little girl five-year-old girl was so beaten and bloody than the bruise

[01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:04.170]
because of such a violent attack

[01:37:04.170 --> 01:37:07.950]
and how come there's not a big thing about that well that kind of people we have

[01:37:07.950 --> 01:37:10.890]
making babies in this country absolutely nobody cares about it

[01:37:10.890 --> 01:37:14.130]
and as a teacher here the same thing going on from your students when they

[01:37:14.130 --> 01:37:16.110]
talk about go what goes on with their parents

[01:37:16.810 --> 01:37:20.450]
you know and that and if there is a chance going on which is a teacher i've seen

[01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:22.850]
plenty uh... let me tell you something

[01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:25.970]
it is amazing how many times the mother does know

[01:37:26.610 --> 01:37:27.190]
and they did

[01:37:27.770 --> 01:37:32.250]
studies at now more and more that the women the mothers do know what's going on

[01:37:32.250 --> 01:37:32.610]
and just

[01:37:32.610 --> 01:37:34.990]
turns you know a blind eye on it

[01:37:35.530 --> 01:37:37.910]
and and this goes on even with boyfriend

[01:37:38.690 --> 01:37:39.830]
uh... of you know

[01:37:40.510 --> 01:37:43.110]
you have a daughter in the house and the boyfriends coming in

[01:37:43.110 --> 01:37:44.390]
and a lot of times

[01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:45.050]
the girls

[01:37:45.690 --> 01:37:49.290]
you know bothered by these boys and they go and they tell their mother

[01:37:49.290 --> 01:37:50.490]
the mother will

[01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:52.190]
insurably

[01:37:52.190 --> 01:37:54.050]
side with the boyfriends really

[01:37:54.050 --> 01:37:57.210]
uh... yeah many times that maybe the mother's getting a little too on a side

[01:37:57.210 --> 01:37:58.250]
that could be

[01:37:58.250 --> 01:38:02.210]
but this is our six society that gets it's been on both sides of what do you think

[01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:04.170]
teachers should have sex with their students that's okay

[01:38:04.170 --> 01:38:06.350]
not no absolutely not

[01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.970]
i mean

[01:38:06.970 --> 01:38:10.950]
many most of us are in the profession because we love it was certainly not

[01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:12.730]
any further money we work real hard

[01:38:12.730 --> 01:38:15.370]
and we do lots of wonderful things with these children

[01:38:15.870 --> 01:38:17.130]
but unfortunately now

[01:38:17.130 --> 01:38:18.150]
with our wonderful

[01:38:18.750 --> 01:38:22.370]
our wonderful governor and you know increasing class size to the point where

[01:38:22.370 --> 01:38:24.210]
there's forty children in your class

[01:38:24.210 --> 01:38:25.110]
and you

[01:38:25.110 --> 01:38:26.510]
is that and parents

[01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:30.370]
who never come up to even see you and want to know what's going on in school

[01:38:30.370 --> 01:38:31.150]
that too busy

[01:38:31.150 --> 01:38:32.990]
uh... and then neglectful

[01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:36.010]
it's just a horrible situation on both sides

[01:38:36.010 --> 01:38:39.530]
so there's a lot of time that these children get to be on their own

[01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:41.690]
at parents don't know what's going on

[01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:45.750]
and if you do want to know i'll get a teacher that is unprofessional like

[01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:46.610]
this one

[01:38:46.610 --> 01:38:47.550]
this lady

[01:38:48.210 --> 01:38:49.710]
these things can happen

[01:38:49.710 --> 01:38:52.570]

uh... they knew what we've got you know he was written up there but you know

[01:39:01.070 --> 01:39:01.590]

[01:39:04.090 --> 01:39:05.610]
trying to act down you know

[01:39:05.610 --> 01:39:07.030]
because nobody cares right

[01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.910]
things so

[01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:10.030]

[01:39:25.730 --> 01:39:27.690]
hopefully this is a better phone line

[01:39:28.170 --> 01:39:28.650]
so

[01:39:29.170 --> 01:39:33.410]
yes but there are bad teachers just like their bad cops just like their bad

[01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:33.950]
doctors

[01:39:34.690 --> 01:39:37.970]
you know but little do we you know we always forget you know we forget about

[01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:39.970]
the teacher i think it was a year and a half ago

[01:39:39.970 --> 01:39:41.690]
and have sex with the kid

[01:39:42.330 --> 01:39:46.370]
and then uh... she got pregnant you know she was bad from the kids you got

[01:39:46.370 --> 01:39:48.090]
chance to have to with him again

[01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:49.490]
yeah we talked about that

[01:39:49.490 --> 01:39:52.830]
then you turn around and you two weeks ago in my any

[01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:57.210]
there's the high school coach or that that from the christian school

[01:39:57.790 --> 01:39:59.390]
and had sex with his student

[01:40:00.630 --> 01:40:02.910]
consenting sex she's fifteen years old

[01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:06.310]
and that story went away just like the story with the cops right

[01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:10.310]
and i'm going to one one two twice maybe that was the end of that story right

[01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:11.930]
absolutely and it was funny

[01:40:11.930 --> 01:40:15.470]
that you know the principal from that particular school

[01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:16.630]
it's on television

[01:40:16.630 --> 01:40:19.450]
and says well we know that double was at work

[01:40:19.450 --> 01:40:21.610]
oh there you go one of the outside no problem

[01:40:21.610 --> 01:40:24.490]
you know and so it's really funny that

[01:40:24.490 --> 01:40:25.250]
you know

[01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:30.530]
the media to do which story they want to hide out

[01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:34.170]
uh... the two teachers and the in the fifth club

[01:40:34.170 --> 01:40:38.370]
we're doing their own thing that story doesn't die because that's selling newspapers

[01:40:38.370 --> 01:40:39.090]
for them

[01:40:39.090 --> 01:40:42.970]
these other stories are selling newspapers for them so they don't worry about

[01:40:42.970 --> 01:40:46.830]
they don't probe into them like they should be

[01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:50.550]
you know other things are more important ricky martin's more important

[01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:52.130]
now you're talking now you get to the matter

[01:40:52.130 --> 01:40:55.690]
you know to any martin is more important for the market martin

[01:40:55.690 --> 01:40:57.990]
all of the martin for any martin

[01:40:57.990 --> 01:41:01.910]
anything that sell a newspaper is what the media will push

[01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:05.910]
and you know like you always talk to you too lame duck newspapers that we have

[01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:08.290]
down here the worst you know they

[01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:10.650]
they determine what's important

[01:41:11.230 --> 01:41:12.250]
enough to print

[01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:16.990]
so they'll take whatever story they can get that they can run with them so more

[01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:18.210]
newspapers out of it

[01:41:18.210 --> 01:41:20.710]
and that's why nobody's really calling you

[01:41:20.710 --> 01:41:24.210]
yelling and screaming because you know like these things come

[01:41:24.210 --> 01:41:26.310]
everybody expects it to happen

[01:41:26.810 --> 01:41:28.230]
and then they leave it alone

[01:41:29.150 --> 01:41:31.190]
okay got unfortunate have a great thing

[01:41:31.190 --> 01:41:31.870]
are you good

[01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:35.050]

but i'm a teacher and uh... you know i think that

[01:43:25.690 --> 01:43:29.590]
uh... you know we just got going back and forth i think we said we centralized

[01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:31.190]
a problem and focus on

[01:43:31.190 --> 01:43:33.190]
the problem home with the parents

[01:43:33.730 --> 01:43:36.330]
you know i think that's the number one problem right there man

[01:43:36.330 --> 01:43:36.890]
yeah

[01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:41.090]
they keep throwing stuff at the teacher teachers teachers at you know i'm a

[01:43:41.090 --> 01:43:42.310]
teacher and i go out of my way

[01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:43.990]
it's got to be the best possible

[01:43:44.570 --> 01:43:47.910]
for us to be the classroom and try to you know guide the kids right away but i

[01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:49.430]
mean without the parents support home

[01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:51.430]
i mean things that don't work so i mean we got

[01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:53.210]
you know blame it teacher

[01:43:53.210 --> 01:43:56.710]
what is what was parental support after the with a forty-year-old teacher who's

[01:43:56.710 --> 01:43:57.790]
having sex with her students

[01:43:57.790 --> 01:44:00.470]
and having a couple of mishak up in her condo

[01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:04.430]
well okay i mean maybe not so much uh... for it well for the person for the

[01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:04.770]
teacher

[01:44:05.230 --> 01:44:07.650]
depending on you know whatever issues going on in school

[01:44:08.210 --> 01:44:10.530]
in terms of teaching at home with a tough fight out but i'm saying

[01:44:10.530 --> 01:44:14.050]
the kids at home need to be taught more old than that they should order for them

[01:44:14.050 --> 01:44:15.310]
to know what's right and wrong

[01:44:17.090 --> 01:44:18.410]
yeah i'm going to get that

[01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:20.330]
you understand what i'm saying so i mean

[01:44:20.850 --> 01:44:23.810]
you know i think parents need to become more responsible and i do agree

[01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:26.390]
that some teachers out there have no business being a classroom but

[01:44:27.010 --> 01:44:29.190]
i think we had to focus a little more on the parents

[01:44:29.190 --> 01:44:31.050]
maybe we could put her to work at a strip joint

[01:44:31.410 --> 01:44:34.630]
yeah i think it's a little bit too late for best okay pal have a great day

[01:47:58.610 --> 01:48:01.030]
because that thing for a mistinkle hasn't come on yet today

[01:48:03.610 --> 01:48:06.650]
let's applaud right ahead here okay onward and upward here's Miami hello

[01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:15.290]
Miami hello yes sir i fail to hear like teacher i'm a teacher myself i fail to

[01:48:15.290 --> 01:48:18.130]
hear teachers talk about as they're going to school to learn to be teachers

[01:48:18.130 --> 01:48:21.670]
they learn a code of ethics and before they sign their contract and get hired

[01:48:21.670 --> 01:48:27.770]
they're also told about the consequences of actions like that of having sex with a teenage

[01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:32.330]
or getting involved and i also fail to hear everybody's not making a big deal

[01:48:32.330 --> 01:48:36.990]
how 15 year old boy with a 48-year-old teacher but they seem to forget about seven

[01:48:36.990 --> 01:48:41.010]
years ago they even made a movie about this world 15 year old kid at sex with a

[01:48:41.010 --> 01:48:43.470]
teacher and the teacher convinced him to kill her husband

[01:48:44.210 --> 01:48:48.130]
right that's the teacher in the winger right and they fail to forget this day

[01:48:48.130 --> 01:48:54.010]
yeah this kid's a horny kid but this person is 34 years old has the mentality the mentality of

[01:48:54.010 --> 01:48:58.830]
a wiser adult then this kid's kid's only thinking about you know getting that piece of ass

[01:48:58.830 --> 01:49:03.070]
right you know and she's exploiting him and using drugs and the car and everything to lure him on

[01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:07.290]
and there's no outrage about it that's the thing that i find amazing nobody seems pissed off about

[01:49:07.290 --> 01:49:12.310]
i'm mad at it because i'm a teacher and i i work with children during school time and after

[01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:18.250]
school i coach children and i know my ethical point of how far i can go with these kids and what

[01:49:18.250 --> 01:49:22.050]
i can say to them and what i what i'm able to talk to them about and i feel to hear the teachers

[01:49:22.050 --> 01:49:25.950]
speak about what they've learned while they were going to school to learn to be a teacher

[01:49:25.950 --> 01:49:32.530]
of what their main purpose is is to make these children good adults to make them you know

[01:49:32.530 --> 01:49:39.110]
profound adults regardless of what they're teaching to make them you know responsible young people

[01:49:39.110 --> 01:49:45.030]
yeah and and i i'm like totally a part that i have to see what calling was not a big deal if my

[01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:49.790]
son was getting i wish i was getting it right right that's right it is a big deal and again keep in

[01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:54.790]
mind that if it were the reverse it was a male teacher and it was a 14 year old girl the audience

[01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:59.590]
would be apoplectic you would have eight zillion people especially the father's calling and saying

[01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:04.090]
where do we find i've got my shotgun i'll personally go down and blow his brains out because that's

[01:50:04.090 --> 01:50:07.590]
the kind of rick zard whoops sexist country that we live in you would have rick zanches on the

[01:50:07.590 --> 01:50:12.070]
core house he'd squatting on their head that's right we're talking about how this is a

[01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:17.050]
button and i these teachers can't just act like oh my god i didn't notice they learned this

[01:50:17.050 --> 01:50:20.870]
they learned this when they were they're going to school and even before they find the contract

[01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:25.550]
they learned this i'm totally appalled and i think that they should be this teacher should be

[01:50:25.550 --> 01:50:31.450]
fired and prosecuted to the folks that regardless of sex whether it's a male teacher or female

[01:50:31.450 --> 01:50:36.770]
teacher or principal or anybody they should be totally taken to the folks and a lot they should

[01:50:36.770 --> 01:50:43.090]
be fired without paying because they did learn this and they have a moral upbringing and they have

[01:50:43.090 --> 01:50:48.650]
they have a standard they have to uphold each other are putting into our trust by the parents

[01:50:48.650 --> 01:50:52.130]
every day for eight hours and then you see when you get into a position whether it's a priest

[01:50:52.130 --> 01:50:57.770]
whether it's a scout leader whether it's a teacher and the kids are putting your care and then

[01:50:57.770 --> 01:51:01.730]
you abuse them and you exploit it then you got to face the consequences i mean i like to think

[01:51:01.730 --> 01:51:05.690]

[01:52:40.450 --> 01:52:45.310]
five six seven probably school board guy five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the

[01:52:45.310 --> 01:52:49.410]
bubble one line here's a mobile in the gables hello hey Neil how's it going another case from

[01:52:49.530 --> 01:52:56.610]
line with you you know it's all more out i mean teachers are taught we're taught that two

[01:52:56.610 --> 01:53:02.250]
things you can't do at school and bell's of money and touch the students now you have these two

[01:53:02.250 --> 01:53:06.470]
teachers up in four water to know that we're having this sex club now that's being totally

[01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:10.810]
exploited and the school boards making a big bruhaha about it and putting them on the spotlight because

[01:53:10.810 --> 01:53:17.830]
this teachers you're you're my contract you are supposed to maintain higher uh moral standards

[01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:22.610]
which means you can't be an alcoholic getting slashed at the local pub right you know parents are

[01:53:22.610 --> 01:53:26.870]
the students seeing you so they the school board has a legitimate gripe with those teachers i

[01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:30.650]
think it's outrageous though because when you have teachers molesting students the school board

[01:53:30.650 --> 01:53:34.990]
wants to keep it all quiet hushed up and try to settle out of court and just you know change for

[01:53:34.990 --> 01:53:38.190]
the teacher to a different school they're in a high school and they mess around with the student

[01:53:38.190 --> 01:53:42.730]
they hushed up and they sent them to an elementary school get them out from a adult you know almost

[01:53:42.730 --> 01:53:48.730]
sound like the church to me right yeah now you know they want to like uh carry flags and saying see

[01:53:48.730 --> 01:53:52.550]
we're trying to protect the students these two teachers in the sex club were really given it to them

[01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:59.030]
i wonder how many students were in there well none you know it's just that the school board is so

[01:53:59.030 --> 01:54:03.230]
hypocritical they want to keep everything very quiet you know when students are hurt or you know

[01:54:03.230 --> 01:54:07.450]
or put in harm's way let's just shut it up and maybe it'll go away yeah and and the same thing

[01:54:07.450 --> 01:54:10.830]
looks ahead but hasn't that been a way in the public school system for even when i was going to

[01:54:10.830 --> 01:54:15.770]
school sweet everything out of the carpet don't make any waves keep it quiet because otherwise

[01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:20.230]
we're in deep crap but here's something where no students will harm so let's make this one you

[01:54:20.230 --> 01:54:24.830]
know let's keep this one out in the and out in the open be make it noisy so the she that we are

[01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:28.890]
doing our best to make sure the classrooms a safe environment and you know something if those

[01:54:28.890 --> 01:54:33.670]
teachers if those people's privacy had been respected and those teachers names would never been

[01:54:33.670 --> 01:54:37.710]
released in the first place which they shouldn't have been then the students would have would have no

[01:54:37.710 --> 01:54:42.030]
different opinion of them and he would anybody else but you know that's that's the media and

[01:54:42.030 --> 01:54:46.410]
that's uh... you know that's a lot of things you can know one person is to blame i think we need

[01:54:46.410 --> 01:54:51.090]
to heart more on these police officers with the sixteen year old and kennel i'm really upset that

[01:54:51.090 --> 01:54:56.190]
that's been sort of hushed down more than my breath let me know when the exhale with the county uh...

[01:54:56.190 --> 01:54:59.850]

[02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:38.350]
hey Neil how you doing okay sir um you know i i think a lot of this problem is parents and cells

[02:01:38.350 --> 02:01:43.050]
out i i believe that the parents don't know where the kids are so they must have a lot of time

[02:01:43.050 --> 02:01:50.010]
on their hands those sex is not wrong um i think i think that uh i find it is pretty

[02:01:50.010 --> 02:01:54.110]
i'm in place for you know i find it a pretty far stress that we got people here especially

[02:01:54.110 --> 02:01:59.110]
sexist guys trying to justify a 40-year-old woman having sex with a 14-year-old boy you know

[02:01:59.690 --> 02:02:05.150]
well i i don't know if i justify it or not it's just that thirty nine maybe but maybe maybe

[02:02:05.150 --> 02:02:12.630]
maybe the uh manipulation was you know and the the the alcohol and the drugs that's wrong

[02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:19.650]
uh well we all agree on that i just i just i think i think parents need to

[02:02:20.130 --> 02:02:23.590]
watch where their kids are yeah if they're being if they're not being so

[02:02:23.590 --> 02:02:28.450]
goodbye if you had a 15 or 14-year-old son and he came home with okay and he came home

[02:02:28.450 --> 02:02:34.130]
with a car one day wouldn't you be a little bit stupid like hey uh Eddie what did i come from pal

[02:02:34.750 --> 02:02:39.490]
we would you get that we're gonna steal that car and we know we're gonna license number one

[02:02:39.490 --> 02:02:45.910]
right that age uh um uh i don't i don't know whether he had a license or not but if you know i

[02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:52.010]
i know where my son at right now he's over at the high school playing football okay that's what

[02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:56.450]
they all say when they go over to the city that i i i make sure that's that's where he's at i go

[02:02:56.450 --> 02:03:01.430]
out and i watch some of his practices right i i i get involved with my child i know where my

[02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:06.730]
child is good if my child is over at another friend's house then i know that the parents there

[02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:13.350]
know where they are what they're doing you just not gonna go run the streets and be with his friends

[02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:18.430]
that where they're half backwards and they're drawers hanging down in their ass you know absolutely

[02:03:18.430 --> 02:03:23.750]
i would not let my child do that good time and and and and and the and the teachers themselves

[02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:29.990]
this is the thing is like a baseball and even in a baseball rule book if you look up section 900

[02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:37.110]
and in there it says that umpires as opposed to you left unapproachable what are these what are

[02:03:37.110 --> 02:03:42.270]
these teachers doing you know these teachers are are there they're they're they're hanging

[02:03:43.130 --> 02:03:51.930]
i i've seen my my kids have teachers that are that are mean and nasty yeah and i see this all

[02:03:51.930 --> 02:03:57.970]
the time and when it and until the government decides to start cracking down on this whole situation

[02:03:57.970 --> 02:04:03.950]
it's not going to get any better and we have a lot of problems and you're just not going to get

[02:04:03.950 --> 02:04:10.110]
any better until they just start dealing with them sticks on the lawn in your bus get your sticks at

[02:04:10.110 --> 02:04:16.090]
the exit i did that back to you well i know i had that set up for you know i had to wait but it's

[02:04:16.090 --> 02:04:21.330]
still a good idea they're kind of like stick it in the folks i'd like to see a song about

[02:04:21.330 --> 02:04:29.210]
the American children about me about you about the way our American hearts beat way down in the

[02:04:29.210 --> 02:04:35.670]
bottom of our chest about that special feeling we get in that tackle for all of us maybe go over that

[02:04:35.670 --> 02:04:47.370]
maybe in the sub-copy area maybe in the liver maybe in the kidneys maybe even in the colon we don't know

[02:04:47.370 --> 02:04:54.310]
i'm the student regular Joe with a regular job on your average white

[02:04:54.310 --> 02:05:02.750]
except for the nice one i like the fall and for now it's about four i got an average house

[02:05:02.750 --> 02:05:11.850]
where the nice heart would fall my wife and my job my kids and my car up to my table and the

[02:05:11.850 --> 02:05:15.130]
children to go

[02:05:16.030 --> 02:05:21.330]
but sometimes i just hate enough to keep a man like me

[02:05:21.330 --> 02:05:29.810]
know it uh uh no i've got to go out of town and have fun at someone else's expense

[02:05:29.810 --> 02:05:34.490]
well yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i try really

[02:05:35.130 --> 02:05:40.730]
in the old for bad things while people to see a nice piece of art go in the

[02:05:50.070 --> 02:05:56.730]
high public toilet and i just i'm a sweet how i walk around in the summer time saying

[02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:07.530]
yes i am

[02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:10.670]
In the candy-cats spaces

[02:06:10.670 --> 02:06:12.730]
Wow, candy-cats people

[02:06:12.730 --> 02:06:14.590]
Make candy-cats the taste

[02:06:14.590 --> 02:06:16.690]
I'm gonna show you the night

[02:06:16.690 --> 02:06:19.050]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[02:06:19.050 --> 02:06:20.710]
I'm gonna show you the

[02:06:20.710 --> 02:06:21.830]
F***ing night

[02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:23.610]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[02:06:23.610 --> 02:06:26.970]
Baby, I should be the same in your soul

[02:06:26.970 --> 02:06:31.370]
Ranting and raising and carrying on

[02:06:31.370 --> 02:06:34.770]
Baby, they're right for they sell me out

[02:06:41.710 --> 02:06:43.470]
Oh, oh, oh

[02:06:43.470 --> 02:06:46.570]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[02:06:46.570 --> 02:06:46.730]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[02:06:46.730 --> 02:06:46.750]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[02:06:46.750 --> 02:06:46.750]

[02:06:46.750 --> 02:06:46.790]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:47.910]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:49.430]
You know what I'm gonna do?

[02:06:49.670 --> 02:06:51.570]
I'm gonna get my stuff when I'm in 1957

[02:06:51.570 --> 02:06:53.390]
And I killed a rattle in a carnival

[02:06:53.390 --> 02:06:56.170]
I think with a whale in a hop-cats

[02:06:56.170 --> 02:06:58.390]
And all other cow and terrier

[02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:59.550]
And thinks brown babies

[02:06:59.550 --> 02:07:00.770]
And steal lines for headlines

[02:07:00.770 --> 02:07:03.170]
Yeah, I'm gonna cry for having that 80s

[02:07:03.170 --> 02:07:04.750]
At 150 miles per hour

[02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:06.110]
Just getting one model for gallons

[02:07:06.110 --> 02:07:07.550]
I can now afford a fine of two

[02:07:07.550 --> 02:07:09.150]
Third of my town in the old fashioned

[02:07:09.150 --> 02:07:10.870]
Not buy a grain of old sourpool containers

[02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:13.190]
And when I'm done sucking down those sweet ball burgers

[02:07:13.190 --> 02:07:15.370]
I'm gonna wipe my mom's in the Americans flag

[02:07:15.370 --> 02:07:17.150]
And then I'm gonna toss the sourpool containers

[02:07:17.150 --> 02:07:18.890]
Right on the side, it depends on the guy

[02:07:18.890 --> 02:07:20.530]
Damn, I'm saying anybody can do a fine

[02:07:20.530 --> 02:07:22.730]
You know why? Because we got the bottom

[02:07:22.730 --> 02:07:24.230]
That's why, two words

[02:07:24.230 --> 02:07:25.970]
You know we are f***ing westerns

[02:07:25.970 --> 02:07:28.150]
Okay, Russia, Germany, Romania

[02:07:28.150 --> 02:07:29.790]
They can have all the democracy they want

[02:07:29.790 --> 02:07:32.170]
They can have a big democracy take the walk right to the middle

[02:07:32.170 --> 02:07:34.310]
And get them into the rest and it won't make a lick of difference

[02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:35.610]
They got weighing out the bottom

[02:07:35.610 --> 02:07:37.710]
So, guys, John Wayne, that's it

[02:07:37.710 --> 02:07:40.390]
He's frozen! And as soon as we find a cure for a candor

[02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:41.370]
We're gonna throw out the juice

[02:07:41.370 --> 02:07:42.650]
And he's gonna be pretty pissed off

[02:07:42.650 --> 02:07:44.630]
You know why? I've drove a tank in a cold shower

[02:07:44.630 --> 02:07:46.710]
We'll multiply that by 50 million times

[02:07:46.710 --> 02:07:48.270]
That's how pissed off the juice can I be?

[02:07:48.390 --> 02:07:49.770]
I'm gonna get the juice, he's a giant cat

[02:07:49.770 --> 02:07:52.150]
And we harvest it and can't take it away

[02:07:52.150 --> 02:07:55.590]
And a case of what he tried on a day to say, you know who really are?

[02:07:55.590 --> 02:07:58.950]
lake

[02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:32.870]
And with all apologies that that caller was just a rousing success, okay?

[02:08:32.970 --> 02:08:34.270]
We couldn't wait another three seconds.

[02:08:38.530 --> 02:08:41.510]
Oh my God, it was a slaughtered day.

[02:08:42.090 --> 02:08:44.650]
But heads, it's a one to two hour.

[02:08:46.090 --> 02:08:48.470]
Hi, I'm Dr. Laura Slesen here.

[02:08:48.970 --> 02:08:53.990]
And I'm here to tell you a little bit about Bouching because it takes a real sour plus

[02:08:53.990 --> 02:08:58.410]
bitch like me to tell you how to do it right beside you don't know how to do it anyway.

[02:08:58.590 --> 02:08:59.410]
Probably too stupid.

[02:08:59.950 --> 02:09:06.410]
But what I do is I spread my leg like this, kind of upside down and squish in Honda

[02:09:06.830 --> 02:09:07.250]
Rosalemans.

[02:09:07.650 --> 02:09:10.390]
Nothing works better than Honda Rosalemans.

[02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:11.670]
Give it a little squish.

[02:09:13.110 --> 02:09:13.930]
All right.

[02:09:14.230 --> 02:09:17.170]
And the reason I play that is because Brian and Boiton Beach factors me a thing from

[02:09:17.170 --> 02:09:17.650]
Hustle Magazine.

[02:09:17.650 --> 02:09:18.910]
Guess who's the asshole of the month?

[02:09:19.150 --> 02:09:19.830]
It's Dr. Laura.

[02:09:20.150 --> 02:09:20.790]
It's excellent.

[02:09:20.930 --> 02:09:21.810]
Nice going, Larry Flint.

[02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:25.350]
Got a whole long, I read it to say a great article.

[02:09:25.350 --> 02:09:28.290]
We don't have time to read it on the air, but a whole list of things about what a lying

[02:09:28.290 --> 02:09:29.210]
bitch she is, you know?

[02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:33.390]
She brags that she put her career on hold for her son's infancy, but she doesn't reveal

[02:09:33.390 --> 02:09:35.270]
that she had three incomes during the boys childhood.

[02:09:35.790 --> 02:09:39.270]
She preaches honor thy mother, but has been estranged from her own mother for 15 years

[02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:41.050]
and has never introduced the woman to her son.

[02:09:41.690 --> 02:09:45.750]
She found that interm aeth marriages, her husband raised the Piscopalian, has not converted

[02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:46.310]
to Judaism.

[02:09:47.050 --> 02:09:50.230]
She talks of being poverty-stricken while her husband was out of work, but he can't remember

[02:09:50.230 --> 02:09:51.830]
an expected period of unemployment.

[02:09:52.350 --> 02:09:55.670]
She castigates people who divorce and leave children, her husband was a married father

[02:09:55.670 --> 02:09:56.710]
of three when she met him.

[02:09:57.570 --> 02:10:01.470]
She has no patience with anyone who complains of poverty, but her show runs ads for Italian

[02:10:01.470 --> 02:10:04.010]
vacations and BMW 7 Series today.

[02:10:04.510 --> 02:10:08.510]
She preaches appropriation over career, but waited until she was at the age of a grandma

[02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:09.550]
to drop her one kid.

[02:10:10.030 --> 02:10:14.650]
She flaunts family values and societal structure, yet sticks her kid with a surname, slushender,

[02:10:14.710 --> 02:10:15.830]
instead of a name of her husband.

[02:10:16.190 --> 02:10:19.550]
I'm Judge Mendoly, she boasts the Bible Caution's Judge Not.

[02:10:19.550 --> 02:10:23.330]
These are just ten of the stupid things that make Dr. Lorraine asshole mess.

[02:10:23.630 --> 02:10:24.130]
Let's hear it.

[02:10:24.270 --> 02:10:25.830]
Hillary Flinagan, okay, Hustle magazine.

[02:10:26.330 --> 02:10:27.890]
Dr. Lorraine, she be the asshole of the month.

[02:10:29.550 --> 02:10:30.230]
Thank you, Brian.

[02:10:31.310 --> 02:10:34.670]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the 18th T-line blog.

[02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:38.790]
I tell you that soup, I think, is what really put me back on the, or even keel here and

[02:10:38.790 --> 02:10:40.830]
got the last pants stuff out of my system.

[02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.170]
Yeah.

[02:10:41.450 --> 02:10:42.110]
Thanks a lot, Jim.

[02:10:44.410 --> 02:10:45.110]
Here's Parine.

[02:10:45.250 --> 02:10:45.390]
Hello.

[02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.910]
Hey, Neil.

[02:10:47.150 --> 02:10:47.450]
Yes, sir.

[02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:50.790]
I was a guy who's talking about Asperine a little while ago.

[02:10:50.930 --> 02:10:51.370]
Got cut off.

[02:10:51.370 --> 02:10:52.110]
Oh, sorry about that.

[02:10:52.250 --> 02:10:53.450]
Well, that was only a couple hours ago.

[02:10:53.450 --> 02:10:54.410]
Let's start all over again.

[02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:56.150]
Yeah, now it was lightning strike.

[02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:56.970]
It took the phone out.

[02:10:56.970 --> 02:10:57.530]
Was that what it was?

[02:10:57.790 --> 02:10:59.230]
Don't tell me it's porn again out there.

[02:10:59.950 --> 02:11:02.250]
It's thunder and pretty bad for crying out loud.

[02:11:02.310 --> 02:11:04.390]
Jesus Christ, it started to get like Florida down here.

[02:11:04.830 --> 02:11:05.730]
Oh, yeah, it's ridiculous.

[02:11:05.870 --> 02:11:07.110]
Man, I'm sick of it.

[02:11:07.250 --> 02:11:07.610]
Definitely.

[02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:10.230]
Anyway, what the Asperine was that was talking to you about?

[02:11:11.110 --> 02:11:15.810]
The problem when you drink it in a diet soda or eat it in a product or whatever.

[02:11:16.230 --> 02:11:16.590]
Yeah.

[02:11:17.250 --> 02:11:17.610]
Exactly.

[02:11:18.010 --> 02:11:21.930]
It, uh, methanol comes out of it and it fits in your system and poisons you.

[02:11:22.370 --> 02:11:26.170]
And then the methanol breaks down into formaldehyde.

[02:11:26.370 --> 02:11:27.290]
Oh, and the ethanol do.

[02:11:27.510 --> 02:11:27.990]
It'll make it.

[02:11:28.290 --> 02:11:28.510]
Yeah.

[02:11:28.830 --> 02:11:29.510]
That big time.

[02:11:30.150 --> 02:11:34.930]
And, uh, it's a slow, cumulative poisoning that, you know, every time you drink it or

[02:11:34.930 --> 02:11:37.150]
ingest it, it builds up and builds up and builds up.

[02:11:37.170 --> 02:11:38.650]
I bet you that's what happened, David Crosby.

[02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:40.250]
Wasn't all that booze, I bet you was Asperine.

[02:11:40.670 --> 02:11:41.590]
Hey, I could have been in that room.

[02:11:41.590 --> 02:11:42.230]
I bet you were up.

[02:11:42.230 --> 02:11:47.430]
So what the problem is, like with the methanol, it starts to degenerate your optic nerves

[02:11:47.430 --> 02:11:51.330]
and it causes dry eyes and all a whole slew of problems.

[02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:51.730]
It's a fun thing.

[02:11:52.810 --> 02:11:53.170]
Wow.

[02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:54.090]
Oh, big time.

[02:11:54.090 --> 02:11:55.710]
No more diet sodas for this kid.

[02:11:55.890 --> 02:11:58.210]
I've drank up drunk my last, uh, I've had it.

[02:11:58.610 --> 02:12:00.030]
And you know, I'm serious about that.

[02:12:00.290 --> 02:12:02.970]
You know, when you're on a plane and they ask you to offer you a beverage, which for the

[02:12:02.970 --> 02:12:05.650]
money that they're charged and even if you don't want to eat their crappy food, you're

[02:12:05.650 --> 02:12:06.310]
going to have the beverage.

[02:12:06.610 --> 02:12:08.810]
Get your club soda, parier, something like that.

[02:12:09.150 --> 02:12:10.730]
You don't have to have a stupid diet coke.

[02:12:11.310 --> 02:12:14.850]
Remember the FendFend product that was out of log, it was great for losing weight,

[02:12:15.150 --> 02:12:17.650]
phenyl fallinine, which is the major component of it.

[02:12:17.710 --> 02:12:17.930]
That's right.

[02:12:18.130 --> 02:12:21.230]
And Asperine as well, which is a major lead problem.

[02:12:21.450 --> 02:12:21.670]
Great.

[02:12:22.190 --> 02:12:22.770]
Very bad.

[02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:24.030]
It's like nothing good in it at all.

[02:12:24.330 --> 02:12:28.790]
And the big kicker of the diet sodas is that after you have it for a while, it actually

[02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:30.190]
promotes weight gain.

[02:12:30.430 --> 02:12:31.430]
And most people think they're going to lose weight.

[02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:34.150]
You know, something I think you just hit on my problem.

[02:12:34.330 --> 02:12:34.490]
You know what?

[02:12:34.670 --> 02:12:36.230]
I haven't been able to, I stay the same.

[02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:40.430]
And even when I have really great days, two, three, four of mineral, that scale won't

[02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:41.430]
barely budge.

[02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:45.970]
And if that goddamn diet sodas, I've read that, even Atkins, by the way, on his diet, says

[02:12:45.970 --> 02:12:51.110]
some people who have an allergic reaction to it, it prevents them from losing any weight

[02:12:51.110 --> 02:12:51.410]
at all.

[02:12:51.870 --> 02:12:53.530]
I think he's got his thumb on it.

[02:12:53.730 --> 02:12:54.390]
It's unbelievable.

[02:12:54.870 --> 02:12:58.870]
Anyway, I wanted to ask you before I go, when you run the best of shows, do you pick

[02:12:58.870 --> 02:13:00.890]
those or just manage them, or what?

[02:13:01.070 --> 02:13:01.170]
I was very worried.

[02:13:01.170 --> 02:13:01.950]
George picks them.

[02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:03.230]
I don't pick them.

[02:13:03.710 --> 02:13:04.410]
But who does?

[02:13:04.710 --> 02:13:06.110]
Whoever shows up to run it.

[02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:07.690]
Because what's right?

[02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:08.390]
I'm over here.

[02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:09.450]
Oh, we don't run that many.

[02:13:09.550 --> 02:13:12.450]
Only when George and I are both out, or like it's an official holiday, we both have the

[02:13:12.450 --> 02:13:12.770]
day off.

[02:13:13.090 --> 02:13:15.550]
So there's a stack of them over there, and whoever comes in, they pick it.

[02:13:15.950 --> 02:13:19.830]
Because like last Friday, you guys ran one, and it was, you had said you were like your

[02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:23.690]
seventh week back from your right, you know, when you left IOD and came back to the radio

[02:13:23.690 --> 02:13:23.930]
on the weekend.

[02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:28.650]
And then you were talking about a story where you had to run two of the same commercial

[02:13:28.650 --> 02:13:30.350]
breaks in the same five minutes spot.

[02:13:30.690 --> 02:13:34.010]
And when you're walking out to your car after the show, two o'clock, one of your co-workers

[02:13:34.010 --> 02:13:35.730]
comes out and was talking to you about it.

[02:13:35.730 --> 02:13:39.170]
And then some bitch, Luann, or screw-in, or something like that.

[02:13:39.610 --> 02:13:43.630]
And yelling is screaming, burrating this guy like a child, and you were going on and on.

[02:13:43.710 --> 02:13:45.370]
No, that was the, was the water not to show?

[02:13:46.250 --> 02:13:46.930]
Uh, yeah.

[02:13:47.410 --> 02:13:48.130]
The water not to.

[02:13:48.190 --> 02:13:48.610]
That's the one.

[02:13:49.110 --> 02:13:52.650]
Do you know, whatever it was, you were just ripping QAM, a new one.

[02:13:52.730 --> 02:13:52.850]
Good.

[02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:54.270]
I feel like I'll pick that one off.

[02:13:54.330 --> 02:13:55.190]
See, must have done that on purpose.

[02:13:55.790 --> 02:13:58.490]
It was hilarious because they could run it again and again.

[02:13:58.690 --> 02:14:00.450]
And again, it's like, they're like, massive kids.

[02:14:00.590 --> 02:14:02.390]
They don't, they like the youth themselves.

[02:14:02.610 --> 02:14:03.290]
They're rip on the air.

[02:14:03.290 --> 02:14:06.450]
No, actually the producers, whoever's in working at, they pick it out.

[02:14:06.550 --> 02:14:09.070]
And actually they hate these people like poison, so they do it on purpose.

[02:14:09.690 --> 02:14:09.830]
Right.

[02:14:10.030 --> 02:14:11.490]
Because they're getting the screw over left and right.

[02:14:11.570 --> 02:14:12.950]
They're not making enough money to rub them together.

[02:14:13.450 --> 02:14:14.430]
Okay, but I have a great day.

[02:14:14.630 --> 02:14:15.090]
Okay, thank you.

[02:14:15.090 --> 02:14:16.110]
And no more of that crap.

[02:14:17.310 --> 02:14:18.810]
No more aspirate, okay?

[02:14:19.050 --> 02:14:20.630]
As is okay, but no aspirate.

[02:14:20.850 --> 02:14:22.730]
That's the message for all your kids out there, okay?

[02:14:23.490 --> 02:14:24.290]
Getting blown away.

[02:14:24.670 --> 02:14:26.770]
That's the American way, but getting blown, that's bad.

[02:14:27.230 --> 02:14:28.010]
That'd be real bad.

[02:14:29.530 --> 02:14:31.310]
Except if it's in the oral office.

[02:14:31.310 --> 02:14:32.370]
Show me yours.

[02:14:32.490 --> 02:14:33.350]
I'll show you mine.

[02:15:09.010 --> 02:15:20.970]
I'm going to show you mine.

[02:15:20.970 --> 02:15:20.970]

[02:15:20.970 --> 02:15:20.970]

[02:15:20.970 --> 02:15:20.970]

[02:15:20.970 --> 02:15:20.970]

[02:15:20.970 --> 02:15:21.050]
I'm going to show you mine.

[02:15:21.070 --> 02:15:21.630]
I'm going to show you mine.

[02:15:22.970 --> 02:15:24.710]
I'm going to show you mine.

[02:15:24.710 --> 02:15:24.710]

[02:15:24.710 --> 02:15:24.710]

[02:15:24.710 --> 02:15:24.830]
I'm going to show you mine.

[02:15:25.110 --> 02:15:27.010]
I'm going to show you mine.

[02:15:27.170 --> 02:15:31.290]
I'm going to show you mine.

[02:15:45.330 --> 02:15:46.410]
I'm going to show you mine.

[02:15:48.450 --> 02:15:48.690]
I'm going to show you mine.

[02:15:49.190 --> 02:15:49.210]
I'm going to show you mine.

[02:15:49.210 --> 02:15:49.210]

[02:15:49.210 --> 02:15:49.210]

[02:15:49.210 --> 02:15:49.210]

[02:15:49.210 --> 02:15:49.210]

[02:15:49.210 --> 02:15:49.230]
I'm going to show you mine.

[02:15:49.230 --> 02:15:49.230]

[02:15:49.230 --> 02:15:49.230]

[02:15:49.690 --> 02:15:51.190]
I'm going to show you mine.

[02:15:51.770 --> 02:15:52.550]
I'm going to show you mine.

[02:15:52.550 --> 02:15:54.050]
I'm going to show you mine.

[02:15:54.050 --> 02:16:01.210]
I'm going to show you mine.

[02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:05.190]
How's that plan for Matt Philharth?

[02:16:05.470 --> 02:16:06.110]
No, no.

[02:16:06.110 --> 02:16:06.790]
You're not here that no one.

[02:16:10.130 --> 02:16:13.530]
That was a fact, Boy, weren't there very long before?

[02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:16.830]
We've just had great stories, including Fat Boy, by the way.

[02:16:16.890 --> 02:16:18.410]
You know something Fat Boy, I'll tell you what?

[02:16:18.690 --> 02:16:22.190]
By 2 o'clock, 46 and half minutes from now, and I know you've been in the building

[02:16:22.190 --> 02:16:25.830]
with your big Fat Ogley body all day long because you have inspired reports on it,

[02:16:26.590 --> 02:16:29.650]
either I'm going to have that pair of tickets for some dolphin games this season

[02:16:29.650 --> 02:16:31.090]
that I asked for for some friend of mine.

[02:16:31.290 --> 02:16:32.290]
Either I'm going to have those,

[02:16:32.550 --> 02:16:35.130]
or I want my dolphin dill tickets and a parking pass

[02:16:35.130 --> 02:16:36.830]
back that I gave you, all right?

[02:16:37.290 --> 02:16:38.770]
And I have no idea why I gave him to you.

[02:16:39.390 --> 02:16:41.630]
In a moment of weakness, in a moment of elusive

[02:16:41.630 --> 02:16:43.170]
any kind of judgment at all.

[02:16:44.510 --> 02:16:46.930]
What a lying big sack of crap.

[02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:48.410]
Oh, yes, Pally, I'm getting them today.

[02:16:48.450 --> 02:16:49.070]
I'll bring them to you tomorrow.

[02:16:49.290 --> 02:16:50.730]
He's in the building and of course laying low

[02:16:50.730 --> 02:16:51.950]
because he knows God damn well.

[02:16:52.170 --> 02:16:53.270]
He don't have any dolphin tickets

[02:16:54.050 --> 02:16:55.990]
because Ray Perry probably wouldn't even look at him.

[02:16:57.330 --> 02:16:58.590]
Nice going, fat boy.

[02:16:59.070 --> 02:17:01.510]
He was a piece of crap on 79th Street.

[02:17:01.730 --> 02:17:04.370]
He was a big fat, smelly piece of turnted paction

[02:17:04.370 --> 02:17:07.610]
and they brought him over here and he's still the same.

[02:17:08.730 --> 02:17:10.430]
Here's the facts from Barton West Palm.

[02:17:11.630 --> 02:17:12.990]
He says the kindergarten teacher decides

[02:17:12.990 --> 02:17:15.270]
he's going to give a lesson object about the five senses.

[02:17:15.890 --> 02:17:17.150]
He wants to start with taste.

[02:17:17.730 --> 02:17:19.770]
So if he brings flavored sucking candies to class,

[02:17:20.330 --> 02:17:22.870]
blindfolds the children and ask them each to taste one.

[02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:25.470]
The students have no problem identifying

[02:17:25.470 --> 02:17:26.670]
the cherry and lime flavors.

[02:17:26.850 --> 02:17:28.210]
But when it comes to the honey suckers,

[02:17:28.210 --> 02:17:29.570]
they're stumped.

[02:17:29.570 --> 02:17:30.870]
I'll give you a hint the teacher says,

[02:17:31.230 --> 02:17:33.050]
you may sometimes hear your mommies and daddy's

[02:17:33.050 --> 02:17:34.470]
call each other this flavor at home.

[02:17:34.970 --> 02:17:36.830]
Spit them out, spit them out, Christ one child.

[02:17:37.090 --> 02:17:37.770]
They're assholes.

[02:17:40.130 --> 02:17:41.430]
Ha, ha, ha.

[02:17:42.190 --> 02:17:42.830]
All right.

[02:17:44.670 --> 02:17:46.570]
Five, six, seven, oh five, thank you Bart.

[02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:48.630]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60,

[02:17:48.770 --> 02:17:50.630]
pound, five, 60 on the AT&T line.

[02:17:51.090 --> 02:17:52.050]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:52.310]
Hello.

[02:17:53.050 --> 02:17:53.910]
Hello Neil, how are you?

[02:17:53.970 --> 02:17:54.430]
Okay, sir.

[02:17:54.710 --> 02:17:57.110]
Okay, so what's all the confusion about when people

[02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:58.370]
are old enough to have sex?

[02:17:59.250 --> 02:18:00.050]
You know, it's the...

[02:18:00.050 --> 02:18:00.970]
What's all the confusion?

[02:18:01.370 --> 02:18:03.570]
Yeah, it's like you can't see the forest from the trees.

[02:18:03.950 --> 02:18:05.310]
And yeah, answer is so obvious.

[02:18:05.790 --> 02:18:06.390]
I can't see it.

[02:18:06.450 --> 02:18:07.170]
How about the whole audience?

[02:18:07.350 --> 02:18:07.850]
Can they see it?

[02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.630]
I guess not.

[02:18:08.730 --> 02:18:09.790]
Are you the one that can see it?

[02:18:09.850 --> 02:18:10.530]
You're the one, okay?

[02:18:10.690 --> 02:18:12.070]
It leads us out of the wilderness

[02:18:12.070 --> 02:18:13.410]
into the world of your realities.

[02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:16.170]
Well, the answer comes from Mother Nature and Biology.

[02:18:16.490 --> 02:18:16.670]
Yeah.

[02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.590]
It's a puberty.

[02:18:18.970 --> 02:18:19.530]
Meaning what?

[02:18:20.850 --> 02:18:23.290]
That's, that's when someone's old enough to have sex.

[02:18:23.390 --> 02:18:24.930]
Well, we're not talking about physically capable

[02:18:24.930 --> 02:18:25.510]
of having it.

[02:18:25.750 --> 02:18:26.550]
When is it acceptable?

[02:18:26.550 --> 02:18:28.070]
In other words, the 40-year teachers are...

[02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.930]
That's a puberty, that's the fact.

[02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.710]
Yeah, okay, thank you.

[02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:30.630]
You know who that sounded like?

[02:18:30.710 --> 02:18:32.310]
That sounded like the same pedophile I call

[02:18:32.310 --> 02:18:34.090]
that somebody said he worked for that radio station

[02:18:34.090 --> 02:18:35.390]
with Adam, I want to say Radio Marti.

[02:18:35.710 --> 02:18:37.050]
We're getting that confirmed, by the way.

[02:18:37.530 --> 02:18:38.110]
Are we really?

[02:18:39.290 --> 02:18:40.550]
Yeah, you're not fooling anybody, okay?

[02:18:40.630 --> 02:18:41.530]
This, I'm pretty sure,

[02:18:41.650 --> 02:18:42.910]
although he didn't sound quite as mellow.

[02:18:43.010 --> 02:18:44.430]
He had not quite as good a phone line today,

[02:18:44.770 --> 02:18:46.590]
but that somewhat mellow sounding...

[02:18:46.590 --> 02:18:48.350]
I said, this guy sounds like a radio guy.

[02:18:48.430 --> 02:18:48.850]
Who is this?

[02:18:48.890 --> 02:18:49.210]
Remember that?

[02:18:50.170 --> 02:18:52.490]
And oh, yeah, he likes sitting in him all watching children.

[02:18:53.390 --> 02:18:54.470]
You know, I got news for a sir.

[02:18:54.850 --> 02:18:55.830]
Whether you believe this or not,

[02:18:55.830 --> 02:18:57.150]
there are a few things in the world

[02:18:57.150 --> 02:18:58.990]
that make me more nauseous than pedophiles

[02:18:58.990 --> 02:19:00.890]
than people who pray upon little children.

[02:19:01.230 --> 02:19:02.810]
Makes me nauseous.

[02:19:02.810 --> 02:19:03.950]
Makes me want to barf.

[02:19:05.250 --> 02:19:07.110]
And you happen to be one of them very obviously,

[02:19:07.210 --> 02:19:08.490]
and you could tell it from your previous call,

[02:19:08.610 --> 02:19:09.550]
and we do know who you are,

[02:19:09.790 --> 02:19:11.970]
and that just don't waste my time anymore, okay, Ansel?

[02:19:14.310 --> 02:19:16.750]
God, just pathetic, nauseating.

[02:19:18.630 --> 02:19:19.290]
Yeah, puberty.

[02:19:19.430 --> 02:19:21.070]
In other words, when I first hear a sprouts,

[02:19:21.070 --> 02:19:22.070]
that's okay, you're old enough.

[02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:23.710]
If it's old enough to pee, it's old enough for me.

[02:19:23.790 --> 02:19:24.630]
That's what you say.

[02:19:24.630 --> 02:19:26.230]
That wasn't the pedophile from before.

[02:19:26.410 --> 02:19:27.350]
Oh, it was the different pedophile.

[02:19:27.470 --> 02:19:27.910]
No, that's me.

[02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:31.550]
Are you serious?

[02:19:31.930 --> 02:19:33.230]
The pedophile from before called up

[02:19:33.230 --> 02:19:34.330]
and admitted he's a different pedophile.

[02:19:34.430 --> 02:19:35.990]
So we have a bunch of pedophiles out there.

[02:19:36.030 --> 02:19:36.150]
Good.

[02:19:36.390 --> 02:19:37.810]
Well, we're collecting numbers, by the way.

[02:19:38.090 --> 02:19:39.810]
So when we turn them over, we can do it all at one time.

[02:19:40.170 --> 02:19:40.790]
And as a matter of fact,

[02:19:41.010 --> 02:19:43.030]
since I'm in such a surly mood now about those dolphins,

[02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:44.530]
and tickets, when we turn those numbers in,

[02:19:44.670 --> 02:19:45.490]
I'll give you the name of that guy

[02:19:45.490 --> 02:19:47.610]
that used to work at I-95 before it became Zeta.

[02:19:48.990 --> 02:19:50.910]
Who, by the way, did I ever tell you that he got married?

[02:19:51.690 --> 02:19:53.210]
And the woman that he got married to,

[02:19:53.210 --> 02:19:56.670]
it's her second marriage, she's got a teenage son,

[02:19:57.890 --> 02:19:59.370]
a young teenage son.

[02:19:59.790 --> 02:20:01.530]
Of course, this was a few years ago, but nevertheless.

[02:20:03.530 --> 02:20:05.590]
Oh boy, it's just the beat goes on.

[02:20:05.690 --> 02:20:07.050]
Baby, here's a mobile in Davy.

[02:20:07.130 --> 02:20:07.290]
Hello.

[02:20:07.990 --> 02:20:08.890]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[02:20:09.070 --> 02:20:09.510]
Okay, sir.

[02:20:09.790 --> 02:20:11.610]
I think you'd be glad to hear that I helped

[02:20:11.610 --> 02:20:13.710]
you two breaks in the asshole bit.

[02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:16.010]
Are you 37 minutes and 19 seconds?

[02:20:16.110 --> 02:20:17.210]
This man deserves a medal.

[02:20:17.310 --> 02:20:18.230]
Oh, purple heart.

[02:20:18.410 --> 02:20:19.710]
Oh, black you serve.

[02:20:19.710 --> 02:20:20.530]
Black must you, yes?

[02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:21.890]
Plus six mosquito bites.

[02:20:22.090 --> 02:20:22.370]
All right.

[02:20:22.370 --> 02:20:22.890]
All right.

[02:20:23.150 --> 02:20:23.970]
Now, real quick.

[02:20:23.970 --> 02:20:25.630]
Yeah, I thought it started to get like Florida here now.

[02:20:26.590 --> 02:20:30.030]
Real quick, I was brought up basically in the 70s

[02:20:30.030 --> 02:20:31.470]
and my parents who's always told me

[02:20:32.330 --> 02:20:34.670]
to listen to the teachers are basically your parent

[02:20:34.670 --> 02:20:35.410]
when you're out at a home.

[02:20:35.970 --> 02:20:37.390]
Now I'm saying the same thing to my kids.

[02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:38.990]
Now I'm thinking of rethinking that

[02:20:39.490 --> 02:20:40.370]
because of the way they're acting

[02:20:40.370 --> 02:20:42.050]
and the way things are going on.

[02:20:42.090 --> 02:20:43.390]
I'm not talking about the sex clubs

[02:20:43.390 --> 02:20:44.330]
because that's their own time.

[02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:46.590]
But as far as it's almost like praying

[02:20:46.590 --> 02:20:47.890]
on little kids that you said before.

[02:20:48.470 --> 02:20:50.070]
So that's really, that's got me up at arms

[02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:51.370]
and I'm like looking at my daughter

[02:20:51.370 --> 02:20:52.750]
and I'm like, well, don't listen to anybody.

[02:20:52.750 --> 02:20:53.610]
Just do what you want to.

[02:20:53.610 --> 02:20:54.290]
How old is your daughter?

[02:20:54.530 --> 02:20:54.790]
Seven.

[02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.490]
Seven.

[02:20:55.870 --> 02:20:56.110]
Seven.

[02:20:56.290 --> 02:20:57.510]
Now you can imagine seven years

[02:20:57.510 --> 02:20:58.870]
when your daughter gets to be 14.

[02:20:59.450 --> 02:21:01.270]
And if there's a 40 year old science teacher

[02:21:01.270 --> 02:21:02.730]
saying her high school or middle school

[02:21:02.730 --> 02:21:04.050]
whatever she'll be at that time, middle school.

[02:21:04.590 --> 02:21:06.950]
And you find out that your daughter is having sex

[02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:07.870]
with this 40 year old man.

[02:21:07.970 --> 02:21:09.970]
I will guarantee you I know what your reaction will be.

[02:21:10.250 --> 02:21:13.770]
Well, I know that his tombstone will read that date.

[02:21:14.030 --> 02:21:14.790]
I don't know, like I'm saying.

[02:21:14.850 --> 02:21:15.210]
That's right.

[02:21:15.530 --> 02:21:17.790]
One quick thing about the police thing.

[02:21:19.230 --> 02:21:21.330]
I live up north, basically, open park.

[02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:24.570]
And a couple weeks ago, I had a cop stop a couple of kids

[02:21:24.570 --> 02:21:25.090]
on a bike.

[02:21:25.490 --> 02:21:26.830]
They were telling each other, you know,

[02:21:26.830 --> 02:21:28.250]
riding on the handlebars and stuff like that.

[02:21:28.690 --> 02:21:30.350]
Horrassed them, followed them down the street,

[02:21:30.470 --> 02:21:31.430]
make sure they didn't get back on.

[02:21:32.370 --> 02:21:34.170]
Couple of weeks later through these big storms,

[02:21:35.170 --> 02:21:36.810]
there was a, we had a flood

[02:21:36.810 --> 02:21:38.570]
to about up to your knees when you standing up.

[02:21:39.010 --> 02:21:40.630]
A lady was stuck in a car with the kid.

[02:21:41.470 --> 02:21:42.750]
Cops, your pastor.

[02:21:43.470 --> 02:21:44.310]
Not trying to help her.

[02:21:44.690 --> 02:21:45.930]
But when he came to the kids in a bike,

[02:21:45.930 --> 02:21:48.710]
they jump out and they tell them get off the bikes and go.

[02:21:49.490 --> 02:21:50.530]
And I love it.

[02:21:50.670 --> 02:21:52.150]
I got in a way.

[02:21:52.170 --> 02:21:53.370]
You know, I don't know what,

[02:21:53.370 --> 02:21:54.550]
well, maybe you think this this morning

[02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:56.170]
because I didn't really see any porkers on the road.

[02:21:56.310 --> 02:21:58.430]
But I was thinking about a conversation we had the other day

[02:21:58.430 --> 02:21:59.650]
about cops harassing the public,

[02:21:59.650 --> 02:22:02.650]
which I always talk about, to serve and protect.

[02:22:02.850 --> 02:22:04.510]
Those are the two words we're always hearing about.

[02:22:04.610 --> 02:22:06.390]
That's the definition of the job of a policeman

[02:22:06.390 --> 02:22:07.850]
to serve and protect.

[02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:11.510]
Not to harass, not to annoy, not to intrude,

[02:22:11.850 --> 02:22:14.410]
serve and protect, period and we're paying their salary.

[02:22:14.410 --> 02:22:16.310]
They would have been a service if they would have helped her.

[02:22:17.170 --> 02:22:18.470]
And one more thing before I go now.

[02:22:18.730 --> 02:22:19.050]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:20.030]
I love you, man.

[02:22:20.250 --> 02:22:20.470]
OK.

[02:22:21.210 --> 02:22:21.410]
Sure.

[02:22:21.790 --> 02:22:21.930]
Bye.

[02:22:23.570 --> 02:22:24.310]
Well, there's Madonna.

[02:22:24.590 --> 02:22:25.390]
It's a tentacle.

[02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:25.750]
Slut.

[02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:28.550]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60.

[02:22:28.690 --> 02:22:29.310]
No, I don't like her.

[02:22:29.370 --> 02:22:30.290]
I do like that song, though.

[02:22:30.350 --> 02:22:32.710]
I do like maybe, and it's not just because of Austin Powers.

[02:22:32.930 --> 02:22:33.610]
I like the song.

[02:22:33.630 --> 02:22:34.190]
It's a good song.

[02:22:35.130 --> 02:22:35.830]
What does it call?

[02:22:36.170 --> 02:22:37.190]
Stranger, beautiful, stranger.

[02:22:38.090 --> 02:22:40.450]
Well, even I see I try to block those things out of my mind.

[02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:41.210]
Like fat boys.

[02:22:41.210 --> 02:22:42.290]
You hear with the tickets yet, by the way?

[02:22:42.290 --> 02:22:42.770]
Oh, no.

[02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:46.330]
See, if I find out that he's been yanking my chain again

[02:22:46.330 --> 02:22:47.990]
about that, and not that it's a big deal,

[02:22:47.990 --> 02:22:50.650]
I don't owe this porter at the airport any tickets

[02:22:50.650 --> 02:22:51.890]
around me, but he's a nice guy.

[02:22:51.890 --> 02:22:52.890]
I always have a chat with him.

[02:22:52.890 --> 02:22:53.750]
He's always very nice to me.

[02:22:54.310 --> 02:22:55.770]
And why the hell not?

[02:22:56.170 --> 02:22:57.130]
Do something nice for somebody.

[02:22:58.650 --> 02:23:00.870]
And if you can't do it, then don't, oh, yeah, no problem,

[02:23:01.010 --> 02:23:01.130]
pal.

[02:23:01.130 --> 02:23:02.030]
I'm going to see you at that.

[02:23:02.170 --> 02:23:03.090]
This was on Monday.

[02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:03.930]
Today is Thursday.

[02:23:03.990 --> 02:23:05.570]
It's getting perilously closer to the end of the week.

[02:23:05.770 --> 02:23:06.970]
I said, I need it by Friday.

[02:23:07.310 --> 02:23:08.810]
I want them by Friday.

[02:23:10.330 --> 02:23:12.690]
Have we seen Heidner here at this fat cow today?

[02:23:13.150 --> 02:23:13.250]
No.

[02:23:13.330 --> 02:23:13.330]

[02:23:13.870 --> 02:23:15.050]
Maybe he's over in Halea.

[02:23:16.010 --> 02:23:16.690]
Here's Davy.

[02:23:16.770 --> 02:23:16.930]
Hello.

[02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:18.890]
Greetings, Lord Rogers.

[02:23:19.110 --> 02:23:19.430]
Yes, sir.

[02:23:20.090 --> 02:23:22.150]
Did you see this thing on the news the other day

[02:23:22.150 --> 02:23:25.490]
about there was a tree somewhere in South Florida.

[02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:27.810]
I remember the city, but some of the trees in South Florida?

[02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:29.730]
Yeah, and some bark fell off of it.

[02:23:29.850 --> 02:23:32.110]
And some lady thought that it was the image

[02:23:32.110 --> 02:23:33.170]
of the Virgin Mary.

[02:23:33.250 --> 02:23:33.690]
All right.

[02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:34.310]
All right.

[02:23:34.850 --> 02:23:37.250]
Everyone comes up with candles and cards.

[02:23:37.250 --> 02:23:38.670]
Start lighting it.

[02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:40.890]
There's hundreds of people there praying to the tree.

[02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:42.130]
All right.

[02:23:42.570 --> 02:23:44.170]
Now, then they have this one lady.

[02:23:44.290 --> 02:23:44.650]
Oh, my God.

[02:23:45.370 --> 02:23:46.430]
That's why I love that.

[02:23:46.570 --> 02:23:48.370]
Then they have this one lady who comes.

[02:23:48.590 --> 02:23:51.870]
She goes, I don't believe in, I don't go to church

[02:23:51.870 --> 02:23:54.070]
or believe in God, but I believe in this.

[02:23:54.990 --> 02:23:55.810]
It was ridiculous.

[02:23:56.250 --> 02:23:57.370]
I could even believe it.

[02:23:57.430 --> 02:23:58.510]
Doug and she under, oh, that's right.

[02:23:58.550 --> 02:24:01.570]
It was the 18th, it was five days after she appeared at Ramosa Lopez's house

[02:24:01.570 --> 02:24:02.030]
in Hollywood.

[02:24:02.350 --> 02:24:02.970]
She's everywhere.

[02:24:03.850 --> 02:24:05.330]
Oh, hey, can I get a request?

[02:24:05.570 --> 02:24:05.910]
Yes, sir.

[02:24:06.690 --> 02:24:09.010]
Buffalo Bill, lotion in the basket for my brother

[02:24:09.010 --> 02:24:10.770]
who's down visiting from New Jersey.

[02:24:11.090 --> 02:24:11.790]
OK, you got it.

[02:24:11.810 --> 02:24:12.030]
Thanks.

[02:24:12.210 --> 02:24:12.870]
Have a great day, son.

[02:24:13.230 --> 02:24:14.930]
Watch out and say hi to Virgin Mary for us.

[02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:16.670]
All right, the Virgin Mary is hanging out in town.

[02:24:17.210 --> 02:24:18.730]
I think she's barking up the wrong tree myself.

[02:24:20.930 --> 02:24:21.650]
This is Debbie.

[02:24:21.970 --> 02:24:22.150]
This is Debbie.

[02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:22.550]
Hello, Debbie.

[02:24:23.050 --> 02:24:25.250]
I'm here to see and get some operations done.

[02:24:25.730 --> 02:24:26.050]
OK.

[02:24:26.270 --> 02:24:28.390]
And some body contouring and some liposuction.

[02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:31.150]
And there was wondering if there's some tummy tuck.

[02:24:31.790 --> 02:24:34.110]
And the lip augmentation cosmetic compresses

[02:24:34.110 --> 02:24:36.390]
the face gift to all of these things.

[02:24:36.890 --> 02:24:37.990]
And I was wondering.

[02:24:38.350 --> 02:24:39.170]
What would you like to start with?

[02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:41.650]
Well, I need to get everything done.

[02:24:41.850 --> 02:24:43.770]
Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed

[02:24:43.770 --> 02:24:46.070]
is my thing.

[02:24:46.690 --> 02:24:47.630]
OK, we don't do that.

years that got between two and four thirty we apologize but in any rate so

[02:26:35.810 --> 02:26:38.810]
fat boy calls up George during the uh... while we were listening to that

[02:26:38.810 --> 02:26:42.410]
and tells him about a beat by the boot but about the end of the day a repair he

[02:26:42.410 --> 02:26:44.110]
did this in this one did that and he don't have

[02:26:44.110 --> 02:26:47.730]
see i think if i take back i never want to be an indian gebra i never do that but

[02:26:47.730 --> 02:26:50.450]
in this case i would make an exception because if i took back the bills

[02:26:50.450 --> 02:26:53.050]
often to get in the parking pass that would sell two problems

[02:26:53.450 --> 02:26:56.070]
number one would correct the mistake that i made by giving them to in the first

[02:26:56.070 --> 02:26:59.210]
place and that would provide me with tickets to the parking pass to give to a guy

[02:26:59.210 --> 02:27:03.030]
who's a good guy that i promise them to that would solve a lot of problems

[02:27:03.030 --> 02:27:05.530]
that are great seats to by the way club seats my seat

[02:27:07.710 --> 02:27:10.590]

doing what they do best feeding you a bullcraft line this man has gotten more

[02:27:14.190 --> 02:27:17.210]
crap that's why he's so big i don't think it's just the food you know

[02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:21.190]
i think that you want walking around in your then full of crap i think that it

[02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:21.890]

[02:27:22.670 --> 02:27:24.190]
and believe me it's shown

[02:27:24.890 --> 02:27:29.390]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eight tnt wireless line

[02:27:29.390 --> 02:27:30.930]
here's a mobile in del Rey hello

[02:27:31.470 --> 02:27:32.550]
you yes sir

[02:27:33.070 --> 02:27:35.730]
i'm going to police officer i thought i'd give you a call to hear in that

[02:27:35.730 --> 02:27:39.310]
smoke that just called you a second ago you know you see our job is to serve

[02:27:39.310 --> 02:27:43.110]
and protect which are absolutely right our job is also to enforce the law

[02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:47.150]
and if that guy and half a brain and it's had realized that when we stop these

[02:27:47.150 --> 02:27:50.970]
kids that are told on our bicycles we use those small statutes small

[02:27:50.970 --> 02:27:54.550]
reasons like that to stop and you can check kids out and if you had any

[02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:57.390]
brains that i realize that these are the kids that are doing burglaries and

[02:27:57.390 --> 02:28:00.390]
robberies and things of that nature i can't tell you how many times i've

[02:28:00.390 --> 02:28:03.810]
pulled guns and dope and god knows what else all these kids yeah and it all

[02:28:03.810 --> 02:28:07.130]
starts out with a simple thing like so on the bicycle or something like that

[02:28:07.130 --> 02:28:11.670]
you know and uh... it's ashamed it you know comments like that just

[02:28:11.670 --> 02:28:14.670]
perpetuate this resentment towards long force well there is a lot of

[02:28:14.670 --> 02:28:17.930]
reason because people get tired of the radar traps and the speed traps in the

[02:28:17.930 --> 02:28:21.350]
uh... and the sex club braids and all this other crap you're right as far as

[02:28:21.350 --> 02:28:23.370]
a prostitution tonight agree with you as far as that but

[02:28:23.930 --> 02:28:27.110]

now i don't know if you're familiar with that excited that intersection

[02:28:40.650 --> 02:28:45.430]
and i can't rely very heavily trafficked okay uh... travel and this is about five

[02:28:45.430 --> 02:28:48.870]
forty five and a little rush hour traffic this happens every week in last

[02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:49.770]
night i counted

[02:28:49.770 --> 02:28:50.730]

[02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:11.290]
you can call the epidemic of this down here

you can call the chief of the agency request our enforcement of the

[02:29:14.750 --> 02:29:15.610]
legal intersection but

[02:29:16.230 --> 02:29:17.450]

i we all appreciate good cops but uh... you know there are you have to admit

[02:29:44.270 --> 02:29:47.070]
their plan it's a show and i'm sure you agree with this that there's more

[02:29:47.070 --> 02:29:50.110]
integrity and less criminal activity from police officers in the clergy

[02:29:50.550 --> 02:29:51.710]
well done back

[02:29:51.710 --> 02:29:54.030]

[02:30:03.190 --> 02:30:06.450]
do something before a whole bunch of people get killed up there it's only a

[02:30:06.450 --> 02:30:10.370]
miracle we're talking six seven eight people just come flying around there

[02:30:10.370 --> 02:30:12.290]
long after the light is turned red

[02:30:12.290 --> 02:30:13.750]
the left turn light

[02:30:14.370 --> 02:30:17.050]
and you know that because you're like to go straight ahead is green

[02:30:17.050 --> 02:30:19.990]
so that they're rocket scientists to figure out that they're running the god

[02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.510]
damn light

[02:30:20.510 --> 02:30:23.690]
it's everywhere it's not just there but that's one of the worst you have never

[02:30:23.690 --> 02:30:25.430]
they just come flying around there

[02:30:25.430 --> 02:30:28.470]
and god forbid that you should know be sitting there waiting to make your turn

[02:30:28.930 --> 02:30:32.710]
i forget about turn our right turn on red i'm talking about making a turn on

[02:30:32.710 --> 02:30:33.410]
a green light

[02:30:33.930 --> 02:30:35.270]
because they'll kill your ass

[02:30:35.830 --> 02:30:38.450]
speaking of popular park by the way and it's a good thing i read the program

[02:30:38.450 --> 02:30:41.210]
and listen carefully because david horrors he tell me what's going on over

[02:30:41.210 --> 02:30:44.690]
there no carol how does he tell me no salesperson has got his account

[02:30:44.690 --> 02:30:46.750]
no heinous no penis whatever's name is

[02:30:48.310 --> 02:30:51.410]
so anyway popular park last night they announced that the this weekend we got

[02:30:51.410 --> 02:30:53.970]
live racing proddy and setter day and then we have no more live racing

[02:30:53.970 --> 02:30:56.510]
until september third we got simul casting every day monday through

[02:30:56.510 --> 02:30:59.230]
saturday but they're gonna take a couple weeks off from live racing and after

[02:30:59.230 --> 02:31:01.130]
what i saw last night by the way not a bad idea

[02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:04.850]
but anyway so here's the deal we got simul casting today being the

[02:31:04.850 --> 02:31:07.610]
thursday freehold at one o'clock started half hour ago

[02:31:07.610 --> 02:31:10.690]
buffalo raceway one fifteen tonight's i would have downed the high-line

[02:31:10.690 --> 02:31:13.870]
rosecroft meadows hazel park would buy nyankers who's your balmerl

[02:31:13.870 --> 02:31:16.910]
so you got plenty of action and plenty of reasoning out to pop it up park monday

[02:31:16.910 --> 02:31:19.690]
through saturday but don't forget live racing resumes on friday

[02:31:19.690 --> 02:31:22.810]

were over there, if I needed to pair tickets for the dolphins or whatever it would be, whether

[02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:25.030]
it was for me or somebody else or grandma Moses, all you'd have to do was just mention it.

[02:33:25.030 --> 02:33:29.750]
And before I lock Gary Mills or Jeff Clark or Rick Alpo or somebody, sales hall would

[02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:30.730]
come by, hey, here you go.

[02:33:30.950 --> 02:33:32.230]
Here's a pair of tickets parking pass.

[02:33:32.830 --> 02:33:36.770]
You know, does that happen here?

[02:33:37.130 --> 02:33:37.310]
No.

[02:33:37.610 --> 02:33:42.770]
And of course at IOD they also been charged for station paraphernalia like caps and t-shirts

[02:33:42.770 --> 02:33:43.590]
and stuff like that.

[02:33:44.730 --> 02:33:46.290]
You hear the price tag on those right?

[02:33:46.550 --> 02:33:46.690]
No.

[02:33:47.350 --> 02:33:48.010]
Those shirts?

[02:33:49.530 --> 02:33:50.390]
You'll never guess.

[02:33:51.330 --> 02:33:51.950]
25 bucks.

[02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.710]
E.

[02:33:53.350 --> 02:33:53.790]
30.

[02:33:53.790 --> 02:33:55.450]
30 dollars.

[02:33:56.570 --> 02:33:58.670]
For that, for a piece of crap, you I'm sure?

[02:34:01.590 --> 02:34:05.950]
Shirts and caps and they're charging the hired hands here to buy their own promotional

[02:34:05.950 --> 02:34:06.290]
stuff.

[02:34:06.630 --> 02:34:08.030]
That's how cheap the beesleaves are.

[02:34:09.870 --> 02:34:11.170]
It's just unconsumably.

[02:34:11.330 --> 02:34:11.730]
It's unbelievable.

[02:34:12.870 --> 02:34:13.710]
Why do I hear the facts?

[02:34:13.910 --> 02:34:17.870]
Because I like to give all sides of all stories from Dr. Dean Del on the internet about

[02:34:17.870 --> 02:34:19.030]
the Asperer-Tame Hoax.

[02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:20.610]
And I don't know.

[02:34:20.910 --> 02:34:22.450]
I would like to believe this.

[02:34:22.930 --> 02:34:26.710]
It says, I'd like to say congratulations to Time Magazine for sending the records straight

[02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:28.270]
on the artificial sweetener Asperer-Tame.

[02:34:28.450 --> 02:34:30.430]
This is from way back in February this year, by the way.

[02:34:30.950 --> 02:34:34.110]
As you may know, there's been a deluge of inaccurate information being said over the

[02:34:34.110 --> 02:34:35.150]
internet about this sweetener.

[02:34:35.510 --> 02:34:39.010]
In a full page story, Timed the Bunked the email attack on Asperer-Tame by using good

[02:34:39.010 --> 02:34:42.890]
old investigative journalism, the email barrage against Asperer-Tame makes various negative

[02:34:42.890 --> 02:34:44.670]
claims and the timewriter checked each one out.

[02:34:44.950 --> 02:34:48.110]
What she discovered was they were indeed unsubstantiated or downright bogus.

[02:34:48.650 --> 02:34:52.090]
For example, writer Christina German looked into one claim that Asperer-Tame leads to

[02:34:52.090 --> 02:34:55.330]
methanol toxicity and her conclusion was not even close.

[02:34:55.570 --> 02:34:59.450]
She notes that there's four times as much methanol in a glass of tomato juice that there

[02:34:59.450 --> 02:35:01.370]
is a can of Asperer-Tame sweet and soda.

[02:35:01.710 --> 02:35:03.830]
And our bodies have no trouble handling such a small amount.

[02:35:05.550 --> 02:35:09.330]
And it goes on and on and on and says, beware any of the crappy read on the internet to

[02:35:09.330 --> 02:35:10.590]
which I would say am into that.

[02:35:11.670 --> 02:35:15.730]
All of Loneolos' ridiculous stories about the proctor and gamble and the guests that

[02:35:15.730 --> 02:35:17.030]
supposedly were on with Sally Jessie.

[02:35:17.450 --> 02:35:21.630]
I mean, there are more lies and more distorts that involve bulk, more bullcrap that they

[02:35:21.630 --> 02:35:23.330]
would be a drug up on the internet.

[02:35:23.710 --> 02:35:24.150]
Dreadjup?

[02:35:25.950 --> 02:35:28.790]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:35:30.830 --> 02:35:31.650]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:35:31.870 --> 02:35:31.990]
Hello.

[02:35:34.730 --> 02:35:35.170]
Hollywood.

[02:35:36.050 --> 02:35:36.490]
Neil.

[02:35:36.730 --> 02:35:37.030]
Yes, sir.

[02:35:37.170 --> 02:35:37.670]
How are you today?

[02:35:37.930 --> 02:35:38.150]
Okay.

[02:35:38.490 --> 02:35:38.650]
Good.

[02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:41.570]
I'm back at the steal at the woman who had sex with a minor.

[02:35:42.090 --> 02:35:45.090]
Although there was drugs involved, I definitely disapprove of that.

[02:35:45.390 --> 02:35:48.110]
However, I'm not, maybe I'm mistaken.

[02:35:48.330 --> 02:35:48.710]
I'm not sure.

[02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:53.830]
Maybe you can tell me in the state of Florida is it not legal for someone to marry a minor?

[02:35:56.190 --> 02:35:56.810]
I don't know.

[02:35:56.970 --> 02:35:57.810]
I really don't know about that.

[02:35:58.410 --> 02:35:59.270]
I'm sure it must be.

[02:35:59.550 --> 02:36:01.490]
I mean, there are people under 17 who get married.

[02:36:02.090 --> 02:36:04.130]
Yeah, well, that kind of sets a double standard.

[02:36:04.390 --> 02:36:06.830]
I know you can't tell me that only folks that are marrying minors.

[02:36:06.830 --> 02:36:08.630]
I can't say there's a lot of them, but people that do it.

[02:36:08.790 --> 02:36:09.150]
I'm not having sex now.

[02:36:09.150 --> 02:36:10.290]
They're just not having sex now.

[02:36:11.010 --> 02:36:11.250]
Not a lot.

[02:36:11.250 --> 02:36:12.710]
But that's way until the states is okay.

[02:36:12.770 --> 02:36:13.730]
Now you can go ahead and do it.

[02:36:14.170 --> 02:36:17.370]
They set their self up for a life of misery by being married to someone first.

[02:36:17.370 --> 02:36:18.810]
Then you're allowed to have sex with a minor.

[02:36:19.130 --> 02:36:19.130]

[02:36:20.430 --> 02:36:21.150]
All right.

[02:36:21.370 --> 02:36:22.130]
Well, that's all I had.

[02:36:22.270 --> 02:36:23.390]
Can I call somebody a doufex?

[02:36:23.470 --> 02:36:23.790]
Yes, sir.

[02:36:24.090 --> 02:36:27.010]
Brandon, on your way to West Palm, you are a major doufex.

[02:36:27.150 --> 02:36:27.330]
Okay.

[02:36:27.710 --> 02:36:28.090]
Take care.

[02:36:30.770 --> 02:36:32.530]
56670560.560 on the AT&T line.

[02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:34.090]
Their audience is all over the place on this.

[02:36:34.210 --> 02:36:37.710]
I think it's almost the unanimous we agree on the drugs and the cocaine and the acid and

[02:36:37.710 --> 02:36:39.330]
buy on the car and all of these things.

[02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:43.410]
But on the sex part, there's a tremendous ambiguity here, which it's kind of surprising to

[02:36:43.410 --> 02:36:46.870]
me because I think that when you're reading about a 40-year-old woman having sex with a 14-year-old

[02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:50.250]
boy, especially in this case, who are being the teacher of the class and also shackling

[02:36:50.250 --> 02:36:54.210]
up a bunch of kids, underage kids in her condo, that people will be just screaming bloody

[02:36:54.210 --> 02:36:54.950]
murder, but they're not.

[02:36:55.670 --> 02:36:59.250]
However, it's also been unanimous that if it was a girl who was the 14-year-old and if

[02:36:59.250 --> 02:37:02.690]
it was their daughter, that they'd be no person's assed.

[02:37:05.890 --> 02:37:08.130]
56670560.560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:37:08.210 --> 02:37:09.070]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[02:37:09.250 --> 02:37:09.390]
Hello?

[02:37:10.590 --> 02:37:11.270]
Neil, how's it going?

[02:37:11.470 --> 02:37:11.950]
Pretty good, sir.

[02:37:12.450 --> 02:37:15.690]
Listen, I had a call in the address that I told my ass cop that was looking through life

[02:37:15.690 --> 02:37:17.210]
in his rose-colored glasses there.

[02:37:17.370 --> 02:37:18.190]
I called you a few minutes ago.

[02:37:18.350 --> 02:37:19.090]
I mean, give me a break.

[02:37:19.210 --> 02:37:20.290]
Even the example he gave.

[02:37:20.590 --> 02:37:21.110]
Oh, my God.

[02:37:21.330 --> 02:37:22.870]
Well, maybe before you go on, let me give you the good news.

[02:37:23.230 --> 02:37:27.250]
I did my little pitch and a trooper from up there in that Pompato beach area called George

[02:37:27.250 --> 02:37:29.090]
and he's going to take it into his own hands.

[02:37:29.090 --> 02:37:32.190]
They're going to start patrolling that power line Atlantic and watch him for these assholes

[02:37:32.190 --> 02:37:32.630]
running light.

[02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:33.270]
But then we go ahead.

[02:37:33.630 --> 02:37:34.170]
That's fine.

[02:37:34.490 --> 02:37:34.970]
That's fine.

[02:37:35.090 --> 02:37:39.410]
If they're actually doing legitimate things that are actually creating a safer environment

[02:37:39.410 --> 02:37:40.590]
for us to live in, that's fine.

[02:37:40.750 --> 02:37:40.890]
Right.

[02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.610]
It's a fact.

[02:37:42.470 --> 02:37:43.450]
It's a fact.

[02:37:43.450 --> 02:37:45.410]
The fact of the matter is he carries all these examples.

[02:37:45.950 --> 02:37:49.270]
The one I really impressed me was the fact that, oh, we have higher moral standards than

[02:37:49.270 --> 02:37:49.550]
the clergy.

[02:37:49.850 --> 02:37:50.950]
That's pretty impressive, obviously.

[02:37:51.870 --> 02:37:53.030]
Yeah, that's a pretty good example.

[02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:53.030]

[02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:54.250]
Yeah, that's a pretty good example.

[02:37:54.250 --> 02:37:55.790]
He should have said radio salespeople.

[02:37:55.930 --> 02:37:56.390]
I would have been good.

[02:37:56.950 --> 02:37:59.350]
I got to give you a quick story.

[02:37:59.770 --> 02:38:00.850]
And this is the God's on.

[02:38:00.990 --> 02:38:01.770]
Well, whatever.

[02:38:02.030 --> 02:38:02.550]
Whoever's honest.

[02:38:03.870 --> 02:38:07.090]
The fact of the matter is I have some good friends of mine who happen to be a little

[02:38:07.090 --> 02:38:08.370]
darker in complexion than myself.

[02:38:08.550 --> 02:38:13.170]
And I can't tell you how many more times, way more than ten, let's say.

[02:38:13.170 --> 02:38:17.870]
Where I've ridden with him and he has been stared at, he has been pulled over, he has

[02:38:17.870 --> 02:38:18.930]
been harassed.

[02:38:19.010 --> 02:38:20.930]
Just for the fact that, yeah, he makes a pretty good income.

[02:38:21.230 --> 02:38:24.490]
He drives a high dollar vehicle and it's the same old stereotype.

[02:38:24.710 --> 02:38:29.450]
And I understand there, because I'm just kidding.

[02:38:29.930 --> 02:38:30.390]
I'm just kidding.

[02:38:30.710 --> 02:38:32.710]
If you did, I mean, it's pretty nice ride to ride around anyway.

[02:38:32.950 --> 02:38:33.150]
But no.

[02:38:33.610 --> 02:38:34.570]
He's a legit guy.

[02:38:34.750 --> 02:38:36.830]
Him and his wife are both CPAs and they're real good living.

[02:38:37.310 --> 02:38:41.210]
Now, I understand that the majority, it's a delight.

[02:38:41.210 --> 02:38:44.730]
I mean, the majority, I hate to say this, but I mean, obviously the majority of what

[02:38:44.730 --> 02:38:48.290]
they deal with is probably your minorities and so forth.

[02:38:48.630 --> 02:38:51.030]
But you can't carry that stereotype through everyone.

[02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:52.350]
You've got to give him a chance at least.

[02:38:52.730 --> 02:38:57.710]
And this guy doesn't realize that I also have friends that are cops that, they're friends

[02:38:57.710 --> 02:39:01.830]
of mine, but they still discuss me at times because I listen to the way they talk and I

[02:39:01.830 --> 02:39:02.810]
listen to the way they carry out.

[02:39:02.810 --> 02:39:04.930]
Well, I understand where the guy's coming from.

[02:39:05.070 --> 02:39:08.870]
He's a cop and evidently he's conscientious and he's, you know, he's very trying very

[02:39:08.870 --> 02:39:09.850]
hard to do good job in there.

[02:39:09.850 --> 02:39:16.290]
He's like, however, for a cop and stop flow to be talking about the high standards of

[02:39:16.850 --> 02:39:20.670]
the law enforcement people, in this area, I mean, people are just going to be peeing in

[02:39:20.670 --> 02:39:24.410]
their pants laughing because there is a day goes by that we don't have another horrendous

[02:39:24.410 --> 02:39:25.610]
scandal story going on here.

[02:39:25.690 --> 02:39:27.090]
It's a complete joke and let me ask you this.

[02:39:27.470 --> 02:39:31.330]
You know, if you had a certain problem with a certain type of person, be it any type

[02:39:31.330 --> 02:39:32.150]
of person, okay?

[02:39:32.510 --> 02:39:35.330]
What's your opinion going to be about that group people later on in life when you experience

[02:39:35.330 --> 02:39:35.530]
it?

[02:39:35.970 --> 02:39:37.070]
It's going to be noisy, right?

[02:39:37.470 --> 02:39:38.250]
Well, guess what?

[02:39:38.410 --> 02:39:42.630]
People have a lousy attitude towards cops for the most part and have a little respect for

[02:39:42.630 --> 02:39:45.170]
the fact that there's no respect shown that they're prior in their life.

[02:39:45.330 --> 02:39:45.410]
Right.

[02:39:45.730 --> 02:39:46.010]
That's right.

[02:39:46.530 --> 02:39:48.450]
And people don't want to be harassed.

[02:39:48.450 --> 02:39:51.430]
They don't want to feel like we're peeing somebody's salary to hassle us.

[02:39:51.550 --> 02:39:52.890]
That's not what we're peeing people to do.

[02:39:53.330 --> 02:39:53.490]
Right.

[02:39:53.690 --> 02:39:56.730]
I mean, if I'm doing something wrong and you straighten me out fine, I have no problem

[02:39:56.730 --> 02:39:56.970]
with you.

[02:39:57.190 --> 02:40:01.230]
But if I'm just, I mean, it's unbelievable, the double standard, which, I mean, even

[02:40:01.230 --> 02:40:03.990]
in normal life, most of the most part, the biggest hypocrites I've ever seen in my

[02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:04.230]
life.

[02:40:04.770 --> 02:40:06.850]
So, anyway, I'll pass the word on.

[02:40:07.150 --> 02:40:07.590]
I had a vent.

[02:40:07.750 --> 02:40:08.170]
Okay, cool.

[02:40:08.550 --> 02:40:08.890]
Okay.

[02:40:09.550 --> 02:40:13.350]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:40:13.490 --> 02:40:16.890]
Our poll question today is, who do you trust more, your neighborhood cop or your local

[02:40:16.890 --> 02:40:17.190]
priest?

[02:40:17.190 --> 02:40:18.870]
Liberty, Paris, Cuba.

[02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:20.410]
Liberty, Paris, Cuba.

[02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:34.190]
Listen to the sound of God's wrongfully playing.

[02:40:34.730 --> 02:40:37.230]
Oh, I'm moving into the feast.

[02:40:37.610 --> 02:40:37.830]
Yeah.

[02:40:38.810 --> 02:40:45.350]
You think of open millionaire like JFK, could afford a better playing.

[02:40:45.770 --> 02:40:46.010]
Yeah.

[02:40:46.010 --> 02:40:46.170]
I'm going to get a better performance.

[02:40:47.470 --> 02:40:50.810]
JFK has got time for a little phone.

[02:40:51.210 --> 02:40:54.470]
A five-year-old's that cheap and crappy twins that blow.

[02:40:55.230 --> 02:40:58.770]
A Friday that my head's about to be over in the air.

[02:41:02.890 --> 02:41:06.810]
Now, head to the only one that lets the life he say.

[02:41:07.430 --> 02:41:09.950]
From what they call the Kennedy curse.

[02:41:11.050 --> 02:41:14.990]
If Doris he killed Gellin for the life she's saved.

[02:41:15.450 --> 02:41:18.190]
She's up it's only gonna get worse.

[02:41:19.470 --> 02:41:21.830]
This is the smoothest town in Georgia.

[02:41:22.150 --> 02:41:23.350]
It's a high state.

[02:41:24.550 --> 02:41:25.350]
But it's water.

[02:41:25.650 --> 02:41:26.410]
It's water.

[02:41:26.890 --> 02:41:27.350]
It's water.

[02:41:27.350 --> 02:41:27.910]
It's a state.

[02:41:28.510 --> 02:41:29.270]
It's a town.

[02:41:29.650 --> 02:41:29.950]
It's a state.

[02:41:32.290 --> 02:41:32.910]
It's water.

[02:41:33.730 --> 02:41:33.910]
It's water.

[02:41:34.310 --> 02:41:35.330]
Oh, it don't play much.

[02:41:35.530 --> 02:41:36.450]
It's six-footer Brian.

[02:41:36.590 --> 02:41:38.770]
145 at 5, 60 WQAM.

[02:41:38.890 --> 02:41:39.510]
Although we do agree.

[02:41:39.510 --> 02:41:43.890]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:41:44.550 --> 02:41:45.210]
Here's D'Areal.

[02:41:45.450 --> 02:41:45.530]
Hello.

[02:41:46.290 --> 02:41:46.950]
A meal.

[02:41:47.190 --> 02:41:47.490]
Yes, sir.

[02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:49.290]
Good afternoon, señorito Niel.

[02:41:49.450 --> 02:41:49.990]
And back to you.

[02:41:50.130 --> 02:41:50.550]
Thank you.

[02:41:51.090 --> 02:41:51.370]
Senorito.

[02:41:51.710 --> 02:41:52.630]
No, I said señorito.

[02:41:52.890 --> 02:41:53.330]
Senorito?

[02:41:53.670 --> 02:41:53.850]
Yes.

[02:41:54.190 --> 02:41:54.930]
I don't know what that is.

[02:41:55.230 --> 02:41:55.950]
Virgin Meals.

[02:41:56.530 --> 02:41:56.790]
Oh.

[02:41:57.230 --> 02:41:58.170]
Okay, whatever you say.

[02:41:58.390 --> 02:42:01.650]
It's like senior but you know like with feeling with care.

[02:42:01.870 --> 02:42:03.230]
With the Rock-Lonus, okay.

[02:42:03.230 --> 02:42:03.430]
Right.

[02:42:04.190 --> 02:42:09.250]
The intersection of 36th Street, Northwest, 87th Avenue here in D'Areal.

[02:42:09.510 --> 02:42:09.630]
Yes.

[02:42:09.710 --> 02:42:13.310]
We need two Metro-day cops to monitor that intersection.

[02:42:13.490 --> 02:42:15.030]
So I'm putting a plea out in the air right now.

[02:42:15.110 --> 02:42:15.370]
Okay.

[02:42:16.030 --> 02:42:21.290]
I'm going to lunch now at 12 o'clock and I'm like the fourth person waiting to go straight

[02:42:21.910 --> 02:42:27.570]
through that intersection and sure enough, six other cars are just going and going after the

[02:42:27.570 --> 02:42:28.930]
after we got the green.

[02:42:29.090 --> 02:42:30.590]
And then you can't make the green light.

[02:42:31.110 --> 02:42:31.390]
Right.

[02:42:31.390 --> 02:42:31.430]
Right.

[02:42:31.430 --> 02:42:31.890]
I mean sometimes.

[02:42:32.210 --> 02:42:35.850]
Well that to me is not only are these people in danger and are they like attempting murder

[02:42:35.850 --> 02:42:40.330]
by doing that and breaking law in a very dangerous way but they also prevent the traffic

[02:42:40.330 --> 02:42:41.730]
from moving when they have the green light.

[02:42:41.990 --> 02:42:42.030]
Right.

[02:42:42.130 --> 02:42:46.090]
So if you got for better like fifth or sixth in line, they haven't got a Chinaman chance

[02:42:46.090 --> 02:42:48.970]
to make it a two light because by the time you get up there now it's back there right

[02:42:48.970 --> 02:42:49.210]
again.

[02:42:49.350 --> 02:42:49.690]
That's right.

[02:42:49.830 --> 02:42:56.590]
I'm the fourth person waiting to go straight and the people in the front are actually waiting

[02:42:57.230 --> 02:42:59.590]
for these people to clear and then they will go.

[02:42:59.590 --> 02:42:59.810]
Right.

[02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:04.950]
You know, but what I do is when I'm the first one in the front and I get the green, I start

[02:43:04.950 --> 02:43:09.930]
to move forward but people still, you know, they look at me like, hey, what are you doing?

[02:43:10.230 --> 02:43:10.790]
You're going to go.

[02:43:10.950 --> 02:43:12.810]
You got a lot of nerve going on a green light.

[02:43:12.970 --> 02:43:13.790]
You know what they end up doing?

[02:43:13.810 --> 02:43:18.670]
They end up going around me and then going around the other person that's waiting and the opposite

[02:43:18.670 --> 02:43:20.330]
side turning left.

[02:43:20.530 --> 02:43:23.430]
So they're like making an S turn around me.

[02:43:23.650 --> 02:43:23.830]
Yeah.

[02:43:24.010 --> 02:43:26.090]
I think they love the other three letters out of the S.

[02:43:26.610 --> 02:43:27.010]
Yeah.

[02:43:27.010 --> 02:43:27.110]
Yeah.

[02:43:27.310 --> 02:43:27.630]
Yeah.

[02:43:28.470 --> 02:43:29.050]
Shameless requests.

[02:43:29.230 --> 02:43:29.730]
Yes sir.

[02:43:29.750 --> 02:43:31.050]
Haven't heard this one in a long time.

[02:43:32.070 --> 02:43:32.710]
Tiny hooters.

[02:43:33.190 --> 02:43:33.510]
Okay.

[02:43:33.710 --> 02:43:33.950]
Please.

[02:43:34.130 --> 02:43:34.530]
Thank you.

[02:43:34.610 --> 02:43:34.870]
Yeah.

[02:43:35.070 --> 02:43:35.330]
Bye bye.

[02:43:35.530 --> 02:43:36.310]
Is that in here by the way?

[02:43:38.010 --> 02:43:39.050]
Is tiny hooters in here?

[02:43:41.070 --> 02:43:41.390]
Okay.

[02:43:41.510 --> 02:43:41.830]
It's coming up.

[02:43:42.250 --> 02:43:42.530]
Okay.

[02:43:42.670 --> 02:43:42.950]
Five-set.

[02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:43.310]
Look at that.

[02:43:43.310 --> 02:43:46.850]
We only got two calls left and you want to know why because we got Jersey guys coming up

[02:43:46.850 --> 02:43:50.190]
at two o'clock and that's, you know, people are starting to get a little bit nervous.

[02:43:50.390 --> 02:43:51.270]
They're shying away from the radio.

[02:43:51.270 --> 02:43:51.730]
Come on.

[02:43:51.890 --> 02:43:52.490]
He doesn't bite.

[02:43:52.570 --> 02:43:53.390]
He's not all that bad.

[02:43:53.390 --> 02:43:53.810]
Is he?

[02:43:53.930 --> 02:43:54.430]
Come on.

[02:43:55.330 --> 02:43:57.510]
Five-six and we've been kicking serious ass here.

[02:43:57.630 --> 02:44:01.330]
In fact, during these hot dog days of the summer last few weeks, we actually have been doing

[02:44:01.330 --> 02:44:01.690]
okay.

[02:44:01.810 --> 02:44:02.490]
Not spectacular.

[02:44:02.830 --> 02:44:04.970]
They're considering what a bunch of deadheads you are not too bad.

[02:44:05.630 --> 02:44:07.690]
But now we only got what, 12 minutes to kill here.

[02:44:08.050 --> 02:44:10.950]
And I think they're getting a little bit shying away from Jersey guys.

[02:44:11.150 --> 02:44:11.990]
Who's coming up at two?

[02:44:12.490 --> 02:44:12.830]
Four-hank.

[02:44:13.070 --> 02:44:17.070]
Five-six, seven-oh-five-sixty, pound-five-sixty on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:44:17.850 --> 02:44:18.430]
Here's Miami.

[02:44:18.610 --> 02:44:18.770]
Hello.

[02:44:20.050 --> 02:44:20.410]
Neil.

[02:44:20.570 --> 02:44:20.870]
Yes sir.

[02:44:21.090 --> 02:44:21.510]
How are you?

[02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:21.850]
I'm fine.

[02:44:21.850 --> 02:44:21.850]

[02:44:22.530 --> 02:44:25.310]
Teacher who resigned last week from day county public schools.

[02:44:25.430 --> 02:44:25.650]
Really?

[02:44:25.990 --> 02:44:27.270]
Going up to Orlando, moving out.

[02:44:27.670 --> 02:44:28.610]
Got tired of this town.

[02:44:28.850 --> 02:44:29.590]
Yeah, I don't blame you.

[02:44:29.730 --> 02:44:30.190]
I'm outta here.

[02:44:30.270 --> 02:44:30.770]
All the way to Orlando.

[02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:31.770]
Is that a picnic up there?

[02:44:32.470 --> 02:44:33.690]
I don't think it's better for me.

[02:44:34.170 --> 02:44:35.110]
I'll should be making more money.

[02:44:35.190 --> 02:44:35.630]
That's for sure.

[02:44:35.730 --> 02:44:36.830]
He did make more money than teachers.

[02:44:36.990 --> 02:44:37.170]
Right.

[02:44:37.550 --> 02:44:38.670]
So that's that's a piece of cake.

[02:44:39.450 --> 02:44:40.890]
All I have is a shameless request.

[02:44:41.070 --> 02:44:41.930]
You can put on anything you want.

[02:44:42.230 --> 02:44:43.350]
Say, leave a dirt-shape.

[02:44:43.730 --> 02:44:43.870]
Neil.

[02:44:44.690 --> 02:44:44.950]
Okay.

[02:44:45.170 --> 02:44:45.610]
Good luck, pal.

[02:44:45.790 --> 02:44:46.230]
Have a good day.

[02:44:46.430 --> 02:44:47.010]
You can give it to you too.

[02:44:47.410 --> 02:44:48.470]
Here's the guy, Betlon Outer.

[02:44:51.490 --> 02:44:51.490]

[02:44:51.490 --> 02:44:51.770]
He ran.

[02:44:51.990 --> 02:44:52.970]
It's unscibalized.

[02:44:53.090 --> 02:44:53.690]
It's barbaric.

[02:44:53.770 --> 02:44:54.150]
It's a jungle.

[02:44:55.390 --> 02:44:56.490]
And like I said, nobody cares.

[02:44:56.570 --> 02:44:58.850]
These last two days have proven to be on a shadow without here on this.

[02:44:58.930 --> 02:45:00.850]
Highly listen to a highly talented, highly rated show.

[02:45:01.230 --> 02:45:02.690]
I mean, just the nobody gives the crap here.

[02:45:06.550 --> 02:45:07.690]
And that's the sad part.

[02:45:07.790 --> 02:45:10.750]
Because there were a few people that had borrowed school board meeting, mostly media people.

[02:45:10.830 --> 02:45:11.770]
But there were some angry people.

[02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:14.670]
And even the old fart showed up, who usually are like, everybody's a pervert.

[02:45:14.830 --> 02:45:15.690]
Because they can't do it.

[02:45:15.690 --> 02:45:18.210]
But nevertheless, even they were saying, leave the guy to have their teachers alone.

[02:45:18.490 --> 02:45:20.750]
And cut the crap and stop sticking to your nose and everybody's business.

[02:45:20.750 --> 02:45:21.910]
Let us do that, you know.

[02:45:24.190 --> 02:45:26.550]
But you can't convince the people on here.

[02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:28.810]
Because there just aren't enough people who speak out on anything.

[02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:30.530]
That's why all this crap goes down.

[02:45:30.730 --> 02:45:32.490]
You know, that's why it just keeps going on and going on.

[02:45:32.490 --> 02:45:33.110]
It'll never change.

[02:45:33.250 --> 02:45:33.670]
Never end.

[02:45:34.990 --> 02:45:39.910]
And now they got this thing with a city of Miami and the former accountant for the police department in the city of Miami.

[02:45:40.190 --> 02:45:42.350]
Who died after he stole a million dollars.

[02:45:42.610 --> 02:45:44.430]
And now he's saying Donald Worsher out of police chief.

[02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:45.410]
He was involved in it.

[02:45:45.530 --> 02:45:46.650]
And the FBI is looking into it.

[02:45:46.830 --> 02:45:48.270]
And even though there's no accusations yet.

[02:45:49.430 --> 02:45:51.250]
And the beat goes on and it goes on.

[02:45:51.310 --> 02:45:53.990]
But in the meantime, where's the money going to come from for that stadium, huh?

[02:45:55.110 --> 02:45:58.650]
There's 800,000 or a million who's counting now that vanished from the city of Miami.

[02:46:00.410 --> 02:46:02.610]
But we're going to keep money for a baseball stadium, right?

[02:46:02.730 --> 02:46:02.870]
No.

[02:46:03.710 --> 02:46:08.210]
Seriously, people who are proposing these things, who are even seriously suggesting these things,

[02:46:08.490 --> 02:46:14.590]
who are even contemplating these things, even semi-seriously, those people need to be locked away to protect all the rest of us.

[02:46:14.810 --> 02:46:15.450]
They're crazy people.

[02:46:17.290 --> 02:46:18.350]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[02:46:18.510 --> 02:46:18.630]
Hello.

[02:46:19.430 --> 02:46:20.690]
Neil, thank you for taking my call.

[02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:21.950]
A couple of looking year call, sir.

[02:46:22.350 --> 02:46:25.510]
Yeah, a couple of book opinions and a profound story.

[02:46:25.650 --> 02:46:28.050]
First of all, without questions, the gaki sucks.

[02:46:28.330 --> 02:46:30.970]
And if you heard yesterday, there's a gaki sucks.

[02:46:31.550 --> 02:46:32.850]
Them for sucked also.

[02:46:33.510 --> 02:46:33.990]
At any rate.

[02:46:34.350 --> 02:46:35.590]
But he's a good guy though.

[02:46:36.470 --> 02:46:39.210]
I like him on the games, but top show host he isn't.

[02:46:39.450 --> 02:46:41.690]
Yeah, the game he's okay, but I'm just telling you, his infer is a good guy.

[02:46:41.950 --> 02:46:42.290]
All right.

[02:46:42.410 --> 02:46:42.910]
I'm going to read.

[02:46:42.910 --> 02:46:44.630]
A significant story.

[02:46:44.750 --> 02:46:45.410]
I agree with you.

[02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:48.310]
Pretty much 100% with regards to the cops.
