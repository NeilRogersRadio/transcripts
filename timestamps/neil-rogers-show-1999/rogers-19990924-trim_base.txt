[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.760]
The young man turns 28

[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.200]
He scored the sweetest bag

[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.520]
I'll go on the next day

[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.940]
It's too many seats

[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.560]
In your dime bag

[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.220]
Getting to the party

[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.520]
Two minutes to late

[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.540]
Isn't it the chronic?

[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.120]
Yes

[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.380]
Don't you think?

[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.380]
It's my free day

[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.340]
When you smile on the brakes

[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.660]
It's free day

[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.900]
When you're already late

[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.820]
You're always late

[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.720]
That's you tested and you're late

[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.340]
Who won't stop?

[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.780]
You're gonna get it

[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.920]
Hot brownies

[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.560]
That you already ate

[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.880]
A new donut time

[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.460]
A lot that you've raised

[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.540]
It's like 10,000 joins

[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.240]
When all you need is a light

[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.200]
It's like having the feel of your dreams

[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.060]
And then finding out some thoughts

[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.860]
And delight

[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.980]
And give them it's the chronic

[00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.340]
Are you sure?

[00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.740]
Don't you think?

[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.380]
A little too much chronic

[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.180]
Yeah I really do think

[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.460]
It's my free day

[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.300]
When you last long break

[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.760]
It's a free day

[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.340]
When you're already late

[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.600]
You're always late

[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.880]
That's you tested and you're late

[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.360]
Who won't stop?

[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.600]
You're gonna get it

[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.160]
You have to be kidding me

[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.800]
Women calling to put in their foot

[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.600]
their pics

[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.180]
Pick this, okay sweetheart?

[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.360]
You have to be kidding me

[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.020]
Women who never call this

[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.840]
Not just this show but this radio station

[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.480]
We'll put again their stupid and stupid football pics

[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.840]
Get a life, ladies

[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.100]
Get a freaking life

[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.820]
Man, probably a bunch of dikes

[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.480]
Anyway, another reminder

[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.280]
Geldy just told you

[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.040]
But I'll tell you again

[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.320]
Because we should have been telling you about this

[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.680]
Nevertheless, the QAM golf tournament is today

[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.320]
And its check-ins come up at 11 o'clock this morning

[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.140]
T-Off is at 1

[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.060]
The cost is 300 bucks for individuals

[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.320]
A thousand dollars for a force

[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.340]
And which includes the celebrity

[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.600]
Which makes it a fives him

[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.740]
Proceeds benefit center

[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.860]
One loco mar is on

[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.020]
Broward just west of flamingo

[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.340]
Credit cards will be accepted

[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.360]
So it's still not too late to participate

[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.620]
I'd like to give a big promo for Georgia's appearance tomorrow

[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.120]
If I could but we got a little bit of

[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.040]
What we got several problems

[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.880]
We got Gary Starner

[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.680]
He's an asshole

[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.460]
We got the nephew

[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.320]
He's an asshole

[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.420]
And then we got Sam the champ

[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.140]
He's an asshole

[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.400]
Which we'll talk about in detail

[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.600]
Here's a mobile and Davy

[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.860]
Hello

[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.580]
Our first call of the day

[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.880]
Hello

[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.060]
Hello Neil

[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.640]
Yes sir

[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.960]
I just call to tell you

[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.560]
I love you man

[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.120]
I haven't been listening to you that long

[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.860]
But I love the show

[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.800]
You do a great service for South Florida

[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.420]
What's I do

[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.480]
And you're just fabulous

[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.120]
Yes sir

[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.780]
This is what I tell you doing a great job

[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.540]
Can I hate? Can I call somebody a douche bag

[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.820]
Yeah

[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.880]
Hey Andrea, if that's in court

[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.800]
You're a douche bag

[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.460]
But I love you

[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.940]
Okay

[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.800]
Okay there you go

[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.280]
A little suction there at the beginning of the show

[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.900]
Out there wrong with that

[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.420]
Is there, huh?

[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.020]
No

[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.820]
Let's do the other one

[00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.280]
Here's Hollywood

[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.620]
Hello

[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.180]
How you doing, Neil? Good morning

[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.820]
Okay sir

[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.500]
I have a question for you

[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.080]
Regardless, what's your stance on Florida's death penalty

[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.680]
Because there's a good article in the Sun's Channel

[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.040]
I don't know you don't read that paper

[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.060]
Yes I do

[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.700]
Oh you do

[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.340]
What's my stance on it?

[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.560]
Well, pertaining to the article

[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.460]
It revolves around this most recent execution

[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.520]
That's been delayed once again indefinitely

[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.940]
Yeah

[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.040]
Because the man thinks he's Jesus Christ

[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.660]
Yeah

[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.000]
I read that

[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.040]
Oh, and...

[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.700]
That's that he's creating nothing other than a food cake

[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.960]
Yeah

[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.320]
I said he's not even a food cake sign him up for our sales department

[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.160]
Well, um, have you read it?

[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.720]
Most of them belong on death throw anyway

[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.300]
Yeah, I read it so what's the deal?

[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.440]
I just wanted to know what he thought about it

[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.500]
I say fry his ass

[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.560]
I say lethal injection

[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.140]
Let's stop using that damn chair up there

[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.260]
Too many sparks, okay?

[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.500]
Yeah, lethal injection

[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.820]
Give a little shot and say goodbye

[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.960]
Put on the side

[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.960]
Did we pass something regarding that

[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.980]
Like if there was a problem with the electric chair

[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.400]
Wouldn't it not, um,

[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.500]
curtail any executions being the use of the needle?

[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.500]
They said we don't care

[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.760]
They said, what do we buy that?

[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.840]
Um, I voted for it

[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.600]
You voted for what?

[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.820]
Um, the fact that the lethal injection

[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.380]
If there became anything unconstitutional about the use of the chair

[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.200]
When did you vote for that?

[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.460]
When did they have an election on the left?

[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.060]
The last election when you didn't vote in

[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.360]
They had a vote on that on the electric chair?

[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.960]
Yeah

[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.440]
Pretending to the death penalty, yes sir

[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.840]
Yeah, and what was it about?

[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.960]
Um, it just pertained to the unconstitutionality,

[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.520]
The potentiality of that,

[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.600]
But regarding the electric chair

[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.300]
That, uh, if it came to pass that that was happening

[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.420]
Fry the ass, man, that's what I say, fry the ass

[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.220]
We don't have time to, you know, you know what I'm saying?

[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.700]
Right

[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.360]
We don't have time to screw around with the tail

[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.360]
Fry the ass with the head

[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.140]
There's a little bit of pain too bad, that's what it's all about

[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.960]
And there's not a guy in there for 20 years

[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.060]
I mean, oh my god

[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.020]
Right, that's right

[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.200]
All right, now does it, was this guy about to say

[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.740]
How about them dolphins when they pulled when they pulled a switch?

[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.000]
Not if he thought he was Jimmy Jackson

[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.460]
Okay, I'll be right there

[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.060]
Yeah, I'll tell you one thing

[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.920]
Those three names I just mentioned, Jerry Sarner

[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.980]
The nephew, Sam the shant, he should have a three cedar

[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.020]
Is what they should have for them

[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.460]
I'll pull the switch on that

[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.520]
Jobs for life, we got so many people

[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.320]
Are you talking about life, death row and life in prison?

[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.300]
We got people who have jobs for life

[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.020]
People who give us no tangible evidence of doing anything in this place

[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.340]
Who come and steal a paycheck every couple of weeks

[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.140]
It's just amazing, here's another lady with her football picks

[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.500]
Hello

[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.720]
Hello

[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.480]
Didn't you call for your football picks?

[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.780]
Happy problem

[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.820]
How are you?

[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.680]
Yeah, I did

[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.780]
Listen to you

[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.900]
Do you like this weekend, yeah?

[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.900]
Excuse me, God

[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.380]
Do you think I can cover any of you?

[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.560]
It's often to me this weekend they got a pass, they got a free pass

[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.440]
Like the three people I just mentioned, they got a free pass, yes?

[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.040]
Tonight is air of suckers

[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.480]
Oh, and it's air of suckers, happy suckers

[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.200]
And yes, happy problem

[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.840]
That too

[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.080]
That's the other one

[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.740]
But this is suckers is for Saturday and Sunday

[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.100]
Yeah

[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.540]
And so

[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.720]
What do you do on suckers?

[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.380]
I don't know, I don't know if you eat anything special

[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.940]
I take this fruit vegetable

[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.720]
And you have a suckers out in the garden or something if you ever eat it

[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.640]
Yeah, I'll probably check out some fruit this weekend

[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.000]
Where are you going?

[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.800]
Where are you going?

[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.200]
Home

[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.520]
Home

[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:22.880]
Home?

[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.540]
Yeah

[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.240]
Home, make you any home

[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.080]
Uh-huh

[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.720]
Fentation

[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.340]
Listen, happy suckers we've heard

[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.240]
Yes, thank you, and the same cute

[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.160]
We'll find out what you're supposed to do on suckers

[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.480]
Yes

[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.240]
And don't forget

[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.320]
See your mother also

[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.360]
Right

[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.160]
Okay, I'll see you

[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.000]
Okay, bye

[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.920]
Bye, good luck

[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.760]
See you too

[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.160]
Say goodbye

[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.160]
Okay, let's find out if we got a Jew out there what you do on suckers

[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.660]
Got these Jew holidays they just keep barreling along

[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.040]
Man, start with Russia Shoda and you know I'm Kipper and Suckers and just On and On

[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.600]
And on, if you got any steel humitation from last the week, from last year

[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.040]
So while you ladies out there with your football picks it's not too late to call in

[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.140]
What is that all about?

[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.160]
Women calling in with football picks

[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.260]
God, I think maybe Barry Jackass has a point

[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.040]
Barry Jackass

[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:11.840]
He's an asshole

[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.820]
Oh man, wait till I get to that he's got a column this morning

[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.580]
If you think you're fooling anybody, Barry?

[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:16.860]
No

[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.240]
If you think there's anybody with an IQ and a minus column that's your fooling

[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:20.400]
No

[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:26.140]
With this campaign you guys are running to try to prop up a make-believe radio station that will fail by the way beyond a shadow of a doubt

[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.940]
That's already failing that has no audience

[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:33.580]
I love the last line in Barry's or column where he says the number of listeners phone calls lags at times

[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.840]
Well, I can certainly relate to that and I have an audience

[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.080]
You see Barry if you have nobody listening nobody's going to be calling

[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.220]
Even if you have a lot of people listening sometimes nobody is calling

[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.600]
But when nobody is listening it's a pretty damn sure bet that nobody's going to be calling

[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.100]
Why don't you give him a call Barry? Why don't you have a regular suck up job on there every day

[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.660]
Barry Jackass sucks on the fan every day

[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.260]
That would be great you could be unlike from ten in the morning till midnight

[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.520]
Replacing some of that high-priced talent that you spent a whole column writing about again

[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.080]
It's the 800th and Barry Jackass's 2000-part series

[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.140]
Prop it up and make believe radio station because the hero and he hate us like poison

[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.280]
Because we dare to tell it like it is you know that Barry he's an asshole

[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.680]
Nice picture too by the way Barry the girl it's the ghost of Barry Jackson in the in the new hero with their new crappy format

[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.300]
Where you can't find anything this morning?

[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:25.480]
Nine minutes after ten at five sixty WQA M on Friday you fast good

[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.820]
There paints

[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.140]
I don't think I like you anymore

[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:41.980]
You used to watch me shave now you do stare at the floor on their penis

[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.780]
I don't like you anymore

[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:53.480]
You used to be you and me you paint the town in a dirty magazine

[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.880]
That's all we needed to get back

[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:07.640]
Now it seems things change that I think that you're the one to blame their things

[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.080]
I don't like you anymore

[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.940]
You think you're right?

[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.720]
I don't think I like you anymore

[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.360]
It's when you get to drinkin'

[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:31.620]
She put me places I've never been before here right now I don't like you anymore

[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.900]
Why can't we just get a grip on our man-to-hand relations?

[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.400]
Time to turn for truly how we feel

[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:54.600]
If we put our heads together we just stay home forever and stay at paintings

[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.720]
I don't think I like you after all

[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.140]
Oh and righty while you're shaving my own

[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:10.780]
That's when the five sixty WQA we got some exciting news for your boys and girls moms and dads

[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.560]
Here you go Phil Henry are you sure?

[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.900]
So they pushed it back a week that's the bad news his syndication

[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:21.180]
But the good news the very exciting news is that he's gonna be on in this market on stupid talk just like I predicted

[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.060]
And I kind of had that in the back of my mind that they would probably do what they're gonna do and why the hell not

[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.000]
Give it a shot okay?

[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.960]
Give us a little competition here that he's on from 10 o'clock at night till one in the morning

[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.500]
And then they're gonna replay the tape the next day from nine in the morning until noon

[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.280]
How do you like that?

[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.580]
Are you sure positive? That's the information that we get

[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.760]
Can we well think we can compete with that can we?

[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.100]
No

[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.860]
So they're gonna have like six hours of Phil Henry a day now on stupid talk

[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.240]
Which I guess will probably cut back Rick and suds an hour

[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:48.580]
Uh huh

[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.880]
So I think we're probably gonna be out of business so let's go out with a big bang these last couple of weeks

[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.540]
Here's Miami hello

[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:56.860]
Neil?

[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:57.420]
Yes sir

[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.680]
I always listen to your show every day and I'm starting to get concerned

[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.920]
About because you impact a lot of people's lives

[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.300]
Uh huh

[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.280]
And I need to believe in God and now I don't even I don't believe in God anymore

[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.400]
And how about if there is a God?

[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:11.960]
Uh huh

[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.360]
You know what's gonna happen next?

[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.680]
We're gonna die

[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.760]
Yeah we'll see you in hell

[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:17.960]
You're not scared?

[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:18.440]
No

[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.260]
Are you?

[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.000]
I'm not scared

[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.520]
I only get scared when I get calls like this from chronicleos I'm gonna get real scared

[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.720]
Oh yeah you take it

[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.360]
Oh yeah

[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.800]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.020]
Pound 5 60 on it

[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.100]
And that was a real uh huh that took a real rocket scientist to figure that out

[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:34.940]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.680]
In fact as soon as I heard the voice I was thinking

[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:37.620]
Yeah

[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:38.640]
Yeah, came to mind

[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.080]
By the way we're gonna have to work real hard to build up George's appearance tomorrow

[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:48.060]
Because George asked Gary Sarner, well give us a little bit of information about my appearance at Primeco tomorrow from noon to 2

[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.580]
So I can promote it and Gary said

[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:50.140]
Yeah

[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:55.840]
And then we went to uh you know Sam the shaman and the effu to try to get some information from both of them and they said

[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.360]
Yeah

[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.300]
Which seems to be a lot of that going around these days you know

[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.100]
Uh huh

[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.980]
So we talk about Diana Ross by the way getting the first of the airport in Etro

[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.880]
Oh my god what a bitch

[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.140]
What a disgusting, desperate bitch Diana Ross

[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.100]
Who looks like by the way not a day over 85

[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.900]
Here's a call from Atlanta hello

[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.060]
Hey Neil

[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:18.560]
Yes sir

[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.620]
How are you doing this morning?

[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:19.980]
Okay

[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.380]
Listen uh just wanted to know we listen to you up here believe it or not on the internet

[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.460]
I believe it

[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.500]
And I heard your call from the thanks for hauling lady

[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.700]
I'll tell you you're not better than the meal we have to listen to locally over here

[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.440]
Real reports?

[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.060]
Mm-hmm

[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:34.640]
The worst

[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.140]
I thought you got some of the worst radio in Atlanta I've ever heard in my life

[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.260]
Cox broadcasting should be sued

[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.160]
There should be a class action suit for the crap that they put on the year on WSB

[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.380]
It's just horrible I mean it is just absolutely perfect

[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:47.680]
Yeah

[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:55.180]
But it's an insult basically what they're saying is we think everybody who lives in the metropolitan Atlanta area is a weird Yahoo who picks their nose a lot

[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.180]
And that's why we're going to put this garbage on here

[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.080]
Yeah

[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:58.980]
No picking radio

[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.560]
Pretty much, pretty much

[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:00.940]
Well that's

[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.740]
But you know I guess Atlanta does have its good points compared to Miami so that's why we're here

[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.300]
Yeah

[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.660]
But I did want to give you a little info on the

[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.220]
What are bombings stuff like that?

[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.020]
Well not actually on that actually for all things in Atlanta you're going to get some information on Pukas

[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:15.940]
Yeah

[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.600]
Okay great

[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.540]
And what it is it's a holiday it goes for seven eight days just kind of like past over

[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:21.760]
Eight days?

[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:22.400]
Yep

[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.960]
Well eight days of circus

[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.400]
Yeah the eight days is actually simple chitoro

[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.420]
So you know that's like pretty much one of the two people you go

[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.900]
Like I said they just keep on coming

[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.380]
Yeah well that's sort of like the way you are

[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.160]
They just keep on coming

[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:35.720]
Exactly

[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.340]
But it's kind of like you know a time where people actually go and build these booths out in the yard

[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.960]
And they eat out onto the stars kind of like an Italian grotto type of deal

[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.740]
Yeah what do they eat?

[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:46.540]
Anything special?

[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.940]
Well there's different fruits and vegetables like you were saying before but you know it's basically

[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:58.060]
I don't know if there's anything really special in terms of foods

[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.200]
Except some of the same stuff you eat on Rosh Hashanah but

[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:02.800]
Rosh Hashanah

[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.920]
Well let it down always pop up brisket in New York

[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.760]
Always safer but did you holiday pop up brisket in there?

[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.480]
Yeah cook it for 18 hours you know it's like shoe leather

[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.120]
Right except on your own camper that's not a good day to eat it

[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.100]
But any other day it's always a good day for brisket

[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:17.740]
Absolutely

[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.640]
Okay pal

[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.700]
Alright Neil I just wanted to give you a hello from Atlanta

[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.960]

Saiga Zun

[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.520]
Okay there you go all the way from Atlanta we had to go to get a little information about Sookas

[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.220]
Oh so anyway about your recipe, appearance tomorrow

[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:48.920]
I'm gonna be giving a little inside information by the way about the QAM dumb detective that our sales department

[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.900]
Everybody who comes to work in our sales department is a couple of these things

[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:57.560]
It's a gadget that looks very similar to those deals that they sell you to go out on the beach you know those metal detectors

[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.560]
We search for coins and we're whatever metal

[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.920]
Only it's a dumb detective

[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:04.920]
Oh yeah

[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.840]
And our sales department walks up and down the streets of South Florida

[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.680]
And every now and then when they find just the right place a little sound goes off

[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.000]
And then they walk in the door and say

[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.140]
And they say sign me up

[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.200]
Just here and just hand over the money that's all they do

[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.380]
It's amazing how many stupid people around this market to keep hand it over their money this joint

[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.720]
And do we do anything for them?

[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:24.980]
No

[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.440]
No, it's a little as possible as little as we can get away with right Gary Sarner

[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:28.820]
Uh huh

[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:29.100]
Right

[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.060]
What a pots

[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.540]
Here's a mobile in the...

[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.320]
What is that?

[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.060]
A mobile in the mobile?

[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.780]
A mobile in somewhere

[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.120]
Hello

[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:39.640]
Hello

[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.340]
Yes sir

[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.380]
Nail, is that you?

[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.160]
That's me

[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:48.440]
Nail, I have to send a story, I have to send a story, I have to send a story, I'm only in half of you

[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:55.740]
But I grew up in Chicago as a kid living next door to a family on the...the father's a rabbi

[00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.400]
And to celebrate Sookas they always built a Sookha

[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.720]
Which is a hot

[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.560]
I remember that of the Sookha Shack

[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.920]
The Sookha Shack, right?

[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:12.140]
They made this a lot of...

[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:12.800]
This is that

[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.160]
They made this hut out of branches and leaves and twigs

[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:24.640]
And fruit has a lot to do with the holiday, I think they eat nuts and fruits and things like that over sookha

[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.620]
Nuts, but...

[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:32.940]
But I enjoyed watching them build their Sookha every year and I thought that it would be a little more amazing

[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.600]
What's the point, what's the purpose of it? Do you have any idea?

[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:42.060]
They'd go in there and they'd eat their food and they'd also have prayer inside

[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:42.680]
The Sookha

[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.740]
And I think it did last for a number of days

[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.080]
And it was quite interesting watching what's going on for the next door

[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.460]
Okay, they're a lovely family

[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:53.400]
Better than us

[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.480]
Thank you very much, I'll be using the happy Sookas

[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.480]
Happy Sookas everybody from your good friend

[00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.820]
And WQAM

[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.040]
Yeah, we're out of business now that Phil Henry's gonna be online to do an everyday on tape, they're on stupid talk

[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.300]
They probably figured we're peeing in our pants, are we peeing?

[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.240]
A lot

[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.100]
No, oh yeah

[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.880]
See, because the interesting part of it is, get paid one more of the other...

[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.920]
By the way, got my check today

[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.260]
Get paid one more of the other anyway, you know

[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.720]
Now, are they gonna have somebody with a dumb detector go out and buy spots there?

[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:27.500]
5, 6, 7, 05 didn't work too good at the other place and pound 5, 60 on the mobile line

[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.220]
I'm not gonna call it... can you do MI?

[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.360]
The mobile line, the calling line, because I've got more information about that

[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.600]
Which your friend George over there at mobile one isn't gonna be real happy about

[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.180]
But nevertheless, and I'm not real happy about either

[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.860]
But as usual, we're in the dark

[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.260]
It's only, I mean, it's only our part of our lifeblood is the phone lines, you know

[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.080]
That's only what the show is all about

[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.860]
So watch out ourselves in the program by the telling and giving us any information about that

[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.360]
When they don't bother doing it about like when George is doing his appearance

[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.460]
At Prime Coast, there were no quick plans in Hollywood from noon to tomorrow

[00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.940]
And the only information we can get is just east of Sterling or Sheridan Exits at 9.95

[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.080]
What does it say just east of the Sterling or Sheridan Exits?

[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:04.800]
What does that mean?

[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.740]
The Oakwood tomato part runs the length of the...

[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.340]
Or does the property between Sterling and Sheridan and Sterling

[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.820]
Oh, so like I said, just to get off at either exit so to say

[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.640]
And I'll be recreating the events at the swing club using stock puppets

[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.640]
Come out and spin the QAM Wheel of Wind prizes as all it says

[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.280]
And that's all the information we can get on this, George will be there new to two

[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.560]
So please come out and make him feel like you're really cared about seeing him there

[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.180]
And tell him he'll be really great to be up against Phil Henry starting out to over 4th

[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.160]
Here's the pompano, hello

[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.720]
Hey Neil, yes sir

[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.720]
He's a lagging and listener phone call on 1700

[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.340]
I don't know that I've ever heard a listener phone call on 1700

[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.420]
Has the question is has anybody ever heard 1700?

[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.000]
Now whether they've ever called there, but has anybody other than Barry ever heard them from one or two or three minutes?

[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:50.860]
Well I went when they first came on, I turned out obviously out of curiosity

[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.340]
And it was just nice for a while not to hear the same calls

[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:58.020]
Hey Matt Dog, you think you're teal green is going to stretch the defenses this year

[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:04.440]
Is there running back going to be, but then they've got Jim Barry on from like 12 to 2 or 2 or 4

[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.060]
Another silly person, he's like a male angel way

[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.920]
By the way let me interrupt you for a second before I forget this

[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:15.100]
Speaking of angel array, they got a new deal now where they talk

[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.440]
They do the news on Channel 4 right up until Dan Rather starts talking

[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.800]
And they show Dan's face on the screen, they're at CBS

[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.680]
And she says yes today and now let's go to Dan Rather at CBS in New York

[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.500]
And she starts cracking up and he starts out with this horrible story about the guy getting sentenced

[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.940]
You know, but did the lynching one of the guys in the Texas

[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:38.080]
And she's just lost it, just laughing her ass off and I thought what, she needs a butterfly in that

[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.020]
She needs to be put away, angel array, but anyway I'm sorry

[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:47.560]
That's all right, when Jim Barry opens up his show he's got the intro song playing the Funk Soul Brother

[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.000]
I'm like a terrible boy

[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.620]
And this time with less funk and less soul than Jim Barry, I don't know who it is

[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:59.200]
I guess that's his whole idea like when he does that Duke and in Javan and those stupid videos he did on Channel 4

[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.140]
He's just a professional spook I guess is what he thinks he is

[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.840]
Didn't he leave town for a while and come back?

[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.000]
Yeah, they kicked his ass out and then nobody else would take him he had to come back

[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.340]
Very dismayed that he was back

[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:13.540]
The addition to which he'd been mine that he was in Chicago, he's from Chicago I guess he released he worked up there

[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.800]
He's a fan of all the Chicago sports teams, he don't even like the teams down here

[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.760]
But why was he leaving Chicago, he was just awesome, I mean that's a real time

[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.800]
Right, well if you get your ass blown out of there you gotta go somewhere

[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.480]
I sent the facts over to you last night with a couple of editorials from the show

[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.580]
I got it, I got it

[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:35.380]
Humbly, I'm trying to figure out whether that first guy is serious and that with his praise of Brian Norcross and Alex Panellis

[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:37.080]
The New Jersey guy

[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.380]
Yeah, I got it and here I'll get to him

[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.520]
Hi Neil, thanks pal

[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:39.860]
Good one

[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:40.480]
See ya

[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:45.360]
Yeah, Norcross and Panellar Penis, they're my heroes, I'll tell you that, no question about that

[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.520]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line 1026

[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.260]
We're gonna have to find out if there's anybody who's gonna still listen to us by the way from 10 to noon

[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.360]
Once Phil Henry goes on 940

[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.740]
Because otherwise I'll just stay home to him every day

[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.860]
In fact what we'll do is we'll just play Phil Henry Bitts

[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:06.540]
There is an idea, there is a great idea if it turns out that we got real problems there which I doubt

[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.820]
But nevertheless if we did because you know who wants to listen to a tape of the same show

[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.180]
But if they miss it at night they'll have to tune in the next day

[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.640]
And we want to get some real serious competition there

[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.740]
We'll just play some real good old Bitts from Phil some of the best of instead of waiting to the other stuff

[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:24.740]
You know 26 after 10 at 5, 60, WQ way

[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:27.900]
Neil, yeah

[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.360]

Yeah, my Luanne Hi

Hi

[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.720]
You like Dickies? Sure

[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.500]
I guess a lot of women do, huh?

[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.340]
I believe so

[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.800]
My woman says she loves to get Dickies

[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.760]
I say

[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.720]
She likes a lot of, yeah

[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.620]
And understands I'm gay guys like Dickies

[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.040]
Well I'm really not and I've never really thought about that

[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.560]
What's the biggest Dickies you've seen?

[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.400]
Well sir, we go out to a 72 ways

[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.360]
Oh my God, do you like little Dickies too?

[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.760]
Sir, I'm

[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.440]
I think my girl basically likes big Dickies

[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.260]
Well, is there a point to this conversation sir?

[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.340]
Yeah, just if I get to say Dickie a lot on the phone, yeah

[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.380]
Were you wanting to place an order sir?

[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.060]
For what? For clothing?

[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.800]
All right, I want to talk about Dickies

[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.780]
Well, sir, that's what we carry is clothing

[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.980]
Dickie, Dickie, mm-hmm, yeah

[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.360]
Sir, if there's no other reason that you're calling this

[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.300]
I'm not like Dickies, a lot of women like Dickies

[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.160]
I'm going to disconnect

[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.300]
No, we're talking about Dickies

[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.460]
1032 at 560 WQAM

[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.540]
567-0560, pound 560 on the Dickie line

[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.640]
We got the Jim Manit today from the QAM Gulf tournament

[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.140]
Is there any special reason why I guess Hank's on his way to New England

[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.140]
Is where he's going to be this weekend for ESPN

[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.320]
Jimmy Johnson Show between 5 and 6

[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.660]
That's the Jimmy, we could be really special Johnson Show

[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.200]
And then 6 o'clock we got talking baseball with Donnie

[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.480]
Be because unfortunately it's not over yet

[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.060]
It's getting close and they're over yet the Rockies in the Marlins

[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.020]
And then we got the Panther Lightning game on Waxi at 7 o'clock tonight

[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.180]
With Dick's McDonald, the real Dick's McDonald, please stand up

[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.800]
The first game I heard that he did was pretty damn good, right?

[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.260]
That Atlanta game and then we heard him in that Tampa game

[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.620]
Here a couple of nights ago and not too good, Dick's

[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.180]
So we'll see what you know, two out of three in bed

[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.500]
Here's Parine, hello

[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:35.680]
Parine

[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.640]
Going once

[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.360]
22 minutes and 11 seconds they waited and they're gone

[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.020]
Hank is going to Pittsburgh to do that game

[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:44.980]
Hank is going where?

[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:45.720]
To Pittsburgh

[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.260]
I thought he told me he was going to Boston

[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:50.860]
Who told you that?

[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.060]
Some voice on the phone

[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.900]
Oh, so what they're, let me ask you something

[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.560]
What difference does it make where he's going?

[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.280]
I just mentioned that in passing and right away

[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.000]
What difference does it make where he's going?

[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.880]
Okay, changed

[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.940]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60

[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.520]
And it still doesn't make any difference where he's going

[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.460]
Okay, we got a bunch of nitpickers in here

[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.120]
Like I said, Hank's going somewhere

[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.760]
That's why Madduch is on today, okay?

[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.180]
All right, okay, God

[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.040]
Maniacs, here's Miami Beach, hello

[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.680]
Who cares where Hank's going?

[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.220]
There you go

[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.280]
Listen, speaking about the baseball,

[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.300]
He said something about the baseball

[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.840]
While the Marlins are about to hit the milestone

[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.260]
Did you read that in the paper today?

[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.260]
No, I don't read about the Marlins, but I feel like

[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.160]
I just love this

[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.280]
With two more wins, Florida would avoid a hundred losses

[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.540]
Yeah, when I said, they're going out right to avoid a hundred losses

[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.200]
And he said something about golf, John Dealey, you know

[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.740]
He said he's going to say, yeah, well he said, he said, he said, he said, he's drinking

[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.960]
He said, Bob, he's got alcohol in his blood

[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:53.380]
And he's going to lose his calorie golf endorsement

[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.060]
Which is in pain of 3 million a year

[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:55.780]
Right, I saw that

[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.820]
Yes, oh, you did, I thought he was pretty, he's pretty idiot

[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.840]
Not trying to clean his act up

[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.280]
But what do you mean not trying to clean his act?

[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.200]
He said, yeah, he said he showed him on there the other day

[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.540]
He had the shakes, he said he doesn't even have to give up anymore

[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.840]
I'm just addicted, like I'm addicted to sugar

[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.360]
Yeah, I know

[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.820]
And he said, well, if it's up in Norway, I can't drink again

[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:18.500]
I got one question for you now, who decides what commercial is going to show

[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.880]
Bottom line, you or

[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.540]
How many times have we been through this?

[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:24.460]
You can do this yourself

[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.540]
You just show, you decide everything what because I'm going to show what

[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:27.860]
It's not

[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:33.800]
The panel doesn't decide what commercials go on, they only decide what your sponsors

[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.260]
They're going to endorse live commercials, but as far as the recorded spots, we have nothing to say about them

[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:43.120]
So that explains why the water moral, the gun thing went on

[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.980]
Right, well I just said that

[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.180]
We have no control over that

[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.740]
Okay, just curious

[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.320]
I listen, you have a good weekend

[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.560]
Okay, back to you sir, whatever

[00:26:51.280 --> 00:27:02.640]
How many times do we have to keep repeating the same, tired old, I mean old, and tired, and tired, and old, and ponderous, and just, oh man, it just tears your kisky's out

[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:09.400]
We have nothing to say about those freaking gun show spots, let me say it again, we work for a horror operation

[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.840]
And they're all horror operations, all of this one's in a category by itself, but nevertheless

[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:18.260]
And like I said, if you'd love our salespeople, come by with their dumb detector

[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.600]
And if you're dumb enough, just hand us a bunch of money

[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.040]
Don't expect us to do too much for you, like George's appearance at Prime Code tomorrow

[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:27.920]
Then we're having to beg and plead, I mean here it is, tomorrow, noon to two, he's going to be there

[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.940]
Expecting now people hopefully maybe to show up to make him look good, so it looks like he's doing something for the money he's getting paid

[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:37.280]
Which he'll take the money anyway, whether you show up or not, but nevertheless, in Hollywood at the open plaza

[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:44.760]
Yeah, like I said, I mean, you know, geez, we got some nerve, and they resented here the idea that we're such troublemakers

[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:50.360]
That we want some information which might induce somebody to come by and go well, what's the purpose of these appearances?

[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:55.980]
Why does anybody go anywhere, you know, just give us a little information, and they just refuse to do it

[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.840]
Hey, I'm going to tell you, I'm glad to see this competition coming from all sides

[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.320]
This is the greatest thing for anybody, I've always said that

[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:10.520]
There's nothing that makes you more lethargic and more crappy than when you got into the ballgame, all to yourself

[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:14.780]
Which this place has had now for about two years, they've had the ball game all to themselves

[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:23.880]
And now you understand why they have the Mr. Big Shot, Mr. Ego, Mr. Hot Shot Sports Guy, while he got Panicky when it joked the fan went on the air

[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.140]
And was suing this one and suing that one and the muttering and having a nervous breakdown

[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:35.160]
Because he knew that Barry Jack is the right 6,000 columns in a row to try to get everybody down there at that end of the dials

[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.060]
Is it going to work? No, no, but nevertheless, at least it'll keep him on his toes here

[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.880]
Here's a lady mobile and point and V, chill out

[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:43.300]
Hello

[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.240]
Yes, ma'am? Hi, yes

[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.360]
Do you hear me? I hear you

[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.740]
Okay, I'm calling in regards to a segment yesterday about Puerto Rico

[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.200]
Yes

[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:56.060]
Where some app called and said that Puerto Rico should be blown up

[00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:02.260]
And I just like to comment that Puerto Rico is unfortunately part of the United States

[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.240]
60% of its people live below US poverty standards

[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.440]
And unfortunately we do have a lot to be pissed off about

[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.180]
Unfortunately colonization is the downfall of civilization

[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.440]
And that is why we have plenty of reason to be pissed off

[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.640]
And I love your show

[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.100]
Okay, yeah

[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:18.760]
And have a great day

[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.060]
She loves this show, but she's pissed off

[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.740]
Well listen, can I tell you?

[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.900]
Just have a good laugh about it

[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.540]
And life goes on

[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.760]
By the way, speaking of depressing things like Puerto Rico having all that poverty

[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.400]
I mentioned yesterday I got this letter, this fact from Ryan Dorety

[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.160]
He was a student at the University of Florida in Gainesville

[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:40.340]
And he was a good friend of Brian too, one of the two kids that got killed last weekend

[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:47.000]
And the letter that he sends, and I'm sure he's probably listening right now, he facts this to me

[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.120]
And I would read it on the ear except Brian, I hate to break through the line

[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.520]
I don't know how to say this to you, but nobody cares

[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.580]
I could come on and get very emotional and the letter is very heartfelt

[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.420]
And it wouldn't take very long to read it

[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.340]
But I would be leading you down the garden path of Ryan because nobody cares

[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.560]
That's why there's nothing written about this, just about anywhere

[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.300]
And the people get brutally, they get slaughtered every day in this country

[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.020]
It's a slaughterhouse, and nobody cares

[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:15.280]
They just accept it, and we just keep rolling right along, and that's it

[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.780]
That's America for you

[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.700]
So I wish I could offer something

[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.040]
And if I sound insensitive, I'm not trying to be, but it's just pointless

[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:26.920]
You know what I'm saying, Ryan?

[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.140]
I appreciate your sentiments and your efforts

[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:35.520]
But nothing I read or do here on the ear is going to change anybody's attitudes about violence and brutality and killing

[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.860]
You know, like what time is that fight on?

[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.680]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.100]
Don't forget George is the prime co-storied of our on Hollywood

[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.060]
Noon to 2 at the Oakwood Plaza

[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:50.080]
Well if I just mention it off enough, somebody ought to show up just out of sympathy

[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.740]
They'll be singing and dancing

[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:55.920]
They'll be singing and dancing, maybe Joe Carr will show up dining and dancing

[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.780]
They don't have any free food like Joe and Gelldy got a thorough appearance tomorrow

[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.700]
But you know, you're not Joe and Gelldy yet

[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.140]
You got a long way to go until you catch up to them

[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.680]
Maybe I'll bring a bucket of chicken with me or something

[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.240]
There you go

[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.380]
Or maybe just bring those certificates, maybe for the macaroni game

[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:09.940]
Hey, there you go

[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:10.500]
You got tomorrow, huh?

[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.680]
Since those came from Gary

[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.180]
There you go

[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.960]
They came from Gary Sartre, that'll tie Ryan in

[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.820]
We'll give away some certificates for some pre meals

[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.180]
It macaroni grill at George's appearance tomorrow

[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.400]
Like it's been the wheel for him

[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.520]
There you go, it's been the wheel

[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.620]
And say, leave it to me to come up with something even though I got nothing to do with this

[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.440]
Well, somebody's got to try for you for Christ's sake

[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.580]
This place here is Elwant

[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.300]
Well, what is that that keeps beeping?

[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.020]
Is that a nair? Is that a nair? What is that?

[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.360]
Is that this thing again?

[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.020]
Let's be in the end

[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:34.720]
Oh god

[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.320]
20 before 11 at 560 WQM

[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.380]
If you're sure as a gacky stuck, okay?

[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.120]
Okay

[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.860]
When a moon is hanging out a window

[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.200]
On the floor that's proud of his behind

[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.320]
You've now received way too much info

[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.800]
And the image is purged into your mind

[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.320]
There's nothing grosser than a man with a hairie ass

[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.480]
And with a hairie ass

[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.440]
A hairie ass

[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.880]
A hairie ass

[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.440]
Doesn't have a girl's libido

[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.520]
When you wear a tiny fetal

[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.120]
She can take a look much neater

[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.940]
If you buy a good weed eater

[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.360]
It's a problem that she must have even

[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.600]
Up that boon is more evolved

[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.980]
A hairie ass

[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.440]
A hairie ass

[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.380]
When a girl is lying in a dark room

[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.800]
Her brand new lover's naked in her bed

[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.780]
She runs her fingers down his body

[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.240]
And lets out a screen that wakes her death

[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.100]
Her hands are tangled up in his hairy hair

[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.960]
Her hands are tangled up in his hairy hair

[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:57.000]
Her hands are tangled up in his hairy hair

[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:57.220]
Her hands are tangled up in his hairy hair

[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:57.580]
Oh, right.

[00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:59.660]
45 to 5.5 feet.

[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.140]
You're welcome. WQAM.

[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.580]
Dolphin show is star of Wap and lineup says very jackass

[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.020]
But new station needs to show up the rest of its schedule.

[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.780]
This would be hysterical if it weren't so pathetic.

[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.760]
Very, like I said before, you think you're fooling anybody?

[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:13.060]
No.

[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.000]
Even a retardant.

[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.120]
No.

[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.380]
Even a invasible.

[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:15.640]
No.

[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:17.180]
Even a people at 0.0.

[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:17.280]
No.

[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:17.640]
No.

[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.360]
This is so tragic, which I will read by the way in its entirety.

[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.460]
Just in case you missed the arrow or just in case you couldn't find the sports section.

[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:31.920]
Yeah, they read the format of the arrow that anybody see it the most pathetic, the most unacceptable.

[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.180]
You can't find anything.

[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.960]
For example, the editorial page is in section B.

[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.500]
Wasn't bad enough that it used to be, you know, every newspaper I know of the editorial page

[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.380]
at least Monday through Saturday is on a back inside page.

[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.340]
So it's easy to find.

[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.220]
Then the hero decided, well, that wasn't good enough.

[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.020]
That was too easy.

[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.920]
So they're moving like two pages back inside.

[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.560]
Now that they've come up with their new format where you can't find anything, it's back in the B section somewhere.

[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.560]
And then we'd be really confused.

[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.620]
Here's Hollywood.

[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:00.980]
Hello.

[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.600]
With a question, Mark.

[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:02.880]
Hello.

[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:03.440]
Neil.

[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:03.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.580]
Neil, you're so pathetic.

[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:07.300]
You okay?

[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.000]
Thanks for listening.

[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.060]
Thanks for listening to the 560 QAM.

[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:10.800]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.400]
South pathetic.

[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:12.860]
That's why you're listening, pal.

[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.100]
Thank you very much.

[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:22.300]
Another crappy old craggy disgusting old fart taken up space that living and breathing people could be taken up here.

[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:31.340]
Oh, by the way, speaking of that, anybody ever almost get into wrecked because you somebody saw something in a pedestrian like that looked really incredibly good all the time.

[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.140]
Not like this, though.

[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.520]
I was going to the post office there on high.

[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.600]
This last time I'm going east on Oakland Park Boulevard.

[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:38.940]
And I'll be very specific.

[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.480]
It was about 520 in the afternoon.

[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.420]
Maybe this young man might be listening right now.

[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.480]
Come on down and just sit around here with your shirt off, pal.

[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:51.040]
So there was like a little fender vendor in the cop had the two cars in the left end and turn lane right around 115 terrorists in Oakland Park.

[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.420]
Going east there on Oakland.

[00:34:54.400 --> 00:35:01.640]
And here's the young man standing in his jeans with his shirt off, which even though it's 100 degrees down here for some reason only ugly people here run around naked.

[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.960]
Have you ever noticed that real fat ponchy people run around like the French Canadians.

[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:06.940]
So help me God.

[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.700]
I thought I was going to have a wreck right there.

[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.720]
Thank the Lord.

[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:15.720]
There wasn't a lot of traffic because I wasn't paying no attention who was in front of me behind me to my right only to my left.

[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.380]
I don't think I've ever seen anybody in history of my life who looked like that.

[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.120]
And I said to myself, holy crap.

[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.980]
But it happens very rarely here because very rarely here.

[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.360]
Most of the people here are like this last fossil that call from Hollywood.

[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.880]
Yes, I'm about that.

[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:33.200]
Yeah.

[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.540]
What the hell would you do if I weren't here, pal?

[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.100]
What would you do?

[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.440]
What would you be doing for these four hours every day?

[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.380]
Probably a little Russian will not practice no doubt.

[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.060]
Maybe that was very jackass as a boyfriend.

[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.960]
Here's Miami Beach. Hello.

[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:47.940]
Hey, Neil.

[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:48.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:48.880]
How are you doing?

[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:49.440]
Great.

[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:50.140]
Yeah, listen.

[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:57.960]
I wanted to call you earlier in a week but I couldn't because I was working but I really enjoyed your shows on hazing and initiations of the police.

[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:12.940]
I had a friend of mine who went to Florida State and he told me what one of the fraternities did up there was they had a thing called the Olive Race where they take the guys that are trying to get into the fraternity.

[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:17.060]
They wake them up like a three, four o'clock in the morning, take them to a field, get them all naked.

[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.520]
Get them all naked.

[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.260]
How do you like that?

[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:21.100]
Always get them all naked for starters.

[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.580]
Maybe a little booze first and then get them all naked, yeah.

[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:27.900]
Yeah, they put them on all fours and they stick an olive in their ass.

[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:28.740]
Back them, yeah.

[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:37.880]
And then they make them like crawl or on all fours like I guess 50 or 100 yards and the loser has to eat all the olives.

[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.080]
Hmm.

[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.980]
Ain't that yummy, yeah.

[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.520]
That's right, it's terrible.

[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.900]
I mean, talk about anal retentive.

[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.320]
I think there are bunch of fruit cakes in all those fraternities.

[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:49.300]
Sounds like it to me.

[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.300]
Hey, one more thing.

[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.480]
Doesn't sound like a real heterosexual pursuit to me, but what I know, yeah.

[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:54.000]
Yeah, right.

[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:55.320]
One more thing.

[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:55.780]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.420]
What's your opinion on the people's elbow?

[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:01.760]
The what?

[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.120]
The people's elbow.

[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:04.280]
Which is what?

[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:05.960]
Don't you watch pro wrestling?

[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:11.360]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.080]
The people's, what do you say the people's rectum?

[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:15.560]
Oh, yeah.

[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.880]
Save those olives for your martini by the way, pal.

[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.820]
Here's a mobile and Cooper City.

[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:21.080]
Hello.

[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.120]
Nea, I think that guy couldn't get into the fraternity.

[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:24.940]
I think that's what happened.

[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.240]
Maybe just couldn't get the olive out of the rectum.

[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.200]
Happy, happy, suck this meal.

[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:29.680]
Yeah.

[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.900]
You keep me up on the Jewish holiday and the addition goes along with it.

[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.540]
I'm going to go see George tomorrow and I think I'll have time.

[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:40.280]
You're not the guy that's right and to go that other time, are you?

[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.460]
No, no, no, no.

[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.060]
No.

[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.540]
Because that guy is not going to go.

[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:47.680]
You could probably goose the numbers up for the appearance that he brings his wife.

[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:48.640]
I hear she's pretty hot.

[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:49.020]
Uh-huh.

[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.240]
Maybe give away a swing date with George and his wife.

[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:51.760]
There you go.

[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.160]
And I bet it's a good idea.

[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.860]
He control for a swing partners tomorrow.

[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.260]
Yo, could I make a suggestion?

[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:56.860]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.620]
Why don't you get a pound 5, 60 prime co-line?

[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:04.820]
That's the only reason I don't switch to prime co-s because I'm too cheap to call you as it's on my dime.

[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.880]
Hey, listen, listen, I have no control over any of these things all over the next few days.

[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:10.720]
I am going to be discussing with the powers that be here.

[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.820]
They've got to do something with his phone or else they can blow it out their ass.

[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:18.180]
Right down the phone sucks, but right down the prime co- idea.

[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:18.640]
Okay.

[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:19.980]
I can buy a phone tomorrow.

[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:20.460]
Thanks.

[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]
Big jam and pool pod, major douche bag.

[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:23.320]
See ya.

[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:26.760]
Yeah, suggest that to them while you're there, by the way, to my George Wachiann listening

[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.080]
because he's arguing with somebody on the phone.

[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.800]
Suggest that to them tomorrow at prime co-

[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.080]
that we get along.

[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:36.340]
We need all the lines we can get because we've got a whole bunch of people out there who can't call.

[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.980]
And if we're going to expect the listeners to pay on their dime to call this place

[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:44.000]
and wait through these long-pinder risk commercial breaks, we've got another, I think, coming.

[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:49.020]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.160]
Here's a mobile and crawl springs.

[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:50.460]
Hello?

[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:59.440]
If you get a pound 5, 60 prime co- line, I'll drop my AT&T phone tomorrow because I've got a prime co- phone that's not currently hooked up.

[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.620]
And I'd left to go back to them.

[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:01.600]
The reception is great.

[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:01.940]
Yeah.

[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.160]
Aside from that, the...

[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:09.960]
I have Miami-Herald editorials are to be back in the classified section since they're all bought and paid for.

[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:10.480]
Mm-hmm.

[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:11.340]
And...

[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.520]
Maybe next to the funny pages.

[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.280]
Absolutely.

[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.560]
That's about it, Neil.

[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.200]
Okay, see ya.

[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:18.500]
Woo!

[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.240]
Okay, that clears the board.

[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.520]
Now we can get into very jackass as Colin looks like I said.

[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:27.000]
I will read in this in turn because it's well worth it to show you just how desperate.

[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:32.400]
I mean, you know, you've got a major market newspaper and you use this putts as like a pawn is what he is.

[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.300]
He's the tool.

[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:40.400]
Dolphin show is star of Waffin lineup, but new station needs to show up the rest of its schedule since very jackass.

[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:46.120]
Nearly a month has passed and 17 under the fan launch this outflow to second sports radio stage.

[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:50.060]
See, Barry would like to be a hundred sports radio stations because he's such a moron.

[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.640]
He's such he's the ultimate nerd.

[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.140]
So he really believes that's all that anybody cares about.

[00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:00.480]
Unfortunately, like the nighttime signal, the quality of the programming has been hit and miss since Barry.

[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.660]
Rhymes with one listener scorecard, meaning his of course.

[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.720]
And of course, are there any other listeners?

[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.000]
No, so we should have said their listener scorecard.

[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:19.640]
The evening pro the Dolphin's program, 6th APM with Harold sportswriter Armando Salguera and XQAM freelancer Bruce Warner has emerged as the station's best talk show.

[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.320]
And no, this opinion has nothing to do with Salguero being a Harold college.

[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.120]
He says without now here's the caper.

[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:35.100]
Without question, the show provides more quality information for Dolphans than any other regular sports talk program in the market.

[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.060]
Are you ready for that?

[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:48.600]
The fans Dolphin show has the potential to do the most damage against WQAM, which often airs dull, limited appeal marlins and panthers pregame shows during part of that time slot.

[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:56.220]
Now, I have no qual, we know, qualable what he just said about how dull those pregame shows are.

[00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:00.080]
And of course, the marlins games, anything to do with them is dull and a tune out, but.

[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:06.160]
But the casted in those terms makes it so obvious you'd have to be deaf dumb blind.

[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:10.540]
You'd have to be like Helen Keller and Vidded for 50 years, not to see where this is all coming from.

[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:11.100]
Barry.

[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:22.400]
Yeah, they got more Dolphans, get more information, then like from the Jimmy, we could be special show or from Hank or from Jim Manditch or from Dave, one stat or any of these things.

[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:25.160]
It's Armando, Salguero and Bruce Warner.

[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:29.160]
They provide you with more Dolphin information without question says Barry.

[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.740]
Then we get to the mid days.

[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.320]
Okay, see, we think that Phil Henry is going to be a stiff competition.

[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.180]
Wait to hear this.

[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.800]
Scott Kaplan and Sid Rosenberg.

[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:46.640]
Hey, who broadcast their syndicated show on more than 25 radio stations as well as the internet have good chemistry and engage in lively, often amusing dialogue.

[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:55.640]
They're 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. program, Phil's a real niche because WQA and there's non sports programming in parentheses, Neil Rogers during that slot.

[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:07.260]
Rosenberg in particular impresses with his depth of knowledge and quick retorts, but the show drags at times, such as when Rosenberg recites his weekend plans, who cares and spends several minutes guessing which.

[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.140]
That was the highest grossing movie of the summer.

[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:15.720]
Why didn't Kaplan just give the answer and move on also produces go overboard on sound effects on that show says Barry.

[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.440]
They they feel a real niche.

[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.500]
There's a tremendous void.

[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:30.400]
There's a tremendous vacuum and need in this market for another sports program between 10 and 2 because in parentheses Neil Rogers is on not the highest rated talk show in the market is under in that period of time.

[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:41.800]
Never never ever has Barry of course because he got such tremendous integrity never has he ever mentioned since he wrote those horrible doom and gloom predictions about what would happen in this radio station if Neil Rogers came on the air here.

[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:50.900]
About the ratings that we've had and how we exceed by like take all the other talk shows put together and we probably are like on a par with that or maybe a got him beat.

[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:54.280]
Put together to put that in there Barry.

[00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:09.800]
No the afternoon programming has been more locally oriented in the station originally envision GM Tony Colata you whatever name is tried to require rights to the popular mic in the mad dog show from the fan in New York but WFA and would not cooperate because it feared calls from Miami would hurt ratings.

[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:24.160]
And believe me they would if they were heard to calls for Miami they would know they would hurt ESPN radio meanwhile decided to remain with WQAM even though QMA is very little of its programming that prevented Colata you from pursuing the rights.

[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:31.220]
And Patrick's new ESPN radio talk show one to four PM are carrying any of Tony Cornhole Tony Cornholes 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. program.

[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:33.540]
You know Tony Tony Cornhole.

[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:42.540]
See George this is all foreign language to George you don't understand it that's because you're not part of the fraternity you're not part of the goddamn club man you better get with it.

[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.300]
Okay to be continued in the moment 1056 of QAM.

[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.660]
This is 560 QAM.

[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.000]
I'm the one big shot.

[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.580]
I've been on stage at night.

[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:23.380]
I'm sick.

[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.300]
Take a closer.

[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.100]
Ben stop dancing in the eye.

[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:31.800]
I know that I should make them stop putting on with me.

[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:32.940]
It's my own.

[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.580]
If I could ring a dial.

[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.740]
Every day I have night.

[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.740]
I'm driving the wind and no gun.

[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:43.660]
I'm with my hands and legs.

[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.120]
I'm driving the wind and no gun.

[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.120]
Every day I drive a wind and no gun.

[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.160]
It's my own.

[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.440]
It's my own.

[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.080]
I'm driving the wind and no gun.

[00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.660]
I'm driving the wind and no gun.

[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.160]
I'm driving the wind and no gun.

[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:02.380]
I'm driving the wind and no gun.

[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.240]
Love it 0205 60 WQM.

[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:09.580]
So continuing with Barry's masterpiece this morning believe me it goes on and on.

[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:10.080]
Which is good.

[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:10.860]
It'll feel some good time.

[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.840]
Unlike a few WQM hosts Jim Barry to the 4 p.m.

[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:19.600]
Treats collars with respect and does not level personal attacks against athletes and others.

[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:21.100]
He's nice.

[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:23.680]
He's silly but he's nice.

[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.160]
He's also attracted quality guests including several heat players.

[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:31.960]
But Barry whose veteran television needs a co-host to generate spicier conversation.

[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:37.840]
His theme shows such as recalling best sports memories should be saved for a slower time of the year like July.

[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.800]
The late afternoon show for the 6 p.m. needs an overhaul.

[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:47.100]
X Dolphin Mercury Morris who continues an on-air audition says nothing the average fan wouldn't know.

[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.840]
Incredibly Morris recently refused to say where he thinks Dan Moreno ranks among the league's best quarterbacks.

[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:56.000]
That's what we're paying you for co-host John DeCandido pointed out exasperated.

[00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:03.460]
The obscure DeCandido co-out competent but colorless has had to assume too large a rule because of Morris deficiencies.

[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:09.500]
Station Minority Owner, more testy's distrata, the show's third host must have instrared sports knowledge beyond baseball.

[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.320]
And then here comes Barry's frustration because Barry of course hates Hank like,

[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:18.900]
hates me but he hates, he has multiplied times 100 and you got how much he ate Hank.

[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:23.740]
Can't 1700 come up with a more formidable show and it's most important time slot.

[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.300]
Ask the very exasperated Barry. Can't they do it?

[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:26.600]
No.

[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:32.460]
Collotto you to impress the ringer stood on WQAM says he doesn't have time to go on air but he'd be an improvement over DeCandido.

[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.860]
1700 the fans should continue experimenting with guestos.

[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.980]
Matt Moore for instance until it finds the right mix god damn it.

[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:42.060]
Barry's pissed off. Can't they do something better against that fatso?

[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:49.060]
The Harold's Dan La Bastard couldn't join 1700 the fan because WQAM picks up his ESPN radio show.

[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.160]
Why we don't know.

[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:54.660]
Wami's marked Joan's way of discussions with 1700 didn't have time to do a late afternoon show.

[00:46:55.820 --> 00:47:02.480]
The most eye opening development has been evening co-host Judy Prado's ability to secure live interviews with Mark Keane.

[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.660]
He gets like Albert Belgeri Sheffield Ricky Williams and Matrizment.

[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:11.420]
The personable Prado who should become more polished over time hasn't received any help from Seth Jacobson.

[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.820]
Her co-host on the 8 to 10 PM Sports Night Club.

[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.520]
Jacob Sports Night Club.

[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.420]
How do you like the name of that show? That's perfect.

[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:26.280]
Jacobson a whanny producer goes off on too many enane tangents such as questioning women callers about flirting techniques

[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:29.260]
and asking Prado which soap she uses and does she drop it.

[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:36.160]
1700 is carrying sports 20 hours a week days with Don I'm a syndicated show 6 to 10 a.m. Occupying the other four hours.

[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:40.060]
You notice the way he like he shifts that to the end of this article morning drive.

[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:45.020]
Like that's not important at all. The old dead man in the chair. Don and his brother Fred in the ranch.

[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:49.200]
He's on 6 to 10 a.m. Occupying the other four hours. Those throw away called morning drive.

[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:57.120]
Weekend programming has been sold and including live NFL and college games and boomerah size and syndicated radio show at 8 a.m. on Saturdays.

[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:02.840]
Colota use it ad sales have been strong and insist he's got the financial resources to survive long term.

[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:06.040]
But the number of listener phone calls lags at times.

[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.060]
Says Berry.

[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:11.920]
How is that possible? How could you not have a whole bunch of calls all the time?

[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:18.800]
Huh? Do we have any now? No. No, we don't have a one on the board and we have an audience.

[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:23.420]
So you can just imagine when you have nobody listening which they do at 17 on the end of the dial.

[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.920]
And this is what you're up against here as far as the media is concerned.

[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:31.980]
We work for a station that doesn't promote at all that won't spend a dime to promote anything on this radio station.

[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:36.440]
And we got people in the media and of course yes we do rip them all the time but deservedly so.

[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.340]
For things unassociated with this.

[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:45.600]
But here's a campaign going on. Oh they're just they're salivating over there and you know something is going to work. No.

[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:49.340]
We and you know something we had and never had one person call seriously.

[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:54.700]
Now one person that wasn't a quack who said anything to say about any of the programming on radio station.

[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.540]
None zero. Zipity doda. Not a not a one.

[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:05.760]
Just like we have an had one call about the exciting announcement about Phil Henry going to be on the air 10 o'clock at night till one in the morning and then tape 90.

[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:10.700]
I'm the noon opposite us the last two hours every morning on the 940 stupid talk if I had one call about that.

[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:12.560]
No, not a call not one.

[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:19.860]
Such as the state of broadcasting in this market boys and girls no wonder Tom jica sold his radio.

[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.780]
No wonder dr. Mark was himself set when they repote his radio.

[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:29.260]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:35.680]
I got news for you Barry if there's any interest in 1700 to fan we sure aren't hearing about it on this station. I'll tell you that.

[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.460]
They must all be listening over there.

[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.820]
Here's a mobile and Tamarack hello.

[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:50.020]
Hey Neil how you doing this is Joe. Where is this station coming out of because I'm up in Tamarack and I get 1700 but I don't get the station.

[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.480]
Yeah. Well what do you get?

[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.640]
It's like real static you can hardly hear it.

[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.420]
Uh huh. You mean how can I say that?

[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.020]
Well they got about six watts I think.

[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:04.960]
And at night you can't hear it anywhere unless you're sitting under their tower.

[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.320]
Well I don't think they're going to make it.

[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:11.900]
Okay thanks Tony there's our first call on the bathroom maybe the maybe the second mentioned today.

[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.640]
Oh well he can't hear it so it's not really a comment he just can't hear it.

[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:20.400]
That's the comment we can't hear it or maybe our radio won't pick it up which your lottery is the don't go that high.

[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:27.720]
Barry I think you you must be doing the jungle juice Barry you must be on acid because it's just ain't going to happen sweetheart.

[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:35.120]
And as much as like I said before about the about the dumb detector we got to find some of the people that buy stuff on this radio station.

[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:40.060]
I got news for anybody who would buy spots on that radio station that has no discernible audience whatsoever.

[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:44.860]
You really got to be crazy how about a dollar a holler sounds pretty good overpriced at best.

[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.500]
Here's a mobile in North Miami hello.

[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.920]
Yeah he's lucky you can't hear it because it shows sucks.

[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:52.660]
Yeah thanks got nothing to worry about.

[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:54.240]
Okay thanks Woody.

[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:00.140]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:09.040]
He must be he must is a durable muster ran away or something because this week all of a sudden after a long height is what he's making a big comeback must be desperate.

[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.740]
Here's Fort Myers hello.

[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:13.580]
Hello Neil.

[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:19.380]
Yes I'll tell you the baseball season ever and I mean it's just a deny.

[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:23.700]
One more week pal just hang on it's almost there we're almost over with this Marlon craft.

[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:33.120]
I'll tell you I just don't know if I can take it seems like every time I get in the car unfortunately I work when you're on so I haven't been able to get as much as you as I want.

[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:36.100]
Yeah you're so really great I'll tell you I love it.

[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:36.800]
It really is.

[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:48.180]
But you know every time I get in my car at night it's a pregame it's an aftergame it's like why would any advertisers or want that audience that is going to be sitting home listening to the Marlon game.

[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.820]
I mean those people don't want to spend any money.

[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:59.060]
I mean it's just terrible it really is but hey the Tom Green show keeps me going and I didn't realize that was it a no one or repeat last time.

[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:05.160]
You know what I mean too because they've been screwing around putting on those repeats I haven't really been keeping up on.

[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:06.120]
Those are the repeats to October.

[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.560]
Oh repeats to October we didn't miss anything man thank God.

[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:14.780]
Excellent well I'll tell you what the real world this seems to be getting a little interesting the guy.

[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:19.580]
The guy was a blonde hair the gay guy is like turning on everybody so.

[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:20.600]
That fruit cake.

[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:23.980]
I don't watch that no more I don't watch just.

[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:32.100]
He's got to a bitchy queen for me it's gotten pretty good I'll have to really have you give it another chance and take a look at it.

[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:32.600]
Okay pal.

[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.860]
Hey Neil thanks a lot.

[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:34.460]
Have a great weekend.

[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:34.780]
Bye bye.

[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:40.420]
Okay call from four Myers why bet you if we had an 800 number we'd be getting Zidians a call from over there.

[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.500]
But hey don't start that again.

[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:48.640]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line Friday you.

[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:49.640]
You.

[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:49.640]

[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.480]
Here I let it.

[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:09.940]
I don't know if you remember me but I was the guy whose house you said I'm fire last year.

[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:16.320]
God I miss you even though you blew up my car.

[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:19.980]
Car all my hair off I miss you.

[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:23.900]
But one quick question.

[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:30.260]
Do you think you could let me know when you might let me out of this.

[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.940]
No one said me for weeks but I'm not complaining.

[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:42.080]
Don't misunderstand me because I love you with all my heart but if you happen to see my mother please let it go.

[00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:43.740]
I'm not dead yet.

[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:46.100]
Fear of landings.

[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:52.660]
I want to tell you that the guy you saw with your best friend that wasn't me.

[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:59.080]
He kind of looked in top just like me but that surely purely coincidental.

[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:01.740]
I was the way near that place.

[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.020]
I love you too much to look at anyone else.

[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.740]
Fear of landings.

[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:12.900]
I had a dentist appointment that day and I was the way near the church.

[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.340]
Metalheads hotel.

[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:19.380]
I would never cheat on somebody who treats me so good.

[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:23.140]
Who wins all those rammies has all that money.

[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:25.100]
Make my life be out of it.

[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:27.960]
I'm 15 at 560 WQM.

[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:29.960]
God Krull has changed in the 24 hours.

[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:34.540]
5607 0560.560 on the 18T wireless line.

[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:35.820]
Lighten up a little bit.

[00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:40.040]
Speaking about that desperate bitch Diana Ross.

[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:44.260]
I noticed it must have been in the paper here yesterday because I didn't see anything about it.

[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.420]
I did see a little clip here and there on the TV news.

[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:47.500]
About two seconds.

[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:50.340]
A desperate attempt for a news story.

[00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:53.100]
See I know that anytime I'm in the airport all the media.

[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:57.300]
They're all behind me, all the people at TV crews and the cameras and the boom microphones.

[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:05.880]
So I'd like to just be a coincidence that they're all hanging out on the heat throw waiting for Diana Ross to get pissed off because she got frisked when she went through the metal detector.

[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:14.140]
And I know if I'm going to go through a metal detector with the airport, I always wear a big fluffy thing like she was wearing with a lot of feathers and stuff and with metal buttons on it.

[00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:27.180]
That's my favorite as a matter of fact to make sure the metal detector goes off and Diana to make a long story short was all bent out of shape and made a big stimulus and a big publicity thing out of the fact that this woman when she set the metal detector off that she first.

[00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:30.160]
Squeezer boob.

[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:36.760]
So I'm channel surfing last night and here's my good friend because there was absolutely nothing else on.

[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:37.260]
Don't be trusted.

[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:41.160]
And who's he got on for the entire hour we got around for the entire hour.

[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:49.840]
Diana I'll get back to you Diana and every time he might ask for anything that might even be slightly embarrassing which is unusual for him.

[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:53.280]
Larry I can't hear you I can't I'm having a hard time hearing you Larry.

[00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:02.460]
To make a long story short the woman first and of course if Larry who I'm sure has traveled abroad who's been abroad in a prior life.

[00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:15.360]
I mean you gotta know that in Europe unlike here when you go to the metal detector when you set it off they don't just have the little wand like they do here they're serious about it they got a woman if you're a woman a woman of first you and if you're a guy a man first you.

[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:17.360]
That's the way they do it.

[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:29.440]
I've been first over there and unfortunately the guy that did it was ugly but nevertheless so she's all upset well I don't think she was really doing anything on tour but she was doing her job and it was very busy but she was it was just unacceptable.

[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:45.960]
It was doing it too fast and her hands up there under my breast and in between my legs and down on my backside well guess what Diana that's what they call frisking okay so I've had let's see through a fit and a hammer genus and then came back and did the same thing to the woman said how's that feel like I did it that brought on the MTV Awards.

[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:50.840]
Yeah this is Diana's new thing she's running around grabbing boobs all over the world.

[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:56.400]
Maybe that's her new deal now to try to prove I was going to say her masculinity.

[00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:18.140]
So they got around here and I couldn't turn it off I'll be honest with you because she kept getting more and more embarrassing and then they dragged her away to pull these took her away and they finger print it her and did a whole song of dance and too bad okay you don't act up at the airport Diana but like I said where do these camera crews and all these all the boom mics and all the stuff where they come from.

[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:26.380]
Talk about desperate desperate and who gets sucked into it for an entire hour putting her on national TV again.

[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:27.640]
Don't be just unbelievable.

[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:30.860]
Here's Davie hello.

[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:33.820]
Yeah Nioh.

[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:34.160]
Yes sir.

[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.780]
Yeah what's going on with Phil Henry is he going to be on or what?

[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:39.840]
Do you have any idea?

[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:42.600]
No I have nothing about it.

[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:47.220]
Who Phil Henry is?

[00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:47.740]
Phil who?

[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:49.420]
He's going to be on another station.

[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:51.540]
What are you listening sir?

[00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:52.760]
Why would you listen to me?

[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:57.700]
Why would you ask you been listening all along I got you explaining it to you very clearly.

[00:57:57.700 --> 00:57:59.420]
I just I missed that plot.

[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:03.220]
Yeah he's going to be on 940 stupid talk.

[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.760]
940 stupid talk.

[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:11.260]
10 p.m. to 1 a.m. and then they're going to replay the tape 9 in the morning till noon every day so you can listen to it while I'm on the 3.2 hour.

[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.820]
Oh why wouldn't do that.

[00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:13.700]
Yeah you would.

[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:18.340]
Anyway sister loves you she's the nature she's works with center one.

[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:19.060]
Okay.

[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:20.880]
Okay.

[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:21.860]
Okay.

[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:22.300]
Okay.

[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:22.800]
Okay get some help.

[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:25.420]
Okay 5 6 7 0 5 60.

[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:29.600]
That's our first comment about Phil Henry being on the air and he's kind of like you know.

[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:35.760]
I don't understand these people it's like oh what are we going to get Phil what's going to happen and I'll like to give you the big news.

[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:41.960]
Which I didn't have to because obviously they're going their desperate over there going to stick them on against us for a couple of hours every day on the tape.

[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:43.380]
Thinking that that's nice.

[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:45.040]
Come on people you're a genius baby.

[00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:46.880]
You're a desperate genius.

[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.500]
Here's a mobile in the Weston hello.

[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:54.000]
Mobile in Weston.

[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:55.540]
Deal God.

[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:56.140]
Yes sir.

[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:58.800]
Can't help these people slow it there or what?

[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:01.300]
Now my phone is beeping at the same time.

[00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:01.600]
Okay.

[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.020]
Long time listener first time call.

[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:04.540]
Yes sir.

[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:08.020]
And this is your second Phil Henry call I just tuned in.

[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:11.720]
Let it start October 4th Monday October 4th a week from Monday.

[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:13.440]
Oh my God can it be true.

[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:14.840]
It's like into this town.

[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:15.100]
Yeah.

[00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:21.280]
You know I've got a buddy who's a limo driver and he used to drive Phil Henry around a lot.

[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:22.140]
He was telling me his story.

[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:22.520]
He was on time.

[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:26.740]
He picked him up from the airport when he's come back from Michigan when partying with him all night.

[00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.840]
He said he's just as hilarious in person as he is on the radio.

[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:30.180]
Yeah.

[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.080]
He's a funny guy.

[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:32.000]
Yeah I bet.

[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:32.740]
I bet.

[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:33.500]
I love the meal.

[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.060]
All right Neil I'm not a material.

[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.040]
Yeah I can talk to you up with him.

[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:36.420]
Good news.

[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:36.960]
Okay.

[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:37.960]
Have a good day.

[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:39.200]
The nice knowing you.

[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:39.500]
All right.

[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:41.580]
5667 0560.

[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.860]
Pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:44.260]
That's all right.

[00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:44.880]
I can handle it.

[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:48.860]
Colin say you're goodbyes now because you know we may not have a chance to speak between now and

[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:49.740]
October 4th.

[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:50.740]
I can handle it.

[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:51.300]
I'm a big boy.

[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:53.720]
Here's a cruel Gables.

[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:54.000]
Hello.

[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:54.960]
Neil.

[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:55.520]
Yes sir.

[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:57.580]
The best part of it is goodbye after Laura.

[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:58.340]
Yeah.

[00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:00.500]
But I am looking forward to this.

[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:04.380]
Thank you for letting us know because Rick and Sud said nothing about it.

[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:07.620]
I know this is the first place in the world that this has been made.

[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:11.560]
Like anytime anything happens in radio you always hear about it first on this show.

[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.940]
This is the only place where we unleash the truth.

[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.820]
Well it even television.

[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.760]
The first time I hear about it is on your station.

[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:17.960]
Right.

[01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:20.400]
So you know it doesn't come to any surprise.

[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.720]
I am looking forward to it.

[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.660]
When I was living up north I listened to Phil Hendry when he was in Atlanta.

[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:27.360]
Yeah.

[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:29.140]
And I love your show.

[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.880]
It's great and thank you for letting us know.

[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:31.400]
Okay.

[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:32.300]
All right.

[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:32.840]
I'm not paranoid.

[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.760]
I know you won't be listening to us anymore.

[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:35.320]
You'll be listening for a little bit.

[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.080]
I will listen to him.

[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.800]
I will listen to him alive at night.

[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:39.060]
Oh.

[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:41.540]
That would not make sense to me I would think you know.

[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:45.320]
But if you don't want to stay up till one in the morning you probably have to listen the next morning couple.

[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.760]
Well I will listen to it while I work evening shift.

[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:49.600]
So that will be perfect for you.

[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:50.220]
Perfect for you.

[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:52.960]
Perfect because I'm getting ready to crash and as I get home.

[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:53.480]
Okay.

[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:54.280]
Have a great day pal.

[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:54.620]
All right.

[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.180]
See there you go.

[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:56.660]
There we go.

[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:00.120]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60 and pound five, 60 on the AT.

[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.320]
Yeah we're peeing in our pants over here Pete.

[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.880]
Are we just don't know what we're going to do?

[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.220]
That's he knows he said he'd get even with me someday.

[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:12.180]
If it's the last thing he does he's get over going to get over a two share on someday part of it.

[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:13.020]
You think that's going to happen?

[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:13.280]
No.

[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.860]
No I really don't to be honest with you.

[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:18.400]
I just don't think you're going to get any gigantic numbers over there Pete.

[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.360]
At least there'll be somebody to you know to find Phil.

[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:20.740]
Okay.

[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:22.880]
But I just don't think you're going to get a big number.

[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:28.080]
And I don't think you're going to wind up selling tons and tons of a better than again they don't worry about that stuff you know.

[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:32.260]
Which is why they don't pay anybody anything over there or a queer channel.

[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:33.500]
Here's point and V.

[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:35.340]
Yeah Neil.

[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:35.920]
Yes sir.

[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:37.120]
Neil Goddard.

[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:40.860]
Listen I was calling I wanted to find out why don't you have an 800 number?

[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:46.440]
I don't have any very simple answer because I work for people who are a bunch of cheap pricks.

[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.720]
That's the answer.

[01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:50.140]
Neil I've got an 800 number here in my house.

[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:50.480]
Right.

[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:51.460]
And your house.

[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:57.920]
I have one at the office and it only cost six cents a minute and 15 second increment.

[01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:03.540]
So that means most of your calls usually run about 30 seconds to maybe never more than a minute.

[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:06.800]
Yeah but what about when you have people on hold?

[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.640]
Well all right so you're talking maybe 12 cents.

[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.660]
I was on hold for about four minutes.

[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:13.080]
Yeah.

[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:18.800]
Nobody you think there's a way around that and I've suggested to our program director who of course we spotted by going.

[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:19.540]
Yeah.

[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:23.480]
In fact when Larry King was on neutral when he was doing an awful nighttime show,

[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:28.380]
neutral and even as cheap as they were they had a 900 number and what they would do is they would let the phone keep bringing.

[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:32.180]
You do just keep bringing and then when the producer would pick it up just before they were going to put you on a year.

[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.900]
So you didn't have people on hold for a long time building up that gigantic bill and the expenses wouldn't be as great if you're worried about being cheap,

[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:38.920]
which these people are.

[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.360]
In other words if you really want to do it there's a way to do it without it being a major expense.

[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:44.140]
But these people don't want any expense.

[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:45.800]
Let's take a minute.

[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:52.060]
I mean in 15 second increments I mean a 30 second call is going to cost less than four cents.

[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:52.340]
Right.

[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:59.480]
So you have 100 you know and you've got to you should have some type of a budget with all of the viewers or listeners you have.

[01:02:59.700 --> 01:02:59.920]
Yeah.

[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:01.320]
We should have.

[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:07.500]
But who can I call there to show what kind of a thing I've got with the.

[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.940]
I wrote several people over here like to see what kind of a thing you've got.

[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:11.800]
Yeah.

[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.940]
No, but I want the program.

[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:16.300]
You might take a look at it and an 800 number.

[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:16.880]
Uh huh.

[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.920]
Who would I call there?

[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.500]
Call up a definitely the program director.

[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:22.500]
Duff Lindsay.

[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:22.900]
Yeah.

[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.980]
What's the phone number it is off?

[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:27.660]
Just tell them get off your duff.

[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.780]
What do you mean what's the phone number it is off?

[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.160]
Why do I call pound five 15?

[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.100]
That's for Duff Lindsay.

[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:33.620]
Yeah.

[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:33.860]
Call.

[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:36.340]
No.

[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:38.800]
What's the office number for this guy?

[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.260]
305.

[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:40.620]
305.

[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:41.540]
6353.

[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:42.620]
6353.

[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:43.400]
6796.

[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:44.780]
6796.

[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:46.540]
And what's the.

[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.140]
And I think it was really Duff Lindsay.

[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:48.540]
Yeah.

[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.260]
I just tell them get off your duff.

[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:51.000]
Yeah.

[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:52.380]
Okay, me.

[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:53.140]
Thank you, Pat.

[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:53.720]
Please.

[01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:54.840]
We need some assistance.

[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:55.420]
Thank you.

[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.720]
Now we got the audience going to bad for us trying to get us a guy they made a hundred lines.

[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.500]
So we can actually talk to a bunch of people which we need it.

[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.240]
I'm telling you desperately.

[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:02.800]
Look at this.

[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.600]
You think the fan ain't got a lot of calls.

[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.920]
I got two calls on the board.

[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.460]
I've been on here here 23 years.

[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:09.000]
We got a 90 share of the audience.

[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.720]
Even the smarts are all listening right now.

[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.260]
And we still can't get anybody to call.

[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:17.940]
And you wonder why they don't have any calls over there on 1790 on the AM dial.

[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.100]
And nobody can pick up areas.

[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:20.120]
That was your wondering right now.

[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:20.520]
You idiot.

[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.440]
A little fat puddle-wacking piece of dirt.

[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.540]
You in the cell.

[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:24.460]
Yeah.

[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.460]
A lot of what you say, Bobby is true, Neil.

[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:28.880]
Oh, man.

[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:37.320]
I'd like to put together a station with him and Angela Ray, Brian Norcross, Rick Sanchez.

[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.360]
Just call up the silly station.

[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:42.160]
All the silliest people that we can find.

[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:43.800]
Jim Barry.

[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:45.940]
Here's a mobile in Boker.

[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:46.240]
Hello.

[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:47.660]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.220]
The guy that you go to the games with.

[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:50.000]
Is that your boyfriend?

[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.540]
No, it's not my boyfriend.

[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:52.480]
Are you worried about that, Mitch?

[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:55.360]
Wouldn't you be at the game like a real human being, you jackass.

[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:56.960]
You asshole that we always see you alone.

[01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:59.120]
Is that because nobody will go to the games with you.

[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:00.840]
You'll imbecile you jackass idiot.

[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:03.760]
There's another great hockey call for you.

[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.100]
Oh!

[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:09.280]
5-6-7-0-5-60, pound 5-60 on the AT&T Rottles line.

[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.040]
Maybe he's jealous.

[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.460]
John said he ain't interested, by the way, Mitch.

[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:14.560]
He said you're an asshole.

[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:16.840]
Josh and I will stop it, stupid.

[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.280]
Coming soon from one star picture.

[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.780]
Combining the highest-grimbing tone ever, Titanic.

[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:26.420]
And one of America's greatest stories, Movedig.

[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.600]
Tommy Lee, Starzing, Titanic Dick.

[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.220]
Can I either of you think a white whale?

[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:35.360]
No, but I just saw this guy out on a boat with his girlfriend.

[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:38.480]
You should have seen that side of his shlaw.

[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:39.600]
Take me to hell.

[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:45.280]
As the boat sinks, Captain A. Hab tries desperately to videotape Titanic Dick in action.

[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:49.400]
Moving close by, my zoom lens only goes so far.

[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:52.680]
Why don't you just walk up to the front of the boat, a peg leg faster?

[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:53.220]
Titanic Dick.

[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:56.300]
I'm the other protection of the First Amendment.

[01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.840]
I feel your paper seeing.

[01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:00.560]
You should have just legal.

[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.160]
Playing now in BCRs across America.

[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:06.060]
By the way, here's a personal message to Keith Smith Jr.,

[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:09.840]
who's a chronic listener and a center of pornographic mail.

[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.060]
You're really sick, you know?

[01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:12.680]
I mean, desperately sick.

[01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:14.600]
Desperately, desperately ill.

[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:21.940]
For 20 some years now, for the last 100 years, this man has been sending me the most grotesque pornographic crap I have ever...

[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.320]
Nobody in the world would want to see.

[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.160]
But this morning he has really topped himself.

[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:27.080]
So the space.

[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:27.780]
Squirt, squirt.

[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:32.100]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T Wildest Line.

[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:35.080]
Anybody ever been first at the airport when you go through those medallic textures?

[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:35.840]
Uh-huh.

[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:36.620]
We all have.

[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:38.240]
Did anybody make a fuss about it?

[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:38.320]
No.

[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:39.220]
Only Diana Ross.

[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:41.660]
Because she's yesterday's news.

[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.820]
Because she's old, and tired, and worn out.

[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:48.000]
And she desperately needs a big, big splurter is what she needs.

[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:48.540]
The splurter.

[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:49.260]
Don't need to see that.

[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.380]
I wonder how much they paid off to put the heronier last night.

[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.440]
For the entire hour we got that.

[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:57.720]
He was first at the airport.

[01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.820]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:00.140]
Hello.

[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:01.240]
Hi Neil.

[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:01.780]
Yes sir.

[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:04.880]
I have to congratulate you on impeccable timing on your show.

[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.600]
I don't know if anybody mentioned this or not.

[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:10.420]
When Tom Glavin was pitching the other night against the Metts,

[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:16.420]
they pulled him in the seventh inning, and at the end of the inning he went over and gave his coach a little kiss on the cheek.

[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:17.980]
On National TV.

[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:19.260]
What's wrong with that?

[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.380]
Uh, a little grab ass in the dugout.

[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:22.260]
Maybe he's your opinion.

[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:24.060]
Could be.

[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.040]
No, they seem to like it.

[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:28.040]
So a little fraternity stuff going on.

[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.540]
Maybe Tom Glavin's in the grab.

[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:30.840]
Not could be.

[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:31.420]
That's it.

[01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:32.620]
Okay, thank you for the good news.

[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.860]
There you go on the Braves game, which by the way, how about those Braves?

[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:35.140]
Oh!

[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.660]
Kick the Metts three in a row.

[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:37.680]
How about that chipper Jones?

[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:37.980]
Oh!

[01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:38.960]
Do you want to talk about that?

[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:41.360]
Two calls left in the board.

[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.020]
Boy, I'll tell you, Barry, I think you got a point.

[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:46.380]
I think they're all down there with those two very entertaining guys at 17 under the dial,

[01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:47.760]
because I'm hearing from our sales department.

[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.120]
In fact, that's probably where all our live spots are gone, George.

[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.680]
They're probably doing them all down there at 17 under the fan.

[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:56.560]
Because I hear those two guys, they have to in the midday are tremendous.

[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.520]
And I mean, between them on the one side and Phil Henry in the middle.

[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:00.460]
I mean, we're out of business.

[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:01.120]
Let's face it.

[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:03.620]
You know, I mean, I'll take the money every two weeks, but we're out of business.

[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:04.080]
We're done.

[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:05.880]
Look at this response here, man.

[01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:10.380]
You know, you just have to be perspicacious enough to realize when your time is up,

[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:11.360]
when they call your number.

[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.700]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T line.

[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:16.920]
Here's the lady in pompano.

[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:17.180]
Hello.

[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:19.560]
Hello.

[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.400]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:24.140]
I just wanted to tell you why I think nobody calls.

[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:24.740]
Uh-huh.

[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.600]
Because you keep hanging up on everybody.

[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:27.960]
Uh-huh.

[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.620]
Anyway, my husband listens to me.

[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:31.740]
Did I hang up on the last guy?

[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:32.580]
No.

[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.000]
I'm a very impressed.

[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:36.000]
Anybody who has anything to say, I listen to him.

[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.720]
If they have nothing to say, I hang up on him because I'm supposed to be entertainment.

[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:43.040]
See, it's not unlike what Barry Jackass writes in his comments morning about how some of us are rude

[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.140]
and we don't suck up to the call.

[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:47.000]
It's supposed to be here for entertainment.

[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.480]
Not to give a demonstration of how to be polite.

[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:50.520]
That's true.

[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:52.100]
Okay.

[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.340]
Anywhere I just wanted to tell you.

[01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:55.180]
Tell me why.

[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.420]
What I thought.

[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:57.780]
Oh, why everybody calls?

[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:58.200]
Yeah.

[01:08:58.540 --> 01:08:59.300]
Okay, have a nice day.

[01:08:59.440 --> 01:08:59.580]
Bye.

[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:00.480]
Thanks for your critique.

[01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:01.120]
Okay, bye.

[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:02.480]
You hang up on everybody.

[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:02.900]
It's fine.

[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:04.140]
Nobody wants to talk to you, asshole.

[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.160]
Okay, thank you.

[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:07.440]
Unless I got something to give away.

[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:12.400]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:12.920]
Here's Miami.

[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:13.320]
Hello.

[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:15.660]
Miami.

[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:17.360]
Bob, I bully.

[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:18.240]
Okay, great.

[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:20.020]
In our last call, a day of mobile in Miami.

[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:20.400]
Hello.

[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:24.420]
Mobile in Miami.

[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.160]
Neil.

[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:26.120]
You're at, yes.

[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:27.880]
You're washed up, buddy.

[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:28.240]
Yeah.

[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.200]
Don't get to take you out.

[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:29.560]
Yeah.

[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:30.500]
Don't buy a house.

[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:30.900]
Okay.

[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:31.740]
You're washed up.

[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:32.560]
You had too much.

[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:33.660]
Okay, thank you.

[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:33.940]

[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:34.980]
Okay, thank you.

[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:35.600]
Go back to New York.

[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:36.360]
You had too much.

[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:40.660]
Thanks for listening to 560WQM as you do every day between 10 and 2.

[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:42.340]
And don't squeeze yourself too hard next time.

[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:42.920]
Okay, sweet art.

[01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:47.880]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless.

[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:49.320]
That was probably Pete Boulder's boyfriend.

[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:50.440]
If he asked me, I'd have liked it.

[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.520]
It sounded like he had a little problem in his rectum.

[01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:55.920]
Here's for a lottery deal.

[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:56.080]
Hello.

[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.120]
Hey, Neil.

[01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:57.640]
Yes, sir.

[01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:01.660]
A lot of these idiots out there don't realize that your show is just entertained.

[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:02.240]
Yeah.

[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.620]
And I think your show is so fucking entertaining.

[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:10.160]
And you can say it and you can say finish, but you can't say it.

[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:10.420]
Okay.

[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:14.800]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:15.940]
Here's a mobile and coconut creek.

[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:16.240]
Hello.

[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:17.440]
Now they're warming up to the task.

[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:17.740]
Hello.

[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:19.220]
Love you, Neil.

[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:19.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.460]
Oh, okay.

[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:23.360]
Here's for a lottery deal.

[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:23.520]
Hello.

[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.820]
They're warming up, but they don't have much material.

[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:27.660]
For a lottery deal.

[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:28.200]
Neil.

[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:28.800]
Yes, sir.

[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:29.200]
Hey.

[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.240]
54, brutal day.

[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:31.840]
Man, well.

[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:33.640]
You know, just they can take a look at us.

[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:34.660]
You know, they're under a lot of pressure.

[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.720]
Yeah, but you know, they got nothing else to do.

[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.400]
I mean, they, once you vote, they're losing.

[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:39.700]
They're pushing in.

[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:41.500]
They say they hate you, but they're listening.

[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:43.160]
It's, that's the bottom line.

[01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:46.960]
And when push comes to shove, you're still going to be at the top of everything.

[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:47.440]
Yeah.

[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:48.320]
You're the best.

[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:48.960]
Okay.

[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:49.260]
Thanks.

[01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:50.680]
I got nothing to talk about today.

[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.460]
I've mentioned all these different things.

[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:54.760]
I wasted all the time with very jackass this column.

[01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:56.560]
George Scott is dead.

[01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:58.880]
Anybody care about that?

[01:10:59.060 --> 01:10:59.200]
No.

[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:00.320]
He was a drunk, by the way.

[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.040]
Drunken and miserable nasty prick, like I said yesterday.

[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:04.920]
A great actor, but sometimes.

[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:07.740]
But in gigantic, enormous ego.

[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:13.620]
Big piece of newsweek, this magazine, this, this, this, this, this week magazine this week about Krispy Kreme.

[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.540]
See, I'm getting tongue-tock.

[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:16.060]
By the way, what are we getting for lunch today?

[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:17.940]
While we're talking to some more of these boats.

[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:18.920]
So that's worry about lunch.

[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:19.760]
Not worry about them.

[01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:20.340]
Screw them.

[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.040]
Like that bitch of the cost to tell me.

[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:25.620]
But if Asian people don't con you, the taxi is because you, did I hang up on her?

[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:25.900]
No.

[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:28.500]
And did she have anything to say?

[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:28.720]
No.

[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.000]
No, but I still don't hang up on her.

[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:30.620]
How do you like that?

[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.160]
Just unbelievable.

[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.940]
They all got that fucking bitch.

[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.260]
I'll critique, but they're all listening.

[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.200]
That's the amazing part.

[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.440]
Oh yeah, come on.

[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.000]
You know, Phil's gonna take you off, baby.

[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.220]
Is Phil gonna take me out?

[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:41.460]
No.

[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:42.920]
Is the wife gonna take me out?

[01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:43.180]
No.

[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.100]
Did Howard take us out between 10 and 11?

[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:45.500]
No.

[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.920]
Everybody in their brotherland did a large ass limbaugh take me out?

[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:50.140]
No.

[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.340]
To the ballgame.

[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:52.660]
And guess what?

[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.260]
I wouldn't go out with the ballgame, but he probably had all the goddamn winters.

[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.560]
Especially the ones that were in somebody's rectum.

[01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:58.820]
Like we heard about yesterday.

[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.280]
How about Atlantic City?

[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:02.820]
Yeah, that sounds real good.

[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:03.880]
Let's go there right now.

[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.400]
They have any direct flights?

[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.080]
Yeah, Atlantic City Sub sounds real good.

[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:09.640]
God, is that a great place over there in Hollywood?

[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:10.640]
Man, I'm telling you.

[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.160]
That is a spectacular place.

[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:13.240]
We love you guys.

[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.800]
Krispy Kreme Donuts, a tasty stock offering.

[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:17.700]
Bubba loves him.

[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:18.160]
How do you like that?

[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.640]
I'm gonna tell you one thing, by the way.

[01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:20.960]
I forgot to tell you how I'm sickest.

[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:24.960]
This president has told so many tall tales.

[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:26.400]
That's right.

[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:30.320]
That they even have a name for people to tell a story.

[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:31.160]
They tell tall tales.

[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.720]
They call them Bubba Micees now.

[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.560]
Could he have told so many?

[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:35.760]
Well, at any rate.

[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:37.520]
Probably all the Jews are in Shulah.

[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.900]
Do you go to Shulah on Sookers, by the way?

[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:40.240]
No.

[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:40.940]
Make sure you're hope not.

[01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:42.620]
Man, oh man.

[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:45.000]
How can you afford going to Shulah all these damn holidays?

[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.080]
In Simha Stora, all of these just jammed up back to back.

[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.040]
So at any rate, they're coming out public now.

[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.560]
Krispy Kreme, which I always thought was just down here.

[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:56.460]
I thought the one on 163rd Street there in North Miami Beach.

[01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:57.940]
I thought that was like a local thing.

[01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.960]
And come to find out.

[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.620]
They've got, let's see how many?

[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.560]
147 stores from New York to California.

[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:08.900]
And growing like crazy and going public on a stock market.

[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:11.420]
Which by the way, if you didn't find any stock that's going up these days.

[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:12.100]
Good luck to you.

[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:12.960]
Good luck to all of us.

[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:16.540]
Krispy Kreme, God, I only wish I could eat that.

[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:17.660]
You know, I wish we could just find.

[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:18.640]
Give me the magic pill.

[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:19.860]
Give me the magic cure.

[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:22.280]
And let me have all of the Ben and Jerry's in all the Krispy Kreme.

[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:25.620]
No fat, no diabetes, no sick, no any of that crap.

[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:26.120]
Please.

[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.920]
21 before noon at 5.60.

[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:29.440]
WQAM.

[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:31.060]
21 to noon at 5.60.

[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:31.920]
WQAM.

[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:32.940]
We got mad dog mad dog.

[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:33.040]
Yeah.

[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.360]
For Hank and two, Hank in Pittsburgh and Boston.

[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:38.060]
He's somewhere for the NFL this weekend for ESPN.

[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:42.620]
I get during the break two of the greatest faxes in the history of the human race.

[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:43.880]
Let me save the best for last.

[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.500]
This is a close second though from our good friend Eric.

[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:49.340]
Who does our web page up there in Orlando?

[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.760]
Nice going, Eric as usual.

[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:52.180]
Neoronjers.com.

[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.040]
It says Neil, I called Prime Co.

[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:58.380]
And the awkward plans again information on George's appearance.

[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:03.180]
I talked to three people there including a manager and no one knew anything about it.

[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:07.860]
What does Sam do exactly and do well?

[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.040]
Here's what I put on a website.

[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.500]
So Eric is actually put something on a website to promote your appearance.

[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:18.140]
George will be appearing tomorrow Saturday, September 25, noon at 2 p.m.

[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:18.940]
at Prime Co.

[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:23.440]
and 29, 10, awkward boulevard in the awkward plans in Hollywood for directions call.

[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.900]
And here's the number 9244433.

[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.580]
You'll be singing, dancing, giveaways and George.

[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:31.660]
We'll be looking for swing partners and do something with this sock puppet.

[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:34.060]
There you go.

[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:39.960]
A little promotion on our website from our good buddy Eric, which is more than we get from Gary Sarner and from Sam and the nephew here in this place.

[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:42.740]
Calls over there.

[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:44.580]
You're going to be there tomorrow from noon to 2.

[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:45.780]
Did they know anything about it?

[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:46.020]
No.

[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:47.620]
They probably don't even know you're coming.

[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:47.980]
No.

[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.040]
Nice going, Gary Sarner.

[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:54.460]
You idiot, you psychotic maniac, you lunatic.

[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:58.380]
God, but here is, I may frame this.

[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:04.260]
And I have to go back on my board because I said that I would not read another one of his taxes on the year.

[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.480]
But this and this will not be the last, by the way.

[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:07.780]
You can take that to the bank.

[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.800]
And wouldn't you know that it would be?

[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.220]
And of course I'm delighted because that red neck they called before.

[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.560]
I feel it's going to take you out.

[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:15.340]
That's what I'm looking for.

[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:16.280]
I'm delighted to hear that.

[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:20.120]
Good little spice going in this otherwise deadly boring town.

[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.400]
But here's the facts from Andy.

[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:28.020]
And after all this time we discover that it's Andy Rubenstein who works at Paul Gardner company in Palpat, Oveach.

[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.340]
That's Andy from Hollywood.

[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:37.860]
As in, oh, God, the most desperate of all desperate, the most chronic of all chronic, the most annoying of all the annoying.

[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:44.800]
The anxious, denosyating, the revolting, the puke inducing, Andy from Hollywood, who says,

[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:49.040]
direct to let you know that I'll be tuning into Phil Henry every day.

[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:54.520]
As you know, I'm a great fan of yours and Phil's since you are a bitter old van, I think it's time for a change.

[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:57.580]
On October 4th at 9 a.m., my radio will switch.

[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.700]
If you are lucky, if you are lucky, I may tune you in after Phil.

[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:08.520]
It has been quite a while since my radio has changed, but I will finally be happy and able to smile again.

[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.760]
It's been fun, but all good things must come to an end.

[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:12.660]
Andy.

[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:19.140]
Oh, that's a bad part.

[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:24.180]
I can only pray that it were true, but I know, of course, it's like all of the things they dangled in front of your face.

[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:25.560]
It's a lie, it's a tease.

[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:32.920]
Is there any chance that Andy will really, for any length of time, more than a few minutes, that he's going to turn off this program?

[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:33.200]
No.

[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.020]
No chance.

[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:37.640]
And I love that line.

[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:41.660]
It's been quite a while since I've been happy and able to smile again.

[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:47.060]
He'll finally be, isn't the guy that just got married by the way a few weeks ago.

[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:58.060]
But now he'll be able to smile and be happy again, because now he's got an alternative to subjecting himself to this God-awful show every day between 10 and 2.

[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:03.920]
This is almost like, this is almost that apart from the emancipation proclamation.

[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:07.360]
I would put it on that level if only it were true, like I said.

[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:10.840]
Only the difference being on the one that feels like I'm emancipated.

[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:14.140]
Oh, God.

[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.340]
Now if we could only get it, we could hook him up with Woody.

[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:20.220]
Can you imagine how fortunate we would with...

[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:22.040]
I bet your Woody likes Phil too, as a matter of fact.

[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.520]
Yeah, we're praying.

[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:26.000]
We're praying.

[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.480]
It's sookist that we're praying for you.

[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:28.480]
Okay, we're praying for us.

[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:29.560]
We're doing Hail Mary's.

[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:30.960]
We're laying our tephilis.

[01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:31.920]
We're squeezing it.

[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:33.900]
We're saying prayers for us.

[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:37.160]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:38.920]
We had the whole zillion calls on here, boy.

[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.780]
And as soon as we go to that break, it's goodbye time, baby.

[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:42.300]
Adios.

[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:43.720]
Here's Miami.

[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:44.080]
Hello.

[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:45.520]
Yes, sir.

[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:46.300]
Hey, Kepasa.

[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:50.980]
Just a moment, when I was surfing, you know, when the hurricane came.

[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:51.220]
Yeah.

[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:54.180]
Those porcus were given up the tickets.

[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:54.720]
Yeah.

[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.260]
They asked me for ID.

[01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:58.120]
I didn't have any.

[01:17:58.380 --> 01:17:59.020]
ID for what?

[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:00.940]
Oh, it's sookist that you can write you the ticket.

[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:03.980]
Yeah, so I gave them a bunch of false information and...

[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:05.060]
All right.

[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:05.460]
Great.

[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:06.640]
Ripped up the ticket.

[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:07.480]
As soon as they left it.

[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:08.100]
Nice go on, pal.

[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:08.420]
Excellent.

[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:09.640]
And it's looked fatty.

[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:10.480]
All right.

[01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:11.100]
Woohoo!

[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:11.860]
Okay, pal.

[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:13.040]
Hey, can I call someone a douchebag?

[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:14.360]
C.M.E. inside the Diana Ross.

[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:14.620]
Yes.

[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.200]
Eric Walker, you're a douchebag.

[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:16.480]
Okay.

[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:16.900]
Thanks, ma'am.

[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:17.480]
Don't do it again.

[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:18.960]
There you go.

[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:20.120]
Just leave everybody alone.

[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:20.480]
Okay.

[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.660]
We got all of this...

[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:22.080]
This...

[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.320]
Police state of ours.

[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.380]
Everything knows picking police.

[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.980]
That'll be next to knows picking police.

[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:30.780]
If they see a picking your nose with the wrong finger in your car, they're going to give you a goddamn ticket.

[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:39.440]
You know, if nobody has ever been first at an airport or any place else in this audience, I guess probably because most of these people never been anywhere.

[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:44.900]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:46.440]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:46.780]
Hello.

[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.120]
Hey, Neil.

[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:48.600]
Yes, sir.

[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:49.540]
How are you doing, sir?

[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:50.000]
Okay.

[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:50.880]
Hey, listen.

[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:57.740]
I just want to comment and let everybody know all those people that call you and say that, oh, that you say this and you say that, they have nothing else better to do.

[01:18:57.860 --> 01:18:59.240]
I mean, they're still listening, am I right?

[01:18:59.440 --> 01:18:59.620]
Yes.

[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:00.900]
I mean, so...

[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:04.740]
I just want to say I'm a recent listener and I enjoy your show and I think it's great.

[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.860]
And I look forward to what you got to say to all these douchebags.

[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:08.520]
Okay.

[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:09.360]
All right.

[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:10.260]
And have a great day.

[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:10.660]
Okay.

[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.240]
Thanks for the suck, Jack.

[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:14.500]
A little suckin' around the day.

[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:15.740]
They don't have too much material though.

[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:18.720]
They're not responsive to anything I'm talking about, including even Krispy Kreme donuts.

[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:19.620]
They don't care about that.

[01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:19.760]
Oh.

[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:20.660]
I can't imagine.

[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.720]
I mean, that's an emotional topic for anybody that's ever been there.

[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:24.500]
That got good stuff.

[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:25.340]
Good stuff.

[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:31.440]
And of course, we can promote them today because our friends from Dunkin' Donuts shine this this morning and didn't show up with the usual great breakfast that they do.

[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:39.140]
That they make that special ham and cheese and thing with me without the bread and the egg and all that cramp, which is delicious every Friday.

[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:39.800]
Look forward.

[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:41.360]
That's the only reason I come in usually on Friday.

[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:45.160]
Although today was payday, which is almost as great of motivation as Dunkin' Donuts being here.

[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:49.000]
I think that's the only reason I came in today because it was payday.

[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:53.000]
Because until we get this phone system going, I think I have to go out on strike.

[01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:56.060]
Here's a mobile and Davy.

[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:56.300]
Hello?

[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:57.680]
Hey, Aquaneel.

[01:19:58.800 --> 01:19:59.120]
Hello?

[01:19:59.400 --> 01:19:59.680]
Yes, sir.

[01:19:59.760 --> 01:19:59.920]
I'm here.

[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:00.660]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:02.280]
I thought you said mobile, but I'm not on mobile.

[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.480]
Here's a non-mobile and Davy.

[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:04.800]
Here's a stationary and Davy.

[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:05.460]
Stationery.

[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.060]
I want to talk to you about the guiding light.

[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:08.640]
All right.

[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:12.140]
But I have to tell you, I'm the way to work this morning.

[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:17.600]
I saw this guy on a motorcycle and on the back of his t-shirt, it said, if you can read this, the bitch fell off.

[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:18.200]
Okay.

[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:19.360]
That was pretty good, I thought.

[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:21.220]
Selena.

[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:32.640]
Someone told me that she was that old rock and roll party girl that used to hang out with all the rock and rollers like in the 70s.

[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.160]
Addie Darbinville or something like that.

[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:36.980]
I'll tell you a little bit about that detail out of me.

[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:37.800]
It's the holiday.

[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:38.640]
Maybe somebody will know.

[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.040]
By the way, you know the old Michelle on guiding light?

[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:41.560]
Yeah.

[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:45.500]
She's on some other soap opera now, either in general hospital or some ABC show, I think.

[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:46.600]
All my children.

[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:47.320]
Is that what it is?

[01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:47.920]
Thank you.

[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.260]
I thought she kind of looks the same as the other one.

[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:52.040]
I thought it was just a clone, maybe.

[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:53.280]
She's very annoying.

[01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:54.640]
She's extremely annoying.

[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.320]
No, no, the old Michelle, not the new one.

[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:57.160]
Not the new one.

[01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:59.220]
I'm the original Michelle, the real beautiful, the knockout.

[01:20:59.520 --> 01:20:59.840]
Oh.

[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:01.040]
She's on another show now.

[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:01.880]
All right, thanks.

[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:03.500]
But this new one, oh god.

[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.480]
This new one looks like Mariah Carey on a bad day with a smaller breath.

[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:07.780]
I'm very annoying.

[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.100]
I definitely pay more attention to the man than the one.

[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:10.880]
Okay.

[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:11.920]
And I was in a fraternity.

[01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:14.740]
And by the way, Billy, I sure hope they don't put Billy in the goddamn slamer.

[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:16.680]
Well, that could be interesting.

[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:18.520]
It could be like, ah, the need for the guiding light.

[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:18.980]
Exactly.

[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:19.860]
Talk to you later.

[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:20.560]
Okay, see you.

[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:22.220]
Oh, Billy, don't do it, Billy.

[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:23.780]
They got Billy cornered there on his pewter.

[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:24.720]
He's working on it.

[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:28.500]
And I guarantee you, he's watching the Jennifer Lopez.

[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.280]
5.670560, pound 5.60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:36.020]
Anybody out there like crispy cream?

[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:36.280]
No.

[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:37.920]
No, they don't even know where the hell it is.

[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:40.720]
Whatever happened to the people in this town.

[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.960]
You know, whatever happened to the real people they all, today I'll leave.

[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:45.800]
I think they all got chased out, you know.

[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:47.700]
They're Cuban's eat donuts.

[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:49.460]
Sure, what is it?

[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:51.760]
What would it mean?

[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:52.580]
Sure, why not?

[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:53.400]
Donuts are good.

[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:53.940]
Why wouldn't they?

[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:54.780]
I don't know.

[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.500]
You're always telling me about a whole different-

[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:59.740]
They have pizza, they have their own little things, but they don't eat those.

[01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:00.920]
Pat treat, little pat treat.

[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:05.900]
Oh, and by the way, that lunch yesterday, oh my God, that scallopini de polo from macaroni grill.

[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.400]
That was unbelievably good.

[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:15.780]
And you know something, it takes a lot for me to say that, even though they're going to be a sponsor on their station, but nevertheless, I wouldn't go so overboard because it's Gary Sarner's account.

[01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:21.900]
So unless it really was spectacular, I would have avoided repeating that, but we just so good, I have to, in spite of him.

[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:25.440]
Not because of him, but in spite of him and the way he screwed you on his appearance tomorrow.

[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:31.860]
By the way, George is going to be at tomorrow from to, here's Davy.

[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:32.120]
Hello?

[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:33.300]
Neil?

[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:33.840]
Yes, sir.

[01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:37.580]
Did you read a few recent years call, call today?

[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:38.800]
No, I couldn't find it.

[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:42.640]
It's in the Broward edition about Ken Jenny.

[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:43.520]
I got it right here.

[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.900]
It says, a rest violated right to right.

[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:46.460]
Is that the one?

[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:47.980]
Yeah, it's actually a pretty good article.

[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:51.480]
It's about the old guy who wrote...

[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.380]
Yeah, the old guy who wrote the anti-Semitic crap, yeah.

[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.000]
Right, well, he went to jail.

[01:22:55.880 --> 01:23:00.480]
And she's saying that basically Ken Jenny doesn't know anything about constitutional law.

[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:05.500]
She also talked about the end a little bit about how he went to the sex clubs,

[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.660]
and how he brags about these petty crimes, if they're even our crimes, that people are committing,

[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:13.480]
and basically just just going...

[01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:15.740]
You know, she's starting to make a lot of sense lately.

[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:16.460]
What happened to her?

[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:18.760]
Is she's written about three or four really good comms the last month?

[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.160]
Yeah, I mean, it's true.

[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:22.720]
Listen, I'm even Jewish, and I...

[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:23.520]
Oh, what?

[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:25.120]
It's your first amendment, right?

[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:25.560]
Right.

[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:31.760]
I mean, they try to get them under some very old state law that it's illegal to write anonymous...

[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:32.440]
Yeah.

[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:35.260]
Well, that's just Ken Jenny sucking up to the old Jews in Broward.

[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:36.000]
That's what he's all about.

[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:38.100]
It gets disgusting, you know.

[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:38.860]
Whatever happens.

[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.340]
Same thing with the sex clubs.

[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:44.060]
I mean, you know, it's not illegal, but everything wrong.

[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:45.200]
It went to a private club.

[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:46.500]
It's just...

[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:48.340]
They should go after the big hard crimes.

[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:52.000]
Let's go after the rapists, the killers, the robbers, the Steelers.

[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:53.520]
Yeah, but you see how it all ties in together?

[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:55.620]
Did I tell you that about Ken Jenny a long time ago?

[01:23:55.740 --> 01:24:01.040]
This man thinks that he's going to climb up the ladder by being Mr. Goody-Touchews, you know.

[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.060]
And it's not going to work.

[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:03.040]
It's going to blow up in the space.

[01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:06.140]
He's sitting here that he's doing this, I'm sure, you're right.

[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:07.760]
But he wants to run for mayor someday.

[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:08.780]
That's right.

[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:09.920]
There's no question about it.

[01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:10.380]
What city?

[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:12.460]
For Lauderdale, probably?

[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:15.420]
Okay, I hope that doesn't happen.

[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.540]
Keep him out of Davey, man.

[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:18.560]
Yeah.

[01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:20.440]
Put him on his horse and send him back.

[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:21.080]
And have a great day.

[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:22.480]
There you go.

[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:24.160]
Sue Risinger, thank you, sir, for pointing that out.

[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.020]
To me, it is a good call.

[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:29.500]
I'm sitting here reading it about this guy, this old guy, Lloyd Shank, who keeps writing the anti-submitted crap.

[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.500]
And he anonymous, but they knew it was him because he's been writing them for years.

[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:37.480]
And so Ken Jenny just throws the guy in jail.

[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:41.860]
And as she says, illegal is what Sheriff Ken Jenny did.

[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:46.640]
He arrested Shank in blatant violation of the man's First Amendment rights and held him behind bars for two weeks.

[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:52.960]
And Howard Finkelstein, as it points out, he was at the Democratic Club a couple of nights ago opening up his post.

[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:54.380]
And he was right on target about that.

[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:55.900]
Outrageous is what it is.

[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:02.340]
But when you got a sheriff who's a fascist, why is it that every time we get a new sheriff in Broward County, it's another fascist.

[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:03.540]
It's another guy, damn Nazi.

[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:08.720]
Every stink in time, we get somebody new up there. He's worse than anything else we ever had.

[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:10.400]
It's a lie. I am not, but not see.

[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:11.860]
Yeah, you should live so long, Ken Jenny.

[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:17.200]
Closing down, airy, I'm telling you, mark my words.

[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:20.700]
Just a matter of time, if he gets his way, he's going to be closing down.

[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:24.760]
Every guy, damn adult establishment in Broward County, because that's where he thinks it's at.

[01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:26.780]
He's going to be the Rooney, Julianne of South Florida.

[01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:31.800]
He's going to turn all of Florida, not just Orlando, he's going to turn all of Orlando into Disney World.

[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:40.860]
So the virginity police that we have only in selected parts of Broward County, they're going to be all over the place, inspecting your crotch.

[01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:46.100]
And if they see anything at Telltale sign, even if it's a goddamn Oscar-Mirowiner, you got a real tourist baby.

[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:51.100]
Why can't you just leave the people alone?

[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:56.260]
Why can't you just what kind of a government is it that just can't leave people alone?

[01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:00.900]
And that puts dangerous people back on the street again after they've been in there for a very short time.

[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:07.680]
And people who pose no danger to anybody, like the weed people with the weed police, they're in there for years, rotting away.

[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:12.320]
Because they had the audacity to light up the wicked weed.

[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:21.120]
Yeah, I'll tell you, weed does have, there is definitely like the reformad distinction, there's a definite association with insanity and marijuana.

[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:26.640]
And that is that the people who are arresting people for smoking it, growing it and selling it, those are the crazy people.

[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:29.900]
This is 560, UAL.

[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:36.640]
W-U-A-L, I'm at the sports body table.

[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:49.640]
We don't intermaker in the care of being.

[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:53.240]
They got the best herb that you ever seen.

[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:56.440]
All right, ask anybody in that table.

[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:00.780]
They tell you this is a country where the gun's a people.

[01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:04.520]
Raps the man has some he wants to sell.

[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:08.400]
And from a mile away, you can detect these smells.

[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:13.120]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke.

[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.840]
He light up the spliff and smoke.

[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:20.780]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke.

[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:24.380]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke.

[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:28.180]
They're gun to be good.

[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:34.820]
You can carry lots of herb in the gun, you can pack.

[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:38.860]
Smoke it every day until your lungs turn light.

[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:46.240]
With all the money that we have made, Jamaica doesn't need any foreign aid.

[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:53.180]
A marriage and tourist on the here and say, got nothing like this in the US.

[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:58.580]
They're smoke, smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke.

[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:02.240]
They light up the spliff and smoke.

[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:06.140]
They begin to puff and choke.

[01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:09.800]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke.

[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:13.540]
They're gun to be good.

[01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:20.100]
I'm the teller son, you are a rough stopman.

[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:24.000]
You like to smoke, you're just a stiff with every hit gun.

[01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:27.760]
Any people coming here for miles around,

[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:31.640]
fighting work for you by the ounce and dick gun.

[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:35.180]
Raster man, say to her, what am I right?

[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:39.940]
They're gun to be good tonight and then they smoke.

[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:43.780]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke.

[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.560]
They light up the spliff and smoke.

[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:51.360]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke.

[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.040]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke.

[01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:58.920]
They're gun to be good.

[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.500]
From 03 to 560 QAM.

[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:07.720]
And we got all the information on George's appearance at Prime Code of R between noon and

[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:08.220]
two in Hollywood.

[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:09.560]
They're going to be, yeah.

[01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:13.060]
Hey listen, go buy and see him and feel sorry for him.

[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:13.720]
Okay, help him out.

[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:15.260]
Oh god, it's great to see you here, George.

[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:16.280]
What are you going to be giving away?

[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.220]
He'll say, oh, yo, give it that look.

[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:22.440]
Just don't go there, freeloading, looking for something for free.

[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:26.000]
He'll go there and contribute something to his life and make him feel loved and wanted.

[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:27.320]
I'll be twirling like Shalala.

[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:30.680]
Make him feel like he's earning his money, whatever they're paying him over there tomorrow.

[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:31.500]
I wish you'd ate that much.

[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:37.400]
See, I realized Gary Sarner that being from our sales department, you don't understand the whole concept.

[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:39.300]
We were discussing this during the break, George and I.

[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:42.940]
The concept of actually doing something for the client when you take their money.

[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.160]
See, our sales department, that's alien.

[01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:46.240]
It's not in their vocabulary.

[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:51.040]
The idea of actually making somebody show up and bringing in some revenue for them and making it worth

[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:51.880]
while they spend the money.

[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:53.700]
There's no understanding of that.

[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.760]
There's no concept of that in the QM sales department.

[01:29:57.780 --> 01:30:03.540]
It's just that, you know, putting your red thumb detector in fines and people crazy enough to hand you over a bunch of money for nothing.

[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:08.180]
And we'll say, okay, take it.

[01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:10.460]
5, 6, 7, look at Sam.

[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:13.480]
He takes it to paycheck every couple of weeks for nothing.

[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:23.100]
I mean, seriously, if there's anybody in the world who gets paid for doing absolutely nothing, there's the man, which is why our promotions on a scale of,

[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:25.580]
is the big O. Nothing, zero.

[01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:28.640]
You can't complain about the promotions on this station because there aren't any.

[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:33.400]
We don't even have a guy with a sandwich board running up and down Lincoln Road Mall.

[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:35.720]
Here's Little Havana. Hello.

[01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:36.820]
Yeah, little.

[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:37.460]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:38.160]
How you doing, sir?

[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:38.580]
Okay.

[01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:39.600]
Okay. Yeah.

[01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:47.320]
I know nobody's touched base on this, but what do you think about the Herald's front page on the red neck in Texas?

[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:51.840]
You just got convicted for dragging that poor black man to death.

[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:52.840]
What do I think about it?

[01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:53.360]
Yeah.

[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:54.460]
What do you think about the sentence?

[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:57.160]
You got little injection and he's crying in the front page.

[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.360]
Yeah, he's crying tough crap.

[01:30:58.480 --> 01:30:59.200]
Yeah, I saw it on the news.

[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.620]
I say, fry his ass right now.

[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:02.340]
Take it, you got it.

[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:02.560]
Okay.

[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.520]
And then the other one, too, has got to go to trial the third one.

[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:05.780]
I say, fry them all together.

[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:08.780]
Of course, in Texas, they're a little bit more civilized than we are in some respects.

[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:12.220]
Oh, and did you see the thing on CBS News last night about the guns?

[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:13.540]
They're buying up guns.

[01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:15.000]
Like it's going out of town.

[01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:15.640]
You want to know why?

[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:17.020]
Because they're Y2K intensive.

[01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:17.820]
That's right.

[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:22.400]
All those crazy people, you know, the ones that hold up in the woods.

[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:24.040]
Yeah, they got all their ammo.

[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:24.940]
They're selling ammo.

[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:27.100]
And guns like record levels this year.

[01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:30.940]
And part of the reason being, they're getting ready for the disaster.

[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:34.520]
And all these prophecy books that have been written by crazy people,

[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:36.960]
being read by even crazier people with guns.

[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:40.800]
There's nothing like having a country where there's a bunch of crazy people armed to the teeth.

[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:44.480]
Like that asshole, our first call or yesterday.

[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.100]
Oh, yeah, the Democrats are evil.

[01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:47.380]
They want to take away my guns.

[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:51.240]
They're evil, all right, but not because they want to take away your guns.

[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.860]
They want to take away all our goddamn money.

[01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:55.160]
Miniac.

[01:31:56.340 --> 01:32:00.320]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:02.160]
I think we're just going to scratch all those spots.

[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:07.420]
You know, just so we can go through one day and see all the people stay on the line and not hang up.

[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:09.360]
Actually, we do get a lot of calls.

[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:11.440]
It's just that they don't stay on for more than five seconds.

[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:15.720]
Because every time they hear the second that there's an inkling that they might be,

[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:18.880]
because this station is conditioned the audience into commercial panic.

[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:22.280]
They have commercial anxiety that people listen to this radio station.

[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:26.920]
As soon as they, like I said, there's an inkling that there might be a spot.

[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:28.140]
Oh, they're running.

[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:31.860]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:33.660]
Any other quick things?

[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:34.060]
Yes, sir.

[01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:36.820]
Just so you don't say nobody talks about things you're talking about.

[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:37.640]
Christmasy cream donuts?

[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:38.100]
Yes.

[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:41.980]
When you go by, when the red light's flashing, that means the donuts are just coming out.

[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:45.820]
So if you go by early in the morning on the weekends, you get them piping hot.

[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:46.140]
Really?

[01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:48.020]
So hot, you can barely touch them in the other path.

[01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:48.920]
I never knew that.

[01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:49.720]
Oh, yeah.

[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:50.960]
They're piping hot.

[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.720]
You don't want to touch it too much, yeah.

[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:55.960]
There's a light that says, you know, fresh donuts, you know, like now.

[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:58.260]
And you can go and you can get them like right out of the fire.

[01:32:58.400 --> 01:32:58.900]
They're the best.

[01:32:59.100 --> 01:32:59.600]
Oh, right.

[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:03.240]
The other thing is, I've been frisked at an airport even in Brussels.

[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:07.740]
I was going through Brussels and not only when I went through the metal detector and you beat there.

[01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:08.120]
Right.

[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:10.040]
It's not like here where they make you go back again.

[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:13.060]
They put me against the wall because the machine does come off.

[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:16.520]
They frisk you and then they're like, okay, now you can go.

[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:16.740]
Right.

[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:18.360]
And you know, hey, it's just part of the security.

[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:18.600]
That's right.

[01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:22.400]
It's about security whether they just did it around with some little magic wand.

[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:24.040]
I mean, they, uh, they want to feel it.

[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:25.060]
They don't mess around.

[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:30.060]
And if you've been out of shape, Diana, because well, they felt under her breast, uh, I guess what, Diana,

[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:32.600]
how do you frisk somebody without feeling around all the body parts?

[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:33.580]
She should be happy.

[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:35.520]
She probably either had her breast felt in a long time.

[01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:35.920]
Exactly.

[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:36.960]
Who they would want to.

[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:37.480]
Right.

[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:40.600]
The other, the last thing is you're not kidding about salespeople being hassles.

[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:41.200]
A quick thing.

[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:44.940]
My girlfriend's a sales person for another radio station on the Spanish market.

[01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:48.700]
And they had like, uh, they were selling their spots at, you know, whatever,

[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.440]
$500 for 30 seconds.

[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:51.580]
Or something like that.

[01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:52.640]
And then they changed format.

[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:53.160]
Yeah.

[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:57.000]
And like some clients that spend like 30 or $40,000 on airtime.

[01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:00.240]
And now that they changed format, they're supposed to drop the prices.

[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:04.160]
And I asked, hey, so if you're going to get twice a year, she says, no, not screw them.

[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:05.000]
They don't know the difference.

[01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:05.760]
Yeah, there you go.

[01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:07.660]
And they just pop them for the full pop.

[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:08.200]
There you go.

[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:09.620]
That's the radio away in Miami.

[01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:09.980]
Sure.

[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:10.560]
You got it.

[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:11.120]
Yeah.

[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:12.020]
Anyway, you know, you're gone.

[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:12.500]
I love you.

[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:13.240]
I have a great day, pal.

[01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:13.640]
There you go.

[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:14.840]
One of our great calls of all time.

[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.100]
I actually had something to say.

[01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:20.840]
It says for lowly donuts, crispy creams have attracted a high-powered following.

[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:25.000]
President Clinton had been delivered regularly to the White House until his fitness advisors heard about it.

[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:26.500]
He used to eat them by the box.

[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:28.440]
Yeah.

[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:30.280]
They're really like Pringles potato chips.

[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:32.200]
Crispy cream donuts.

[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:34.560]
You can't eat only one or two or three.

[01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:36.300]
Because they're kind of small.

[01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:37.200]
Oh, no, seriously.

[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.480]
You get them in that box and you just shovel them down.

[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:42.220]
With all due respect to our friends at the Dunkin' Donuts,

[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:44.380]
that'll teach them to shine us this morning or any Friday.

[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:48.460]
And if you have the munchies, the box goes in like 30 seconds.

[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:49.100]
Oh, yeah.

[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:50.860]
Then you have to play with it.

[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:51.940]
Oh, no, why did I start this?

[01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:53.040]
Why do I even see that thing?

[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:53.800]
If you had any idea.

[01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:55.980]
And then you know somebody's going to send some over here or something.

[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:56.200]
No.

[01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:57.440]
Not today.

[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.660]
Nine minutes after noon at 5.60 WQM, let me...

[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:08.800]
Welcome to the drive-through window, May.

[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:13.560]
I take your order, please.

[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:16.600]
Yeah, I'll take a double cheeseburger, no onions.

[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:23.840]
Would you like some French fries with that burger?

[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:26.120]
Yeah, and large coke.

[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:32.640]
Regular or diet, regular or diet, regular or diet, please.

[01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:33.660]
Regular.

[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:35.340]
How much is that going to be?

[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.340]
You, you, oughta know.

[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.040]
Drive it to the window, please.

[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:43.660]
From our music, CKLW.

[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:45.660]
Yeah, let's get those CKLW jingles on.

[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:47.160]
I was so depressing with a guy called yesterday,

[01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:49.380]
I said that they were shutting the station off the year.

[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:50.140]
How do you like that?

[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:53.080]
I wonder how long before they shut 1700 off the year,

[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:54.040]
probably not too long, Barry.

[01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:55.900]
5.60, of course.

[01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:56.820]
What am I talking about?

[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.460]
I'm losing my good friend, Andy, from Hollywood.

[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:00.240]
Yeah.

[01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:02.760]
We got the two live juzon there at 17.

[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:05.160]
Remember we got Phil coming in the morning, at least a couple hours.

[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:06.080]
Overlapped.

[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:09.680]
I'm losing my best post-loyalist, the listener, Andy, from Hollywood.

[01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:11.500]
I think the end is in sight, baby.

[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:12.780]
You can smell it.

[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:13.140]
Can't you?

[01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:14.480]
For about a million miles away.

[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:15.320]
You can feel it.

[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:16.380]
You can squeeze it.

[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:22.020]
So don't go alienating Woody next time, because he's about all we got left.

[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.520]
5.60, 7.05, 60.

[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:27.220]
Pound 5.60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:28.860]
Here's Miami.

[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:29.180]
Hello.

[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:32.160]
Neil, as long as you've been around, why are you so immature?

[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:34.380]
Why can't you have a real show like, uh,

[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:35.820]
I don't like, like, uh, yeah.

[01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:37.580]
Then why can't you find one to listen to, pal?

[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.240]
Because you're, uh, another one with little Cuban buddies there.

[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:42.840]
So you can do that.

[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:44.080]
He's squeezing it.

[01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:45.180]
Uh-oh.

[01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:46.040]
Squirt, squirt.

[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:47.120]
Couldn't have been him.

[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:49.960]
5.60, 7.05, 60.

[01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:52.280]
Pound 5.60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:53.580]
It's so, so sad.

[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:57.960]
That where we have 14 million Cubans in this town, and we have like maybe three of them,

[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:01.240]
and actually have something to say that can converse, that can hold a conversation,

[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:04.440]
that has something to say that might be interesting, humorous, uh, whatever.

[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:05.340]
Worth a while.

[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:06.800]
I think worth a while is the word.

[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:08.320]
And anyway, shape or form.

[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:11.220]
And the rest, it's a little, it's a little, uh, gag of my mind.

[01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:11.800]
I'm gonna put it in my deconies.

[01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:14.520]
5.60, 7.05, 60.

[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:16.860]
Pound 5.60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:17.280]
Yeah, Woody.

[01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:19.580]
Like I said, we don't want to talk to him ever.

[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:21.900]
Here's Pemberpine.

[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:22.220]
Hello.

[01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:23.380]
Hello, Neil.

[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:23.900]
Yes, sir.

[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:28.820]
I was reading in the morning, when you have times that Perot is gonna support Buchanan.

[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:30.020]
Let me ask you.

[01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:31.820]
Yeah, so let me ask you a question.

[01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:33.160]
Buchanan gets elected.

[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.380]
Who goes through the gas chain this first?

[01:37:35.540 --> 01:37:37.080]
The Jews, the blacks, or the gays?

[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:37.660]
Uh-huh.

[01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:38.960]
Well, that's my question.

[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:39.500]
What do you think?

[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:41.580]
I think Ross, I think short people like Ross Perot.

[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:43.340]
I think that's a good idea.

[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:43.920]
Yeah, okay.

[01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:46.220]
5.60, 7.05, 60.

[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.040]
Pound 5.60 on the AT.

[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:48.940]
This is another thing.

[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:49.560]
We're supposed to talk.

[01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:52.900]
We might have a chance because in Jesse the body ventura in this before party.

[01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:54.400]
We really thought there might be a chance.

[01:37:55.460 --> 01:38:00.040]
And then of course, it looks like Buchanan's gonna be the candidate because Peabro's still got all the strings.

[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.080]
Because he's the $1 money.

[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:07.360]
You know, uh, Ross, uh, Pat Buchanan who says, well, we misunderstood Hitler.

[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:09.140]
Maybe we shouldn't have gone to war in the first place.

[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:11.640]
And let the Jews control the country.

[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:12.480]
That kind of good stuff.

[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.100]
Nice going, Pat.

[01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:14.000]
Oh, again.

[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:17.300]
5.60, 7.05, 60.

[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.440]
Pound 5.60 on the AT&T line.

[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:20.640]
Here's a mobile and bell-glaed.

[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:20.900]
Hello.

[01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:22.120]
Hey, Neil.

[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:22.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:30.580]
I was just kind of applaud you on your awareness of how tax money has been spent for these glorious, uh,

[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:33.220]
80s and whatever going on in Miami.

[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:34.960]
I'm in Palm Beach County though.

[01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:37.480]
And I just want to let you know.

[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:39.480]
New table will never print that.

[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:42.220]
And I appreciate it.

[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:42.480]
Okay.

[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:44.160]
And have a great life.

[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:46.340]
This paper we never print what?

[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:46.700]
Do we know?

[01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:48.780]
No, no, no, don't ask questions.

[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:49.580]
Just keep moving along.

[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:51.380]
Okay, just keep rolling along, singing the song.

[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:53.120]
5.60, 7.05, 60.

[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:55.280]
Pound 5.60 on the AT&T line.

[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:56.340]
Here's a mobile and Miami.

[01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:56.680]
Hello?

[01:38:57.620 --> 01:38:58.060]
Neil.

[01:38:58.280 --> 01:38:58.560]
Yes, sir.

[01:38:59.040 --> 01:38:59.540]
How you doing?

[01:38:59.540 --> 01:38:59.960]
Okay.

[01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:05.900]
Listen, I did you see today on the newspaper 22 people got busted in Grand Elf Park touching each other?

[01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:06.200]
No.

[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.180]
Yeah, true to them were priests.

[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:09.540]
Yeah.

[01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:11.460]
And I'm in Grand Elf Park, guys.

[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:12.340]
It's not that fabulous.

[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:14.240]
Okay, thanks.

[01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:15.000]
Thanks for the good news.

[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:18.080]
Okay, here's our last call for Lauderdale.

[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:18.340]
Hello.

[01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:18.920]
Hello, Neil.

[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:19.420]
Yes, sir.

[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:22.600]
So that's amazing news that they're going to put on the other station.

[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:25.540]
They're going to put tape in the middle of the day.

[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:26.040]
Yeah.

[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:26.660]
Against you.

[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:28.180]
Well, it's better than Dr. Laura.

[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:28.960]
Mm-hmm.

[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:31.600]
And they'll have to fill live at night.

[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:32.100]
Yes.

[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.680]
I used to listen to Emma on the internet.

[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:36.900]
So it would be good to actually have them on.

[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:38.140]
Well, she has one advantage.

[01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:40.120]
And of course, when you're on tape, you really don't have to do anything.

[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.040]
But she's got one advantage that he talks to himself.

[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:43.300]
He doesn't have to rely on phone calls.

[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:46.980]
Because anybody needs to rely on phone calls in this market unless they do in the sports third show.

[01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:48.200]
They might as well forget it.

[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:49.540]
Because that's, yeah.

[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:51.000]
So it should be very interesting.

[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.060]
It should be really interesting.

[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:56.420]
I think what I'm going to do is probably on it because I got a little radio in here and during the break since we got all these spots.

[01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:58.100]
I'll listen to feel like from 10 to noon.

[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:01.640]
In between the show and between the four or five calls we get.

[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:02.420]
Yeah.

[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:03.900]
So and also...

[01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:05.740]
You could just silence cast might not be a bad idea.

[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:07.240]
That's an idea.

[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:13.620]
Oh, George, you can tell George, well, that there's swing clubs all over the state.

[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:14.380]
Yeah.

[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:16.560]
That he should check out.

[01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:21.580]
And I hope to see George and Crystal at what are new places.

[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:23.600]
You don't want to see him.

[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:24.320]
What?

[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:25.440]
I said have a great day.

[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:27.900]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:28.740]
See what I tell you?

[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:31.800]
George is using the show as a conduit to finding a bunch of other perverts out there.

[01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:32.880]
That's what it's turned into now.

[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:34.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:35.000]
Yeah.

[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:37.580]
Yeah, he wants to see you when Crystal naked is what he's saying going.

[01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:39.340]
And he really don't care about her too much.

[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:40.100]
I think is what he said.

[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:44.280]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 and 0, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:45.820]
One line left that aboard and that's it.

[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:46.760]
Then we say, bye-bye.

[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:47.560]
See ya.

[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:48.640]
Here comes the music.

[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.420]
Punch up that much music.

[01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:53.140]
There you go.

[01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:55.020]
Thank God we got that thing all hooked up there.

[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:59.380]
Thank God for our friends that brought us that satellite dish and Jeff Cohen with the TV set almost two years ago.

[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:00.360]
That's all we got.

[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:02.420]
Here's Miami.

[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:02.760]
Hello.

[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:05.020]
Yeah, let's talk Ryder Cup cough.

[01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:06.660]
Yeah, look, do you like Freddy Cup?

[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:07.120]
No, it's not.

[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:08.060]
Okay, there's it.

[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:09.900]
There's your last call of the day.

[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.700]
Paul, call up that 1700, baby.

[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:12.200]
Come on.

[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:13.140]
You got a sport.

[01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:14.480]
You got a great niche there.

[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:16.600]
You got the non-sports show here, man.

[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:17.200]
Wrong show.

[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:18.360]
Call up 1700.

[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:20.560]
Make your very jackass feel good.

[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:24.120]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:24.980]
Let me say it again.

[01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:32.900]
The nature of the people who call these sports shows and just like this guy who thinks he's being funny, but nevertheless, that would be the kind of call that you would hear on those shows.

[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:41.000]
Those people, I just look in the mirror and I ask myself, how can there be people like this who really are interested in these things?

[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:43.380]
Who thinks that anybody cares about these things?

[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:45.200]
God.

[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:47.360]
Here's a mobile implantation.

[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:48.100]
Hello.

[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:49.200]
You're in the toilet.

[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:50.400]
They're okay, great.

[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:53.600]
But they're all still, you see, why do you waste your time?

[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:55.000]
I'm getting stale.

[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:56.380]
My material is stale.

[01:41:56.580 --> 01:41:58.420]
They show stuff and you're glued to it.

[01:41:58.600 --> 01:41:59.900]
You're stuck to it like glue.

[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:03.880]
And no matter who they put, could put God on it and you're still going to be listening to.

[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:04.560]
Now God.

[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:05.760]
Who the hell are you kidding?

[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:06.680]
You're not fooling me.

[01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:08.340]
You're not fooling anybody in the audience.

[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:10.280]
You're with IQ larger than their toenail.

[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:13.520]
Everything is getting stale like last year's hall of a.

[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:16.640]
The only thing that's stale is old farts like you, sir.

[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:18.060]
That's real stale.

[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:21.720]
That's what keeps this such a dreadful deadly goddamn place to live.

[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:25.500]
Old stale miserable bitter farts like you.

[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:31.960]
Who haven't had a goddamn bowel move before God didn't imagine coca was a baby.

[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.380]
Before Martha Ray had real teeth.

[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:36.680]
Here's Helen Dale.

[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:36.940]
Hello.

[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:37.900]
Hey, Dale.

[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:38.380]
Yes, sir.

[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:38.840]
How you doing?

[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:39.180]
Great.

[01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:39.800]
All right.

[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:40.920]
First time in a long time.

[01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:41.760]
All right.

[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:44.700]
I was wondering if you had any recent like best of nail stuff?

[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:46.520]
Starting October 1.

[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:47.740]
October 1.

[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:48.440]
W. It's specs.

[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:49.320]
It's specs?

[01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:49.800]
Yep.

[01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:50.380]
Okay.

[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:50.940]
You're God now.

[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:51.520]
Okay. Thanks.

[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:51.820]
Love you.

[01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:52.640]
That's right.

[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:55.340]
Our center 1 campaign begins October 1 at specs.

[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:58.020]
They'll be in 17 specs stores all over Dave Broward and Palm Beach.

[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:00.620]
And by the way, anybody asks us and I'll try to work on it.

[01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:03.000]
See if we can get it over there in Fort Myers since they have a specs over there.

[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:04.160]
And we have the list.

[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:06.180]
That would be a good idea.

[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:09.740]
Just in time too, by the way, because you know, but another three, four weeks will be out of

[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:10.940]
business over here with this crowd.

[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:13.140]
Here's Fort Myers.

[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:13.440]
Hello.

[01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:15.500]
Oh.

[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:16.360]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:18.400]
I just want to say a new listener.

[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:21.100]
I love your show and I can listen to it all day.

[01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:21.540]
Great.

[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:22.200]
Thank you.

[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:22.680]
Thank you.

[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:22.840]
A lot.

[01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:23.380]
Thanks, pal.

[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:25.560]
See you don't want to talk too long because he's paying for it.

[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:27.180]
He calls on his dime.

[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:27.860]
Thank you, sir.

[01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:28.600]
God bless you.

[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:29.560]
We'll pray for you.

[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.780]
Because he's spending his time to call us because we work for him.

[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.380]
I'm so glad we're on in Fort Myers.

[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:38.440]
Not just because we've got a few people listening over there, but because the bees

[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:41.380]
are in the trees, over there in Naples, can pick it up loud and queer, okay?

[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:47.620]
And because unlike some of the sucklings we got around this place, I'm the one that's got the balls to tell you what

[01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:50.720]
I want you to cheap, cheap, unbelievable bastards they are.

[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:53.260]
They won't even put in a goddamn toll-free number.

[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:55.640]
So people like this last guy, I got to pay to call us.

[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:58.200]
How many people are going to pay to call a goddamn talk show?

[01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:04.580]
And then sit on hold and wait for 22 minutes while their meter is running for the honor of being on there for a minute or two.

[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:08.820]
Or like the broad that bitch said before, oh, you hang up on everybody anyway.

[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:10.580]
Why would they want to talk to you?

[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.300]
Hmm, God.

[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:15.800]
You know, it's just amazing what you could do with a crowbar.

[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:19.420]
How much better you can feel about life?

[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:21.900]
Here's a mobile and store it. Hello.

[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:23.380]
Yeah, how you doing now?

[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:23.980]
Pretty good, sir.

[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:26.960]
Hey, look, you don't have any friends at all in the head station because you know what?

[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:30.160]
Here in Stewart, there's a head station and has a food outlet.

[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:34.580]
On one side is a Godfather's Pizza and on the other side is a crispy cream donut.

[01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:35.280]
Oh my God.

[01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:35.580]
Wow.

[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:39.020]
So they were thinking of you on the other side.

[01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:41.280]
On one side and crispy cream on the other side.

[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:41.740]
Yes, sir.

[01:44:42.100 --> 01:44:44.180]
Oh my God, they'd have to carry me out in the goddamn way.

[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:46.060]
Thanks for the good news, pal.

[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:46.460]
Okay.

[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:48.140]
And once you showed up, by the way.

[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:48.660]
Okay.

[01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:49.300]
There you go.

[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:51.440]
Oh my God.

[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:56.140]
Thanks to our good friends at Atlantic City Sub's again for bringing us a fantastic again for the eight million time.

[01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:56.860]
You're the best, baby.

[01:44:57.100 --> 01:44:57.720]
We love you.

[01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:02.540]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:04.700]
Godfather's Pizza.

[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:05.340]
Gone.

[01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:08.220]
Thank God for crispy cream.

[01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:08.700]
That's been here.

[01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:10.520]
I don't wonder how long that place has been there, by the way.

[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:11.940]
And that egg place.

[01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:12.480]
What is it?

[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:13.020]
What is the place?

[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:16.100]
The omelet, the egg, the ham and egg green next door.

[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:17.120]
Those two things.

[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:20.740]
I mean, that's about all that's left in North Miami Beach.

[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:21.920]
There aren't any more white people there.

[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:22.060]
No.

[01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:25.780]
But that's the only two things we got left in North Miami Beach is crispy cream donuts.

[01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:27.480]
And the ham and egg green right next door.

[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:29.520]
They've been here since before I was here.

[01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:31.000]
23 years at least, that means.

[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:32.680]
Corkeys used to be right there.

[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:34.020]
Corkeys used to be right there.

[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:34.840]
Is corkeys there anymore?

[01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:35.080]
No.

[01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:35.660]
Along gone.

[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:37.100]
See, what did I tell you?

[01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:41.820]
The day that corkeys disappeared, that was the day they put the last nails in the coffin in North Miami Beach.

[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:43.760]
How sad.

[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:46.760]
How tragic.

[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:47.680]
What did I used to love?

[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:49.400]
Those little potato pancakes of corkeys.

[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:50.040]
Mmm.

[01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:52.520]
And that parking lot was jammed, baby.

[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:55.080]
It was jammed, it was loaded, it was packed.

[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:57.280]
They were packing it.

[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:03.540]
And then all of a sudden for someone who announced the reason the neighborhood started changing and everybody said,

[01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:04.840]
Oh, we're moving.

[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:05.920]
See ya.

[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.240]
Here's a mobile and lake worth.

[01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:08.460]
Hello.

[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:10.220]
Hi, how you doing?

[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:10.540]
Great.

[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:13.640]
Little spy report from 17 trillion on the dial.

[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:14.100]
Yes, sir.

[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:15.220]
Here's somebody that's heard it.

[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:19.880]
Yeah, I have the amplifier on my radio so I can pull it in.

[01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:22.940]
They were talking about Barry Jackass' article.

[01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:23.800]
Yeah.

[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:29.380]
And they said, any advertisement is good advertisement, good or better and different.

[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:33.340]
And how that fills tapes on a knock your audience off.

[01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:34.040]
Oh, yeah.

[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:34.800]
All right.

[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:36.880]
But that's what they were talking about.

[01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:37.280]
Uh-huh.

[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:39.480]
What does that have to do with sports?

[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:40.700]
Oh, please.

[01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:42.580]
I thought they had a sports show.

[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:44.560]
One of those two group balls talk about it in the midday.

[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:47.020]
I've never heard anybody say that they even do a sports show.

[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:51.120]
Well, I was trying to do an amateur sit-down comedy show like Christina Moore.

[01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:55.300]
I listened for about five minutes and then I just couldn't even bear it anymore.

[01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:57.060]
Okay, thanks for the good news.

[01:46:57.180 --> 01:46:57.520]
You're welcome.

[01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:58.060]
Thank you.

[01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:00.260]
Yeah, they're worrying about my numbers over here.

[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:00.720]
Guess what?

[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:01.640]
You guys got any numbers?

[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:02.120]
No.

[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:03.540]
They got the big...

[01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:07.220]
Well, wait and see when those numbers come out on Monday by the way we got another trend coming out.

[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:12.140]
We'll see if they got any number, which I have a feeling it's going to be a big, fat, round number.

[01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:17.000]
I mean, you know, you have to start scratching your hands.

[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.540]
And you're wondering of certain people at certain newspapers around the take when they start writing stuff like that, you know?

[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:23.580]
I'm not mentioning any names, of course.

[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:24.960]
We have to start wondering about that.

[01:47:25.060 --> 01:47:27.800]
I'm not making any accusations, but you have to wonder like, out loud.

[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:30.080]
Just desperate.

[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:31.940]
As in...

[01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:32.640]
Don't be 50 dollars.

[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:34.580]
1226 at 560 QAM.

[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:36.740]
Friday, you best.

[01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:41.420]
Good orgy bushes at his noses clean and never puts up in it.

[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:45.240]
Because he's running for the White House, so he took 10 minutes.

[01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:50.080]
Don't drunken that's not all even down a few people.

[01:47:50.180 --> 01:47:54.220]
In college, Andy, Drunk with Doohy, and Drunk with the Mastas too.

[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:58.120]
Why won't George just come out and simply say he did it?

[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:00.460]
He preferred the bread, which shut their mouth.

[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:02.180]
But if any of you got them business.

[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.100]
He did more than what you think.

[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:06.260]
So he watched it down the sea.

[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:08.200]
And he preferred cocaine to have.

[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:10.420]
That's the question that he does.

[01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:12.560]
And he make his point much clearer.

[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:14.720]
Like a razor on a mirror.

[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:17.020]
Like he wants the tube in the...

[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:18.680]
That he didn't do anything.

[01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:20.520]
George, Bush with the Mastas.

[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:22.880]
Don't drunken that's not all even down a few people.

[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:25.600]
He's running for the White House.

[01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:28.080]
He just came to me with George's cream.

[01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:29.160]
George's cream.

[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:33.460]
1231 at 560 WQM.

[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:34.980]
We got the Mad Dog gym manager for Hank.

[01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:35.520]
Yes!

[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:36.460]
To the sector, no.

[01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:37.500]
We got the gym name.

[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:38.660]
We could be really special.

[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:39.420]
We could be something.

[01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:40.260]
We could be a pilot.

[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:41.660]
Johnson, show a five.

[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:43.360]
Talking baseball with Donnie.

[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:46.580]
We could be a six-hundred pre-game and then the Iraqis in the Marlin stuff.

[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:48.080]
Oh, thank God it's almost over.

[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:48.780]
Thank God!

[01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:52.500]
Here's a call from Boston on your dime.

[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:53.680]
Hello, Neil.

[01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:54.120]
Yes.

[01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:55.360]
I'm calling from Boston.

[01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:57.720]
It was near on the internet every day.

[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:00.900]
I'm soon actually moving away from today down to Fort Lauderdale.

[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:03.300]
Moving myself and my company and all that stuff.

[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:04.240]
So I can listen to you live.

[01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:04.920]
Oh my God!

[01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:06.160]
Even though you're alive.

[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:08.640]
Anyways, I'm a big fan of crispy cream myself.

[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:13.840]
There's one in sunrise that I visit all the time usually about three in the morning.

[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:15.000]
There's one in sunrise?

[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:15.700]
Yes.

[01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:17.180]
I think it's sunrise.

[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:19.360]
It's right above where my friend lives in sunrise.

[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:23.800]
It's in the most remote location you can ever imagine and they never get your order right.

[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:26.780]
Anyways, I'm opening a new store.

[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:32.800]
Hopefully I just heard you talk about adult products down there and I'm opening an adult store of all places in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:33.660]
In Broward County?

[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:34.420]
Yeah.

[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:35.060]
Oh boy.

[01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:40.640]
I was open to it when I was living in Wilking Manors but they don't allow that stuff I found out.

[01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:43.320]
Not even the elongated toy things.

[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:46.080]
Those are actually illegal to own in that area.

[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:51.640]
Anyways, and my store will be right across from the crispy cream in Fort Lauderdale,

[01:49:51.740 --> 01:49:54.420]
which is about an A1A or something like that.

[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:54.840]
A1A, yeah.

[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:56.340]
No one's that A1A.

[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:57.940]
It's on Route 1, whatever they call it.

[01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:58.480]
The US1.

[01:49:58.780 --> 01:49:59.620]
Right by the sports authority.

[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:01.880]
Yeah, you obviously got a good grasp on the area.

[01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:03.360]
Well, come on now.

[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:04.100]
I'm down there all the time.

[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:06.260]
Anyways, I hope to see you when I get down there.

[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:06.660]
Okay.

[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:07.340]
Thanks a lot.

[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:08.660]
And have a great life.

[01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:09.960]
Oh, there's a guy that's going to be sorry.

[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:13.480]
Sounds like a decent guy, but I'll be sorry.

[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:15.540]
Better watch out Ken Janay.

[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:15.920]
They're coming.

[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:20.200]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:26.860]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:29.080]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:29.400]
Hello.

[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:31.000]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:31.760]
Okay, sir.

[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:35.540]
You know, the guy from Boston talking about the adults, but that makes me wonder.

[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:36.760]
Have you been to the Gady lately?

[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:41.200]
Yeah, I'm standing outside waiting for it to reopen.

[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:43.760]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:44.020]
Hello.

[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:46.200]
Hey, and you see even hell.

[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:49.240]
What was it?

[01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:50.180]
See you in hell.

[01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:51.460]
Oh, see you in hell.

[01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:52.540]
Okay, I see you there, pal.

[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:53.880]
I'm having a good lunch by myself.

[01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:54.660]
Good free lunch.

[01:50:57.460 --> 01:51:00.980]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:02.520]
You know something who cares?

[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:06.980]
Got a big, big fat check in my pocket.

[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:11.020]
Nice big free lunch sitting here from our friends in the Atlantic City Sub.

[01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:12.360]
Life is sweet, baby.

[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:17.360]
The most hateful, the most sour, the most bitter.

[01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:22.100]
As long as I got my buddy Andy from Hollywood, nobody can screw with me.

[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:23.000]
I'll tell you that right now.

[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:29.360]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:32.960]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:33.240]
Hello.

[01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:34.080]
Hey, dear.

[01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:34.740]
Yes, sir.

[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:37.340]
There is a crispy cream right near you.

[01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:39.680]
Don't even tell me.

[01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:40.220]
Yes.

[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:42.900]
It's a nobler in McNair.

[01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:45.480]
Well, that's not that close to me, you know.

[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:46.560]
It's a nice one, yeah.

[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:47.540]
Not too big.

[01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:48.940]
It's not far from you at all.

[01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:50.900]
Yeah, I'm not, I can't eat donuts.

[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:52.180]
Believe me.

[01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:54.400]
I know, but anyway, don't mind the kid, yes.

[01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:55.680]
Okay, thanks for the bad news.

[01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:57.500]
I must be the one that guy's talking about.

[01:51:58.140 --> 01:52:00.120]
The guy that's going to open up a porno joint in Ken Jenny,

[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:01.340]
I'll shut him down in about five minutes.

[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:02.860]
No, no, it's around begging you.

[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:03.720]
You'll be sorry.

[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:09.100]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:10.000]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:10.300]
Hello.

[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:11.980]
I need you, how you doing?

[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:12.540]
Okay, sir.

[01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:16.180]
The crispy cream on Federal Highways right next to J Alexander's.

[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:17.580]
I love the blocker.

[01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:19.540]
We've got to put the state down in that area, yeah.

[01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:25.820]
Like a double story, what I listen to paternity in college

[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:26.960]
is talking about that the other day.

[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:27.480]
Uh-huh.

[01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:29.580]
And one of the things you did was fundraising.

[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:34.280]
And what we did was we bought it when you're a racing fund based,

[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:39.020]
so you bought shoes of the crispy cream donuts,

[01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:42.180]
and then you go around the neighborhoods wherever you go and sell them.

[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:46.540]
And it said $0.55 on the package.

[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:49.700]
Where it doesn't glaze donuts.

[01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:50.220]
Uh-huh.

[01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:52.560]
I should have how much it goes to sell them for.

[01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:55.380]
Where we were, we told everybody that we paid $65,

[01:52:56.120 --> 01:52:57.260]
and we sold it for a dollar.

[01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:59.000]
The actual cost was $35.

[01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:05.380]
Well, being a pledge, you always have to volunteer your car

[01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:06.220]
and everything else.

[01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:08.800]
So I had probably, of course,

[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:12.300]
maybe $100,000 in the back seat of my car.

[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:15.320]
In the summer going from door to door,

[01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:20.980]
the end of the day my back seat was glazed.

[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.440]
And people still love them.

[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:28.960]
And you know, I had so much to be seen.

[01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:31.540]
I said, I had to order, look at it.

[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:32.820]
That's a point that was just number.

[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:35.200]
Yeah, that's what the guys always say when they borrow somebody's car.

[01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:37.180]
It was crispy cream donuts in the back, yeah.

[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.120]
Kind of, yeah.

[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:39.660]
And it had a hell of a night.

[01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:41.560]
And it was kind of gross and fun.

[01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:45.200]
They became the, they were giving me cow eyes,

[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:47.020]
but it was oysters, it came like that.

[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:48.520]
Those no, you'll be healed.

[01:53:49.060 --> 01:53:52.300]
And the other thing is I was very good friends with Jake and the Joe Lamata.

[01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:54.660]
And I spent time in their home.

[01:53:56.900 --> 01:54:00.800]
And as far as father and everything,

[01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:04.900]
Jake was pretty good.

[01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:07.880]
I'm seeing, you know, he was pretty good.

[01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:08.460]
Okay, thanks.

[01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:08.900]
Thanks, thank you.

[01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:09.320]
Okay, thanks.

[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:10.240]
Woo!

[01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:14.520]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:15.240]
Here's VOKA.

[01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:15.420]
Hello.

[01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:17.060]
Hi, Neil.

[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:17.500]
Yes, sir.

[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:22.200]
We were, you were talking, I want to follow suit like a learning with the crispy cream.

[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:24.360]
When you were over at WIOD,

[01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:29.080]
the first time we ever saw Phil Hendry was at a crispy cream in Fort Lauderdale

[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:30.480]
when they opened up on Federal Highway.

[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:34.940]
And he was sitting there in a big WIOD truck all by himself,

[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:37.280]
nobody in the stores, nobody at the crispy cream.

[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:39.600]
And we went up to him, we said, hello.

[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:42.480]
And he started one of his routines, and we said,

[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:43.920]
this guy's going to be great.

[01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:44.660]
Are you sure?

[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:45.980]
Are you sure?

[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:51.340]
So we just wanted to tell you that he was down there doing the promotion for them years and years ago.

[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:52.240]
How do you like that?

[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:54.580]
Now, what is he going to come back or how's he going to come back?

[01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:58.020]
I know he's going to come back somewhere in square-troll and somewhere on the radio,

[01:54:58.020 --> 01:55:00.000]
but he's not going to compete against you.

[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:00.460]
Yes.

[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:02.460]
Oh, god, this is definitely great.

[01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:03.220]
Now what are we going to do?

[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:04.200]
No, you tell me.

[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:04.720]
I don't know.

[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:05.640]
I'm not going to talk to him.

[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:06.460]
You tell him I have a left-wing.

[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:08.180]
I have a left-wing.

[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:08.480]
I have a left-wing.

[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:08.580]
I have a left-wing.

[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:08.600]
I have a left-wing.

[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:08.780]
I have a left-wing.

[01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:08.840]
I have a left-wing.

[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:08.840]

[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:08.840]

[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:08.840]

[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:09.580]
I'll be able to do those.

[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:12.040]
Do you know when he's coming back?

[01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:12.640]
Is this the end of the day?

[01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:15.100]
We come Monday, Monday, October 4th, 10 to 1 at night,

[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:17.000]
and the night and noon in the morning.

[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:17.460]
That's right.

[01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:18.380]
We'll never give you up.

[01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:19.200]
What is it?

[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:19.860]
We love you.

[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:20.640]
We'll never give you up.

[01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:21.940]
Thanks, guys.

[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:22.400]
Thanks, Jim.

[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:24.060]
Sure, that's what you say now.

[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:27.100]
Yeah, we hate you now.

[01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:27.860]
We hate you.

[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:28.940]
We want you to die.

[01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:30.080]
We can't stand you.

[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:31.180]
You perverted fangs.

[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:32.240]
You'll be despised.

[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:33.000]
You'll be despised.

[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:33.220]
We'll be despised.

[01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:37.220]
God, pardon me while I wipe them.

[01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:38.240]
You can solve my body.

[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:39.460]
Okay, from the last couple of hours.

[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:40.160]
But that's okay.

[01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:40.820]
I'm used to it.

[01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:43.940]
The city of love and brotherhood.

[01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:45.100]
Friendliness.

[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:47.160]
Yeah, reaching out and...

[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:47.560]
Humping it.

[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:52.180]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 50, 05, 60 on the AT&T line.

[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:52.380]
20, 05, 60 on the AT&T line.

[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:52.380]

[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:52.380]

[01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:58.820]
We're going to...

[01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:00.300]
We're going to...

[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:01.600]
We're going to...

[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:01.780]
We're going to...

[01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:02.280]
We're going to...

[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:02.880]
We're going to...

[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:03.160]
We're going to...

[01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:03.860]
We're going to...

[01:56:03.860 --> 01:56:04.060]
We're going to...

[01:56:04.060 --> 01:56:04.360]
We're going to...

[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:04.900]
We're going to...

[01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:05.500]
We're going to...

[01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:06.420]
We're going to...

[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:07.080]
We're going to...

[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:07.100]
We're going to...

[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:08.200]
We're going to...

[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:08.860]
We're going to...

[01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:09.500]
We're going to...

[01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:09.880]
We're going to...

[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:10.400]
We're going to...

[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:10.840]
We're going to...

[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:11.720]
We're going to...

[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:12.400]
We're going to...

[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:13.240]
We're going to...

[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:14.000]
We're going to...

[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:14.800]
We're going to...

[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:15.020]
We're going to...

[01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:17.720]
We're going to...

[01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:22.380]
We're going to...

[01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:22.840]
We're going to...

[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:22.840]

[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:24.560]
Let's start our play-down.

[01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:27.700]
And enshorts each own joy.

[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:28.960]
With joy thinking of it.

[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:29.680]
Before

[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:30.660]
200 November,

[01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:32.660]
Take a tan of the sun.

[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:34.400]
Oh, like that sun.

[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:36.320]
Oh, hi, that sun.

[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:37.300]
I love you.

[01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:40.600]
I see that sun.

[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:42.660]
I love you.

[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:46.880]
You are my light.

[01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:48.040]
I see that sun.

[01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:52.240]
I love you.

[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:55.540]
I see that sun.

[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:56.460]
I see that sun.

[01:56:56.780 --> 01:56:58.120]
I see that sun.

[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:00.640]
I see that sun.

[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:03.000]
I see that sun.

[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:03.040]
I see that sun.

[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:03.540]
I see that sun.

[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:03.720]
Yes, that sun.

[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:03.760]
No one knows.

[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:04.080]
It is a good place to be.

[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:07.140]
I'm not there in mid days with a dew loft shop.

[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:10.260]
I'm not there in mid days with a dew loft shop.

[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:14.980]
It is just amazing to me.

[01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:17.240]
First of all, if the two livestreams they use.

[01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:19.240]
If they were talking about a few things.

[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:21.360]
Where did they hear?

[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:25.300]
that. Or where did somebody you called them and picked them off? Where do they hear that?

[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:28.040]
There's only one place they could have heard it. That means they were listening over here.

[01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:31.960]
That's number one. Number two, I know if I'm on the year competing with somebody else,

[01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:37.720]
like they were allegedly competing with me, I'm going to brag about the fact that somebody else

[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:42.240]
is going to beat whoever I'm competing with. Not that I'm going to do it. Somebody else is going

[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:48.260]
to do it. Oh man, give me a break. I want a joke. What an unbelievable joke.

[01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:57.120]
5667-0560-050560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's Kendall. Hello. How you doing?

[01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:03.580]
You're pretty good, sir. First of all, I was going to say, did you read that article in sports weekend

[01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:09.000]
on the hill? How about Whitney? I mean, it didn't really say anything. Yeah, I read it. I took a look at it.

[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:13.120]
A little ask, just in saying. Right, didn't say anything. Like all our hockey articles, it said nothing.

[01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:18.860]
In second, do you have any information on Tom Green shows that is that off the air now?

[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:22.220]
I mean, I know they're showing a repeat, but are they? I started starting in October,

[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:29.780]
coming back with new shows. It's the funniest damn show. Third off, I didn't want to say something.

[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:35.980]
Charlie and Meredith are douche bags? Okay, have a great day, Phil. Okay.

[01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:43.840]
Wow. 5667-0560-050560 on the AT&T line. Here's Pemberg Pines. Hello.

[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:47.480]
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Yes, I'm calling you up. I want to

[01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:52.680]
you know that you're doing a great job. I enjoy your show. And I just like I said, I just got back

[01:58:52.680 --> 01:59:00.240]
from from Connecticut. I've been away for a few years. Okay. Whatever happened to the to Alan Burke,

[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:08.440]
Alan Burke show? Dead. Yeah. Cute. 5667-0560-050560 on the AT&T

[01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:14.000]
wireless line. Pony voice dead host. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:23.220]
Mobile in Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay. It's about a couple of years. I'm down

[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:27.920]
here at South Florida, originally from Montreal, Canada. Of course, getting excited for the upcoming

[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:35.460]
hockey season. And being up there hockey, I mean, almost impossible to get tickets at the forum and

[01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:40.400]
the molten center and all that. So looking down here, we should gain some tickets and to the

[01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:48.560]
the passer game. Yeah. Explain to me how they get away with charging $70 for those lower seats.

[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:54.240]
What do you mean explain to you? It's called whatever the market will bear if there are people

[01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:59.160]
dumb enough to pay it. They'll charge it. I mean, it works. That is in claim. I mean,

[02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:05.180]
concerts that will, you know, once in a lifetime up here, you go see what fine you'll want to be

[02:00:05.180 --> 02:00:08.840]
that. That's why they're having a bit of a time zone season tickets is here. That's why they got

[02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:12.960]
another not just the one they had back on Worshushana. That's why tomorrow they have another

[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:17.740]
pick your season seat day from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. I'm glad you mentioned that at the Macarena because

[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:22.240]
they're so desperate to try and sell some more season tickets. That is just crazy. You're right.

[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:28.320]
Oh my god. Not to mention the overpriced crappy food and the joint besides. Exactly.

[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:33.020]
Not to mention that there's no drainage in the parking lot. So the one night we had a flood

[02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:36.420]
at the game last year that people erupted their goddamn arm pits in water.

[02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:42.460]
No, yeah, yeah. Like I said, it's a whole different mentality. It just bring us your money. And if

[02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:47.100]
we put a crappy product out there, build complaint, just keep subsidizing us. You owe it to us and

[02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:51.260]
build us in New Orleans and build us a new stadium. And again, keep in mind, the Canadians, by the way,

[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:56.520]
pay the $11.8 million in taxes last year. More than anybody else in the league, the Panthers pay less

[02:00:56.520 --> 02:01:01.380]
than 100,000, which is why you got that big stink up there that they're trying to get the lottery

[02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:04.900]
money and all the kind of money to subsidize the Canadian team so they can stay in business.

[02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:10.840]
Yeah. Crazy. Yep. I don't want to know. Are you your lease fund?

[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:14.160]
Yes, sir. Are you a reclinator on Toronto? No, Rochester.

[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:18.960]
I come from the end of being lease. They're right across the lake. That's all we had right?

[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:22.100]
Right across the lake. So you're a bigger lease fund than Panthers, right?

[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:25.380]
By far, by a million miles, 41 years of excitement.

[02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:31.180]
All right. All right. You'll keep it a good job. This show you have is 10 times better than the crap

[02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:34.120]
you have up there than you tell you. Okay. All right. Thank you. I'll read the energy.

[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:40.360]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60. Go, leave school, baby. My job's not to break away. Nice going, my

[02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:45.220]
stuff. Some of the highlights from last night's 4, 3, exhibition win over a Vancouver.

[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.780]
Leaves are looking pretty good again. Is here anybody here care about that? No.

[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:52.780]
This guy is right. It's just amazing. It's astonishing.

[02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:58.180]
You see, the people down here that you like try to remake the real world. That's the thing

[02:01:58.180 --> 02:02:02.140]
that I love about so many of these people here. Like any place else you go in there,

[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:06.640]
people who are interested in, you know, ABC and the variety of things, all of these things.

[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:11.280]
And here it's like, oh no, you're talking to four language to us. We don't have another call

[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:15.460]
from Boston on here. Do we? Hello? Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, how are you doing?

[02:02:15.540 --> 02:02:19.920]
They're pretty good. I'm from down here on vacation. Well, you're from Boston. Yeah, I've

[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:23.800]
always listened to on the internet. And I'm starving for lunch. And you're talking about,

[02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:27.460]
you're eating some from Macaroni Grillius today? Yeah. What was that?

[02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:33.320]
How you ate there about when the first open, I tell you, it sucked. I'll take care of it.

[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:38.680]
It was great. Scalapini de Polo with this year with Angel Hare pasta, which I passed on the

[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:42.120]
pasta, but it was great. Oh, yeah, I got to give that a try. I got one down the street from here.

[02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:46.180]
Okay. So, um, hey, you have a great show, man. Thanks a lot. Thanks. I love your

[02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:52.060]
mantra. 5, 6, 7, 05, 60. Pine, believe me, if I didn't like it, I would tell you because it's

[02:02:52.060 --> 02:02:54.920]
curious, sir, and it's a count. Okay. So if I thought that it sucked, or that was less

[02:02:54.920 --> 02:03:00.560]
in sensation, light would be the first one to tell you, but it was great. Now, they just keep

[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:04.200]
that sparks are off the table there next time I go for dinner. I'll be real happy. Or anybody else.

[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:07.440]
Just get out of here, whether he's dark, whether he's light, just keep the goddamn heart

[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:10.900]
and help off the table. We don't need no singing. Please, please.

[02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:15.460]
Wasn't that him? That was him.

[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:30.340]
Oh my god. I feel like I've just had a goddamn cannonball stuck in my rectum. Wow.

[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:38.900]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60. We hate Andy from a Hollywood. We hate him. We despise him. We wish he would die soon.

[02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:44.660]
Die, Diana. That's our wish for you on Sookas. Hasn't sucked this.

[02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:54.580]
God. Here's a mobile in Lake Worth. Hello. Hey, knew how you doing today, sir. Okay.

[02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:59.740]
You figure that guy is still listening, huh? Andy guy still is. He's still listening. That was him.

[02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:04.820]
New, I don't know if anyone has mentioned this to you today. I was watching

[02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:09.440]
NBC last night. My wife watching friends and stuff like that. Yeah.

[02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:12.940]
And they played the abacovian fidget commercial.

[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:17.840]
I have to make it guys wrestling. No, the wrestling spot. That's my favorite spot.

[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:22.820]
Oh, you've seen it already. Oh, yeah. Oh, I thought I saw a man. I held on to him.

[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:26.260]
I told him I'm not. There's a spot for him to see on TV. Yeah.

[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:28.700]
Yeah. I also want to do. Yes, sir.

[02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:33.800]
Rian, Eddie, major flaming dish bag. Okay. Thank you. We get you. Okay. You too.

[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:38.380]
Yeah. That wrestling business. That's a great club. You more on. No question about it.

[02:04:38.380 --> 02:04:42.240]
You can deny it all you want. You can get pissed off. All you want. Okay. We won't out you.

[02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:47.040]
But we know what that's all about. Okay. A little grab ass. A lot of grab ass. And grab whatever

[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:53.360]
else you get a fistful of dollars. Five, six, seven, oh five, 60 pound five, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:57.040]
The evercrombie and fish wrestling spot number one, baby.

[02:04:58.980 --> 02:05:02.520]
I'm not as good as the kid had a little offender, bender on Oakland Park. Did I mention that by the way,

[02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:08.400]
20 or 30 times? I felt like just parking my car right there and standing on the side of the road.

[02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:10.600]
Just steering. Yeah. What's wrong with that?

[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:16.700]
Yeah. In fact, I left a cop with him. I wanted to go over and say, hey, listen,

[02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:20.180]
whatever, just offender, bender, whatever, the damage to your car. I'll take care of it. We can

[02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:27.640]
work something out. No problem at all. Here's four Myers. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir.

[02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:32.980]
You know that guy that called about the fraternity? Did he say something about they glazed his back seat?

[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:36.280]
Yeah. They said they glazed it back to his back side.

[02:05:36.300 --> 02:05:43.320]
Backed him. Uh-huh. And good show. Closing. Can I hear the Brittany bit? Same with your quest.

[02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:47.580]
Okay. All right. You got it. All right. And happy circus in four Myers too, by the way.

[02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:50.960]
Ha, ha. You hear that? He said, all right. Very well. Too, by the way. It's good job.

[02:05:51.860 --> 02:05:55.240]
Too bad we can't talk to our good friends over there in four Myers because we got a bunch of

[02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:58.500]
cheap bricks running this off. But I'm going to tell you we got some real changes coming and

[02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:04.920]
we'll just be underwear around this joint. These people are gotten the free pass for two freaking

[02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:08.700]
long. These people around here. That's going to change very, very, very fast.

[02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:17.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[02:06:17.980 --> 02:06:21.640]
Neil, long time listen. How you doing? All right, sir. Listen, I'm going to do a little

[02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:26.100]
suck job here. Neil, I think you're great, man. When you leave this town, we don't know what we're

[02:06:26.100 --> 02:06:30.060]
going to do without you. I don't know what I'm going to do without you. Listen, let me ask your

[02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:34.240]
question. If there were to extend your contract, would you stay a little longer, Neil? No.

[02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:44.540]
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. What's the question?

[02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:48.380]
Neil, I think that George does a great job, but nevertheless you are the best, you know,

[02:06:48.460 --> 02:06:51.880]
on what you do. But I think when you leave, when these people want George back, I want to talk

[02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:55.500]
about the swing club. So you can hand him right to the edge of a rare major sexual experience.

[02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:59.740]
No. I think I'm going to tell you more to get right to that moment of excitement and then

[02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:03.440]
you know, just go limp. I think he is interesting. I mean, he talked about a lot of stuff.

[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:05.640]
I didn't say it was interesting. I just said that he had them all excited.

[02:07:07.020 --> 02:07:10.320]
Well, Neil, I don't have that much material. It's raining here in Miami like crack. Yeah,

[02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:13.380]
I heard it's raining like crazy. You know, Sam is over there. That celebrity golfer.

[02:07:13.500 --> 02:07:16.960]
I mean, we got we asked, you know, pretend you do some work and we just asked Clarence,

[02:07:16.980 --> 02:07:20.240]
how's it going over there? And he said it's raining cats and dogs. Yeah, it's raining for

[02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:23.900]
better. This whole weekend is going to rain out here. Listen, I got a car for you. You ready?

[02:07:24.100 --> 02:07:31.460]
Yes, sir. Okay. Well, what happened to that avocado? I got to play that today. I love that.

[02:07:32.180 --> 02:07:38.020]
You know, five six seven oh five sixty pounds. It's raining cats and dogs. That kind of explains

[02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:42.580]
and that's another one of those goddamn days. Jesus Christ, are we getting tired of this or what?

[02:07:42.620 --> 02:07:50.560]
Oh, man. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. You picked that wind bag at a

[02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:52.900]
major afloat for nothing.

[02:07:57.460 --> 02:08:00.340]
Another one. The guy with the eyes.

[02:08:03.140 --> 02:08:07.820]
For not being intolerant. Are you wrong? I am intolerant of guys like Asgel. Like you.

[02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:10.620]
Him and Barry, his boyfriend.

[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:17.780]
But you know something. It's a bit because no, any day, any day of my life that I decide to come

[02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:21.060]
in here, even after I'm working, if I come back for a visit, sit down. They'll be there.

[02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:26.300]
Oh, Neil's coming over here. We're listening. So you can give me a song of dance like I said before.

[02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:33.740]
They could put Jesus Moses, the Dalai Lama and Phil Henry and Howard and any other 20 people they

[02:08:33.740 --> 02:08:40.880]
want and they could bring back Greg and the Pete Bolger to invoices and these people will all still

[02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:46.180]
be listening, especially them, the no lives.

[02:08:48.540 --> 02:08:55.700]
Thank God for you. You ought to be kissing my feet. Okay. I'm the only thing that gives some of

[02:08:55.700 --> 02:09:01.000]
you any meaning in your life, especially in this God-den-bashed of death and his wilderness.

[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:04.800]
Thank God for...

[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:09.360]
Oh, God! This is 560, QAM.

[02:09:12.060 --> 02:09:16.840]
Oh, boy. It's the one to two hours.

[02:09:31.800 --> 02:09:32.160]
Oh, been.

[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:36.600]
I liked it.

[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.640]
Things about me, I don't think you know

[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:06.440]
I'm on my way

[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:11.200]
And I'm here, you should be here

[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:17.000]
And me, cause you could go to jail and have to see with me

[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:22.240]
If I'm free, you and your friends are me

[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:27.000]
She was 25 but she's just a team

[02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:31.420]
Perfectly, I've been my last

[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.820]
I've waited for you, daddy called me cos I'm not

[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:36.200]
All right

[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:41.160]
My best off perfectly, because I've had such a big

[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:45.260]
No, I'm not gonna switch by me

[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:49.420]
My best offing right now

[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.160]
Oh, my show

[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:52.140]
What, what, what, what, don't

[02:10:52.140 --> 02:10:54.700]
She's a rich, she'll pay

[02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:59.800]
25, she should be scared of death

[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:00.960]
Yeah, the mental

[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:04.700]
Those band leaders are kind of fine

[02:11:04.700 --> 02:11:08.460]
What, what, what, what, she's not in my

[02:11:09.860 --> 02:11:13.440]
25, I'm actually a 25 but she's just

[02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:14.560]
How young is she?

[02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:14.860]
How young?

[02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:20.420]
It's 103 at 560, WQA and 560, 7.0, 560, 0.560

[02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:24.680]
On the 18T wireless line, Brittany was on

[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:25.380]
Did anybody see that?

[02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:26.480]
No, I've seen it

[02:11:26.860 --> 02:11:28.900]
Looking pretty good, Brittany, whether they're real or not

[02:11:28.900 --> 02:11:29.860]
Looking pretty good

[02:11:29.860 --> 02:11:32.280]
Not as lovely as Jeff from 98 degrees

[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:33.880]
And of course Nick, who can really sing

[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:34.680]
Even though he is ugly

[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:37.020]
A boy he can sing, he can bring it

[02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:39.820]
Let's do a Miami, hello

[02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:41.460]
Hey Neil

[02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:41.920]
Yes sir

[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:45.040]
Do you think you'll ever be as red hot as how it's done?

[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:46.660]
Is red hot?

[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:48.360]
Yeah, what do you call it?

[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:50.300]
How do you like that?

[02:11:50.420 --> 02:11:52.240]
He couldn't even like get the words in the right order

[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:00.140]
560, 560, 0.560, on the 18T wireless line

[02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:02.160]
No, I'll never have Howard's hair, that's for God damn sure

[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:03.780]
I'll never have his money or his hair

[02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:06.660]
Here's Fort Lauderdale, hello

[02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:07.520]
Hi Dale

[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:08.240]
Yes sir

[02:12:09.220 --> 02:12:09.980]
Can't hear you

[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:10.980]
Can't hear me?

[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:11.700]
No I can hear you

[02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:12.520]
Okay, sorry about that

[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:12.920]
A little bit

[02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:16.080]
Listen, didn't you have trouble with your little dogs

[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:17.820]
That anal sphincter thing?

[02:12:18.260 --> 02:12:18.420]
No

[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:20.320]
Anal express?

[02:12:20.820 --> 02:12:20.960]
What?

[02:12:21.260 --> 02:12:22.220]
That was just a guy

[02:12:22.220 --> 02:12:24.820]
Crazy lady, that was the scooting lady

[02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:28.220]
Oh, I thought you had a problem with a little doxin

[02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:29.020]
Yeah

[02:12:29.020 --> 02:12:30.160]
It just caused me to be good

[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:31.720]
Oh yeah, well it's lunch time, we're eating lunch

[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:32.720]
We don't want to hear about your dog

[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:33.140]
Correcto

[02:12:33.140 --> 02:12:33.960]
I mean the middle of lunch

[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:35.640]
It just caused me 400 blocks down

[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:37.240]
Have his anal sphincter express?

[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:37.240]

[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:38.400]
How do you pay for it with Visa?

[02:12:38.620 --> 02:12:40.600]
Yeah, I charge today

[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:42.740]
Okay, well good luck pal, don't do it again

[02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:45.600]
Right, in the middle of my lunch, and this guy wants to talk about his dog's ass

[02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:47.340]
Oh God

[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:51.560]
Well I tell you one thing, we got the best conversationalist in this town

[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:56.080]
The guy with the eyes, by the way, is the guy that I dumped before the last break

[02:12:56.080 --> 02:12:58.900]
Which I really shouldn't have dumped it, I should let it go on a year

[02:12:58.900 --> 02:13:03.460]
But just hearing that voice, just knowing who it was immediately makes me die for that yellow button

[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:05.360]
Yeah, you should be

[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:08.060]
Oh, you're an asshole for being a...

[02:13:08.060 --> 02:13:09.800]
Well, for not being intolerant

[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:14.560]
The guy, he not only are you pathetic and you look like crap, but you're illiterate to top it all off

[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:16.620]
He wants to thank me for not being intolerant

[02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:19.340]
For my loyal listeners like him and Barry

[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:23.060]
His boyfriend, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

[02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:27.420]
Barry, I'm gonna tell you one thing right now, you know when the beginning of the end for talk radio wasn't this town?

[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:32.020]
And I was just telling George Dune, and I'm not exaggerating, I'm telling you right now

[02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:34.700]
I'll give you a little clue who the beginning of the end was for talk radio

[02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:35.640]
I am that him, right?

[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:36.080]
That's right

[02:13:36.740 --> 02:13:40.720]
When Gary Bruce puts your rentals on here, not once but twice on Iowa Day on a weekend

[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:43.400]
That was the kiss of death, that's when the phones started going dead

[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:47.400]
That's when he started bringing all these misfits in and putting them on the air and catering and suck it up to them

[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:50.960]
It reminds me way, way, way back in the days when I was doing nights at INZ

[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:55.820]
And they brought a guy named John McHugh and put him on a weekend, who's now dead by the way

[02:13:55.820 --> 02:13:59.180]
They brought him over from Fort Myers, anybody over there remember John McHugh?

[02:13:59.300 --> 02:13:59.440]
No

[02:13:59.440 --> 02:13:59.920]
He's dead

[02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:03.100]
He used to sleep in the trunk of his car

[02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:07.020]
Now he used to sleep in the back of the car, I think he had his wife in the trunk, is the way it worked out

[02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:08.900]
And the trunk was shut tight

[02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:12.260]
And this guy, with the same thing

[02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:15.160]
Oh, it's the computer, hacker is in the computer, chronic

[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:19.040]
And he made the whole show catered to all the people that we were trying to get rid of

[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:22.580]
The rest of the week, we were trying to get rid of these people and this guy would cater to them

[02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:25.780]
And do a whole show to them

[02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:27.860]
But you know the good part?

[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:29.840]
He's dead

[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:33.080]
He's dead, John McHugh is dead

[02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:34.220]
Let's hear it

[02:14:34.220 --> 02:14:36.260]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[02:14:38.180 --> 02:14:39.940]
God, talk about a pain in the ass

[02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:46.320]
I am that him right, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, I tell you one thing, though I do want to apologize to my good friend Andy from Hollywood, he's my favorite

[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:47.380]
He's a sweetheart

[02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:55.060]
He could be, seriously, he makes the guy with the eyes seem adorable

[02:14:56.300 --> 02:14:58.540]
That's how revolting Andy from Hollywood is

[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:01.620]
He makes the guy with the eyes seem like Brad Pitt

[02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:03.900]
Like Ray Whitney

[02:15:07.060 --> 02:15:08.640]
Here's a lady in Coral Springs, hello

[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:10.260]
Hello, Neil

[02:15:10.260 --> 02:15:10.880]
Yes, man

[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:19.380]
The other day you were broadcasting, sounded like from Canada, you know, a story about the Canadian and the hockey players

[02:15:19.380 --> 02:15:23.260]
And thinking we're talking about the abuse, well, in today's new time

[02:15:23.260 --> 02:15:26.500]
Oh, and by the way, Goddamn it, Oprah Winfrey today, which I hate that bitch

[02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:33.520]
But a 4 o'clock on channel 4, that's her show is about the athletes, young athletes being sexually abused and et cetera, and by their, et cetera

[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:36.600]
Well, you'll like this, listen to this little piece of an article

[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:43.480]
After the Canadian snowbirds flew north for the summer, the daily scaled back their Canadian coverage, Canada coverage

[02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:51.940]
And even when they were publishing dispatches on Canadian hockey and politics, the papers failed to pick up on an intriguing story with an actual connection to South Florida

[02:15:51.940 --> 02:16:04.920]
It seems that over the past 30 years, at least it doesn't meant from the Ontario border town of Cornwall, we're bringing young boys down to 4 Lutterdale for all expenses paid weekends of sea and sun and pedophilia

[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:06.480]
See this here? Oh, right!

[02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:14.300]
The enormity of the scandal first became apparent three years ago when a man and a group who had first been a victim and then a victimizer came forward

[02:16:14.300 --> 02:16:22.920]
The man who had since gone into hiding told police about the activities as many of the most prominent men in Cornwall among them priests, lawyers and police officers

[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:24.680]
What's the name of that town, Cornwall?

[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:30.200]
Corn, a special investigation depth project truth was launched

[02:16:30.200 --> 02:16:37.640]
The sexual abuse that began in Cornwall is alleged to have continued in rooms rented in downtown hotels near the beach and Fort Lutterdale

[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:38.240]
Oh my God!

[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:42.920]
And many of the names of the men charged allegedly appear on old motel registers

[02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:46.480]
Oh my God! Oh my God! Isn't that something that's in the shirt?

[02:16:46.740 --> 02:16:47.260]
How do you like that?

[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:49.100]
Just thought you might be interested

[02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:49.980]
Thanks for the good news!

[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:50.420]
Bye-bye!

[02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:52.820]
How the right-to-late is incident, thank you! How do you like that?

[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:55.240]
More priests fondling young boys

[02:16:55.240 --> 02:17:01.140]
That's it! Just keep shopping your kids back to church and keep putting the money into place and subsidizing this corrupt goddamn thing

[02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:03.140]
Just keep doing it!

[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:03.900]
And you will

[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:11.180]
Even though you know what it is but because you've been so brainwashed and you can't open up your eyes and see like it snipped the fresh air

[02:17:11.180 --> 02:17:14.320]
And go out there and stand in the rain and like bathe your cleanse yourselves

[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:16.000]
God!

[02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:22.360]
Just goes on and on and on! Oh what's up? I'm so glad you called! I almost forgot about my thing with a Pope here

[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:26.180]
Here it is, on page 2 A, speaking of Canadian

[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:29.700]
Pope gets his own rose-colored glasses

[02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:33.880]
And here's a picture of the Pope who doesn't look a day over 400 by the way

[02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:37.000]
And there is Bono from you two

[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.460]
Oh, whoa! God! It despise you two

[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:46.560]
You two singer Bono, Quincy Jones and Bob Gelboff joined Pope John Paul II and on Thursday

[02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:52.960]
in Castellgondolpo, Italy to support his call for canceling the debts of the world's poorest countries for the new millennium

[02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:56.680]
The three met with the Pope for 20 minutes at his residence outside Rome

[02:17:56.680 --> 02:18:03.900]
He welcomed them as delegates of the group known as Jubilee 2000 which is seeking the cancellation of the debts as a fitting gesture to mark the millennium

[02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:12.580]
You're a great showman as well as a great holy man, a tyla's Bono told the Pope before slipping off his pink-tinted glasses and handing them to the pot of as a souvenir

[02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:15.660]
I think the Pope liked the pink by the way

[02:18:16.420 --> 02:18:17.220]
He said lovely

[02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:21.720]
How do you like that? They're trying to cancel the debts of the world's poorest countries

[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:24.580]
Of course they are because they're responsible for it with all the overpopulation

[02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:27.660]
With making all these goddamn babies that they can't feed

[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:32.360]
So if you cancel the debts now, oh yeah, now start making a whole bunch of babies again

[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:34.820]
Because now we're not in debt so we can start from scratch again

[02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:38.480]
It's like if somebody races the debt and all your credit cards

[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:41.460]
And now you go to town and you'll be out shopping all weekend

[02:18:41.460 --> 02:18:43.180]
Start from scratch and build it up again

[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:47.100]
Crazy people, that's what it is

[02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:49.480]
See in the world through goddamn puse-colored glasses

[02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:51.660]
The Pope's Pope's Pope's Pope!

[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:52.180]
Amen

[02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:56.640]
He's puffing on something, I'll guarantee you that probably as we speak

[02:18:57.840 --> 02:19:00.500]
Ten minutes after one at 560 WQAM

[02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:02.440]
Can beat that gator meat

[02:19:12.540 --> 02:19:16.380]
Listen to this sound of John John falling in flames

[02:19:16.380 --> 02:19:19.480]
All arguing into the peace

[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:24.580]
You think of us humiliating there like JFK

[02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:27.420]
Good, a sport of better flame

[02:19:27.420 --> 02:19:28.060]
Yes

[02:19:28.060 --> 02:19:31.340]
It's JFK at 4th time flying

[02:19:31.340 --> 02:19:36.780]
We will upload a hyper-fussed cheap and crappy plate that's closed

[02:19:36.780 --> 02:19:41.700]
A gun they definitely has about the only way to get through

[02:19:44.780 --> 02:19:49.140]
Now, head to the clothing one that lives the lives of the day

[02:19:49.140 --> 02:19:51.980]
From what they call the Kennedy curse

[02:19:53.060 --> 02:19:57.000]
If Dorothy killed Galleon from the lives she'd say

[02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:00.240]
Here up its only gonna get worse

[02:20:00.780 --> 02:20:05.240]
And this is the sound of John John falling in flames

[02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:08.260]
But it's flat and flat and flat

[02:20:08.260 --> 02:20:12.540]
We're gonna take away this sound of John John John

[02:20:12.540 --> 02:20:15.220]
It's gonna take away this person who doesn't want to be 15

[02:20:15.220 --> 02:20:17.240]
I've already won 155 WQAM

[02:20:18.420 --> 02:20:20.680]
So we get another fact from Gesu by the way

[02:20:21.480 --> 02:20:23.820]
See as long as I keep mentioning him he'll never go away

[02:20:23.820 --> 02:20:25.220]
So it's kind of like a catch-22

[02:20:26.460 --> 02:20:28.620]
Here's my good close best personal friend JP

[02:20:30.600 --> 02:20:31.040]
Hello

[02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:31.600]
Yeah

[02:20:31.600 --> 02:20:32.220]
How you doing?

[02:20:32.420 --> 02:20:33.000]
How you doing, yeah?

[02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:33.340]
Great

[02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:35.020]
I just wanted to call him

[02:20:35.020 --> 02:20:35.780]
Same without you though

[02:20:35.780 --> 02:20:36.900]
Yeah, I bet

[02:20:36.900 --> 02:20:39.840]
I just wanted to see how everybody was doing just calling him in

[02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:41.760]
Not the same without you sweetheart

[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:42.820]
How was your vacation?

[02:20:43.140 --> 02:20:43.460]
Great

[02:20:44.160 --> 02:20:44.740]
Where'd you go?

[02:20:44.920 --> 02:20:45.320]
Went to Amsterdam

[02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:46.160]
Yeah

[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:48.500]
I had a good fun out there

[02:20:48.500 --> 02:20:49.980]
So how's Gainesville, huh?

[02:20:50.500 --> 02:20:53.560]
Gainesville is a Gainesville, there's not many ways to explain it

[02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:56.300]
Lots of in-breds, lots of crazy-gate fans

[02:20:56.300 --> 02:20:58.100]
So you're getting a lot of action up there or what?

[02:20:59.160 --> 02:20:59.920]
No comment

[02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:02.840]
People could be listening, they'd know me

[02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:03.760]
Come on

[02:21:03.760 --> 02:21:04.920]
They want to know

[02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:05.820]
I'm a good boy

[02:21:05.820 --> 02:21:07.300]
Okay, you're getting a lot of action good

[02:21:07.300 --> 02:21:10.620]
Now whatever happened to you and your young lady friend, did you?

[02:21:10.940 --> 02:21:11.560]
I was still a makeup

[02:21:11.560 --> 02:21:12.920]
We're still really good friends

[02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:13.780]
Good friends

[02:21:13.780 --> 02:21:15.280]
Yeah, but no longer an item

[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:16.580]
Not really

[02:21:16.580 --> 02:21:16.780]
Well

[02:21:17.920 --> 02:21:20.180]
Well there's a lot of fish in the C.J.P. I'll tell you that

[02:21:20.180 --> 02:21:20.920]
Yeah, yeah

[02:21:21.980 --> 02:21:22.860]
Let's go up here

[02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:26.100]
But yeah, we still talk

[02:21:26.100 --> 02:21:28.980]
I'm coming in town this weekend to do my cousin's wedding

[02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:30.020]
And she's coming with me

[02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:32.180]
Well, I wouldn't be a first, I guess, huh?

[02:21:34.380 --> 02:21:35.100]
But anyway

[02:21:35.100 --> 02:21:35.560]
Yeah

[02:21:35.560 --> 02:21:37.780]
So how's that going on, I'm doing

[02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:39.120]
Everybody's doing great, man

[02:21:39.120 --> 02:21:40.980]
It's the same place, but like I said, not quite

[02:21:40.980 --> 02:21:42.800]
There's just an element lacking here, you know

[02:21:42.800 --> 02:21:44.420]
We've got a lot of ugly people working around here

[02:21:44.420 --> 02:21:46.560]
How's Jeff Cohen the most non-proverted person?

[02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:47.940]
Jeff Cohen is still ugly as ever, yeah

[02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:49.800]
Well, listen, it's great here

[02:21:49.800 --> 02:21:50.880]
From your company at home sometime

[02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:51.620]
When you get real bored

[02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:52.340]
I shall

[02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:53.600]
Okay, take care

[02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:54.020]
See you

[02:21:54.020 --> 02:21:57.000]
There's the lovely J.P. who is incredibly boring on the phone

[02:21:57.380 --> 02:21:58.180]
Five-six, what?

[02:21:58.460 --> 02:21:59.980]
Oh, he's a great guy and he looks great

[02:21:59.980 --> 02:22:01.980]
But he's though, and what have I always told you about that?

[02:22:02.060 --> 02:22:03.840]
Okay, people that sound really good on the phone

[02:22:03.840 --> 02:22:06.560]
They look like a crap

[02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:08.620]
And people that sound really dull on the phone

[02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:11.020]
They're the ones that look really, really

[02:22:11.020 --> 02:22:12.500]
I mean, really good

[02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:18.240]
Five-six-seven-oh-five-six-tea-pound-five-six-tea-on-a-at-n-t-watt-as-line-and-e from Hollywood

[02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:19.880]
Says, you are the guy who called an apology

[02:22:19.880 --> 02:22:22.000]
I didn't call, I promised it wasn't me

[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.360]
Thanks for thinking about me

[02:22:23.860 --> 02:22:24.980]
Andy, he says

[02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:27.260]
Isn't it great to have him back?

[02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:31.140]
I won't have to be great when Phil starts on Monday October 4th

[02:22:31.140 --> 02:22:34.040]
So he'll be over there at 940 on the AM Dial Listening to the Phil Henry Show

[02:22:34.040 --> 02:22:38.000]
And talk it in Margaret and all those wonderful people, characters, Bob Green

[02:22:39.180 --> 02:22:42.760]
Five-six-seven-oh-five-six-tea-pound-five-six-tea-on-a-at-n-t-watt-as-line

[02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:43.980]
Here's the deer field, hello

[02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:46.280]
Yeah, I just didn't need it, how you doing?

[02:22:46.380 --> 02:22:46.860]
Okay, sir

[02:22:46.860 --> 02:22:48.200]
Nice to caught me off guard there

[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:48.640]
I know

[02:22:48.640 --> 02:22:51.320]
You were talking about the year of the Pope, maybe pussing on something

[02:22:51.320 --> 02:22:51.700]
Yeah

[02:22:51.700 --> 02:22:53.700]
I think he's probably pussing on an altar boy

[02:22:53.700 --> 02:22:54.780]
That's what I meant

[02:22:54.780 --> 02:22:55.480]
Yeah, I know

[02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:56.040]
That was the idea

[02:22:56.040 --> 02:22:57.880]
I know, hey there was a collar last week

[02:22:57.880 --> 02:22:59.100]
Or maybe one of the Swiss guard, yes?

[02:22:59.340 --> 02:23:02.260]
There was a collar last week that called in and he said that he could just got a ticket

[02:23:02.260 --> 02:23:03.640]
And there was too many polices

[02:23:04.300 --> 02:23:04.820]
Mm-hmm

[02:23:04.820 --> 02:23:05.400]
You remember that?

[02:23:05.620 --> 02:23:05.820]
Yeah

[02:23:05.820 --> 02:23:07.860]
Well, it just reminded me of my favorite song

[02:23:08.540 --> 02:23:10.340]
Every breath you take by the polices

[02:23:10.340 --> 02:23:10.860]
Yeah

[02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:12.400]
That's one of my favorites

[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:16.120]
Okay, listen, there's this great new station on the dial 17-hundreds

[02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:19.920]
I think you're just exactly what they're looking from between 8 and 10 PM

[02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:21.040]
Or 6 or was it 6 and 8?

[02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:21.900]
4 and 6?

[02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:24.380]
Whatever, sometime in the afternoon, they're the buries very upset with their lineup

[02:23:24.380 --> 02:23:26.700]
He's very frustrated because they got a bunch of crap on there

[02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:29.980]
And very basically, it's saying, can't you guys do better than this crap?

[02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:31.340]
You're making me look bad

[02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:33.400]
They're laughing at laughing

[02:23:33.900 --> 02:23:34.920]
That's a buries saying

[02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:37.680]
So I would definitely get this guy over there, you know

[02:23:38.940 --> 02:23:43.420]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[02:23:43.420 --> 02:23:46.780]
There's nothing, nothing worse than people try to be funny

[02:23:46.780 --> 02:23:48.680]
Who are like this last guy

[02:23:49.880 --> 02:23:50.880]
Here's Hollywood, hello

[02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:52.300]
Hey, Nail

[02:23:52.300 --> 02:23:52.780]
Yes, sir

[02:23:53.300 --> 02:23:58.120]
Do you see that story about the, I think it was 7 or 8 years old

[02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:01.020]
The kid that got hit by the county bus last night or yesterday morning?

[02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:02.920]
That hit by the bus, yeah

[02:24:02.920 --> 02:24:06.240]
By the bus driver, by the bus driver, there keeps running into things, yeah

[02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:11.100]
Right, right, right, you see that, I mean, the kid, I mean, they broke the story

[02:24:11.100 --> 02:24:14.200]
Whatever time it was, noon or well, actually in the morning

[02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:17.780]
By noon yesterday, the family already said we've got an attorney

[02:24:17.780 --> 02:24:18.940]
We've hired an attorney

[02:24:18.940 --> 02:24:26.040]
I mean, didn't even think about, you know, let's, you know, have a funeral, let's do a thing

[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:28.120]
I don't know how they didn't think about it, what happened?

[02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:37.040]
I mean, they made the statement that, you know, the, the, one of the family members said, you know, when they interviewed her, well, we've already retained a lawyer

[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:46.440]
You know, the father didn't come and say, well, you know, maybe I'm partially a fault because I left my young child in the dark waiting for a county bus to go to school

[02:24:46.440 --> 02:24:49.240]
Which normally I never do, but I forgot something today

[02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:51.960]
You know, it's just the whole world, no one's accountable for themselves

[02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:57.600]
They're always looking to, you know, I mean, granite the lady has run into two other, you know, two poles or whatever

[02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:00.260]
They're running into stuff, you have a couple of holes and now a black hole

[02:25:00.260 --> 02:25:05.440]
No, she does, you know, and she, and maybe she's, you know, partially a fault

[02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:07.680]
I heard she run to her frogs in her spare time as well, I hear

[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:10.380]
But you know, she's probably far too far too

[02:25:10.380 --> 02:25:13.420]
But you know, what about the parents? Everybody wants to sue everybody

[02:25:13.420 --> 02:25:15.760]
I mean, this is nothing we don't already know

[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:16.780]
You're known to understand

[02:25:16.780 --> 02:25:18.440]
That's the American f***ing way

[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:18.900]
You should get it

[02:25:18.900 --> 02:25:20.360]
I know, I know

[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:22.440]
A lot of lawyers out there got to make a lot of cash, man

[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:29.340]
It's just that, it's just sad that, you know, within a couple of hours after it happened, they've already, you know, made that statement as a family

[02:25:29.340 --> 02:25:33.320]
You know, I mean, they, you know, I don't know, it's just sad that you're trading

[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:37.360]
You're taking a sound bite from television and now you're, you know, you're characterizing a whole family

[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:39.500]
based on what you see taken out of context

[02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:41.520]
You don't know what the hell the story is

[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:42.040]
Right

[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:43.680]
Okay, okay

[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:44.140]
How do you get that?

[02:25:44.260 --> 02:25:44.820]
And back to you

[02:25:45.300 --> 02:25:49.300]
In addition to which, I've ever seen some of these people that drive the school buses, I'm going to tell you something

[02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:52.700]
I mean, I thought that antiminal was dead and buried, you know

[02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:55.820]
I see some of these people driving school buses

[02:25:55.820 --> 02:25:57.660]
It's a miracle they can get in the seat behind the wheel

[02:25:57.660 --> 02:26:01.140]
They make out goals, they look like Rumpel Stiltskin

[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:07.720]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:10.660]
I got to was depressing here and from, not depressing here and from JP

[02:26:10.660 --> 02:26:12.680]
Because we all love him, of course, I sure do

[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:15.360]
But just on the phone, he just don't cut it, you know

[02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:17.180]
We cut the phone

[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:21.360]
You follow what I'm saying?

[02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:23.880]
And not seriously, it's just he's not a phone guy

[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:26.040]
He's not a verbal guy

[02:26:26.580 --> 02:26:26.900]
Right

[02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:29.780]
Of course, you're not supposed to prop the word

[02:26:30.620 --> 02:26:34.040]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T line

[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:35.500]
Here's a mobile and four-letter deal, hello

[02:26:36.140 --> 02:26:36.760]
Hello, Neil

[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:37.300]
Yes sir

[02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:38.420]
Hey, how you doing?

[02:26:38.620 --> 02:26:38.800]
Great

[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:42.820]
Like your preference to conversation by saying first of all that the fan blows

[02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:47.760]
And I'd like to add in a little addition to your list of high possibility homosexuals

[02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:50.020]
All directors

[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:56.000]
Okay, great, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:56.880]
What do people do that?

[02:26:56.960 --> 02:26:59.560]
What do they think they're going to let them out people by name on the year?

[02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:00.500]
And I'm going to let it go

[02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:02.380]
I mean, are you some kind of a moron, sir?

[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:03.600]
Some kind of a jet cast?

[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:04.920]
I'm here, some kind of an imbecile?

[02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:07.560]
See there, I go again, just like Barry Jacket said

[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:11.180]
See, we're supposed to be nice to all the coars

[02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:13.160]
We're just supposed to let them say whatever they want

[02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:15.920]
Oh yes, thank you, yes sir, yes sir, yes ma'am

[02:27:17.860 --> 02:27:19.900]
That would be real exciting radio, Barry

[02:27:19.900 --> 02:27:23.000]
That's your idea, and of course you wouldn't know what God damn radio, Barry

[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:24.700]
If they stuck it in your echo, okay?

[02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:31.320]
Just like Tom Jickel, we don't have any, but I wonder how long it'll be before Tom Jickel gets to fill Henry's story

[02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:34.100]
Now that Tom is out of writing about the radio, he's out of that business

[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:43.140]
56670560, count 560 on the AT&T wireless live

[02:27:44.040 --> 02:27:45.060]
Here's Hollywood, hello

[02:27:45.700 --> 02:27:47.300]
Hey, knew how you doing, okay sir?

[02:27:47.540 --> 02:27:49.940]
I got a full plate, so I'll make up for these other callers

[02:27:49.940 --> 02:27:50.360]
Please

[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:53.320]
First of all, any from Hollywood, I live on Hollywood Beach

[02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:55.580]
I'm embarrassed that you're a Hollywood resident

[02:27:55.580 --> 02:27:57.060]
Get the hell out

[02:27:57.060 --> 02:28:00.060]
Take good French Canadians and get the hell out of here

[02:28:00.060 --> 02:28:01.720]
Stick one and eat sea, correct them

[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:04.280]
Exactly, and second of all, crispy cream

[02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:08.180]
I got a great show about crispy cream, I thought like you was a local franchise

[02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:10.280]
I should live in North Miami myself

[02:28:11.380 --> 02:28:14.260]
I went to Memphis, Tennessee to see the king, sorry Neil

[02:28:15.020 --> 02:28:23.080]
And down the street from Memphis, believe it or not, and all the schwarz error that it was

[02:28:23.080 --> 02:28:28.360]
The only solace I had was a big blue wiggly and across the street was, crispy cream

[02:28:30.380 --> 02:28:32.240]
That's why Elvis loved that area probably

[02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:33.180]
Probably, I would think so

[02:28:33.180 --> 02:28:35.800]
That's why I got so fed, that is the greatest place in the world

[02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:37.200]
It is, I love it

[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:41.040]
I wish I was your weight about 80 pounds right now, I could get up to 150 by 2 o'clock

[02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:45.180]
Exactly, I used to eat that stuff before the Atkins, thanks to you I lost 40 pounds

[02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:45.520]
Really?

[02:28:45.820 --> 02:28:47.780]
Yes, I've lost a lot of weight

[02:28:47.780 --> 02:28:49.700]
Great, I'm down to 30 weights now

[02:28:49.700 --> 02:28:50.080]
Alright

[02:28:50.580 --> 02:28:52.000]
Can I call people to schwarz?

[02:28:52.140 --> 02:28:55.020]
I'll tell you by the end of the year I look about just like Brad Pitt after I lose all this weight

[02:28:55.020 --> 02:28:55.460]
Go ahead

[02:28:55.460 --> 02:28:57.300]
I look about the older Brad Pitt

[02:28:57.300 --> 02:28:59.220]
There you go, and you get JP there

[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:02.560]
Mike at Tyler Festers, you reduce back and store you one

[02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:03.600]
Okay, thank you Neil

[02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:04.100]
See you

[02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:06.080]
See you at Crispy Cream, baby

[02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:12.020]
Oh, I just opened up the map just leaving through my newsweek and I see that picture and right away

[02:29:12.020 --> 02:29:13.500]
Oh, look at that

[02:29:14.020 --> 02:29:17.940]
And there's even a picture of one of their donuts, one of those glazed donuts

[02:29:17.940 --> 02:29:19.700]
I had a kind of a glazed look in my eye

[02:29:19.700 --> 02:29:22.080]
Because I saw that, Bill Clinton loves them

[02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:24.820]
So I'd buy up all that stock if I were you okay?

[02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:26.240]
I just plunged my lungs out

[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:28.140]
By the way, speaking of that, can I take a look?

[02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:32.560]
I haven't been watching it at all for a long time until I go home and then I get real depressed

[02:29:33.580 --> 02:29:36.140]
Can I just say, oh, there was a scroll Griffith again, how you doing, scroll?

[02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:36.880]
That's my girlfriend

[02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:42.560]
Not too bad so far, but it usually doesn't happen until about three in the afternoon

[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:48.680]
When some asshole from one of the corporations opened up his mouth and says, oh yeah, all these tech stocks are highly overvalued including ours

[02:29:48.680 --> 02:29:52.060]
And we can't figure out why it's going to drop it like a rock now after I open up my big mouth

[02:29:52.060 --> 02:29:54.420]
Do you see that yesterday? The asshole from Microsoft?

[02:29:56.560 --> 02:29:57.260]
Where is that?

[02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:05.480]
Oh, I got it. It opens up a big goddamn mouth and all of a sudden all of the stocks ate

[02:30:05.860 --> 02:30:09.900]
No, not Bill Gates, it was some other, maybe it wasn't Microsoft, it was from one of those

[02:30:10.380 --> 02:30:15.880]
One of those marginal one moment, please

[02:30:17.220 --> 02:30:22.820]
Yeah, Microsoft, it was one of the ass, so it wasn't him, it was some schmuck, ballmer

[02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:32.640]
Yeah, it dropped almost five bucks after you open up his mouth and the market went into a dive into a free fall

[02:30:33.740 --> 02:30:41.080]
And then you know something, those of us who got all this money invested in a stock market, which is supposed to be, you know, for intellectuals, people who really want to make smart investments

[02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:51.560]
It goes to show you when at the maniac Alan Greenspan talked about what was the term about the excessive exuberance of something like that last year

[02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:56.560]
All of a sudden there goes everybody's money in the toilet. This guy from Microsoft and nobody ever heard of

[02:30:56.560 --> 02:30:59.600]
Yesterday he opened up his mouth and there's 200 points in the toilet

[02:31:01.880 --> 02:31:07.120]
Because somebody just makes a comment, a stupid comment because they're not thinking before they open up their mouth and speak

[02:31:10.260 --> 02:31:17.240]
26, oh look at that, now it's down 28, now it's down 24, it's only 130, we got a long way to go, we can get triple digits, no problem again today

[02:31:18.600 --> 02:31:19.720]
Oh god deal

[02:31:23.380 --> 02:31:23.660]
Oh

[02:31:23.660 --> 02:31:25.660]
Oh

[02:31:53.660 --> 02:31:55.660]
Day

[02:32:24.980 --> 02:32:32.740]
I'll be just spend some 12 year old girls to see for as cute as me

[02:32:32.740 --> 02:32:42.080]
Yeah, as they get older they all figure out where hiding our latency

[02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:48.620]
One thing is for sure

[02:32:48.620 --> 02:32:49.840]
Be gay

[02:32:51.080 --> 02:32:53.120]
Man enjoy

[02:32:58.080 --> 02:33:02.080]
Was I close or was the delicate side

[02:33:02.080 --> 02:33:12.060]
Don't want to do a bug

[02:33:12.060 --> 02:33:17.480]
I say we're not gay

[02:33:18.680 --> 02:33:22.060]
I say we're not gay

[02:33:22.740 --> 02:33:28.880]
Oh my god, just when you think you heard the worst possible thing in the history of the human god damn race

[02:33:29.960 --> 02:33:33.520]
When I tell you this and you know something this is the last straw for this kid

[02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:38.180]
This is not what did I tell him when I when they started with his craft when

[02:33:39.680 --> 02:33:43.180]
Run up this garbage trying to bring his buddy in with him again

[02:33:43.180 --> 02:33:43.740]
Oh, man

[02:33:44.340 --> 02:33:46.620]
I said if that's the case I want nothing to do with us

[02:33:46.620 --> 02:33:51.220]
I will I will I remember when we had the first meeting with your close personal friend the dearly departed one

[02:33:51.220 --> 02:33:54.840]
Crazy Kurosato and screw in and screw off

[02:33:56.500 --> 02:34:00.760]
Oh yeah we can get old data I said no if that's the case I'm not going to promote it I don't want nothing to do with it

[02:34:00.760 --> 02:34:02.520]
I bet you said or one doesn't want anything to do with it

[02:34:03.020 --> 02:34:03.660]
Okay, okay

[02:34:03.660 --> 02:34:07.780]
We just had a spy report guess who's at that celebrity golf tournament. Oh man

[02:34:08.900 --> 02:34:12.200]
It's confirmed another another spy report confirming it

[02:34:13.580 --> 02:34:16.520]
Playing at this murdering son of a bitch. Oh man

[02:34:16.520 --> 02:34:25.220]
Is it our golf tournament? I'm gonna tell you I'm just I'm so psychotic I could spit blood on his god damn horseball equipment we got here right now

[02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:37.820]
He's one of the celebrities playing in the tournament when we said specifically we won't have anything to do with this thing if he's invited

[02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:53.480]
This is so freaking unacceptable. I'm just I'm just spellbound. I'm speechless that even a place with no conscience like this joy

[02:34:53.940 --> 02:34:59.760]
Because like I told you a million times it's not a radio station. It's not a real business. It's a goddamn fraternity

[02:35:00.440 --> 02:35:05.780]
You got Greg and his buddies Greg and screw in and Sam and the nephew and what's his name?

[02:35:05.820 --> 02:35:14.140]
Roll kind of rubbed off on him too I guess and that's it and they did it's a little play toy for these people and basically they lie and they do whatever they want

[02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:22.700]
And here's our program director like how what's this and nobody's told him I know I know that we're not blaming you for it don't get defensive

[02:35:22.700 --> 02:35:30.320]
I'm sure you had because I like that. So you're not part of the club if I would have had any idea I would have never read one promo

[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:38.920]
I would have never got I would have called my friends in center one and said whatever you do make sure that you have nothing to do with this because we don't want to be associated with that murdering son of a bitch

[02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:44.880]
Just because we got a bunch of people in this radio station who got some kind of a fetish some kind of an obsession with this little tick

[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:51.000]
Once again wq and comes up looking like crap looking like a bunch of dummies

[02:35:54.220 --> 02:36:06.080]
God then it's just it's unconscionable like they really needed that right they only had a couple of fortunes left and whatever they had all this long list of names and by the way you'll notice in the promos that they gave us there were all these other names that I read

[02:36:07.140 --> 02:36:12.700]
Was OJ's name ever on that list? No of course not because it was supposed to be a big dark secret

[02:36:19.100 --> 02:36:26.060]
Oh, you don't forget George and OJ will be appearing at the prime co-storied together tomorrow from noon to two. Oh, OJ can't make it. Oh, what a shame.

[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:35.260]
There'll be in the awkward plaza at the prime co from noon to two and Hollywood tomorrow just east of us sterling or sure not fine on the five and we'll have the QAM wheel to spin.

[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:40.620]
In fact, maybe we'll have OJ nailed to their wheel and you can spin him a little bit. That would get a big turn out.

[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:51.340]
Oh, I'm going to, you know, I just when you get to the point where you think nothing that you could hear about this place whatever shock you, amazing disappoint you, degrade you all of a sudden this.

[02:36:52.260 --> 02:36:59.700]
This is the lowest moment I would say even back in the days when Joey Reynolds was here and they old points they had minus ratings on his station under the previous owners.

[02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:08.680]
This is the lowest moment in the history of WQA and right now. So are you sure you don't want to talk to OJ? Who is that?

[02:37:13.820 --> 02:37:15.060]
Guess Sam. Yes.

[02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:21.140]
He's listening. He's loving it. I sure you don't want to talk to him.

[02:37:22.240 --> 02:37:31.760]
To OJ. This isn't the joke. Right. And we don't want to talk to OJ. We don't want anything to do with OJ. This isn't the joke. This is a radio station. This is a business which Sam you would know nothing about.

[02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:47.260]
This is what happens when you turn a multi billion dollar business over to a bunch of children. They take it and they use it as their own play toy. How many times have I said that on here? How many tirades have I gone through?

[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:57.600]
And told it exactly the way it is here. I have never in my life in a history of my existence. I have never even imagined much less scene the kinds of things that go on here.

[02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:12.340]
In addition to which I would appreciate if you would tell him to stop calling you on that line unless we got real business to do. It's not a play toy for Sam. That's also given the phone to other people out there and giving the inside line here to play games with us today. He said he didn't do that. Yeah. Sure.

[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:19.460]
Totally out of control. This place has spawned out of control.

[02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:32.300]
What did I tell you? They don't like prosperity. Got all that billing coming in here even though we have to give it all to John Henry and Wayne but we got all that money rolling in here. All those big numbers for the time being anyway.

[02:38:34.500 --> 02:38:35.840]
Till they all move over to 1700.

[02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:56.420]
See, I don't take it as a joke. I don't talk to murderers. The people who were found guilty in the civil trial who were found responsible for the murder of two innocent people. I don't talk to those people.

[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:13.300]
I don't have any desperate need in my life. I don't feel so. And of course there we were with Sam again who's always the how many times have I said this and appendage. If he can just being near if he can be around anybody famous or infamous it makes no difference. Then it makes him feel like he has an identity like he's a real human being which he's not.

[02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:22.300]
21 before 2 at 560 WQM.

[02:40:26.260 --> 02:40:28.200]
Oh day when I was going to get her.

[02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:57.020]
Oh day when I was going to kill her.

[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:26.000]
Oh day when I was going to get her.

[02:41:34.740 --> 02:41:35.640]
Oh day.

[02:41:49.260 --> 02:42:00.300]
Oh day.

[02:42:00.300 --> 02:42:22.300]
Oh day.

[02:42:22.300 --> 02:42:45.660]
Oh day.

[02:42:45.660 --> 02:43:06.080]
Oh day.

[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:30.020]
Oh day.

[02:43:35.880 --> 02:43:38.400]
Oh day.

[02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:56.400]
Oh day.

[02:43:56.400 --> 02:44:11.280]
Oh day.

[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:17.380]
Oh day.

[02:44:17.380 --> 02:44:42.140]
Oh day.

[02:44:42.140 --> 02:45:00.140]
Oh day.

[02:45:00.140 --> 02:45:18.140]
Oh day.

[02:45:18.140 --> 02:45:36.140]
Oh day.

[02:45:43.440 --> 02:46:01.440]
Oh day.

[02:46:08.780 --> 02:46:26.780]
Oh day.

[02:46:26.780 --> 02:46:44.780]
Oh day.
