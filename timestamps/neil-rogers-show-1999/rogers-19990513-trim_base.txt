[00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.560]
Sport radio 560, are they out of the crew already?

[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.860]
They're two on a cover, my car.

[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.120]
The Neil Rogers.

[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.740]
How are they?

[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.340]
I think they're out of the material.

[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.240]
That's why I sent all of the sign with the SAC-2.

[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.440]
Free for date and brown.

[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.900]
Or pound 560.

[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.300]
A 500 box, D-Holl, you lose that much.

[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.680]
The first race and highly in there.

[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.280]
Anywhere else?

[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.480]
On the show, do not necessarily reflect those of WQAM.

[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.820]
Beasley read acquisitions.

[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.560]
Or, they'll be using broadcast group.

[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.760]
Now, Neil Rogers on Sport radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.380]
At agency people are assholes.

[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.820]
You know that Neil Rogers is the one.

[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.840]
And he doesn't listen to shows.

[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.840]
So we won't hear this.

[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.220]
Probably get it from George Lee.

[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.960]
He hears it sometimes.

[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.880]
Up Lindsey, somehow he's the...

[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.220]
Man, it is.

[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.180]
Listen to every word, switch and CDs.

[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.420]
And they must be short CDs.

[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.120]

[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.440]
But anyway, Neil Rogers is the first one to rail away

[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.980]
about professional courtesy and about being a professional

[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.100]
in the radio industry.

[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.320]
Right?

[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.200]
The music's blasting down the hall.

[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.160]
No, you're up there, Hickie.

[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.160]
He's starting the other thing.

[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.440]
Salesman comes in and erupts from during the show.

[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.160]
A word is misspelled in the ad copy.

[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.880]
And Neil Rogers is going crazy.

[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.980]
A rip in this guy to shreds his family the whole thing.

[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.120]
So yesterday I come to find out that a fact

[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.400]
that was supposed to be sent to me by not more

[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.580]
giving some details of where I'm supposed to be tonight

[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.760]
is sent to the wrong fax machine.

[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.580]
I guess not more call the switchboard.

[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.460]
And that's the number you got.

[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.340]
And Neil reads the facts on here.

[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.860]
Which is fine.

[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.980]
That's part of his thing, whatever.

[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.560]
I'm sure he appreciates that if it was the other way around.

[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.840]
And then at the same time,

[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.760]
you would figure out a professional courtesy

[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.320]
that the gathered of these details

[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.140]
were important to me.

[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.960]
And at least return it to my box,

[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.280]
which I do have a clearly label box here at the radio station.

[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.660]
Yeah.

[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.860]
So I was George.

[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.340]
I said, hey, George, you got that fax.

[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.620]
I got to find out what I'm doing tonight.

[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.140]
So the guy was going to fact me some information.

[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.920]
I understand that Neil intercepted it.

[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.340]
And it turns out he tore it up and threw it in the garbage.

[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080]
So you're pissed off at Neil because he did that.

[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.560]
Well, is that professional courtesy?

[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.540]
This is the man.

[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.780]
This is the poster child for professionalism in the radio industry.

[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.800]
And I told Dufflin Z.

[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.980]
And I'm going to yell at him.

[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.300]
Sit down and have a conversation with Neil.

[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.540]

[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.700]
Get this way to work.

[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.160]
Think out.

[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.820]
That'll be good.

[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.800]
Yeah, I don't even mind if I have the piece of thing together

[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.480]
like a ransom.

[00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.140]
Yeah.

[00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.140]
I'm working here.

[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.440]
I'm trying to earn a living, whatever.

[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.080]
You can say whatever you're one about me.

[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.640]
I'm a professional courtesy from the guy that rails away the most.

[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.880]
I mean, who gets more upset than Neil

[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.340]
if something doesn't done professionally.

[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.680]
So basically calling him the hypocrite.

[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.260]
That's what you're saying.

[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.220]
You use the words by 6705.

[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.340]
What are you scared to use the word?

[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.260]
You think he's a hypocrite?

[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.360]
Say he's a hypocrite.

[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.320]
No, I don't even know if he's a hypocrite because you know what?

[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.460]
As long as you're a hypocrite.

[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.040]
And the word that is why he feels about people, see?

[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.460]
Which means you're a hypocrite.

[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.080]
No, that's the next one.

[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.980]
You're a hypocrite.

[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.600]
See because you have to do it right.

[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.960]
If you're going to be the first to do it right.

[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.500]
I don't even think he's worthy of being a hypocrite.

[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.520]
I think he's consistent.

[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.580]
He just doesn't give a crap about anybody else, which is fine.

[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.120]
But then don't be crying.

[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.600]
Don't go running down the Greg Reads office the next time the music is playing too loud

[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.500]
from power 96.

[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.400]
All right, because they don't have any more professional courtesy than you do.

[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.020]
Neil, right.

[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.980]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.200]
The most astonishing part of the whole thing.

[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.540]
He must be maybe when you start ballooning up like that, you know, because I've been

[00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.460]
fat for many, many years.

[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.400]
So it doesn't bother me as far as my brain is concerned.

[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.340]
But when you start ballooning up like that and get real porky, it starts affecting

[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.500]
your mind and your memory, your short-term memory starts going.

[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.860]
I was talking about this on the air yesterday.

[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.820]
We had the crossover.

[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.300]
And as far as my intercepting your facts, Beful, which he's at least seven yards away

[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.240]
by the way, but don't have the balls to come and look me in the face and talk about this.

[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.840]
But as far as intercepting the facts, the facts machine is like five feet behind me here.

[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.600]
All the facts that come to this number come to me right in this room.

[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.820]
It's not like intercepting.

[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.180]
I read it on the air.

[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.620]
We had a little crossover for whatever reason yesterday.

[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.020]
And I mentioned that the time.

[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.480]
I guess what?

[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.620]
Here's a fact from that more about, and I'm going to read it on the air.

[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.460]
And he, haha, haha, did he say I need that by the way?

[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.900]
Please say that for me.

[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.600]
All the facts said was to reiterate that he's going to be there tonight and we agreed on

[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.540]
a $500 fee.

[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.480]
And here's a list of the other 72,000 people that are going to be there.

[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.480]
Dan Moreno, Don Chula, Bill Clinton, Abe Lincoln, FDR.

[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.080]
Everybody was ever born to be there.

[00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.840]
And here's this.

[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.160]
Did he say he needed it?

[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.420]
No.

[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.460]
Save that for me.

[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.720]
No.

[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.200]
Like I intercepted this.

[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.760]
Like there was something surreptitious about the way I did this.

[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.160]
Like I sneaked in here in the middle of the night or something and intercepted a fact

[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.780]
when I talked about this on the air with him yesterday.

[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.640]
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.120]
See, it must be really desperate there.

[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.140]
You know, because let's face it, that scoreball is really boring.

[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.460]
You know, I mean, everybody knows that.

[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.680]
It's for rush marches.

[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.780]
And there's nothing else going on.

[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.460]
Nobody cares about the Marlins, which they finally figured out.

[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.940]
They know nothing about hockey.

[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.120]
I mean, you know, there were two playoff games last night.

[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.300]
They know nothing about that.

[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.900]
So what's there to talk about?

[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.720]
So let's just rip Neal and ask, which is fine with me.

[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.920]
I have no problem with that.

[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.980]
But it's part of the professional, as important as concerned and professional courtesy.

[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.620]
D-4, you just had bad luck.

[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.500]
It was the wrong day.

[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.440]
That ended the day D-4.

[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.440]
Didn't I come on air yesterday and say, in fact, I finally adopted the attitude you're

[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.620]
supposed to have around here.

[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.220]
After a year and a half of fighting and I finally said,

[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.560]
I don't give a sh** anymore.

[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.280]
And there you go.

[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.920]
And I was in the happiest mood of my life yesterday.

[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.280]
I'm rolling along.

[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.840]
I mean, that's the way they all are.

[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.560]
I mean, they don't seem to mind if they're blasting the music down the hallway.

[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.880]
Either the word I'm using is pussy, of course.

[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.840]
They're just too terrified to go down and say,

[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.880]
cut the crap because we're trying to do a showdown here.

[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.860]
But, you know, the excuse is, well, we don't care.

[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.860]
We're just not going to be into that crap.

[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.760]
Well, let Neal be the crap disturber.

[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.900]
But that all I did yesterday.

[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.260]
I just, I don't give a sh** anymore.

[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.520]
Right.

[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.480]
So it's just bad luck on your part, D-4,

[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.260]
because I just don't care about these things anymore.

[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.020]
So it just unfortunate that it was on your own.

[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.240]
And not only that, but don't feel like I singled you up.

[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.300]
Because every single fact that has come here to this machine

[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.980]
for the sports people, I've done the same thing.

[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.480]
You're the witness.

[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.040]
I tear them all up and throw them away.

[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.920]
And as far as professional courtesy is concerned,

[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.500]
the professional thing to do would be

[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.640]
give all your people with your other 85 jobs,

[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.040]
give them the right facts number to contact you.

[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.640]
And stop wasting our facts paper in here.

[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.420]
We got enough assholes out there to waste their facts paper every day.

[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.780]
Seriously, if I had the money that it cost to chop down all the trees

[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.540]
to, you know, to make the paper for all the facts paper

[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.620]
that gets wasted in here, I could retire right now.

[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.660]
I could get out of there here.

[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.700]
But I understand it.

[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.140]
I didn't hear any of your show this morning.

[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.820]
We had little spy reports when I came in that people were psychotic

[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.200]
about that facts, about the net board thing,

[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.440]
that were the 4,500 other celebrities tonight.

[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.960]
And the 500 bucks he's going to make,

[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.760]
which he'll lose in two races in Halea.

[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.620]
That's a bit of a poll question, by the way.

[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.300]
I was asking Joe Costello this and I had a tough question.

[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.760]
Which one of the following three here at our station?

[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.020]
Do you think loses a higher percentage of his income?

[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.240]
I'm not talking about actual dollars,

[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.360]
because there's no great disparity as far as the incomes of the three people.

[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.660]
But which one of the following three do you think loses a higher percentage of his income?

[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.120]
Any K, D-Full or the Humper?

[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.120]

[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.240]
That's a tough question.

[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.840]
That was from?

[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.820]
Yeah, well, easy come easy go, I guess.

[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.580]
That's interesting to think about.

[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.260]
Huh? Would you have any thoughts on that?

[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.020]
You're going to have to make them actually make money?

[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:03.960]
Gambling?

[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.320]
No, no, no.

[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.680]
No, no.

[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.720]
I don't know any explanation.

[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.700]
I know one person, one person in my life,

[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.600]
who I believe makes money gambling,

[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.720]
and that's Ron Bash.

[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.200]
He was at Pompeville last night.

[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.940]
I mean, this guy, that's what he does for a living.

[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.000]
He's a professional gambler.

[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.840]
And I mean, he really plunges it in,

[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.540]
but he was kind of quiet there last night at Pompeville Park.

[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.540]
He was like, you know, usually it's, hey, all right, you.

[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.620]
Pretty quiet there.

[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.060]
I think things that the medallins couldn't have gone to good last night,

[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.420]
Rami, so he made an early exit.

[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.000]
But no, he's a good guy.

[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.280]
But I think he makes money.

[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.760]
Fat Rich doesn't make money?

[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.100]
No.

[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.520]
He will tell you that he makes money.

[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.720]
No, no, seriously, I mean Rich is a great guy.

[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.540]
He's a good friend of mine, but he's got this thing.

[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.400]
It's an ego thing.

[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.520]
He will tell you like when we left there last night,

[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.820]
I always tell you exactly.

[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.640]
If I lost 80 bucks, I'm not a big game.

[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.460]
I won 30 bucks last night.

[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:56.820]
Okay?

[00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.540]
To the penny, I won 30 dollars.

[00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.860]
And he says his were leaving.

[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.560]
Yeah, I think that's about what I did, too.

[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.820]
If I would have said, I lost 20 bucks, he would have said,

[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.780]
yeah, I think I, you know, because that's just a thing.

[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.760]
It's an ego thing because he went through that period of time

[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.640]
like we all have, where he was hot as a pistol.

[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:10.940]
Remember?

[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.500]
I mean, he was, he couldn't tear up a ticket.

[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.500]
He was, uh, winning like crazy for about a year and a half.

[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.240]
And then all of a sudden the bubble burst.

[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.420]
And he came back to the real world.

[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.180]
By the way, he told D-Full I got a fast form.

[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.000]
Don't we have it?

[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:28.540]
Wait a minute.

[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.300]
Here's another copy of the fast form.

[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.040]
Oh, geez, look at that.

[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:34.520]
Oh, Christ.

[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.240]
They refactor thing from that work.

[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.280]
And I threw it up before I realized what it was.

[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.320]
God damn it.

[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.420]
What a jackass, you know?

[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.660]
I don't give a sh** anymore.

[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.280]
Yeah, me either.

[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.700]
Hey, listen, you know, the 500 bucks he would get for doing that thing.

[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.700]
I just imagine all the food he'd buy and how fat he'd be.

[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.740]
I'm trying to save his life.

[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.060]
I'm trying to save this man's life.

[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.560]
He's ballooning up just like the booster.

[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.700]
That's going to be the next poll.

[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.820]
Which one of those at the end of the year is going to weigh the most?

[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.060]
He is getting right in that category every day.

[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.480]
When you can actually, you know, when you see somebody every day,

[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.360]
you don't notice mild nuances in the change of their appearance.

[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.300]
But with him, now that we're up here on the third floor,

[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.340]
I see him every day, you can see the expansion every day.

[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.480]
It's like watching them build a sawgrass, which I did.

[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.440]
You know, every day, you see a little more, a little more,

[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.480]
a few more bricks here.

[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:18.860]
Man, oh man.

[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.600]
Boy, oh boy.

[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.320]
He must be really more reckoned in the big bucks.

[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.900]
So what's he wanted about so much?

[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:24.940]
What does he want?

[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.680]
And life must be really good, as he says.

[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.460]
Maybe even cash to bet this year.

[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.060]
Oh, I got all kinds of good stuff today.

[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:33.640]
All kinds of good stuff.

[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.340]
And don't let them rip off to me.

[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.740]
Ten minutes past 10 is 560 WQAM.

[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.560]
I don't have to grow up.

[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.480]
I'm a Dunzer of kids.

[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.140]
So I can always feel myself for something bad I did.

[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.700]
It's going to be cool when I kill everyone at school.

[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.380]
Cause my dad said it's okay.

[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.980]
I'll exercise my rights.

[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.900]
That's why we have an R.A.

[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.560]
That lets me be a Dunzer of kids.

[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.980]
He becomes a usb.

[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.740]
I told him how to shoot.

[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.200]
Well, he really loves the side of what?

[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:06.620]
No way.

[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.560]
That kind of cute.

[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.460]
I'm a homestead.

[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.680]
I'll not see red next to the side on the internet.

[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.060]
I'm a lifetime member of the NRA.

[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.020]
That's why I raise a Gunzer of kids.

[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:21.800]
Oh, right.

[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.720]
Oh boy, I quit this in my gun.

[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.360]
I'll play that Laura.

[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.040]
Gunzer of kids.

[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.160]
And agency people I raise.

[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.140]
Okay, just a reminder in case you forgot.

[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.360]
1015 is 560 WQAM.

[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.660]
Yeah, the Republican Party, by the way,

[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.700]
you know that thing about mom and,

[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:41.540]
how does it go?

[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.000]
Apple pie, mom and Chevrolet.

[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.260]
Remember that is American as,

[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.360]
well, not that Republican Party has got their own kind of motto.

[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.240]
They stand for guns, God and hate.

[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.580]
That's the new Republican Party.

[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.320]
Thank God that the NRA was able to influence those Republicans

[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.120]
in the Senate yesterday so they could vote down at Bill.

[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.860]
Because God forbid we should have mandatory out a federal level,

[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.780]
mandatory background checks that those great gun shows.

[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:05.940]
God forbid.

[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.380]
We'll get to the OJ story in a minute,

[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.480]
by the way, speaking of slaughter.

[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.920]
I don't even know where to start,

[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.380]
but let's go back to the end yesterday.

[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.260]
You know, we have a lot of well-meaning people out there,

[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.560]
and then we have some assholes too.

[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.200]
But how can you take something as simple as the transaction

[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.020]
I made yesterday and turn it into something so psychotic

[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.740]
and everybody, even though they mean well,

[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:26.940]
they don't know what they're talking about.

[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.820]
I've had this happen so many times over the years.

[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:30.840]
You ask a question.

[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.140]
I mean, if I don't know, I'll be the first one to tell you.

[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.480]
I never had a CD burner before, okay?

[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.120]
I got a great Panasonic right now,

[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.740]
which that transaction yesterday,

[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.240]
and it wasn't Boka Bryant's fault.

[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.720]
It was definitely the people at that same ash place,

[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.220]
whatever that is, that ash hole over there.

[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.560]
That was the problem.

[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:46.620]
There was no problem.

[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.400]
He set up for them to get some nice free publicity,

[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.780]
for them to get some business.

[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.180]
I wasn't looking for a wholesale.

[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.640]
You know, you need to retail price,

[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.780]
whatever anybody else off the street would pay for it,

[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:56.960]
and give them a little plug,

[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.540]
and quite frankly, to show you how slow I am,

[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.000]
I never heard of them before.

[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.060]
Other sandmash stores in the town,

[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.100]
were hauling up saying,

[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.080]
oh, you should have come to us.

[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.140]
We would have been over backwards.

[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.440]
We would have delivered it personally.

[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.040]
So I haven't only had the one up there at large,

[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.560]
where they had the actual problem.

[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.180]
Because the other ones...

[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.320]
And I don't know, like I said,

[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.440]
I never heard of them before.

[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.640]
And besides one guy who wasn't there,

[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.580]
they had two days.

[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.560]
They never heard of you either.

[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.580]
So anyway, to make a long story short,

[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.940]
here I get the thing in here yesterday,

[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.840]
Boka Bryant paid, which by the way,

[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.240]
I wanted to pay with a check,

[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.120]
and they turned down,

[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:28.900]
it wouldn't take his check.

[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.120]
He paid with a credit card,

[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.500]
which I guess they didn't bother to check.

[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.480]
But at any rate,

[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.920]
and so then I gave him a check here yesterday,

[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.100]
and it's all paid forward done.

[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.440]
Nobody left town with the equipment,

[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.020]
you know, $600 piece of equipment,

[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.100]
which they send here.

[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.160]
And I wanted to buy a bunch of blank CDs on there,

[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.420]
you know, it would be like,

[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.700]
if you bought your first BCR 25 years ago,

[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.520]
and you know, there was one blank tape.

[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.840]
And of course, back in those days,

[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.020]
they wouldn't give you a blank tape,

[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.400]
but it would be like a real short one, you know,

[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.400]
like a 30-minute job,

[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.840]
like a demo kind of a thing.

[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.440]
And you'd have to go out and buy your own damn blank tape.

[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:01.920]
And it would be like,

[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.940]
so if you said to the guy at this sound advice,

[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:05.640]
or wherever it was,

[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.340]
okay, I want to buy the BCR,

[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.200]
and I want to buy 20 blank VHS tapes,

[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.220]
or beta, whatever you bought.

[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.380]
And it's, oh, well, we know you can't get those.

[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:13.820]
We know him.

[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.920]
And you'd go, crap, I mean, what is that?

[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:18.720]
What's the point?

[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.260]
And so the last part of the show yesterday,

[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.480]
I mean, turned into this big, psychotic thing,

[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.740]
and everybody meant well,

[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:26.980]
including Blufflin,

[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.100]
the Ubering's being a CD this morning,

[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.380]
which I appreciate profusely,

[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.700]
a TDK,

[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.660]
a recordable CD,

[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.220]
CDRXG74 for musical,

[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.100]
and a yaddy-oddy-oddy,

[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.180]
and it's got the logo,

[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.080]
yeah, I've got new times,

[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:39.920]
we're way ahead of you, Greg.

[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.200]
We don't miss a beat here, okay?

[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.520]
And tell D-photogate his own goddamn faxes.

[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:44.860]
But at any rate, so anyway,

[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.200]
compact, dis-digital audio recordable,

[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.340]
that's what it has to say on the disc.

[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.100]
And that's it.

[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.460]
I read the manual with my machine yesterday.

[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.980]
It doesn't say anything about it's got to be a Phillips disc,

[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.080]
and we had people calling in here yesterday saying,

[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.260]
oh, no, you can't just buy any other disc.

[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.500]
It has to be a Phillips disc.

[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:01.960]
Remember that?

[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.120]
Now, stop and think of the logic in that.

[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.220]
When you've got your first cassette recorder,

[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.500]
okay, maybe it was a Sony.

[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.180]
Did that mean?

[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.300]
Because Max L, I hate to record the news to you,

[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.360]
TDK and Max L, they don't make cassette decks,

[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.640]
or CD burners.

[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.740]
They don't make the hardware.

[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.800]
They make only the software, right?

[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.600]
That would be like saying, if you got a CD cassette deck,

[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.920]
you can only play and record CDs made by Sony in there.

[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.020]
And everybody would go, yeah, right.

[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.040]
And the same is true with this.

[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.180]
You look at your reading the manual.

[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.460]
It's always a lot better to read the instruction manual

[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.780]
than listen to people calling in with all their bull crowd.

[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.380]
I mean, I know that guy, that's revolutionary,

[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.300]
but it's always better to read the,

[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.140]
because the people at Phillips say,

[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.760]
who invented CDs, by the way.

[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:47.860]
Did you know that?

[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.120]
Yes, it's in the manual.

[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:49.980]
They're very proud of it.

[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.060]
And the fact that they're from a Holland mix and even better.

[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.400]
But they tell you that, here's the logo.

[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.960]
And as long as this logo was on there, you can use these CDs to record on.

[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.620]
There was a Phillips CD that came in here.

[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.900]
So now I'm running around frantically all over.

[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.680]
I go to Best Buy, I go to Circuit City,

[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.840]
I go all over the place that they have the Phillips stuff.

[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.340]
No, no, but they got always other ones.

[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.980]
And I look in the manual, I see that if it's got the logo on there,

[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.300]
so I go back to Best Buy, I get a whole bunch of these.

[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:14.820]
What are these?

[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.160]
What the hell is it?

[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.080]
One moment please.

[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.720]
Where the hell are they?

[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.320]
Christ, what an eye-d-

[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.360]
Who's-

[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:23.840]
Oh, here they are.

[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.460]
Yeah, they're Memorex.

[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.280]
Now Memorex don't make CD decks, do they?

[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:28.760]
No.

[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.160]
Do they make stereos?

[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:30.400]
No.

[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:30.760]
No.

[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.120]
No.

[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.700]
But they, and it's a CDR, 74.DA,

[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.660]
and it's got the little logo on there, you know,

[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.200]
a recordable digital audio, etc.

[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.000]
And that's it!

[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:41.960]
And guess what?

[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.060]
They work just fine.

[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.920]
I see the smell of the night,

[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.040]
I don't know the smell of the people here.

[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.860]
They have a script that can really sing, man.

[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.900]
I'll be spooky, spooky guys today.

[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.160]
I see the smell of the night.

[00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.480]
That's one of these.

[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.660]
So it's like, I'm gonna give you a wee bit of my life.

[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.860]
It is Christ and you quit clearer.

[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.820]
You can almost put it all up, we can't even rent.

[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:14.380]
Rang is one.

[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.120]
Let's have a spin.

[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.600]
Time to look at some of my brothers' drawings.

[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.240]
And you'll be people I ran.

[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.260]
Don't let them be people.

[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:30.500]
Oh.

[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.580]
I didn't know it was in Indian.

[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.200]
But at any rate, so there's a little Louise.

[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.080]
I'm glad that I selected that Louise

[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.520]
thing to play off that particular CD

[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.140]
that I burned right there in my house.

[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.040]
I burned one in a CD too.

[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.140]
And I'm pretty glad to improv.

[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.180]
I am psyched.

[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.900]
I'm whipped up to a frenzy about it.

[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.460]
I'm so happy.

[00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.900]
Even though I had to go through all the bull crap yesterday,

[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.780]
it made, I guess, for some entertaining crap.

[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.160]
You know, killed a couple of hours.

[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.140]
Got both a Brian suicidal.

[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.080]
As if he's not already manic enough without any,

[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.080]
I mean, what are they blaming him for?

[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.140]
And then we get the facts from that malcontent guy,

[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:12.920]
whatever his name was.

[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.340]
Mal, Mel, blaming him again.

[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:15.640]
Mel.

[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.180]
Yeah.

[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.420]
Mel content.

[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.680]
Probably works for some ad agency on the side.

[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.100]
And he's blaming the old, wasn't me, it was bull.

[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.300]
Well, you know, we know you're trying to save your job now, okay?

[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.240]
No problem.

[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.380]
It's a great piece of equipment.

[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.100]
I have no problem with it at all.

[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.300]
And as far as any shortage of these disc memorets,

[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.180]
whatever, you know,

[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.800]
it's even a lot and get them anywhere, okay?

[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.900]
They got millions of them.

[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.640]
Like there's some shortage of these, like these people calling in

[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.780]
or yesterday at the end of the end of the end,

[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.460]
and Bluff, who meant well, but of course he's a little behind the times.

[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.520]
If you haven't noticed, he's, you know, about 10 days late

[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.920]
and 200 years short.

[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.240]
How's his death coming?

[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:50.560]
No.

[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.000]
Okay.

[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.480]
But I mean, he meant well, but he's telling me they're

[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.520]
all really expensive and they're $7 a piece,

[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.700]
and you got to get him by mail order,

[00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.880]
and he brings me in a number this morning.

[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.540]
And I show him I got a whole bunch of these memorets ones here,

[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:03.820]
and they sound great.

[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.100]
Yeah, what's that?

[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:05.520]

[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:06.360]
What's that?

[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:06.460]

[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:06.860]
Right.

[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.660]
What a piece of equipment.

[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.420]
It's a gem of the only piece.

[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.060]
You want to buy one, I want to buy some cheap CDs?

[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.640]
Now don't be pirate in your CDs, okay?

[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.540]
Goddamn it.

[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.720]
Don't be doing this now and getting CDs

[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.620]
and then making copies and giving them to your friends

[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.940]
because that's really bad.

[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.620]
Let's get this roll.

[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.360]
That's the repair.

[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:31.520]
Yeah.

[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:32.520]
You got to get this.

[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.240]
You got to get this.

[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.680]
You got to get this.

[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:36.980]
You got to get this.

[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.980]
PUNIN and their pants that you guys are all going to be doing

[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.640]
and instead of everybody going out and buying, you know,

[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.060]
for 12 or 15 or 18 bucks, the original CD that you're going to be doing that.

[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.220]
Stop doing those things.

[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.760]
So that takes care of that one little problem there.

[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.320]
Nice going.

[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:49.960]
Congratulations.

[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:50.820]
Excellent.

[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.880]
Thank you, Volker Brian.

[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.340]
Even though you had to go through a very traumatic and I apologize to him,

[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.980]
I don't apologize to D-Full because D-Full don't need that $500.

[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.480]
Those horses are getting plenty of hay without all that help from him.

[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.580]
The $500 and he's not going to wind up not going to that thing.

[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.400]
I mean, with all the contacts that he's got,

[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:12.180]
all these sports flunkies we got running around,

[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.640]
they can't get a hold of that more.

[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.520]
Who the hell is he kidding?

[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.020]
He just wants to make it into a big consulib.

[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.060]
Another reason to start ripping the crap out of me

[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.500]
is because I said he's getting gigantic.

[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.300]
I'm concerned about him.

[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.060]
This crap that I don't care about other people,

[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.480]
if I didn't care about other people,

[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.180]
would I be concerned about Boobshambi?

[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.700]
I barely know Boobshambi.

[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.460]
And I don't dislike him.

[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:33.480]
He's a good talent.

[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.280]
He's got a good voice.

[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.080]
He knows his crap.

[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.420]
He does a great job on those Marlon games.

[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:38.460]
I like the Bookshambi.

[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.820]
I would just like to see him live beyond the age of 25, whatever the hell he is, you know?

[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.340]
And the same with D-Full.

[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.460]
I've known this guy for 20 years for Christ's sake.

[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.660]
He was always basically the same.

[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.420]
He was never fat.

[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.060]
He was never slim.

[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.700]
He was a little on the slim side, actually.

[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.180]
And he's ballooning up like a monster.

[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.700]
He is killing himself.

[00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.560]
And the reason he's killing himself,

[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.060]
and he's able to afford those big fattening luxurious meals,

[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.340]
is because he's making all the money on the side doing all of these things.

[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.500]
All this extraneous stuff he's into.

[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.020]
Everybody look.

[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:09.740]
There he is.

[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.480]
He's got that Saturday morning, the Sony, or whatever sports challenge.

[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.880]
See, there's a plug for a D-Full.

[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.540]
Do I listen to it?

[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:14.700]
No.

[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.260]
But nevertheless.

[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.640]
And he shows on Whammy and those.

[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.600]
Every TV state on sports channels, sunshine.

[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.720]
Everywhere you look.

[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.420]
There he is with Kimba Bojangles.

[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:24.920]
And they got another.

[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.100]
I don't think he'd be graduating, you know, often.

[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.720]
But he's eating himself to death with all that cash.

[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.700]
That he's not the part that he's not losing it to track.

[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.420]
Whatever he's left over.

[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:37.700]
Here's Homestead.

[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:37.940]
Hello.

[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:39.780]
Well, Neil?

[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:40.340]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:41.220]
How are you doing today?

[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:41.560]
Great.

[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:42.400]
Good.

[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.620]
Let me ask you something about the heat game and the New York game.

[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:45.940]
Okay.

[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.860]
Let's go to Fort Lauderdale, huh?

[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.600]
Neil, what's up?

[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:51.420]
How you doing, sir?

[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.700]
Hey, can you believe that?

[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.820]
Can you believe that, call, sir?

[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.900]
Can you believe what a jackass we got to start the show today?

[00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:57.720]
That's the second thing.

[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.100]
I hate to follow that.

[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.640]
Hey, about the D-Full thing.

[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.060]
I'm listening to both sides now.

[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:03.500]
I'm listening to both sides.

[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.320]
Both sides now.

[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.040]
I think you did the wrong thing, everybody.

[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:08.800]
No, I did not.

[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.660]
But about guns too.

[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:11.560]
Let me say it again.

[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.380]
I didn't do the wrong thing, but because you were a gun lover,

[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.340]
therefore we wanted to get out of here.

[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:14.620]
No, I didn't.

[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:15.600]
Well, just a little bit.

[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:15.600]

[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.100]
It sounds like it.

[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.000]
Is that where you're going with this?

[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:17.580]
Yeah.

[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:18.520]
Aha, I knew it.

[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.680]
How did I know that?

[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:20.960]
How did I know that?

[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.340]
See, if I would have said that the NRA was great, you would have said,

[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.700]
nice going there, tearing up that fax on these things.

[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.400]
No, it's not very good.

[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.620]
You're just a suckle with nature.

[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:28.240]
Let me make a point.

[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:28.540]
Go ahead.

[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:29.060]
All right.

[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.100]
Just a suckle, but go ahead.

[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.580]
Stay at the pet, and feel care.

[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.420]
Stay at the pet, and feel care.

[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.220]
You can see what?

[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.100]
Carey laws.

[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.760]
You can see your carry laws.

[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.900]
See, you gun violence rates dropped 30%.

[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:39.740]
How do you explain that?

[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.060]
Just the fact that you're going to see it again.

[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.880]
I don't know what the fact is.

[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.000]
I don't even know what you just said.

[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:45.800]
You can see your carry laws.

[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:46.700]
Do you like them or not?

[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.140]
Can see your carry laws?

[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:48.980]
You know what that is?

[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.760]
You mean in other words, let you carry a concealed weapon?

[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.060]
Right.

[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.560]
And you think that everybody should walk around with a concealed weapon?

[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.080]
Violence.

[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.780]
Gun violence goes down 30%.

[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:57.320]
Yeah, right.

[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:57.920]
It does.

[00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:58.940]
You look it up, idiot.

[00:21:59.180 --> 00:21:59.760]
Yeah, look it up.

[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:00.540]
You look it up.

[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:01.560]
You look it up.

[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.400]
Stick it up your ass, idiot.

[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:04.760]
That's right.

[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.660]
If everybody had a gun and a holster on their thing, like the old Wild West, idiot.

[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.400]
See, that's what I'm saying right off the bat.

[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.120]
I knew it immediately.

[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.800]
As soon as he, yeah, it takes to, you know, wants to take a shot at me.

[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.840]
Yeah, you did the wrong thing there and they goes in.

[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:16.640]
It was gun-loving thing.

[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.200]
D-fo, you can have that guy, okay?

[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:18.980]
He's one of your people.

[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:21.360]
Asshole.

[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.980]
Not D-fo, this guy.

[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.640]
Well, 26 after 10 at 560, WQM, Hollywood.

[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.200]
Holy mackinon!

[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.800]
This is Joe Bowen, the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and you're listening to the Hockey Authority, Neil God!

[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:34.980]
And don't forget, by the way.

[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.100]
Ad agency, people are assos.

[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.060]
1031 at 560, WQM.

[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.300]
I love those gun nuts, man.

[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.260]
Those are my favorite people.

[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:46.740]
The gun huggers, the gun squeezers, the guys with a real little tiny like weasel-like penises, you know, that have their phallic thing.

[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:53.880]
Yeah, there's definitely a direct correlation between the fact that we got a lot more people running around with concealed weapons and the fact that violent crime is done.

[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:55.660]
There's definitely a correlation there.

[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.260]
They showed us statistic on CNN a couple of days ago.

[00:22:58.580 --> 00:22:59.620]
I think the number was 55.

[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.980]
Look it up by the way, stupid.

[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.620]
55,000 and some people were killed with guns, handguns in this country last year.

[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.920]
And in the whole country in Japan, the whole year, I think the figure was two or three for the whole year.

[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.300]
And you want to know why?

[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.560]
Because nobody's walking around with handguns over in Japan.

[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.400]
Or in most other civilized countries either.

[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.780]
But it's a total waste of time because you'll never, ever break through this mentality.

[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.460]
It is ingrained like apple pie and...

[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.360]
That's the American fucker.

[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.380]
And God and hate.

[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.720]
It's like just as ingrained as any of those other things.

[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.300]
And Chevrolet, although I do like Corvette.

[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.440]
So there you go, sir.

[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.840]
You don't have to worry about a thing because you got all your buddies up there in the NRA.

[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:37.900]
They're paying everybody off.

[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.900]
And they can't pass anything that makes any sense.

[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.660]
So we got the new times out this week.

[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.020]
Their annual best of and more stuff and et cetera and so on.

[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.460]
Which is very talk about crime.

[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:47.820]
Wow.

[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.100]
Here's the best AM...

[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.320]
Well, let's start with the best FM.

[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.780]
Best FM radio personality.

[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.880]
New times, the pseudo intellectuals over there.

[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.040]
Pick a guy I never heard of.

[00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.300]
Albe Silk on EDR on Jamit 99.1.

[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.880]
And to go on and on about him.

[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.300]
Readers choice was Howard Stern.

[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.360]
But new times likes Albe Silk.

[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.860]
Best AM radio personality was...

[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.180]
Hey, stupid, Hank Goldberg.

[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.560]
See, we always like this though, like, you know.

[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.560]
Like, remember the year that they picked Phil Henry and the Readers picked me?

[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.820]
See, that's good because it gives the station a little bit of balance.

[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.060]
Even though some people claim I don't care about anybody else.

[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.120]
Which, of course, is a blatant f-ing lie.

[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.640]
But, you know, when people are getting fat,

[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.080]
they start to reacting badly and blaming everybody else.

[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:28.420]
I know.

[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.060]
Anyway, speaking of that, Hank Goldberg, it says his four-hour talk show,

[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.820]
Weekdays on WQM from 2 to 6 PM, is ostensibly a sports program.

[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.420]
But Goldberg's pugnacious punditry,

[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:38.500]
woo!

[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.280]
stretches far beyond the wide world of sports.

[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.460]
One recent Tuesday afternoon, for example,

[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.540]
the hammer managed to pound on the following topics.

[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.540]
Bego Co. Restaurant, I was the only one there who didn't have Blue Harry said.

[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.380]
Highly a racetrack.

[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.560]
What's that skinny disease?

[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.700]
Anorexia and anorexic wouldn't throw up there.

[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.180]
And the war between the mayors over the Mimie Circle,

[00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.060]
Penelope is getting on my nerves again,

[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.580]
if you can't see that he's grandstanding.

[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:04.260]
His relentless self-assurance, whether he's touting a 30-to-one long shot at Gulf Stream,

[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.420]
raiding against Mikkissuki Indian gaming,

[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.880]
or chatting amably with a Panther's defenseman.

[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.000]
I hate to break the news to you, but Denise Pong fans have never been a Panther's defenseman.

[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.820]
But nevertheless, makes his an undeniable voice of authority.

[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:20.060]
If you're looking for a truly independent passionate, old-school chronicler of Mimie sports

[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.560]
and life, forget the Harold, trust the hammer.

[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.160]
That was funny.

[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.660]
Reader's choice, Neil Rogers.

[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:29.460]
So there you go. That's nice.

[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.220]
QAM, we went out all the way along there.

[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.120]
Greg Reed was happy. He was trying to pedal his way.

[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.180]
Get out of here. Greg, we already got our own copy.

[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.600]
Okay, and he just turned around and ran out.

[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.840]
By the way, did Duff come in here and sit down and discuss with me

[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.780]
that the situation about the effect of...

[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:41.780]

[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.160]
...okay. That was the best part.

[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.040]
That was my favorite part.

[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.840]
Duff Lindsay should come and have a conversation with me

[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.400]
about my professionalism and whether or not I passed along the facts,

[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.820]
that I read to the man right on the ear here yesterday.

[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.220]
I read it to him.

[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.720]
Did he come running in here like any time at all

[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.240]
or did he come waddling in here anything?

[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:01.700]
Say, hey, you got that facts?

[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.520]
Did he do that? No.

[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:04.820]
No.

[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.560]
But what he does is go on here the next morning,

[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.700]
belly-ickened about the fact that somehow it never reached him.

[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.860]
Like I'm supposed to stick it in his box and the facts too, you know?

[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.540]
And then see, I told you, once we saw those mailboxes up there,

[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.020]
do we have a mailbox? No.

[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:20.240]
No.

[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.120]
But now that the sports nerds are got a mailbox,

[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.200]
NAAAH, you see.

[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.440]
So he just used that as an excuse to lure it over the fact

[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.060]
they got a mailbox and we don't.

[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.960]
But guess what? Do we care? No.

[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:30.220]
No.

[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.480]
That's right. See, I picked the greatest day in the history of my life

[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.160]
to take that whole attitude, which is...

[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.320]
I don't give a sh** anymore.

[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.500]
Yeah! That's my new attitude now.

[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.260]
Starting yesterday and I feel a lot better as a result of it.

[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.080]
I've got my CD burner.

[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.840]
Life is great. Life is sweet.

[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.440]
Which I think is his line.

[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.780]
So anyway, in this disgusting best of...

[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.420]
And keep in mind that these are the pseudo-intellectuals over there, okay?

[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.760]
New Times Magazine, the self-proplanned pseudo-intellectuals.

[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.360]
So you think that they would be outraged at things like this.

[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.560]
But never. Here's the best radio station.

[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.320]
Here's their choice.

[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.600]
I mean, this is so anxious, so unacceptable.

[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:08.920]
But you know what it reminds me of?

[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.200]
What do I do with that letter of the editor?

[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.560]
I probably buried that thing by now.

[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:13.580]
Long. Oh, here it is.

[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.920]
Newspapers, prejudice against Christians says,

[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.560]
carols are relic in western.

[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.200]
I was appalled that you would print the cartoon on April 26th,

[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.600]
depicting Christians as the enemy of the students or anyone else.

[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.840]
Since prayer was taken out of the classroom,

[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.940]
as violence is entered with many deaths and injuries.

[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.600]
We Christians don't hurt people of different views.

[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:35.680]
We pray for them.

[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.820]
And that's what they said in the Inquisition, too, I guess.

[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.020]
Following every disaster, the President or an official says,

[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.400]
let us pray for the victims.

[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.560]
Why is the Sun coming?

[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.700]
We are not sent and they are also prejudiced.

[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.380]
We Christians are constantly persecuted by the media.

[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:48.720]
Yeah.

[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.940]
They just pretend they don't get it, you know?

[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.880]
Like this is a Christian country, isn't it?

[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:55.260]
No.

[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:55.860]
Right.

[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.660]
Doesn't everybody else have a right to a different point of no?

[00:27:59.380 --> 00:27:59.380]

[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.140]
So the same thing with this particular issue,

[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:08.460]
best radio station, New Times Magazine, selects 97.7 FN Unlicensed.

[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.240]
Now this is just above the Ecolomore.

[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.940]
They picked the best drug dealers in town.

[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.640]
Isn't that one going to be next?

[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.280]
Yeah, I'm on.

[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.000]
Must be.

[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.780]
This will be like saying, the best arsonist,

[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.540]
the best murderer, well we know who that is,

[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.320]
I'll get to that in a minute.

[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.620]
I'll wait till you hear this story about,

[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.940]
about, you guys better strap yourselves in today, okay?

[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.620]
And don't lip off to us.

[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:40.620]
Best radio station, 97.7 FN Unlicensed.

[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.300]
See, when they're in the newspaper business,

[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.960]
no have to get license from the federal government

[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.660]
and spend millions and millions of dollars to get it,

[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.420]
and equipment and all this other stuff.

[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.880]
But I guess you can, you know,

[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.300]
have this kind of La Zé Fair attitude

[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.900]
about the broadcasting industry.

[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.620]
It says, this is the real and ill-contemporary format.

[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.060]
DJs play everything from Motown to Hip Hop,

[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.180]
with no annoying commercials.

[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.480]
Ads are rare on 97.7,

[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.520]
though every once in a while an MC will pull your gig

[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.660]
of his own or one of his buddies.

[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.940]
But every business has bills to pay, right?

[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.140]
Like this is a legitimate business they're talking about.

[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.200]
This station is also interactive and community oriented.

[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.080]
Especially in using other rides,

[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.300]
with a lively music bit,

[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.460]
an EGA will ask you to call our rapid-fire questions

[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.980]
in a callable respond example.

[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.140]
Would you give me money? Yes, I will. Yes, I will.

[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.000]
How much would you give me $20? $20?

[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.680]
During high school football season,

[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.600]
colors bring their team pride of the year for all to hear.

[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.980]
We're not sure who's running the show after the FCC rated

[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.920]
the Liberty City Studios in July 1998

[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.300]
and carried away their 2,000 watt transmitters.

[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.720]
But good ideas are like mushrooms that pop up overnight.

[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.980]
And within a few weeks of the raid,

[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.600]
the station was out again on the year.

[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.440]
When we got tired of the golden oldies

[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.400]
and modeling slow dance tune segments,

[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.680]
we surf over to 89.1 on license

[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.780]
for a more raw and less eclectic hip-hop format

[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.000]
but to signals a little weak.

[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.560]
So they like over at New Times,

[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.460]
they like illegal is what they like.

[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.380]
That's what they like the best.

[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.880]
When they get tired of some of the stuff on this illegal station,

[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.200]
then they turn it over to another one.

[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.820]
Nice! Nice message that you're sending out there

[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.100]
over there at New Times, you assholes.

[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.080]
You morons.

[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.260]
And you know something,

[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:09.820]
I don't doubt that they're playing better music.

[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.140]
I'm playing better music on my CDs now

[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.140]
than I got my CD burner.

[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.280]
But what the hell's that got to do with it?

[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.460]
Jesus Christ, I mean,

[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.220]
we're talking crazy people over there.

[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.480]
And we get so much of this from the audience too.

[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.160]
Oh yeah, those pirate stations are great.

[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.560]
They're breaking the effing law.

[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.140]
That's some little tiny like J-walking law.

[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.800]
They're cluttering up the airwaves

[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.380]
that people have invested millions and billions of dollars

[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.420]
to put legitimate commercial stations on the air

[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.980]
that are trying to make a living with crap,

[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.600]
with whatever they want to put on there.

[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:41.340]
And by the way,

[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.300]
they're also using every goddamn word that's ever invented,

[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.080]
which if we use it, we're going to go to jail.

[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.600]
You can't, I don't even have time between now

[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.860]
and two o'clock to mention all the goddamn laws that they're breaking.

[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.800]
Oh well, yeah, but we like it.

[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:53.120]
Great!

[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.780]
Go to work for New Times, they like it too.

[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:56.720]
Bunch of assholes.

[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.060]
Always voted that we're assholes.

[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.440]
Thank God for a city link, man.

[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.680]
Thank God for them.

[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.680]
They suck me, I suck them.

[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.440]
Well, that's the way life works.

[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.820]
I don't want to start getting too excited

[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.180]
because then you think I care and I don't.

[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:12.500]
I don't care anymore.

[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.320]
That's my new attitude.

[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.120]
I feel great about it too, just like that facts.

[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.400]
Okay, D-Fo, I don't care.

[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.580]
If you feel bad about it, it's too bad.

[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:20.860]
In fact, why doesn't he demand the $500?

[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.500]
He's not going to miss out on that thing.

[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.700]
He'll be there with Bells on.

[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.000]
Like he doesn't know Marino and Shula

[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.560]
and all the other people that are on that list.

[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.460]
Every single one of them was one of his sports nerd buddies.

[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.720]
So what's the problem?

[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:33.580]
Call one of them up.

[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.840]
They'll give you the inside scoop.

[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.840]
But he's got to make a big issue out of it.

[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.560]
Like I'm some kind of an asshole in son of a bitch

[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.680]
just because they said he's getting fat

[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.520]
and you are getting fat.

[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:42.800]
Okay?

[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.480]
We're trying to help you and you don't want to be helped.

[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.640]
Always these people are in denial, you know?

[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.320]
Like Fat Boy, we'll get in the him in a minute.

[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.460]
24-11 at 560 WQM.

[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.360]
Don't miss out on the bloody cloud.

[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:57.360]
Yes.

[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.260]
Are you?

[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.660]
I wear two fold shoes to stay and something's on this right.

[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:13.100]
I took a walk on down the street and I took out my flashlight.

[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:19.080]
And I suspected something funny when I saw Father Flores.

[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:24.340]
Then I jumped over the wall and then I'd done Hato's Dough.

[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.360]
Don't me about something to hurt so I looked around some more.

[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:35.560]
And I suspected something funny when I found a bloody cloud.

[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.240]
A bloody cloud.

[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.500]
Oh, I thought it had to tell Kato a bloody cloud.

[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:44.740]
Roy.

[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.420]
Oh, whoa, whoa.

[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:52.080]
That thing we knew, okay, went on a losby from all right.

[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:57.760]
Now he's in an L.A. J. Jones for double on the site.

[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.240]
And I believe it's first degree.

[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:10.440]
Murder, he's guilty of it's because I'm a bloody cloud.

[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.340]
Oh, right.

[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.760]
This is an astonishing third.

[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.560]
Let me preface this third by the way.

[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.100]
I was telling you a little incident that happened when I left here yesterday, okay?

[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:21.960]
I kept there's a tie in coming.

[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.380]
So as I leave yesterday, we have some inside parking down here,

[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.180]
which of course being a big shot like I am, I have one of those special,

[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.780]
whatever they call those, those card keys, those clickers, whatever the LAR.

[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.520]
So I can get on the inside, even though it's like a wide open down there.

[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:37.320]
But nevertheless, so I parked on there.

[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:41.340]
And usually a 90% of the time if the spot is open, I wind up because of the time that I get here.

[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:45.040]
The one spot that's available that's covered happens to be the one on the very end there.

[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.660]
And a very tough spot to back out of.

[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.460]
But nevertheless, I do it just about every day.

[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.620]
So yesterday I'm going out to my car and here's the water Nazi.

[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:52.320]
Tell us.

[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:56.980]
And our program director, PG, our PG, Pussy, Galora, sitting out there on the bench,

[00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:59.400]
chatting about whatever.

[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.300]
And I had like a couple of words to the program director on the way.

[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.740]
I cried the course not there because we don't speak.

[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.940]
And so I get in my car and I'm backing out, okay?

[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:11.740]
Now backing from that spot, as you know, is not the easiest thing in the world.

[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.360]
They have to back straight up and then make a little bit of an angle.

[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.560]
And then you know, make your right turn, go forward a little bit.

[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.140]
If there's another car park there, which they're always is on, just about.

[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.780]
And it was yesterday and then back up again and zip out of there.

[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.420]
I mean, it's not the end of the world, but it's not an easy thing.

[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.800]
And usually if anybody is standing back there or they're sitting on the bench,

[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.160]
they got enough common sense that when you're backing out of there,

[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.760]
that when anybody is backing out, you get up and get that out of the way.

[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.260]
And you know, you let them go as far back as possible because it's a tough squeeze.

[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:39.660]
So do they get up and get out of the way?

[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:39.980]
No.

[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:41.860]
They're sitting there.

[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.880]
You know, and so I'm watching in a review mirror and now Duff is giving me like

[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.160]
directions, okay?

[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:48.800]
He's showing me with a hand.

[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.980]
You know, come on back, come on back.

[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.900]
And I'm not watching her.

[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.360]
I'm watching him with a hand.

[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.300]
And so I'm backing up and they're turning a little bit, you know.

[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.020]
And all of a sudden, and here, ah!

[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.960]
And I rolled on a window and here's the water now.

[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.500]
See, she's, I know you hate me, but are you trying to kill me?

[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.340]
I said, hey, I'm just watching him.

[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.200]
He's giving me the directions and the hand signals.

[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.360]
And then of course, he turned on him and rightfully so.

[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.300]
So it was Blot that was trying to kill you, Phil, it's not me.

[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.880]
Now was I trying to hit her?

[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:21.420]
No.

[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.120]
But, well, just leave it in her mind.

[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.040]
That's something to think about.

[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:28.560]
Now I don't want to say who had a great line for this, by the way.

[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:31.720]
I don't want to mention who came up with this line.

[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:36.960]
She's already got that handicap sticker on her van.

[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.780]
But anyway, I don't want to say that.

[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:39.200]
That's bad.

[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.200]
So then when I backed up the second time,

[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:42.600]
ah!

[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:43.340]
Stop!

[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.380]
And of course, that time it was on purpose.

[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.060]
I knew I wasn't going to hit her, but I just put the fear of God in her.

[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:49.560]
So anyway, moving along from that,

[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.900]
I told you all the stories about the water not so you know how she loves to boss everybody around.

[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.200]
She's got her own little empire back there and she's been here a hundred years and got naked pictures.

[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.140]
And she's got her own little park and spot down there.

[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.520]
And none of us even think about the park in there.

[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.780]
So at any rate, come to find out that last night,

[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.120]
our sales face person, not a sales hole but our sales face guy.

[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:10.800]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.220]
I've never told him the countenance life, but he's the face man.

[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:18.020]
Remember that memo I read that day about when they have trouble closing an account they send up there with a sales hole.

[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.980]
Yeah, and he smooths his ex-dolphin and that's good.

[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:22.060]
He's a good guy, like Roy.

[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:22.600]
Roy!

[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:27.040]
But, but, like everybody else, all the rest of us, he's not perfect.

[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:32.780]
And one of the flaws he has is, well, do I dare say the initials?

[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.940]
Do we know where they went to there, by the way?

[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:36.700]
Oh, man.

[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.640]
Do we have any idea?

[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.320]
In the Grove, but we can find out the exact spot.

[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.980]
Somewhere in the Grove, we'll find out the exact spot.

[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.300]
Too bad we couldn't have found out ahead of time, you know?

[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.140]
We'd have promoted.

[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.660]
Because I know where, you know, those old-fashioned pull chains they have in the toilet.

[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.180]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.160]
Because Roy had dinner with the...

[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:54.720]
Oh, man.

[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.320]
OJ last night in the Grove.

[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:03.200]
And we have a whole core of little OJ lookers in this radio station.

[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.440]
Now, see, I happen to be one of those people.

[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:10.220]
You know, that thing with James Carville and Mary Maddal and her Magdalena, whatever her name is.

[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.980]
That's got to be one of the most bizarre marriages in history.

[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:17.960]
She's a real right-wing bitch and he's a real liberal, whatever hell he has balled at a geek.

[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.120]
And they're married.

[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:20.260]
You know?

[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.660]
They're probably screaming in the olive oil they're doing it.

[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.300]
You know, they're yelling, commie fascist, whatever.

[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.180]
So I'm just not one of those people that be friends.

[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.180]
I just can't do it.

[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.680]
I don't be friend right-wing lunatics.

[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:35.180]
It's just not in my best interest.

[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:35.940]
I can't do that.

[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.360]
I can't just can't set aside those kinds of things.

[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:46.400]
And the same would be if I knew somebody that turned out to be an ax murderer that would have murdered two people in cold blood and everybody knew about it,

[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:48.740]
I don't think I could continue to be that person's friend.

[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:53.820]
Now, maybe call me disloyal, call me hypocritical, whatever was this morning I was being called.

[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:54.860]
Fine, I don't care.

[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.400]
Because like I said, I don't give a crap anymore.

[00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:57.840]
Call me whatever you want.

[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:05.520]
And so the fact that we have a core of OJ liquors in this building disturbs me greatly.

[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:08.560]
One of them, I don't want to mention her name, but almost got the cripple yesterday.

[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:15.040]
Has got all kinds of pictures of this creep, of this murdering piece of turd in her office all over the walls.

[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:19.500]
And our sales manager, screw in and her good friend Roy.

[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.680]
Also happen to be big OJ liquors.

[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.480]
There's a little fraternity, those three.

[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:30.240]
But then to find out that when somebody in the building discovered that Roy was going to have dinner with OJ last night,

[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.820]
so I dare mention that it was Sam the Sham who hasn't shown his face in here yet.

[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.820]
He's probably going to go into hiding for days now.

[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:38.360]
What?

[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:41.220]
No, he has no Sham.

[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:42.580]
No, you're right about that.

[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:43.600]
He has no Sham.

[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:48.040]
Of course, anybody that looks like the dead Andrew Kunein and why should he have any Sham?

[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.520]
He's probably on the houseboat right now.

[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:56.660]
He's got an old copy of Sports Illustrated that's got OJ on the cover.

[00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.120]
And he slips it to Roy and he says,

[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:02.140]
you think you can get him to autograph this for me?

[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:05.220]
Huh?

[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:06.980]
He slips it to Roy.

[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.080]
He slips it to Roy.

[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.800]
And then Roy slips it to, oh well.

[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.560]
Oh, that was before?

[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:12.720]
Yeah.

[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.880]
Oh, many times.

[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.060]
We don't want to get into that.

[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.140]
Yeah, that's his business.

[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.000]
That's between them.

[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.420]
I mean, not figured it out literally.

[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.200]
It's between them.

[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.020]
Boy, there's a lot of crack goes on in this place, man.

[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:26.720]
I mean, you know what?

[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.160]
Like I said yesterday, I find out I've got a whole different answer.

[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.140]
I find it most amusing.

[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.580]
Not going to get upset about it.

[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.320]
Although I do get upset about the fact that we got assholes that lick OJ's butt.

[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.040]
That's what I draw the line, you know?

[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.200]
I can't stand that.

[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.820]
And now that I find out that we got to see,

[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:46.380]
and the thing with Sam, that doesn't surprise me because a lot of the guys we got around here are groupies.

[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.120]
The sports nerd people, they're groupies.

[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.220]
Oh, can I get your autograph?

[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.440]
You know, that kind of crap.

[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:53.020]
Jock Snippers.

[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:58.560]
But the notion that somebody wants that murdering piece of crap's autograph.

[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.660]
See, you don't have time to get my name spelled right in the Marlon program,

[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.120]
or do any of those other things.

[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.280]
Or they have like a meaningful promotion for the radio station.

[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.840]
He doesn't have time because he's too busy, you know, seeking glory.

[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:13.880]
Holes or whatever he's doing.

[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.060]
Getting autographs from Game of Celebrities.

[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.560]
Guys who want to wear a Jock strap.

[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.160]
You know, all of this other silly garbage.

[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:21.020]
Morons.

[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:22.960]
Like OJ.

[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:23.560]
Oh, man.

[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:25.460]
Maybe I'm wrong.

[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.140]
Anybody out there would go to dinner with OJ?

[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.940]
I bet you're, I bet you're, I know who would go to dinner with OJ.

[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.980]
If OJ bought, I don't want to mention no names.

[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:34.640]
They stuck.

[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:35.540]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.300]
He would go to dinner with OJ if OJ promised to buy.

[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:44.560]
In fact, you know, I'd be real interested because OJ is falling on hard financial times.

[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:49.120]
I'd be real fascinated to find out who bought that dinner last night between Roy and OJ.

[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:51.520]
Wouldn't that be interesting?

[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:59.220]
Because if OJ's got money to be buying Roy dinner, then he ought to be paying, you know, the goldmins.

[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.040]
Maybe they're still sitting there waiting to see who's going to pick up the check.

[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:02.860]
That could be it.

[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:05.760]
Well, maybe Rimmer will show up one of these days.

[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.480]
Maybe I'll just wander in by accident.

[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:08.880]
Oh, yeah, can I grab that?

[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.260]
Hold your breath, guys.

[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.860]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.020]
I got a whole Todd Dreck thing I got new here yet today.

[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:19.240]
Oh, yeah.

[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.360]
Major, major piece I got to do on that.

[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.020]
I don't want to lip off about it too much, but...

[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:31.040]
You know, in the past, I can only think, all the years I've been on the air, I can only think of a couple of times

[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.440]
that I've ever gone to the extraordinary lengths of getting involved.

[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:35.860]
One was with a satellite guy.

[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.300]
Remember that?

[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.520]
With a satellite dish?

[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:42.580]
And then there was one guy who insisted on advertising and I said no for years and I never did.

[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.680]
But there was another guy who got on the air and they turned out to be a real pain in the ass.

[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.240]
And we finally just blew him off and it was a nightmare.

[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:56.080]
And this thing that I got here with my friends at Culligan Water, who love the radio station, they love me.

[00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:57.120]
I love them.

[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:04.260]
They, you know, we got a bottled water thing here that all the people up here on the third floor, they love the water, they love the Culligan people, they love the Culligan man.

[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.860]
I got that water softener they put in my house again.

[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.600]
A nice silky shower this morning.

[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:12.460]
My skin feels like I'm 100 years younger and great drinking water.

[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:15.740]
They're ecstatic to be on the air with me and I'm ecstatic to have them.

[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.560]
They're wonderful people.

[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.600]
Chris and a whole bunch of glimpses over there. They're great.

[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:23.000]
But we got Todd Dreck and we got these agency people.

[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.440]
I don't want to mention Mark Lipoff because then Todd will go off again.

[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.200]
You know, I want to lip off about that.

[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.660]
I will just say, hey agency people are assholes.

[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.760]
And I just foresee a disaster coming here.

[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:37.080]
You know, I just see something really which is unfortunate because they're very happy to be on the air with me.

[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.200]
I'm ecstatic to be with them.

[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.020]
They give me great service of the house.

[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.120]
They give us great service up here at the radio station.

[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.440]
It's a match made in heaven.

[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.300]
Only sales holes could screw up into you like this.

[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.460]
That's how solid it is.

[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.420]
That's how great things are between me and the Culligan people.

[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.980]
But leave it to our Todd Dreck in here and his guy, agency guy.

[00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.700]
Who's a Shmab? Who's a Shmendrick?

[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.320]
And I just don't know what to do about it now because of course we have nobody involved in these things here.

[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:06.080]
Is Ray Perry involved?

[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:06.380]
No.

[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:09.760]
Do we even know if Ray Perry exists anymore?

[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:10.100]
No.

[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.260]
Are new sales managers?

[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:11.640]
No.

[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.060]
Did we were going to see every Tuesday morning he was going to come by.

[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.180]
These were the kind of things we were going to discuss with him.

[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:18.160]
Do we see him at all?

[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:18.440]
No.

[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:22.860]
Have we seen him ever since so we came up on the third floor except that he brought my Marlon tickets in?

[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:23.180]
No.

[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:23.360]
No.

[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.260]
See, in this case I do care.

[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.140]
Or, narrowly, I wouldn't care anymore.

[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.260]
But in this case I do care because they're nice people and they got a great company.

[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:34.660]
It's a natural.

[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.680]
It's a great fit.

[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:41.460]
But unfortunately I'm getting fits because we got ad agency people involved and a local sales guy here.

[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.200]
It's running around the hall creating problems with everybody in the building.

[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:44.940]
Even the janitor.

[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.080]
You know, the janitor he's melting off to about this stuff.

[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.200]
That's what Jeff Hyte told me.

[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:55.200]
Kent.

[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:59.660]
Hey listen, like I said, I don't care anymore.

[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.740]
Oh God, what a place.

[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:04.840]
And like I said, it's great.

[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.400]
It's the best place George and I have ever worked.

[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:08.540]
Because nobody cares.

[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.220]
Four minutes before 11 to find.

[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.540]
By the way, speaking nobody cares.

[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:16.180]
Wait till you find out who's hangs up there at the pre-knist in Baltimore getting ready for this weekend.

[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:21.940]
And on the ISDN phone line from Philadelphia where he has his full time job.

[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.340]
Bill Zenfur fills in for Hank this afternoon, which is embarrassing.

[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:27.300]
And then we got the mad dog.

[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.720]
Jim Mandice six o'clock seven thirty.

[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.920]
We got the Colorado Detroit hockey game.

[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.280]
You're selling your home looking to buy one.

[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.660]
Let me tell you about buy owner.

[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.440]
You can play here.

[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:37.780]
My family.

[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:38.860]
My daughter.

[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.040]
Oh right.

[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.100]
My anus.

[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.520]
My anus.

[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:44.960]
My anus.

[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:45.640]
My anus.

[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:45.640]

[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:47.820]
My anus.

[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.240]
My anus.

[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:50.680]
My anus.

[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:51.040]
My anus.

[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:51.380]
My anus.

[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:51.380]

[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.480]
My anus.

[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.000]
My anus.

[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000]
My anus.

[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:00.760]
My anus.

[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:01.440]
My anus.

[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.180]
My anus.

[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:02.200]

[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:02.800]
My anus.

[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:03.760]
My anus.

[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:04.420]
Hi kids.

[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.280]
Y'all like cutting little stinkers?

[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.920]
That funny little sound that comes right out your stinker?

[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:12.200]
One of coffee me and do exactly like I do.

[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.880]
Get paid for writing little songs about boo-boo.

[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.560]
My brains are gone.

[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:18.120]
I'm trying to get my groove on.

[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.760]
But I can't figure out which spice girl I'm gonna fart on.

[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.700]
And Dr. Dre asked, you know, man, you pissed us.

[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:24.600]
Hey, I know.

[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.020]
What do I smell like?

[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.000]
It's game you low-play.

[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:31.280]
Well, since age 12 it seemed like I always smell like fast-ripping gases and dooties

[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.080]
was pretty swell.

[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:37.360]
I got pissed off when I took my jeans off and farted so hard that my lungs were backwards

[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.740]
like crisscrossed.

[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:43.700]
And every night I'm like, oh, thinner than one of my ass fasses of fat bitch who ain't too

[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:43.980]
fat.

[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.200]
Smell this honey.

[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:46.960]
You know, it's too late to miss a girl, huh?

[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.840]
I don't give a f***ing god-send me to stink the world up.

[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:51.280]
My anus.

[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:52.800]
My anus.

[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:54.200]
My anus.

[00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:57.220]
My anus.

[00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:58.580]
My anus.

[00:45:59.220 --> 00:45:59.980]
My anus.

[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:00.820]
My anus.

[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:01.180]
My anus.

[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:01.320]
My anus.

[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:01.320]

[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.220]
I could see you want to me kick out back in junior high.

[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:07.120]
Said the problem was something proled up my ass and die.

[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.160]
I shot him in the face with my vapour.

[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:12.840]
The worst happened later when I covered his death with used toilet paper.

[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.240]
Walked in the strip club.

[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.640]
My testers were filled up.

[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.420]
Moons of Bob Tannin took a dump and a kicker.

[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.400]
Went over to a dentist and had a f***ing agonist.

[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.560]
She lifted a leg up and I knew she was a fodder.

[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.660]
Nine and nine.

[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.460]
And sent him my life by with life too.

[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.360]
I just found out my mom got all gassed and I knew.

[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.100]
I told her I broke up to be a famous rapper.

[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:34.940]
They regretted about strange noises.

[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:35.980]
Made on the crap.

[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.980]
You know you was dirt when the women rushed to leave.

[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.160]
You drive her over back, but she wasn't needed to relieve her.

[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.880]
The sky of white castle said it was pretty cool.

[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:45.900]
But I had to go.

[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.900]
No drop the kids off and move.

[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.820]
My aim is.

[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.540]
My aim is.

[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:54.680]
My aim is.

[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.460]
My aim is.

[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:58.960]
My aim is.

[00:46:59.000 --> 00:46:59.400]
S***.

[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:01.420]
My aim is.

[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:02.840]
My aim is.

[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:02.940]

[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:03.080]

[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:03.080]

[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.240]
My aim is.

[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:04.600]

[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:04.600]

[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:05.040]
My aim is.

[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:05.100]
My aim is.

[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:05.200]
My aim is.

[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:05.200]

[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:05.780]
S***.

[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:09.900]
Okay, so what's that smushed in, Mark?

[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:10.680]
Look off, he's in.

[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.020]
Four minutes after 11.

[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.200]
His file will get him in a minute.

[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:17.420]
Four minutes passed the hour at 50WQA and we got to build Zimper Show coming a lot.

[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:21.040]
for Hank at two. Can you believe that Bill's infertile?

[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:24.200]
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:29.340]
Anyway, this is interesting. Here's a, I wish we had the Wamiya for just 30 seconds again,

[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:34.380]
so I could show these two facts. I don't even know how to describe this.

[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.960]
It's the same facts word for word, which I was going to get to, by the way, my

[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:42.400]
impatient listener out there. The first one is signed Barney, and the second one

[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:46.720]
is for Sa- he says, OI! Barney at the end of the first one, and then the second one,

[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:50.000]
in different type, in different font, it says, OI!

[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:54.280]
An atheist. Well, maybe he's progressing now, because we found out yesterday that the atheist

[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:59.960]
closet floor, that door is locked tight. Tight is a drum. I mean, I read that letter

[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:03.600]
from Holly Doherty, which I've saved. Religion is not the issue that great letter to the

[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.740]
editor in a herald yesterday, and the amount of response we got on it, we could have stuck

[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:11.920]
in your room for the Soviet Army left over in there. I mean, no response at all, which

[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:15.780]
I'm going to take a poll about that in a little while, by the way, because I think that George and I

[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:19.540]
have been whistling in a fart storm for a long time. But, you know, I'm not going to stop.

[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:24.440]
I'm not going to stop talking about those things just because of the majority of you are just too

[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:28.020]
bone-headed to understand them, or just too terrified of death, too much of bunch of

[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:33.140]
pussies. Anyway, it says, the weekly magazine edition of the Washington Post is that according

[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:38.560]
to a national survey, many Americans already say they'll be talking to God when the year

[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:43.980]
2000 dawns. Maybe they mean, the survey found 36% of those individuals say they'll be

[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:48.980]
praying more than usual to usher in the new millennium. 27% say they'll seek spiritual

[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:54.860]
guidance, and 25% claim they'll go to church more often on our after December 31, 1990

[00:48:54.860 --> 00:49:00.420]
young. The survey also showed that generation X late 20s, early 30s are significantly more

[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:04.700]
likely than elderly people to believe the new millennium is significant from a religious standpoint.

[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:10.360]
Oy! 34% of generation Xers believe this compared to the late 22% of people over 60.

[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:15.420]
Not surprisingly, southerners are more likely than people living elsewhere in the US to discuss

[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:21.320]
the new millennium at church. Yeah. And is Barney, the atheist or whoever he really

[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:25.600]
is, says it should be out! percent in all categories, obviously. I mean we're changing the

[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:30.680]
date on a calendar. OG, I tear this up, somebody might need this. We're changing the

[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:34.600]
date on a calendar. And as George pointed out, which I've never read you thought about

[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:39.420]
before, until year 2001, we're not in the next millennium anyway, still a 20th century.

[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:44.600]
I want you to stop and think about something, okay? When you talk about, when you count in

[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:49.220]
tens or in hundreds, okay? You don't count the number zero, do you? No!

[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:55.700]
No! You started one. So counting in numbers, whether it's years, whether it's

[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.700]
eggs, whether it's roses, whatever it is, it starts with one, it ends with ten.

[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:06.360]
The next ten starts with eleven. Are you following? I mean I know I'm, this is terrible

[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.680]
and don't blame me, blame George. He's the one who pointed this out to me a couple of weeks ago. I never

[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:14.020]
gave it much thought. There was no year zero. There was no year zero. The 21st century

[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:19.420]
doesn't start till year 2001. That'll be the first year of the 21st century. Does anybody

[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:24.700]
talk about that? No! Because there's a lot of this other height going on. And has to do

[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:28.780]
with all these computer chips, you know, for the year 1900 is both a 2000, that's a

[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:36.120]
computer thing. It has nothing to do with what century it is. Oh boy! I hate to break the

[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:39.700]
news to all those Y2K people, but their big movies coming out this summer and it's not

[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:43.060]
going to phase anybody anyway. Because that's always what the American people say. Don't

[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:48.400]
confuse us with the fact, mister, okay? That's the American f**king way. That's right. The 21st

[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:54.280]
century don't start till the year 2001. That's the first year of the 21st century. Just

[00:50:54.280 --> 00:51:05.840]
like ten is the last number of the first group of ten. It's not zero through nine. So how

[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.260]
am I saying? Do they understand what I'm talking about? No! First not! Because I'm peeing on

[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:14.680]
there for OG or confusing us with the facts again. We hate you for that. Yeah, I know. Like

[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:24.000]
all that God bullcrap. And like dying. Oh no! Don't get too deep present. Boy! Okay, like I've

[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.700]
always said, what you see is most definitely not what you get. If you don't believe me to stop and

[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:33.080]
think about Ricky Martin for 20 seconds. It's far enough away from lunch. What you see is definitely

[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:39.400]
not what you get. Whether you're looking on top on the surface or on the bottom. Eight minutes

[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:50.680]
after 11 at 560 WQA. If he needs money, we're 80. All for men. Oh!

[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:51.620]
Charlie.

[00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:57.440]
A big star and a giant, all three just show and swap.

[00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:58.040]
Yes.

[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:04.840]
A big blue and a big star, all three just show and swap.

[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:05.400]
Very great.

[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:20.680]
A big blue and a big star, all three just show and swap.
