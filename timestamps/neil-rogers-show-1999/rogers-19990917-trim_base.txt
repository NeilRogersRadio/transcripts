[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:07.980]
Sport Radio 560, LWQAM, Miami Fort Lauderdale, presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.640]
You dropped a Neil called 560-750-560 toll free, per day to Bradford, more pound 560 on

[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.340]
your cell phone.

[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.120]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers, or anyone else on the show do not necessarily

[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.640]
reflect those of WGQAM, deeply read acquisitions or the fees of Rochester.

[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.100]
For the menow, Neil Rogers on the Sport Radio 560-2AM.

[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.540]
Well, I do.

[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.980]
You fast, dude.

[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.480]
How are you doing today?

[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.080]
Fine.

[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.460]
I wanted to take over a little segment here of Phil Schell if I could, because we were,

[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.580]
and I mentioned this to you when I called you originally, first of all, Henry Barrel

[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.260]
sends us regards, not that I've talked to Henry since.

[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.040]
I'm Ann Henry.

[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.960]
Henry sends us regards, Cheryl sends her regards to you.

[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.560]
That's great, Cheryl's the work on that.

[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.260]
Yes, she is.

[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.580]
My God, you'll be, you'll get an associate security there.

[00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.580]
I'm not going to tell her that.

[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.160]
Okay.

[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.240]
I'm not going to tell her that.

[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.620]
God.

[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.980]
We, frankly, Larry, were a little bit, Jacob the back, I guess, is the best way to put it,

[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.340]
by comments you made to Coach Shula on your program.

[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.040]
My understanding was it was Friday evening.

[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.580]
Well, I was taken back when I had two different friends call me.

[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.200]
On, I think there was one call Thursday night, one call Friday, when it was learned that Donald was going to retire.

[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.280]
And they both said, if you heard your already a station, I said, no, I worked there 20 years with the organization,

[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.360]
never to do the dolphins.

[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.520]
They said, they're creaming and the deaths.

[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.640]
So, to me, I was there at the study school, maniacs are calling in and saying personal things about them.

[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.980]
They're vilifying them and there's a guy in the morning looking at them, not the most,

[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.260]
he should be out of coaching and he's too old and a lot of guy criticizing the way he looks.

[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.760]
So, when I heard that, two different people, what I said to Don was, I heard that the station I worked at,

[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.840]
and you worked at, because Don and I did a show together every day on WIO Day 3rd.

[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.440]
So, it was rapid, you and he said, he had, all he said, well, I'm just finishing.

[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.420]
Then he said he hadn't listened to talk radio in two years, but that he heard about.

[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.620]
Well, so if I'm wrong, tell me well.

[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.180]
Well, first of all, we were not personally attacking Coach Hula.

[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.140]
We certainly, we do a talk show here as you do. We have several.

[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.640]
What we did do and any talk show would do, certainly relative to a story of this kind of local import,

[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.320]
was invite our listeners to call and voice their opinions.

[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.420]
The host had no personal opinions about the show.

[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.200]
So, Neil Rogers, quite frankly, if you speak of Neil Rogers or Rick and Suds are in the shows here,

[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.380]
had met them, but the most blowing things to say about Coach Hula in his retirement.

[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.860]
Now, why?

[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.060]
Neil Rogers has something glowing to say about someone.

[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.860]
Neil was on, the day the retirement was announced.

[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.980]
Neil said, I'm talking about before the retirement.

[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.880]
I'm talking about after the retirement, the whole city of Florida.

[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.940]
I can assure you this.

[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.380]
What about before the retirement?

[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.300]
I can assure you this.

[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.140]
There was nothing personal in any negative state that made by Neil Rogers.

[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.160]
What kind of criticisms were that?

[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.680]
That he was that he had his coaching ability had begun to slump that the game perhaps was passing and buy,

[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.680]
that it was time to make room for a coach.

[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.080]
And as you know, the popularity of Jimmy Johnson here is well.

[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.640]
I wrote in my column three years ago that Jimmy was kind of coming coach Miami and Jimmy told me that and that was.

[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.940]
He'll fasten just as high too.

[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.560]
Let me say this.

[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.240]
There's a way you can do it in a way you cannot do it.

[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.120]
Now, you can encourage callers to vilify.

[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.720]
I've been doing this a long time.

[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.780]
I am staring at it.

[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.240]
I started.

[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.180]
I know that you were with our radio station.

[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.840]
What are you?

[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.900]
And so I'm out of do talk show.

[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.660]
Crazy puppets.

[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.080]
And I know how you can storm up a crowd.

[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.580]
And the people who told me I have faith in.

[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.680]
So you'll tell me that Neil Rogers praised him.

[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.440]
I was shocked.

[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.520]
I wouldn't even bother you.

[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.820]
I wouldn't even bother you with a phone call where I can't.

[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.320]
I don't know.

[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.640]
I'm going to ask after a time that everybody's asking for a man.

[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.360]
That's below.

[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.820]
I'm talking about before coach Shula.

[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.620]
A number of years callers personal or insightful.

[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.240]
The callers, some of the callers may have been some.

[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.860]
And they were.

[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.820]
What did you say to them?

[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.360]
We got rid of them very quickly to be perfectly honest with you.

[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.200]
You know, I know.

[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.560]
You're inciting calls.

[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.580]
We're off the air right away.

[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.120]
They were off the air right away.

[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.800]
And I apologize to Mr. Rogers for his fairness.

[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.380]
Thank you.

[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.280]
The rest of the staff and the two people who told me.

[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.360]
I must have been here.

[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.500]
I got to tell you Larry.

[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.200]
I take what I do very seriously.

[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.300]
Larry, he's a little emotional.

[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.020]
I'm sorry.

[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.600]
I take what I do very seriously.

[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.540]
And to have our radio station billified, done next.

[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.260]
Now hold on a second, Bob.

[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.480]
Your station.

[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.520]
I was on.

[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.820]
How long have you been doing that?

[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.540]
I've been here since 1992.

[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.460]
Okay.

[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.840]
I was in Miami two years ago.

[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.740]
The worst talk radio I've ever heard in my life with my W.A.R.D.

[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.520]
The worst.

[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.120]
You see, it's comments like that that I think are very unfair.

[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.380]
Do you want an opinion or not?

[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.020]
Do you think Neil Rogers is a good talk show host?

[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.160]
I think he's the best in the system.

[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.080]
I think he's the worst I've ever heard.

[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.460]
I think he's the best in the business.

[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.780]
Well, if you're proud of him, if you're crying, of course.

[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.200]
Neil Rogers has been vilified.

[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.240]
What would I need to do here?

[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.180]
We're tense going.

[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.880]
Larry, can I get on Neil with a cry with each other?

[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.200]
All right, Larry.

[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.000]
Can I jump in for a minute?

[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.740]
This isn't saying.

[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.760]
Well, I've got a no-general manager here who's trying to Bob.

[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.620]
If you can't handle this, I can do this or whatever.

[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.260]
I can't.

[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.200]
I never heard of worst things.

[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.740]
All right.

[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.340]
I think that's badly unfair of you and I would demand an apology for that statement.

[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.260]
For having an opinion?

[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.740]
No.

[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.840]
For saying that this is the worst talk radio you've ever heard.

[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.800]
You know the influence that you have over people.

[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.680]
Is the worst talk radio I've ever heard?

[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.560]
I demand an apology for that statement.

[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.000]
I will not give it to you.

[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.260]
I'm not going to do it that.

[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.120]
I'm not going to do it that.

[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.980]
I'm not going to do it that.

[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.400]
All right.

[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:13.260]
H 후보 boy…

[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.140]
H 후보 boy…

[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:33.780]
But, no, I still have to watch myself welcome back.

[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.700]
little one skinny face in his little slits for eyes

[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.340]
he's got slits for eyes and for brains okay rhymes with slits

[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.960]
and so here once again they try to pull a fast one on you keep this quiet

[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.360]
as though it's only that caveman neo-roggers and maybe fat hank had a couple

[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.780]
other sour pushes on ql and they're the ones that are peeing on our parade don't

[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.940]
realize how important it is they have a baseball state even time to the

[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.320]
quality of life to our community

[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.240]
see if we had like I said the other day some real leadership even not

[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.940]
forget about politicians just even in terms of a real newspaper

[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.200]
that would have the guts to come out and tell it like it is instead of for

[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.920]
whatever reasons both the hero and some sent and will always seem to be

[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.240]
pretty much in bed together why they're so hysterically in favor of this

[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.540]
thing I mean why not no sweat off of their ass

[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.800]
and the hero especially counting on everything everything that we build is

[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.220]
gonna be right down there by one hero plans to do you know goose up their

[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:39.340]
property values to make people want to go downtown is anybody here want to go

[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.600]
downtown no will they ever go downtown no no

[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:47.640]
and let me say it again construction of the Miami arena that's another

[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.220]
they're supporting the Miami arena is anybody that we know playing there

[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.420]
anymore no how about the madadors no look at this I'm giving away nine

[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.320]
period this this shows beyond a shadow of a doubt even the

[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.300]
freeloaders don't want these and look at that one just dropped off

[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.200]
haha I was in the middle of that sentence and one call dropped off there's no

[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.920]
interest in that here I played a little hockey highlight dude that's

[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.160]
probably the end of the show for today because it's something that nobody

[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.780]
cares about it would be like I do in a whole week's worth of shows on

[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:18.540]
swing clubs you know there's more people go to one panther game then go to

[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.280]
all the swing clubs in this town in a five-year period put together which

[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.320]
don't mean I'm not in favor of them but it's just narrow-casting man like

[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.260]
talking hockey here nobody cares there's no interest none zero zibbidi

[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.360]
doda it would know jigs McDonald from old McDonald

[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:32.880]
EIEIO EIEIO

[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:38.940]
right but we got to keep digging into your pockets boys and girls and

[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.920]
squeezing all the money out of there that we can't and the tourist too and by

[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.660]
the way very interesting study in 1995 before

[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.480]
constructed by me arena a Miami-Dade County study revealed that

[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.840]
less than half of one percent of overnight visitors go to sporting events

[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.400]
here less than half of one percent but let's just keep

[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.040]
goosening up the taxes on them until we get them high enough we can see if we

[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.980]
can drive some of them away we already drove all the spring breakers away

[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:05.160]
you know right and of course the frogs thank God we grow most of them away

[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.480]
because of that cheap but worthless Canadian loony right so let's see if we

[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.000]
can't drive some more like maybe a few English speaking tourists if we

[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.860]
have any drive them away

[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.160]

[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.400]
big shot because gary cernor gave me these tickets to give away by the way and

[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.980]
gary had the bris for a sunlight and even buff lindsay with her to see what it

[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.700]

a pair of course at the end of these we got a few nosebleeds in the upper deck

[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.540]
the most of these are pretty good seats but nevertheless there's no interest

[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.660]
how can the interest in something you don't understand and let me say it again

[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:24.620]
christina moron you're as much as responsible i mean you talk about taking the

[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.520]
most exciting thing in the world and making the next to sex and making it

[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.380]

neal my god i had a lot of those break yeah i want to tell you a quick

[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.740]
jewish bubble my story i'm getting married next week to a jewish woman

[00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:03.040]
fire by a rabbi yeah well i went to another service in the rabbi was talking about

[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:08.020]
the new uh police uh russia shana calendar and he basically said that it was all a

[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:11.800]
bunch of uh all correct it was a bunch of bull crap he said what they did was as

[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:16.540]
they they decided to make the calendar and how they came up with 5760 was

[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:20.840]
accounted backwards how do i how they do that well and look at if you read from

[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.000]
right to left it figures you're going to come backwards too well that's true but

[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.500]
anyway the rabbi is going to marry us we had a hard time finding one because i'm not

[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:32.220]
jewish correct exactly so the first one that would take 400 bucks

[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:36.180]
hey he marry us i thought that was the most hilarious thing

[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:40.580]
let her go larial maria cheaper than that don't be trusted out he's a rabbi part time on weekends

[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:45.660]
yeah but the funny thing was that there's actually rabbis out there that are not official

[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.860]
rabbi i know that so i couldn't be married

[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.500]
and i think you know you stabbed at one on the show all the time the white he would marry anybody

[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.360]
he would use very damn easy he was the one we were going to go to but the mother law said

[00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:02.220]
well he's not an official rabbi oh i'm not an official jew so what the hell difference does

[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:06.460]

[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:32.400]
sexual orientation of scuff masters has made it nearly impossible for the average parent to know

[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.280]
what kind of scouting experience their son can expect but one organization has a reason to make

[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:46.220]
things perfectly clear the gay scouts okay true time to set up camp i didn't did you get 10

[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:54.160]
for the day scouts will teach your son the art of self preservation in the wild

[00:29:54.160 --> 00:30:00.440]
i'm in a natural life how are we going to get the fire going that's okay we can make our own

[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:06.880]
body heat when your son joins the gays scouts he'll hear late night ghost stories and when the

[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:13.320]
severed body was found he was wearing a ton of caran on some with clashing the pelt that have

[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:22.120]
been out of season since labor day so if you want your son to bond with other like-minded young men

[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.660]
have him join the gays scouts today where our motto is

[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:30.340]
he prepared to strike your stop

[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:38.260]
ten forty five and five sixty wqm we got hanket too we got the jimmy johnson show the jimmy we

[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:43.160]
could be special johnson show at five o'clock at six we got the steed goldstein from the national

[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.280]
car yanta setter because it's the first game of the year it's the exhibition game against the

[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:51.040]
broons which are still by the way the uh the freeloading bitch that i hung up on immediately after i

[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.100]
said no she had been calling George from the moment that i came on a year mentioning i had the

[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:59.380]
hockey tickets the boy sucking around for the free tickets not hey how you doing not have a great

[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:04.620]
life not uh what's up not uh what up not just i want the tickets and the answer of course is no

[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.920]
another classic example the women in south florida absolutely have nothing to say to me under any

[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:14.580]
circumstances unless they're pitched pissed off convention nicoca kay uh pineapple ed at one day

[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.060]
but other than that they got nothing to say to me but if i got something for free all of a sudden we got

[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:24.960]
we got an eighty-year in-woman or nearly we had about a one point five year in-woman got every guy

[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.660]
damn nailed in town listening to this show but the women oh no we wouldn't listen to him unless

[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:32.760]
he's got some freedom away and all of a sudden we just had a radio accident we happened to be listening

[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:37.120]
even though those two guys those two lives used on 2800 on the dollar very entertaining

[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.500]
is what the rumor is in our sales department down to and you know something they would find

[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:46.700]
that entertaining because that's a sports station see alleged that's a real man's sports station

[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:51.720]
that's a place that they ought to be working not here by the way i just looked at the schedule for

[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:56.360]
money it looks to me like Hank oh if he's taking you i'm kipper off he'll be a professionally Jewish

[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:02.080]
on monday and Jim Manditch is gonna be on from two to six so why should a nice Jewish boy like me be

[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.980]
working on you i'm kipper the most solemn day of the year the most solemn in day of the year

[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:12.840]
i'm considering it very serially you know plus you had to finish up that story about the swindler

[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:19.580]
here's Kendall hello Neil yes sir her jigbob night and he sounds like he has a hopper to throw but

[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:24.740]
i love him he's good you know he's good with muller yeah they they were good uh i was pretty excited

[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.400]
i was pretty psyched about it because i listen with an open mind and as you know i've ripped

[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:32.280]
him pretty good because he isn't a little guy but he was he was good and of course especially in

[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:37.760]
retrospect 50,000 times better than his predecessor who was the piece of crap he didn't hyperventilate

[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.580]
during you know all those fights at the first period no and he actually described the game right

[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.380]
he's supposed to do hey but that's not why i was calling you i was trying to call you yesterday

[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:48.600]
when you're talking about guns yes i was a guy called you two weeks good i was flying delta to

[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:53.900]
Rome right you ripped me for well i ripped you for what for flying delta to Rome well i mean you know

[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:58.760]
what can i tell you i just wanted to relay you my my experience or the main difference i've had

[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:04.300]
there it was my first time in Italy and i'm very well traveled in the United States and when i get

[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:08.520]
to any of the city of the big city delay or Chicago whatever i always try to find out you know

[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:13.980]
where he's to go and what are the bad areas take the cab everywhere um besides the beauty of Rome

[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:20.360]
and the swindler in the history of it every night late night we went in there's a huge park at the

[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:24.720]
end of the event right we just walked around the park and i just had this general feeling of

[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:31.220]
safety right i just didn't feel even the bombs looked peaceful uh-huh i mean it's a central park

[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.820]
i feel like i could get killed i just felt safe for some reason right only because of what i

[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:38.800]
heard you say and i had that feeling that's how it is all over most of us in your many places that

[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:44.980]
i've ever been coping hay again the Stockholm Amsterdam the Berlin-Colon Rome Milan uh florick you

[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:50.220]
don't feel like you're in danger i loved it well i could get over there more often exactly

[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.560]

complaints either by the way like that jackass they called a couple of weeks ago oh gee i was so

[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:20.360]
scared i didn't want you to have the cruise ship first of all when you start talking to people

[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.820]
that do a lot of cruise ship stuff you know you're dealing with assholes in the first place

[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.580]

[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:33.800]
on a goddamn boat to nowhere somewhere you know you've only got so much vacation time most of us

[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.660]
so why would you want to waste a lot of it sitting out there on the open seas uh probably uh

[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:40.780]
like a prisoner on a ship with a bunch of people you can't stand in the first place

[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:46.580]
like that guy like the guy to call a few days ago was on a cruise ship i was all psychotic because

[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:50.600]
nobody spoke English and uh all the cubas that blah blah blah blah there you go pal another good

[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.100]
reason to stay off the cruise ships not to mention the fact that Mickey Harrison sucking a lifeblood

[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:59.280]
out of this town and that's why i hear a lot of things so much because they're so concerned about

they took to vote it was unanimous and instead of being on a front page of your

[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:40.240]
mimey hero today where every other ass sucking story is appeared by

[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:44.400]
Barry jackass and all her other flunkies about john henry and all the sites

[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.200]
and will it be this one will it be that one at tenor and so on instead of being

[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:50.420]
on the front page of the front section it's way down at the bottom of the front

[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:54.960]
page of the business section little story that almost nobody would have

[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.980]
seen unless somebody would have pointed it out on the air

[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.140]
unconscionable unconscionable if you ever had any doubts if you thought that

[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:06.340]
we exaggerated about the one-sidedness and the slanted news in the

[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:10.820]
hero just take a look at this the fact that they're trying again to pedal to

[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.860]

[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:16.940]
mayor pingas penny sales tax now they try to pedal to you john henry and let's

[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:19.840]

[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.760]
oh that this would only be on the ballot they're trying to get on the ballot for

[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.980]

Fred Q6 but he would did a good job nice job yes i'd like to get your comments

[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:59.160]
uh i don't see any hope for the for the panthers this year their gold tending

[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.700]
it's suspect hopefully they'll finally uh i think the gold tending's the problem

[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:05.720]
and they've improved over last year and last year the gold tending wasn't the

[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:09.380]
problem the problem was poorest defense and like a goal scoring and a lack of

[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.740]
adventure right that's right i think they have an opportunity this year to make

[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:15.860]
a playoff towards others really hang on uh on on berets me

[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:19.420]
it hangs on with the berets stays healthy all year which is mandatory and number

[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:22.460]
two again and i heard Brian last night the spokesman he was going on again

[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:26.020]
about the youngsters in the organization and this is the and i you know

[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:30.040]
nobody's buying that anymore i mean i hope he's right but that's gotten so old

[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:33.420]
and so tired well hopefully it's interesting by the way that Steve

[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.980]
Washburn scored one of the goals against this last night for national

[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:40.280]
exactly well i would enjoy going to the game the other that's possible okay it's

[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:43.140]
possible sir thank you very much hang on

[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:46.660]
and meet the good news viewers okay let's give him a these okay

[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:51.020]
that's number three i'm sticking right over here on my left the your uh center

[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:55.860]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line come on

[00:46:55.860 --> 00:47:00.520]
as the cat got these people spunked they like i said really a sad commentary it's

[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.720]
really the tip off on just how much excitement and enthusiasm there is in this

[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.880]
town about filling a blank about anything not just the panthers not just about

[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:10.820]
some stupid exhibition game tonight but about anything

[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.420]
very very sad very disheartening it's like reaching it and just

[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:18.580]
tearing your kishtis out no wonder i'm thinking about taking off the Monday for

[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:21.580]
your own kipper which i think would be a great idea is anybody mentioned anything

[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:25.100]
about that no because i think i'm going to burn in hell if i work on Monday i

[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:28.340]
think i think i've reached my quota i think the Lord allows you to work

[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:31.260]
somebody young kippers in your life and after you've reached the quota if you

[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:34.940]
work one more than that's it you had it you're going straight to

[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.880]
do not pass go do not collect unemployment insurance

[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:43.680]
i think uh this could be a very fortuitous opportunity especially coming on a

[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:46.180]
Monday making for a nice three day holiday weekend would be nice a nice

[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:49.780]
Jewish three day holiday weekend here's a mobile and sunrise hello

[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:57.380]
Neil yes sir i wasn't sure i'd get deep um get beat for one no we had a tone i'm

[00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:01.040]
on i'm on a mobile and i'm in the middle of like a monsoon down here in sunrise

[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:05.620]
there's a monsoon again in sunrise yeah oh yeah you're probably going to go on to a flood

[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:11.980]
no don't say that oh i'm not serious uh that fellow that called about two or three calls ago

[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.520]
that was one of the most self-righteous outrageous attitudes i've ever heard

[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:21.400]
which one where the benefit of having seized in tickets is that many less games he has to

[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:26.240]
listen to or watch on tv uh-huh that is so outrageous just like probably one of the people

[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.880]
that sits at the arena with a cell phone trying to make everybody see how important he

[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:34.220]
thinks he is probably standing at one of those people that stands up talking with friend three

[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:39.580]
sections away on another cell phone out raises i mean a real fan would we'd either want to watch

[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:43.640]
or listen or see again you're interested in your team you're interested in your players

[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:48.500]
out of the way and by the way jigs did a did a really nice job i wasn't a major

[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:53.640]
i owned a fan like my son's where so i didn't really have a chance to listen to him a lot in the past

[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:58.620]
but uh what a what a breath of fresh air for parents in the last kind we never realized how good

[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:05.440]
jigs was until christ uh-moron left uh-uh uh-uh he uh-he posted he really has a good memory for

[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:10.840]
fact obviously he did his homework he didn't just sit there and uh-and swab over again

[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:15.340]
he knows also also unlike christina moron he happens to be a great guy everybody here likes him

[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:20.220]
uh-ton already as opposed to christ moron who is a real obnoxious backstabbing jackass

[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:24.420]
that's right here and obviously he's gonna live down here not not up north right

[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:30.200]
well he already has a homebound in boca i think uh-he already had a place down here so he will be here

[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:34.480]
that's good i'm looking forward to enjoying him and i'd sure i could chance to go into tonight's game

[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:39.400]
okay you got it sir hey i appreciate it hold on and all the ships at sea too okay it's the number

[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.540]
forward i'm sticking right on top but okay why don't make sure this gets done right

[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:49.560]
why don't make sure we do it right five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T

[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:52.460]
while it's not you know something that's a good thing i got these nine pair tickets to give away

[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:55.640]
today because other than that i don't think we'd have any calls you know i'm talking about no that's

[00:49:55.640 --> 00:50:01.140]
right just like yesterday trying to get people off their ass although i realize it's a hopeless

[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:06.340]
situation this thing with a gun deal and that you just uh-law at a loss for words you know there's

[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:10.160]
nothing to say anymore it's just a barbarian place and uh-there's nothing we can do about it

[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:15.640]
and then of course uh our wooden vice president was on air last night with my good close personal

[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:21.580]
don't need fifty dollars friend oh i'm telling you al it's just uh- astonishing how wooden

[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:25.460]
and you wonder why bushes like fifteen seventeen points ahead in the polls i mean at least he

[00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:29.280]
shows a little sign that he might be alive not that he stands for anything good but nevertheless

[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:35.920]
he might be alive whereas our vice president i mean uh-winkin blicken and not off to sleep

[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:40.120]
to just uh-and he asked him a question about you know giving your forget about doing the cocaine

[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:45.060]
but how about uh-you know your grades in school and like and he stammered and his eyes uh-blinked

[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:49.860]
and winking and uh just answered a question okay just say something profound say something you

[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:54.620]
rip raw's p-roll and as say something but that's before the pressure was on before it's actually

[00:50:54.620 --> 00:51:01.940]
running for anything nine minutes after eleven and five sixty wqm here and beat that gator meat

[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:22.580]
and

[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:23.320]
yeah i got

[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:24.760]
a no-hack

[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:28.440]
that's why we're up there all had

[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.600]
i tried

[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.760]
a direct

[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:35.760]
but i did this song at the pain of rent it's a remake

[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:38.000]
three to the same call

[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:38.380]
as

[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.860]
there goes my image

[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:44.520]
i get some mimic

[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.020]
oh fuck i don't know

[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.920]
this is a shortcut

[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:51.300]
just the way to feel the city

[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.280]
next time i do a monkey's track

[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:55.140]
yeah

[00:51:57.900 --> 00:51:59.500]
it didn't take long

[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:00.860]
to do

[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:02.740]
as a song

[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:03.960]
to the copy

[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.820]
of the same

[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:10.220]
i guess you could say it in the counter

[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:11.640]
it's a remake

[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.740]
it's a great to sing

[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:14.060]
call

[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:14.340]
the

[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.660]
great to sing

[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:17.120]
call

[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:17.760]
the

[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.180]
15 and 5

[00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:23.300]
16 and wqm

[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:33.660]
so lesa vsachi the florida director of pickle for the american way rights free speech and risk it is an outrage for the city of mimey which has a lawsuit pending over the cancellation of the lowest van van concert

[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:36.460]
to rent out the facility to a counter demonstration

[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:41.300]
moreover the difference in city imposed cost for the two events is just plain discriminatory

[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:44.900]
los van van's promoter will be charged 33% more for the facility

[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:47.800]
and the police department also demanded $17,900

[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:49.240]
up front for security

[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:52.040]
that didn't even include fees for investigating bomb threats

[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:55.600]
$300 per threat or an edit charge of $8,510

[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.860]
if the police determined the need for a dispatch

[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:02.960]
this brigade 2506 have to shell out the same amount of concert supporters stage of protest

[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.380]
no

[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:08.460]
if not police officials must assume that concert supporters would never stage a threatening protest

[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:14.640]
why should los van van concert promoter debiohanian be penalized, penalized, and brigade

[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:19.460]
206 be rewarded for potential unruly and threatening protest by a small

[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:20.760]
fact of the exal community

[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:25.440]
i have encouraged peaceful protest by the exal community in this case however

[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:29.280]
mimey's mayor and commissioners are misusing their influence perhaps illegally

[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:32.520]
to advance the political agenda of a single constituency

[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:36.280]
free speech and legitimacy of our representative government are threatened

[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.600]
rights of Lisa Versace, Florida director of people for the american way

[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.660]
as once again is god damn banana republic

[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:47.060]
was on the verge of caving in but the good news is

[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:51.380]
the Cuban dance band los van van whose schedule mimey appearance next month had been cancelled

[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:54.200]
is not currently scheduled to play October 11th

[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.440]
according to when agreement worked out there is the between van representatives

[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:01.560]
the night center management and the aclu which of course had a stick there nose in there thank god

[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.620]
this was a victory for a first amendment printables in mind he said howard

[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:09.480]
Simon executive director of the Florida aclu which had threatened to go to court if the concert was not

[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:15.820]
rescheduled there's one possible snag los van van has until when did to complied with the federal regulation demanded by the city

[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:19.680]
proof that the band isn't making a profit and is only getting a prudium allowance

[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:27.420]
Thursday's agreement comes after a week of controversy that began when los van van's concert was announced last week

[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:33.560]
the performance of the band sparked a flurry of calls to Cuban radio stations in mimey city hall of course as usual

[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:41.080]
same old tired crap as the same old tired bunch of holios think that they can run every god damn thing in this town

[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:46.960]
which magazines we can sell at the airport same old crap only in the banana republic baby only in Miami

[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:50.940]
hey man nice going mad yeah think of Tommy yeah right

[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:56.120]
crazy old specs here's a lady in four lotterdale hello

[00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:02.900]
yes I am good morning first I'd like to encourage you definitely to take you on the floor as the holiday

[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:09.520]
uh-huh I just want tickets well of course I would but I'd also like to tell you that I was also at hockey fest

[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:14.560]
yeah we didn't mind over two and a half hours meet Pavel Burry right one of the nicest players on our team

[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:17.320]
now do you speak in english or in whiskey in english in english

[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:23.880]
okay I have to tell you Chris Wells was flooded to be with him for signing and Chris showed up halfway through it

[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:27.920]
had a face on sort of like I don't want to be here

[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:31.700]
a long push yeah it was probably sitting up in the stand because he's got so much practice doing it

[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:36.900]
you know well I kind of feel bad for him wish him a good season this season why do you feel bad for him

[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:42.900]
because he doesn't get any recognition you know if we don't want him on the team then let's get rid of him

[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:45.240]
right here we resigned with another year yeah well I did we

[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:49.260]
well because probably when we traded we want to get something for him I mean you know

[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:53.540]
well I'd like to see the same thing happening with Rob Neemar

[00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:58.460]
yeah first uh let's pack him a sandwich he's a good kid nice go on Robby we like you not goodbye you know goodbye

[00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:01.820]
definitely go to goal last night Robby that fourth goal that temporarily put him ahead

[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.700]
well let's see a lot more of that during the beginning of the season then I doubt it I have the same feeling

[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:13.340]
mm-hmm I'd like to see a sentiment come in to work with Pavel that way he's not carrying the whole team on the shoulders this season

[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:21.220]
right uh also heard from my husband was busy getting autographs at hockey fest Trevor Kid attitude problem really rude to the kids

[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:27.500]
rude to the kid Trevor Kid was rude to the kid yes you must be kidding no and uh if you fell walking on the street

[00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:33.860]
nail you'd say or does he look like he belongs in Florida long hair short I know what Trevor Kid looks like kind of a punk yeah

[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:37.440]
yeah yeah but he's not these better in Kirk Mark Lane I'll tell you that I agree

[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:41.280]
see we don't care if he's got a crappy attitude as long as he can play and it's like can he play

[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:44.980]
just like the dolphins they got all these criminals and so far they look like they're all going to be good so nobody cares

[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:48.120]
they're all forgot about their you know they're up their righteous attitude

[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:56.880]
and I have to tell you it's not the players fault for the mishaps at hockey fest I do have a friend who works for Panther land

[00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:00.560]
and selling the kid you know all of the uh anthem materials

[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:09.280]
and it was on the inside at the last minute changing where people are supposed to be they were slaughtered to be in the main arena as well as signing autographs

[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:15.380]
yeah I heard the arrangements for the thing we're all screwed up they stuck that's what I heard I want to tell you who told me that but they stuck that's what I heard

[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:21.400]
and that's what I heard and a lot of people who do work for the arena are not Panther fans at all

[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:27.420]
don't know the players don't really care yeah so I have to give you there's a lot of defunct here well they got too

[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:33.200]
many glium working in your room that's a problem well they could hire me part time for a few sparsers too

[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:39.140]
okay you want tickets or what absolutely no okay now I got uh what have I got here what

[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:43.440]
what did I do with the real good ones that I give those away oh there they are no but you don't want those

[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:48.800]

[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:54.020]

the fandom radio station down there like there see they're not the competition our sales department

[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:12.180]
this radio station to avoid having 45 minute breaks but at any rate here's a mobile implantation hello

[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:19.080]
second day two days in a row but only two days out of the year and the years got several months

[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:25.240]
to go yet four oh these people are unbelievable aren't they they come up with the stories that

[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:35.000]
haven't been invented yet here's a mobile in the homestead hello mobile in homestead hello yes sir

[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:42.380]
how you doing great yeah take a take Monday off yeah how do you like them the youth and hockey

[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.160]
you know Dennis Vicki fell down on the three-on-one

[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:57.400]
okay five six seven oh five sixty pop back 60 on the AT&T world signs anybody know what they'll

[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:01.500]
he was the money said no I don't know what they're he's talking about what language he's he was

[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:06.260]
he's speaking huh of course he wasn't homestead they're under a lot of stress there you know they

[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:09.540]
went through what Andrew seven years ago now we just had this other hurricane it brings back

[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:15.300]
flashback they're stressed out in homestead that's gonna excuse ain't it okay here's Delray

[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:22.260]
chill out hey deal yes sir I've been trying to keep my 13-year-old son interested in this damn hockey

[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:27.000]
team and they keep trading away the players he didn't know anybody so can't we just trade away the

[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.520]
Murray brothers that would be that would be a who'd hell would take him though I don't know

[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.980]
I don't know I think they could send them up the Columbus to the new team and get done no they got

[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:38.600]
done the cleanup they know they could bring Doug back no they don't want Doug back it's hard you

[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:43.920]
don't it's hard to keep these keep like my kid interested because they traded all of you know

[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:49.320]
like they get it he gets an emotional attachment to like Jovenovsky or somebody like that way any

[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:53.040]
special ed he isn't signed with Vancouver there's a whole bunch of guys who haven't signed yet I

[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:57.000]
mean a whole slew of guys who are holding out for real big money and so a special ed he's like

[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.620]
hanging out really yeah well but it's a show you how dumb he is yeah right as if he has the

[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:08.060]
skills to hold on but no I'm just thinking about you know then it's whole business about trading

[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:13.740]
away players the kids on the people they lose their emotional attachment to the team and then they

[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:18.340]
wonder why that you know they can't fill the seats yeah they're having a bitch of a time so

[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:22.340]
in season tickets I'll pick it up because who in the hell knows he's on the team I think I'll

[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:28.260]
bury they said six down one we got Ray Whitney and Pavel Brey and you know and you can you forget

[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:32.080]
yeah it's a good idea because who in the hell did they say there are six thousand unsold seats

[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:37.060]
for tonight's game so you would assume that let's see 19 minus six is the most season tickets we

[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:41.340]
could have would be 13 thousand which lasts you they had between I think 16 and 17 thousand and

[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:45.000]
maybe some of those tickets for tonight's game were bought by non-season ticket holders so it's

[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.920]
looking kind of grim as compared to last year and just like I predicted the novelty is already worn

[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:52.480]
off you know it was a new building and it was a breath of fresh air and it was a nice neighborhood

[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.940]
and so on and so forth but the quality crappy product they put out there last year didn't bring

[01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:02.100]
everybody back and it's the Murray breath is right and everybody away and also not developing the

[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:06.580]
promising youngsters in the organization like Red Warner and some of the young veterans like

[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:09.940]
Stu Barnes and others you know they play great when they go someplace else but when they're here

[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:14.480]
they just in La La land right well that's the other point so maybe you can talk about youngsters

[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:18.560]
in the organization but if you can't develop them and can't make them play good then what's the

[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.940]
point and let's look at the Murray Brothers yeah that's the problem I agree I'll pack him a sandwich

[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:27.480]
yeah maybe we can get our good friend what's his name there were the submarine sandwiches to pack

[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:32.880]
him a salad all right well maybe if you would like to let me I will take my kid to the game tonight

[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:37.700]
okay hold on thanks Delray Beach let's give him these okay

[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:44.960]
no it's great I mean let's give him these five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty

[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.700]
on the 18 to wireless land I'm so sorry that I agreed to give these away I mean Gary Sarner

[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:53.720]
was trying to be a good guy and I appreciate that but I'm so sorry I did this am I sorry I did this

[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:58.880]
no no I'm not already killed almost two hours and especially with this audience with this

[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:02.480]
recalcitrant reluctant audience that no many how many people they shoot no matter what's going on

[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.260]
you know not one call by the way about this story about the way the hero buried this story

[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:11.660]
and about I mean here's your major newspaper forget about the Sun Sentinel I mean you think

[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:15.040]
this out for the ask anybody in the world what's the newspaper down here they'll tell you the

[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:21.900]
Miami-Herald so here's the alleged major newspaper in this market playing fast and loose with the truth

[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:25.640]
putting certain stories on the front page just like they put that whole series of articles by

[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:30.720]
Barry Jackson on last year about how Don Smiley how the deal was going to go down any second you know

[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:36.000]
to buy the marlins the deal go down no was it really going through no no the take can't put right

[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.160]
on the front page of the front section right under their mask and in which they have no pride we

[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:49.720]
can understand why 26 past 11 at 560 WQ and you know people it's Friday you best good listen to me

[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:43.180]
am any interest in that resolution by the greater Miami uh no no they don't care about that

[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:47.460]
just as much interest as there is in the marlins in the first place none in fact that's probably

[01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:50.520]
one of the reasons even though there's no interest in the hockey year just to make sure that

[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:54.600]
they had to follow the marlin game last night with the panther exhibition game just to make sure

[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:59.880]
that even by accident nobody would hear it and believe me I'm sure nobody did 5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:06.260]
there's uh what's his name and pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line still the same still the same old

right in the front row now I hate to break the news to you they're very expensive and it's very

[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:10.620]
prestigious the only problem being when you sit in the front row you can't see a god damn thing

[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:15.060]
believe me see there are people who really want to sit like in the first 5 or 10 rows of the

[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:20.560]
hockey game you can't see anything because you have no angle and so like everything down low all

[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.980]
the stuff that's happening along the boards in the corners you're like craning you're not and you

[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:27.060]
still can't see anything but nevertheless it'll be very prestigious and you'll be impressed

[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:36.320]
to how out of somebody 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line here's Margate hello hey

[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:40.700]
now what's up how you doing sir I just want to be honest with you I got a little nervous for that guy

[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:47.420]
before me here why is that well it was a long pause between the asking and the giving yeah well

[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:50.820]
you had money to you know scared the hell out of the handle I'm a little bit

[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:55.360]
I thought that's any might have been Cuban you know I'm the guy who fact you that was in yesterday's

[01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:01.020]
facts about GGs yeah now I don't know if that's the same place that was in you said it was in

[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:05.260]
date county north Miami no no no it was not it was up on federal highway right by the my car and

[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:10.240]
that right oh well that's not you know that place has been there forever uh-huh and I don't know

[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.920]
what it is you know this is a long time ago this is back in the late 60s and then they disappeared

[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:17.500]
and maybe that's where they moved to yeah maybe they went there he used to be like a big uh

[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:21.580]
tower in fact I think that's where one of those um not a swing club but one of those

[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:26.740]
topless jointes now oh uh oh yeah you know the bottom talking yeah I think it's an

[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:30.460]
they're platinum yeah I think that's there now or right next to it well that used to be

[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:35.680]
art stocks playpen in the 70s too right you remember that place I sure do yeah that's what that

[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:42.260]
place was nasty but anyway um what's unusual about this GGs restaurant which is unlike a lot of the

[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:48.000]
other restaurants that are in like West Broward this place has a crowd at like 11 30 at night

[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.020]
I mean there's people have that's only way for this town because this this town rolls up the

[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:56.620]
sidewalks as you know at 10 o'clock at night that's the end 90 o'clock it's incredible unless

[01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:00.960]
you're downtown and either Miami or Fort Laudale you're not eating anywhere except the Denny's right

[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:07.880]
but uh it's really a good place I mean we've eaten there for years outstanding but I'll check that

[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:14.080]
out because if it's the same one they used to have baked spaghetti we have which is yep oh that

[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:18.720]
was so unbelievable I'm happy you could just die for me it was so good and also to talk about pizza

[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:23.840]
for a second let me tell you something these people down here don't know pizza for nothing

[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:29.060]
they the people that make pizza down here they try to impress people that are buying it by throwing

[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:35.000]
more crap on it the more crap on it that means it's supposed to be the best triple cheese and

[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.200]
you can't even pick the damn thing up you know you need a spatula to pick it up it's nasty yeah

[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:46.020]
but uh what's that yeah but you see the problem with making pizza down here is the water it's

[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:50.400]
never going to be like it is up north because of the water well this cheese can make good pizza yeah

[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:54.640]
so how did they do it I don't know maybe they've removed the ships of water in from up north maybe

[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:59.620]
they make it with peri it might have left over her it's a way yeah that could be it but uh you

[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:05.740]
know all these guys talking about jigs when I listen to the uh islanders Dan Kelly was the man then

[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:12.240]
in the early 70s Dan Kelly was the man then what he didn't do the islanders yeah he did he did

[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:17.780]
yeah in the early 70s the first couple years of the team and let me tell you something

[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:23.960]
people talk about the guys with speech impediments yeah a speech impediment Dan Kelly yes

[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:30.680]
no he didn't he's the called Dennis pot van pot va and it was two pot van pot van because that's

[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.720]
because it was frog because he was worked in Montreal before then well he called the way the

[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:39.800]
Frenchman then it was two pot vans on the team there was him and his brother John Dan Kelly was

[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:44.720]
great oh I agree Dan Kelly was one of the best if I had to pick the half a dozen great hockey

[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:49.040]
announcers of all time he there might be in him absolutely and he was in St. Louis too

[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:54.520]
St. Louis and Montreal yes oh he was incredible he's long gone though he's dead yeah he was fat

[01:10:54.520 --> 01:11:00.200]
and he's dead and his son John Kelly who's an abortion is in Colorado and just to mix me nauseous

[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:05.780]
yes sir buddy I agree with that wasn't jigs working for Fox uh one of what's in a great while

[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.860]
when they had nobody else that they could find on the street they would put the jigs on her but

[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:13.080]
I'm glad we got him you know I have totally he's turned me around in one game nice job jigs

[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:19.140]
well I'll tell you one thing for for the very least he's a recognizable name that's attached to

[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:23.120]
this team well not just a recognizable name but for hockey fans who really know the sport which is

[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.860]
all ten of us are recognizable voice right from mid year and he describes the game and he made it

[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:30.840]
exciting and he was into it and that was and that was it was only 3,500 people in a house two in

[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:35.220]
Knoxville so you can imagine with a real crowd there would be a lot more exciting too and didn't he

[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:40.760]
now I keep bringing up all these jobs didn't he also work in Atlanta yes the line of flames he went

[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:47.440]

the Al Gore-Burshu of the Locker-Rain.

[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:44.080]
I am not trying.

[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:47.760]
Locker-Rain.

[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.080]
Locker-Rain.

[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:52.400]
Locker-Rain.

[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:54.080]
Locker-Rain.

[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.440]
Would you like to see it again?

[01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:59.500]
Tango-Mucha-Polo-Sion.

[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.080]
Tango-Mucha-Ambul-Sion.

[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:04.560]
Tango-Mucha-Polo-Sion.

[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:04.920]
Tango-Mucha-Polo-Sion.

[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:10.860]
When your alarm goes off in the morning, locker-Rain.

[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:15.660]
When one of your children reaches the door for cereal and fruit, locker-Rain.

[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.320]
Locker-Rain.

[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:20.640]
Locker-Rain.

[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.020]
Locker-Rain.

[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:29.440]
Even the bizarre spark of the day, the only witness he is, it's scary.

[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:32.480]
16-till-noon at 5-60 WQAM.

[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:37.600]
If he had, I would tell you this, if he had even a minimal personality, he'd be 20 points ahead of Buch.

[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.760]
If he had like a little bit of a personality, he'd be 30 points ahead.

[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:43.220]
Here's Carl Springs.

[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:43.560]
Hello.

[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:44.480]
Yeah.

[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:45.040]
Yes, sir.

[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:50.260]
One of the reasons I called is for tickets, but what I want to tell you is I really upset about something that happened.

[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:57.620]
About three months ago, my son won in school or something like that at the Pick 4 magazine.

[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:04.820]
So he picked sports-holstery, GQ, because his 15 thinks he's got gifted women.

[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.320]
But anyway, if he picked his magazines and he picked Guns and ammo.

[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:08.960]
Yeah.

[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:16.520]
About two and a half weeks ago, he received in the mail a plastic card with his name on it.

[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:18.620]
He even had junior on it.

[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:19.220]
From the NRA.

[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.160]
From the NRA.

[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:20.700]
There you go.

[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:21.780]
They don't waste any time.

[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:24.520]
Two days ago, I got to do the Catholic Church.

[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:25.740]
Their motto was, get them all their young.

[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:31.820]
Two days ago, I got a call from the NRA asking for donation for asking for him.

[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:33.020]
They came in 15 years old.

[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:40.940]
They call them and they wanted to ask them for a donation because of the amendment that's up now and questions, stuff like that.

[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:41.280]
Yeah.

[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:42.680]
Wanted to back and everything.

[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.480]
I just shattered before I beat the crap out of you.

[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.360]
They're the kids 15 years old.

[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:48.200]
You know?

[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:48.880]
Uh-huh.

[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.080]
And they don't have any money.

[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:50.840]
One is once money.

[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.040]
Yeah.

[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:56.940]
The other thing is, I think you should take off Monday because I want to hear the ongoing story for George.

[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:57.620]
Uh-huh.

[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.440]
And if you have a set of tickets, uh...

[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:01.560]
Yeah.

[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:05.900]
If you're the ongoing Steward from Georgia Monday, that probably means we'll be hearing tapes in November of my next vacation.

[01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:06.600]
Okay.

[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.500]
Well listen, I hope you and your son enjoyed as long as you know.

[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:10.040]
Be sure and check your guns at the gate.

[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:10.800]
Okay.

[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:11.300]
Okay.

[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:13.740]
These are the good tickets, too, by the way, for this guy.

[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:15.380]
Okay.

[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:16.140]
That's the end of the ticket.

[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:17.800]
No more tickets and that's the end of the call.

[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.600]
As you see, every line on the board is lit up right now.

[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:23.280]
Let's count the seconds and see how long before those little lights start plinking out.

[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:24.940]
Just like Planko on a price is right.

[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.280]
How's Bob Barker doing, by the way?

[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:26.820]
Did anybody see an M?

[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:27.080]
No.

[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:32.100]
Don't forget to stop by the IGFA Fishing Hall of Fame Museum 6 o'clock tonight,

[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:38.540]
where QAM gives you a chance to win that Ford SUV and see the unveiling of Ford's new colossal SUV, the excursion.

[01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:42.660]
Maybe we can put the maries on it and set them on excursion to nowhere or somewhere, anywhere.

[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.160]
Here's the mobile and curl spring.

[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:46.500]
Hello?

[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:47.260]
Neil.

[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:47.860]
Yes, sir.

[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:48.640]
How are you doing today?

[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:49.000]
Great.

[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.660]
Neil will use religion as an excuse to kill people.

[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.560]
Why not use it to take a day off of work Monday?

[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:54.220]
That's a good point.

[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:59.560]
And also, you know, about the gun laws, the second amendment of an RAP want to bitch about it,

[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.540]
your mom must can tell him to shut the hell up.

[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:01.860]
Okay.

[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:02.720]
Have a good one.

[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:03.120]
See you.

[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:05.780]
Five, oh, see that?

[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.560]
That was starting to drop off one here, one there.

[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:10.140]
That'll happen because that's the only reason most of these people are on there.

[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:10.720]
They want freebies.

[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.580]
They want tickets for an exhibition, and probably some of these people won't even show up at.

[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:14.880]
Am I going to be there?

[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:15.860]
No.

[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.140]
No, no go to exhibition games.

[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:20.380]
In fact, as you'll notice, I already gave my tickets away because I don't like no empty seats.

[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:22.660]
I don't like those seats to be empty.

[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:25.680]
I like at least the appearance of somebody's interactor all this place already paid for them.

[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:27.220]
I just will have some asses in the seats.

[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:29.520]
Don't like going to a place where there's like a half-empty crowd.

[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:30.880]
It's just, it leaves you.

[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:32.520]
Except those seats in front of me.

[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:33.680]
Let's see.

[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.740]
Our first home game is two weeks from tomorrow.

[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.380]
Can you believe that October 2nd?

[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:39.220]
Saturday, October 2nd.

[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:41.020]
We've got a lot of Saturday home games, by the way, this year.

[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:48.280]
It's going to be real interesting to see the behavior of those people in front of me this year if they keep holding those little kids up in here and waving their arms up in here.

[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:49.840]
Because this year I'm bringing my machete.

[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:57.300]
And anything that's blocking my view, I'm just swinging that thing back and forth, kind of like Ala OJ style.

[01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:59.620]
I'm just going to start swinging it in the machete, too.

[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:05.180]
So let anything up in the air at your own peril, including your little punky kids.

[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:06.940]
And don't be playing that crap anymore this year.

[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:09.040]
That got real old and ponderous last year.

[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.780]
And also playing at musical chairs with grandma and grandpa.

[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.140]
Cut the crap this year, okay?

[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:16.820]
Grow up and have a little consideration for other people, even if you are Jewish.

[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:20.680]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, whatever that meant.

[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.780]
And pound 5, 6, 10, on the 18 and T.

[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.420]
What does a lot of japs that go to the games, you know, and Broward?

[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.200]
It's a real jappy thing.

[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.440]
Not so much they want to see the game.

[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:29.700]
It's just a social thing.

[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:32.800]
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if we have yum-kipper services there.

[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.820]
Maybe you in a little snack.

[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:38.480]
Well, you know, they could have a game Sunday night on your own kipper with fit right in.

[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:43.720]
They had the Panther thing last Saturday right on the first day of Russia's Shana.

[01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:46.860]
And of course, some people make an excuse to say, well, that's the only thing they could do.

[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:48.880]
And I come on here and make the same excuse for them.

[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.080]
It's inexcusable, okay?

[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:54.440]
Just because Wayne owns the team and happens to be an anti-Semite.

[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.360]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello?

[01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:57.640]
I'm Neil.

[01:17:58.580 --> 01:17:58.860]
Yes.

[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:01.820]
Just going to come to us.

[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:03.340]
Why, what is it?

[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.280]
What do you got? Like 40 pounds of mush in your mouth?

[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:07.280]
What are you saying, sir?

[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.840]
Is this the guy that called me yesterday going a little bit like that?

[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:10.400]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:10.580]
Yes.

[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.280]
What can we do for you, ma'am?

[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.740]
Talk about your makins, talk about your makins yesterday?

[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:17.080]
Yes.

[01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:18.160]
Why don't you like your makins?

[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:18.980]
What do you got to get them?

[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:19.660]
Ma'am.

[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:20.380]
Come on.

[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:22.220]
I need a bite.

[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:22.920]
Okay, bye.

[01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:24.000]
Bye, ma'am.

[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:26.320]
No, you sell.

[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:27.780]
That's what you said.

[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.720]
You sell and I'll buy.

[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60.

[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.440]
Here's the only AT&T line.

[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:36.340]
Boy, like I said, who wouldn't it be interesting if we started just for six months if we tried

[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:39.020]
swapping some of the people we got here now for some different ethnic groups?

[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:42.960]
Just for a variety, you know, bring a whole bunch of Chinese families down here, bring in some of those

[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:43.960]
Pakistanis.

[01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:47.160]
Sounds pretty interesting to me.

[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.120]
Let just a little experiment, bring some Dutch people in here for about six months.

[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.680]
A few Swedes.

[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:55.860]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:56.180]
Hello?

[01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:57.300]
Neil.

[01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:57.860]
Yes, sir.

[01:18:58.460 --> 01:18:59.560]
How did you know they started?

[01:18:59.620 --> 01:18:59.780]
Great.

[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:05.840]
I enjoy your show and you still saw my fun about the colors calling up. I just want to say to people in South Florida

[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:10.400]
I said they do such a such a such job. I said for the past couple months to three months

[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:16.480]
You've been calling up asking ask all the colors for some verbal intercourse on the on the phone and nobody calls up

[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:19.100]
Oh, yeah, today they're smoking oh

[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:20.980]
Maybe you give something away

[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:27.660]
What a such job these people do you get ducking people up they call it up and the stories they give you

[01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:32.640]
It's just I don't see how that doesn't and I don't get you how how you know for the past two two months

[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:37.100]
You know I listen every day ten to two and you know nobody's running the same one

[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:39.080]
You can start the job that was

[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:40.760]
That's right

[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:46.400]
But if all I had to say I'm having material on the outside pal. Thank you God bless you. I'll pray for it

[01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:50.080]
5 6 7 0 5 60 that's our new line. I love that line

[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:53.220]
I'll pray for it because that's I mean what more can you say what what greater put out?

[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:54.980]
I don't want to put this guy down because he was right on target

[01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:58.880]
But nevertheless if you don't want to put somebody down to say that oh searching for satellite signal

[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.440]
I means it's pouring out here again to now

[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:03.940]
You know this is getting just like Florida here, you know

[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:09.440]
This is getting just like soft Florida during rainy season which lasts from like April 11 look

[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:11.300]
Godday in November or May or whatever the hell it is

[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:18.020]
Enough with this crap already 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:22.640]
Here's Pember pine tello. Hey, you know how's it going pretty good?

[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:26.300]
I listened to the game last night. I would note the mind. I'm an I understand from way back

[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:30.400]
So I used to watch jigs on TV. I thought he called a pretty good game last night

[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.140]
But it's interesting to hear it somebody else mentions a good chemistry with him and molar

[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:34.560]
Mm-hmm

[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:38.840]
I think before was that Eddie Westfall bringing him down because that guy was terrible. Yeah

[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:44.440]
Eddie Westfall he was like it was a Christina Moore bringing Randy mollet because that's is that never

[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:46.540]
Never worked it didn't and also

[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.140]
He brought up a couple of good points during the game

[01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:52.620]
A Christina Moore never really discussed anything having to do with the game

[01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:57.200]
But jigs had mentioned something about the new overtime format right with the shoot out

[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.280]
He said he didn't like it. I hate it described the action very well

[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:02.080]
And also I was wondering get your opinion on

[01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:08.520]
Well, he said you know also about the shoot out as it stops it from being a team sport and then it's more like a one-on-one

[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:14.720]
Skills contest, you know the game isn't won that way if you're a team right that's everybody supposed to be playing as a team

[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:20.240]
They have a 4 on 4 is almost as stupid. It's idiotic. Well, it was ridiculous when they had that oiler rule back in the

[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.700]
mid 80s when

[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:27.300]
When the oilers were winning all the Stanley cups every time there was a double minor when it used to go to 4 on 4

[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.980]
Before they changed that rule a few years back again

[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:34.600]
They would always score they'd have grepsky and coffee and curry out there and they'd always

[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:39.080]
You know they had to stop them from doing that because they would always score short-handed anyway, but

[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:45.760]
Meanwhile about I was curious to see what you thought about the moving Paul laws up to play forward. I hate it

[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:50.040]
I don't think they try they try that every year. He's not a forward

[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:52.440]
It's a waste of time. It's a waste of his abilities

[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:56.120]
You don't want to do that because the forward obviously and especially that's on the fourth line

[01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:00.280]
Which plays very little and you want him to be out there a lot if they want to put somebody out there to protect

[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:06.280]
Pavel Burry and the laws out of me his defensive pairing ought to be out there every shift when Burry's on the ice instead of saying

[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:09.540]
Well, we're gonna put Peter Warrell out there with Pavel Burry. That's the dumbest thing

[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:12.100]
But again consider the source the world's a big

[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:14.060]
I mean he's got the size advantage over laws

[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:16.720]
But he hasn't got the skill is for us playing good defense

[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:21.340]
And he's a big guy rumbling around out there plus you've got a superstar like Burry

[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:25.840]
You'll put your other skilled players out there with him. You don't put a guy who's like whatever he is

[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:30.240]
Well, you see the same thing I think that we saw when Burry first came to the team before he got hurt last year

[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.700]
And it's gonna elevate the skill of everybody who plays with him

[01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:38.000]
It'll bring that line up and even if he's not playing on the first they're gonna play Burry on the first line or the second line

[01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:43.500]
Your ask any is he gonna be on the first or second line? I'm asking me that question. I

[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:47.380]
Is no is no telling with these Murray brothers is no telling what they're gonna do

[01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:49.920]
I mean my pension for me will be on the first line

[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:52.640]
Well, then you know you want that line to be consistent

[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:57.040]
Everybody to be playing up to the same par so you know you got to you got to surround them with good players

[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:02.600]
Okay, but in any case I don't want any free tickets good cuz we don't have any I don't want to call anybody a douchebag

[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.860]
Great and have a great day you too, and I want you to say goodbye

[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:11.240]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pond 5 60 on the 18 T wireless lines for hockey intensive. They aren't we maybe no?

[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:16.200]
Don't forget we got the abroons and passes game here with jigsman Donald Liet at 7 30

[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:22.420]
And then of course we're gonna interrupt it at 9 30 for the Marla game and the rest of the hockey game will be on wax

[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:24.520]
He's 7 90 which will carry the whole game are you following that?

[01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:29.440]
I mean, does that make any sense to any of us? No, but that's way see this is what happens when you bite off more than you can chew

[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:33.260]
And he got 72 sporting events going on those same time for example tomorrow

[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:35.700]
I probably shouldn't mention this because it's really embarrassing

[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:41.880]
One of the big college matchups in the last 400 years Penn State and the Huracunis at the Orange Bowl

[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:45.060]
And of course now that were the Huracunis station where we're carrying the game

[01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:48.860]
Yeah, but are we gonna carry it on the Q a n? No, no, not if I'm reading this thing correctly

[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:53.580]
Which I believe I'm see because the Marlon contract whoever wrote their contract really got this place by the balls

[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:58.220]
Not only we have to pay a millions of dollars for that crappy product from say lost again yesterday in case you didn't

[01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:00.700]
There's seventh in a row and they're now 32 games under 500

[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:04.240]
But also they take precedence over everything else including even the dolphins

[01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:06.140]
Yes, we are carrying that game

[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:12.880]
What can whatever you were talking about on Q a n? Yes, or on waxy Q a n

[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:17.060]
Well, you sure as hell wouldn't know that looking at this

[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:23.580]
It's got an inferences it says Penn State knit me lions at the Huracans on

[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:28.400]
Whatever and you can't make it your tails of it and it's got three thirty to seven of them

[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.460]
I don't tell me that somebody screwed up on the schedule. Oh my god. That's not possible is it?

[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:37.180]
Somebody screwed up on the sky and makes there can't make it her tails of it

[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:41.320]
Because it would seem to me that not that I want to cause trouble you understand not me

[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:47.060]
And not that I give a ratch-ass about the Huracans in any way shape performed because anybody with a brain nose

[01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:50.840]
Never less since it's a marquee game

[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:55.900]
You certainly think that would be here on the flagship station Q a m and at the Marlin thing we could put the Marlin thing on Waffen

[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:00.400]
Give them some practice you want you guys want to have a sporting event on it here carry the Marlin

[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:04.520]
Arizona game tomorrow. We don't want no part of that. We wouldn't touch it with your finger

[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:10.680]
Well, there's an FU with the definitive word if anybody would know it's the nephew and no one there's duck right behind him, okay?

[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:17.120]
The Bob's each wins just come rushing in the door there. They got the revised new and improved schedule. Okay, let's take a look at it

[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.420]
Let's see if I can make head to tails out of this

[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.680]
Okay, oh, we're all looking at it. Oh

[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.600]
My god, this is better than putting it on 2800 on the dial

[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:34.660]
We got the Penn State Hurricane game here on Q a m and at the same time we got the Marlin Arizona game on WS RF

[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.800]
Let's hear it

[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:43.600]
Of course, you know not a good idea of pushing people down to that end of the dial right now four minutes till noon at Q a m

[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:54.820]
Hey guys have you ever wanted to tell your girlfriend what's really on your mind like when she asked

[01:25:54.820 --> 01:26:00.040]
Me the dead well now you can with the mr. Hanky message service

[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:09.240]
A little weight problem

[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:14.900]
You mean that's right you got more kids than a Chinese phone book

[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:18.240]
What the fuck are you talking about with the mr. Hanky message service?

[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:21.780]
You can get it all off your chest and she'll never even know it's you

[01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:22.940]
My gosh

[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:27.020]
You're gonna see stags I can smell it all the way over here

[01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:33.780]
You little muck girl. I'll tell you you piece of shit if her ass is getting big let her know call 1-800 Hanky-1

[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:39.700]
Okay, 12-1-560 WQM now we're now to a precious few on the aboard now that all a panther tickets are gone

[01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:43.320]
I told you but that's okay. We stole two easy hours today my school in the old

[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:43.740]
Thank you

[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:48.400]
Just asked Bluff Lindsay R esteemed program director. What do you think about my taking off Monday?

[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:48.920]
And he went

[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:51.140]
Not a good idea

[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:55.300]
Which I really don't care what his opinion is anyway, but he is right about one thing

[01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:57.340]
I wouldn't be that much of a hypocrite all of a sudden become a

[01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:58.360]
Oh

[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:14.300]
Hey Neil how are you today? Hey, I got a chance

[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:19.920]
I was working one of the few people got a chance to be in the car last night and listen to

[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:25.300]
Well, I'd say it was part of the hockey game except it was all fighting at the end of the second period

[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:30.940]
So I got to hear jigs McDonald call boxing. I guess it was not so much hockey but

[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:34.220]
He's really good. He's got a great voice. He's really

[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:39.460]
He's got a classic style classic voice. I just I just I just love

[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:41.960]
The way he he did the game

[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.860]
There it is, you know that there was I think it's gonna be fun

[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:56.620]
Like I said he was doing the game basically and I'm also Liam is like 3,500 people there

[01:27:56.620 --> 01:28:00.920]
So it's not that easy to make the broadcast sound that exciting as if they're like 17,000 people inside

[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:05.760]
You know in a lot of crowd reaction. Yeah, I job jigs. Hey, I gotta I want to ask you a question

[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:09.540]
I know I know you already gave away the tickets for the ambition game

[01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:11.260]
And I don't want to go to the exhibition game

[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:18.500]
I I would like to and I guess you got to ask you can't get if you don't ask I'd like to go to a hockey game with you

[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:22.260]
Neil I'd like to go can't do that. What do you mean by that? I'd like to go

[01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:23.440]
I'd like to

[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.920]
Instead of instead of you giving away ticket. I don't want to take somebody

[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:31.760]
I want to go to the game with you and talk hockey. No watch hockey game with you know

[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:37.700]
Can't do it. No, come on. No. Why would I want to do that when I got my own tickets when the station buys me tickets?

[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:38.740]
Why would I want to do that?

[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:46.260]
Well, who do you go to the game with who do I get go to the game with a friend? Okay? Yeah, do I know you?

[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:50.280]
No, I don't go to sporting events with strangers unless they look really good

[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:54.320]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound how do you like that? Boy, I tell you one thing

[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:56.880]
This guy wants to take me to the game, huh?

[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.140]
Boy, does he have a lot of kids?

[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:03.580]
5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:07.060]
Beware of those lonely guys. You saw what happened in Fort Worth, didn't you?

[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:13.240]
Lonely guy high unemployment punch holes and all walls in his house. Nothing more of those crazed loners

[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:18.160]
I don't want to say that George W. Bush is the governor of a really screwed-up state

[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:23.740]
But it seemed to be a lot of crazed loners in that state, you know, Beverly Harvey Schwartz. Remember him?

[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:27.940]
Tommy Pinko bastard. Here's Delray Beach. Hello

[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:34.040]
Hello, Neil. Yes, how you doing Neil? Great good. Hey, listen talking, huh?

[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:35.200]
You know I

[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:39.960]
Only get parts of your radio station because I'm in out of my car because I worked out of it

[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:44.720]
But I heard you earlier talking about they went no Katie length from Mike length without rings back to Bellman

[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:50.420]
I'm from outside Utica not too far from you and I remember Mike Lang down in Pittsburgh

[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:56.120]
We catch it on the satellite. He's a he's probably one of the best announcers in the NHL one of the top three in my book

[01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:01.100]
You don't have any highlights of him. Do you have a big Andy Mike Lang? Yeah, who Mike Lang?

[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.240]
Well, I'm stolen for time. I can't give you Mike Lang on demand

[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:13.160]
Hear that one. Oh, I see Mr. Smartass in here. I got one that I want to play here just to go

[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:14.620]
Touching around a killed time

[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:22.540]
I don't know I think we're gonna think the panthers gonna be a 500 team if that I think they're gonna be pumped up

[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:27.140]
You know as people are gonna be depressed in this year, you know, they still got a lot of panel players

[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:31.960]
They're about four players short of a team here. I'm gonna hold back. Yeah, listen

[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:55.000]
Oh

[01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.420]
Yeah, all that brings back memories. How do you like that? Hey, but listen you see dry will you? Okay?

[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:08.300]
Get out of here already enough Mike. We're in a catch and dogs out there and that's bad news again again

[01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:11.060]
By the way, they had a lot of rain from the hurricane

[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:15.440]
You know what say a lot of flooding a lot of rain a lot of people die from this thing

[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:18.360]
No, you see those two girls that drown the two sisters

[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:22.740]
The two dark-complexed young girls in the river they were out there in Delaware River

[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:26.380]
I believe it was playing in a river. There's a big hurricane coming and flooding

[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:31.800]
You can't even the parents need to be horsewood. They need to be putting you lucky to your just a certain example right on band rather tonight

[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:33.500]
If we can bring Dan in and drive off a little bit

[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:40.000]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60. Yeah, here you go. I thought so

[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:45.400]
For my good close personal friend Dave Halberstam which is I heard a caller this morning say the Dan Kelly called the other game

[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:50.020]
He never did neither did I think he did his brother Hal Kelly did one year of Islanders TV

[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:56.860]
7374 on WR Channel Dine for my good close friend David Halberstam nice to go on Dave and great book and two bad

[01:31:56.860 --> 01:32:00.440]
That Mike Mayo is too much of a schmuck to apologize to you for that crap that he wrote

[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.020]
No class Mike may hold the male

[01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:09.300]
In fact if I you know something if I took two of his columns to Amsterdam it's not put male under fries

[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:11.580]
That's how embarrassed they would be

[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:21.660]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line more misinformation from the brilliance outflow to hockey audience than Kelly did the Islander game

[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:25.400]
Right. Yeah, and I broadcast the Maple Leafs in the 60s right?

[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:29.640]
Here's a mobile invoker. Hello. Good morning. Yeah, sir. Hey

[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:31.280]
I just wanted to ask

[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:37.740]
I'm gonna ask you a few questions about you were talking about the newspaper how they cover up things

[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:41.000]
My name is Harold. Well, I have a story for you here in Bokka

[01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:44.820]
Well, this old lady

[01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:52.760]
She was raped. Uh-huh very old lady. She was raped by a young man. Uh-huh. I don't know where he was from

[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:57.800]
But did the halfway house right around where she lives? Uh-huh, and there was nothing in the paper about it

[01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:00.560]
So that was like a cover up to me. Okay

[01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:06.780]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 St. In fact, that sounded like the rapist to me trace that call

[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:14.120]
Tele voice like that a million miles away talk about crazed loners sounded like it to me a lot of himming and hawing and humming

[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:21.260]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's Miami. Hello

[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:31.100]
Let's try Miami again. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir

[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:35.880]
I have a comment for that directly gather people calling the arresting you

[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:39.820]
Yeah, I'm on. Yeah, I'm going to make it also by raising the fair board

[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:47.280]
You know, he's a soccer really idiot. You're not racist. You can't think that jokes don't you know turn the dial exactly

[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:51.920]
If you have no sense of humor, this is the wrong spot on the dial for you, right? Right in a dish

[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:55.480]
Which in addition to what she said to start pussy ain't even sent no good stuff over here

[01:33:58.460 --> 01:33:59.180]
The same

[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:02.320]
Okay, that was great, but unfortunately

[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:06.340]
Ha ha ha ha ha not quite ready for prime time. I don't think

[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:08.840]
That was beautiful

[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:19.140]
Clean that up a little bit not too much 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line nine minutes past noon at QA image

[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:22.120]
Alonzo you're so big

[01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:30.420]
Oh

[01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:36.680]
He was a man who dressed just like a woman now. He's got a mind TV. Oh right

[01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:40.560]
He didn't do the thing. She said he's doing

[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:43.360]
Why did I have to cop a please?

[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:48.220]
My back

[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:52.500]
My back

[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:57.500]
My back just like he did no

[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:00.820]
My back

[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:03.020]
My back

[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:05.020]
Your career you retrieve

[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:08.400]
My back

[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.360]
My back

[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:12.900]
My back sporting a new here. We

[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:16.680]
Your back more

[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:25.380]
Yes, 12 14 at 5 60 W. Can I as a great column is actually a few things to read in the hero today and especially if you look in a business section for the article about the

[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:26.460]
The steady money

[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:30.520]
Of course nobody reads that but there actually are like maybe four or five things worth reading there

[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.080]
They which is more than usual month full

[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.780]
Look and this is much too boring for one year

[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:40.400]
But I just mentioned in case somebody wants to read it Claudius Smith Brinson on the bottom of the op-ed page in this morning's

[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:48.420]
Have you checked food for sugar content you should and she talks about all the food products in the added sugar the hidden sugar and everything from peanut butter to

[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:54.400]
Everything soup you name it and they're just loading pouring the extra sugar when you're killing America

[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:56.280]
Does anybody screaming about that? No?

[01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:02.160]
marijuana that's gonna kill you but sugar that's okay because we don't want to piss off those cane sugar people

[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:04.020]
We don't want to piss cane off

[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:09.880]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's New Orleans. Hello

[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:15.860]
Neil how you doing pretty good sir don't talk bad about sugar cane when you got a guy from New Orleans that's for a bad timing you

[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:19.440]
Yeah, that's that's terrible. So how's by you doing fine?

[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:24.060]
When you get yourself syndicated we need some decent listen to up here. No, you have to listen on the internet

[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:27.780]
I can't seem to do that anymore my computer doesn't seem to work

[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:35.280]
You have to have to upgrade me anyway listen the reason I'm calling is I have I've got a three o'clock flight to come into my

[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:42.700]
Amie this afternoon. Oh, don't do that. I'd love to see the game tomorrow. Yeah, you got any idea how I can get tickets to see what came tomorrow

[01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:48.340]
The only game in town Miami Penn State. I know you're a big hurricane. No, I'm not

[01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:51.240]
How could you not be?

[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:54.940]
Well, what does that mean? How could I not be did I go to school there?

[01:36:55.520 --> 01:37:00.840]
Don't you live there? Well, what does that have to do with anything in way? Let me ask you does Jim Manditch live in Ann Arbor?

[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.680]
I don't know where Jim Manditch was but I know from what he lived here

[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:09.340]
He's a big Michigan fan nearly, but you you civic pride it oozes from

[01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:12.340]
No, I have no there's no civic pride when he live in this town

[01:37:12.340 --> 01:37:12.840]
I'm okay

[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:17.520]
That's right. Well good luck to you pal. Hope you can scalp some got call from

[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:19.240]
You want what just the other day?

[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:21.740]
What you just told me about that same kind of person?

[01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:24.760]
Why aren't you a cane fan? Oh, yeah

[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:28.240]
Well, but with the five years that I bought my own I had to actually pay for them

[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:33.060]
Which I'd like to have the money back my own the dolphin the only reason I did do it is cuz bad rich head

[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:40.340]
It was great to each right on the 50-yard line and so we used to split the pair so to speak and every year for five years in a row

[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:44.400]
I paid for and the said in those 50 yard line and then we had all these people in front of us

[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:49.520]
Some of them older than I am and some of them like younger but nevertheless a variety of these two families and

[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:54.060]
Not just big dolphin fans, but half of the time especially before the game with stuff

[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:57.460]
They'd start yacking about the hurricane and oh aren't you excited about and I'd say no

[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:01.700]
They'd look at me like what's wrong with you man like how was I'm kind of like this guy?

[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:09.700]
When it comes to first of all college football is for the students and for the alumni of that school period

[01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:11.700]
It has nothing to do with civic pride

[01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:17.980]
Nobody should be expected to go to a ball game because it had a college sporting event because it happens to be in their community

[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.020]
See that's the problem this town is so screwed up

[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:24.420]
They don't know the difference between professional sporting events

[01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:31.140]
Which are for the general community at large and college sports which are for the people who either go to that school or did go to that school or have

[01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:32.740]
Some connection or interest with that school

[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:35.420]
Let me see it again

[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:36.000]
Okay

[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:42.000]
Although I do like Mark van de Mir, I knew what play by play guy that we heard is great

[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.140]
See we're starting to make some progress on this station, huh?

[01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:50.420]
Now that we ever know some of those some swill like Christina Moore and like my good friend Dave Lamont who's a good guy

[01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:52.520]
But the screamer. I mean on the games

[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:57.340]
We're making some progress mid area, but I mean there's a ticket genius to figure out

[01:38:57.340 --> 01:38:59.800]
I and you know something I went to Michigan state

[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:04.980]
I wouldn't watch it in time as you can stay football game if you paid me by the minute if it happens to be on if I can fight it on the

[01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:05.720]
Dish on a Saturday

[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:11.960]
I'll watch a little bit every now and then and I'll flip back to see what the score is and how bad we're losing to a girls team and see what's going and that's it

[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:15.220]
I don't understand that I don't get it

[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:21.720]
How can you possibly in fact most of the I hate to say this but I've admitted this before

[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:29.200]
Like last Saturday it gave me sexual excitement to watch the last part of the Purdue Notre Dame game and watch Notre Dame lose

[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:33.680]
I can't begin to tell you what tremendous tingling I had in my

[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:38.680]
Watching the end of that game and watching Notre Dame blow it looked like they were gonna pull it out of their ass again

[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:41.780]
And I guess they got disconnected the bat line the Vatican got disconnected

[01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:46.220]
He was calling that last play. They were sending it in from the sideline. That's why they had to take that time out

[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:51.040]
And just at the wrong time the bat line got disconnected and the quarterback got all this

[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:55.780]
Compobulated and they screwed up the handoff and they didn't score in the clock ran out second week in a row and Notre Dame lost

[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:59.760]
That gave me tremendous thrill no touchdown Jesus

[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:08.840]
Because their entire their entire sporting program, but especially their football program is obnoxious and most of the people who go to Notre Dame are obnoxious not all but most

[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:12.020]
Their whole attitude about winning is disgusting

[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:17.700]
nauseating I mean sure winning is better than losing, but their whole philosophy is sick. It's twisted

[01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:23.280]
They're they're just nauseating people the Notre Dame people make me puke

[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:28.760]
So yeah, I'll watch a lot of that especially if Notre Dame's getting their ass kicked I'll be sitting there squeezing it

[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:33.540]
I'm trying to think of what other college, you know like for example tomorrow

[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:36.800]
I might watch a little bit just to see and I hate Penn State

[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:40.380]
I can't stand Joe paternal, but you know something when the hurricanes are playing anybody

[01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:41.860]
I'm a big fan of the other team

[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:48.520]
I'm a big fan to the other when they're playing. I love uh, you know whoever it is fill in the blank

[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:54.080]
Even if it's a team that I hate in fact I hate to say this, but when the hurricanes are playing Notre Dame

[01:40:54.080 --> 01:41:00.040]
Those rare years when they play them anymore when they're playing notice. Hey, let's go Irish baby touchdown Jesus. All right

[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:04.860]
That's how much content in the state I have for the hurricanes and everything connected with them

[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:09.920]
Because I already had my you know, I did hurricane baseball for six years and we had a good time

[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.620]
I went to Omaha to the college world series every year. That was a lot of fun

[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:17.500]
But I got a real good insight as to what that whole deal is over there. It's sick

[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:21.720]
It's really sick. It's nausea. In fact, I wouldn't it's even worse than Notre Dame

[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:28.520]
And there's no constituency for hurricane sports here. It's the phony is devolving

[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:33.100]
How many years went by when it couldn't draw flies in that joint

[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:37.360]
They played Penn State have 15 20,000 people in there now. They got a sold out game tomorrow

[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:40.900]
And everybody's on a bandwagon. Oh, yeah, when they beat Ohio State and then they beat a girl school

[01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:42.980]
You know that they shouldn't have been played in the first place

[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:45.860]
We tell us hyper high game that's gonna be exciting

[01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:50.640]
Although hyper high at least got a better radio station. Here's Carl spring. Hello

[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:54.980]
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Is this a thicker broker central? Yes, thicker broker

[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.360]
I was listening to the idiot from

[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:00.720]
Louisiana and the one he was and

[01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:06.220]
I'm saying to myself the one reason that when you get to Mississippi you kiss the ground

[01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:12.520]
Not because of the casinos or blocks or anything is you kiss the ground and Mississippi because that means you're out of Louisiana

[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:14.900]
I mean that places it fits, but anyway

[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:21.740]
Lose around that's right. I've been trying to call you to ask you a question and maybe contribute something

[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:25.740]
But I couldn't get through because of all the idiots wanting free tickets of course

[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:28.660]
I wish we could doing that

[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:32.440]
But anyway, I don't know you'd notice I almost never do that today was an extension god

[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:37.680]
You don't because of these away. It's impossible to get through and you want to ask something or contribute something and there's no way

[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:40.400]
But anyway, the article in Miami-Herald

[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:43.760]
I don't get that rag anymore. I gave up give it a long time ago

[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:49.880]
article in the Harold who was the organization of the group that voted against the thing for the stadium for

[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:54.280]
The crazy man the greater Miami and beaches hotel association

[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:54.860]
Hmm

[01:42:56.380 --> 01:43:01.480]
That vote and and I'm glad they voted that way, but I the whole thing is suspect

[01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:09.580]
It seems well my whole thing is suspect. What does that mean? Well, it seems to me that a certain person that owns the

[01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:19.340]
Panther holdings decided to start buying hotels and I'm sure whatever for whatever reason he was for this and now he may be against it or sway that organization

[01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:26.340]
Anything that he is connected with I trust about as much he has much credibility as a clitorinist right?

[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:29.440]
He's not connected with that organization at all. I mean he's not on the board of directors

[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:34.140]
He isn't going to do it. Well, does any own hotels? Well, that doesn't make him involved at first

[01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:37.840]
I think his hotels are like pier 66. I think they're all in brown. They are well

[01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:40.060]
In that case in that case I

[01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:45.500]
In addition in addition to which why would he do that? Why would he want to like a double crossing guy that everybody believes

[01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:48.140]
He's still in bed with his good buddy John Henry would want to do that

[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:54.360]
Neil anything that comes from that man. I don't trust. Yeah, as far you know as far as I can go on that anyway

[01:43:55.020 --> 01:44:00.080]
I'm saying no that paranoid. Well, that's what happens when you live in Wayne is hiding under your bed right now

[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:04.980]
No, I got for that that's what happens when you live in South Florida for a while to become paranoid and psychotic

[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:09.340]
Yes, but anyway, um, fly if I got through them then do you put them on my arrest?

[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:11.160]
Okay, okay

[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:15.380]
Give Wayne a big kiss for us right on the back dome ball spot

[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:19.760]
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:26.160]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Yes, Neil. Yes, sir. Hi. How are you? Great. I'd like to pick your brain for a second if I may

[01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:31.380]
I'm involved in a sports trivia contest and what I need to know

[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:34.240]
You're gonna ask me a sports trivia question. Yes. Okay

[01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:38.140]
5670560 there is nothing more boring than

[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:42.220]
Then trivia of any kind sports trivia, especially, but we don't do that on the show

[01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:46.320]
I'd rather give tickets away and I'd rather croak them give tickets away again after the day, but I mean no

[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:46.740]
No way

[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:51.680]
Just absolutely positively the answer is no and if you ask me again the answer would still be no

[01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:53.720]
A 50 million times. No

[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:58.820]
Oh, man, and you're complaining about the people who got the free tickets

[01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:05.040]
5670560 pound 560 and you know something nobody can answer

[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:07.920]
I see when it comes to my doing for them no problem at all

[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:11.940]
But nobody has answered my question first of all about the back street boys tickets

[01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:15.780]
Which like I said, I'm gonna explore every other avenue because this place will never come through for me

[01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:20.840]
I know is and if the damn good thing that is they didn't postpone it because I'm sure I would have been left in the lurch

[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:25.780]
But a lot of people have asked me and I don't have the answer to the question

[01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:28.760]
What do you do with the tickets from the days that they were postponed?

[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:31.940]
Did they honor those tickets? You have to swap them for tickets for December 15th

[01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:36.920]
It's a very simple question that somebody out there must know the answer to for the back street boys concerts

[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:43.940]
Which are the summer 5th and 6th is anybody had the answer? No, why not and we're gonna. How are my goddamn tickets? That's what I would like to know

[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:53.020]
Don't think about this place can't you to anything done just like screw-in she comes up here this morning finally after my fifth request

[01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:56.260]
She comes up here and I got give her a song and it ends about the various clients

[01:45:56.260 --> 01:46:01.440]
We got in the information that we're not getting like nix regards with those 10% discount days did anything happen?

[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:08.860]
No, I mean, I'm sure what are taking at least one phone call to find out and John penis was lurking around somewhere according to her

[01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:11.460]
Did he do anything? No, no

[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:18.560]
Let me say it again. This is a place where nobody will do anything unless somebody makes them do something and in most cases

[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:20.560]
Nobody will make anybody do anything

[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:28.120]
You name the department sales engineering programming you picked the department unless somebody holds their feet to the fire

[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:29.060]
They will do nothing

[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:34.560]
And they like it that way and for two or three months I went along like that kind of in La La Land guilty

[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:37.960]
You know kind of you know talking me into that I was able to survive for a while like that

[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:41.800]
But then you finally reach a point where it becomes you know goes a little bit too far

[01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:47.260]
You're doing a green apple quick step because you just kind of like I lost too many steps

[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:55.300]
26 past noon at 560 wqam. You're how do we do it station for the 90s?

[01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:00.480]
Hey

[01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:07.160]
Yeah

[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:15.640]
Im

[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:36.100]
like plants, they will take your hand.

[01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:43.760]
We got a land, we swirled in our day.

[01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:47.100]
We look like kids in the desert,

[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:54.060]
we sing like a chastity, why does a grustain

[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:58.480]
Our agent says we got a sand.

[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:03.000]
We swim in our day.

[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:08.120]
Our biggest fans are 12 year old girls.

[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:11.280]
The secret is just F&D.

[01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:12.300]
Yes.

[01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:17.440]
As they get older they all figure out

[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:20.520]
We're hiding our latency.

[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:32.000]
One thing is for sure we get many joy.

[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:35.280]
We do.

[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:41.400]
Why does a cloud of chemicals like gold

[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:43.440]
long to do more?

[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:46.100]
The secret you'll find, gold

[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:51.380]
We think that we have better say.

[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:55.920]
We say we're not gay.

[01:48:57.220 --> 01:49:01.060]
I swim with not gay.

[01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:03.380]
Okay, 1232 at 560 W3M.

[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:04.780]
So here's the good news and a bad news.

[01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:06.400]
The good news is just like I anticipated

[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:08.440]
that they'll honor the tickets from September

[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:09.660]
whatever the original dates were,

[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:11.380]
that the accounts got cancelled.

[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:13.680]
The bad news is do I have any tickets to be honored?

[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:13.960]
No.

[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:14.560]
I have nothing.

[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:15.920]
Have I heard any more about it?

[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:16.140]
No.

[01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:19.420]
Do I have any confidence in whatsoever

[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:20.880]
that kid career is going to come through?

[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:21.140]
No.

[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:21.640]
And he's tickets.

[01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:23.540]
You see, this is the thing that really

[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:24.380]
your stunners is me.

[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:27.100]
Remember the day that Greg Reed,

[01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:29.620]
which I, I'm reluctant to even mention his name on here

[01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:30.840]
since he's in Vegas and another

[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:33.680]
beastly Reed corporate meeting,

[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:35.900]
a bunch of bull cramp sitting around with a bunch of

[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:36.300]
a boso.

[01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:40.700]
Comes in here and oh yeah, remember that?

[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:42.160]
He's going to get me tickets.

[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:44.820]
Front row, front row seats.

[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:46.840]
Doesn't mention that they're coming from Power 96

[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:47.640]
and Kid Curry.

[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:48.640]
He's going to do it.

[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:50.080]
So he's responsible for this.

[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:51.420]
And of course he's nowhere to be found.

[01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:54.320]
In addition to which he's talking

[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:55.980]
because I told him the other day to get the hell out of here,

[01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:57.880]
I was going to do a show and one see his ugly face.

[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:01.900]
Another empty promise, another bunch of bull cramp.

[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:04.820]
From a man who tells tales,

[01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:08.100]
even Walt Whitman never saw leads of grass as tall

[01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:09.420]
as the tales that this man tells.

[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.380]
Five, whatever that means.

[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:14.000]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60,

[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:16.700]
pound five, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:19.660]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:19.880]
Hello.

[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.680]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:22.260]
Pretty good sir.

[01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:25.080]
I'm supposed to be taking my niece

[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:26.600]
into that factory boys contract.

[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:28.780]
I wish I was in Dowing.

[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:31.440]
Anyway, I remember last week

[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:33.360]
we were talking about different kinds of police.

[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:36.360]
And different kinds of what?

[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.460]
Different kinds of police is your thing.

[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:40.020]
Those marijuana police is,

[01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:42.800]
can police go on and so forth.

[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:45.360]
There's license plate police is.

[01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:47.180]
License plate police is yeah.

[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:52.020]
My fiance just got a ticket for $65 for having a sticker

[01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:54.140]
in the middle of her life is late.

[01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:56.680]
What kind of a DS is that?

[01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:58.520]
Well just sticker man, that's what I would say.

[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:01.700]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60.

[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:03.220]
Too many kinds of police is out there.

[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:04.040]
Band it's bad.

[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:06.180]
It's real bad.

[01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:07.260]
Stay out of those police.

[01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:07.880]
That's right.

[01:51:08.420 --> 01:51:10.620]
Bad police is five, six, seven, oh five, 60.

[01:51:10.780 --> 01:51:12.520]
We're down to a precious two or three calls on the board.

[01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:13.260]
Do you want to know why?

[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:14.720]
Because we gave all the free tickets away.

[01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:17.400]
Everybody else got their tickets.

[01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:19.780]
But when it comes to my tickets, which I'd love to have now,

[01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:21.620]
so I have some confidence that I'm going to be able to go.

[01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:24.760]
If I got anything at all, see, and a reason that I should have been really said.

[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:27.080]
And I kept asking because I'd not that I don't trust anybody

[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:28.320]
about around it, which I don't.

[01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:29.640]
I kept saying, which there they for?

[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:30.680]
Could anybody tell me?

[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:31.080]
No.

[01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:32.140]
Like, dummy up.

[01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:33.760]
Just be grateful we're getting you anything.

[01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:34.880]
And they didn't.

[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:38.780]
And if they're honoring the tickets that were for before,

[01:51:38.780 --> 01:51:40.880]
and I was really going to get them, I'd have them by now anyway.

[01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:41.540]
Wouldn't you think?

[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:42.840]
Wouldn't a normal logical.

[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:44.600]
Yeah, sure I'd have them by now.

[01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:47.720]
That would be like us giving away the tickets for tonight's exhibition,

[01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:49.860]
Panther Game of the Bruins and say, oh, by the way,

[01:51:49.980 --> 01:51:50.780]
we'll mail them out to you.

[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:53.400]
Well, gamers tonight, yeah, but we'll mail them out to you.

[01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:54.240]
Maybe they'll get there someday.

[01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:57.380]
And if they don't, you're all probably probably got lost in the mail.

[01:51:57.460 --> 01:51:58.200]
Do you know how that goes?

[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:02.340]
Maybe the ticket police is intercepting them.

[01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:03.820]
Here's plantation.

[01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:04.280]
Hello.

[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:04.780]
Hello.

[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:05.300]
Yes.

[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:06.200]
Hi, Neil.

[01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:08.980]
I'm calling you about the Backstreet Boy Concert.

[01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:09.300]
Yeah.

[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.280]
Yeah, we talked to you before, and you said you had front row tickets.

[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:15.080]
What happened with that?

[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:16.660]
I said I was promised front row tickets.

[01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:18.280]
I never actually got them in my hand.

[01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:19.760]
Oh, that's hot out.

[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:20.280]
Uh-huh.

[01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:25.280]
Yeah, well, I was going to tell you that the tickets that were for September 14th.

[01:52:26.140 --> 01:52:27.180]
I just got to sing that.

[01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:28.160]
Oh, did you?

[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:30.180]
That they're going to be honored for December 15th.

[01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:31.660]
December 15th, yeah.

[01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:33.180]
All right.

[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:34.660]
I just wanted to let you know that.

[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:35.760]
Well, I don't have any notes.

[01:52:35.980 --> 01:52:37.380]
Well, that's things.

[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:39.660]
You should call somebody in race hell.

[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:40.480]
Okay, thanks.

[01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:40.860]
All right.

[01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:41.560]
Have a good day.

[01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:41.880]
Bye.

[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:45.180]
Yeah, call the ticket police and raise some hell about this.

[01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:45.500]
Okay.

[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:48.960]
By the way, can we get any answer from Kid Korea about this?

[01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:49.300]
No.

[01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:49.620]
No.

[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:56.180]
You know, he's one of those people he's like, you know, really a manic.

[01:52:56.740 --> 01:52:57.960]
You know, one day's a good guy next day.

[01:52:57.960 --> 01:52:58.520]
He's an asshole.

[01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:02.420]
Because the same thing happened last year when he got into the screaming row or thing with Rob.

[01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:03.140]
What's his name?

[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:04.120]
Rob Kaplan from Miami.

[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:08.160]
When they were blasting the music down around the second floor.

[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:10.580]
Well, I don't give a f about the new Roger show or busy.

[01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:12.220]
Yeah, yeah, we're busy blasting music here.

[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:14.140]
Oh, it said was who the hell are you to Rob Kaplan?

[01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:17.420]
No, that, but then afterward he said, you know, yes, he did.

[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:19.300]
I don't know.

[01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:20.260]
You have a very bad memory.

[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:22.200]
He that's exactly what he said.

[01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:23.700]
Rob said, we're trying to do a show in there.

[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:25.940]
I don't give a whatever about the new.

[01:53:26.100 --> 01:53:27.180]
You know about Neil screw him.

[01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:30.940]
I'm sure Rob made that up.

[01:53:33.060 --> 01:53:34.920]
You are such a little suck cold, you know.

[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:38.460]
What do you want to piss the men off who's holding on to your tickets presumably?

[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:40.880]
He doesn't, have you seen any tickets?

[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:41.500]
No.

[01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:42.900]
Have you seen Heider here of him?

[01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:43.660]
Why would he lie?

[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:46.820]
Was he able to tell you which day they were for, were for for four?

[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:47.900]
And had them yet that yeah.

[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:49.160]
And had them.

[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:50.820]
I don't think I got to have them.

[01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:54.920]
The one good person on that station is my good friend, Shvoke Griffin.

[01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:57.400]
She's somebody a solid solid is a rock.

[01:53:57.700 --> 01:54:00.580]
And Mark Mosley who ain't really on that station, but he just thinks he is.

[01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:02.620]
He's a good guy, but other than that.

[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:05.520]
Is there anybody else worth a crap on that station?

[01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:07.020]
Am I leaving anybody out?

[01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:07.940]
DJ Lass.

[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:09.040]
Who's that?

[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000]
The pimple with a limp.

[01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:13.100]
I don't know who that is.

[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:14.560]
DJ Dog, little guy.

[01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:14.920]
Good guy.

[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:15.560]
I don't know who that is.

[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:16.360]
So nice people.

[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:19.920]
And see, so he's another geek like the Igor in production.

[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:22.500]
We got more freaky people around here.

[01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:23.420]
Speaking of that, that was.

[01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:28.540]
Fat below was the limping around up here when I came in this morning when I came up the elevator shaft with Duff.

[01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:31.280]
Yeah, we came up the shaft together this morning.

[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:33.380]
Well, he was pretty excited.

[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:35.660]
He was at Gary Sarner's son's brisk last night.

[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:37.360]
Here's their field beach.

[01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:37.560]
Hello.

[01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:39.780]
Hey, Neil, how are you today?

[01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:40.420]
Pretty good, sir.

[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:42.960]
Did you watch, you watched MTV musical works, right?

[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:43.520]
Yes, I did.

[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:44.580]
Who's the blonde kid?

[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:46.440]
What was his name from the Backstreet Boys?

[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:47.020]
Nick Carter.

[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:50.660]
That dude sounds like a total flaming guy.

[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:51.480]
Yeah.

[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:53.420]
I'm, I've, did you hear him talk?

[01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:54.740]
I mean, he does sound gay though.

[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:55.320]
Yes, he does.

[01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:57.440]
He got like a high, because he liked the soprano in the group.

[01:54:57.920 --> 01:54:58.820]
He's the girl.

[01:54:58.980 --> 01:54:59.420]
I mean, yeah.

[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:02.420]
Well, let me ask you a question.

[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:04.360]
When's Andy from Hollywood has tickets?

[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:05.000]
Would you go?

[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:05.980]
Front road tickets?

[01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:06.640]
No, I would not.

[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:08.180]
Not with him.

[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:10.960]
I heard a rumor he may have some.

[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:11.820]
I don't care.

[01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:19.400]
But, but you, they don't, they don't, since you promote the Backstreet Boys more than you purport anything else in the world,

[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:21.760]
don't you think that they might come through for tickets?

[01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:22.440]
No, I do not.

[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:23.400]
Have you read a station?

[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:24.380]
No, they don't need me.

[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:25.320]
And aren't you?

[01:55:25.460 --> 01:55:27.780]
We're just an AM radio station that doesn't time use it anyway.

[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:30.540]
That's why Power 96 has probably got tickets up the ass over there.

[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:31.880]
But isn't that the same company though?

[01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:33.120]
It doesn't make any difference.

[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:34.160]
They don't share with us.

[01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:35.300]
We don't even exist.

[01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:36.860]
We're like, underling.

[01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:39.360]
They don't even basically talk to us because we're AM.

[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:44.060]
Even though we're building a lot more money on an AM station than they are on FM with other ratings and other big signal,

[01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:45.300]
they don't talk to us.

[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:46.200]
We're just AM people.

[01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:47.580]
That's horrible.

[01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:50.920]
The only one that speaks to me is my good friend, Bob Griffin, other than that,

[01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:52.340]
they don't even, they won't even look at you.

[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:53.240]
Okay.

[01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:55.420]
All right, now I'll just kind of curious.

[01:55:55.700 --> 01:55:56.360]
And leave Nick alone.

[01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:57.320]
Okay.

[01:55:57.540 --> 01:55:57.800]
Okay.

[01:55:57.860 --> 01:56:00.040]
I was in the car about half an hour ago listening to you.

[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:03.780]
First of all, Nick Carter has more talent than his right code than you will ever have.

[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:05.580]
And he's not a pineapple head.

[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:06.820]
You stupid fat baguette.

[01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:08.060]
Yeah. Well, I've seen his right toe.

[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:09.540]
Okay. Sweetheart and Isbury Talented.

[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:14.280]
567-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:15.680]
21-till noon at QIM.

[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:17.160]
Here's great news for you guys.

[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:20.100]
We've got that big ball spot that God has inflicted right in the middle of your head there.

[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:21.340]
It's getting bigger and bigger.

[01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:21.820]
It's growing.

[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:22.940]
Something's on your body.

[01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:23.560]
You'd like to grow.

[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:24.100]
They never grow.

[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:26.220]
But that particular thing keeps getting bigger and bigger.

[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:28.760]
And there's not much you can do about it except go see Charles Elfieri.

[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:32.960]
Because for over 25 years, he's been doing it great for God's making him look fantastic.

[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:35.240]
And now he's extended the great QAM special.

[01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:37.200]
There's another John Penis question I got.

[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:38.500]
George about this QAM.

[01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:40.920]
Is it the QAM special or the new Roger special?

[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:41.380]
Do we know?

[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:43.020]
Will this man answer a question down here?

[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:43.280]
No.

[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:44.920]
Is God damn John Penis out of a bitch?

[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:45.680]
No, he will not.

[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:49.880]
Every piece of copy I got from this guy, I got questions about.

[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:51.500]
Can we get any answers from this guy?

[01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:51.720]
No.

[01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:52.100]
No.

[01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:52.300]

[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:56.700]
Because screw in, she's another one, okay?

[01:56:57.480 --> 01:56:58.120]
She's another one.

[01:56:58.380 --> 01:56:59.680]
Does anybody pay any attention to her?

[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:00.000]
No.

[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:00.460]
Maybe.

[01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:00.840]
Roy.

[01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:02.540]
And he's busy looking for another job.

[01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:04.320]
Let me say it again.

[01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:08.720]
Charlie's extended the new Roger, especially mentioned QAM or new Rogers or anything under the restaurant.

[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:09.700]
That has to do with us.

[01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:12.080]
And then lock $300 off the regular $800 price.

[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:13.920]
At that great looking natural airline system.

[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:18.020]
Hi, this is T Gordon Lydia and they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers.

[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:26.700]
Then I think it's going to be a long time before my bike will only one cent.

[01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:30.640]
And then I own it down to a lot of gold.

[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:32.680]
Oh no, no, no, no.

[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:33.620]
Long 50 dollars.

[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:35.240]
Long 50 pocket madam.

[01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:38.680]
Long 50 pocket madam.

[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:44.560]
Long 50- Dop Bitte 6.

[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:44.560]

[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:45.960]
Long 40...

[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:47.600]
Long 50.

[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:59.100]
Long 70 pocket madam.

[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.320]
Long 70 pocket madam.

[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:01.980]
Long 50 pocket madam.

[01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:03.380]
Long 50 pocket madam.

[01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:04.420]
We got Steve Nichol.

[01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:10.220]
I was thinking about Steve Nichol yesterday about incestuous relationships and radio stations and how they always turn out,

[01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:12.160]
I virtually always turn out to be a disaster.

[01:58:13.660 --> 01:58:15.660]
Not a good idea to craft where you eat.

[01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:17.380]
You know, I've always been my philosophy.

[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:18.600]
Don't...

[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:19.520]
...where you eat.

[01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:22.160]
Always turns into a real nightmare.

[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:22.960]
Look around here.

[01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:26.540]
Look at all the mammoth problems that we have of just gigantic proportions

[01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:28.820]
because too many people around here have screwed around.

[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:31.140]
And too many people have naked pictures.

[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:36.340]
That's why this place is basically in limbo because too much screwing around

[01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:39.040]
and too many people blackmailing their way into permanent jobs.

[01:58:41.700 --> 01:58:43.340]
And I was thinking of Steve Nichol.

[01:58:45.980 --> 01:58:47.280]
Now, what was your name?

[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:49.360]
Which one?

[01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:51.200]
The one that took a shoes-and-powder.

[01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:52.780]
And left pound.

[01:58:53.340 --> 01:58:53.860]
Suzy Girard.

[01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:57.360]
The one that took a shoes-and-powder.

[01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:02.180]
560-70560 pound, 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.920]
And then of course there was our friend Cheryl and Mitch Weeney, the chief engineer.

[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:07.640]
Did that work out?

[01:59:07.820 --> 01:59:08.000]
No.

[01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:08.440]
The voice.

[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:13.200]
All these incestuous relationships, man.

[01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:14.760]
It's just not good.

[01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:15.600]
Not good.

[01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:17.440]
Not that I'm giving anybody advice.

[01:59:19.080 --> 01:59:19.760]
Doesn't work.

[01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:21.200]
Here's pompano.

[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:21.420]
Hello.

[01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:23.640]
Pompano.

[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:26.700]
How about pressing a button?

[01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:27.580]
Here's pompano.

[01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:27.740]
Hello.

[01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:29.240]
Press the button, dude.

[01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:29.660]
Okay.

[01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:35.440]
I was doing a pubic therapy on the day and there were three motorcycle cops with the radar

[01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:36.820]
gun out in the bushes.

[01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:41.680]
And I flashed my lights to the upcoming traffic and the good citizen would.

[01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:42.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:45.580]
And they pulled me over and said they could arrest me for obstructing the justice.

[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:47.180]
Yeah, well, Tom, they're blowing out the rest.

[01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:48.120]
Thank you.

[01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:50.720]
Yeah, they do that.

[01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:51.760]
No, we've had many of those.

[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:55.040]
If you're smart, if you're a good guy, you'll flash your lights and warn them about

[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:58.380]
these speed traps because obviously it's not the kind of law enforcement that we're

[01:59:58.380 --> 01:59:59.480]
paying our tax dollars for.

[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.500]
I mean, if you're diving dangerously, if you're jeopardizing other people's lives, then

[02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:04.740]
we encourage them to put you over.

[02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:05.320]
Then it's great.

[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:11.480]
But all this speed trap stuff, 99 and 9.10% of anybody with an IQ larger than their thumbnail

[02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:14.920]
agrees this is a tremendous waste of taxpayer money and public harassment.

[02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:18.060]
Just like the other day, when they took the tolls off the turnpike, which they finally

[02:00:18.060 --> 02:00:21.220]
got back on yesterday afternoon, by the way, they finally got around to getting the tool

[02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:21.460]
people.

[02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:25.920]
Or as my good friend, Sylvia, by the way, speaking of the toll booths, that was one of the

[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:26.800]
highlights of my day.

[02:00:26.940 --> 02:00:31.340]
See, and Redheared Sylvia there at the at Joe Robbie Stadium, whatever they call it,

[02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:34.680]
place now a turnpike toll booth every day or just about every day.

[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:36.280]
Haven't seen her in a coons age.

[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:38.900]
Shouldn't have said coons age.

[02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:40.200]
That's what they got working there now.

[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:41.100]
We're Sylvia.

[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:41.760]
God damn it.

[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:44.300]
So they were losing the revenue from that.

[02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:46.580]
So we had a feeding frenzy by the FHP.

[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:51.280]
Well, if there is any organization in this state that needs to be dispended, it's the

[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:52.700]
Florida highway pig.

[02:00:53.180 --> 02:00:54.720]
God, they always the tax money.

[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:56.660]
All they do is write business.

[02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:58.040]
That's basically all they do.

[02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:05.160]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the ATT wireless line.

[02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:06.340]
Here's 9.10.

[02:01:06.420 --> 02:01:07.140]
I said that on purpose.

[02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:07.580]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:08.220]
NEL.

[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:09.420]
What's happening?

[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:11.420]
Hey, a couple of plots from that hurricane.

[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:13.200]
No traffic.

[02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:14.340]
No traffic jam.

[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:14.980]
It was a pleasure.

[02:01:14.980 --> 02:01:16.800]
No road necking, which is great.

[02:01:16.940 --> 02:01:18.080]
How tall is that in turn, Plank?

[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:19.420]
All the houses have boarded up.

[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:20.880]
So there's no breaking in or in crime.

[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:22.760]
It must have been down 9,000%.

[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:24.100]
Yeah, it's better in Berler bars.

[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:24.880]
It really is.

[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:25.400]
More attractive.

[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:26.800]
It was a beautiful thing.

[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:31.860]
Hey, that church shooting and Fort Worth, a few of the people there had claimed that they

[02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:34.220]
thought it was some kind of skit because they're planning some kind of thing.

[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:35.200]
Yeah, they always say that.

[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:37.800]
Every time you hear the same thing in the school, I would end little to them.

[02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:40.160]
They said the same thing that thought it was a comedy.

[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:42.160]
But what kind of skit evolved guns in the school?

[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:42.880]
I don't know.

[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:44.740]
I just, or guns in a school.

[02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:45.380]
I between.

[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:46.500]
Yeah, who skits?

[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:46.840]
Uh-huh.

[02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:47.380]
Not good.

[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:48.640]
I'll keep in mind where it was.

[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:53.560]
I saw one Panther game last year, and it's all very score a great goal with an unbelievable

[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:54.080]
player.

[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:54.440]
Right.

[02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:55.980]
That guy is the only athlete at whole team.

[02:01:56.080 --> 02:01:58.040]
Of course, don't forget he's not playing in these exhibition games.

[02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:00.920]
Not that I wanted to screw with anybody from going tonight, but he won't be playing.

[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:02.120]
Hey, speak of that game.

[02:02:03.100 --> 02:02:03.460]
Yeah.

[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:04.180]
Any tickets left?

[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:04.540]
No.

[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:10.480]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line tickets are a long gone.

[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:11.360]
Let me say it again.

[02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:13.020]
The tickets are gone.

[02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:14.140]
They're gone.

[02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:14.600]
They're history.

[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:15.380]
We had nine pair.

[02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:16.300]
We gave away nine pair.

[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:17.900]
Nine from nine leaves.

[02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:18.740]
None.

[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:20.620]
N-U-N.

[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:21.020]
None.

[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:24.560]
Just like the tickets, I'm going to get to the back three boys concert from this place.

[02:02:24.860 --> 02:02:25.080]
None.

[02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:26.400]
N-U-N.

[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:28.920]
Did Blufflin's he take care of that, by the way?

[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:29.200]
No.

[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:30.200]

[02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:34.500]
Did screw in take care of our problem with our copy this morning that she waddled in here and

[02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:36.480]
gave me her usual mealy mouth approach to life?

[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:36.760]
No.

[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:37.100]
No.

[02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:37.980]
No.

[02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:40.040]
Because nothing happens here.

[02:02:40.300 --> 02:02:41.020]
I'm going to tell you.

[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:43.360]
They can have a goddamn volcano in their pants in this place.

[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:44.620]
And nothing would still happen.

[02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:45.840]
It is impossible.

[02:02:46.220 --> 02:02:48.400]
It is in a movable object is place.

[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:51.940]
He's working on it.

[02:02:52.180 --> 02:02:55.480]
Our engineer, he's working on that thing with your TV set on a new thing, a little antenna

[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:55.740]
thing.

[02:02:55.820 --> 02:02:58.380]
He's got a part coming over there from Bob McKay's record.

[02:02:58.380 --> 02:03:01.400]
He's going to pull it out of there and stick it in there someday to get to round it.

[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:03.260]
Here are these.

[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:06.240]
And the best part of it is these are all very simple things.

[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:10.640]
I mean, these are things so simple and so basic that a child could ask the questions, you

[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:10.760]
know?

[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:13.820]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:14.160]
Hello?

[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:15.220]
Hello, Neil.

[02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:15.660]

[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:17.560]
Clear up something for me.

[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:18.840]
Which one is Nick?

[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:19.900]
Oh.

[02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:21.800]
If he's a little tiny one or the little tiny one?

[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:23.260]
No, he's got the little tiny one.

[02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:24.520]
He's the one with the blonde here.

[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:27.020]
There's five kids in the group and there's only one with blonde here.

[02:03:27.140 --> 02:03:29.980]
Just like the other guy said before, he's the blonde kid Nick Carter.

[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:30.540]
That's him.

[02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:32.280]
Isn't there two blonde kids?

[02:03:32.340 --> 02:03:33.020]
He's not interested in you.

[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:34.800]
No, there's no two blonde kids in a group.

[02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:35.320]
Okay, sir.

[02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:35.640]
Sorry.

[02:03:35.980 --> 02:03:36.220]
You lose.

[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:38.580]
Better go do your backseat boys homework.

[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:39.020]
Okay?

[02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:43.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60.

[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:45.100]
There's nothing worse than a bunch of screamers.

[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:48.420]
Just like that concert I was up there in West Palm and you really got pneumonia up there.

[02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:50.640]
And Woody Grayburn's Carl Skyanthethy.

[02:03:50.700 --> 02:03:51.560]
That grotesque place.

[02:03:53.860 --> 02:03:55.620]
Nothing worse than a bunch of screaming queens.

[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:58.540]
Oh, gee, I just want to see those five beautiful boys.

[02:03:59.300 --> 02:04:02.240]
And I wanted to dig a hole in the ground and crawl in there and never come out again.

[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:06.580]
Only that we wished that they were beautiful and I might have agreed with them.

[02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:08.700]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:09.960]
That would have been 98 degrees.

[02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:12.120]
That would have said, how are you talking, sweetheart?

[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:15.740]
Stop being such a flamer, okay, pal.

[02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:17.340]
Here's a lady in Pemberpine.

[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:17.660]
Hello.

[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:20.140]
Hi, I'm kind of confused here.

[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:20.460]
Maybe you can't.

[02:04:20.460 --> 02:04:21.520]
What are you confused about, man?

[02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:26.300]
I'm confused because you complain about people not getting anything done and promising

[02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:28.020]
you things and people that have no money.

[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:33.320]
But you, on the other hand, have the means to do things and have plenty of money.

[02:04:33.580 --> 02:04:35.140]
Why don't you just go out and buy tickets yourself?

[02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:36.460]
Because you are no tickets available.

[02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:38.080]
Oh, they have ticket brokers.

[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:39.180]
Have always have tickets.

[02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:42.200]
You just don't want to sell at the dough if you love them.

[02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:43.420]
That's why I'm a cheap skit.

[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:47.880]
Well, we all know that, but I don't understand why you just want to sell at the money yourself.

[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:49.240]
Because I was promised a ticket.

[02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:51.040]
Does somebody promise you free tickets?

[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:52.420]
Are you going to go out and buy them?

[02:04:53.260 --> 02:04:54.160]
No, but you should know.

[02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:58.100]
No, if you had to make a dollar in the back of somebody promised you 50 million dollars.

[02:04:58.220 --> 02:04:59.760]
They say that you know no one's going to do anything.

[02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:02.160]
So why put your trust in these people?

[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:02.820]
I don't.

[02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:03.580]
You have to blame.

[02:05:03.580 --> 02:05:04.260]
You have to be.

[02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:05.740]
I'm not at all the blame.

[02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:09.520]
And as much as I like them, I'm not spending $2,000 for a pair of tickets to go see them.

[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:11.420]
Well, then that's what you got to do.

[02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:13.080]
You got to sometimes you got to do what you don't want to do.

[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:14.960]
Why don't you send a video tape to fanatic?

[02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:16.240]
You ever think of that?

[02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:16.900]
Do what?

[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:18.400]
A video tape to fanatic.

[02:05:18.940 --> 02:05:19.800]
For back street boys.

[02:05:19.940 --> 02:05:20.620]
Get yourself on a video tape.

[02:05:20.620 --> 02:05:21.300]
Oh, yeah, right.

[02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:22.220]
Why don't you do that?

[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:22.860]
No, because they're ugly.

[02:05:23.620 --> 02:05:24.160]
They're ugly.

[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:25.300]
I'll do it for 98 degrees.

[02:05:25.580 --> 02:05:25.660]
Okay.

[02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:26.540]
What about in sync?

[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:28.160]
Oh, God.

[02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:28.680]

[02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:30.940]
There was breakfast.

[02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:31.900]
I didn't even eat any.

[02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:33.760]
You know something.

[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:36.620]
There was a match made in heaven that new single they got with Gloria Estefan.

[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:39.000]
Instinct and Gloria Estefan.

[02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:41.300]
Oh, is that that's a perfect match made in purgatory?

[02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:45.220]
A group and a young lady who couldn't sing their way, not so young lady.

[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:46.600]
Couldn't sing their way to a paper sack.

[02:05:46.860 --> 02:05:47.880]
If you stuck a gun in there.

[02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:48.240]
Correct them.

[02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:49.200]
Oh, is that a great match?

[02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:50.260]
Instinct.

[02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:54.120]
Now, sweetheart, maybe you want to spend $1,000 a ticket?

[02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:54.500]
Go ahead.

[02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:54.980]
Be my guest.

[02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:55.920]
I don't think so.

[02:05:55.980 --> 02:05:56.280]
I'll pass.

[02:05:56.420 --> 02:05:56.760]
I'll pass.

[02:05:56.760 --> 02:06:02.560]
So 5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:06:02.820 --> 02:06:06.000]
Two 300 open lines for there in our seven minutes to go to the Hancockberg show.

[02:06:06.340 --> 02:06:08.780]
With the Jimmy, we could be special Johnson at five o'clock.

[02:06:10.340 --> 02:06:11.340]
Killed he'll be out there.

[02:06:11.420 --> 02:06:13.800]
So I guess he's decided to do that routine on a home games.

[02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:15.200]
I guess whatever that's all about.

[02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:18.240]
He's going to be out there being the doing the pregame show.

[02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:22.500]
Or I guess I'm assuming since it's at right here at the National Rentals Yanta Center

[02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:25.380]
before the Panther Recipesion Game with a Bruins, which we'll have the night for you.

[02:06:26.140 --> 02:06:28.940]
With the great jigs, McDonald's, going out of the game.

[02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:30.840]
We'll be on Waxi, the entire game.

[02:06:30.900 --> 02:06:34.860]
It'll only be on from 7 to 9 p.m. here on QAM because 9 o'clock we got to go to the Marlin

[02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:36.040]
Arizona Dyna backskate.

[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:37.980]
We're pretty embarrassed by it.

[02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:42.000]
We're putting that game on surf on 15, 80 tomorrow.

[02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:43.280]
Jack Mark's station.

[02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:43.820]
How do you like that?

[02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:47.300]
Here's a mobile in Miami B.

[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:47.740]
Chill out.

[02:06:49.540 --> 02:06:50.060]
Hello, okay.

[02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:50.300]
Hear me?

[02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:50.680]
Yes, sir.

[02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:51.300]
I hear you.

[02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:52.280]
I do, I'm Neil.

[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:52.640]
Okay.

[02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:53.820]
I call her a long time, Julio.

[02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:57.200]
You know, you like WhisMiguet like her that, do you?

[02:06:57.200 --> 02:06:57.700]
I love WhisMiguet.

[02:06:58.300 --> 02:07:00.680]
Have you heard of this Alejandro Fernandez?

[02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:01.440]
No.

[02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:02.700]
Oh, man.

[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:06.520]
Maybe your producer has something there, but he's good.

[02:07:06.860 --> 02:07:07.600]
No, never heard of it.

[02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:08.240]
No, there he is.

[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:09.260]
Nobody here ever heard him.

[02:07:09.860 --> 02:07:10.940]
Oh, he's great boy.

[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:11.220]
He's having.

[02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:13.640]
Take my advice and listen to one of these songs.

[02:07:13.820 --> 02:07:14.040]
Okay.

[02:07:14.620 --> 02:07:15.380]
All right, Chenyar.

[02:07:15.580 --> 02:07:15.800]
Okay.

[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:16.440]
Have a good one.

[02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:17.020]
How do you...

[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:20.600]
Alejandro Schwartz, I don't know what he said.

[02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:22.300]
But this don't start that we don't have it anyway.

[02:07:22.460 --> 02:07:23.700]
If we had it, I'd listen to it.

[02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:28.200]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:07:28.460 --> 02:07:29.300]
600 open lines.

[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:30.640]
Do we have any more tickets to give away?

[02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:30.900]
No.

[02:07:31.060 --> 02:07:31.160]
No.

[02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:34.400]
And as far as some young bitch call in here, give me a lecture again.

[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:36.680]
This is getting really ponderous, you know?

[02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:41.320]
Getting lectured by these righteous women out there who are the first ones to free load.

[02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:42.680]
Any goddamn thing they can get?

[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:43.980]
The worst.

[02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:49.300]
You notice how many women I had in the first to 40 minutes after I mentioned a hockey game this morning?

[02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:52.600]
Usually, we don't get that many women in the whole show every day on this show.

[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:55.900]
But once we got something to give away, all of a sudden they're all coming out of the woodwork.

[02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:57.380]
They're all so friendly and they love me.

[02:07:57.460 --> 02:07:58.400]
Not that the tickets are gone.

[02:07:58.600 --> 02:07:59.760]
Now they're calling to bitch me out.

[02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:04.680]
Because I'm a cheap prick and I don't want to spend 45 grand to go see the guy named Backstreet Boys.

[02:08:06.300 --> 02:08:07.540]
Here's a four-letter deal, huh?

[02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:08.400]
Hey, Dale.

[02:08:08.660 --> 02:08:08.940]
Yes, sir.

[02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:12.240]
I know how we can put the FHB out of business.

[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:12.620]
Yeah.

[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:14.860]
Nobody goes feeding for about a year.

[02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:16.740]
And everybody will go out of business.

[02:08:17.340 --> 02:08:17.860]
Yeah, good point.

[02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:18.960]
Hey, you know how I did.

[02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:20.220]
Did you slow down?

[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:24.420]
Did you see the Perng Green show last week when he was in coming with the Flamingo?

[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:26.160]
Yeah, and that was a repeat, I really sat.

[02:08:26.340 --> 02:08:27.100]
Oh, I didn't see that.

[02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:29.500]
I just started writing this and he started talking about it.

[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:31.020]
He is running here.

[02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:33.460]
The guy in the show that heard that, uh, uh,

[02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:35.440]
heard Backstreet, we're on the track, eh?

[02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:36.080]
Mm-hmm.

[02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:41.340]
That's my man in front of me.

[02:08:41.340 --> 02:08:41.480]
That's my man in front of me.

[02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:42.440]
Hey, I love your show, Dale.

[02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:42.900]
Have a good day.

[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:43.260]
See ya.

[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:44.760]
I missed the show last night.

[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:45.900]
Did you see it?

[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:47.220]
Was it a repeat or something?

[02:08:47.460 --> 02:08:47.680]
Repeat.

[02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:50.280]
Oh, a clip show of all the old stuff like the Dead Guy.

[02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:50.640]
Oh, yeah.

[02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:51.540]
Yeah, I forgot.

[02:08:51.540 --> 02:08:51.940]
Thank God.

[02:08:51.980 --> 02:08:52.920]
Because I forgot all about it.

[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.660]
How could I forget about the Time Green show Thursday that's all you live for is the Time Green

[02:08:56.660 --> 02:08:56.960]
show.

[02:08:57.600 --> 02:08:59.080]
So thank God it was a repeat again.

[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:04.020]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:06.760]
Let's call up Neal and bitch him up for being such a cheap bastard.

[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:10.520]
Let him go spend his own goddamn money for tickets and stop up being such a jackass.

[02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:10.860]
Okay?

[02:09:11.140 --> 02:09:11.520]
Good point.

[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:12.480]
Excellent points, sweetheart.

[02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:14.620]
Yeah, I'm real cheap.

[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:17.940]
Just ask anybody that I buy all those goddamn meals for not to mention any names.

[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:20.780]
What a cheap bastard I am.

[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:21.920]
Of course they aren't always the best.

[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:22.480]
They stuck.

[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:23.020]
Yeah, right.

[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:27.580]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:09:27.660 --> 02:09:28.800]
I can't say that anymore.

[02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:29.380]
How do you like that?

[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:30.100]
I keep saying TD.

[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:33.160]
12, 56, it's 5, 60, WQAM.

[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:45.360]

4, 6, 7, 05, 60 on the AT&T.

4, 6, 7, 05, 60 on the AT&T.

4, 6, 7, 05, 60 on the AT&T.

4, 6, 7, 05, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:03.760]
Ah, ah!

[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:11.400]
And, man, Mr. Tom Broca has an excellent examination of the district of Amsterdam.

[02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:14.360]
As the as Tom Broca in New York,

[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:18.320]
Yo, Tengo, and Reporto de las Senoras,

[02:10:18.700 --> 02:10:20.860]
Kate Danzo, and El Bafo,

No, mi esposa es un lesbiano.

[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:35.720]
Me es muy cool.

[02:10:37.140 --> 02:10:37.860]
Ven a la mente.

[02:10:38.300 --> 02:10:40.440]
En la película de la tretenoche,

[02:10:41.020 --> 02:10:43.320]

[02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:45.200]
En brinde!

Solamente, en univision.

[02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:52.020]
101 at 5, 60 WQ Amigo,

[02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:53.420]
as much as I like the Back Speed Boys,

[02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:56.120]
I must confess that such a large number of their fans

[02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:59.040]
are not just young girls, neurotic young girls.

[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:00.820]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:03.340]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:11:03.460 --> 02:11:04.000]
Here's Weston.

[02:11:04.100 --> 02:11:04.240]
Hello.

[02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:05.260]
Neil.

[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:05.820]
Yes, sir.

[02:11:05.940 --> 02:11:06.520]
How are you today?

[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:06.900]
Great.

[02:11:07.340 --> 02:11:08.300]
I got a couple things for you.

[02:11:08.420 --> 02:11:12.060]
First of all, that woman was only upset with you because you gave away all the hockey tickets

[02:11:12.060 --> 02:11:13.100]
before she can get any.

[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:13.660]
Yeah.

[02:11:14.140 --> 02:11:16.160]
And, ah, in yesterday's paper,

[02:11:16.620 --> 02:11:20.360]
did you happen to see the article by Jose Lambert,

[02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:23.500]
the naked truth about browse undercover cops?

[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:24.680]
Jose Lambert, yes.

[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:25.840]
Here's all the article.

[02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:28.040]
That was the same article that had the Erich Sanchez at Kinziathing.

[02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:29.060]
No, okay.

[02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:30.140]
Just want to see if you saw it.

[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:30.360]
Yes.

[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:31.180]
That's all I have.

[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:31.800]
Okay, thanks.

[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:32.260]
That's a great day.

[02:11:32.900 --> 02:11:36.040]
Okay, don't do as we do, do as we say, but that's the same old tire thing

[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:37.300]
that nobody out there cares above.

[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:39.260]
You've been conditioned to it, just like all the shootings,

[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:41.300]
just like all the blood and guts in the dines

[02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:42.080]
and the kid's unstretched.

[02:11:42.420 --> 02:11:43.360]
You've been conditioned to it,

[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:43.980]
and you accept it.

[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:45.620]
And there's nothing I can do to change it.

[02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:49.440]
You accept it, you know, better you than me.

[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:50.280]
That's all I can tell you.

[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:52.400]
This is not a way for civilized people to live.

[02:11:52.540 --> 02:11:54.040]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[02:11:54.500 --> 02:11:56.760]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:59.700]
So when are you going to give away those backstreet boys' tickets?

[02:12:01.220 --> 02:12:02.460]
They're calling for that now.

[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:05.880]
You can't say the word tickets without them presuming that it is them.

[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:06.380]
Now who's them?

[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:07.160]
Them, them.

[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:07.900]
Who's the name female?

[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:10.840]
A female.

[02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:12.660]
No, straight men are calling for backstreet boys.

[02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:13.840]
I don't have to start that crap again.

[02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:14.540]
Who else?

[02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:14.900]
Female.

[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:15.900]
How do you like that?

[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:17.340]
Women calling in for backstreet.

[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:20.560]
Okay, we got 10 pair of tickets for the December 5th backstreet boys concert.

[02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:21.820]
First 10 callers here.

[02:12:22.140 --> 02:12:26.020]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:12:26.500 --> 02:12:26.860]
Not.

[02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:31.140]
Here's Miami.

[02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:31.400]
Hello.

[02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:34.300]
There's the line 8 syndrome.

[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:35.440]
Okay, let's hear it.

[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:38.360]
Get in some relaxion on that phone system.

[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:39.220]
Are we around this joint?

[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:40.180]
No, we're not.

[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:40.680]
No.

[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:42.780]
Not can any action on anything.

[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:43.760]
We're getting some lip service.

[02:12:44.940 --> 02:12:46.680]
Because one thing about this place, baby.

[02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:52.500]
Everybody in this place, they have not only one, but they've got two sets of red.

[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:53.080]
That's right.

[02:12:53.180 --> 02:12:54.200]
That's why I get a lot of lip service.

[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:54.800]
Not much else.

[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:55.460]
Just talk.

[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:01.820]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:04.400]
Here's the mobile in for Lauderdale.

[02:13:04.580 --> 02:13:04.660]
Hello.

[02:13:05.660 --> 02:13:08.040]
Neil, I bet you got women that call on a source.

[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:09.580]
Turned hot right into a vagina.

[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:16.900]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 while you out on Opel and pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:19.960]
They got this good blue stuff they sell at the drugstore.

[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:21.780]
Kills crabs, too.

[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:23.720]
Here's the Pemberk pie and tell her.

[02:13:24.620 --> 02:13:27.180]
I think I'd look at that that I'm not on that line 8, I guess.

[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:29.980]
Anyway, one to tie it first off.

[02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:32.640]
You know why the hurricanes are so terrible.

[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:33.760]
Look at the word it is.

[02:13:33.900 --> 02:13:35.000]
It's in Miami itself.

[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:37.740]
Any other school in this country is so much better than that.

[02:13:38.540 --> 02:13:38.900]
Would you agree?

[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:40.460]
What does that mean?

[02:13:40.620 --> 02:13:42.720]
Well, I mean, what does anything mean that you just said?

[02:13:42.740 --> 02:13:43.800]
Look at the neighborhood.

[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:45.660]
It's Miami.

[02:13:46.380 --> 02:13:48.420]
Of course, the school is going to be terrible and everything like that.

[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:49.820]
Who said the school was terrible?

[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:50.640]
What are you talking about?

[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:51.560]
I'm talking about this yesterday.

[02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:52.700]
What is sucking call?

[02:13:52.780 --> 02:13:53.380]
Is that what this is?

[02:13:53.620 --> 02:13:55.020]
I think the answer very clearly is.

[02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:55.300]
Yeah.

[02:13:55.580 --> 02:13:55.740]
Yeah.

[02:13:56.780 --> 02:13:57.700]
You're boring, sir.

[02:13:57.800 --> 02:13:58.280]
You're terminal.

[02:13:58.500 --> 02:13:59.540]
See, there's nothing to me.

[02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:02.500]
Well, I won't say there's nothing, but there are a few things in the world worse than me.

[02:14:02.780 --> 02:14:06.080]
Then people are just want to repeat back like a periket, like a mine of birds.

[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:10.180]
Just repeat back what you've already said, just to ingratiate themselves and suck around.

[02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:11.800]
Enough of the sucking pal.

[02:14:14.300 --> 02:14:15.720]
Has nothing to do with the neighborhood.

[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:17.280]
You have him stands on its own.

[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:19.700]
Regardless of where you put it, it stands on its own.

[02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:20.760]
It is what it is.

[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:24.200]
It's La La land for sport little rich kids.

[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:29.880]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[02:14:30.500 --> 02:14:34.840]
And like I said, the sports nerds at those dolphin games who thought that just because I was at a dolphin game,

[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:37.200]
naturally, I wanted to yent it with them about the hurricane.

[02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:39.140]
Those people need a lot of bottomies, man.

[02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:41.240]
Oh, what a breath of fresh air.

[02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:44.800]
It is to be able to sit at home and watch in peace of the games without being in the middle of that crowd.

[02:14:46.500 --> 02:14:48.200]
And they got their headsets on.

[02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:52.060]
They're with their Sony Walkman and they're like, well, you're right there on the 50 yard line.

[02:14:52.180 --> 02:14:55.960]
What in the world could you possibly need a headset when you were in a goddamn ballgame for?

[02:14:56.220 --> 02:14:57.900]
Unless you don't understand what the hell is going on.

[02:14:58.540 --> 02:14:59.480]
What is that all about?

[02:15:01.940 --> 02:15:03.160]
Here's a mobile and crawl spring.

[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:03.520]
Hello?

[02:15:04.340 --> 02:15:07.380]
I didn't call for tickets to the back door boys concert.

[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:09.760]
But I was just going to give my way too.

[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:11.580]
I was, that's okay.

[02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:12.320]
Maybe next time.

[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:15.120]
Hey, you know, the thing with the shootings in Texas.

[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:23.800]
Well, one of the most absurd things that exists in this wonderful banana republic of ours is the fact that

[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:29.960]
if you wanted to buy a bottle of wine from the state of California and have it shipped into you,

[02:15:30.340 --> 02:15:37.800]
the liquor distributors have banded together to buy off a sufficient number of state legislators to make that crime a felony.

[02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:46.520]
Whereas if you want to go out and buy yourself a nice 38 special, there's no problem with buying that and having it shipped into the state.

[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:52.780]
And the rationale that they use for it is that they don't want kids to be able to buy liquor online.

[02:15:53.820 --> 02:16:03.760]
So you know that this stops every 15-year-old from buying a $75 bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon to get his date wasted so he can get in her knickers.

[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:09.860]
But God forbid they should prevent a kid from buying a 38 special that he needs to protect himself in school.

[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:17.200]
Just another case of the gun lobby having everybody in their brother in their toilet.

[02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:24.040]
Forget about 5 mail, those kids in Denver were two young to buy cigarettes or two young to buy a bottle of beer,

[02:16:24.260 --> 02:16:25.500]
but they rolled them off to buy a gun.

[02:16:25.940 --> 02:16:27.200]
Yeah, I'm American, I've been way, man.

[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:31.120]
Well, and supposedly this guy in Texas bought his guns at a flea market.

[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:35.060]
Great, great, great society we live in isn't it?

[02:16:35.100 --> 02:16:38.500]
By the way, I'd like to point out to you, including this next upcoming break, we're still running spots.

[02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:46.940]
It is done, sure, even after the slaughter we had in Fort Worth, we don't have the common decency to, you know, like most anyplace else where the postpone those spots or the cancel over something like that.

[02:16:47.420 --> 02:16:48.440]
And that shows spots?

[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:49.500]
That's weak.

[02:16:50.020 --> 02:16:51.960]
On our horror station, okay, sir. God bless you.

[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:52.600]
Take care.

[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:53.260]
Head for the hills.

[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:58.580]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T.

[02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:16.040]
I mean, it just, it's just mind boggling to me the fact that screw and winek stood here this morning with a real pasty look on her voice acting like she really was concerned about these things that I was asking about that I was upset about that we need to do something about and I told her and did anything whatsoever happened in the last three hours in eight minutes.

[02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:17.960]
No, no, nothing.

[02:17:20.420 --> 02:17:23.660]
This is the place where time stands still.

[02:17:24.900 --> 02:17:32.180]
And our program director who's got the best of intentions and the talk should would game the problem is everybody laughs at him nobody pays any attention to him.

[02:17:32.860 --> 02:17:40.340]
So I can talk to him about 50 million things and he can have his little checklist and tell me about oh this one's working on this and that one's working on Uranus and so on and so forth.

[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:41.360]
It means nothing.

[02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:43.880]
It means nothing.

[02:17:45.020 --> 02:17:46.580]
They're not calling for those tickets, right?

[02:17:48.900 --> 02:17:49.880]
Please tell me now.

[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:56.720]
You haven't been watching and that's what they're calling for WQA am ticket central.

[02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:58.580]
Hi, I want to talk about the back shoe boys.

[02:17:58.760 --> 02:17:59.980]
Yes, I don't want to take it so.

[02:18:00.180 --> 02:18:01.560]
Okay, what do you want to say?

[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:02.940]
I want to talk about AJ.

[02:18:03.620 --> 02:18:05.720]
Yeah, video and Tom Green.

[02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:06.420]
Yes.

[02:18:06.620 --> 02:18:07.460]
Is that cool?

[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:08.180]
You're on now.

[02:18:09.780 --> 02:18:12.360]
I think that AJ should be replaced by Tom Green.

[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:13.740]
What do you think of that?

[02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:17.060]
Oh, there's John penis and why is that way to hang on a second?

[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:19.020]
Why is Todd Drek standing in the background?

[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:22.400]
Is this a new vlog director like that we got here?

[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:25.680]
John penis and Todd Drek, like everything's a big joke.

[02:18:25.940 --> 02:18:33.800]
If you buy spots on this station and want you to know that our sales department considers a big joke, I just heard a rumor by the way that those two are going down to laugh and that's the rumor.

[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:35.500]
That's why they're not taking care of any spots.

[02:18:36.900 --> 02:18:37.820]
That's how it always is.

[02:18:37.920 --> 02:18:40.280]
Guys start slacking off when you're leaving and moving to another joint.

[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:44.100]
Probably those two guys that enjoy the two live Jews that are mid days on laughing.

[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:51.620]
They're the ones that are starting that crap because anybody that even planned on staying in their job couldn't possibly slack off even in this joint like they are.

[02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:53.060]
And what were you saying?

[02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:53.440]
I'm sorry.

[02:18:54.940 --> 02:18:55.380]
Hello.

[02:18:55.600 --> 02:18:55.900]
Hi.

[02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:56.760]
Yes, I'm sorry.

[02:18:56.860 --> 02:18:57.580]
Go ahead.

[02:18:58.200 --> 02:18:59.860]
I think Tom Green should replace AJ.

[02:19:00.140 --> 02:19:00.280]
No.

[02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:00.840]
Why?

[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:03.920]
Because they would make a mockery, would make a farce.

[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:08.060]
As much as I love Tom Green, that video about his bum and his duty.

[02:19:08.060 --> 02:19:09.440]
Yeah, I agree that was really stupid.

[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:10.920]
That was really, and too long too.

[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:14.160]
But what's up with AJ and we're in Britney Spears shirt on this video?

[02:19:14.580 --> 02:19:15.540]
You've seen the video, right?

[02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:16.380]
So what's wrong with that?

[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:17.940]
What's going on with that?

[02:19:18.020 --> 02:19:20.140]
He's jealous and addicted, which he's already got a girlfriend, you know?

[02:19:20.700 --> 02:19:20.880]
Who?

[02:19:21.260 --> 02:19:21.500]
AJ.

[02:19:21.880 --> 02:19:22.400]
AJ, I know.

[02:19:23.060 --> 02:19:23.980]
I know who she is.

[02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:24.220]
Yeah.

[02:19:24.340 --> 02:19:25.400]
Who man, if she's in his mother group.

[02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:26.020]
And?

[02:19:26.620 --> 02:19:27.440]
No, I'm just saying.

[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:30.940]
I don't like what is so good about the backshort boys that you love them so much.

[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:33.800]
Then why are you worried about what's shirt AJ is wearing?

[02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:34.580]
What difference does it make?

[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:35.960]
No, it doesn't make a difference at all.

[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:36.620]
Okay, Tom, thank you.

[02:19:38.900 --> 02:19:42.480]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T Rival Slime.

[02:19:42.600 --> 02:19:43.460]
I have to like their music.

[02:19:43.460 --> 02:19:47.200]
I know all these other things about the shirts that they wear and about Nick's toe and about his hair.

[02:19:47.380 --> 02:19:48.400]
I don't care about any of that.

[02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:51.080]
None of them are in the least bit interesting to me in that way.

[02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:53.580]
Not even marginally, not minimally.

[02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:56.080]
Not even a little teeny-weeny.

[02:19:56.460 --> 02:19:56.580]
One.

[02:19:57.240 --> 02:19:59.140]
10 past one at 5, 60, QA.

[02:19:59.140 --> 02:19:59.440]
I'm Hollywood.

[02:19:59.580 --> 02:20:00.620]
Oh God, Neil.

[02:20:21.400 --> 02:20:22.200]
I'm Hollywood.

[02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:23.660]

[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:23.680]

[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:23.680]

[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:23.680]

[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:23.680]

[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:23.680]

[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:23.680]

[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:23.680]

[02:20:24.260 --> 02:20:24.440]
I'm Hollywood.

[02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:25.000]
I'm Hollywood.

[02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:25.540]
I'm Hollywood.

[02:20:25.540 --> 02:20:25.540]

[02:20:25.540 --> 02:20:25.560]
I'm Hollywood.

[02:20:25.620 --> 02:20:25.620]

[02:20:25.620 --> 02:20:25.620]

[02:20:25.780 --> 02:20:25.780]

[02:20:25.900 --> 02:20:25.900]

[02:20:25.900 --> 02:20:25.900]

[02:20:25.900 --> 02:20:25.900]

[02:20:25.900 --> 02:20:25.900]

[02:20:25.900 --> 02:20:25.900]

[02:20:26.180 --> 02:20:26.580]
I'm Hollywood.

[02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:30.480]
I'm Hollywood.

[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:30.480]

[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:30.480]

[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:30.480]

[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:30.480]

[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:30.540]
I'm Hollywood.

[02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:31.000]
I'm Hollywood.

[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:32.040]
Are they original tunes like this?

[02:20:32.260 --> 02:20:33.500]
I'd like to be.

[02:20:34.800 --> 02:20:36.380]
Make the surface of the ocean.

[02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:38.780]
In and eight arms, sieg reaches cultivation.

[02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:39.540]
That's what you...

[02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:42.860]
Oh, Azise, don't let it be, we'll move you.

[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:44.080]
It will pound you.

[02:20:44.580 --> 02:20:46.760]
It will make John Lennon spin in his grave.

[02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:48.540]
And that's a conclusion.

[02:20:50.520 --> 02:20:52.680]
The love you receive.

[02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:54.400]
Oh...

[02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:58.400]
Is directly pushing it to the moon.

[02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:07.200]
And look for no-gabbiger's new solo L.C. Abbey Highway on SNF R.

[02:23:29.380 --> 02:23:38.820]
Oh, right.

[02:23:38.820 --> 02:23:56.080]

[02:42:37.540 --> 02:42:41.140]
And Mr. Snuffle Avogus is the hilarious astronaut swung.

[02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:43.840]
Oh I keep stepping on my big head.

[02:42:44.780 --> 02:42:49.180]
Catch the whole crew is they guide their missile of love to the outer limits of the universe.

[02:42:49.180 --> 02:42:52.980]
Will there walk its powered parrots 501's ever make it home?

[02:42:53.040 --> 02:42:56.300]
No it's a little smelly in here but I kind of like it.

[02:42:56.320 --> 02:42:59.020]
Don't miss but growing this out of this world adventure ever.

[02:42:59.220 --> 02:43:01.720]
Dance office in space.

[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:04.220]
Greg there's a fight there's a fight.

[02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:10.280]
145 at five sixty WQM stop by the IGFA Fishing Hall of Fame and Museum

[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:14.660]
to nine to six o'clock as QM gives you chance to win a Ford SUV and see the unveiling

[02:43:14.660 --> 02:43:18.020]
of Ford's brand new colossal SUV the excursion.

[02:43:20.060 --> 02:43:24.360]
Oh I'm just worn out I'm just this has been a draining experience especially

[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:26.160]
hearing that instinct thing over the phone.

[02:43:26.380 --> 02:43:28.780]
See they've been ecasing and you're way back in the other room there.

[02:43:28.840 --> 02:43:29.520]
Oh it's great yeah.

[02:43:30.260 --> 02:43:32.980]
See you told me they suck they suck sweetheart.

[02:43:33.720 --> 02:43:37.300]
They're grotesque they're nauseating I hope they allay low but glory as Stefan and

[02:43:37.300 --> 02:43:37.920]
a rugby husband.

[02:43:40.180 --> 02:43:41.900]
Here's a mobile in four-lotterdale hello.

[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:45.200]
Mobile in four-lotterdale.

[02:43:49.100 --> 02:43:51.180]
Sounds like he's got the phone in his rectum.

[02:43:51.400 --> 02:43:52.220]
Okay sorry about that.

[02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:55.980]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line.

[02:43:57.480 --> 02:43:58.840]
Let's try Kendall hello.

[02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:00.660]
Hi Neil how are you okay sir.

[02:44:01.100 --> 02:44:04.060]
I have to agree if you backstreet boys are much cuter but instinct.

[02:44:04.340 --> 02:44:05.460]
I think they were cuter.

[02:44:06.020 --> 02:44:06.680]
Well I think they are.

[02:44:06.820 --> 02:44:07.640]
Who cares if they're cute.

[02:44:08.060 --> 02:44:11.080]
I know but instinct they have they just don't have a look you know.

[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:12.960]
They suck they can't sing.

[02:44:13.180 --> 02:44:16.900]
I know okay sweetheart they can't sing but you up and call us out when you do.

[02:44:17.500 --> 02:44:21.400]
Okay two calls left on the board and we got 14 minutes to kill I guess I can play 98 degrees

[02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:22.120]
a couple of times.

[02:44:23.460 --> 02:44:29.060]
I do think I might 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 kind of bring the shortaway screech

[02:44:29.060 --> 02:44:29.500]
in halt.

[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:32.020]
Here's Miami hello.

[02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:33.000]
Neil.

[02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:33.560]
Yes sir.

[02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:34.480]
Hey how you doing okay.

[02:44:34.880 --> 02:44:38.440]
That was the backstreet boy that you played a couple segments ago right.

[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:38.800]
Yes.

[02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:42.820]
I can't believe I'm saying this but I actually like that song I thought it was pretty good.

[02:44:42.940 --> 02:44:44.160]
Larger than life yeah it's a good song.

[02:44:44.320 --> 02:44:45.720]
You know the video is real good.

[02:44:45.900 --> 02:44:50.120]
Well the problem I have with groups like them and like especially boys to men.

[02:44:50.820 --> 02:44:52.060]
Who the hell likes boys to men.

[02:44:52.060 --> 02:44:57.480]
I don't know so like 98 degrees I can't stand these sappy stoop of love balance that they do

[02:44:57.480 --> 02:44:57.700]
there.

[02:44:57.960 --> 02:44:58.040]
Yeah.

[02:44:58.100 --> 02:45:02.660]
Like those melodramatic ones where they look at each other and they make the faces you know it's

[02:45:02.660 --> 02:45:04.220]
the most contrived crap I've ever heard.

[02:45:04.260 --> 02:45:07.560]
I don't know how anybody can not like I do any red blood at the head of a sexual guy

[02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:11.520]
wouldn't like I do because the Dorito girl is in there like with her big gigantic melons hanging

[02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:11.740]
out.

[02:45:12.100 --> 02:45:13.560]
But there's something in there for everybody.

[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:15.460]
I haven't seen a video that I believe in.

[02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:15.860]
That's you.

[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:20.440]
I would be singing a different tune believe me even George loves that video he could do

[02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:22.840]
it out the music part but he likes the video trust me.

[02:45:22.940 --> 02:45:29.280]
Okay and also about the spots on that what videos are supposed to be for a little bit tit

[02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:30.320]
alighting if I can say that.

[02:45:30.780 --> 02:45:31.080]
Exactly.

[02:45:32.060 --> 02:45:36.600]
About the spots I agree that the spots on Hank's show are unbelievably long.

[02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:42.460]
But one of the reasons I think you're so successful is that your spots are shorter and you

[02:45:42.460 --> 02:45:43.660]
do those songs afterwards.

[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:47.480]
It's like I want to hear those spots because I don't want to miss the tune after you know what I mean.

[02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:52.100]
So maybe Hank's there playing some bits exactly after those 13 in fact if he played his cards

[02:45:52.100 --> 02:45:55.480]
right after a 13 minute break and played a couple of bits then he'd never have to say anything

[02:45:55.480 --> 02:45:56.280]
but hello and goodbye.

[02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:00.240]
Or even do the farting noises in the spot like that's great.

[02:46:00.700 --> 02:46:03.460]
I laugh when I hear that that's why I listen to your spots.

[02:46:03.900 --> 02:46:06.040]
And then don't forget about those great gun show spots.

[02:46:07.160 --> 02:46:11.840]
Exactly but you know what's the purpose when I listen to Hank's show I sit there and I

[02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:15.000]
I don't want to sit through the spots first of all I go and listen to any kind of

[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:16.840]
divita by my own butterfly and come back.

[02:46:16.980 --> 02:46:18.240]
Let's just go to the right timing yeah.

[02:46:18.260 --> 02:46:19.980]
They're doing the sports that they can help.

[02:46:20.020 --> 02:46:23.700]
In fact when they could listen to any kind of divita and MacArthur's park back to back.

[02:46:23.980 --> 02:46:28.460]
Exactly but we know I sit there like a man because I go you know what if they had competition

[02:46:28.460 --> 02:46:30.820]
they better be glad they don't have competition.

[02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:31.200]
That's right.

[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:32.620]
Where's no yeah.

[02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:36.300]
Yeah they've been lucky enough for and I hope they get their act together and realize

[02:46:36.300 --> 02:46:37.940]
that they're turning people off.

[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:38.680]
Okay.

[02:46:38.860 --> 02:46:39.680]
Alright let's see.

[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:42.460]
Well that's what happens when you step into a bucket of what he said.

[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:42.760]
Right.

[02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:43.160]

[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:46.840]
And that's Greg Reed you know he thinks he pretends he knows something because he

[02:46:46.840 --> 02:46:48.780]
lucked out here because he was able to buy everybody.

[02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:52.740]
Spending other people's money you know when you spend the uh

[02:46:52.740 --> 02:46:55.540]
easily his money and his wife's money you can buy anybody you want.

[02:46:55.960 --> 02:46:58.260]
The only problem is did he spend the money wisely?

[02:46:58.440 --> 02:46:58.560]
No.

[02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:02.680]
Because he gave the money to Wayne and John Henry enormous millions of dollars

[02:47:02.680 --> 02:47:06.340]
that I said are choking his place unbelievably they're gagging on it.

[02:47:06.480 --> 02:47:07.600]
They're gagging on it.

[02:47:07.740 --> 02:47:11.100]
This place is building more than any station in the market by far.

[02:47:11.320 --> 02:47:14.520]
We're building millions and millions and millions and they and still we're just fearless.

[02:47:14.780 --> 02:47:17.520]
That's why when it comes payday we got to see if the little squiggles are in the

[02:47:17.520 --> 02:47:20.300]
bottom of the check to see if it's okay to take it to the bank or not.

[02:47:20.940 --> 02:47:24.260]
That's why George is still waiting for his bonus from the spring rating book.

[02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:26.980]
Now that we're rolling to the summer book of course it's almost over.

[02:47:26.980 --> 02:47:29.980]
He's waiting for the bonus from the spring book and so are a lot of other people.

[02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:35.700]
So let me say it again God bless Norm Kent because we wouldn't have ridden the

[02:47:35.700 --> 02:47:38.640]
and the written it in gold in platinum in my contract.

[02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:41.360]
We'd be running 85 minutes a spot an hour here

[02:47:43.180 --> 02:47:46.420]
and I would also get my bonus whenever it felt like it but you see

[02:47:46.420 --> 02:47:48.780]
the one thing let me tell you this and this is the truth.

[02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:53.320]
Mark this down okay just like Wayne like Baldi told you only in this case it's the truth.

[02:47:54.980 --> 02:48:01.640]
The only way that you can get these people to do anything is if you have it written in

[02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:06.700]
in platinum in pure platinum it's the only way.

[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:11.760]
If it isn't written down if you can't threaten them with a lawsuit and hold it over them legally

[02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:14.980]
they'll just look at you and like oh well we'll get around it.

[02:48:15.220 --> 02:48:19.360]
We'll buy a lot because that's their number one expertise the area of expert is lying.

[02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:22.900]
They lie like champions and why the hell not practice makes perfect.

[02:48:23.740 --> 02:48:26.460]
And then if you say that they're a bunch of liars they get a real uptight and

[02:48:26.460 --> 02:48:31.140]
psychotic and oh they're indignant how dare you say it like it is.
