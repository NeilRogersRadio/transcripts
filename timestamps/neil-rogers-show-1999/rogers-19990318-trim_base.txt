[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:08.120]
4.2560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.020]
The Neil called 5.670560 toll free for date and brown.

[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.160]
Or pound 5.60 on yourself.

[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.740]
Are you?

[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.100]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show do not necessarily

[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.160]
reflect those of WQAM easily read acquisition or the beastly broadcast group.

[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.740]
No, no.

[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.380]
Neil Rogers on sports radio 5.60 QAM.

[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.460]
And you've been to several places for spring train.

[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.940]
I know, but I remember I go back a long way to when the Yankees first came down here and

[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.800]
they had trained all those years in St. Petersburg and what a culture shock it was for them to leave

[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.940]
St. Petersburg and come to Fort Lauderdale with it, which at that time was where spring

[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.860]
break was happening.

[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.320]
You know, in St. Petersburg, you know what was happening there, Will, because you've been

[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.680]
at spring training in that city, there was nothing there, right?

[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.240]
Well, I was in poor Charlotte for five years.

[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.420]
When you were with the, did you ever go to St. Petersburg?

[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.400]
Nope.

[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.060]
For spring training, never did?

[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.020]
Nope, nope.

[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.820]
Nine years before that I was in Arizona.

[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.660]
Yeah.

[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.500]
Right, with the Giants.

[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.340]
Yeah, how is it coming over to the American League?

[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.380]
You looking forward to it?

[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.260]
I've been in the American League for five years now.

[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.000]
Yeah.

[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.680]
So, I'm not unfamiliar with it.

[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.440]
I'm looking forward to just starting with a new teenager.

[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.600]
That's incredible to me.

[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.240]
Incredible, what an embarrassment.

[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.040]
What a joke.

[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.540]
Who is this?

[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.240]

[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.700]
I'm not a drunk.

[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.160]
I'm a wrestling match.

[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.020]
With big, smooth men, with sweaty cracks.

[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.720]
They were tried to grab each other's ass.

[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.480]
Where we know nothing more than the tiny g-strap.

[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.300]
But when they rang the bell and the match was over,

[00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.420]
I couldn't help but notice I had a big phone.

[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.120]
I want to be a wrestler.

[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.040]
A wrestler.

[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.700]
Yes.

[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.440]
And have a man's crotch wrapped around my mouth.

[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.840]
Yeah.

[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.520]
I want to be a wrestler.

[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.520]
OK.

[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.940]
You don't mind lacing someone's balls in your mouth.

[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.180]
I know that white sleeves can be messy and too melty.

[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.060]
That's why they like to rub that KY on their belly.

[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.200]
All right.

[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.940]
I want to be a wrestler.

[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.980]
And retaining more arms just like you.

[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.200]
I want to be a wrestler.

[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.520]
And maybe run for governor too.

[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.880]
As long as they attract the crowd, I don't mind going down.

[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.080]
Robby sees his innocent or locked with some clumsy queers.

[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.440]
Oh, speaking of that, by the way.

[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.900]
So Greg Rieg, we were talking about his horrible haircut yesterday.

[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.480]
Remember, he and his family went to Italy.

[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.640]
And they were very enchanted with the whole deal over there.

[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.520]
He said in one of the museums in Florence, he saw a picture of Mark Coney.

[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.940]
And he figured since Mark Coney was a great radio pioneer in Italy.

[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.340]
And since he pretends to be a radio guy in the Soviet, he wanted to emulate Mark Coney.

[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.880]
And Mark Coney, I guess, was the first one with that silly, baggy haircut in the out of the forehead.

[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.480]
I've never seen any pictures of Mark Coney.

[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.860]
So he wanted to emulate him.

[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.020]
And he said it must have worked as soon as he walked outside.

[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.220]
There was somebody out on the street yelling.

[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.620]
Not a Coney.

[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.280]
Not a Coney.

[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.180]
He may have misunderstood.

[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.740]
Yeah, not Mark Coney.

[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.360]
Not a Coney.

[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.820]
But anyway.

[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.440]
And he's living up to his case here is.

[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.840]
So anyway, we'll forget about Greg's haircut.

[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.740]
I think we may have a desk for a duck coming.

[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.160]
We got the catalog in there that he's looking through either.

[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.320]
I'm going to buy one or we got somebody might want to donate one.

[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.920]
Maybe we'll get the details on it.

[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.340]
See the problem is we got the different facts machines for different shows.

[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.700]
Nobody's got the right numbers.

[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.760]
It's all screwed up.

[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.680]
Good news today, by the way.

[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.820]
Besides the fact we got a Marlon's exhibition game at 1250.

[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.960]
We got a Marlon's exhibition game at 1250.

[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.960]

[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.940]
And I bet you there's some people let's find out right off the bat.

[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.240]
If there's anybody that's happy we got Marlon's exhibition baseball today at 1250.

[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.560]
Who are they playing today?

[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.460]
The Marlon's in the Oral.

[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.920]
That's right.

[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.040]
Where they'll be protesting again today like they were yesterday.

[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.180]
They'll all be out there outside the stadium going.

[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.580]
They're at 1250.

[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.960]
We got out.

[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.400]
Let's see.

[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.180]
QAM.

[00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.460]
Marlon's central.

[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.560]
WQAM.

[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.080]
I don't give a fly-in still at it.

[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.600]
Okay.

[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.520]
He doesn't give a fly-in crap about the Marlon.

[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.840]
It's okay.

[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.580]
What he was going to say.

[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.400]
I don't think these people want to hear no Marlon baseball.

[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.360]
Anyway, we'll get to that in a second because Barry Jenkins writes something in his comments.

[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:22.300]
It's pretty interesting that I wasn't even aware of with all this countertimes going on between the station and the Marlins and the High Pinga people.

[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.780]
WQAM.

[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.460]
Mobile and Davy.

[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.240]
Yeah.

[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.720]
No baseball.

[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.180]
Okay.

[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.660]
Thank you.

[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.120]
So anyway.

[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.840]
We got baseball at 1250, baby.

[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.960]
I don't want it or not.

[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.120]
Is there anybody wants it?

[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.360]
No.

[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.840]
Come on.

[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.900]
Is there someone out there?

[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.180]
No.

[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.420]
Huh?

[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.120]
Some real jocks differ that wants a baseball game today.

[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.340]
No.

[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.360]
The next division is game between those lowly Marlins and the Orioles that are going to Cubanolest.

[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.340]
Boy, that's a match-up.

[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.000]
That's what's called a loose-loose proposition.

[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:49.440]
All right?

[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.800]
Here's Miami.

[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:51.140]
Hello.

[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.800]
Baseball.

[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.460]
Negative.

[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.180]
Okay.

[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.340]
Negative Tourant of Baseball.

[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.700]
No.

[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.120]
Okay.

[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.240]
Just checking out.

[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.800]
Maybe I'm wrong.

[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.640]
I mean, maybe two hours and 50 minutes of this year all kind of eases them into the mood for a nice ball game.

[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.160]
You know, sit back in a couple of weenies out.

[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.020]
A couple of six packs.

[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.780]
Oh, by the way, I've got to tell you this.

[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.780]
I mean, I realize that anything can be overdone, but I still say the greatest TV spot in history.

[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.500]
I've seen it 4,000 times already, and I just pee in my pants every time I see it.

[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.580]
That Bud Light Spot.

[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:23.940]
You've got to have seen it.

[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.020]
We're the two guys who are at the counter with the groceries.

[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.440]
And she is the best.

[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.680]
She's the Madonna cashier.

[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.980]
Still short.

[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.440]
Still, she's snapping the gum.

[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.320]
Still short.

[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.520]
And the bag boy is great.

[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.640]
He's like a skinnier, skinnier Gilbert without the glasses.

[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.220]
Paper or plastic?

[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.740]
That's funny.

[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.340]
I'm talking.

[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.500]
It's just the best in history.

[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.800]
What are all these calls here?

[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.440]
Here's Kendall.

[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.740]
Hello.

[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.780]
Just play the baseball spots.

[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.980]
That's a good idea.

[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.860]
There you go.

[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.820]
I'll find him up.

[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.420]
There's a new general manager right there.

[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.180]
Just play the spots that would run into baseball game if we had any.

[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.500]
Of course, we've got our spots running in there and not our sponsors in too.

[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.520]
I have to talk about bait and switch.

[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.560]
I just want to say one thing.

[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.340]
I don't want to get involved because we can't talk about that lawsuit that's going on.

[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.200]
So I don't want to stick my nose into it.

[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.360]
But boy, for this place to be talking about bait and switch.

[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.100]
I mean, talk about the pot calling the kettle a peice.

[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.260]
Bait and switch.

[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.760]
Just like Jeff Cohen, wait till he finds out he may have had a spot that ran in the ballgame.

[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.960]
He's not going to put up with that.

[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.760]
He may not even bring us any food around 12-30 today.

[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.320]
Yeah, Jeff Cohen's got that Matsu pizza and Matsu lasagna in time for pay softly.

[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.040]
And this year, as I recall, I asked you, that was damn good stuff.

[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.300]
And since my doctor's coming around to draw lots and lots of blood today.

[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.800]
Hey, doctor, do a little.

[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.900]
I hope you take all the blood you want, sweetheart.

[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.220]
I want air retests that's ever been invented just to assure me that I'm still alive, especially when you work here.

[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.600]
Here's Fort Myers.

[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:48.940]
Hello.

[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.180]
Heal rules, baseball facts.

[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.140]
Okay, thank you.

[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.060]
Even on the West Coast, I hate the Marlins.

[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:54.460]
Oh!

[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.160]
You like that?

[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.300]
I don't want to make John Henry feel bad.

[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.700]
But they don't, they're not into this crap.

[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.660]
Oh, but let me give you one before we go on.

[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.900]
Let me give you a little ray of hope.

[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.840]
Because it says, well, Bob Rubin and Barry Jackass conspired to write this piece in the here old this morning.

[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.500]
No radio deal yet.

[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:12.860]
Oh!

[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:18.780]
Let's say, less than three weeks before their regular season opener, the Marlins indicated they're still unsure if they'll return to QA in this season.

[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.260]
We got our fingers crossed, baby.

[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.420]
In fact, maybe some of the underlings here might actually be able to get a pay raise someday.

[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.580]
Anyway, the Marlins are worried that QA might not pay its entire rights fee this year.

[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.980]
Discussions continue, but that was from between the sides.

[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:41.560]
WQM beginning in the third year of a five year, $15 million deal allegedly withheld $2 million of its rights fees last year.

[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:47.160]
And it's filed a lawsuit against the Marlins alleging fraud in connection with the dismantling of the World Series Championship team.

[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:55.060]
If the Marlins do not return to QAM, if they should by some chance not return to QAM, they move to an FM station.

[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.880]
Now, what FM station do you think wants to lose some money?

[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.460]
Huh? I wonder what they're talking about.

[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.720]
Do you think there's any FM station in the market that's interested in losing a lot of money?

[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:04.960]
No.

[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.800]
On that? No.

[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.500]
Oh, okay. Maybe they're coasts.

[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.860]
Huh? They don't? No.

[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.400]
Love 94? No.

[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.320]
KPX? No. No. No chance. They're too smart.

[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.360]
Kiss? No. No. No. No. No. No.

[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.320]
What am I leaving on?

[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.420]
RMS? No. No.

[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.980]
Big? No. No. Small? No.

[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.140]
Tall? No. Short? No.

[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:36.500]
I'm trying to think of an FM station that would pick up the guy named Marlins game that's in the market to lose about three or four million dollars this year.

[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:44.440]
Nine minutes pet. There's a Joe Castello by the way the star of our new big auto sport shows debuting this Saturday morning between six and seven here on QAM.

[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.380]
Motor sports. I'm plugging a hell out of a man. Don't bitch your me out of no.

[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.600]
But they'll be calling they love that stuff. You know, especially Saturday morning. They're just coming in those shot kickers man.

[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.520]
My third strike folks.

[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:03.820]
Oh, black.

[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.400]

[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:08.580]
What?

[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.020]
Where you can sing it in a song.

[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.080]
Where you can smoke it in a bomb.

[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.120]
Where you can find five.

[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.120]
Are you?

[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.260]
I listen to the names of the names.

[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.160]
Okay.

[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.860]
Oh.

[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.600]
Oh, we're fine.

[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.780]
Let's go to fight.

[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.940]
Let's go to fight.

[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.140]
Let's go to fight.

[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.400]
God.

[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.440]
Let's go to fight.

[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.720]
Everybody's so loud.

[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.620]
Yeah.

[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:16.960]
Yeah.

[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:26.940]
And

[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.220]
the

[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:42.380]
the

[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:44.800]
oh

[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.000]
let's

[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.180]
yes

[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:48.520]
no

[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.280]
let's

[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:50.580]
let's

[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:53.960]
let's

[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.240]
let's

[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.160]
let's see

[00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:08.140]
let me just tell you right now any country that makes smoking a marijuana

[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.220]
illegal and in like enforces all those

[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.160]
can never be a great country could possibly know yeah i mean like fan

[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.480]
covert are walking around the streets they got a big one rolled up in

[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.580]
their puts and a uh... joint too

[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.400]
anyway potgain some support there it is right on the front page of the

[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.420]
newspapers today uh... i'm telling you this has been quite a banner day in

[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.280]
the uh... news of the business to be able to have any news on the station but

[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:29.720]
nevertheless

[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.900]
a government commission panels finding on the medical use of marijuana are

[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.500]
certain to intensify the debate over its benefits to people with aids in

[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.540]
cancer who do not respond to other therapies

[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.840]
the active ingredients in meridio we need a period of useful for treating pain

[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.540]
nausea and severe weight loss associated with aids according to a new study

[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.180]
commission by the government that's intensifying the debate over where the

[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.080]
doctors should be permitted to prescribe the drug

[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.420]
the report the most comprehensive annualization to date of the medical literature

[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.600]
about meridio we need said there was no evidence that giving the drug to sick

[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.260]
people would increase illicit use in the general population

[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.280]
especially since almost everybody smoking in any way

[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.240]
nor is marijuana a gateway drug that prana here you go

[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.320]
here you go this is not from uh... me some pervert on a radio

[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.020]
that hangs out in the Amsterdam where they're all spoken in the doing hash and

[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.040]
whatever they're doing not for me nor this is from a bunch of doctors

[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:24.300]
nor is marijuana a gateway drug that prompts patients to use harder drug

[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.440]
such as cocaine and heroin the study said

[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.180]
how do you like that

[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.400]
the authors of the study of panel of eleven independent experts at the

[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.140]
institute of medicine a branch of the national academy of sciences

[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.800]
caution that the benefits of smoking marijuana were limited because the

[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.200]
smoke itself is so toxic so in other words you can get lung cancer from it

[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.000]
you can get lung cancer from smoking anything including a lot of stuff that's

[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.880]
illegal not to mention cigarettes and

[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.660]
okay i won't say that

[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:56.640]
okay

[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.840]
how do you like that

[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.920]
as this country desperately reaching just tired to get its testicles and

[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.360]
its tentacles out of the stone age reaching out for a little bit of maturity

[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.460]
like i said once the last time you read about somebody that held up a seven

[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.900]
eleven to get money to buy pot

[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.460]

[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.020]
support their habits they're breaking into homes and uh... killing people

[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.120]

not that you know that old slogan it's not important that you succeed but

[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.360]
that your former assoll employers fail

[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.700]
with cash running short all i can't could sell stations and there's a picture of

[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.780]
the anxious idiotic buddy but taxing

[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.500]
courses network is worth the let's see between one point five one point nine

[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.500]

[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.400]
doing more statues and monuments to him and what a great guy he is and never

[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.960]
stole a freight train about about a beep and all this other bullcrap

[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.540]
by the way nice panties game last night

oh those two teams to get together it is not bad and the leaves

[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.280]
but anyway

[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.720]
a liquid liquidity squeeze is never a pretty side particularly for a man like

[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.880]
low old w bud buddy bud paxson who insisted just five

[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.200]
months ago that he needed no contingency plan for his past tv network

[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.720]
launched dog a thirty first with a family friendly programming and paxson's

[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.160]
conviction that god have given him a knot on the business plan did god give him a

[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.820]
knot no a wink at a nod no no god set up your ass you phony bastard

[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.020]
ninety eight paxson which owns seventy two stations along with the network

[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:41.020]
is selling some assets prompting speculative reports that it might

[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:44.120]
entertain suitors for the whole company see this is what happens

[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.500]
just like he did with the radio thing screwed up all radio stations and he buys

[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.540]
this and he buys that because he got all that money from the home

[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.940]
schlock network which made him very dangerous like i told you and then he

[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.760]
buys up a whole bunch of stuff screws it all up reduces the value which is why

[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.820]
his stock is down to like eight or nine dollars a share it was uh... you know

[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.880]
fifteen sixteen then it was eleven or twelve when we left over there and

[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.320]
i would take her nine bucks a share it's in the toilet

and then he just okay well i give up on i'll sell everything

[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.180]
and then we'll find some other play to it to play with and screw up a bunch of

[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.880]
other people's lives in the process see wouldn't make any difference i don't

[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.580]
mind that rich people have their play toys if it didn't involve people

[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.940]
if it didn't involve this business especially and a lot of good people and

[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.820]

The man for millions and if he's gone to work for taxes. No.

[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.540]
We fight waiting for hair.

[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.260]
You not think that it's a bummer. Yes.

[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:09.080]
And down Henry's gone. Are you?

[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.140]
Say goodbye to Aaron's and the suburbs. They hide around and run.

[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:14.420]
No.

[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.240]
And that's a matter of fact.

[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.640]
They're gone over for taxes.

[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.980]
But he'll be changing his act.

He wants to change the station's letters.

[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.580]
The WGOT now will work for taxes.

[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.740]
Keep the brand new car.

[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.400]

Taxis. Taxis. Make a sign of the drop.

And of course for Wayne. Don't be too talk.

[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.740]
Start buying a lot more at those concession stands. We've got three home games for the Panthers next week.

[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.200]
Better start buying up a lot more concessions because that republic stock is in the toilet.

[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.520]
Start helping these guys out for all the good things they've done for us.

[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:27.320]
Also anyway on the front page of both newspapers this is a very interesting resolution to the story about the arson at the new gate club which hadn't even opened up yet.

[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.800]
But opened yesterday finally the pier in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:38.440]
A man with a history of arrest for unruly protest was net when they were allegedly trying to fire bomb a gay entertainment complex in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:45.660]
Police detective sticking out the pier, a swank billured home nightclub restaurant and lounge, arrested Umberto Alvarado.

[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:55.860]
About 345 in the morning Wednesday after allegedly bicycle to the club, smacked the glass doors with a sledgehammer and tossed two gasoline field bottles inside.

[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.840]
Umberto. Say it isn't so Umberto. Is it so?

[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:00.340]
Yes.

[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:04.540]
Investigators began sticking out the club after two arson attempts their last week.

[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:13.120]
Alvarado 49 was taken to the Broward County. Jaley was charged with one kind of arson on on occupied dwelling and two counts of possession of a fire bomb.

[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.920]
Investigators say they don't know what motivated Alvarado and tried to set the fire but you can guess for yourself.

[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:25.320]
His first arrest Wednesday was not his arrest Wednesday was not his first one in the law in 1991.

[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:35.580]
It was arrested for allegedly calling and threatening playboy magazine executives demanding they apologize for women of Cuba a pictorial that featured scataly clothe Cuban women.

[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:43.300]
He was arrested again in 1993 after jumping out of federal guard's car during a Cuban protest in Miami.

[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:54.700]
And police said his fingerprints were found near the club at 3333 Northeast 32nd Avenue after the first arson attempt last week though he was not charged in that incident.

[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.700]
Alvarado used to train militant exiles for Alpha 66.

[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:08.140]
His 1991 arrest were allegedly threatening Christie Hepner whose father started playboy magazine because of the women of Cuba pictorial.

[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:13.600]
It was accused of violating the Hobbs Act which protects commercial enterprises from extortion and physical violence.

[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.100]
Don't confuse him with American law, okay?

[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.220]
No speak any English.

[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:24.440]
And in 1993 in demonstration protesting US plans to light a Cuban pilot for diverting a plane full of defectors to Miami.

[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:30.460]
Agent arrested Alvarado after he climbed the top of government car jumping up and down waving a Cuban flag.

[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.040]
Huh.

[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:40.160]
Now anti-cuba game group protest outside stadium yesterday at Fort Lauderdale Stadium.

[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:47.200]
A group of about a hundred held a protest outside the box office last night before the Marlon Zoriel's game.

[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:52.240]
They were protesting your oath plan visit the Cuba for exhibition game with the Cuban national theme in March 20th.

[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:54.120]
I think it was George Faber gas.

[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.600]
The hangcat on yesterday going lucky lucky and you're talking trash talking.

[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.980]
Oh yes, we're very much against this because you know people are going to think and cast your way.

[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.460]
Well, everybody there's nobody in the world.

[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.760]
There's no way cast your ways, okay?

[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.400]
There's not one person that doesn't know that he's a brutal dictator ruthless.

[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.500]
People get killed.

[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.320]
People go to jail.

[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.540]
People can't express an opinion.

[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.940]
People are living in squalor.

[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.260]
Everybody knows that, right?

[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.020]
Okay.

[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.420]
They're not going to go there to have sex with them.

[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.560]
They're not going to go there to dance the tango with them.

[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.580]
They're not going to go there and embrace him.

[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.280]
They're going to play a baseball game.

[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:29.000]
Unlike the Pope who sat up there on the same stage with him and dignified him.

[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.380]
Like every other terrorist in the world like Eric Farton, every other one that the Pope has always loved.

[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.480]
And nobody said a word about that.

[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.140]
I didn't see anybody protesting the Pope's visit to Cuba.

[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:46.040]
And here we're talking about a goddamn ball game just like they played you know ping pong with a Chinese back before it was fashionable.

[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.960]
And they played chess with the Russians back when they were all screaming communist to come and eat it right?

[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.100]
They're going to go play a baseball game.

[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.360]
We're talking about human beings.

[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.800]
Oh, this is Jose Alavarietta.

[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.640]
A real estate salesman from Miami chanted over a bullhorn at the game last night.

[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.300]
Cuba is run by a tyrant, a murderer, or you should not go to Cuba.

[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.480]
Rep, rebel against the owner of the orals.

[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:07.940]
Don't go.

[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:08.940]
Don't go. Don't do it.

[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:09.520]
Don't do it.

[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.800]
Mariquan, Mariquan, Mariquan.

[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:11.960]
Yeah.

[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.060]
Oh boy.

[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.320]
Wait, is there ever going to stop now?

[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.240]
Never going to stop.

[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.140]
Where's that other real good story that I was really amazed.

[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:27.160]
This is, I don't want to get you people scared that I have kids that go to school on a school bus every day.

[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.800]
I might get you nervous, but.

[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:36.720]
I mean, this story, this story, this should be on the front page of the front section, not the local section.

[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.000]
School bus driver charged with molesting kids.

[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.980]
A North-Dade school bus driver already on probation for misdemeanor child abuse.

[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.880]
Was charged Wednesday with molesting four of his passengers.

[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:58.240]
He sometimes used candy to coax sexual favors from children ranging from 7 to 11 years old North-Mondi Beach police said.

[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:00.260]
How do you like that?

[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.940]
He allegedly used candy.

[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.320]
Polarity's kid, and this guy is a driving a school bus.

[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.960]
Want a lollipop little boy?

[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.540]
We took a very dangerous pedophile off the streets tonight to North-Mondi Beach police chief Bill Berger.

[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.560]
This guy had previously been convicted elsewhere and fell through the cracks.

[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:25.720]
Last June, Cesar Antonio Gonzales Rubio Schwartz, owner of Schwartz, was charged with loot and the severe act on a child under 12 by Mami-Dade police.

[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:32.320]
He is not listed among the state sexual predators, however, because he negotiated a guilty plea to a lesser charge of misdemeanor child abuse.

[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.640]
But nevertheless, here's a guy with a record of misdemeanor child abuse.

[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.380]
He's driving a school bus with kids on it.

[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:45.160]
He was arrested 315 pm Wednesday in the parking lot behind the North-Mondi Beach Commerce Center.

[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:50.280]
He was trying to bribe a boy to performing a sexual favor for him with a gallon-sized bag of candy.

[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.900]
Want a lollipop little boy?

[00:29:52.360 --> 00:30:01.480]
Gonzales Rubio was charged with four counts of sexual battery on a child under 12 years of age, four counts of loot and the severe behavior, two counts of exposure and one kind of witness tampering.

[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.060]
Each sexual battery charge carries up to a life sentence, by the way.

[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:13.360]
The suspect owns and drives for Cesar's bus service, which is shuttle children to and from North-Aid public elementary schools for four years.

[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.560]
And it goes on and on and yada yada, it's said and so on.

[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.580]
Here's a guy that's unbelievable.

[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.240]
I don't want to get you nervous about the people that drive it.

[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.400]
I mean, forget about the fact that most of them can't drive. They couldn't drive their finger up their ass.

[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.020]
Okay, you've seen the way they drive these school buses, unbelievably badly.

[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:38.220]
But I mean, here's a guy with a record of misdemeanor child abuse on his rap sheet and he's out there driving a school bus with somebody's kids on it.

[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:39.520]
Maybe yours.

[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:41.900]
Huh, what a surprise.

[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:47.880]
21 before 11 at 560 WQM, anybody interested in that ballgame coming up 1250?

[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.120]
No.

[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.420]
Marlins and the Orioles, come on, let's hear it.

[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.620]
Freedom and say cheese.

[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.560]
One in seven Americans suffers from a terrible affliction.

[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:02.020]
And while others find it funny, for those who have it, it's no laughing matter.

[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.160]
It's called frequent burping syndrome.

[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.280]
It's terrible.

[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:12.180]
I'll be on a safe or a business meeting and...

[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.340]
Excuse me.

[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.880]
See what happened?

[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.760]
Frequent burping syndrome.

[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.520]
It can ruin your life.

[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.260]
But it doesn't have to.

[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.440]
Now there's a clinic that can help.

[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.060]
Trained specialists.

[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.920]
Sensitive to the needs of compulsive belchers.

[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.360]
A special place known as burp-inders.

[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.980]
Gosh, burp-inders saved my life.

[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.440]
But Joanne and I were in love.

[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.540]
I really wanted to ask for it and marry me.

[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:41.920]
But I just knew that when the moment of proof came, I'd let out with a big rip.

[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.840]
No.

[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.600]
Burp-inders.

[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:53.820]
No shame, no guilt, no more tummy rumbling smelly belches, no more stopping in mid-sittance

[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.020]
to unblock a big cheesy blaster.

[00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.620]
Just caring professionals and the help you need.

[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.180]
Don't wait. Here's the number to call.

[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.880]
Five five five two eight seven seven.

[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.560]
That's five five five five.

[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:10.820]
Burp-inders.

[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.340]
Call today and stop being so close.

[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.540]
1045 at five sixty W.

[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.680]
To QM Happy Thursday too.

[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.340]
Yeah, we got that Marlon game coming up today.

[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.700]
So far we haven't had one person.

[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.740]
You know, this presents a lot of real problems.

[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.020]
Certainly for us here on this show.

[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.980]
This is the by far highest rated show on this radio station.

[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.100]
I mean, the sports third shows they're doing okay.

[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.140]
But we're kicking very serious ass and continue to now 14 months in this project.

[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.480]
And we get bumped out of here.

[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.760]
I mean, two days in a row.

[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:38.620]
And here we are.

[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.040]
You know, we had a great month in January knock on wood.

[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:41.480]
Right?

[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.560]
What month was it?

[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.880]
Whatever the last month in February.

[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:46.620]
That was January.

[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.540]
We had a great first month of the winter book.

[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.120]
There's bonus money right now.

[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:54.260]
That there's a lot of pride and ego and grab right now.

[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.560]
And now we get cut down to two hour and 15 minutes show.

[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.220]
And we put in everything that's so far.

[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.660]
There's not one person even as forced.

[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:03.480]
There's no one here.

[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.800]
Do they want to hear it?

[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:04.960]
No.

[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.800]
So we want to hear from these people today.

[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:11.060]
If there's anybody out there what they think about this small and exhibition is getting right here in the middle of the day.

[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.720]
No, sir, this is a very, this is unacceptable.

[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.220]
I mean, maybe once in a while like a Friday is good.

[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.640]
You know, it gives me a long weekend to get out and hear a little bit earlier.

[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.280]
You hop a plane, you get out of town.

[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.580]
So you take me anywhere but here, you know, that's fine.

[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.160]
But Thursday and Friday back to back.

[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:29.540]
Oi!

[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.020]
Being interrupted twice.

[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.640]
They're picking, they're so pissed off.

[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.660]
They're not picketing against the, the oil's going to Cuba.

[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.640]
They're picking against the Marlins staying in town.

[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.700]
That's what they're pissed off about.

[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.340]
That's right.

[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.300]
They just don't speak at the same language.

[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.840]
That's what all those crazy Cubans are speaking about.

[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.820]
They're not saying go to hell for the others.

[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.340]
They're saying to go to hell, uh, Marlins.

[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.240]
After what you pulled on us last year.

[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.740]
And we don't care for any soldatee.

[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:50.440]
We don't give a crap.

[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.100]
Not that we hold a grudge.

[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:52.740]
Do we hold a grudge?

[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.440]
What do we do?

[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.720]
I mean, for Amy, if I don't want to, like I said, stick my nose in any of this negotiation.

[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.460]
This delicate stuff that's going on and it is in litigation so I can't say too much.

[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.260]
But boy, if I had the opportunity, I mean, I'll guarantee they're lined up.

[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.640]
FM stations are lined up at this time to lose all that money.

[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:10.820]
No.

[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:11.940]
To put the Marlins on, right?

[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.980]
We're still trying to figure out which one do I leave out before?

[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.800]
CMQ FM, you think they want it?

[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:19.060]
No.

[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.080]
And Esponiole.

[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.760]
Again, Alice Grenada is you guys want it?

[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:21.960]
No.

[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:22.220]
Oh.

[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.320]
Any other FM's that I left out there?

[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.140]
There must be some.

[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:28.080]
Um, no.

[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:28.800]
Oh, how 105?

[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:29.600]
You guys want it?

[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:29.880]
No.

[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:30.800]
Got a couple of swear.

[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.400]
Got Cliff Lloyd.

[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.680]
I never got some shows on the team.

[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:33.740]
You want the Marlins?

[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:34.020]
No.

[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:34.580]
They don't want it.

[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:38.240]
David Ross, you want about 100 of that queer channel?

[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:39.840]
You guys want the Marlins?

[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:40.140]
No.

[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:42.400]
Come on.

[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:42.880]
Listen.

[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:46.420]
We've been able to, by the way, the good news is to show you the power of Neil continues.

[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.100]
The Collagen Man will be here today with the cooler, with the water.

[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.020]
Hot and cold, by the way.

[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.080]
One of those kind of great coolers.

[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.080]
We can get like hot water for coffee or tea or a little cup of soup or whatever you want.

[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.280]
And we'll have it right out there in the hallway and we will see.

[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.220]
We will share.

[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:02.540]
Phyllis.

[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.140]
We'll share with everybody else on this end of the building.

[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.860]
Don't be coming down the hallway for our water from the other side of the building because we don't come to that.

[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.380]
Use your own guide, Dan Water.

[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.700]
No, you know where this kind of like, like right after Greg's orifice there, you know.

[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:17.980]
After Maddick Cohen.

[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.600]
I'm our, Mark Coney is sitting in there inside this big room with his ego in a crappy haircut.

[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.500]
Right there it is like a divide of the whole kind of big turn around.

[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:25.800]

[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.540]
And then you see all the new paint on the wall.

[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.540]
Same crappy old carpet.

[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.260]
Never less.

[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.020]
You're on that side.

[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:33.800]
Stay over there.

[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.540]
We do like Miriam.

[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.400]
She comes up with the checks.

[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.120]
Miriam, you can have all the water you want sweetheart.

[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.460]
But other than that, stay out.

[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.120]
We shout out, put a big sign up there at the end of the hall.

[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:42.420]
Okay.

[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:44.440]
Water Steelers, stay out.

[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:47.440]
Here's Coral Springs.

[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:47.780]
Hello.

[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:49.260]
Yes sir.

[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:49.960]
Okay.

[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.500]
I don't know if you got a chance to open the first team this morning.

[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.820]
I don't listen to the first team now.

[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:55.260]
Okay.

[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:56.580]
Well I had the GM on today.

[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:57.500]
GM of what?

[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.180]
For the Panthers.

[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.340]
He gave a new, uh, then what did he share?

[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:06.680]
He said he gave a new spin on what Robbie is going to be for the team.

[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.200]
Uh huh.

[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:12.560]
And he said that we expected too much out of him initially and he's not going to be a 40 gold score.

[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.140]
Uh huh.

[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:17.960]
But if we can get 20 golds out of him a year and some great defense, we expect him to be a second third one.

[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:18.780]
Oh yeah.

[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.840]
Who's going to be the, who's going to be the first blind center?

[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:21.480]
I don't know.

[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:21.960]
Big right.

[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.780]
Big circle's cause law.

[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.380]
The guy is a minus five.

[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:25.780]
Yeah.

[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:26.940]
How's he playing great defense?

[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.400]
He's not playing great periods.

[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:34.160]
And you notice by the way that it was BM who set the, uh, the need of our upper all these booze with his crying in the media there, uh,

[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:34.980]
a week or two ago.

[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.400]
About how all, you know, the fans, uh, and the media and everybody else.

[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.260]
Well guess what?

[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.860]
He's getting paid about two and a half million a year, whatever it is.

[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.440]
This is a six year of them telling us that he's going to become, uh, Mr. Hotshot.

[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.440]
And this is breakout year.

[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:48.160]
Is he breaking it?

[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:48.500]
Yes.

[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.040]
No, he's breaking our hearts is what he's breaking.

[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.200]
Same old propaganda from the organization.

[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:58.080]
They got their ass pasted there in San Jose and guess what?

[00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:59.720]
They're right back at the 500 again.

[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:04.240]
And with the Bruins, uh, Kreme and the Leafs there in Toronto last night, which the Leafs are going through there.

[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.520]
You know, every team goes through it.

[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.420]
I was going through it.

[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:10.820]
Going through a low, going through a coma.

[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.460]
So Boston now ages three points ahead.

[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:14.960]
And the Panthers are right back at what they are.

[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.520]
A 25, a 500 team.

[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:18.880]
25 and 25 with a million crappy ties.

[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.060]
And Burrain may come back next week.

[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.460]
They're saying, believe me, if he does it, you can forget to play us.

[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:29.220]
Because without him, this is just a real, real, seriously mediocre team.

[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:29.980]
But nobody cares.

[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:30.460]
And that's good.

[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:36.340]
56670560.560 on the AT&T wireless line, whatever it is.

[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.100]
Here's a mobile and tavernier.

[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:38.340]
Hello.

[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.700]
Good morning, Dale.

[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:40.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:41.840]
I got a couple of things.

[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.300]
First of all, the Marlins on the radio.

[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:44.640]
Yes.

[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:52.000]
I haven't listened to them since you commentated a first 15 minutes of the first exhibition game.

[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.300]
That was entertaining.

[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.360]
Other than that, I couldn't listen to them.

[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:55.680]
Yeah.

[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.940]
But that's beside the point.

[00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.580]
Have you heard anything about it?

[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.000]
It was on Channel 7 last night.

[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:01.260]
No.

[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.660]
The Pope has got out a new CD.

[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.240]
Yeah, he's got a CD's on.

[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:05.420]

[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.080]
He's got a music video.

[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.720]
And I think they'll be pumping that out.

[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.220]
The video he's doing the Macarena in one of them, that's my favorite.

[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:12.080]
I was a man.

[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.180]
He's got his wooden azale gore.

[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.600]
He really moves with that flowing gown on.

[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.240]
I don't know who the drummer is on the CD either.

[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.100]
I think it's Joey Reynolds.

[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:20.500]
Yeah.

[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.760]
Dustin, time off from Erosmith.

[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.700]
Is that Paxton Nightwork?

[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:25.720]
Is that a Paxton deal?

[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.040]
Of course.

[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.520]
I caught that just channel surfing.

[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:36.700]
And they were saying that if you want to have no more home of gay or this or that or that on Earth, turn into Paxton.

[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.240]
That's right.

[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.880]
You don't want to have any perverted stuff.

[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:39.840]
You don't want to have any Jews.

[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.260]
You don't want to have any Godless crap.

[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:44.000]
Turn on and watch Dr. Quinn Medicine woman.

[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:44.420]
That's right.

[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.860]
Well, 24 hours a day.

[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:46.780]
Thanks for them, Seth.

[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:47.740]
And they're losing their ass.

[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.920]
I guess he lost God's number.

[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.380]
That must have been an okay, great day, sir.

[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:51.800]
Butchup.

[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.300]
I guess he lost Buddy Buds number 5, 6, 7.

[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:54.540]
Come on.

[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:55.460]
We want to hear about this.

[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.160]
This is serious.

[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:57.080]
Okay. They're listening.

[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.260]
They're paying attention to this.

[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.880]
If you want to hear, there was more exhibition games on here.

[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.860]
It's only the 18th of March.

[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.580]
We got almost half of the month left with this crap.

[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.640]
You do realize that, don't you?

[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.480]
We still got a half a month of these garbage exhibition games on.

[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.560]
And nobody cares about it.

[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.800]
In fact, it's a good thing that the Cubans are down there protesting because that's the only action going on.

[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:16.940]
No, that's true.

[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.520]
At least that's a little bit of excitement.

[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.600]
You know, maybe the same old tired song, but nevertheless, it's better than no song at all.

[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.760]
Somebody at least pretends to be excited about baseball in this town.

[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:31.180]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on a prestigious AT&T wireless line.

[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.300]
Short show today, 1250, we've had movies right here.

[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.960]
To make way for that big Marlon's Orioles game.

[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.040]
Any interest at all?

[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:38.420]
No.

[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.400]
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello.

[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.680]
Hey, Neil. What's going on?

[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.240]
How you doing, sir?

[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.400]
Listen, I'll tell you something.

[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:46.060]
It's good that the Panthers on the West Coast would off the sea as much.

[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:46.700]
Yeah.

[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.140]
You know, because you know, you fall asleep at 11 o'clock.

[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.180]
They're losing four and nothing.

[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.600]
But you know, you wake up, they lose four, two.

[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.720]
They made a comeback, but not quite enough.

[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:55.060]

[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:55.880]
Great.

[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.820]
Hey, listen, a couple other things I want to touch base so you ought to give you more.

[00:39:58.820 --> 00:39:58.960]
I'd like to give you more.

[00:39:59.240 --> 00:39:59.740]
Chronic's to know.

[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:00.800]
What's the difference if I'm crying?

[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.500]
It is. Uh-huh.

[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.760]
It's not like a real-cut like either.

[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.160]
Well, I can't even tell them apart anymore.

[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.300]
Is that an Andy or a match?

[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.340]
I can't even tell them apart.

[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:07.880]
I mean, that was Andy.

[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:08.800]
That was that jackass.

[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:12.920]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on a AT&T wireless line.

[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.640]
Here's the Fort Lauderdale.

[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:15.840]
Hello.

[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.100]
Fort Lauderdale.

[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.200]
Neil?

[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:20.800]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.680]
Hey, I just graduated programming school.

[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.960]
How about we put the Marlin games on Take the Lay?

[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.220]
Yeah, that sounds good.

[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:27.760]
How's that?

[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:28.260]
Uh-huh.

[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.180]
About 11 p.m.

[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.160]
How about two in the morning would be good instead of the feral on the road?

[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.160]
Whatever we carry overnight.

[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.400]
JT and the abrik.

[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.300]
Could you imagine anyone actually listening to-

[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:37.480]
No.

[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:37.920]
No.

[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.560]
I mean, even-

[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:40.440]
It's costing it's-

[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.860]
Now, see, I will speak up against.

[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.360]
I know that Hank, I found out this week.

[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.320]
I thought that Hank was, you know, a really, uh-

[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:45.900]
Maybe brought him up.

[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.220]
I'm not a fucking, but he's just a, uh-

[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:47.720]
Cory, we, uh-

[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.080]
Corporate Budlaker I found out this week on this supported bank.

[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:52.000]
I loved that beginning of the show at Hank Glossier.

[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.040]
I was listening to that.

[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.700]
Oh, so when are you going to be an American League?

[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:55.520]
That, that was so.

[00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:55.980]
Hello, Hank.

[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.120]
That was amazing.

[00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.980]
I think you know, I know it was games he played in St. Petersburg.

[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:00.440]
Not.

[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:01.360]
It's weird.

[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:02.400]
Even I know that.

[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.580]
I hate World Clark like poison, but even I could have told him.

[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:05.960]
Well, he was off his feet, you know.

[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.540]
He was having a tough day.

[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.460]
And you've been to several places for spring training.

[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.440]
I know, but I remember-

[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.800]
I go back a long way to the-

[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.280]
When the Yankees first came down here,

[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:17.060]
and they had trained all those years in St. Petersburg,

[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:20.560]
and what a culture shock it was for them to leave St. Petersburg,

[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:25.160]
and come to Fort Lauderdale with it, which at that time was where spring break was happening, you know.

[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.320]
In St. Petersburg, you know what was happening there, well,

[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.560]
because you've been to spring training in that city.

[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:30.600]
There was nothing there, right?

[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.200]
Well, I was in poor Charlotte for five years.

[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.420]
When you were with the-

[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:37.420]
Did you ever go to St. Petersburg?

[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:38.340]
Nope.

[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.000]
For spring training, never did?

[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:40.480]
Nope.

[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:44.740]
But nine years before that, I was in Arizona.

[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:45.600]
Yeah.

[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.520]
Right, with the Giants.

[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:51.300]
How was it coming over to the American League?

[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.380]
You looking forward to it?

[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.180]
I've been in the American League for five years now.

[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.640]
So I'm not unfamiliar with it.

[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.200]
I'm looking forward to just starting with a new feet.

[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.760]
That was funny.

[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.600]
If you say so.

[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.760]
See, God was punishing Hank yesterday.

[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.860]
That's why Hank had like a brain fart a couple of times in his interview with Will Clark,

[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.540]
punishing him for kissing management to ask here.

[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.380]
Don't do it again.

[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:16.460]
Don't do it, Hank.

[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:17.000]
I'm telling you.

[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:17.880]
Not good for it.

[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:21.800]
One guy I count on to be my ally to have a little bit of balls in this place,

[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.060]
and he, you know, he must have been off of his feet the other day.

[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.700]
And God punished him pronto.

[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.600]
Oh, God.

[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.880]
Okay, let's do a call from Miami.

[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.220]
Hello?

[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:32.900]
Miami.

[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:33.940]
How do you do this, huh?

[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:34.600]
Yeah, huh?

[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:34.860]
Yeah.

[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:35.280]
Okay.

[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:35.940]
There you go.

[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.160]
Go off to the stadium right now.

[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.120]
Okay, they're waiting for you, pal.

[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.480]
That was my decony with a faggy haircut.

[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:42.940]
Here's a mobile invoke.

[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:43.260]
Hello?

[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:44.700]
Hey, Neil.

[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:45.160]
How you doing?

[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:45.680]
Okay, sir.

[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:48.700]
Marlin's exhibition baseball.

[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:49.100]
Yeah.

[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:49.960]
Radio.

[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.220]
I rather listen to play by play of ice melt things.

[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:54.400]
Well, that's a 330.

[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:57.400]
Next, we're going to have from Macarena.

[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.360]
We're going to have the Kaplan doing odds on it.

[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:00.880]
Yeah.

[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.840]
I just don't think there's anything worse that you could put on.

[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.340]
I'm going to have to put on your station to clog up the air.

[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:09.300]
Right in the middle of the day, no less.

[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:10.300]
I mean, it is.

[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:14.320]
We're not talking about it night with anybody with a brain or either out doing something or watching something on television.

[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.180]
We're talking about right in the middle of the day.

[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.480]
This is a black hole in the radio.

[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:19.080]
Exactly.

[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.540]
I couldn't have said it better myself.

[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.200]
It's a black hole in the radio.

[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.640]
Oh, I just don't get it.

[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:28.580]
Well, thanks for your endorsement and your support of Marlin's baseball on 560 QAM.

[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:30.660]
567.

[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:32.320]
I'm looking for something.

[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.920]
There's got to be somebody out there that's looking forward to this that also listens to the show.

[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.420]
We got to have a little bit of a crossover there.

[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:37.620]
No.

[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.040]
Don't we?

[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.060]
We got any crossover?

[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:39.340]
No.

[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.040]
Us in the Marlin.

[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:40.580]
Come on.

[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:40.940]
One.

[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.100]
It's got to be one.

[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:47.160]
Got to be somebody that's sitting there with their glove in their hand.

[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:48.240]
Huh?

[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:51.120]
Rubbing it, getting ready for baseball season.

[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.080]
Oh, good article about Joe to match you and what a recluse he was.

[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.720]
Oh, what I do with that.

[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.280]
I did bring it in.

[00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.240]
I didn't bring it in.

[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:58.460]
I'm not going to.

[00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:59.260]
I hear it is.

[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:00.380]
Oh, wait until you hear this.

[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:03.520]
This is the most bizarre thing about him in Marlin Monroe.

[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:09.120]
In their sex life, it's a very strange, bizarre.

[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.800]
This is excerpts from a new book.

[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.500]
I'll get to this in just a second.

[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:14.320]
Wait until you hear this.

[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:21.780]
The Joe to Magi on nobody knew excerpts from a new book by Richard Ben Kramer is what this is.

[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.580]
Joe to Magi on his life is the name of the book.

[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:24.900]
I'll get to this after the break.

[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.200]
But it is astonishing.

[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.440]
You hear this and you're going to go.

[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:28.940]
Oh my God.

[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:29.400]
Yeah.

[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:30.600]
Deal Rodgers, huh?

[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:34.380]
Coming soon to the theater near you.

[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.180]
The super reed is Superman.

[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:41.460]
Superman 5.

[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.440]
Wow, Superman.

[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:44.580]
Superman Quig.

[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.900]
Jimmy Olsen is drowning.

[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:47.340]
Hey, here comes Superman.

[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:48.200]
Here he comes.

[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.280]
He's in a wheelchair.

[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:54.340]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:55.000]
Superman.

[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:56.340]
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:56.340]

[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:59.340]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:01.320]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:01.960]
Okay, right.

[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:02.860]
Derlin.

[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.320]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.920]
Yeah, it's a super gimmick.

[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:11.280]
Get out of here, you freak.

[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.840]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.460]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:19.140]
Nothing's happening.

[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:20.620]
Get on top.

[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:47.080]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.220]
Okay, stop and tell me the one you're just going to face today.

[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.220]
I'm going to say after 11 to 5.50 WQ, I mean, if that's going to be part of the deal,

[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:56.980]
we have to see this much as Sam every day, we're moving back to the second floor.

[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.520]
Don't take it personally unless you want to.

[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:06.700]
Okay, so anyway, this week's Newsweek magazine, in the, this, I don't know, it says they

[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:08.380]
had dinner, Jill and Marilyn were talking about.

[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.700]
They had dinner together for the purpose of publicity.

[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.620]
Her, she was still building her fame in 52.

[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.680]
By all accounts, dinner didn't go well.

[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.480]
Mostly her PR man shattered.

[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.240]
After a decent interval, the Maggio said he had to leave.

[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:20.900]
He'd catch a cab, but he offered him a ride.

[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:22.080]
He never got home that night.

[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.780]
By her account, they were terrific in bed.

[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:27.280]
The Maggio was no stranger to that playing field.

[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.300]
In fact, showgirls blondes were his specialty.

[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:34.980]
She thought his body was perfect, like Michelangelo's David, or with that, Markoni.

[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:39.240]
He thought hers was as well, as he said, one voice letter to her.

[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:39.720]
Wow.

[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.740]
But then on the next page, I keep that in mind.

[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:44.680]
Okay, she said they were terrific in bed.

[00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:48.420]
They fought, they screamed, she drank, he hit her.

[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:52.360]
In New York, Walter Winchell made sure Joe was president of Marilyn Poth for her publicity

[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.140]
photographs for the seven year itch.

[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:58.400]
It was the famous scene where the wind from the subway, great blue her screwed up, exposing

[00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.120]
everything below.

[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:03.740]
Joe was enraged as he watched the photographer snapping away with their lenses pointed

[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:04.820]
at his wife's crotch.

[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.960]
That night there was a terrible fight at the beginning of the end.

[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:12.440]
By October just 274 days after the wedding, she filed for divorce in California.

[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.420]
Once again, Joe wouldn't contest it.

[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:19.400]
But even while she was Mrs. Arthur Miller, Marilyn, according to her maid, kept the picture

[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.200]
of Joe taped inside her closet door.

[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:26.680]
Near the end of her life, as Marilyn was thanking her psychiatrist for helping her finally

[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:30.120]
to attain a real orgasm, she mused in mid-therapy.

[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:32.320]
I'd like to see Joe now and give him a real one.

[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:43.800]
While she was in actress, you know, a good one, like so many women.

[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.800]
She said they were terrific in bed, but you know, what did she know?

[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:51.780]
That's shocking.

[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.120]
Please be almost speechless.

[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.000]
Here's a mobile imponvy, chill out.

[00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:57.280]
Yes, hello.

[00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:57.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:04.300]
Yeah, I'm going to cover a st. Louis Cardinal baseball preseason.

[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.300]
Oh, how boring.

[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:06.400]
Oh, I know.

[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.940]
I have to shoot the hosts that are boring.

[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:13.820]
That's worse than listening to it on the radio.

[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.720]
I mean, but at least they're paying me.

[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.720]
Okay, listen, take some photos and have a good time.

[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.920]
Well, he sounds like he's already on the verge of a coma, doesn't he?

[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.780]
I sounded like he was well on his way to a deep sleep.

[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.320]
Here's a mobile and Kate Coral.

[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:29.540]
Hello.

[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.120]
Mobile and Kate Coral.

[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:35.480]
Going once.

[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:36.300]
Huh?

[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:36.940]
Yes, sir.

[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:37.480]
Speak to me.

[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.540]
Yes, I want to hear some about the Marlon baseball.

[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.580]
And I'd like to hear lotion in the basket.

[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.620]
You want to hear something about the Marlon baseball?

[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:44.440]
Yeah.

[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.400]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.280]
I want to find out what's going on.

[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:49.200]
Why do they suck?

[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:52.900]
Okay, there's a guy wants to hear something about why the Marlon suck.

[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:57.060]
And he says it puts the lotion in his basket or say he said put the Joe to measure when

[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.820]
the casket, I think is what he said, open line and date one and brown.

[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.260]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.660]
I mean, seriously, just even talking about this is putting me in a work coma.

[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.680]
12, 50 back to back days.

[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:12.300]
Okay, not that I'm complaining about the time off, but I think that the audience is getting

[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:12.680]
screwed.

[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:16.140]
I'm getting screwed because when the numbers come out, there should be an asterisk next

[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:16.460]
to it.

[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:21.140]
I mean, this is going to be how many of this is like the third and fourth of these we've

[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:22.680]
had, I believe, or we had what?

[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:28.000]
Yeah, this is now today's number three, the number four and got only notes since it's

[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]
done there on the second four we haven't brought the schedule up yet.

[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:34.560]
As the beach boys would say, got only knows how many more of these crappy right in the middle

[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:38.880]
to extra big when I even talking about games that count, even assuming that there were people

[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.780]
out there who care who don't.

[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:45.820]
These are games that are like kids out there in a sand lot plan as far as how much they

[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:46.100]
mean.

[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:53.420]
I hope we have 50,000 Cubans out there protesting today, even if they don't care about the

[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:57.620]
Orioles going to Cuba, just protesting something, just for a little excitement out there at

[00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:58.020]
the stadium.

[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.580]
Here's Fort Lauderdale, hello.

[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:01.480]
Hello, Neil.

[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:02.240]
Two things.

[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.440]
First of all, we only listen to you.

[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:09.340]
We don't tune in to your radio station any other time unless you're there.

[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:12.160]
So when you go off the air today, we go to another channel.

[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.500]
In other words, we'll be able to hear the sounds of dials clicking all over town at the

[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:16.320]
1250 today.

[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:17.060]
That's correct.

[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:22.760]
We also started in here that we wish that it was the Marlin playing with Cubans instead

[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:23.580]
of Baltimore.

[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:27.140]
That way the people could be protesting over who's going to be the home team.

[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:30.780]
Okay, over something with gentlemen.

[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:31.480]
Yeah.

[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:32.440]
Hey, well, thanks, Neil.

[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:35.520]
And we'll be listening to you until 1250 and then we'll back to that.

[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.820]
Okay, I still can't hold me this.

[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:37.180]
Thank you.

[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:37.520]
Okay.

[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:38.140]
Good point.

[00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:38.540]
That was good.

[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:39.220]
I like that line.

[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.660]
Yeah, that George Fabergass cut the crap.

[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:43.040]
Okay.

[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.640]
Jorge cut the bullcrap George.

[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:45.700]
I heard that bull yesterday.

[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:46.260]
Oh, yeah.

[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.340]
We're very opposed to this.

[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:48.280]
And what can we do?

[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.120]
What can we do?

[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.620]
I think, yeah, I'm doing this L Martino routine.

[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:53.560]
You know, what can I do?

[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:54.220]
Godfather.

[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:55.440]
Yeah, act like a man.

[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:55.840]
Okay.

[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:58.820]
Watch out and cut the bullcrap or send you back to you of them.

[00:50:58.880 --> 00:50:59.360]
Okay, Jorge.

[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:01.400]
Oh, yeah.

[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:03.340]
The people who were watching today was a good guy.

[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:05.000]
Oh, God.

[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:08.020]
It's same old tired garbage man.

[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:08.920]
The same old.

[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:10.240]
He's a bastard.

[00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:10.960]
We hate him.

[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:11.600]
He's a prick.

[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.880]
He's a dick tater.

[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.320]
He's a dick tater.

[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:15.200]
Okay.

[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.960]
Is there any doubt about that?

[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:17.420]
Okay.

[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.040]
Next topic.

[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:22.640]
Then, you know, just restating the obvious over and over and over again.

[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:24.080]
You know, and what about that?

[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.940]
You have to have put in those women a cuba in there.

[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:26.820]
What do you think about that?

[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.040]
Sure pork me off.

[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.240]
You can't go fuck yourself.

[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.480]
Good by Florida's teeth.

[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:38.320]
Nice, wild and lasting.

[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:46.980]
By lading the Florida tradition of apathy when you taste the gaze too well.

[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.580]
Next season will be here.

[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:51.720]
Yes.

[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.100]
Thanks to that polypacer.

[00:51:54.660 --> 00:52:00.940]
Wiling down how he lost his lunch money so he gave you up like a thousand cents

[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:02.300]
of noshpa.

[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:12.520]
And now you're all gonna live after what you achieve to where a world series makes.

[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:12.860]
Yes.

[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:19.300]
The flight you've made in will be co-cheats of all A again.

[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:24.280]
The beat counters don't sell no dollar.

[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.580]
How hard you try.

[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:31.040]
I'd like to see ways of it to a side.

[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.980]
Jump off this wall and inside.

[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.360]
All right.

[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:39.740]
Good by Florida's teeth.

[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:45.820]
A darn good thing that you played in day-county cause of our day-task.

[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:49.660]
The law against anything that too much fun.

[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:53.880]
And when the panthers come.

[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.100]
Squared toward you there to arena.

[00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:02.420]
I wouldn't be the problem if I'd thank a kill them up.

[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:05.300]
Should they ever win the Stanley Cup.

[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:15.000]
And now you're all gonna live after what you achieve to where a world series makes.

[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:23.060]
The flight you've made in will be co-cheats of all A again.

[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:27.380]
The beat counters don't sell no dollar.

[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.740]
How hard you try.

[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:34.280]
I'd like to see ways of it to a side.

[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:37.260]
Jump off this wall and inside.

[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:38.920]
Love the 15th is fine.

[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.900]
I'm just gonna be trying to see the watch cover hit it right on the head.

[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:44.820]
It's like putting a big black hole right in the middle of the daytime here.

[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.940]
Taking a valuable airtime from this show from Hank show.

[00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:51.080]
All those great interviews that Hank does like the one with Will Clark yesterday.

[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:53.900]
Slot poker machines out of roll.

[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:56.080]
This article says I told you there's some good news today.

[00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:56.500]
Ow!

[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:57.520]
Have you ever seen his got problems?

[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:58.280]
He's only worth what?

[00:53:58.420 --> 00:53:59.620]
One and a half big and something like that.

[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:00.400]
He's got some real tourists.

[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:06.640]
A buildup would allow electronic poker and slot machines in racetracks and high-life frontons.

[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:09.420]
Cruise through the house regulated service committee in town last year.

[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:10.860]
On an 8-2.

[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:11.980]
8-2 nothing vote.

[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:13.720]
All right.

[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:15.580]
Oh, it's about time.

[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.660]
You know, they've been doing this in other places for a while now.

[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.980]
And as usual, we're a dollar late and 50 years short.

[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:21.100]
Or is it the other way around?

[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:26.580]
Representative Dave Vittner, Republican of Port Charlotte, the bill sponsor said it would not expand gambling.

[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.860]
Because it confines the machines to places where gambling is already going on.

[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.160]
That makes sense to me, Dave.

[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:31.960]
Right on, baby.

[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:36.060]
Get some damn money in these joints and keep them alive and give us something to do there.

[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.960]
I know my friend Ted Snell must be having a party in his pants over this.

[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.300]
This is only a first ever course.

[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:41.480]
The past committee.

[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:43.020]
It's the guy to go through the entire legislature.

[00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:44.380]
But this is a good start.

[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:51.920]
School children as well as per mutual facilities will benefit of the estimated $10 billion that gamblers would spend in the machines.

[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:55.040]
The state would collect an average of 10% or $1 billion a year.

[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:58.380]
Of that, $280 million would be used for construction of schools.

[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:01.220]
Another 100 million would be used for programs for senior citizens.

[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.100]
Oh, there you go.

[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:03.480]
Now we're going to take care of everybody, baby.

[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:07.280]
Roughly 600 million year will be returned to per mutual facilities.

[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:10.840]
At least a million a year would go to programs that help problem gamblers like head camp on.

[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:11.500]
There you go.

[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:12.460]
We've got everybody covered.

[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:14.220]
I love it.

[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.440]
Let's do it like right starting tonight at Poppital Park.

[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:17.700]
Let's on on Mastos.

[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.340]
And of course, you know who's going to be psychotic?

[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:20.760]
Bobby Butterworth.

[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:21.380]
That's right.

[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:24.360]
Those evil slot machines.

[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:26.460]
They all have that same number 666.

[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:29.720]
El Anticlisto is hiding inside every slot machine in the world.

[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.240]
That's what Bobby Butterworth says.

[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:32.820]
You know what we say about Bobby Butterworth?

[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:33.580]
He's an asshole.

[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:34.140]
Big time.

[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:34.600]
Idiot.

[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:35.340]
Jackass.

[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:41.400]
I wonder how much money the taxpayers had a foot to build for for that big Ken Jenny raid.

[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:42.840]
Along with Bobby Butterworth.

[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:47.180]
On the cruise ships where they had to bring them back all their slot machines and give everybody back their money.

[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:50.560]
How much did that cost us for that fiasco?

[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:52.600]
Here's Kendall.

[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:52.900]
Hello.

[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:55.260]
Kendall.

[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:56.360]
Yes, hey, they're new.

[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:56.820]
Okay.

[00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:57.780]
A couple of things.

[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.660]
I'd like to say that I am a sports fanatic and I love sports.

[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:03.920]
But you could not pay me to watch them until we're into the most games.

[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:04.840]
How many 50s?

[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:06.380]
You know, I mean, that's just how many?

[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:07.580]
How about 100 bucks?

[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:08.860]
Now, no, nothing.

[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:12.260]
How about if we pay everybody $5,000 to listen to the Marlon game?

[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:15.980]
I think that you probably then get people to listen to it.

[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:16.960]
For a couple of minutes.

[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:17.980]
Maybe for half an inning.

[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:18.960]
Yeah, maybe for half an inning.

[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:23.060]
I went once to a preseason game and I'll tell you.

[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:28.080]
They're boring to be asked and let alone to sit there and listen to a radio on the game means nothing.

[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.740]
And the Marlon's are horrible.

[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.640]
And he's got horrible team and a meeting with me.

[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:35.860]
What track were they smoking when they decided to put this on in the middle of the day?

[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:39.000]
Now those old Cubans are outside protesting screaming to hell with Fidel.

[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.020]
I mean, what is that?

[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:40.620]
I don't know.

[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:41.140]
Who needs that?

[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.540]
I'll say I think I'd rather listen to Spanish radio.

[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.640]
But anyway, I know how to do that.

[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:47.660]
Okay, thanks for the good news.

[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:50.680]
Okay, there's a guy that's just like me with the exhibition hockey games.

[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:51.700]
I love hockey, you know that.

[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:52.240]
I'm a maniac.

[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.500]
But do I even go to the, I have free tickets.

[00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:56.960]
Do I go to the exhibition hockey games?

[00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:57.160]
No.

[00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:57.980]
Not a chance.

[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:00.020]
Not on your life, mister.

[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:03.320]
Even when they were inaugurating the new Mac Arena, they were playing exhibition games that I go.

[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:03.600]
No.

[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:03.860]

[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:09.740]
Exhibition any game is like, it's like listening to paint dry on the phone.

[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:14.720]
Not just listening to paint dry, but listening to it over the telephone long distance.

[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:16.540]
That's how boring that is.

[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:22.100]
And I wonder how that, what kind of a deal they got, you know, this whole deal and they're all in court,

[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.600]
and they're all screaming and yelling back at each other.

[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:28.220]
What kind of a deal that we had that were forced to carry exhibition baseball games in the middle of the day time?

[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.940]
And God forbid you, you know, why not getting UM sports, which I don't think that's final, but it's got to be close.

[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:35.800]
I mean, it's a done deal.

[00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.620]
I'm pretty sure we want to get a UM sports.

[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:44.980]
And as much as I cherish the memory of my six years broadcasting UM baseball a hundred years ago, that was a lot of fun.

[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:51.300]
But once you get into those regionals in the college world series, not another stuff which the Hercune's do just about every year,

[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:53.880]
a lot of those games are like right there in the middle of the day time.

[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.180]
Those get big numbers, huh?

[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:55.420]
No.

[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.160]
Oh, boy.

[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.020]
Whoa.

[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:01.700]
You can just smell that bonus money going by by.

[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:03.340]
Here's Kendall.

[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:03.840]

[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:04.700]
Neil, good afternoon.

[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:05.160]
Yes, sir.

[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:06.520]
I was in late last night.

[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:07.820]
I saw the first four goals.

[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.860]
It was a flat, kind of flat.

[00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:13.100]
It was like the Boston game a couple weeks ago.

[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:13.900]
It was terrible.

[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:16.000]
We were skating in soup.

[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.800]
Oh, my God.

[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:18.800]
We were just terminal.

[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.920]
You know, but San Jose wasn't much better.

[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:22.120]
We were just flat.

[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:23.440]
We just got to come back.

[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:24.720]
Every time we had a team, our game was played, it's a coma game.

[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.420]
Well, that's the first time in six that there's been a decision.

[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:31.320]
So anyways, I don't dislike the Marlins.

[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:34.160]
I'm not going to listen to them because I'm just the last strike.

[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:36.360]
I've given up on baseball.

[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.140]
I think the majority of the players are just prostitutes.

[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:39.440]
Yeah.

[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:43.320]
So the last strike and then, of course, these ridiculous salaries because of this thing.

[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:43.520]

[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:45.180]
Four teams in five years.

[00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:46.060]
That was the end for me.

[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:46.540]
I can't admit.

[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:47.440]
They're all about your horse.

[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:47.860]
You're right.

[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:48.400]
That's it.

[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:50.800]
And I've been a Yankee fan and a brave fan.

[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:53.060]
And I haven't watched in over four years.

[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:54.020]
And I'm not going to.

[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:55.620]
But I don't boo the Marlins.

[00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:58.600]
You know, you want a local team to do well, but not with my buck.

[00:58:58.780 --> 00:58:59.040]
Okay.

[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:02.180]
You know what I object to is it's not good business.

[00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:04.060]
You're top rated show.

[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:08.120]
I mean, you're the only time during the day where there's a break from the sports.

[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:10.080]
And the next draft, the marino.

[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:11.100]
I mean, oh my god.

[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:16.240]
What is wrong with Florida Marlins baseball joined in progress?

[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:17.500]
Why not that?

[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:18.200]
Two o'clock.

[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:18.960]
Exactly.

[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:19.660]
I'm good in mind.

[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:22.180]
Well, he's over there and no, he's in Bahamas.

[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:22.960]
The crystal palace.

[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:24.060]
Then I wouldn't infringe on his gambling.

[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:27.100]
And that guy that just phone, you know, he's right for 20 years.

[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.340]
I've had to buy exhibition football tickets.

[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:30.500]
They come with the packages.

[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.100]
That's the ones that will throw your money away.

[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:32.380]
Right.

[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:32.860]
That's right.

[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.280]
I'm on fire with it.

[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:36.040]
Well, we hope Florida can come back.

[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:36.580]
Have a nice day.

[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:36.820]
Okay.

[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:37.760]
Thank you.

[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:39.420]
Okay.

[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:40.480]
We got a couple open lines here.

[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:42.380]
We got another hour and a half to kill until 1250.

[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:43.440]
And then we're out of here, man.

[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:44.080]
We're gone.

[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:44.620]
Van Luse.

[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.800]
Stay tuned by the way for my doctor coming in taking a gallon of blood.

[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:48.600]
He just called.

[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:50.080]
And said he's on his way.

[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:50.540]
All right.

[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.600]
Dr. Doleville.

[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.080]
I mean, Dr. Mark is on his way.

[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.540]
Dr. LaPort is a great guy.

[00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:55.740]
Good to tag in point.

[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:56.640]
Ever stole a freight train.

[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:57.440]
He means well.

[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:58.800]
He don't do much, but he's a good guy.

[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.500]
Comes all the way up here to take my blood.

[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:01.960]
This is the second time, by the way.

[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.500]
So I can't say he don't do much.

[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.240]
Well, after he takes the blood, he don't do much.

[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:06.520]
Huh?

[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.300]
He's a minimalist.

[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.140]
That's his approach.

[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:11.000]
I like that word.

[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.040]
Because if you look up the word in the dictionary,

[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.380]
you'll see Dr. Doleville's picture next to it.

[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:15.980]
He's a minimalist.

[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.780]
He doesn't like overreacting, giving you a lot of drugs.

[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:21.840]
He likes taking it slow and easy, and see if you stay alive.

[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.260]
And then if you do, then we might do something down the road.

[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:28.440]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:34.620]
We're searching desperately for somebody, for some reaction to these Marlin exhibition games here in the middle of the day time.

[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:35.660]
Saus or no sauce?

[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.800]
I'm going to put your pardon on your, uh, little bit of sauce.

[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.460]
Of course, a little bit of sauce.

[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:43.400]
Crazy.

[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:48.200]
I mean, on your pizza and lasagna, Jeff Cohen, like I said, is doing because it's almost pay soft again.

[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:49.320]
The thing you did last year,

[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.420]
Matsu pizza and Matsu lasagna.

[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:52.980]
Good stuff, too, by the way.

[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:58.200]
Now, on your pizza and lasagna, you want a little bit of tomato sauce, which is good to fight prostate cancer.

[01:00:58.380 --> 01:00:58.800]
Squirt, squirt.

[01:00:58.860 --> 01:00:59.080]
That's right.

[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:00.820]
But niecey over there, it chucks.

[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.200]
We don't want sauce on our balls.

[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.660]
On your pizza and lasagna, you want sauce, but you certainly don't want no sauce.

[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:06.300]
Squirt, squirt.

[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:06.860]
On your balls.

[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.000]
I like it.

[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.520]
Especially if it's chocolate and salty.

[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.680]
That's what Roy said.

[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:17.640]
5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.060]
Here's Port St. Lucy.

[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:19.320]
Hello.

[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.440]
Okay, nice talking to you, too.

[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.660]
23 minutes to hang on there.

[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:26.440]
And then when the magic moment came, he, uh, crept on.

[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:28.540]
Here's Miami.

[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:28.820]
Hello.

[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:30.620]
Okay.

[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.660]
Okay, down to two calls in the board.

[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:33.640]
You got a short show today.

[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.400]
And the audience can't keep it up until 1250.

[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.100]
You know something.

[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.380]
I'm beginning to think it's a good idea.

[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:38.480]
We got the marlins on there.

[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:40.180]
There's no interest in the show.

[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.440]
I got more.

[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:42.860]
We got pot on our front page.

[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.640]
We got slot machines at the tracks coming.

[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.580]
Maybe it looks pretty good.

[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:49.880]
We got crazy old Cuban trying to burn down a guy named gay club there for a lot of day.

[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.120]
It was all pissed off about you.

[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.640]
Have there put in a Cuban woman naked in Playboy magazine.

[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.440]
We got buddy about passion losing his ass.

[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.060]
We got 50 billion things going on here in the naked city.

[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.020]
I thought this morning it was going to be sizzling today.

[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:01.840]
Smoking.

[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.380]
And guess what?

[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:07.060]
Same old, you know, you deserve the ball game, folks.

[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:09.740]
You don't deserve a guy that comes in here with a little bit of energy like me.

[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.640]
Here's your last chance.

[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:12.000]
Okay.

[01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:13.040]
And then I'm going to play a.

[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.380]
And you've been to several places for spring training.

[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.400]
I'm going to play that the whole rest of the show today.

[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.440]
If you guys don't put you up and get with it again on the stick.

[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.120]
5 6 7.

[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:22.600]
I will.

[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:23.160]
Clark.

[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:26.740]
5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.460]
Let's get with it.

[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:29.380]
Given you something very.

[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.260]
The management of radio station is listening carefully.

[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:32.700]
Okay.

[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:37.040]
They're in broad and this big legal account of tops with a Wayne and a Marlins people.

[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:40.420]
And you're sitting out there, mums the word all the time, mums the word.

[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:41.700]
How you doing, mums?

[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:43.380]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:43.660]
Hello.

[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:44.860]
Hi, God.

[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:45.520]
Yes, sir.

[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:47.640]
I think I was just picking up.

[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:48.220]
Just jealous.

[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:50.600]
I'm not going to be welcome if they ever go back, right?

[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.080]
There's Sam again sticking his ass in the door here.

[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:54.360]
And sitting down by their.

[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.800]
And my producer while the show is going on.

[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:56.280]
What is it?

[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.560]
Can you play a crack city?

[01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:58.460]
Don't wink at me.

[01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.020]
Okay, Sam.

[01:02:59.160 --> 01:02:59.460]
Believe me.

[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.940]
I wouldn't touch you with George's hand.

[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:02.200]
You want to play okay.

[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:02.940]
I'll work on it.

[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.200]
See, I'm a little bit.

[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.240]
I realize I thought once we're up here because we're in the room.

[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.320]
It's got no windows on it.

[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:11.320]
We got a nice big heavy door which we can't lock from the inside by the way.

[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.580]
I just thought I'd mention that.

[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:15.360]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:16.520]
Are following these numbers now.

[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:17.420]
Watch the bouncing ball.

[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.160]
5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:22.420]
We pay for the mobile call.

[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:23.880]
And we still can't really get these.

[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]
I'm talking about some motivation here today.

[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.080]
I'm going to have them put all the exhibition games on a few folks don't care

[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:34.480]
with it because like I said, I think there's better better response for the Marlin games than there is for me.

[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.880]
Passive, passive, passive, sit back and take.

[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.160]
You have nothing in return.

[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:42.180]
Sounds pretty good.

[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.260]
Here's a lady in Pepperpine.

[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:43.620]
Tell her.

[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:44.400]
Hi Neil.

[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:45.060]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:47.800]
I don't care about the Marlin theater.

[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.700]
When you go off, I turn my radio off.

[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:51.940]
Listen.

[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:54.940]
Do you win the Marlins Zarnon like when Hank is on you turn it off?

[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:55.920]
Oh, yeah.

[01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:57.840]
I'm afraid I'm not into sports.

[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:58.520]
That's okay.

[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:00.100]
Do you get HBO?

[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.500]
After hearing that interview yesterday, I don't think he is either.

[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.200]
Yes, I do.

[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.420]
I don't watch it, though.

[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.740]
Listen, there's something on that's really good.

[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:10.360]
It's going to be on around one...

[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.460]
You have to put your views on...

[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:12.340]
Are we not putting it in here?

[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:13.200]
Pardon me?

[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.360]
But I'll be home by then.

[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.460]
Well, I'll be home by one by one, 30 maybe.

[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:17.840]
No, no, no, one a.m.

[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.680]
You have to tape this.

[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:21.040]
It's called private dicks.

[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:24.260]
It's about men talking about their penises.

[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.580]
I haven't seen that, but I read about it, yes.

[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.860]
Oh, I saw a few minutes of it.

[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:29.280]
It looks pretty good.

[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.720]
Now, I did before after they splited under the partition in the restroom.

[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:34.580]
They could...

[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:35.620]
I don't know.

[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:36.460]
They might get to that.

[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:36.940]
I don't know.

[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.320]
Does I sure like to see how they do that?

[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:39.920]
Yeah.

[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.560]
Well, I wouldn't...

[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.160]
Thank you.

[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:44.620]
I don't mean I'm close in personal.

[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:45.400]
I mean from a distance.

[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:46.640]
Oh, listen.

[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:51.200]
Did you mention the news that was so important last week.

[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:51.840]
Yes.

[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.560]
They said in the news that they found out that circumcision does not

[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.400]
have enough advantages to warrant using it anymore.

[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.340]
They say that it caused it.

[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:03.860]
That study was written by Glam.

[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:04.500]
Don't you understand?

[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.420]
No, really.

[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:05.740]
Yeah.

[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:06.620]
It was.

[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:09.600]
Well, I'm surprised you didn't bring it up.

[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:10.800]
I thought in your opinion.

[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:11.100]
What?

[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.680]
It was written by Romans, ancient Romans, with the Monocony.

[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:18.080]
So I had that baggy little haircut, Greg Reed.

[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:20.680]
Well, it's an important news.

[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:21.920]
I thought you should know about it.

[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:22.640]
I'll check it out.

[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.140]
Okay.

[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.420]
I'm doing a study out of myself.

[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:25.500]
Have a great day, sweetheart.

[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.120]
Thank you, guys.

[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:26.760]
I love the world, yeah.

[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:29.240]
If it's a lotion in the basket.

[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:32.340]
Hey, so your chest is looking pretty thick today.

[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.160]
Thanks, Jen.

[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:35.520]
It's my new Kleenex 18-hour bra.

[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:36.100]
Really?

[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:36.520]
Yes.

[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:38.160]
You're flat-chested like me.

[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.180]
You should try it.

[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:40.320]
It keeps me stiff.

[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:42.700]
Even when I'm not fiercely involved with anyone.

[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:43.720]
So what if it rains?

[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:44.540]
Don't worry.

[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.220]
The Kleenex 18-hour bra has extra endorsances that make you look even bigger

[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:50.120]
in a good thunderstorm.

[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:53.600]
And the quilted layers of tissue help cursen your nipples

[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.380]
and somebody really cute lost by.

[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.880]
And I bet it's great for tears.

[01:05:57.140 --> 01:06:00.040]
When your guy finds out that it's 36th, he's having a real.

[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.980]
A new Kleenex 18-hour bra.

[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:05.120]
Strong enough for a manhandle and made for a rain.

[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.580]
It's all of the 31 at 560 WQM.

[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.220]
We got the big ballgame coming up.

[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.660]
There is phenomenal interest in this.

[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.480]
I don't even know what I'm talking to myself for here, you know?

[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:15.580]
Because psychologically, you know,

[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:16.960]
and we got the game coming at 1250.

[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:18.640]
Most of the audience is gone already anyhow.

[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:19.540]
Never dawned on me.

[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.500]
Slow I am.

[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.140]
After the Marlins in the Oriole game,

[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:24.360]
if we can get any of the audience back,

[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:26.240]
Hank is over at the Crystal Palace in Bahamas.

[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.380]
He'll be on After Marlins baseball till 730.

[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.560]
And 730, we got some NCAA back-to-back games.

[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.480]
You got St. John's Maryland,

[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.400]
and you got Connecticut and Iowa.

[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.760]
And then of course this weekend,

[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:39.900]
you got my team playing Michigan State.

[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:41.240]
And my number two team, Miami.

[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.340]
Well, if you're living in Miami, why not root for Miami?

[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:44.540]
Okay, even if they do play in Ohio.

[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.960]
And even if Walty's got a lot of vowels in his name.

[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:49.280]
I mean, a lot of, so whatever they are.

[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.060]
Seas and Zs and Ss and Ks,

[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.200]
SCQZ, whatever the hell his name is.

[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.220]
A lot of consonants.

[01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:57.700]
Here's a mobile in Kendall.

[01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:58.000]
Hello.

[01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.000]
Neil.

[01:06:59.240 --> 01:06:59.520]
Yes, sir.

[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.340]
I would rather listen to a Marlins game than a sports talk.

[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.600]
But it's ridiculous that they would touch your slime.

[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.860]
So your slime stop.

[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:06.840]
Your time spot.

[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:07.240]
Whatever.

[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.100]
Slime slide, yeah.

[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.080]
Yes, they are my slime slot.

[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:10.500]
Yeah.

[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:11.180]
Well.

[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:12.460]
U-S holes.

[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:14.520]
And Deli soccer balls.

[01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:16.020]
Okay, thanks.

[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:17.620]
There's a guy analyzing the whole station.

[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:18.460]
We already know that.

[01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:22.940]
560, 560, 0560 on the mobile one line.

[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.360]
Another day with a dead audience here today.

[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:26.320]
They got nothing material.

[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:27.600]
Here's Miami Beach.

[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:27.840]
Hello.

[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:30.280]
Miami Beach.

[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.260]
Like I said, here's Volca.

[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:33.540]
Hello.

[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:36.220]
Volca.

[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:36.920]
Yeah.

[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.380]
Are there anybody on these lines?

[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:40.340]
Are we just here for the go-through the motions?

[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:40.840]
Yeah.

[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:41.580]
They're speaking to me.

[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.680]
Yeah, I want to know what your opinion is on next year.

[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.360]
They're going to change the crease violation rule.

[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:45.780]
What's all that?

[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:46.320]
What's that about?

[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:47.440]
What do you want that about?

[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:49.480]
They're going to get rid of the dumbest rule in history of sports.

[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.340]
That's what's all about.

[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:51.660]
They should have done it this year.

[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:52.420]
Yeah, what we're saying.

[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:53.420]
I really agree with you.

[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.780]
I'm low-focke and I'm a great hockey fan.

[01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:57.080]
But I hate going to that arena.

[01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:57.720]
It's horrible.

[01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.380]
What did I say that?

[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:00.800]
I hate going to the arena.

[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:01.580]
I never said that.

[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.680]
Oh, you know, you know, when did I say that?

[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:06.360]
Well, you just all you talk about all day.

[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:07.580]
How much you do?

[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.040]
That's all I talk about all day.

[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:10.660]
Did I even mention that arena today?

[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:12.440]
Yeah.

[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.840]
I had to hear you pose.

[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:17.380]
That's all I talk about all day is how much I hate going to the arena because it's so far

[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:18.040]
from my house.

[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.140]
I will do the reason.

[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.880]
All I said was they got a few problems over there.

[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.300]
But if they'd iron them out, we'd be having a great time even during those boring games.

[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:31.660]
And if Pavell does come back next week, we got three great three great reasons to go.

[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:34.120]
He's in the first game, the second game and the third game.

[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.720]
Yeah, see there's another but sucker just wants me to agree.

[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:39.680]
Thought I said something.

[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.760]
So therefore, oh yeah, whatever you said, absolutely correct.

[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.480]
You know, say give me your own opinion.

[01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.260]
I don't want my opinion fed back to me.

[01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:45.500]
Okay.

[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:47.100]
Like the guy that I took calls yesterday.

[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.040]
Oh, that's struck.

[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:52.080]
Oh, yeah, just repeat back to me what I already know what I've been saying for the last 200

[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:52.640]
years.

[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:53.920]
That I don't need.

[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:55.580]
Sir.

[01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:58.380]
Absolutely incorrect, sir.

[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:00.900]
I'd have killed a few seconds.

[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:01.380]
Nice job.

[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:02.600]
5, 6, 7.

[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.780]
See, and what's going on around here?

[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:05.940]
This is not going to fly.

[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:07.460]
It's very disconcerting to me.

[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:09.000]
It is.

[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:11.740]
Too many people sticking their head in the goddamn arena.

[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:12.600]
And they're too many people.

[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.440]
In sand.

[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.680]
The last person.

[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.860]
Let's pick one day a week when sand can come in here for like about two minutes.

[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.840]
And we'll have an egg timer.

[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:23.960]
And as soon as you come in, no, you turn it upside down there.

[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.740]
And as soon as the egg timer would be like a.

[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:26.960]
No, there'll be a.

[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:32.200]
Because man, I mean, you know, he thinks I'm joking.

[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.920]
When I look at him, my blood starts boiling.

[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:36.780]
I think Jesus.

[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:38.260]
I mean, it's guys on the payroll.

[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.060]
What do we have any idea what he's done?

[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:40.380]
No.

[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:42.840]
And he's sitting in that big room as well.

[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.300]
And yesterday, the story is it's not really going to be his office.

[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.620]
It's going to be a production studio.

[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:47.200]
Right.

[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.320]
But he's just kind of taken over in the interim until you're 25, 25 when they get around to

[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:56.380]
open the production studio and because that might cost them money to buy some equipment for real production studio.

[01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:58.220]
So he just kind of like took it over.

[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.660]
Because our PD's a wimp and he took a little tiny broom closet on the corner and said, OK.

[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:06.900]
Here's pop it.

[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:07.120]
And that's the old B.

[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:07.440]
Hello.

[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.460]
Hey, how you doing, Madam Killamy?

[01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:10.900]
I know.

[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:12.000]
Now they're always killing me.

[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:13.540]
This audience is killing me all this week.

[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:17.000]
First week in the new studio, which I'm starting to like these new studios, I'm getting used to them.

[01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:19.660]
But the audience this week, I wouldn't wish them on Heinrich Himmler.

[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.260]
That's actually why I'm calling you.

[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.640]
You talking about the equipment all the time.

[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:25.740]
I worked in radio for several years.

[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:27.080]
The God awful board off.

[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:28.460]
And I got out.

[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.240]
Congratulations, juicer.

[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:32.160]
Well, two weeks ago, I got back in.

[01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:33.860]
Oh, like I said, my condolences.

[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:36.240]
And I walked into the station.

[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:37.580]
I wanted to mention the call letters.

[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.740]
And the clock and the timer on the board did not work.

[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:46.560]
The remedy was taping a $6 stopwatch from Walmart onto the board with Scotch tape.

[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:48.080]
How strong was that?

[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:49.960]
And it wasn't even good Scotch tape.

[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:52.920]
It was the cheap $3 dollar solar tape, the yellows and crass.

[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:53.440]
Here you go.

[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:54.640]
Well, you know, times are tough.

[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:56.060]
And I'm back out again.

[01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:57.040]
What is having a rough time?

[01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:58.720]
David Ross is having a tough time.

[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:00.060]
Rubbin is things together over there.

[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:01.340]
Things are tough all the way around.

[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:02.480]
We got problems here.

[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.580]
You know, Wayne wants our money.

[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:04.660]
We don't want to give it to him.

[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:07.500]
Well, I just want to say in a back out radio.

[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:09.040]
And I'm never going back in.

[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.080]
If you go the boudre, for God's sake.

[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.860]
I thought you were going to say they just got back into it.

[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:12.720]
I got out.

[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.720]
When that stopwatch is taped under the board, why would I want to stay?

[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:16.220]
Okay, guys.

[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.820]
Okay, go do more of the old in and out.

[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.240]
Okay, this guy is making up stories.

[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:22.980]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, and pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.100]
I'm always not making up the story about taping the stopwatch.

[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:25.640]
That's true.

[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:32.460]
I mean, yeah, but you know, they're old saying they can only hear what comes out through the road.

[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:32.740]
And they're not going to hear what comes out of the radio.

[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:34.300]
They can't see what's going on on the inside.

[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.580]
So just fake it for us and pretend we're giving you some good stuff.

[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:41.000]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.

[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:42.940]
I think I'm going to get involved in that lawsuit.

[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.180]
I'm going to sue both parties.

[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:49.200]
Well, seriously, because this Marlon stuff is a killer all the way around.

[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.020]
Here's a mobile and Cape Coral.

[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:51.240]
Hello.

[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:55.780]
A meal, a pig report over here in the White Coast for the other three people listening.

[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:56.280]
Yeah.

[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.820]
They're set up over the midpoint Memorial Bridge.

[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:02.160]
So Tony Philanjell, watch out.

[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:03.740]
OK, sir.

[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:05.440]
Thanks for a killing those 10 seconds.

[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.100]
Here's a mobile and bell harbor.

[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:08.360]
Hello.

[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:10.760]
Hello.

[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:11.340]
Yes, sir.

[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:12.620]
Good morning.

[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:13.820]
Good morning, sir.

[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.780]
It's time for you to be insanity, please.

[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:16.140]
Be patient.

[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:16.740]
Meaning what?

[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:17.320]
What does that mean?

[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.220]
These people, where do they come from?

[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:20.220]
What are your callers?

[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:21.520]
Where are these people coming from?

[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.080]
Don't be commenting on the other callers.

[01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:24.880]
Let's hear your material.

[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:25.480]
What do you got?

[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:26.520]
I got a lot.

[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:27.420]
Last night.

[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:34.820]
We left John Lartons and we went right into a speed trap checkout point on St. Paddy's Day.

[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:36.680]
They had everybody.

[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:37.700]
They could have...

[01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.180]
Yeah, well, I said they for it.

[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:40.360]
It was.

[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:45.140]
Anyway, what we need to do right now is have some lunch and make us laugh.

[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:46.220]
OK?

[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:47.420]
What does that mean?

[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:48.280]
Have a nice day.

[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:48.820]
I see it.

[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:49.520]
There's not a number.

[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.600]
He's not going to get a callers.

[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:51.560]
Here's a guy with no material.

[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:52.320]
It's slow down.

[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.960]
You old drunk and Irishman slowed down.

[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.500]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:02.720]
I guess I'm going to have to get my earlsmith album and get a great new live album.

[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.480]
See, this is what kills me about this audience.

[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:07.740]
They're belly aching.

[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:09.260]
Oh, gee, they're cutting the show short.

[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:11.860]
We only got two hours and 50 minutes today and again tomorrow.

[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:16.620]
I said here I'd gone for 40 minutes rambling about everything from alphabet soup to zebras

[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:17.500]
and everything in between.

[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.000]
And they got no response.

[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:23.160]
And this guy who's not going to the other callers, he has less than nothing.

[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:23.940]
You see, your body's funny.

[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.420]
It's cancer of the toenail, OK?

[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.160]
You're pathetic.

[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.380]
You're what's wrong with this town.

[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:30.100]
You're old.

[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:31.600]
You're shriveled up prune pal.

[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:33.380]
God.

[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:38.300]
Go stand outside the stadium up there for a lot of day over the Cuban, Zealand and Karen

[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:38.500]
on.

[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:38.820]
All right?

[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:43.560]
Maybe it'll, you know, convince you that you're alive or somebody else.

[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.480]
Downfall, but maybe.

[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.560]
Through the callers.

[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:50.000]
It's late at night.

[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.160]
You're all fast asleep and a shadowy figure is about to break into your home.

[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:55.960]
But you're protected.

[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:01.940]
Yes, it's the James Brown home security alarm.

[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:07.220]
The heart is working alarm in the safety business.

[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.000]
Designed by the Godfather of home protection himself.

[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:19.580]
The James Brown alarm protects you from regular.

[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.000]
Bando, beeping tall.

[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:25.700]
And if you act now, we'll include it no extra car.

[01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:29.380]
The patented James Brown hunt pants far along.

[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:34.700]
So put the soul patrol on your keyhole.

[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.860]
With the James Brown home security system.

[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.680]
You'll save.

[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:48.700]
It's 144-560 WDQ about another dreadful day in a big city.

[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:52.620]
We got 200 open lines and day 6000 and brown and 148 in a west coast.

[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:53.880]
2500 and Palm Beach.

[01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:55.620]
567-0560.

[01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.360]
We only got another hour and six minutes to kill.

[01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.900]
And the doctor's coming and Jeff Cohen's coming with the food.

[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:00.500]
So what are we here?

[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:01.180]
Do we really care?

[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:01.780]
No.

[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:02.380]
Now we don't care.

[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:04.520]
Here's Hollywood.

[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:04.860]
Hello.

[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:07.020]
Hello, Neil.

[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:07.560]
Yes, sir.

[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:10.120]
What a very interesting show, Queenie.

[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:11.820]
Okay, great.

[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.060]
Glad we're coming some good time for you, sweetie.

[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:16.820]
Oh, and I would think I had the sticks as penis out of the stall.

[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:19.140]
Here's a mobile and a box.

[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:20.280]
Here's a mobile and a hi-a-lea.

[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:20.540]
Hello.

[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:21.300]
Yeah.

[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.820]
I was calling about the racetrack yesterday.

[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:26.960]
It didn't fail to the four trees.

[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:27.420]
Yeah.

[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:30.460]
Well, I'll teach you to go to hi-a-lea, sucker.

[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:30.920]
Okay?

[01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:31.680]
Schmuck.

[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:33.520]
Guys going to hi-a-lea.

[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:36.140]
You should know that everything there is bogus.

[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:39.540]
And I noticed by the way that Dave Joseph was kind of like half-heartedly sucking

[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:42.420]
John Bernetti's butt in the paper this morning, which is a shock to me.

[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:44.340]
That's just amazing.

[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:46.400]
Dave, I don't know what's going on with that guy.

[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:49.560]
Yeah, the mutual system breaks down there.

[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.280]
People have to wait an hour in between races.

[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:52.180]
The food sucks.

[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:53.520]
I mean, hi-a-lea is just a disaster.

[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:55.200]
And everybody knows that.

[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:57.580]
And yet for some reason, they don't want to talk about it.

[01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:00.200]
John Bernetti is the antichrist when it comes to racing in the States.

[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:01.460]
So what are you going there, forcer?

[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:02.520]
Mathicus.

[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.260]
560560, 0560, 0560 on a mobile one line.

[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.300]
Here's a mobile and four-loader deal.

[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:09.480]
Hello.

[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:10.800]
Any other day?

[01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:11.540]
Okay, sir.

[01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:14.560]
I just want to let you know I've been spoken marijuana for 17 years.

[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:18.480]
And the only time I ever had an urge to use harder drugs was listening to Brian Norcross

[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.100]
trapped in a hurricane shot at shelter.

[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:20.600]

[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:21.340]
Yeah.

[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:22.840]
How was it?

[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.240]
I was looking to Brian Murray, yeah.

[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.560]
The locksmiths, Mississippi, you've been there yet?

[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:27.940]
No.

[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:29.820]
I was there a few weeks ago.

[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:30.560]
You got to try it.

[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:31.460]
Try it for what?

[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.260]
Just to go and have a good time.

[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.940]
Like, what are you doing, Vegas?

[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:36.540]
Playing my brain to us.

[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:38.020]
Well, do you do it there?

[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:39.580]
I don't want to go to Baluxi, Mississippi.

[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.040]
What a horrible thought of that is just grotesque.

[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:42.580]
It was nice.

[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:43.980]
I thought the same thing to I went.

[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.000]
What was nice about it?

[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.080]
What was nice about it?

[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.380]
What was nice clean casino?

[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:50.300]
It was an hour you can go to New Orleans for dinner and go back to New Orleans.

[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.440]
I don't want to go to New Orleans for dinner.

[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.540]
I don't want to go to New Orleans for anything.

[01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:52.880]
New Orleans.

[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:56.860]
It's a scuzzy, scummy place with the dumbest people I've even done more than here.

[01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:58.140]
Just to suggest.

[01:16:58.420 --> 01:16:59.400]
Okay, I'm glad you had a good time.

[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:02.180]
Not that I just want to sound hostile.

[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:05.140]
Am I going to Baluxi, Mississippi?

[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:05.400]
No.

[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.500]

[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:09.640]
Excuse me.

[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:36.400]
Specialidade is here to make it a reference window, So you can play fucking

[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:39.280]
I knew you had an anniversary sometime this month.

[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:40.800]
I wanted to call and say happy anniversary.

[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:42.460]
Well, thanks for the 18 days ago, too late.

[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.160]
Well, the thought was there anyway.

[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:49.400]
But I'm enjoying this show today, even though I know you're not.

[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.840]
Oh, no, this is the same as I do every day.

[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.880]
What was the last time I had a good call?

[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.180]
I can't remember.

[01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:00.240]
I can't remember the last good call we had on this show.

[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.720]
Well, I love listening whenever I can.

[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.680]
The bit you just played with the James Brown.

[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:08.240]
Yeah.

[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:14.680]
It reminded me of a bit you used to have the big black guy named somebody that says get away from the car.

[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.680]
Good black guy named Roy.

[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:17.360]

[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:17.980]
Right.

[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:19.900]
If you could play that sometime, that's a great way.

[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:20.420]
I sure will.

[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.920]
I'll kill two and a half minutes, I think.

[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.380]
I hope you enjoy your lunch.

[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:23.940]

[01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:35.240]
5607 0560 0560 0560 on the mobile one line.

[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:37.100]
Another desperate day on these phones.

[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.440]
Slaving over a lukewarm telephone.

[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:40.140]
That's what I do.

[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:42.040]
Who's that in the doorway, by the way?

[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:42.680]
Is that Dr. Mark?

[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:43.920]
That arm is too small.

[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:44.660]
It's Carlos.

[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:46.680]

[01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:47.780]

Anybody that's got stuff for us for free.

[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.040]
That doesn't mean people want to see.

[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.860]
There's our buddy from Collagen to best people in the world, by the way.

[01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:58.100]
There's a solid earth.

[01:20:58.940 --> 01:20:59.740]
How you doing, sir?

[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:01.360]

[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:10.740]
That's what I come in here for.

[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:13.820]
All of a sudden, these stupid phone calls, this idiotic chatter.

[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:15.800]
Hey, cleaning it all these red necks.

[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:16.860]
We don't care about any of that.

[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.260]
That just killed them good time.

[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:18.660]
That's all.

[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.260]
Which of course is a tremendous, you know,

[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:22.700]
that's a valuable asset in this town.

[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:24.600]
If we can do that for a kill a few hours a day.

[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:26.200]
Worth millions.

[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:31.860]
Got the Collagen people that are water cool around here with the free water and everything else.

[01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:34.460]
Got a regular service hook up with our fine sponsors from Collagen.

[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:36.900]
Next thing by next week one day,

[01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:40.400]
we'll have Duff his desk in there and his tiny little postage stamp size office.

[01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:43.660]
And I smell food, by the way.

[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:44.360]
Can you notice that?

[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:46.420]
This is the first time this is the fourth day we're in the studio.

[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.440]
And I smell food coming through the vent.

[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:51.860]
Smells like somebody's making spam or something like heating up spam.

[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.140]
Pull the TV dinner into microwave.

[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:55.220]
Oh, God.

[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.120]
No, I have not.

[01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.760]
Oh, be taken down there.

[01:21:58.840 --> 01:21:59.200]
I'm not going.

[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:01.980]
I'm getting nauseous just from smelling it.

[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:02.700]
I say lawsuit.

[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:07.180]
And they're talking about us eating the studio and lighting up a stokey.

[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:13.640]
Seriously, it smells like somebody just scooped a bunch of out of one of the turlots and popped it in the microwave for a quick lunch.

[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:16.140]
Man, is that rank?

[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.120]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:18.540]
Hello.

[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:19.640]
Hey, Neil.

[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:20.520]
Okay, sir.

[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.960]
Going to Italy for honeymoon soon.

[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:29.040]
And I wonder if you could give me some advice on some places to go and in Florence for dinner.

[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:29.980]
That'd have a thing.

[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.260]
Probably a restaurant would be good, you know?

[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:33.000]
Yeah, you think?

[01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:33.960]
Yeah, I would be good.

[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:34.740]
Okay.

[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.720]
Very expensive, very overpriced.

[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.980]
The food in Florence is nearly as good as it is in Rome.

[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:40.180]
But you'll have a good time.

[01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:42.220]
What about down in the Naples area?

[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:42.700]
How is that?

[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:43.520]
Now, I have never been there.

[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:44.340]
Only slippers done.

[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:45.280]
You don't want to go to Naples.

[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.600]
Only slippers and gypsies.

[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:47.440]
Is that right?

[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:48.540]
Stay out of Naples.

[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:49.940]
That's what everybody tells me.

[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:55.600]
A lot of poverty, a lot of gypsies, a lot of just filthy, you know, a lot of what do you want to Naples for?

[01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:58.380]
We want to go check out the coastline down there.

[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:00.780]
Well, you can check out the coastline, but don't go to Naples.

[01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:02.920]
Oh, I was staying outside in Naples.

[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:03.500]
Right, good.

[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:04.100]
Don't go anywhere.

[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:06.500]
Everybody tells me, do not go in the city.

[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:07.880]
Okay, pre-fitting that.

[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.520]
The Naples are at least same thing.

[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:10.220]
Train.

[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:11.440]
One more thing.

[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:11.840]
Yes.

[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:13.060]
Do you miss Rick Weaver?

[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:17.680]
Okay, we have 62 open lines in data, 187 and powered.

[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:20.880]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a mobile one line.

[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:23.180]
Here's Miami.

[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:23.440]
Hello.

[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:24.340]
Hey, Neil.

[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:24.980]
Yes, sir.

[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.140]
Hey, you should have that breeze up inside your ass.

[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:28.140]
Oh, you got rid of that.

[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:28.480]
Uh-huh.

[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.560]
Yeah, I got a pain in the ass.

[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.320]
It was just on the phone here for about three seconds.

[01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:33.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:34.540]
Oh, he's talking about my bruise.

[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:34.920]
Backed up.

[01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:35.400]
That's gone.

[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:37.480]
But I do have a pain in the ass, like I said.

[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:38.820]
It was on for about two and a half seconds.

[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:42.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 in pound, 5, 60 on a mobile one line.

[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.960]
And by the way, go back to New York with your bad, phony accent.

[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:46.800]
Well, they wouldn't let you come back.

[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.200]
Here's a mobile in Miami Lake.

[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:48.500]
Hello.

[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:50.480]
Yeah, I think you're right.

[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:51.440]
I think this town does.

[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:52.700]
I used to defend it.

[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:53.940]
No, I don't think this town sucks.

[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:54.940]
This town does suck.

[01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:55.640]
No, you're right.

[01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:58.760]
I, I, I, it's like a whole malaise over everything.

[01:23:59.200 --> 01:23:59.200]

[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.480]
But it's just, like I said, when I first came here,

[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:02.740]
it didn't take me long to figure that out.

[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:03.500]
It's the walking dead.

[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:05.060]
Even the young people, they're most of them are dead.

[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:08.140]
Um, I'm a seasoned ticket holder for the Marlins.

[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:11.640]
But, um, spring training games, I don't want to listen.

[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.160]
There you go.

[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:12.740]
Who the hell does?

[01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:13.180]
Yeah.

[01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:16.800]
By the way, did you see that the auto-towel crashed at Hialeah?

[01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:20.340]
I guess Hank will have a role on the front of me fighting.

[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:21.260]
Well, the what crashed?

[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:22.640]
The auto-towel.

[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:24.180]
You know how they, the thing that told me that.

[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:25.500]
I was talking about that.

[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:26.600]
Yeah.

[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:27.420]
I just, I'm sorry.

[01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:30.400]
I called any city who's bitching about the fact he couldn't get his money back.

[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.400]
And I said a fool in his money, I assume, parted.

[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:33.180]
Oh, and Hialeah.

[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:35.520]
He's a high-booted at coast of Hialeah needs brain surgery.

[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:36.100]
Yeah.

[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.820]
They could like do like this guy.

[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:40.460]
I cut it up, brick by brick, and move it to a real community.

[01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:43.560]
There you go, and get your own brunetti out of there too would be good.

[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:44.040]
Yeah.

[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:46.660]
I'm going to hang with it.

[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:47.460]
I'm hanging on it.

[01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:48.300]
Okay, I'm hanging it.

[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:49.220]
Yeah, Dave Joseph.

[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.800]
What a, that was a real ass-sucking column this morning, Dave.

[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:56.700]
It sounded to me like brunetti, like orchestrated the whole column, basically.

[01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:59.620]
I mean, there were a couple of shots in there and a couple of digs and all the crap that happened.

[01:24:59.700 --> 01:24:59.960]
Or yesterday.

[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:02.600]
But, boy, that was sure hearts and flowers.

[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.760]
At a place that everybody knows has been totally destroyed.

[01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:07.640]
I tried to, you know, to work with those people years ago.

[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:10.000]
I remember all the wasted time I did on that with Hialeah.

[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000]
Oh, brother.

[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:13.140]
What a waste of time.

[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.940]
The food sucks, the ambiance sucks.

[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:18.740]
I mean, is it just a relic?

[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:20.880]
It's a, just a shadow of what it used to be.

[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:22.180]
And it's great days.

[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.360]
Everything keeps breaking down.

[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:26.320]
The tote breaks down.

[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:29.240]
Or yesterday, people can't get up bed and they have to delay races for now.

[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:30.080]
No surprise.

[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:36.000]
It's like I said, you know, about those assholes that bought the Holyfield pipe the other night.

[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.300]
Oh, we was robbed.

[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:39.280]
It was a, yeah.

[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:44.340]
And we'll let you know when the next scam comes along, okay?

[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:44.980]
Longing for sale.

[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.900]
50 or 60 or 70 bucks, suckers.

[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:48.340]
I'm glad it's worth it.

[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:49.100]
You've all from men.

[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.160]
Car theft is on the rocks.

[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:54.600]
America, a car is stolen every 12 seconds.

[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.620]
What can you do to protect your car?

[01:25:57.300 --> 01:26:00.820]
An expensive car alarm system won't protect your car from being stolen.

[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:04.040]
The club won't protect the valuables inside your car.

[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.820]
But a big black guy named Ben Can.

[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:08.780]
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:12.420]
For less than you'd pay for an expensive car alarm system.

[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:18.460]
And even less than you'd pay for the club, you can get a big black guy named Ben to protect your automobile.

[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:20.420]
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:22.540]
It's simple to use.

[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:26.560]
Just leave the big black guy named Ben in your car whenever you get out.

[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:28.060]
And he does the rest.

[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:33.160]
Whenever anyone gets within six feet of your car, Ben simply gets out of the car and tells them.

[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:34.700]
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:40.100]
Listen to these testimonials from people who use a big black guy named Ben.

[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:44.260]
It's always nice to have someone to ride with, although he really doesn't say much.

[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:46.160]
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:48.800]
That's about it.

[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:51.820]
I didn't get a big black guy named Ben to chat with.

[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.560]
I got him to protect my car.

[01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:56.080]
It's the best investment I've ever made.

[01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:58.100]
My name is Edithson, I create.

[01:26:58.660 --> 01:26:59.980]
There have been a lot of cars test.

[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:03.980]
I can't tell you how many times I've heard you get away from the car, motherfucker.

[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:09.300]
Knowing that I've got a big black guy named Ben protecting my car, let's me sleep better at night.

[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:09.980]
Calm down.

[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:11.980]
1-800-1 big guy.

[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:15.460]
That's 1-800-1-BIG-G-U-I.

[01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:20.620]
And instead of hearing this, you'll hear this.

[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.400]
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:23.660]
I am in shock.

[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:24.740]
I'm just watching CNN.

[01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:26.720]
They got the... I didn't even realize this.

[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.060]
William Cunard is his name.

[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.520]
He's the new chairman of the FCC, the Schwarzer.

[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:33.980]
For real life complex, it's not on there anymore.

[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:34.540]
You're too late.

[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.280]
Life complex, it's a show.

[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:41.400]
Is the chairman of the FCC, which changes the whole thing now in the words that we can say?

[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.540]
Because now that means that mother's only half a word.

[01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:46.120]
Isn't that what that means?

[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:46.480]
Uh-huh.

[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:46.880]
Yeah.

[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:50.900]
So I think we're going to kind of loosen up the language requirements here on the radio.

[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:52.160]
All right, let's hear it.

[01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:52.520]
Oh!

[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:53.560]
Forget old Billy Boy.

[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:55.560]
5-6-7-0-5.

[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:56.200]
Don't call him boy.

[01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:57.660]
5-6-7-0-5-60.

[01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:00.080]
And pound 5-60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:01.700]
You know, it's a good thing we do have a short charge.

[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:04.560]
Just thinking during that break, what if we were here until 2 o'clock today?

[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:06.160]
Yeah, what I thought that is.

[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.660]
I'm getting a headache just thinking about that.

[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.260]
So what are you complaining about?

[01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:14.300]
Thank God that we have a Marlon's exhibition this game coming on here at 1250 in this hour.

[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:15.720]
In less than an hour.

[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:17.280]
Thank God for that.

[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:20.220]
Here's North Miami.

[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:20.580]
Hello.

[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:21.640]
Hello, Dios.

[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:22.360]
See.

[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:23.040]
How are you?

[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:23.400]
Okay.

[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:27.060]
Well, I want to call in because I've been eating a lot of crap.

[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:32.720]
So I wanted to say hello to you and I heard your Florence story and you got, and I have a Galleria story.

[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:36.700]
And I want to share my Florence story with you and got, and my Florence story?

[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:39.920]
Well, you were saying that you did not like Florence or...

[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:41.780]
Now, when I said it all, I said it's a tourist trap.

[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:44.660]
I said it's okay, but the food is as good as Rome.

[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:46.180]
And it's highly overpriced.

[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:48.180]
It's a beautiful place to see for about two days.

[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:49.200]
That's all you need.

[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:50.780]
Oh, then I completely agree.

[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:54.980]
I found a few of the local trattories.

[01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:55.560]
Right.

[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:56.840]
And they were fantastic.

[01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:59.040]
Man, they were good, but not like Rome.

[01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:00.300]
Not like Rome.

[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:02.000]
I find it, yeah, you're right.

[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:03.560]
Rome, there is some incredible...

[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.920]
Even the cheap restaurants are incredible.

[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:07.280]
Right.

[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.460]
And the Galleria story, you know, is talking about the bathroom stalls.

[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:12.860]
Yeah.

[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:14.780]
So I'm in the Galleria with my wife.

[01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:18.320]
We both go to our appropriate bath.

[01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:19.020]
Respective stalls.

[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.080]
Respective stalls.

[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.740]
I come out before her and I'm standing there.

[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:30.220]
And this gang looking kids, you know, with the hair that looks like, I don't know, it's all up in the air, you know.

[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:31.660]
Gang here, yeah, gang here.

[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:32.680]
Yeah, gang here.

[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:34.520]
Got on it.

[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:35.860]
It was disgusting anyway.

[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:36.520]
What's going on, King?

[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:37.580]
Yeah, there you go.

[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:41.100]
So he comes over to me and he says, what do you want?

[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.360]
So what do you mean what do I want?

[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:44.760]
I'm standing here.

[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.260]
Are you taking a pole or something?

[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:47.060]
Yeah.

[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:47.840]
The wrong question.

[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:50.220]
The wrong question to have, right?

[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:54.320]
So he goes, no, he goes, do you need something?

[01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:57.280]
So I looked at him again.

[01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:59.260]
He's peddling drugs, man. Don't you get it?

[01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:01.960]
No, no, he wanted to the bathroom like three times.

[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:03.420]
He wanted me to follow him in there.

[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:05.240]
He was peddling drugs.

[01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:08.440]
You better get with the party.

[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:10.860]
You go over to Amsterdam, man, and wander around on the dam right?

[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:12.580]
Oh, you know, okay, get out of here.

[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:14.080]
This guy's so slow.

[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:16.440]
Crack, coke, rock.

[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:17.340]
What do you need?

[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:20.720]
So they have a good time in there or what?

[01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:24.840]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on our AT&T wireless line.

[01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:26.660]
Here's a mobile or less Palm Beach.

[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:26.920]
Hello.

[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:28.820]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:29.420]
Okay, sir.

[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.100]
Hey, long time, first time.

[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:40.340]
I was just sitting up here and I was Palm Beach waiting for a bridge to come down and it reminded me of a guy about seven or eight years ago that called up about the bridge tender.

[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:41.340]
You still got that on tape?

[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:41.720]
No.

[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:43.200]
You remember that?

[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:43.660]
No.

[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:45.300]
Oh, okay.

[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:47.020]
I thought it might be a good call.

[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:47.500]
I guess not.

[01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:48.600]
No, it wasn't.

[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:49.680]
Okay, here's the Toronto.

[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:50.060]
Hello.

[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:51.260]
Hey, Neil.

[01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:51.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:53.520]
What the hell is going on down there?

[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:55.120]
They're cutting your show short?

[01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:59.660]
They're cutting it short and I had a cut short at birth and now they're doing it the second time.

[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:00.420]
I'll finish me off.

[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:02.160]
Don't knock it.

[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:04.540]
I'm delighted they're cutting it short after this group today.

[01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:08.660]
I'm going to tell you, I don't want to hear any complaints from this audience that they're cutting the show short.

[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:12.980]
If they put on Tiddly Wings in 1250, it would be fine with me because these people couldn't eat.

[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:16.320]
They couldn't even make an hour's worth of reasonable calls here today.

[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:17.140]
So what are they, Bishop?

[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:18.720]
We only got a two hour and 50 minute show.

[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:20.000]
They got no material.

[01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:23.080]
All this week, this audience just, their brains are fried.

[01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:25.460]
I can't figure that out.

[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:26.860]
You got gorgeous weather down there.

[01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:28.160]
What's wrong with the people down there?

[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:29.100]
It's freezing up here.

[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:30.040]
Yeah, and?

[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:31.520]
It's a white cake.

[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:32.320]
You can never go on.

[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.120]
Let me just tell you this.

[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:35.400]
So what does weather have to do with people's mentality?

[01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:37.360]
Weather is not everything as you've discovered.

[01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:38.860]
Weather is nothing.

[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:40.380]
Well, yeah, but you know what?

[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.260]
And the winter keeps your shut in up here.

[01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:42.780]
Yeah.

[01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:45.680]
So listen, the Leafs suck the game last night.

[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:46.540]
The Leafs suck.

[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:47.880]
They're going through their coma phase.

[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:49.520]
Every team goes through their coma phase.

[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:50.820]
Otto was having a problem.

[01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:53.300]
Airby team has their, and the Leafs are in a shutdown.

[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.780]
Coma phase couldn't score into an empty net.

[01:31:57.740 --> 01:31:59.260]
We're going to have a playoff team, right?

[01:31:59.420 --> 01:31:59.560]
Huh?

[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.280]
We are going to have a playoff team.

[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:02.140]
Now, I hope so.

[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:04.220]
I mean, you only got, we only got 14 games left.

[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.560]
They better recuperate soon by another couple of days of this,

[01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:08.240]
and they better get their assing you again.

[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:09.600]
So listen, you know what?

[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:12.900]
If you get tired of Miami, why don't you come up here and do radio?

[01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:13.600]
Yeah, sure.

[01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:18.260]
I mean, the CTRC they have me off the air in the first half of IB out.

[01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:20.680]
Yes, how are you certain that his problems as well?

[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:21.260]
Right, exactly.

[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:22.640]
Well, good luck to us, pal.

[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:23.260]
Thanks.

[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:24.260]
Now, see on the rocket.

[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:24.880]
Okay.

[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:25.320]
Okay.

[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:27.280]
See on the rocket with the Russian rocket.

[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.300]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60, 05, 60,

[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:31.520]
on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:32.800]
Yeah, stop and think about it.

[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:34.640]
Okay, seriously, this is logic.

[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.960]
Why in the world would anybody be complaining about the fact

[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:39.820]
that we're getting off here?

[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:42.860]
I mean, the first few minutes I came on this morning and mentioned that about the Marling

[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:44.300]
is, oh, never gave the number out.

[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:45.360]
Phones are ringing off the hook.

[01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:47.360]
People very bitterly upset.

[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:49.380]
Why?

[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:53.900]
All of this week in our beautiful new studios here,

[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:58.040]
it's the same old, tired, just grading routine.

[01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:03.020]
We could bring in the encyclopedia Britannica and computers.

[01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:06.620]
We could bring in any piece of information ever known to the human race.

[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:10.580]
And these people, whether it was serious, whether it was amusing, whether it was in between,

[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.860]
whether it was titlating, thank you, Collagen, guys.

[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.400]
No matter what, it was, and they still have no response.

[01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:20.240]
And my friend from Toronto, I hate to break the news to you, but whether ate everything, eh?

[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:23.620]
Just move down here for a few months.

[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:25.360]
You'll find out whether isn't everything.

[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:30.380]
It's nice to walk outside, the sun is shining, the birds are chirping, the dogs are, you know, on the lawn.

[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:30.860]
That's nice.

[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:33.640]
But other than that, that's all we got.

[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:40.160]
Say vacuums, a vacuous place, the void of any kind of human sensibilities.

[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.520]
Here's North Miami-B, Chelo.

[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.100]
Here, you know, I thought the whole idea of radio, when it was first invented,

[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:48.380]
was just so we can discuss the dolphin draft.

[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:49.380]
That's right.

[01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:51.820]
That's what I thought it was for.

[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:53.860]
It is. That's what sports radio is all about.

[01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:55.400]
The dolphin draft and golf.

[01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:56.760]
You know, I find my...

[01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:57.180]
I really...

[01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:58.840]
I really love doing, by the way. How's his elders doing?

[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:04.320]
I listen to the sports show and I just realized people actually call in and they talk about their draft

[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:07.860]
And you notice the sports shows never have any shortage of calls

[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:11.020]
They got the same 200 people that call every sports are on his station

[01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:16.720]
They're lined up to talk about the same boring craft 24 hours a day about the nine-year-old kid in peoria with a great arm

[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:21.260]
That we hope to Marlon's side and they've been following him since elementary school and yada yada yada

[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:23.800]
A very young Florida Gator team click

[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.920]
No problem with calls on O-shows baby they have no ratings

[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:32.780]
But they got no a lot of colors which goes to show you that ratings and colors are like totally unrelated

[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:37.020]
Our problem is that this show is so far over the heads of the audience

[01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:39.480]
That's right this intellectual show of ours

[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:44.220]
You can't keep up with me. That's the problem if I would like come down to their level and

[01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:49.060]
Do in some kind of a gutter stupid show then maybe we could communicate on the same level

[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:56.620]
5 6 7 0 5 60 in fact, I'll tell you what let's set it off the joe and Dave right now. Let's put the ball game on early

[01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:01.660]
Because I'm totally there's I'm serious. I'm thoroughly fed up and disgusted here

[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:05.900]
It's almost the end of our fourth day inside. We're doing great. We got the coloring guys just left

[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:09.080]
We got a water cooler shut up. We got everything going here in the studio

[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:11.900]
We were arranging for a desk for our program director

[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:17.020]
We're taking the bull by the horns and doing our own stuff. We're getting free meals every day here like we always do

[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:18.680]
They're coming to us

[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:26.940]
But the audience we can't explain what they do you know in Texas with the last show what do they call it when they try to last

[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:32.260]
Who a cat whatever they call it that read next up a cowboy crap

[01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:38.660]
We're trying to last through the audience out there and we just can't corral them baby. We just can't get a hold of them

[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:41.880]
Maybe if I do another hundred years, maybe I can get it right

[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:44.880]
Here's my me Beach hello

[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:51.840]
Any I don't great listen my ever felt better sir. That's good. Mike Smith got to bring in a big strong defensive

[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:55.340]
Defension that's what we need we're going through a funk now, but it's better now

[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:58.200]
What difference would a defense make last night when you don't score any goals?

[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:02.560]
They scored one golegaer goal against Montreal one goal last night. How many games do you win scored one?

[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:07.220]
Well, we got a lot of his standing on his head. He's playing unbelievable and his team all of a sudden can't put it in the net

[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:11.680]
Well, we got to hope that this is gonna come back. Kathy will it says you got to be able to stick it in there, man

[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:14.320]
I mean, I don't think it's gonna disappear. I mean we had

[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.640]
Sporting all year. I don't think it's gone

[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:21.440]
I'm not panicking. It's just everybody's got to go through there a tough time air even the best look at the flyers 12 games without a win

[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:24.940]
All that talent with all that high-paid talent. What do you think of

[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:29.220]
Bringing in Wendell Clark again. No way. No, why not? No way

[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.400]
What what do we need him for?

[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:39.080]
Whenever he's in Toronto, he's a man. No way. It's a three-strikes in your house. I do still believe man. Okay. All right. I believe it

[01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:44.800]
So a little bit of that game last night. I wanted like up truck meals. I haven't even eaten yet. They'll be all right

[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:47.520]
Five second. I mean then of course you watch the Panther game

[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:50.800]
It's a good thing they're playing on the West Coast because boy that puts you in a real sleepy mood

[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:55.580]
It's watching about five minutes of the first period. Say I'm running right to bed put my head on a pillow. You're snoring

[01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:01.780]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 18. Where's Dr. Mark already get lost or what?

[01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:02.500]
huh

[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:09.520]
I'm gonna get important things to do here today if I you know just had a leisurely day here to Lolli gag around town

[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:12.140]
I could have gone over there to the beach and had him draw a lot of blood

[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:17.520]
But then this way it works out great because then he can suck out the blood with those big needles he brings over here

[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:20.160]
And then Jeff Cohen can bring in the food afterward

[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:25.900]
Have a little bit of a lunch. This is the way to operate. See the year minor leagueers were operating with here

[01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:30.100]
Talk about Marlon's baseball on a sports station. We're dealing with little leagueers here

[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:35.320]
Who's paying for the food? Oh God

[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:41.680]
Man I'm surrounded by amateurs man. She's mounted by amateurs

[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:47.720]
Spinalist people don't wonder they're all kissing the boss's ass these people aren't said like Ted Max amateur hour

[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:51.960]
Dr. Mark is on the road great. Well, what do you mean he's on the road? He could set a half an hour ago

[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.580]
He was leaving what do you mean he's on a road?

[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:58.300]
What like an omelette? He's on a road and there is a Gennies in a goddamn room

[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:00.700]
What

[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:06.540]
What do you mean you're taking care of what in the tea room you're taking care of?

[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:11.340]
I don't you know you don't look like they're type okay Sam. If I do you look like anybody's type?

[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:16.140]
Oh my god this Sam so help me god

[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:19.260]
You know I have several sick days that I haven't taken yet

[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:23.960]
And I've just come to accept it this part. What is that? It's that auto lock again

[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:28.660]
That piece of crap we got into that that great piece of garbage equipment

[01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:32.660]
That keeps screwing up all the time. Yeah, let's just play that break over again, okay?

[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:35.680]
For all those sponsors that get screw winding up in the ball games

[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:40.460]
They didn't buy the ball game. Yeah, I hate to break the news to you screw and people that bought live on the near Roger show

[01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:44.280]
Didn't buy Marlon's exhibition baseball. I know it sounds like bait and switch to a lot of us

[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:47.080]
Did I mention keep Sam out of here? I'm son of a bitch

[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:56.420]
You

[01:38:58.720 --> 01:38:58.880]
You

[01:38:58.880 --> 01:38:59.680]
John B Lapsey.

[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:05.300]
Hello,broading toaVit

[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:11.420]
toa clapping

[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:21.080]

[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:34.140]
I'm sad world for food. It'll take no play on a joke, Missile.

[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:39.000]
18 at 5.60 WQM almost done for the day, huh?

[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:41.060]
Oh, boy. Still haven't seen the doctor seeing him yet?

[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:41.920]
No. Jeff Cohen?

[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:42.800]
No. They'll be here.

[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:44.760]
Sam, are we seeing him?

[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:45.100]
Yes.

[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:49.080]
Oh, boy. Hey, Sam, we don't give stuff away on this show.

[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:50.380]
How many times have to tell you?

[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:53.720]
Okay. The way it works on this show is if there's free stuff, we get it.

[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:58.540]
See, the rest of the station, they can buy a loyalty from the audience.

[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:00.840]
Give it away a bunch of stupid tickets, stuff like that.

[01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:04.100]
I'm sure with all of that, we've our lives have been a hell of a lot better since I stand.

[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.420]
Thank you again to the caller who insisted back in November.

[01:40:06.620 --> 01:40:08.000]
Don't do that anymore. Thank you, sir.

[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:09.340]
That's where you got bless you.

[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:10.120]
Right.

[01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:19.900]
And by the way, speaking of callers, you know, I'm sitting here thinking during this break, you know, every now and then I am, you know, why is it up to realize that you got to like move forward, not backward.

[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:26.900]
And over the next, you know, between now and when I come back from the next vacation, which isn't that many weeks away, I'm like phasing out.

[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:30.020]
But more the callers are going to be like a rarity on this show, phasing them out.

[01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:35.120]
Because they, you know, after 100 years, they've run out of material, even though there's like new people out there, it makes no difference.

[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:42.520]
The town has run out of material and it's just, it's ponderous going through 600 phone calls to get to somebody that might have something to say.

[01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:43.140]
I don't need that.

[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:45.460]
So we're going to like phase it out.

[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:48.200]
And of course, thanks to the audience for getting ahead start.

[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:52.800]
There's in Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and today.

[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:53.780]
They're phasing it out.

[01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:55.720]
They must be psychic.

[01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:58.420]
Here's a mobile in Margate. Hello.

[01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:00.120]
Hey, how's it going?

[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.680]
Okay, sir. Bad phone. I can barely hear this call.

[01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:03.520]
Can you hear me now?

[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:04.640]
We're really weak.

[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:07.700]
I have a spy report for you from Mike Miller.

[01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:09.220]
Yeah.

[01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:11.260]
Yeah, I heard him up in Jacksonville.

[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:13.140]
Good place for him. Tell him to keep going.

[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:14.740]
God, it was, it was bad.

[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:16.740]
What happened that station up there?

[01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:18.500]
What station up where was?

[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:19.940]
I think it was the big ape.

[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:21.640]
The big ape?

[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:22.700]
I don't know.

[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:25.280]
I know that the worst of the grease man used to work there.

[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:28.560]
I don't know if it's about Jacksonville radio except that Steve Nichol is going to be on a station.

[01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:30.200]
They'll recall the same day so they better watch out.

[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:31.400]
Better Neil, everything down.

[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:36.340]
5 6 7 0 5 60, 0 5 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:37.660]
Where's Dr. Mark already?

[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:39.780]
Okay, he got a compass in a road map out there.

[01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:41.940]
I don't want to start getting pushy.

[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:44.460]
But he made the mistake of saying he was on a road.

[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:46.040]
I was like 20 minutes ago.

[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:49.120]
Oh, he's coming by way.

[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:49.920]
He must have come right up.

[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:50.540]
Colin's having him.

[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:52.200]
He wants to go by and see that old houseboat again.

[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:56.500]
Well, that's an interesting story about who really that German guy, the, oh boy.

[01:41:56.780 --> 01:42:01.160]
The guy with the bathhouse in Vegas and all these other strange people that were involved in that,

[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:04.800]
the Kunen and the, the, I say, bathhouse, boathouse in bathhouse.

[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:05.680]
Maybe that's what it was.

[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:06.360]
It wasn't the boathouse.

[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:07.200]
It was a bathhouse.

[01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:10.440]
It's not there anymore, Mark.

[01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:11.320]
I hate to break the news to you.

[01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:11.760]
It's not there.

[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:13.560]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:13.900]
Hello.

[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:15.240]
Hey, Neil.

[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:15.740]
Yes, sir.

[01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:19.100]
Listen, what, what makes you think that because of the,

[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:22.120]
you're in the new studio and all that.

[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:26.420]
I mean, us as audience, nobody in the audience knows the difference whether you're in a new

[01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:27.620]
or except for you saying it.

[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:27.900]
Yeah.

[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:33.080]
Why would, I mean, the audience is always, you know, you always have beg for the people to call.

[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:33.500]
Yeah.

[01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:35.320]
Just because you're in a new studio, it's not going to change.

[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:36.800]
Stop knocking yourself over the head.

[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:37.700]
Of course it's not.

[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:40.180]
But if something, it's something I'm not making myself so I feel great.

[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:41.660]
No, but for real.

[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:44.960]
And I hate, I hate, I hate your time to clock out earlier than it should.

[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.360]
You hate to worry about it.

[01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:49.300]
You know, I would hate you to clock out earlier than you should.

[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:50.280]
I'm clocking out right now.

[01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:53.900]
Where do I punch it?

[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:56.400]
That's just, I'm punching the time clock.

[01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:00.300]
I'm leaving right now because this guy, you know, he had a good point, whatever it was.

[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:06.460]
You see, the fact that we're excited about after all of these promises and after being down there,

[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:09.020]
like, step children being up here now, what are they?

[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:09.880]
And you're right.

[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:11.880]
There's nothing at all exciting about this, these rooms.

[01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:12.360]
Nothing.

[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:17.300]
In fact, quite to the contrary, what's very unexciting is the fact that some people,

[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:20.180]
you know what Sam reminds me of, he's like Andy from Hollywood.

[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:22.800]
Exactly.

[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:30.300]
No matter how many times you tell him you don't want to see him and go away and leave me alone,

[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:32.700]
the more you say that, the more he keeps coming back.

[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:38.740]
Why are you laughing?

[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:41.360]
I don't understand what you're, what you're, you're working about in there.

[01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:42.880]
I'm not joking.

[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:49.060]
If he had something specific, if he were working like the set or one thing or something that were involved and interested in,

[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:49.860]
that's fine.

[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:55.060]
He makes excuses to come in here to try to pretend to show what he's doing, something.

[01:43:55.300 --> 01:43:56.700]
We know he's not doing anything.

[01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:58.200]
Is he fooling us?

[01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:58.440]
No.

[01:43:58.540 --> 01:43:59.380]
He's fooling anybody.

[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:04.960]
The only reason that he's here is because he's a Greg's buddy and because the other guy's around here like getting free tickets from him.

[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:06.400]
That's all.

[01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:08.460]
It's not personal.

[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:09.780]
He may be a good guy.

[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:10.280]
I don't know.

[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:11.340]
I don't know him.

[01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:12.760]
I don't want to know him that well.

[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:15.420]
Like I said the other day, I don't want to go in there and talk to him.

[01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:17.800]
We saw him every once in a while.

[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:18.420]
That would be fine.

[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:21.540]
He's been in here by actual count 17 times already.

[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:22.900]
Today it's not even 12 30 yet.

[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:30.540]
And was there anything productive came out of any one of the 17 times?

[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:30.800]
No.

[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:35.320]
And the last time he comes in with this stupid giveaway thing that he might not,

[01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:37.480]
I look at the thing and I'm reading it's like idiotic.

[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:40.060]
And he says, oh, one, you're not concentrating.

[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:40.980]
I'll bring it back to Mark.

[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:41.780]
No, I'm concentrating.

[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:42.900]
I'm doing a show here.

[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:43.980]
I know that comes in the shot.

[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:44.660]
Can you say him?

[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:47.900]
See, so you're right.

[01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:49.660]
So you're at the very good call you just made.

[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:53.060]
Because now we've moved up to Greg Reed's playground.

[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:57.580]
We've joined all the kids with their sandboxes in the playground up here on the third floor.

[01:44:58.180 --> 01:44:58.500]
You're right.

[01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:01.300]
Here's Miami.

[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:01.640]
Hello.

[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:02.940]
Neil.

[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:03.400]
Yes, sir.

[01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:04.780]
Neil.

[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:05.960]
Yes?

[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:09.180]
How about you read his little passes from the Versace?

[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:10.380]
Here's my Miami.

[01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:10.660]
Hello.

[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:11.880]
He's such a big one.

[01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:12.460]
Okay.

[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:13.200]
Here we go.

[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:13.920]
Here's the last one.

[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:14.800]
Mobile in Tamarack.

[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:15.000]
Hello.

[01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:16.180]
Neil.

[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:16.620]
Yes, sir.

[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:19.280]
Yes, silicon is near death.

[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:21.280]
Says who?

[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:22.960]
There's channel seven just now.

[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:24.540]
Lewis silicon is near death.

[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:26.680]
Yeah, he's in sixth and January, they say.

[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:27.420]
Wow.

[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:29.720]
See, I told you it was a day for good news.

[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:32.440]
Even though the audience is in a coma, it's a great day for the Irish.

[01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:33.800]
Yeah, then you know what else happened yesterday.

[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:34.420]
What else?

[01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:37.840]
What else happened in that court case about that guy who shot that lady at the...

[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:39.520]
Yo, this is the guy with a fanny pack.

[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:40.200]
That's all.

[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:43.760]
Oh, I'd rather see Sam then talk to that guy.

[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:46.180]
That's the end of our calls for today.

[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:48.800]
Like I said, but we're going to face the calls out.

[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.020]
I think it was going to be quite this soon.

[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:50.480]
That's okay.

[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:51.480]
There's not a call on the board.

[01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:54.860]
See, just stop and think of the logic of you people.

[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:55.460]
Don't look at me.

[01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:57.360]
Just stop and think of the logic of those calls.

[01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:58.380]
We had the first half hour.

[01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:01.060]
All those people whining and whining.

[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:02.540]
Ah, Marlon's exhibition.

[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:05.740]
And here it's not even $12.30 yet.

[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:06.620]
And we're done for the day.

[01:46:06.780 --> 01:46:07.620]
I could go home right now.

[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:09.140]
We know what I'll offer in anybody's ass.

[01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:11.060]
Get the last commercial break in there.

[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:11.600]
They're done.

[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.260]
It's been nice seeing you again today, but that's it.

[01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:19.880]
$5.67, $0.560, $5.60 out of 18T wireless.

[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.620]
This really is an amazing place.

[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:23.540]
It's just astonishing.

[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:25.560]
There are no words to describe this area.

[01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:28.040]
We got...

[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:29.720]
I was looking at that thing they had the other day.

[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:31.460]
They had the four owners moving in.

[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:34.520]
Almost five million people now in Dave Broward and Palm Beach.

[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:36.200]
4.6 million people we got.

[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.320]
Does it really make a difference?

[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:39.620]
No.

[01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:41.300]
We could have ten million of these same people.

[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:42.040]
Would it make a difference?

[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:42.220]
No.

[01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:42.520]
No.

[01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:43.880]
I'd still be here doing the same thing.

[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:46.140]
And if all of them were listening, would it make a difference?

[01:46:46.180 --> 01:46:46.320]
No.

[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:49.340]
If I had a hundred here, it would make a difference.

[01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:52.020]
Here's a mobile in Weston.

[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:52.260]
Hello.

[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:53.980]
Neil, how are you doing?

[01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:54.520]
OK.

[01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:59.600]
Why can't we get people to hire competent people to drive buses?

[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:00.520]
For our children.

[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:02.720]
We have child molester.

[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:04.520]
They said, with all of our technology...

[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:06.100]
Nobody cares about that story.

[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:07.580]
Sir, you're the first one even in response.

[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:11.280]
Here's a guy that's got a criminal record involving children no less,

[01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:12.520]
misdemeanor child abuse.

[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:14.480]
He's driving a school bus in this town.

[01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:17.380]
And now he's doing candy little boy and molesting kids on a bus.

[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:18.560]
And nobody cares.

[01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:24.440]
I said, let's worry less about the Y2K problem and figure out how to stop these people

[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:26.380]
from getting into our school system.

[01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:27.280]
F&A, man.

[01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:28.320]
It's ridiculous.

[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:31.300]
And I don't hear anybody out there that's distraught about this.

[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:34.340]
That's running the school to pick their kids up because they wonder about these scumbags

[01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:35.540]
that are driving the school bus.

[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:36.560]
Nobody cares here.

[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:37.540]
That's why it goes on.

[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:38.980]
It's unbelievable.

[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:40.200]
And one more thing.

[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:42.320]
Keep the marlins off the radio.

[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:43.600]
You don't need them there.

[01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:44.140]
OK.

[01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:45.040]
Thank you.

[01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:45.900]
OK, see you.

[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:46.320]
I don't know.

[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:47.140]
He's getting a little nervous.

[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:48.700]
You want to know why?

[01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:50.240]
Because now it's getting closer to 12.50.

[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:54.720]
They probably think I was joking about having a ball game under the end of another one again tomorrow.

[01:47:55.020 --> 01:47:55.480]
Well, guess what?

[01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:55.940]
Surprise!

[01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:56.860]
Wrong!

[01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:00.420]
Marlins at the Orioles today and who they play.

[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:02.060]
Probably I don't know when I'm going to turn the page.

[01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:03.720]
Probably the same thing.

[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:04.840]
Same thing to see tomorrow.

[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:06.720]
They're about to come in as near the Orioles.

[01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:07.360]
Right?

[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:08.120]
See?

[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:09.180]
See this?

[01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:12.940]
Where is this doctor already?

[01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:13.940]
OK, where did he go?

[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:16.380]
Maybe he went to the Paxton Place.

[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:20.860]
Or maybe he stopped in to see the dental paper pushers.

[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:22.040]
Our good friends down on the second floor.

[01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:22.840]
I miss them.

[01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:23.280]
They're nice.

[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:24.560]
They turned out to be our good friends.

[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.200]
Too bad we don't have any good friends up here on the third floor.

[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:29.060]
It's a lucky guy on the other floor.

[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:32.080]
Along with me to blow up an abortion clinic.

[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.040]
I'll kill another doctor who was murdering a kid.

[01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:38.780]
If you speak with a jaw and have a bad attitude, then grab a mechanic.

[01:48:38.900 --> 01:48:42.280]
Guess you can burn one down to abortion clinic.

[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:42.820]
That is.

[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:45.960]
Ain't nothing like the smell of nurses on fire.

[01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:48.860]
Now if you drive a truck and wear a smelly hat,

[01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:51.540]
they don't know whether Jesus welcomed that.

[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:54.260]
And after we make a clinic explode,

[01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:57.060]
we'll go find a nigger and drag them down the road.

[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:00.040]
We'll be proud you're from the South Boy.

[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:02.360]
Double-wide, Southern Pride.

[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:05.540]
Now if there should be a woman trapped inside,

[01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:08.220]
we'll rape her in the ass and steal her first before she dies.

[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:10.840]
And paraphrase the Bible to valet, babe.

[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.740]
Our barbarism is now in deceiving hate.

[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:18.180]
In bread that is, fire up some garlic and garlic stew.

[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:22.160]
Now we are the Christian soldiers of God.

[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:24.740]
We like to wipe our ass with an old porn call.

[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.380]
And when we're not burning churches or clinics down,

[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:30.740]
we play our bandoes in the trees with penis in our mouth.

[01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:35.660]
That's what Christians require right there in the old brown eyes.

[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:40.940]
Pufferty 2 at 560 WQM just 18 minutes away from the big extravaganza there

[01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:42.240]
at Fort Lauderdale Stadium.

[01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:46.420]
We got 75,000 crazy old Cubans outside the stadium going.

[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:50.600]
I'm going to kill my niece, I'm going to kill her.

[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:14.040]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:14.060]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:14.060]

[01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:14.060]

[01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:14.060]

[01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:14.060]

[01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:14.060]

[01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:14.140]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:14.820]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:20.580]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:43.360]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:43.360]

[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:43.360]

[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:43.360]

[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:43.360]

[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:43.940]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:44.760]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:46.820]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:50.560]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:50:55.420 --> 01:51:04.380]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:04.600]

[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:04.600]

[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:04.620]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:04.620]

[01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:05.420]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:09.180]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:14.460]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:20.240]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:40.020]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:41.240]

[01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:41.240]

[01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:41.240]

[01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:41.240]

[01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:41.240]

[01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:42.280]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:43.480]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:44.760]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:49.240]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:49.700]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:51.880]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:53.660]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:54.600]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:54.960]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:55.800]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:55.980 --> 01:51:56.580]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:56.580 --> 01:51:58.180]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:58.180 --> 01:51:59.480]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:04.600]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:13.220]
I'm going to kill my little kids.

[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:18.340]
I'm going to kill my little kids,

[01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:21.260]
game in. He likes that. I'm sure you like that better than the patch

[01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:23.420]
Adam. That's a real shot, you know, because he doesn't

[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:26.380]
ever read no. It's not yet. I'll really keep up that drink

[01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:29.300]
in you. Well, he don't drink a little Italian wine. Huh?

[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:32.680]
Oh, look at that. He's got a, and I want you to, oh, look, he's,

[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:35.140]
there's, and the way that you realize how momentous this is.

[01:52:35.420 --> 01:52:37.240]
Wait a minute. I got to figure out where there you go.

[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.220]
You know, may I sit before you and speak? This is the first

[01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:44.600]
person to use our guest mic. See, now this audience that thinks

[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:47.480]
that I need to beg them for calls forever downstairs as you were

[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:49.820]
down there. You saw that crappy thing we had down to assistant

[01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:53.080]
to excited either, but we had not even a guest mic. But now we

[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:56.260]
have a guest mic. So surprise folks like a real radio station.

[01:52:56.380 --> 01:52:59.440]
Oh, yeah. Well, compared to where you work, you know, looks like

[01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:02.960]
mission control on the way in. What do you call it? Space age

[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:06.720]
yesterday. Now I want you to take every test that's ever been

[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:09.380]
invented. Well, I've looked at the

[01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:13.580]
compendium contains about 4,000 tests. Like I said, I can't afford

[01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:16.460]
that. So you know what I'm talking about? Now they have a test

[01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:18.640]
for Lupus, right? Sure. Because somebody mentioned that I want

[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:21.760]
anything that anybody's even mentioned. You think I got

[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:25.360]
Lupus? No. Oh, you think I have anything. And you'll notice that

[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:28.020]
where the rash used to be, which is almost not of it left, there's a

[01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:30.960]
nice scar from the, from the biopsy, right? We probably

[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:33.180]
last for a couple of months. Remember, I tell you that when I get a

[01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:35.620]
choice between doing something and not doing something, I recommend

[01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:38.580]
waiting to do a little more. That's right. That's right. Wait another

[01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:41.300]
six or seven years. And if you're still a lot of comedy, then we'll see

[01:53:41.300 --> 01:53:43.620]
we'll work it out. So can I tell you a few things? What's been

[01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:47.620]
going on? About what? Is this about your music? No. No. Oh, I thought it was

[01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:49.940]
going to start plugging in his music. You're here to be my doctor.

[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:52.780]
Yeah. This is about doctor stuff. Yeah. Yeah. First of all,

[01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:56.600]
there's a, there's a major insurance company that knows that

[01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:00.600]
we're friends. Yes. And wants to bid to you and your company here to

[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:04.580]
advertise their services using my name and your name. But I told

[01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:06.800]
them it since you and I have a personal relationship. I wanted to

[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:09.220]
discuss it with you first to make sure there was a way to work it out

[01:54:09.220 --> 01:54:12.680]
so that their business wouldn't interfere between me and you.

[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:16.760]
Like they said, and Godfather won when Marlon Brando was talking to

[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:19.880]
Celucso as long as your business doesn't interfere with my business, then we have no

[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:22.760]
problem. Whatever that. I don't even have any idea what you just said.

[01:54:22.860 --> 01:54:25.400]
We'll talk about it. All right. And then I'm applying for a federal

[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:28.800]
position as well. I wouldn't talk to you about that too because you've known me for

[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:31.600]
a while and your high profile guy here in South Florida. I want to apply for

[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:34.440]
for you direct a ship of what's called the Center for Primary Research.

[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:37.440]
You don't really care research in Washington. Yeah. Help help. Okay. Now,

[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:40.740]
where you go around to people and say you don't need me. Hopefully. Yeah.

[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:44.320]
Wouldn't it be nice if somebody from the federal government would come around and say

[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:47.380]
you don't need me. So in other words, you're leaving us? I don't know that for a

[01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:49.960]
fact. If you get to leave, well, you know, it's like the mating of

[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:52.780]
elephant. Then I'll have to go back to Dr. Prasgudnyak at the Cleveland Clinic and

[01:54:52.780 --> 01:54:55.900]
have him tell me how much he knows about it. Well, I'm just flattered that you even invited me back

[01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:58.800]
here. I thought you didn't love you. I didn't invite you back. I demanded that you come

[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:03.680]
back and do something. I didn't invite. I demanded. I heard you. You left me hanging

[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:06.780]
there in the wind. All you doctors, you leave us hanging in the wind. Not true in the

[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:10.100]
slightest. That's six or seven weeks. Have you? Have you? Have you been hearing about

[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:13.380]
the teeth thing? Have you heard about this? A little bit. This is what most of my

[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:17.200]
problem has been, according to my dentist, Dr. Jerry, by the way, the good guy.

[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:22.740]
And I've been grinding in my sleep, which causes the jaw and the neck and the

[01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:26.460]
pain behind the eyes. And that is all of these things. Yes. I had that several years ago.

[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:29.980]
I had I had a vision once I was eating a hot dog and a barbecue and I was leading up

[01:55:29.980 --> 01:55:34.080]
against the wall. And as I bit down on the hot dog, I had a vision of Zeus behind a cloud

[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:38.500]
throwing a lightning bolt at me and when it hit me, I'm serious. The pain was so

[01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:41.940]
bad my knees, but I had a vision of eating a bad, we need two once and I think that's what

[01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:45.920]
made me too right. But that's just so the neck and all of this stuff connected with

[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:49.220]
that. Now, now the Adelaide thing, do you think it's possible that I was allergic to that?

[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:53.240]
Yeah, certainly possible. I mean, you got to remember that. I don't think it's necessary.

[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:56.540]
And there's a lot of, by the way, the hydrochlorothylides on it. Blood pressure is much

[01:55:56.540 --> 01:55:59.540]
better on the hydra and it's much cheaper, too, by the way. Yes, it is. Like Kenny's a

[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:03.580]
teller. Right. Gladly. It does have that little metabolic problem. The triglycerides,

[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:07.340]
the cholesterol on the... But now the blood sugar has adjusted the head's coming back

[01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:11.260]
down. It's been great for like about two days. It takes about two or three weeks for your

[01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:15.260]
body to adapt to that. Three to six really. Like I said, three to six weeks. That's more like it.

[01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:20.380]
Yeah, I would say that's right. Okay. Yeah. So in other words, you don't need me. Is that what you're

[01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:25.380]
saying? No, but I look up in the, you know, I got one of the new little PDRs. You know,

[01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:29.380]
not the real expensive one. And I look up hydrochlorothylides and one of the side effects,

[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:33.680]
one of the rare side effects is kidney failure and I'm thinking... Oh! Like that. You know.

[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:37.820]
Yes. Any diuretic can cause kidney failure. And when you're diabetics, you're going to

[01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:41.220]
diuretic. Yes. kidney failure is something up on your mind, not something you're too

[01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:46.200]
crazy in any start. Because I've had like various, you know, aches and pains being

[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:50.060]
old. Is that what it is? Oh, I have. I've had like... I mean, anybody who knows you

[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:54.820]
knows you're not that old. You sound older, but not that old. Believe me, 56. I feel like 96

[01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:58.820]
the last three months. Hey, my family, I'm making a 56. You'll be happier there. So anyway,

[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:03.200]
this pattern is not fully diagnostic, but could represent mild sunburn reaction. Here's the...

[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:06.880]
You already got a copy of this from my... Yes, I did. By Ampsie? Yes, I did. I'm... I'm

[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:09.920]
raised. I'm raised in this air. But you know what I am trying. I've gone to... Yeah.

[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:13.680]
A whole bunch of different people to find out why I've been feeling so crappy and what the

[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:17.860]
rash was and all. And basically, everybody tells me the same thing. It's not this.

[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:21.000]
You know, other than my dentist who said it was that and he said,

[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:24.660]
and now I got away another two weeks almost for my amop guard. A couple years ago,

[01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:29.680]
I ran it. I had an op-ed and Harold. And it said that a person comes into the

[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:32.860]
doctor with a cold and gets a chest x-ray, which is really isn't a good thing to do.

[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:36.400]
And nice, they see a spot and it's questionable. Let me get a cat scan. Then they get a

[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:38.500]
thoracic biopsy when they've done this. They've done this. They've done a cold.

[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:42.460]
Yes. Oh, great. So you've got to take my blood. Okay. So you can hurry up and eat.

[01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:45.680]
Yeah. Okay. Now, I mean, you can finish what you're saying. No, I mean,

[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:50.500]
you're chasing this thing around, which is understandable. You know, actually... See,

[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:54.700]
you're the victim of a big picture. You've been educated like so many people to just keep going.

[01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:57.040]
Oh, you know what I mean? Something going. Seriously. Now you're a doctor.

[01:57:57.080 --> 01:58:02.840]
Yes. Okay. You've seen my body, which is rotiss. Okay. But I'm going to tell you,

[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:08.680]
you know, I'm going to take it. Now this is a man who's handling food. I just got you doing your spot

[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:12.860]
and giving you the rave reviews I always do for peace. He's not listening to me and there he's not paying any attention.

[01:58:13.940 --> 01:58:16.840]
I've eaten there. I like the place. You know, it is a great place. But this man...

[01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:20.980]
Why, if I wanted to see a firbol, I could bring an alcohol, see an orange germ,

[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:25.680]
I could bring them in here together. I was at the gym when you called by the gym. Oh my God.

[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:29.360]
You were doing the limbo rock under the stalls in the gym and you're the guy. Jeff, what's with the nails?

[01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:35.380]
Yeah, and he plus the green fingernails. Oh my God. And you're going to handle our food?

[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:40.920]
Oh. I'm sorry. You were saying what? You know, we've all been... You can sit on it.

[01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:44.140]
We have to look at him. We look at the appetite. No, we've all been real test.

[01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:47.560]
We've all been now educated to keep doing things when I keep saying it.

[01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:51.680]
And there's a lot of doctors who stand behind it. Do less is better than do more when you get an opportunity.

[01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:56.140]
Yeah. And my philosophy is do something. I know that's bothers you.

[01:58:56.280 --> 01:58:58.540]
No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. Because do something, please.

[01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:03.020]
If I tell you to wait, that's doing something. If you choose not...

[01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:05.580]
What is it? If you choose not to make a choice, you've made a choice.

[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:10.060]
But you know, if there's still part of the rash, is there? It is going away very slowly and I'm smearing stuff on it.

[01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:14.020]
This is the slowest going away thing in three months in the time.

[01:59:14.020 --> 01:59:16.920]
Oh, no. Talk to somebody who's got chronic fatigue for two to five years.

[01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:19.680]
Yeah. Talk about what takes a long time to go away. And we haven't solved that.

[01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:22.680]
So other words, what you're saying, I'm an impatient bastard is what you're saying and just...

[01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:25.380]
You know, maybe 25% of that's good.

[01:59:25.460 --> 01:59:27.400]
Yeah, I've done it. Which solved it.

[01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:31.320]
No, I don't call it an attention that hard.

[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:35.040]
No. But anyway, I mean, I understand who I concerned you are.

[01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:36.680]
But I'm like, if I do...

[01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:37.340]

[01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:37.620]
Yes.

[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:41.980]
Kidneys. These things. These are the things I'm concerned about. I have had variety.

[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:43.860]
And also where the gallbladder used to be.

[01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:44.880]
Yeah.

[01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:45.160]
What was that?

[01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:48.840]
Beautiful. Thank you, Jeff. And don't let me look at you. Please. Oh, God.

[01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:51.000]
We got brand new studio.

[01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:53.220]
It's not just pieces. Not right away.

[01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:54.380]
It'll make you do it.

[01:59:56.460 --> 01:59:56.820]
What?

[01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:01.540]
Well, I just got through reading your spot.

[02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:03.540]
It says you've got matsu pizza and matsu lasagna.

[02:00:03.540 --> 02:00:04.860]
Would you bring me? You brought me...

[02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:05.680]
What did you mean?

[02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:08.540]
Sausage and meatballs and expecting matsu pizza.

[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:10.080]
Jesus Christ.

[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:11.680]
That's okay. I'll leave the time.

[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:14.000]
I'll pass today because I'm on the same diet. He's on.

[02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:14.860]
Yeah, we're on the end.

[02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:16.320]
By the way, you have lost a lot of weight.

[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:17.980]
Yeah, I have. You know why?

[02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:19.480]
Because I gave up cigarettes.

[02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:22.840]
And Dr. By the way, who loves the egg and diet and is out of himself.

[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:26.160]
You know, on personal friends with Dr. Robert Atkins from New York.

[02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:26.820]
What are your names?

[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:27.640]
Rap and hour ones.

[02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:30.020]
If I'm going to name drops, I'm going to drop you on you.

[02:00:30.140 --> 02:00:30.680]
That's probably how you know. Only on Hank.

[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:32.080]
Yeah.

[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:33.320]
Yeah.

[02:00:33.740 --> 02:00:34.060]
And...

[02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:36.640]
No, anyway.

[02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:39.080]
I've always been an advocate of that diet.

[02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:39.540]
It's great.

[02:00:40.020 --> 02:00:41.100]
If you're still giving him stagoda.

[02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:42.900]
The thing is, it's not just sticking with it.

[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:45.540]
Because once you get in that party expression into the zone,

[02:00:45.540 --> 02:00:46.340]
I know that's another book.

[02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:47.740]
Not for me.

[02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:49.880]
No, no, no. But I wasn't talking about that diet.

[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:50.700]
That's what I call it.

[02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:51.600]
When I'm in the...

[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:54.540]
When I'm fully understanding and fully following it and into the habit of following it,

[02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:55.860]
the weight just melts right away.

[02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:56.100]
Really?

[02:00:56.240 --> 02:00:57.120]
And I don't even have to think about it.

[02:00:57.240 --> 02:00:58.000]
Yeah. It's what I'm at.

[02:00:58.040 --> 02:00:59.120]
Well, I have lost 14 pounds.

[02:00:59.240 --> 02:00:59.360]
Okay.

[02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:00.080]
My last...

[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:03.540]
When I stepped on your scale in December, whatever was about the 17th of December.

[02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:05.960]
Now, that's not phenomenal, but that's the start.

[02:01:07.020 --> 02:01:07.300]
Absolutely.

[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:11.100]
On the journey of 10,000 miles, start the first 10 pounds.

[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:12.980]
Well, see how you're the one that's being impatient.

[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:15.040]
Okay. I'm telling you about the rash going away and all this stuff.

[02:01:15.060 --> 02:01:16.120]
And you tell me it takes time.

[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:18.900]
And it's like, I didn't accumulate all the weight in five minutes either.

[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:19.960]
That's the way I feel about it.

[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:21.680]
So it took me 42 years to get work.

[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:21.820]
Right.

[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:23.860]
So take a lot of blood.

[02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:24.140]
Okay.

[02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:25.060]
And then we're going to do weightlabs.

[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:25.400]
Well, wait a minute.

[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:26.740]
We'll wait you before and after drawing.

[02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:27.900]
So you're going to do...

[02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:29.460]
I want the whole deal.

[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:29.960]
All right.

[02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:33.160]
What I'll do is I'll draw enough tubes to do everything.

[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:35.220]
And then we'll talk about exactly what it is I'm going to do afterwards.

[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:37.020]
Because, you know, I just want you to...

[02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:38.040]
You know, you're an educated customer.

[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:39.320]
And I want you to know what it is we're doing.

[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:42.620]
Well, the Italian business band came in last week.

[02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:43.460]
I've known him for 10 years.

[02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:44.900]
And he said, do everything.

[02:01:44.900 --> 02:01:47.160]
And when I did, and he got the billy, went crazy.

[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:50.660]
So I don't really want to do everything without informing what it is.

[02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:50.820]
Bill.

[02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:50.820]

[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:54.460]
Bill.

[02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:56.320]
No, I've been...

[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:57.240]
I've been mentioning that yesterday.

[02:01:57.380 --> 02:01:58.640]
The doctor we don't do for free.

[02:01:58.780 --> 02:02:00.620]
Everything else around here, we can include in the food.

[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:01.100]
You know what?

[02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:04.000]
I mean, I mean, I do come up here as a privilege.

[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:04.940]
So I...

[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:07.480]
I pass the laboratory charges to you, but I'm not even charging you for a month.

[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:08.120]
Well, I understand that.

[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:09.620]
And we've always been very good in the mother.

[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:11.820]
You don't do too much for me, but you've been very good about the charge.

[02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:32.960]
Well, I'm just...

[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:32.960]

[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:32.960]

[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:32.960]

[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:32.960]

[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:32.960]

[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:32.980]
I'm just...

[02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:33.280]
I'm just...

[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:33.320]
I'm just...

[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:33.380]
I'm just...

[02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:33.600]
I'm just...

[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:33.660]
I'm just...

[02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:33.660]

[02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:34.360]
I'm just...

[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:34.880]
I'm just...

[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:35.180]
I'm just...

[02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:35.280]
I'm just...

[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:35.500]
I'm just...

[02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:35.860]
I'm just...

[02:02:35.860 --> 02:02:35.880]
I'm just...

[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:35.880]

[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:35.920]
I'm just...

[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:37.840]
I'm just...

[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:38.080]
I'm just...

[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:38.080]

[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:38.080]

[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:38.220]
I'm just...

[02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:40.120]
I'm just...

[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:41.400]
I'm just...

[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:42.980]
That's one of them, you know, okay.

[02:02:43.420 --> 02:02:45.440]
It's in Miami, it's in Fort Lauderdale last time.

[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:45.700]
Okay.

[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.800]
We have the news press.

[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:49.600]
And I'm a big fan.

[02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:50.560]
Yeah, right.

[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:54.140]
I'm a big fan, but I don't listen to it on the radio because that's one of us before.

[02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:55.960]
If you've been such a big fan, go to the game.

[02:02:56.380 --> 02:02:57.660]
Yeah, especially an exhibition game.

[02:02:58.020 --> 02:03:01.260]
I went to a Yankee game against the twins.

[02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:01.700]
Yeah.

[02:03:02.740 --> 02:03:07.140]
And there are, there's people who have the paper they write about how the Yankees aren't here.

[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:08.300]
They got ripped off.

[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:10.800]
They only got one Yankee play and one guy, you know,

[02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:12.740]
Shilly Davis said, but it was the only regular.

[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:17.060]
Now, there was Shane Spencer, who they showed a lot on the World Series.

[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:18.900]
He was crying in mourning because he, you know, they...

[02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:20.120]
Okay, well listen, we got a bad connection.

[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:21.920]
So I'm a great day. Okay, this guy's killing me.

[02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:24.280]
Oh, God almighty, are you kidding me?

[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:26.800]
Now, I'm gonna tell you, you know me, I'm very good with Needle.

[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:28.020]
I've had plenty of blood taken all over.

[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:29.960]
You would have been a gassed if you saw the way they

[02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:31.120]
butchered me up at Cleveland Clinic.

[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:32.640]
I don't want to know what the girl's name was.

[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:36.360]
They butchered me a big time at the, I mean, left me a big,

[02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:38.040]
but it's all gone, so that's a good sign.

[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:39.660]
Well, if you'll pardon the expression,

[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:40.580]
it's the look of the draw.

[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:42.180]
I mean, it could happen to anybody.

[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:43.260]
No, no, not like this.

[02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:44.620]
This was, I mean, a lump.

[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.960]
The, you know, she was just a little stabbed.

[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:49.200]
I think she might have been anti-submitted or something.

[02:03:49.860 --> 02:03:50.760]
Just taken out of frustration.

[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:55.180]
But, I mean, but look at the number of bottle of vials you got.

[02:03:55.180 --> 02:03:57.040]
Well, I've never seen anything so vial of the synthesizer.

[02:03:57.360 --> 02:03:57.840]
Jeff naked in there.

[02:03:57.880 --> 02:03:59.040]
They're called vacuum trainers.

[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:00.440]
Yeah. You have a vacuum in them.

[02:04:00.660 --> 02:04:03.120]
So that if any of them are duds or I miss anything.

[02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:04.780]
I don't think there's enough blood in my body

[02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:06.220]
to fill all those goddamn things up.

[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:07.720]
Well, you'll be a little lightheaded when we're done,

[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:09.640]
but yeah, sure you'll be able to, I need a driver.

[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:10.100]
I'll help you.

[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:10.960]
Okay.

[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:12.560]
Okay, we're taking lots of blood.

[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:13.280]
Let's do it on the air.

[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:14.120]
On the air.

[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:15.520]
Yeah, let's do it on the air.

[02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:16.220]
All right.

[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:18.140]
I'm shutting that thing off.

[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:19.640]
Okay, come on over here in the stigma.

[02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:21.600]
I'm very head-plenty of blood taken.

[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:22.100]
No problem.

[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:24.020]
I'm not a pussy when it comes to that.

[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:26.380]
There's some guys that, some guys big macho guys,

[02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:29.520]
athletes, super jocks, see a needle they pass out.

[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:32.000]
2% of the population almost face them.

[02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:33.780]
Well, by the way, he's putting my arm on a conanin book.

[02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:35.280]
Guys, there's something symbolic about that.

[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:36.320]
It's on the new thing.

[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:37.420]
And since you're not that far,

[02:04:37.420 --> 02:04:38.380]
you're like right down the beach.

[02:04:38.380 --> 02:04:39.480]
You wouldn't be that shocked.

[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.740]
You'd be interested in some of the stuff that's in there.

[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:41.900]
Sure.

[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:43.640]
About the boat house and all that other good stuff.

[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:45.900]
And about the way the police botched the investigation.

[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:48.180]
And about the way the hero was totally on the outside,

[02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:49.360]
including Edna Buchanan.

[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:51.260]
Nice going Edna, my close personal friend.

[02:04:52.180 --> 02:04:52.760]
Here's Kendall.

[02:04:52.900 --> 02:04:53.060]
Hello.

[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:54.840]
Kendall.

[02:04:56.180 --> 02:04:56.780]
Going one.

[02:04:57.460 --> 02:04:58.180]
Going twice.

[02:04:59.140 --> 02:05:00.060]
It's probably all gone.

[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.160]
Let me, let me grab a line.

[02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:04.620]
Here's a mobile in his lap.

[02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:05.720]
And here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:06.060]
Hello.

[02:05:06.380 --> 02:05:06.620]
That's how.

[02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:07.620]
Now, I was a doctor.

[02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:08.660]
I'm just still in.

[02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:09.560]
The doctor's here.

[02:05:10.100 --> 02:05:10.420]
OK.

[02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:11.100]
A meal.

[02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:13.900]
Listen, two quick observations I want to ask you.

[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:14.300]
Yeah.

[02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:17.360]
Just play that little redneck bit a few minutes ago.

[02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:18.480]
Now, let me ask you something.

[02:05:18.620 --> 02:05:21.660]
Why is it that the grease may have got fired for making that reference?

[02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:25.380]
But you play that bit saying, flat out that drag niggers behind trucks.

[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:26.940]
The mobile is raising holy hell down here.

[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:28.120]
Because it was a sat there.

[02:05:28.180 --> 02:05:29.900]
And it's obvious it's a part of the sat there.

[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:33.540]
It's making fun of the people who did that and making them look like they asked.

[02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:35.020]
He was saying it himself.

[02:05:35.020 --> 02:05:36.260]
He was saying it himself.

[02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:38.100]
Yeah, but two things.

[02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:40.880]
He didn't say nigger, although he was referring to them.

[02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:44.480]
So what if he said no wonder they dragged darkies down?

[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:46.060]
What difference does it make what the word was?

[02:05:46.160 --> 02:05:47.680]
He was making fun of it.

[02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:48.460]
We're making fun.

[02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:50.200]
We're making fun of the people who did it.

[02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:52.160]
Yeah, I agree that you shouldn't have gotten fired for it.

[02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:54.220]
Are you listening to what I just said?

[02:05:54.340 --> 02:05:58.720]
I think we're taking a poke at the people who did it while the doctor is taking a poke in my arm.

[02:05:59.120 --> 02:05:59.280]
OK.

[02:05:59.620 --> 02:06:02.020]
Oh, painless.

[02:06:02.700 --> 02:06:04.900]
One more observation of our installations in this country.

[02:06:04.900 --> 02:06:05.360]
Yes.

[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:05.860]
OK.

[02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:06.800]
Why is it that?

[02:06:06.940 --> 02:06:08.200]
Now I'm not telling you about this somewhere.

[02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:09.000]
It's not going to be late.

[02:06:09.340 --> 02:06:13.420]
That asshole that killed those 20 people out in Italy a little while ago.

[02:06:13.860 --> 02:06:18.780]
Why is it that blacks in this country that they say that the white justice system in this country

[02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:20.800]
isn't in justice and they have to ride?

[02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:23.540]
But here's the asshole who flies like Tom Cruise and top gun.

[02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:26.300]
Kill 20 people and nobody's riding in Italy.

[02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:27.060]
How do you explain that?

[02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:30.480]
Because they got a better good controller out there on the street corners with the Uzi.

[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:31.080]
That's why.

[02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:31.840]
Take care, Neil.

[02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:32.220]
OK.

[02:06:32.220 --> 02:06:32.780]
OK.

[02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:33.780]
I got to hang up on the other side.

[02:06:33.780 --> 02:06:34.380]
How am I going to do this?

[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:35.100]
Ah!

[02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:36.300]
OK.

[02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:37.360]
You ready him?

[02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:38.660]
I don't mean get ready him.

[02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:39.440]
We got to cut him off.

[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:40.020]
OK.

[02:06:40.060 --> 02:06:41.840]
I'm sitting here doing a show with a needle in my arm.

[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:45.480]
And you had a little tough time because I've got very invisible veins.

[02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:48.900]
You had a real tough time finding my veins.

[02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:50.860]
I do it by braille anyway.

[02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:51.260]
Yeah.

[02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:51.740]
I noticed.

[02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:52.860]
So anyway.

[02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:54.140]
And he said, you don't need me.

[02:06:54.320 --> 02:06:54.700]
You'll be OK.

[02:06:55.160 --> 02:06:56.460]
So that's pretty much going to do it.

[02:06:56.500 --> 02:06:57.080]
I'll tell you one thing.

[02:06:57.120 --> 02:07:00.000]
If you get all the lines up real quick, we might reconsider and not join the ball game.

[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:01.620]
Let's see how this works.

[02:07:01.940 --> 02:07:01.940]

[02:07:02.300 --> 02:07:03.660]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:04.760]
0, 5, 60.

[02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:06.000]
On the AT&T wireless line.

[02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:08.900]
If everybody called, we got like, what, 15, 20 seconds.

[02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:11.860]
If we get air be line on the board, lid by that point.

[02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:14.460]
We might just not run the ball game.

[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:15.240]
We'll keep the show going.

[02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:15.520]
OK.

[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:16.000]
It's up to you.

[02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:18.180]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:19.100]
No lines, lid yet.

[02:07:19.880 --> 02:07:22.020]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:23.080]
Pound.

[02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:24.460]
I got like, what, four lines, lid.

[02:07:25.220 --> 02:07:26.100]
Pound, 5, 60.

[02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:27.620]
On the AT&T wireless line.

[02:07:27.700 --> 02:07:27.820]
Come on.

[02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:27.860]
Come on.

[02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:28.220]
Time to go.

[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:28.820]
Two seconds.

[02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:30.280]
God dammit.
