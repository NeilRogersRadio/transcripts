[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]
Sport Radio 560W QAM Miami Ford Lauderdale presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.780]
To talk to Neil called 560560...

[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.460]
What's the need for you to hear it?

[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.820]
4.560 on your cell phone.

[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.620]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or...

[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.620]
Anyone else on the show do not necessarily reflect those of WQAM easily read acquisitions

[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.380]
or the Beasley Broadcast Group.

[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.680]
Now, Neil Rogers on Sport Radio 560 QAM...

[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.440]
How it places the lotion in the back.

[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.960]
Have you ever turned on the radio and said, that song makes me sick?

[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.820]
Well, now, KO Peck take records presents...

[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.020]
Songs that make you wanna throw up.

[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.800]
The dogs are gonna up chuckle you, I gotta...

[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.680]
And chase the feeling you...

[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.520]
And I'm gonna run away from my heart, like I...

[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.980]
As on songs that make you wanna throw up, you get...

[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.240]
...king.

[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.260]
...sufferable, useless, useless...

[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.940]
...like a complete barceron.

[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.040]
And who could forget that classic?

[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:14.100]
...cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, you know you make me want a bar.

[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.800]
This is my grocery bar, blow my child now, put my tooltie bar, chuck my new dog up, keep on human.

[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.500]
You can chew the puke, times that make you wanna throw up.

[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.380]
Make me fly, fly, see you then!

[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.940]
Well, the dog almost died, and that's ghostly, try and beat a toe for breakfast today.

[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.300]
He started to foam, and he started to mow, and his eyes rolled around in his brain.

[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.500]
So I came into work, and the deal was some jerks all these mung brains were causing me pain.

[00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.300]
My army was chronic, all of the ill-catted tonic, and Palm Beach had proper brains.

[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.040]
Thank you.

[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.980]
Hey, my dog's gonna be okay, there you go.

[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.780]
He's pulled out okay, I'll write to give him a shot, a little shot in the head, and he's okay.

[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:15.840]
I threatened him, I said hey, if you don't come out of this and stop all over the house, you're going back there, and you're gonna stay in the cage, you said okay, and he cut it out.

[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.600]
So everything's okay, I know that a lot of people take a note out there.

[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.860]
10 out of 2 at 5.50 WQ, I'm happy Thursday to you.

[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:31.060]
Well, take a look at the hero this morning, and they should tell you everything you should need to know about Mickey Erison and Tony Ritter, and the Night Ritter People, and the incestuous relationship.

[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.160]
What do we've been telling you, back when they were doing that thing, and pulling the wool over the public signs about the arena?

[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:57.380]
The American Airlines, it didn't burn down Arena, and the Ritter People, Tony Ritter, was in their fightin' with Mickey Erison, and I'm not fighting with him, but I mean, in bed with him to put that thing over in the public, that they waited back with to make sure it would get through, because they want one-Herald Plans to be worth about $20 billion, and they really believe in their wisdom that downtown Miami's really gonna make a big comeback thanks to that American Airlines Arena.

[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:07.480]
So here we are at the front, and did you see this? Look at this. The front page of the Herald, here's the impeachment of the President. The trial on the Senate begins today. Is that the important story in the Herald?

[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:16.320]
No. The whole top half, even more than half a page, is NBA finds way to play. That's the Herald's important story of the day. How do you like that?

[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.520]
See, the Herald for years, they promote anything that they're interested in, that they have a vested interest that they like.

[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.820]
They're not too crazy about hockey, so the coverage in their very minimal non-existent. Like Harnessed Racing, Poppato Park, I remember Alan Finkelson years ago telling me,

[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.100]
oh, you know, I'm a real promotion guy, I'm gonna get the Herald to come around. Did he ever tell the day he went to his grave? Did they ever come around? No.

[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.960]
No. They give nothing there. If they're not interested in it, they will give you absolutely nothing. That's the Miami Herald for you.

[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.460]
So in their mind, the big story, and let me say to you, because I got a great facts about this NBA business, which I will read by the way.

[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.480]
A wonderful facts. If I can get like two facts like this every day, we could do 20 hours.

[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.640]
But then we get those sports nerds upset. So anybody will get to the facts in a minute about this whole NBA thing.

[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.180]
And I stand by what I said virtually nobody cares that the NBA, they were showing people on the fan in New York.

[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.400]
There were showing clips from the talk shows on the network news last night of people calling in.

[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.940]
And all the people that I heard, and of course it was selective. I'm sure of it, but all the people I heard were saying,

[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.560]
hey, we were sitting ticket holders, but are we going to go? We're not going to go. We were sick and tired of it. We can't take it anymore.

[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.800]
I mean, the idea of saying Patrick, the National Baboon Association, I'm sorry, seeing Patrick Ewing on there talking about, well, you know, we didn't lose a lot of money.

[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:37.340]
Don't you feel for these guys that they actually lost some money because they didn't be playing some of those games that are making 18 and 20 million dollars a year.

[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.580]
They're walking around with their 50 million dollar A-rings hanging from each year. And how come they got one and they're right here, by the way.

[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.700]
What's that all about? We're supposed to be a full sorry for this crack.

[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.240]
But anyway, there it is on the front page. The Harold people will tell you this is the most important thing in the whole of God damn world.

[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.840]
Also, a Broward team accused of raping half-sister eight. And of course, this is like the Ronnie Zamore thing all over again.

[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:13.300]
This is because they saw an episode of Jerry Springer and these two kids age 15 and 13, the two brothers decided, well, we'll rape the crap out of our eight-year-old sister over and over again because it looked good on Jerry Springer.

[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.360]
Incess is best. Does anybody believe that? No. We'll talk about that.

[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.100]
WQM reaches a deal with U of M, tentative deal, three-year deal. UM football, basketball, baseball, anybody interested? No.

[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.400]
Are we going to make any money on that? No. Is there going to be a lot of work and a lot of effort and a lot of time? See, this is Greg Reads' concept.

[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:44.360]
Pretty simple. Carry the medidores. We're going to be carrying a goddamn arena football arena indoor soccer. You name it. If there's tidally-wanks tournaments out there, if it's a sport, it'll be here on QWM 25 hours a day just on and on and on. See, IOD learned their lesson with UM.

[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:52.520]
They learned it a long time ago, which is why they won, eventually won up on IMD. There's no money to be made on UM sports. There's minimal interest.

[00:05:52.520 --> 00:06:00.440]
In fact, here they played St. John's in basketball last night ranked number 10 in the country and beat him by the way. I saw about 30 seconds of that. Was there anybody there? No.

[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:07.060]
4,000 people in the Miami arena. The CEO, UM play one of the top ranked teams in the country and beat him no less. And there's still no interest.

[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:16.280]
So he can put all of that in as far as ratings. I mean, if nobody shows up in the venue itself, what does that tell you about how many people potentially might be listening?

[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:24.100]
I mean, I broadcast you in baseball for six years on WS News many, many years ago and it was a lot of fun doing it. But was there anybody really listening? No. No. No. No.

[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:30.300]
There's nobody that ever show up in a rating. Did UM football even ever show up in a ratings back in their heyday when they were packing the orange ball? No. No.

[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:44.280]
Never made a blip on the Richter scale. On the Mike Richter scale. Never made a blip. By the way, the Panthers tied last night to 2. I get up this morning. It was 1-0. And my tape was running. I get up this morning and I fast forwarded and I thought it was the end of the game and it was 2-0 in Colorado.

[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:57.520]
And I thought damn it. They got shut out. And I'm driving to work and I hear Geltie say because yes, I did hear Geltie. How do you like that? I heard him say it was a 2-2 tie which it was. Panther scored right at the end of their melon. Be tied it up with the extra attacker on at the end of the game. Nice going there boys.

[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:07.740]
Really ties better than a loss. And speaking of Geltie and I do I am going to give you my piece today. I'm saying my final piece about Rick and Suds. OK. And I do mean final piece.

[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:21.160]
Now, Stalzer has a funny way of affecting your brain. You know what? A lot of people we like to live in the past. We like to reminisce and we like to remember the good old days when things were however they were. And usually when we remember them, they seem a hell of a lot better than they really were.

[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.100]
You know what I'm talking about? I'm sure you do. Well, by the way, there's how many cuts on here?

[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:36.340]
What the f*** is wrong with the bag? It rubs the lotion on its skin. It does this whenever it's told. Yeah. It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.

[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:57.860]
Get the hose again. Of course, we're used to getting the hose over here, but that's already a four. OK. So I'll get to my important facts. Also, I got another book which you must I know you don't want to hear too much about this. Not going to understand. Very boring.

[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:13.600]
The super anti-oxidants by Dr. James F. Bouch B. A L C H in just two weeks. This is made an amazing difference in my life. The likes of which you can't even begin to believe in 99 and 9th 10th percent of you'll say, yeah, sure. Fat. So we believe you. And that's fine. I don't care.

[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:23.300]
I do not care if you believe me or not, but there'll be like maybe a half a dozen people out there say, she sounds pretty interesting when I tell you about the stuff in this book, which I'll get to later very briefly. Don't get panicky.

[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:31.080]
He's back on that health and nutrition ticket again. God damn it. We can't stand it. We'd rather hear about the stock market, which is taking a big.

[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:41.100]
Oh, too late for that. They're showing you the 10th. I'm going to give you a whole run on that. So I've got about the 5,000 things to do today. And that'll go. That's going to include this facts. I love this facts.

[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.180]
Thank you very much. Jerry. Great facts.

[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:51.820]
So the cut for Saturday, November 29, 1997, King. I'm coming this fall with the NBA on NBC.

[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:58.340]
Well, you'll see guys who make more money in 10 minutes than you'll make in a lifetime. It's morning versus my tumble.

[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:05.680]
What the thing they have to do is I make over $60,000 every time I take it. That's a maybe true.

[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:12.900]
I'm going to do a lot of. But I make over a million dollars for every people on your big black really tall black guys who make a

[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:19.520]
load of money. The NBA on NBC. All right. They're happy as a hero. Maybe are they happy?

[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:26.740]
12 minutes after 10, 5, 60 WQM. Hank Goldberg at two with the Jimmy Johnson show at five. Then we got the they old redhead.

[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.720]
I thought he was the orange head. I heard depot say he's the redhead.

[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:37.640]
Boobshambi ever seen him and red barber together. And then 10 o'clock we got a cap. No games tonight. I will change that soon.

[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:45.460]
So anyway, getting back to this Rick and said something. You know, I had that soft spot in my heart. Even the most people think that I'm a hard-hearted son of a bitch, which I'm not really.

[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.660]
And these guys we heard that story, which is a true story by the way about how bold you call them into blow them out and tell them they weren't going to be renewed.

[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:57.540]
And then Rick, you know, salvaged their job and weaseled his way back into the morning show and a much reduced salary, whatever it was.

[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:05.220]
Okay, fine. I'm all for the town. I'm all for those guys. But, but what is today? Thursday. So that means I give them four days.

[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:13.500]
And I get in the car this morning to come to work. I turn on our radio. What is the first thing? See, suds. I love suds. Suds is funny in his own way.

[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:21.120]
As he is a wimp, you're right about that. He is a wimp. He's under Rick's tone and is making a very embarrassing minimum amount of money, which if you knew you'd be, you'd be astonished.

[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.960]
But nevertheless, he's an underling. Some people play that role in life. They're just always the underling.

[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:36.600]
He's a good guy and he's amusing in his own way very often. But Rick is a hard ass. You can't tell him anything. He will not listen. In fact, the more you tell him one thing, he's like a stubborn, like my little dog.

[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:43.420]
The more you tell him one thing, the more he'll run in the opposite direction. So I get in the car this morning. I turn it on. And what's he talking about?

[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:48.460]
Oh, well, the market, of course, the market is taking another drop today. After yesterday's big day, it'll all go away.

[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:55.420]
Whatever game yesterday, it'll be because it's a game. But he's going on about, well, it's a good time to maybe get panicky and butterbeam.

[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:04.520]
And I'm thinking, are we going to go through this again today? Again, we're doing this. Rick Rally sharing his expertise with a stock market.

[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:16.120]
You know, on the one hand beer is good for you. You know, beer is good. I like Chinese. You know, that's the rate of the schmalt. That's what they do. That kind of trailer park mentality. That's the whole stick.

[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:27.460]
Ted, you know, but on the other hand, it's this obsession with a stock market. I'm going to tell you my button went so fast. Actually back over to hear for a few minutes. And then I said, well, I don't want to get carried away.

[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:38.800]
Because I'm just not going to be sports nerds. I can't deal with that. But I will never listen to the Rick and Ted show again. I did get in a lot of promotion, a lot of publicity, a lot of the people who listen to them from the old IOD days listen to the show.

[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:47.640]
And so don't blame me for not turning people on the fact of where they are and when they're on. I did nice service for them. Absolutely free. But am I going to be listening? No. Because I just I can't deal with it.

[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:57.100]
I cannot deal with it. I've listening to Rick Riley talk about the stock market. Any more than when he's got on that Jag about the computers. Remember when he first started with that crap.

[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:09.280]
At least a couple people can relate to that. But it's boring. I mean, everybody's got a computer and most of us use it. Some people use it. Lots of people for whatever. But, but what is there to talk about?

[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:27.320]
Although I will say this. I mean, everybody's got a toilet bowl, but not everybody's got a brand new seat. In fact, Guinness Book of Records on the, just listed. That's the beginning of the new year. Neil Roger strikes again. Only talk show host in the history of radio to be brought a brand new toilet seat while on the year.

[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:34.160]
Number one and number two. The only toy on a talk show host in the history of broadcasting to it to fest up to a bruised rectum on the year.

[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:49.000]
There you go. Two listings in the Guinness Book of Records already. And it's only January 7th. So Rick inside that way she luck, but you'll have to do without me, which I'm sure they don't care one way or the other, but I will not be listening. In fact, you know what I discovered because I have no CDs in the car at the moment.

[00:12:49.940 --> 00:13:01.360]
And you know what was fantastic like the last 20 minutes of my ride to work this morning. The sounds of silence. Oh God. Turned it in the off position. I thought God, I feel better now. Like when that pain stops man.

[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:16.840]
Wow. I feel fantastic. So at any rate, we got this facts, which I'll get in because it ties into the NBA thing and a lot of stuff that's going on. And I'm always accused of being a racist because there's some people out there who can't be handling the truth. Okay.

[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:28.220]
Neil, whenever you do a show, you should want to be as accurate as possible. Why should I want to be accurate? It's a talk show, dummy. Who the hell ever said anything is accurate? How the newspaper is accurate? So why should I be accurate?

[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:58.180]
Well, you said that no one underlined. No one cares about the NBA. You are wrong. I stand by. You see anybody on a phone who cares about the NBA? No. No. I'm talking about the fans. I mean, obviously the players in the owners, they care. These really back to these freaks of nature. They care. And they came to the yesterday. Of course they care. That's why they came then because they don't want to miss their 15 and 18 and 20 million dollars a year. They're for playing a stupid game. Well, I can't believe we were going back to work. I can't believe it. Oh, yeah. That's great.

[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:22.720]
The fact is, I'm going to say what you should say what you should say is you don't care. I care CBS, Wamy and others do care. Wamy expects the ratings of the NBA to be much higher than the ratings you gave them. You are racist. Anyone listening to you talk about black people can't be happy. Well, I sure hope they produce the NBA games, the heat games on there. Better than they produce Neil at night. I'll tell you that.

[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:36.320]
Like maybe you'll be actually able to see the picture and hear the audio on there. That would be a start. Maddie. Maybe Maddie wrote this fact. You are racist. Anyone listening to you talk about black people can't be happy.

[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:49.700]
Now, can we follow that again? Anyone listening to you talk about black people can't be happy. There are a few black people you admit to liking. Look at Oprah. Misspelled by the way. There's an H on the end dummy.

[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:58.500]
She is lost weight maintained it and looks a lot better than you do. Does Oprah look better than me? No. Does she look better than I'll see the board and cow? No.

[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:15.840]
And as far as maintaining weight, she's up and down like an accordion. She's an admitted binge eater who sits in these. If you ever read those articles in the tabloid, then of course she says that she tells them this stuff about eating bags and bags of like just going off in a quarter and just gorging on enormous amounts of of crap.

[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:26.940]
One week she weighs 40 pounds. The next week she weighs 400 pounds. She's a human accordion. She is lost weight maintained it looks a lot better than you do. She's a financial wizard.

[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:39.460]
Yet still you are jealous that she has high ratings. People do like her. Not jealous. I would like to have her money. Yes, but I'm not jealous. It's just astonishing to me in depressing that there are people who are like follow her like sheep, especially the housewives of America.

[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:47.900]
Oprah reads some stupid therapy book. Now all of a sudden 100,000 stupid women go out and buy the same stupid therapy book because Oprah is reading.

[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:57.700]
You are saying that you don't care if no one talks or writes about you and your charity. Well, you do care. See, this is a guy who not only tells me what I should say, but also tells me what I care about.

[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:03.880]
If you didn't care, you wouldn't bring it up daily. I've never heard of a stupid person being a multi-millionaire signed jury.

[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:16.300]
Never heard of a stupid person like Ted Turner, for example, being a multi-millionaire. There are a lot of multi-millionaire. How about the Glenn Turner? Remember him? Dare to be great? How about Buddy Bud Paxon? How about all the Jocks?

[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:21.340]
Yeah, there you go. Well, they be smart. Don't they be smart? Yeah, come on. They be geniuses.

[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:35.480]
Artists, musicians. Never heard of a stupid person. In fact, if this guy heard of this, this is obviously one of the sports nerds that listen to this radio station. If you hear some of the interviews with these Jocks on this radio station, I mean stupid would be a compliment for some of these bulls-os, okay?

[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.740]
But let's take the part about first of all, caring about the NBA.

[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:52.200]
First, let me just say this to you. If it weren't because I'm assuming that whoever wrote this, all of them I really don't know. I'm assuming that if they're a black person. Would you agree with that? This is probably somebody that are complicated to wrote this? More likely than that.

[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:57.100]
More likely than not. Very good. Well put. Diplomatically put. Like I said, it's much harder. Wrote this facts.

[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:08.480]
Well, let me say this to you. My dark, complex, and friend. If it weren't for all the white people in their business suits going to the heat games and subsidizing the Miami Heat, there wouldn't be any Miami Heat.

[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:23.000]
Because most black people in this town, unfortunately for them, don't have the finances. They don't have the disposable dollars to be able to afford the high prices of those tickets to see any of the sporting events.

[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:40.760]
You can go to the dolphin games that I did for five years. You can go to the Panther Games that I do every home game. You can go to the heat games which I don't, but I do see them on TV for a few minutes here and a few minutes there. And you'll see 99 and 910% of the people at those sporting events are white people who are subsidizing those events.

[00:17:44.320 --> 00:18:00.380]
Including by the way of the heat, all those business guys with their cell phones, those plastic guys with their white shirts and their, you know, their business suits on sitting there and well, you know, pretending to pay attention with the thousands of empty seats around them and then leaving like a midway in the third quarter, whenever they get around it would okay.

[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:02.940]
Because they really don't care.

[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:11.160]
So this was even even when the heat has had tremendous seasons which they have had last couple years, there's still a thousands of empty seats.

[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:23.540]
And it's not only the heat they showed, they showed the, like I said, talk to us from the fan in New York and call and shows all over the country on the newscast last night. And maybe it's a conspiracy by the honky media. Maybe that's it.

[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:30.180]
But the majority of the people that they talk to, they couldn't give a crap less. They're sick and tired of it of subsidizing illiterate dumb people.

[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:38.220]
Seven foot freaks, the jambaball down to the, you know, a 10 foot basket. What talent that takes, huh? The National Baboon Association.

[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:49.540]
And as far as being racist is concerned, hey, I'm not any more or less racist than anybody else. I just admit to my true feelings. Okay. I like nice people. I also am not too fond of really, really dumb people.

[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:59.100]
I mean, there's some dumb people who are, you know, nice people. That's okay. You know, I expect everybody to be a rocket scientist. But I'm talking about people who are so dumb that they're just that they're embarrassing.

[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:13.280]
They're dangerous, especially because they're reproducing. But I got good news for you, especially with the story about the kids raping the sister in the a jury spinger. The good news is that they just announced from Washington last night. Maybe it made me jury miss the story.

[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:20.260]
But all professional athletes, all collegiate athletes and all people who live in trailer parks are going to be sterilized.

[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:29.240]
1999 just before the end of the before the millennium. How do you like that? So maybe one won't have such a Y2K problem anymore, huh?

[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.080]
We're going to be sterilizing everybody who lives in a trailer park and all college and professional athletes.

[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:46.220]
Which is in the state that all athletes are more on, but you know, every now and then you got to make a sacrifice because the generally speaking, this is probably, you know, being a little on a conservative side here, probably airing on a side of safety is a good way to go.

[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:54.940]
So that we don't have more runs reproducing. And of course, we find out that most of these athletes are not most, but a great many of them who are reproducing. They're not married anyway.

[00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:06.480]
Who's the one guy? Who the hell's the one jock that's got like, is it a boxer? Who the hell is it? That's got children by about a half a dozen different women, none of whom are he married to, by the way.

[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:15.340]
Who is that? Do you remember? You don't think George Foreman or you? No, no, not George Foreman. He's got the lean mean grilling machines. I love George Foreman. See, there's another black guy like I love George Foreman.

[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.700]
I'm at even by me of lean mean grilling machine. I think George Foreman's great. Huh? He's no rocket scientist, but I think he's funny. He's a good guy.

[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:34.080]
I like the lean mean grill machine. What are you laughing about? I watched that when that information comes on. I sit there and watch the whole guy the same thing. I love it. I think he's he's better in Ron Popeel. He's more entertaining.

[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:49.800]
And he got up him, huh? What? Sean Kim. No, not Sean Kim. Come on. Somebody out there come up with it. Help us out. Okay. I'm not one of these sports nerds that got that expertise. I even thought the Tennessee quarterback was a white guy to show how much of that game I watched, which is about 20 seconds.

[00:20:49.800 --> 00:21:03.500]
I mean, what's I want to watch in that game? Of course not. Are you thinking about a vendor? Holy field. Hey, Vander Holyfield. That's the one. He's got kids by all over here and over there. And she's got. Yeah. And it's supposed to be like a blessing like a missby that we got dumb illiterate people.

[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:13.540]
Making all kinds of babies, but women that they're not married to have no commitment to. Next thing, you know, I mean, they're talking about bubble for Christ. Next thing, you know, Bill Cosby's going to be a father in kids out of wedlock.

[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:22.920]
And he's black too. How do you like that? So like I said, this bull crap about and this business about anybody listening to you talk about black people can't be happy. Well, what does that mean?

[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:31.040]
If there's anybody, I don't talk about black people as a group. I may talk about specific people about specific smarts or specific white people.

[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:40.520]
People are people. There's black people are brilliant. They're black people who are dumb. They're black people who are great people. They're black people who are scumbags. Just like there's white people in the same category.

[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:55.260]
But the fact is that we also have a class of people and there seems to be an inordinate amount of crime, for example, inordinate amount of drug dealing that goes on in black neighborhoods. And of course, giving the song a dance about poverty and about this.

[00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:01.420]
Well, you know, something there's a lot of people live in poverty. They don't all go in the rob stores and kill people and deal drugs on street corners.

[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:12.180]
But you know, so anyway, anybody I'd like to find out if the people who are listening to this show are unhappy. It says they can't be happy. I must say the whole audience has got to be unhappy then.

[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:19.600]
Maybe that's the problem. Maybe this entire audience is unhappy because it says anyone listening you talk about black people can't be happy.

[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:26.560]
What do I be saying about black people that makes people unhappy? That's what I would like to know. Jerry or whatever your real name is.

[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:35.000]
Maddie. And as far as whammy is concerned and all that, you know, anybody can throw a ball game on anybody like this station with a dolphins.

[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:42.620]
Anybody can go and pay a lot of money to get the rights and throw a ball game on. And however many people are interested in it will tune in or watch or listen or whatever both of the above.

[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:52.420]
Well, what skill does that take? What does that have to do with anything as opposed to producing a show properly and putting together and promoting it so that somebody might find it interesting and watch.

[00:22:53.900 --> 00:23:00.920]
Wasn't just Neil at night that was a bomb on whammy. Every goddamn show they put on it was a bomb on whammy. So at least we were consistent anyway. Jerry.

[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:11.560]
5 6 7 0 5 60. Let's find out number one. All the people who are excited about the NBA because Jerry says that I'm the only one that's only me who doesn't care.

[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.240]
Everybody else is fired up and pissed off and excited. The NBA is coming back and they are going to play a few games.

[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:23.540]
And number two, the people are on happy because I'm a racist. Let's hear from them for starters. 5 6 7 0 5 60.

[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.940]
5 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.820]
Floridians done after.

[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:37.120]
All right, Lane. Gather around. The man is ready on the count of three. One, two, three.

[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:45.920]
The grassy course and wind. The bars will be all the way. We are angry.

[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:51.560]
Thikes to battle. Those who are anti-gay.

[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:58.040]
Sure, careful. Well, well, we'll start. We'll be stuck on our rubber.

[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:06.660]
We declared to all old people, women that we know can in our games.

[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:14.200]
Our houses are all homing. Our factories are going.

[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:21.120]
We make our choices early as the group will push over.

[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:27.420]
And we say to you, we come against the subject.

[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:36.980]
We will gather to name our sing-gun for the millions of miles.

[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.460]
Excuse me, soldier. Are you from Rotor-Rooter or just happy to say me?

[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:46.520]
10 30 at 5 60 WQM. Here's a fake facts. It says money doesn't care who owns it.

[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.340]
Oh, that's for the author of the facts you just read. I thought it said from somebody else.

[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.020]
Money doesn't care who owns it. Who be owning it.

[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:59.320]
And the Fender Holyfield. We've got kids by 172 different women.

[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.060]
Nice going, Fender. What are you doing? A lot, obviously.

[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:10.900]
It says looks like Elliot Rodriguez recently let go from Channel 10 after seven years as the 5 30 anchor is high on the list of candidates.

[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.560]
To replace Cambrale Martian as Ann Roberts sidekick on Channel 4 news.

[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:20.980]
Channel 4 general manager Steve Maldon pronounced himself impressed with Roberts mock news cast with Roberts.

[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:25.540]
But station spokesman Lee Zimmerman said no offers been made to be stayed Cuban American.

[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.120]
Stayed. I love that. Who wrote this? This is great.

[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.900]
This is from the Sun Sentinel South Florida insider.

[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.260]
Officially the National Search for Marshall's Replacement is continuing.

[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:41.440]
But with February sweeps approaching station official on somebody new on the set by the end of the month.

[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.480]
Stayed would be a compliment. Okay. Elliot Rodriguez probably a nice guy.

[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.800]
But it's boring as vanilla ice cream. I mean really, really boring.

[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:54.120]
Sorry, Elliot. But I think they got any brains you lose. Which means you probably got the job.

[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.200]
Here's North Miami Beach. Hello. Hello. How you doing? Yes, sir.

[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.240]
Is this place getting, I mean South Florida. I'm back visiting.

[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.820]
It's the first time I've really spent any time down here for about 10 years.

[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:09.080]
I'm so sorry. Is the place getting worse? Yes. It seems every single day.

[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.360]
It's going to be getting dumber and it seems to be getting even more racist when I left.

[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.040]
And it wasn't that racist before I left it. It wasn't racist before you left.

[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.080]
It wasn't racist before you left. I moved to Asheville, North Carolina.

[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.860]
I have to understand the perspective. Everything's relative.

[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:24.500]
Right. Right. It's racist up there. I'm reading in the paper yesterday.

[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:29.220]
I didn't hear if you talked about it or not. Radio host replaced by anti gay rights minister.

[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.840]
The referendum Oscar Aguero was the last guest on the Thomas Garcia West Asian.

[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.760]
Well, that's old news. Yeah. That's old news.

[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.720]
What's going on with this place? It's getting as bad as Asheville is.

[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.820]
Yeah. Well, is that something new? Homophobic Cubans in town?

[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.440]
Is that something new? Homophobic old Cubans from Domino Park?

[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.640]
Yeah. What? Not a coin. Not a coin. Well, they got all that out of shape because they parked the gay rights thing in Dave County.

[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.100]
So they got all psychotic about that. And they ran back into closet and started hanging out to pee room at Westland.

[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.600]
And they got all ben on the ship.

[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.940]
They had to go check the ones hanging out at the glory holes.

[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.760]
That's what I'm talking about. Westland.

[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.600]
All right. Thanks a lot. I was afraid it was getting worse. You seem to be confirming that.

[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.700]
Okay. I'm glad I could confirm your suspicion.

[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:06.960]
I'd like to know.

[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.020]
Thank you.

[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.020]
Good luck to you, pal.

[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.400]
Okay. See you in Asheville. We have an open line of Dave, one and Brad.

[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.800]
Come on. Let's go. I want to see all these people out there who are excited about the NBA.

[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.740]
So that's what's his name. Jericho can get all a stage. Yeah. Told you so.

[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.160]
Told you so, mother.

[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.960]
Never heard of a stupid person being a multi-millionaire.

[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.060]
I mean, there's one of the greatest lines in the history of the human freaking race. Okay.

[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:35.260]
All those really bright jocks who can't even spell their own goddamn name.

[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.080]
We don't know what goddamn day of the week it is. Okay.

[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.780]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line.

[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.460]
Here's a mobile in Pompato B. Tello.

[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.960]
Hey, Neil. How are you this morning?

[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:47.620]
Okay, sir.

[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:52.200]
Gara, just calling you're right on with this NBA staff.

[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:59.440]
I could care less if it ever comes back. Guys are a bunch of overpaid non-brainers.

[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.860]
And the joke is really on the fan to go and pay to watch these guys. It's pathetic.

[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:11.300]
Yeah. Now, are you on happy because I talk about black people, however, the gibberish I do? Are you on happy about it?

[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.500]
Absolutely not. I don't think you're racist at all. You just call in...

[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.100]
You got it. Okay. Thanks. The other great day, pal.

[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.960]
Okay. Now come these lines aren't smoking here this morning. God, what is wrong with his audience with this town?

[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:29.560]
This guy that called two calls ago was right. It's getting worse and worse and worse and worse. Okay.

[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.000]
Jesus Christ. I mean, Jerry says these people are all whipped up to a friend.

[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.620]
He is right on the front page of the hero. So it must be the most important thing going on in the world.

[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:38.860]
Isn't it? No. Yes, it is.

[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.740]
These people are emotional about it.

[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:48.640]
And if I'm a god damn racist, let's cut like I said, call a spade of space, put the cards right out there on the table.

[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:59.780]
And these little kids, by the way, the 15 and the 13 year old brother from Hollywood being held on charges that they admittedly, that they repeatedly rape their eight year old half sister,

[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:04.520]
as wide as they told investigators we saw it on the jury springer show. Okay.

[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:09.780]
This is just like Ronnie Zamora and Ellis Rubin 20 some years ago with a TV intoxication.

[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:15.200]
And then on the local news this morning, we got some sociologists on there. Well, it is true that children are impressionable.

[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:23.100]
You tell me a 15 and 13 year old that don't know the difference between right and wrong as far as raping their little half sister or any other little girl.

[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.960]
And I'll show you something that needs to be, you know, put in a rubber room for the rest of their lives.

[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:34.820]
Everything is always well. We saw we're impressionable. We're too stupid to know the difference between right and wrong.

[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:43.080]
So let's blame the guy the man as much as anxious as the jury, springer show is and believe me it is as anxious as it is.

[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:50.880]
It is not responsible for the social ills of America today. I know that comes as a great shock. Here's Miami Lake. Hello.

[00:29:51.460 --> 00:30:01.180]
Hey Neil, first time call here. Yes, sir. I'm excited. The only reason why I'm excited about the NBA coming back is because I sell screen printing equipment and supplies and we need to get them teachers printed.

[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:11.480]
Yeah, there you go. Here's the guy again that wants to exploit those poor freaks of nature. Hey, you know what? That's putting a dent in my sales. So, you know, we got to get out there these baboons got to get out there start playing.

[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:20.540]
So I can sell some more ink to put on these jerseys. Okay, good luck pal. Let's play it all one place. We have an open line of day one and powered five six seven o'clock five sixty pound five sixty.

[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:37.880]
On the mobile one line. Let's hear from some other people out there whose children have committed abhorrent crimes because you made the bad mistake of not supervising their TV viewing habits and a lot of them to watch the jury, springer show. Come on. Let's get kids who went out and murdered their neighbor. Kids who, you know, gave their dog a burium animal because they sought out a jury, springer show.

[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:48.140]
Kids who hang out in the back halls at school going, Jerry, Jerry, because they sought out a jury, springer show. Let's hear it. Come on. We won't identify it. Here's Miami. Hello.

[00:30:50.020 --> 00:31:02.000]
Miami. Yes, Neil. Yes, sir. First time call us. Okay. I just come in about the headlines. The hell's is pretty. Okay, open line of days five six seven o'clock five sixty and five five sixty on the mobile one line.

[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:26.580]
Freddie. Isn't it? That Freddie. What is your name? That's okay. We have an open line in the day one in Broward five six seven o'five six day. Are these people going to respond to what I'm talking about?

[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:39.700]
Fat Rich is doing fine. Norm can't is doing fine. My little dog is doing fine. I'm doing a radio show. I'm talking about stuff. Are you listening to what I'm saying? Are can you respond to what I'm talking about here today? Jesus Christ. That guy was right.

[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:50.940]
Thank God we started right out of the box today with a guy who's come back here from Astral North Carolina. All places and still can't believe how dumb it is here. You are absolutely correct.

[00:31:51.320 --> 00:32:04.640]
Sir. Jesus Joseph and saw or don't put on any more people over the age of a hundred. I refuse to do that anymore. I'm not talking to see that old parts about fast Freddie or whatever the hell's name is. Fat Freddie.

[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:15.940]
Oh my God. Anybody know how fat Freddie is doing? No. I don't think there's never. Look some copper beams and a nice candy.
